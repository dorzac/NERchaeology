ABSTRACT
Between October 11 and November 3, 2010, Blanton and Associates Inc. (B&A) conducted featurefocused data-recovery excavations and geoarcheological studies at prehistoric sites 41VV2012 and
41VV2013 within the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop. The investigation was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 5766. Archeologists excavated five cultural features consisting of thermal and
non-thermal rock features at 41VV2012 and 13 thermal rock features at 41VV2013. Dr. Stephen Hall
conducted the geoarcheological assessment, concluding that both sites are primarily located atop ancient
eroded/deflated surfaces. Therefore, the potential for buried cultural deposits was limited to thin clayey
and rocky colluvium derived from the nearby Buda Limestone (Upper Cretaceous) and weathered Del Rio
Clay (Cretaceous).
Special analyses conducted on samples collected during feature-focused data recovery included
radiocarbon dating of charcoal by Beta Analytic, Inc., macrobotanical analysis by Dr. Phil Dering of
Shumla Archeobotany Services, soil texture and chemistry identification at Milwaukee Soil Laboratory,
and pollen analysis by Dr. Vaughn Bryant of the Texas A&M University’s Palynology Laboratory.
Additionally, plain earthenware pottery sherds were submitted to Dr. David Robinson for macroscopic
analysis.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
During June 16–18, 2010, archeologists from Blanton and Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of Pate
Transportation Partners, LP (PTP) and on behalf of Val Verde County, Texas, conducted intensive survey
investigations at four post-review discoveries (Discoveries 1 through 4) within the proposed 13-mile long
Del Rio Outer Loop right-of-way (ROW) northeast of the City of Del Rio. Investigations resulted in the
documentation of Isolated Finds (IFs) 1 and 2 (at Discoveries 1 and 2, respectively) and two previously
unidentified prehistoric archeological sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 (at Discoveries 3 and 4,
respectively). Further, the survey discovered no archeological material at the coordinates provided for two
nearby sites (41VV1988 and 41VV1989) recorded during the original 2006 archeological survey of the
Del Rio Outer Loop. Additionally, B&A did not observe any scatter of artifacts between 41VV2012 and
the reported location of 41VV1988 or between 41VV2013 and the reported location of 41VV1989.
B&A returned to 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 between June 22 and 24, 2010, to place temporary protective
fencing around both sites to prevent additional impacts from occurring until survey results could be
evaluated by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The fencing measure allowed construction vehicles to continue using the existing extensively
disturbed construction haul road along the southern part of the ROW at site 41VV2012. At 41VV2013,
the protective fencing restricted access to the northern half of the ROW to prevent impacts to the site.
On June 28, 2010, B&A submitted an interim letter report on the results of the post-review survey to
TxDOT and the THC for review and concurrence to allow construction to continue at IFs 1 and 2, as well
as briefly discuss the results of the post-review investigations and attendant recommendations for sites
41VV2012 and 41VV2013. On June 30, 2010, TxDOT concurred with B&A’s recommendations that: 1)
construction could proceed at IF 1 and IF 2 as no additional work was warranted and 2), additional
feature-focused investigations (e.g., excavations) were necessary at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. It was
further recommended by TxDOT that both sites should be treated as eligible for inclusion to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (as per eligibility criteria set forth in National Park Service
regulations 36 CFR 60.4.) and formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) listing (as per criteria
established in Chapter 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas) and that data recovery excavations be
undertaken at both sites under a single data recovery permit. The THC concurred on July 2, 2010. B&A
submitted a formal draft report of the survey investigations to TxDOT and THC on July 30, 2010.
Between October 11 and 16, 2010, B&A conducted feature-focused data-recovery excavations and
geoarcheological studies at prehistoric site 41VV2012. Six prehistoric features (Features 9, 13, 14, 17, 18,
and 19) were originally recommended for excavations: four thermal features (Features 9, 14, 17, and 18)
and two unburned sandstone slab alignments (Features 13 and 19). During data recovery, four contiguous
1-x-1 meter2 (m2) units were excavated at five features, resulting in a total of 20 excavated units. Data
recovery also included the excavation of six randomly sampled (stratified) control 1-x-1 m2 units and
three geoarcheological backhoe trenches. Dr. Stephen Hall conducted a geoarcheological assessment of
41VV2012, concluding that the site is sitting atop an ancient colluvial surface with discontinuous veneers
of silty and clayey eolian deposits overlying parts of the site. Data recovery indicated there is little
potential for the recovery of intact archeological material.

On 26 October 2010, TxDOT archeologists Dr. James Abbott and Mr. Christopher Ringstaff conducted a
field visit to 41VV2012 to discuss the results of the data recovery and observe the excavated features and
site stratigraphy; at that time the sixth feature (Feature 9), recommended for data recovery, had not been
excavated. During the field visit, it was posited whether the excavation of Feature 9 was warranted. Based
on the paucity of intact subsurface components associated with Features 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19 (and the
site as a whole), a very low density artifact assemblage, Dr. Hall’s geoarcheological assessment, and the
redundancy of data collected from the excavated features, all parties agreed that Feature 9 did not warrant
excavation and data recovery at 41VV2012 was complete. As such, B&A recommended that the
construction of the Del Rio Outer Loop at 41VV2012 should be allowed to proceed as planned without
additional investigations.
Between October 16, 2010 and November 3, 2010, B&A conducted feature-focused data recovery (with
geoarcheological studies) at prehistoric site 41VV2013. Thirteen prehistoric thermal features (Features 1,
3 through 6 and 8 through 15) were recommended for excavation; of these, six received four contiguous
1-x-1 m2 excavation units, three received five contiguous units, and four were eventually abandoned due
to poor subsurface integrity. A total of 39 1-x-1 m2 units was excavated. Data recovery at 41VV2013 also
included the excavation of six randomly sampled (stratified) control 1-x-1 m2 units and multiple
exploratory and geoarcheological backhoe trenches across the site.
On 26 October 2010, TxDOT archeologists Mr. Chris Ringstaff and Dr. James Abbott conducted a field
visit to 41VV2013 to discuss the results of the on-going data recovery; at that time Features 4, 6, 9, 11,
12, and 14 had yet to be excavated. During the field visit it was discussed whether the excavation of those
features was warranted, given the relative lack of intact subsurface components associated with the
previously excavated features (and the redundancy of the excavation data), a low-density artifact
assemblage, and Dr. Hall’s geoarcheological assessment. All parties agreed to modify the scope of work
to streamline the remaining data recovery efforts at Features 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, and 14. This was
accomplished by troweling away the loose overburden within the four contiguous 1-x-1 m2 units at each
feature. If shovel troweling exposed intact subsurface components, then excavations were to proceed as
normal. Based on poor integrity and a lack of buried components, Features 4, 6, 9, and 11 were eventually
terminated. Following the 26 October 2010 field visit, B&A completed feature-focused data recovery at
41VV2013 on 3 November 2010.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The authors would like to thank a number of individuals for the successful completion of data recovery,
analysis, and report production for sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The results of the data recovery offer
insight into the Late Prehistoric exploitation of upland settings in the Lower Pecos River region near Del
Rio, Texas. The hard work of field, logistics, and laboratory personnel, as well as various analysts and
staff of several organizations is greatly appreciated.
The field crew included Joseph Sanchez (Project Archeologist); Mark Willis (Crew Chief and TDS
operator/cartographer); and Diamond Kappaday, Greg Sundborg, Walker van Item, Nancy Porter, Olga
Torres, Cesario Guerra, and Jim Quaranta (Field Archeologists). Were it not for the efforts of these
individuals under a tight timeline, data recovery would not have proceeded as professionally and
successfully as it did.
Recognition is due to Mr. Terry Plucker of PTP (on behalf of Val Verde County) for his unfailing help
and logistical assistance during the entire project. His personal interest in the archeology is greatly
appreciated.
Dr. Scott Pletka, Dr. Jim Abbott, and Mr. Christopher Ringstaff of the Environmental Affairs Division of
TxDOT provided guidance and support throughout all stages of the investigations.
Project Geomorphologist, Dr. Stephen Hall, is heartily thanked for his efforts and extensive knowledge
base.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

INTRODUCTION
The proposed Del Rio Outer Loop right-of-way (ROW) is located north-northeast of the City of Del Rio
in Val Verde County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). It measures approximately 13-miles long and varies
between 250 and 680 feet (ft.) wide. The proposed Outer Loop will connect US Highway (US) 90 (east of
Del Rio) to US 277 (north of Del Rio). The project area was surveyed in 2006 for cultural resources on
behalf of TxDOT (Galindo and Chavez 2006a; Galindo and Chavez 2006b). The investigation resulted in
the recording of prehistoric sites 41VV1988, 41VV1989, and 41VV1990 (Galindo and Chavez 2006a;
Galindo and Chavez 2006b). Prehistoric sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 were later exposed during
highway construction in June 2010; Blanton & Associates (B&A) were contracted to conduct an intensive
non-collection archeological survey of the impacted area (Young et al. 2010, TAC 5670).
Following the intensive survey B&A recommended in an interim letter report (Young et al. 2010), that
significance testing of select features located within the project ROW at sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013
was warranted. Both the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) concurred with the recommendations; however, to expedite the conclusion of
construction, TxDOT choose to treat both sites as eligible for inclusion to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and as warranting State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation (pursuant to
13 TAC 26.8). Before construction could proceed, data recovery investigations, consisting of featurefocused excavations, were required. In response to the depositional setting and density of features at
41VV2013, TxDOT requested that a geoarcheological assessment, systematic backhoe trenching, and
limited surface scraping be added to the investigation. Upon review and acceptance of a detailed Scope of
Work (SOW), the THC assigned Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5766 to Principal Investigator Brandon S.
Young; Project Archeologist Joseph M. Sanchez supervised field investigations. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) consisted of a total of approximately 9.6 acres with 3.4 acres at site 41VV2012 and 6.2
acres at site 41VV2013 located within the project ROW. Both sites extend beyond the project APE and
would require additional investigations to fully investigate the site. If future impacts are proposed beyond
the current APE, additional archeological investigations would be warranted.
Between October 11 and November 3, 2010, B&A conducted feature-focused data-recovery excavations
and geoarcheological studies at sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The mitigation plan included
geoarcheological assessment, detailed site mapping and surficial artifact mapping using a Total Data
Station (TDS), systematic excavation of 21 backhoe trenches, 75 hand-excavated 1 m2 units, and 12 handexcavated 1 m2 control units for a total of 176.57 m3 of excavated site sediments, and the collection of
soil, charcoal, and flotation samples from features. Archeologists excavated five thermal and non-thermal
rock features at 41VV2012 and 13 thermal rock features at 41VV2013.
Because the project occurred on property owned by Val Verde County (a political subunit of the State of
Texas) and TxDOT will eventually purchase the Del Rio Outer Loop from Val Verde County upon
completion, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in
Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political subdivision
of the State of Texas must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that

could potentially damage those SALs. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to eligibility
for SAL listing pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Additionally, as the Del Rio Outer Loop project is utilizing
funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the construction is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Consideration of archeological
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP, which depends on criteria defined by
National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60.
The following chapters provide an environmental and cultural history background; introduce the project
setting and site descriptions; present the research design and excavation methodology; provide the
description of investigations; provide the results of the investigations, detail the material culture and the
archeological analysis; and the present the results of the investigation with summary and
recommendations. The appendices present the formal geomorphological study, the backhoe trench data
and profiles, the radiocarbon results, botanical and pollen analyses, the ceramic study, provenience data
for the entire collection, and the lithic use-wear analysis.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is in central Val Verde County within the Lower Pecos River region (Lower Pecos). This
particular area occupies the western margins of the Edwards Plateau, a vast tableland of limestone ridges
exhibiting deep canyons incised by rivers, such as the Pecos and Devil’s Rivers, and their tributaries like
San Felipe Creek in Del Rio that drains the uplands within the Del Rio Outer Loop project area before
flowing into the Rio Grande. The Lower Pecos is within a transitional zone among several distinct
environmental areas or biotic provinces (e.g., Balconian, Chihuahuan, and Tamaulipan) (Blair 1950). This
unique setting blends flora and fauna from the three biotic provinces, resulting in an admixture of species
from central, south, and west Texas.
Throughout the Lower Pecos region is a varied and extensive archeological record indicating a rich and
successful aboriginal occupation of the area from approximately 10,000 years Before Present (BP)
through the Historic era (ca.16th through late 19th centuries). This environment provided not only the
critical resources of food and water, but also protected shelter in the form of large rockshelters and
overhangs eroded out of the expanse of limestone ridges in canyons and overlooking the Devil’s and
Pecos Rivers (and larger tributaries in the area). Open alluvial terraces and upland limestone ridges and
hill slopes (like at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013) also offered areas for open camps where repeat long term
and/or brief occupations for special tasks (e.g., resource procurement and processing) occurred. The rivers
and drainages also provided water and aquatic resources including fish, snakes, mussels, birds, and
mammals to name a few. Further, the limestone geology of the area is ideal for springs (such as San
Felipe Springs in Del Rio) and seeps, both of which were readily available to prehistoric groups familiar
with a given area.
The underlying geology in the APE consists of Upper Cretaceous-age Buda Limestone and Cretaceousage Del Rio Clay. There is no recent (Holocene) alluvium mapped within the study area. The majority of
the APE contains Buda Limestone that is found on eroded upland ridges. The formation is massive with
an overall thickness of 45 to 100 feet. Del Rio Clay is calcareous and gypsiferous clay with common
marine fossils and pyrite inclusions. The carbonate geology offered not only shelter but also abundant raw
materials for stone tool production in the form of chert and flint from exposed seams and outcrops. In
addition to siliceous lithic resources, the area provided ample stone and rock (e.g., limestone, sandstone,
siltstone, etc.) for hearths and other burned and fire-cracked rock features for cooking and/or heat and
light. Equally as important as the consumable resources were the rivers and associated drainages
themselves that served as natural highways through the often rugged and steep terrain.
Soils in the APE are from the Zorra series (1 to 15 percent slopes) and are characteristic of the hilly to
undulating uplands in the northern part of the Del Rio Outer Loop. The Zorra series consists of very stony
to stony loamy upland soil overlying caliche and limestone bedrock. In a typical profile, Zorra soils
exhibit stony grayish loam from 0 to about 20 centimeters (cm) below ground surface that is
approximately 23 percent by volume limestone and caliche fragments. From 20 to 30 cm below ground
surface, the series exhibits indurated white caliche overlying limestone bedrock. The Zorra series soils
developed in situ from caliche and limestone bedrock.

The flora of the region provided ample resources for prehistoric groups’ economies and subsistence.
Floral resources exploited during prehistory and documented in the archeological record in the region
include honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), ocotillo (Fouquieria
splendens), guayacan (Porlieria angustifolia), sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum) and cactus such as prickly
pear (Opuntia sp.). Fuel wood utilized by prehistoric inhabitants of the region included woody upland
trees (e.g., mesquite) and brush (e.g., tarbush (Flourensia sp.), as well as riparian species—cottonwood
(Populus arizonica), oak (Quercus sp.), hackberry (Celtis sp.), and pecan (Carya illinoinensis). The soils
at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 support thorny and woody brush, as well as grasses typical of the
Chihuahuan Desert. Dominant species on both sites include honey mesquite, guayacan, creosote bush,
buffelgrass, and Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri).
Modern climate conditions in the Lower Pecos region and Val Verde County are semiarid with very hot
summers and mild winters. Summer (late May through September) temperatures are intense, frequently in
excess of 100 Fahrenheit (F), while the winter months are mild with few long term freezes (Golden et al.
1985:2). Based on data collected between 1937 and 1976, Val Verde County has average summer
temperatures in the 90s F, with an average maximum temperature of 98 F. In the winter, the average
temperature is 53 F with an average daily low of 40 F. The average rainfall for the county is
approximately 18.4 inches and primarily falls from April to October (Golden et al. 1982:2).

REGIONAL ARCHEOLOGY
The Lower Pecos River area is part of the larger Trans-Pecos region originally defined by Suhm et al.
(1954) as including all of Texas west of the Pecos River as well as Val Verde County. Geographically, the
region is centered on the confluence of the Rio Grande with the Pecos and Devils Rivers. The Lower
Pecos River area is well known for the Pecos River style pictographs and rockshelters in the bluffs
overlooking the Pecos River. A number of significant archeological excavations at rockshelters and
alluvial terrace sites with deep stratified prehistoric cultural deposits in the region provide critical data,
particularly regarding culture chronology (see Dibble 1965, 1967; Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Schaefer and
Bryant 1977; Hester 1983; and Bement 1986). By extrapolation, archeologists developed chronologies for
adjacent regions based on the presence of similar diagnostic artifacts (primarily projectile points and, to a
lesser extent, ceramics).
More common than spectacular rockshelters and rock art sites are open sites in both upland and lowland
contexts that often contain thermal features and associated artifact scatters. Common burned and firecracked rock features include hearths, middens, and amorphous burned rock scatters or concentrations.
These sites appear to demonstrate a long occupation of the region, focused primarily on areas where water
is permanently or seasonally available, and featuring specialized extraction/processing activities
represented by the thermal features. While burned rock middens may represent a relatively specialized
extractive pursuit, the ubiquity of thermal features in the region indicates a successful long-lived
continuum of prehistoric subsistence and technological adaptations (see Bement 1989).
The following is a synthesis of available data concerning the prehistory and previous archeological
investigations of the Lower Pecos River region. See Bement (1989) and Turpin (1995, 2004) for a more
comprehensive review of the regional research.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Formal archeological investigations in the Lower Pecos River region began in the 1930s with excavation
projects sponsored by various institutions, such as The University of Texas at Austin, the Witte Museum
of San Antonio, and the Smithsonian Institution. Important sites excavated by these institutions in Val
Verde County include Eagle Cave (41VV167), the Shumla Caves (41VV112 and 41VV113), and Fate
Bell Shelter (41VV74); all of which yielded extremely well-preserved, typically perishable cultural
materials such as sandals, rope, clothing, bedding, wood and bone artifacts, mats, netting, basketry, and
human burials retaining some skin and hair, etc.
Limited formal archaeological investigations occurred in the area during the early to mid-1940s, which
were temporarily halted during World War II. In their seminal 1940 publication, Kelley et al. (1940)
divided the Trans-Pecos into eight cultural foci defined by a series of traits derived from comparisons
among assemblages of excavated cultural material. One of the eight constructs is the Pecos River focus
derived from excavations in Fate Bell Shelter (type-site).
In the late 1940s, Taylor (1948, 1949) conducted surveys and excavations along the Rio Grande in both
the U.S and Mexico. Taylor proposed that the Pecos River focus was present throughout the Trans-Pecos

region prior to AD 1000, after which time the culture persisted only in the Lower Pecos (Taylor 1949).
Suhm et al. (1954) utilized Taylor’s data in their summary of the proposed Lower Pecos cultural
sequence.
The Water Treaty of 1944 between the United States and Mexico initiated an extensive series of
archeological investigations in the Lower Pecos River region during the 1950s and 1960s prior to the
construction of a series of dams and reservoirs, including the Amistad National Recreation Area and
Falcon Reservoir, among others, along the Rio Grande. The NPS was in charge of the extensive inventory
of cultural resources affected by the Amistad impoundment and established the Archeological Salvage
Program Field (ASP) Office in Austin, Texas. E. B. Jelks of The University of Texas at Austin directed
the Texas ASP (Graham and Davis 1958), which pursued research at Amistad Reservoir from the late
1950s to the late 1960s.
The first excavations were associated with the Amistad Reservoir construction at Centipede (41VV191)
and Damp (41VV189) Caves in 1958 by Epstein (1963). Dibble’s (1965) excavations at Bonfire Shelter
(41VV218) identified four and possibly five episodes of use of the site as a bison jump. The earliest bone
bed, possibly the result of human involvement, dated to before 10,000 years ago. Leroy Johnson (1961,
1964) established a projectile point sequence identifying a Paleo-Indian component and three subsequent
Archaic components from the deeply stratified cultural deposits at the Devil’s Mouth site (41VV188).
Story proposed an eight-period chronology using radiocarbon dates and associated projectile points from
these latest excavations (Story and Bryant 1966). Dibble’s (1967) excavations at Arenosa Shelter
(41VV99) provided the longest cultural sequence of stratified, radiocarbon-dated episodes from the
reservoir area. Dibble (1967) hypothesized an 11-part chronology for the Lower Pecos River region based
on his research at Arenosa Shelter and Bonfire Shelter. The salvage investigations and subsequent theses
and dissertations provided an extensive corpus of data concerning Lower Pecos prehistory.
Several major rockshelter sites were excavated in the 1970s by academic institutions. Baker Cave
(41VV503) on the Devils River was excavated in the summer of 1976 by The University of Texas at San
Antonio (Chadderdon 1981; Hester 1983). This excavation yielded both Angostura and Golondrina
projectile point types dated to over 9,000 years ago. The excavated materials from Baker Cave indicted
that lechugilla and sotol were not part of the flora during late Paleoindian times. These plants apparently
were not present in the region until ca. 6,000 B.C. (Hester 1983). Texas A&M University conducted
excavations at Hinds Cave (4VV456) along a tributary of the Pecos River over several seasons. This
excavation provided important data concerning the use of the area and the subsistence base of the
aboriginal occupants (Shafer and Bryant 1977).
A state historical park was created in Seminole and Presa canyons in 1979 and 1980 where many
pictograph sites, including Fate Bell Shelter, are located. The University of Texas at Austin inventoried
the cultural resources within the park for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), recording 38
previously unknown sites and reevaluating 32 previously known sites (Turpin 1982). Several new site
types were located by this survey, including signal fire hearths, oblong burial cairns, and circular stone
alignments (Turpin 1982, 1984). Research in the 1980s focused on rock art sites; as a result, five

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

pictograph styles have been identified: Pecos River, Red Linear, Red Monochrome, Bold Line Geometric,
and Historic (Turpin 1995).
In 1989, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) conducted field school investigations in the Devils River
State Natural Area. The field school survey of the 22,000-acre natural area discovered 158 sites. Five sites
were excavated, including two rockshelters, one sinkhole/cave, and two midden sites (see Tinsley
2009:11).
Acknowledging inconsistencies in the previously established Lower Pecos River Region chronologies
established by Story and Bryant (1966), Collins (1974), Dibble (in Prewitt 1983), and Shafer (1986),
Turpin (1991) synthesized the available radiocarbon dates from sites in and surrounding the region. The
database included 268 uncorrected radiocarbon dates as well as their locations of collection and
associations (e.g., stratigraphic provenience and artifact associations). This resulted in the development of
archaeologically distinctive regional subperiods. Ultimately, the synthesis reflects an analysis of more
than 300 radiocarbon dates from Lower Pecos River Region.
In 1993, De Vore (1993) conducted an assessment of prehistoric and historic resources on Laughlin Air
Force Base, with the recommendation that the main base and recreation areas required a 100 percent
survey. In 1994, additional archeological reconnaissance of Laughlin Air Force Base occurred (Krapf et
al. 1994), followed shortly by a 100 percent survey of the base by the Center for Archaeological Research
(CAR) at The University of Texas at San Antonio (Tennis et al. 1996).
In May 1996, 11 sites at Laughlin Air Force Base were tested by personnel from the Center for Ecological
Archaeology at Texas A&M University (Dering 1998). These test excavations resulted in the
determination that four (41VV1654 and 41VV1688-90) of the prehistoric sites were eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP. These four sites include three on the eastern bank of Sacatosa Creek. Two of these, sites
41VV1689 and 41VV1690, contained artifact-bearing paleosols. The paleosol at site 41VV1690 was
radiocarbon dated to 1,480 ± 250 BP Site 41VV1688 has a thick colluvial mantle with features on the
surface and within the mantle. These NRHP eligible sites are described as having intact features with the
potential to yield information within a datable context. The fourth site (41VV1654) is a large site with
some areas of intact sheet midden containing abundant manufacturing debitage, cores, edge modified
tools, bifaces, and projectile points. Projectile point types identified include Golondrina, Late
Paleoindian/Early Archaic lanceolate fragments, and Early to Late Archaic notched and stemmed dart
points.
CULTURE HISTORY
Researchers note a striking prehistoric cultural and technological continuity throughout much of Lower
Pecos River region until European contact. The hunter-gatherer economy encompassed the collection of
plant resources and the hunting of small and large game. Because of the excellent preservation of organics
and perishable cultural material in the region’s seasonally occupied dry rockshelters, excavations have
yielded an extensive inventory of the material culture of the prehistoric inhabitants. A significant
technological shift occurred around AD 600, with the introduction of ceramics and the bow and arrow.
The four major periods of prehistory and history as defined in the region include Paleoindian, Archaic,

Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric, and Historic; the Archaic is represented by the Early, Middle, and Late
periods. Table 1 presents Turpin’s (2004) regional chronology. The following discussion highlights
major traits and innovations associated with the major periods and associated subperiods outlined by
Turpin (2004). The following chronology is based on more than 300 radiocarbon dates with several
nomenclatures suggested by Turpin (1991). The 1,300 year break between the Aurora and Bonfire
subperiods is reflective of gaps in the regional archeological record.

Paleoindian Period (ca. <12,000-9,800 BP)
Paleoindian groups were nomadic hunter-gatherers. There was an emphasis on the pursuit of now-extinct
megafauna such as mammoth and bison (e.g., Bison antiquus), in tandem with general foraging/collecting
of plant foods. Temporal diagnostics of the early Paleoindian period are lanceolate fluted Clovis projectile
points followed by Folsom. Locally, this period is estimated to have begun prior to 12,000 BP and ended
approximately 9,800 BP, and is divided into the Aurora, Bonfire, and Oriente subperiods.
Aurora Subperiod (pre 12,000 B.P)
Evidence of Paleoindian occupation of the Lower Pecos River Region during the Aurora subperiod is
largely based on the presence of culturally burned and/or modified faunal remains of extinct species at the
sites of Cueva Quebrada and Bonfire Shelter. At Cueva Quebrada, Paleoindian associations are based on
the presence of burned and scattered bone that produced a radiocarbon date that coincides with the Aurora
Subperiod (Lundelius 1984). Several of the bone beds at Bonfire Shelter display faunal modification that
is consistent with butchering techniques although stone tools were not found in association with the
remains (Bement 1986; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Based on the existing data for this subperiod, it appears
that evidence for human occupation of the region at this time is lacking and any attempts to model human
behavior or interpret subsistence strategies would be premature.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Bonfire Subperiod (10,700-9,800 B.P)
Other bone beds at the Bonfire Shelter did produce stone tools in the form of Paleoindian projectile points
that are classified as belonging to the Folsom and Plainview types (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Although
the discovery of Paleoindian projectile points at the Bonfire Shelter is not disputed, the means by which
they became intermixed with the bison remains has been a recent topic of discussion (see Byerly et al.
2005, 2007; Prewitt 2007). The original interpretation of Bonfire Shelter contended that the bones were
deposited as a result of human influence (e.g., the use of one or multiple drive lines and a jump). This idea
was posited by Dibble and Lorrain (1968) and is maintained by Prewitt (2007). Byerly et al. (2005, 2007)
have offered the alternative hypothesis that the faunal remains represent a processing, rather than a kill,
assemblage.
Late Paleoindian Period (ca. 9,400 to 8,800 BP)
Oriente Subperiod (9,400 to 8,800 B.P)
The terminal Paleoindian stage for the region is the Oriente subperiod, which represents a transitional
period into the subsequent Archaic Period (see below) as groups adapted to drier climates. The phase is
regionally defined from Baker Cave and other sites based on the presence of Golondrina and Angostura
projectile points (Tinsley 2009:17). Other artifactual indicators within the cave suggest a broad resource
economy that was not solely focused on big game (Hester 1983) and the intensification of fiber
production (Andrews and Adovasio 1980).
Early Archaic Period (ca. 9,000 to 6,000 BP)
The Early Archaic Period is classified into a single subperiod referred to as the Viejo Subperiod. Turpin
(2004:269) stated that, “as currently defined, [the Late Archaic Period/Viejo Subperiod] is far too long
and amorphous to be considered a meaningful cultural unit.” However, it is during this time that the
archeological record begins to exhibit numerous thermal and non-thermal cultural features, such as
burned rock middens, hearths, slab and grass-lined pits, and refuse dumps, along with the appearance of
basketry, cordage, and a variety of projectile point types including Baker, Bandy, Uvalde, Gower,
Martindale, and the Early Barbed series (Turpin 2004:270). Archaic subsistence data indicates a
generalized forager-collector diet of small animals, reptiles, and vegetation including sotol, agave, and
yucca (Dering 1999).
Viejo Subperiod (8,900-5,500)
The Viejo subperiod represents the earliest archaeological evidence for the preferred use of rockshelters
in the Lower Pecos River Region. It is also during this period that portable art may have begun as
evidenced by the discovery of painted pebbles and unbaked or poorly-fired clay figurines (Turpin
2004:270). Turpin (1988) has also argued that the mixed demographics of 21 sets of human remains
recovered from the Seminole Sink site could be indicative of the beginnings of an egalitarian social
structure in the region.

Middle Archaic Period (6,000-3,000 B.P)
The Middle Archaic Period correlates with the wax and wane of the Altithermal climatic event that was
largely responsible for reshaping the floral and faunal communities in the Lower Pecos Region.
Grasslands that had already started to recede during the Early Archaic were replaced with plant species
which were adapted to a desert environment (Dering 1999). Environmental stresses resulted in a shift in
human subsistence strategies away from a broad economy to one focused almost exclusively on the
collection, processing, and cooking of lechuguilla, sotol, and yucca (Brown 1991). Mobility patterns were
dictated by the availability of food and fuel resources necessary for creating earth ovens (Dering
1999:670-671).
Eagle Nest Subperiod (5,500-4,100 BP)
A type of projectile point known as Pandale provides an archaeological marker for the Eagle Nest
subperiod, a span of time that was typified by an extremely hot climate that was susceptible to intense
flood episodes. Earth ovens used to process plant materials generated massive amounts of waste plant
materials and stones. This has possibly resulted in a misinterpretation of group sizes as large; however, it
is more likely that smaller groups could more easily exploit the natural resources without depleting them
(Dering 1999).
San Felipe Subperiod (4,100-3,200 BP)
Regionalization of the Lower Pecos River Region seems to have begun during the San Felipe subperiod.
Projectile point styles such as Langtry, Valverde, and Arenosa become prominent and the first and most
complicated of four pictograph styles appear (Turpin 2004:270). The process of regionalization would
have been expedited by a decrease of upland water available that would have forced groups to aggregate
along the lowland water sources that dissected the region (e.g., major rivers and seasonally flowing
tributaries). Increased sedentism, while still relying upon plant resources, likely resulted in a shift from
foraging to task-oriented collecting. Changes in mobility and subsistence may have also plausibly led to
changes in social structure although few researchers have speculated about the type and extent of those
changes (Turpin 2004:272).
Late Archaic Period (3,000-1,000 BP)
The Late Archaic experienced a brief episode of wetter conditions that brought larger bison herds back
into the area by expanding prairie grasslands. Projectile points found in association with a number of
these faunal assemblages indicate that the herds may have been followed to the Lower Pecos River
Region by human hunters from Central Texas. Pictographic rock art styles appear during the Late Archaic
Period and often display imagery that has sometimes allowed researchers the ability to make inferences
regarding social structure, mobility patterns, and subsistence strategies.
Cibola Subperiod (3,150-2,300 BP)
Diagnostic projectile points from this time include Marshall, Montell, and Castroville, all of which are
found with decreasing frequencies in rockshelters and increasing frequencies in the uplands. The second
of the four local pictograph styles, Red Linear, is thought to have appeared during this phase based on the

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

depiction of bison imagery (Bement 1989; Turpin 1995). All available evidence suggests that although
earth ovens continued in use, group mobility was expanding.
Flanders Subperiod (2,300-? BP)
Turpin (2004:273) has referred to the Flanders subperiod as, “the most elusive time period in the regional
chronology for the Lower Pecos.” The characteristic dart point type known as Shumla has not yet been
dated intensively, though the date obtained by Mehalchick et al. (1999:158) of ca.350 BC (2,300 BP) is
thought to be the best representation of age for this point type. Pictograph panels are tentatively linked to
the subperiod although hypotheses regarding subsistence strategies and social organization are lacking.
Blue Hills Subperiod (2,300–1,300 BP)
During the Blue Hills subperiod the primary projectile points, Ensor and Frio, occurred across much of
Texas (Prewitt 1995). During this time, more elaborate fiber works became common and bundled human
remains and cremations were placed in rockshelters along with utilitarian grave goods (Turpin 2004:274).
Sites dating to this period tend to be located in upland areas with associated tool assemblages reflecting
plant processing, possibly demonstrating another shift in climate that affected local plant and animal
populations and resulting in a return to an economy focused largely on plant processing.
Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric Period (ca. 1,000 to 350 BP)
During the Late Prehistoric period, groups continued occupying rockshelters but were clearly exploiting
and occupying uplands, as evidenced in the presence of circular stone rings and cairn burials. Regionally
at this time, the Red Monochrome pictograph style may first appear, as does the bow and arrow.
Triangular arrow points, plain ceramics, steeply beveled end scrapers, and prismatic blades appear in
artifact assemblages at this time (Bement 1989; Turpin 1995).
During the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods emerged an archeological culture identified as
Toyah (ca. AD 1300 to 1350), which is sparsely represented in the Lower Pecos but common across much
of the Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas. In essence, Toyah culture is believed to represent
mobile foraging/collecting groups that emphasized bison hunting. It is felt that the culture developed in
response to the return of bison to central Texas during the late 11th to early 12th centuries, as bison bones
are common at Toyah sites. Prior to that time, bison were absent from Texas for approximately 700 years.
The Toyah culture or “horizon” (Black 1986) has been defined and refined by many researchers since the
1940s (e.g., Kelley 1947; Suhm et al. 1954; Jelks 1962; Shafer 1971; and others). More recently,
however, Toyah research has focused on variation observed among Toyah toolkits from one region of
Texas to another (Collins 2004: 122-123; Hester 2004: 143-150; Ricklis 2004a: 171-175; Ricklis
2004b:194-196).
Toyah culture, particularly its material culture, is described as being represented by either “classic” or
“shared” material culture (Johnson 1994). Johnson (1994:187-210, 269) suggested Perdiz arrow points,
beveled knives, scrapers, various perforators, a flake/blade technology, undecorated bone-tempered
ceramics, and bison faunal remains/tools belong to the classic Toyah horizon. Recognizing that the
presence of bison was not consistent across Texas at that time, Johnson (1994) postulated that the classic
Toyah toolkit was diffused from a specific point/area of an original Toyah cultural occupation. From that
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

13

origin point, Toyah culture and/or its toolkit spread to cultural groups less reliant on bison hunting. Thus,
those groups then selectively altered the classic Toyah toolkit to fit regionally specific needs and/or
constraints, effectively creating what Johnson (1994) termed a shared Toyah toolkit.
Flecha Subperiod (1,300–450 BP)
Sometime between AD 600 and 900, the human groups of the Lower Pecos River Region adopted bow
and arrow technology (Turpin 2004:274). A technological shift in plant processing is also observed
archaeologically with ring middens-burned rock accumulations in the shape of a crescent-appearing in
open sites. Special attention seems to have been paid to burials with the deceased individuals being given
care prior to and/or in death. The use of cairn burials also seems to gain some prominence during the
Flecha Subperiod; however, this type of interment is more common to the north and west of the Lower
Pecos. Finally, two new pictograph styles, Red Monochrome and Bold Line Geometrics, appear at this
time.
Infierno Subperiod (450–250 BP)
A limited number of sites have been linked to the Infierno subperiod and these are generally located on
prominent topography uphill from permanent water sources. Site assemblages are generally characterized
by circles of paired stone that may have supported structures (e.g., wikiups or tipis). Turpin (2004:276)
describes toolkits as being dominated by small triangular stemmed arrow points, steeply beveled end
scrapers (Bement and Turpin 1987), four-bevel knives, and plain ceramics (Turpin and Robinson 1998)
reminiscent of Toyah toolkit. Projectile point styles include Scallorn, Perdiz, Livermore and Toyah arrow
points (Bement 1989; Turpin 1995). Relatively few ceramics (less than 100 total sherds from 13 sites,
including 41VV2013) have been discovered in the Lower Pecos and those fragments that have been
recovered are poorly fired bone and calcium carbonate-tempered plainware that is considered a diagnostic
of the Infierno subperiod (Turpin and Robinson 1998: 89–97). Interestingly, the bone and calcium
carbonate-temper and poor firing are diagnostic of Leon Plainware associated with the Toyah horizon.
Historic Period (250 B.P to Present)
Contact with Anglo-Europeans by groups in the Lower Pecos River Region presumably began prior to the
1590 crossing of the Rio Grande by Gaspar Castaño de Sosa’s party on their way to the Pecos Pueblo
(Hamond and Rey 1966; Schroeder and Matson 1965). Although the Spanish government never
established a permanent settlement in the Lower Pecos (Turpin 2004:277-278), historic documents reveal
they were allied to or were militarily engaged with at least five tribes in the area. These tribes included the
Jumanos, Cibolos, Apache, Comanche, and Kiowa (Turpin 2004:278). Later conflicts over land between
Native Americans tribes and European American governments eventually led to a loss of control of the
Lower Pecos by indigenous populations in 1882 (Turpin 2004:278). The recent data recovery excavations
in the Del Rio Outer Loop discovered no evidence (e.g., European trade goods such as glass beads or
metal arrow points) that suggests occupation of the sites by historic-era groups.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

PROJECT SETTING AND SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The project area is in the archeologically defined Lower Pecos River Area centered on the Pecos, Devils
and Rio Grande Rivers, which are several kilometers northwest of 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The sites
are approximately 1,000 m apart within the northern end of the Del Rio Outer Loop. Both sites contain
unnamed tributaries of San Felipe Creek (Figure 3), a major local stream that flows across the local hilly
and rocky limestone uplands to the southwest through Del Rio and into the Rio Grande. The proposed
two-lane roadway measures 13 miles in length. Although the width of the construction impact area, as
proposed, measures between 38 and 107 m (125 and 350 ft.), the project APE measures between 76 and
207 m (250 and 680 ft.) to cover minor changes in design and future roadway expansion. At sites
41VV2012 and 41VV2013, the ROW width measures between 150 and 190 m, and 135 and 175 m,
respectively.
During the initial data recovery, all construction and construction traffic was halted in the areas of
41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The haul road area of each site was investigated first in an effort to keep the
construction crews working. Both sites lacked intact deposits or features (F) within the haul road, and
active construction resumed during the remainder of the data recovery investigation. Large dump trucks
and other heavy machinery with their associated flare-ups of dust were a constant presence.
41VV2012
Site 41VV2012 is a prehistoric open camp with 20 discrete thermal and non-thermal rock features with a
sparse surface scatter of chipped-stone debitage (siliceous material and chert). The site measures
approximately 150 m north-south by 75 m east-west; however, it extends an unknown distance onto
private property north and south of the APE. The long axis of the site trends north/south with the haul
road bisecting it in half. The site is located on a topographic high emanating from the adjacent ridge tops.
Two unnamed intermittent tributaries of San Felipe Creek flow through and around the southeastern part
of the site. Figure 4 is the site map for 41VV2012 produced during survey investigations—see Figure 6
in “Results of Excavation” for a contour map of 41VV2012.
The southern half of the existing ROW at 41VV2012 was largely mechanically cleared of
brush/vegetation and mechanically scarified resulting in 100 percent (%) visibility in some areas, though
on average, visibility was between 40 and 50 % across the entire site area. The mechanical impacts
displaced cultural material (including features) across the site surface; some materials were undoubtedly
pulled to the surface from shallowly buried contexts. During the surface examination of the site, very few
artifacts and 20 discrete cultural rock features (11 fire-cracked rock scatters, six hearths, and three
unburned sandstone slab clusters) were discovered.
From the inventory of 20 features at 41VV2012 (Table 2), B&A recommended that:
1) Fourteen features (F 1 - 8, 11, 12, 14 - 16 and 18) lacked intact deposits, preserved macrobotanical or
faunal remains, or sufficient lithic assemblage; therefore, these features have low research potential
and no additional work is recommended. With the exception of F 14 which required further assessment
to fully determine its research value;

2) Four of the features (F 9, 13, 19, and 20) were considered to have moderate research value and
excavations were recommended, as they had good potential to provide radiocarbon samples for dating,
technological information concerning feature construction/morphology, macrobotanical and faunal
remains to explore processing and diet/subsistence issues, and data on lithic technologies (e.g.,
chipped-stone and ground stone); and,
3) The remaining two features (F 10 and 17) were considered to have high research value and excavations
were recommended, as they had excellent potential to provide radiocarbon samples for dating,
technological information concerning feature construction/morphology, macrobotanical and faunal
remains to explore processing and diet/subsistence issues, and data on lithic technologies (e.g.,
chipped-stone and ground stone).

41VV2013
Site 41VV2013 is a prehistoric open camp site with 32 discrete thermal rock cultural features. The site
measures approximately 210 m northwest-southeast by 85 m northeast-southwest within the existing
ROW on a sloping hillside and bench above an unnamed tributary of San Felipe Creek.

The site extends an unknown distance onto private property southwest of the proposed ROW. Figure 5 is
the site map for 41VV2013 produced during survey investigations—see Figure 18 in “Results of
Excavation” for a contour map of 41VV2013.
The site artifact assemblage consists of a moderately dense surface scatter of chipped-stone debitage,
several chipped-stone tools, expedient flake tools and groundstone tools. In places, the site has a veneer of
eolian sand, sandy/silty colluviums from the adjacent ridge tops, and possible alluvium from the nearby
drainage. Beneath the veneer is Del Rio Clay. In addition to the multiple cultural features, there was a
concentration of surface artifacts adjacent to F 2–8, 13 and 15. This approximately 27 x 30 m area was
designated Locus A given the density of cultural materials, which suggests the area was a focal point of
activity. No other such concentrations of surface artifacts were discovered on 41VV2013.
Preliminary construction activities for the Del Rio Outer Loop had previously cleared and scarified parts
of the ROW corridor near its southern margins. Some areas at 41VV2013 exhibited 100% visibility,
though visibility averaged approximately 40%.
From an inventory of 32 features at 41VV2013 (Table 3), it was recommended by B&A that:
1) Nineteen features (F 2, 7 and 16 - 32) had little to no potential for buried subsurface components and
were considered to have low research value. No additional work was warranted;
2) Six features (F 1, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 14) were considered to have good potential for subsurface
components. Based on the potential to provide radiocarbon samples for dating, technological
information concerning feature construction/morphology, and macrobotanical and faunal remains to
explore processing and diet/subsistence issues, the features were considered to have moderate research
value; and,
3) Seven features (F 3, 6, 8 - 10, 13, and 15) were considered to have excellent potential for subsurface
components. Based on the potential to provide radiocarbon samples for dating, technological
information concerning feature construction/morphology, and macrobotanical and faunal remains to
explore processing and diet/subsistence issues, the features were considered to have high research
value.

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

RESEARCH DESIGN
The culture history of the Lower Pecos region reveals that past archeological investigations largely
focused on the development of cultural chronologies utilizing relevant artifact associations. These
investigations have tended to focus on the conspicuous rockshelters containing stratified cultural deposits,
rock art, and well-preserved perishable artifacts; fewer efforts have been made to excavate upland sites.
Previous investigations have been instrumental in the development of regional models and provide a
context for current and future studies. However, the data generated from those studies are often
inadequate to fully address the below research topics for upland sites.
It was anticipated that the feature-focused data recovery would reveal differences in feature form, age,
and function (e.g., What activities occurred at these features? What was being processed? What fuel
wood was utilized? What are the ages of the features and do they provide radiocarbon evidence of
multiple uses?). This data could reveal behavioral patterns linked to the excavated features (e.g., Do the
features represent cooking locales, locations where lithic raw materials were heat-treated, or simply
campfires for warmth?). There is much to learn from the region’s upland sites, which are in distinct
contrast to the spectacular rockshelters and deep terrace sites typically investigated in the Lower Pecos
River region.
Nineteen of the fifty-two features recorded by B&A during the damage assessment survey (Young 2006)
appeared to be intact and/or retain sufficient integrity to provide meaningful association and data. These
were selected for data recovery (see Tables 2 and 3). Because sites 41VV2012 and 2013 were discovered
during construction of the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop project, mechanical disturbances, consisting of
vegetation clearing and deep scarification similar to root plowing (≤ 45.7 cm below ground surface [cm
bs]), disturbed most of the features to varying degrees. Additionally, both sites have been impacted by
erosion and bioturbations over hundreds of years.
Six general research topics guided the data recovery and subsequent analytical efforts for sites 41VV2012
and 41VV2013:

Research Topic #1: Site Formation Processes, Stratigraphy and Integrity
Research Topic #2: Paleoenvironmental Conditions
Research Topic #3: Chronology and Cultural Affiliation
Research Topic #4: Subsistence Resource Procurement and Mobility
Research Topic #5: Lithic Resource Procurement and Technology
Research Topic #6: Site Structure and Spatial Patterns

Research topics were addressed through the analysis of recovered materials and their contexts; specialized
laboratory analyses, such as physical and chemical analyses of various materials, when appropriate, and
limited extramural excavations outside of feature contexts. Since most of the specialized analyses address
multiple research topics, further information on the analyses and the number of samples analyzed is
presented in the methods section of this plan rather than within each individual research topic. Presented
below are the six broad research topics.

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

23

RESEARCH TOPIC #1: SITE FORMATION PROCESSES, STRATIGRAPHY AND
INTEGRITY
The archeological and geoarcheological investigations at 41VV2012 and 2013 were accomplished, when
possible, by correlating cultural features and artifact distribution data with soil stratigraphy and
geomorphological data. Backhoe trench and unit profiles were examined by a professional
geomorphologist to determine the nature of the depositional and post-depositional processes at both sites.
Accelerated Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and bulk sediment radiocarbon dates were collected, as
appropriate to date the accumulation of sediments. Information from other paleoenvironmental samples,
such as pollen and carbon isotope ratios derived from the analysis of radiocarbon assays and bulk
sediment samples, also provided clues to the history of the landform and the sites themselves. The ability
to examine spatially segregated, temporally discrete archeological deposits and/or assemblages is
necessary for intra- and inter-site comparisons; and, in turn, examination of cultural change or continuity
through time. However, the degree and intensity of construction clearing and scarification prevented the
identification of temporally discrete and spatially segregated deposits.
RESEARCH TOPIC #2: PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
Human communities harvested plants and animals and left residues of these in and around the sites they
occupied. Changes in local climate and precipitation levels cause changes in plant and animal
communities; this should be reflected in the archeological and paleoenvironmental records. As
precipitation rates fluctuated during prehistory, variable amounts of available water (e.g., the unnamed
tributaries of San Felipe Creek and San Felipe Creek itself) may have influenced short- or long-term
occupation of a particular site, even though general vegetation communities may have remained relatively
constant.
Climate continuity and change had repercussions for ancient hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence.
Comparison of floral and faunal materials recovered from excavations at both sites could indicate biotic
changes in the region. Paleoenvironmental reconstruction focused on the identification of macrobotanical
remains recovered from the proposed investigations, as well as the analysis of basic soil data. Attempts
were made to determine the pollen record at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 via the recovery of soil samples
from various contexts across the sites.
Recovered feature fill samples were sieved using water flotation and the subsequent recovery of the light
and heavy fractions utilized to identify represented floral and faunal species. Macrobotanical samples
were submitted to Dr. Phil Dering for analysis and reporting. Additionally, sediment and other specialized
samples from backhoe trenches and hand excavated units were subjected to a variety of analysis to
investigate the nature of the environmental setting.
Stable carbon isotope ratios analyzed by the project geomorphologist indicated the ratio of shadeintolerant, warm-season C4 plants to more generalized, cool-season C3 plants in the area. These special
studies were critical to understanding the dynamic nature of paleoenvironment and resultant prehistoric
adaptations through time at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

RESEARCH TOPIC #3: CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL AFFILIATION
A primary goal of data recovery excavations at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 was the recovery of intact
stratified cultural deposits to establish a chronology of human occupation at the sites and to place that
occupation within its regional context. Given the paucity of excavations in the uplands of the Lower
Pecos River region, there is little solid comparative data available to assist B&A in defining relationships
between the occupations at the sites and culture complexes of the overall region. The recovery of
diagnostic cultural materials during the feature-focused excavations was assessed in the context of
chronometric dates obtained from features and sediments at the sites.
It was hoped that data recovery would detect subtle differences in sediments and/or cultural features that
indicate multiple occupations/use and/or discern patterns that reflect discrete and/or overprinted
occupations. In order to isolate such data, multiple samples for chronometric dating were recovered from
across the sites. The contexts of each radiocarbon or bulk humate sample were carefully and
systematically recorded with respect to its horizontal and vertical provenience.
RESEARCH TOPIC #4: SUBSISTENCE RESOURCE PROCUREMENT AND MOBILITY
The process of obtaining food and resources from the surrounding environment was critical to huntergatherer communities who occupied the two sites. These activities greatly influenced when and where
these communities settled and how they organized their lives, forming the basis of the relationships that
existed between ancient hunter-gatherer communities and the ecological context in which they obtained
their resources (Kelly 1995). A consideration of these relationships provides a point of departure for
investigating subsistence remains and interpretation of the corresponding lifeways of the ancient
inhabitants of sites 41VV2012 and 2013 (e.g., Were subsistence pursuits dictating when and where
people aggregated? Was the acquisition of other resources, such as quality lithic material, embedded in
the food quest? Or was the acquisition of other kinds of resources the overarching priority that influenced
the settlement pattern of these communities?).
Because of seasonal shifts in climate and precipitation, there were likely seasonally available resources
exploited by occupants of 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. It is logical that different kinds of food gathering
and hunting techniques were used at different times of the year. In contrast, other potential plant foods
were likely available year round. Understanding seasonal shifts in dietary patterns necessitates the
recovery and analysis of faunal remains as well as carbonized floral remains. This recovery was directly
dependent on the geomorphic integrity of the site, the integrity of individual features, and the preservation
potential of the sedimentary matrix. If floral and faunal remains can be tied to particular features or
occupation areas, identification of these materials is crucial, as is assessing the degree of maturity of any
recovered faunal remains in terms of seasonality data, to explore these issues.
Subsistence patterning can illustrate the degree the prehistoric occupants were intimately familiar with the
local ecology and how this was reflected in the cultural assemblage. In terms of a foraging subsistencesettlement system, the prehistoric groups would have been highly cognizant of when and where particular
resources could be found across the landscape at any given time. This kind of subsistence-settlement
adaptation allowed groups to make full use of all of the resources within a given territory. This would
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

25

have included siliceous materials for chipped-stone tool production in local and adjacent areas. In terms
of sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013, tool-quality raw material in the form of gravels may have originated
from the local creeks (e.g., San Felipe Creek), bedrock outcrops, the adjacent Edwards Plateau, nearby
Rio Grande siliceous gravel deposits, and possibly from the Pecos and Devil’s Rivers.
On the other hand, if a collector subsistence-settlement adaptation predominated, it can be expected that
there was a reliance on the diversity of resources within close proximity to these presumably seasonal
camps. It is thought that seasonal residential camps would have been focused more on specific resources
in the area, such as plants that occur within or near the upland project area. The material technology
would be comprised of tools with specific tasks, such as knives for butchering, or formal scrapers for
plant and animal processing. Specialized tool forms may indicate specific function and/or a narrower
range of food resources.
B&A’s priority here was to determine whether the procurement and exploitation of other key resources
(i.e., lithic raw materials, plant fibers, stone for thermal features) was embedded in the food quest or,
rather, a part of a diverse and shifting set of priorities that focused at specific times on the exploitation of
food resources and at other times, the procurement of other key resources.
RESEARCH TOPIC #5: LITHIC RESOURCE PROCUREMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
The efficient production, maintenance, and use of different kinds of material culture were likely a priority
of the groups utilizing 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. By looking at changes in technology and artifact style,
it was sometimes possible to interpret long term shifts in material production. Moreover, the patterning of
debitage and formal tools provided insight into activity patterns within a particular temporal period.
The distribution of these tools and the debitage left from their production and maintenance provided
insight into past activities. Data recovery and analysis were geared toward documenting continuities and
changes in lithic production and use by implementing a morphological analysis of formal tools, analysis
of the waste produced during their production and maintenance (e.g., debitage), and analysis of the
worked edges of tool forms.
The prehistoric groups that occupied 41VV2012 and 2013 could have obtained lithic raw material from
nearby upland bedrock outcrops from the adjacent Edwards Plateau, nearby Rio Grande siliceous gravel
deposits, and possibly from the Pecos and Devil’s Rivers. As discussed above, B&A’s focus was on the
lithic raw material preference and quantification of the excavated samples. The kinds of raw material used
in the production and maintenance of lithic tool forms provided information concerning the movement of
individuals and groups across the landscape to procure such resources.
RESEARCH TOPIC #6: SITE STRUCTURE AND SPATIAL PATTERNS
The question of site structure focuses on determining whether there are intact cultural deposits and if 1)
they accumulated as part of a synchronous patterning of activities represented by artifacts and debris
present on discrete living surfaces, 2) whether deposits represent multiple secondary deposits indicative of
far fewer occupations over time, or 3) whether occupational sequences shifted through time. It is likely

26

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

that the deposits at the sites represent overprinting and mixing of multiple occupations. Data recovery
excavations attempted to shed light on the depositional history of the archeological deposits, as well as
how post-depositional processes influenced the character of the extant cultural remains.
It is important to determine whether a specific occupational layer is a primary or secondary deposit.
Discrete living surfaces in hunter-gatherer archeological sites are not easily discerned, particularly if a site
has been exposed to long term sheetwash, bioturbation, and repeated episodes of eolian deposition and
deflation. The translocation of cultural material blurs the archeological record, thus, it was imperative to
identify artifacts located in situ so that the translocation of cultural materials could be documented and
understood. A critical aspect of data recovery was to recognize the appearance and contexts of discrete
living surfaces through spatial patterning. For the purposes of this research design, a living surface is
suggested when a number of point-plotted artifacts are found lying flat and at similar or related
elevations, especially when associated within an intact feature.
Precise plotting of individual feature elements, artifacts, and debris in close horizontal proximity to a
particular feature or set of features is critical. In such cases, a living surface may be inferred. To this end,
all tools and features found in situ and, if possible, other artifacts and subsistence remains were precisely
plotted both horizontally and vertically.
The function of sites is linked to the cultural ecological adaptations of the hunter-gatherer communities
who occupied and utilized the sites. If, for example, the sites were utilized as short-term special
use/extractive locales that were repeatedly utilized, intra-site patterning should exhibit a limited range of
activities. Various activities then may be implied by the close proximity of the cultural features (e.g.,
hearths and lithic reduction features) to other cultural debris (i.e., chipped-stone debitage and formal stone
tools). The inter- and intra-site comparison of artifacts in the Drop and Toss Zones may show that
variables in artifact frequency and attributes relate directly to feature use and function.
Useful in assessing the type of settlement is the structure and content of individual features. If the sites
reflect a series of long-term occupations, then abundant and repeatedly used features should be
identifiable. It is hoped that such remains also exhibit preserved subsistence data in the form of
carbonized macro floral and faunal material. The intensity of use of a specific feature within a specific
time period should be discernible. In order to clarify such fine-grained data, multiple radiocarbon dates
from the same feature are needed.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONS
The primary data recovery methods utilized at sites 41VV2012 and 2013 were systematic hand
excavation of targeted features, surface collection of all artifacts adjacent to excavated features, the
recovery of special samples from features that could provide chronometric and macrobotanical
information, analysis of all lithic (e.g., chipped-stone, ground stone, etc.) and ceramic artifacts, as well as
quantification of fire-cracked rock (FCR).
The methodology focused on data recovery of cultural deposits within 16 FCR features, three non-thermal
rock features, and 12 random sample Control Units (CUs) as well as interpreting the project area
geomorphology through the excavation of 21 BHTs. The completed fieldwork generally conformed to the
SOW approved by TxDOT. In-field methodological adjustment and/or departure from the SOW occurred
in consultation with TxDOT and THC as geomorphological and feature excavation data became available.
Deviation consisted of abandonment of mechanical scraping at both sites and the early termination of
excavation at five features (F 9 at site 41VV2012 and F 4, 6, 9, and 11 at 41VV2013); as well as the
excavation of F 18 and F 14 rather than F 10 and F 20 at 41VV2012. The early termination of select
feature excavations was due to a lack of buried components, and poor preservation and integrity.
Data recovery efforts originally proposed the hand excavation of a minimum of 88 excavation units (1 m2
EUs) consisting of four contiguous 1 m2 EUs established at 19 features. Ultimately, due to B&As field
observations, including redundancy of data and poor preservation, TxDOT approved SOW deviations,
resulting in the hand excavation of 75 1 m2 EUs (15.78 m3 of soil) at 18 features, an additional 12 sitewide CUs (3.62 m3 of soil) and the excavation of 21 BHTs (186.90 m3 of sediments) for a total excavation
of 206.3 m3 of sediments.
FIELD TASKS
The initial field procedures involved the establishment of a primary horizontal and vertical control datum
(e.g., the top of a deeply driven rebar) at each site. All data recovery activities were referenced to these
points. Coordinates for each 1 m2 EU derived from its southwest corner, providing provenience for the
feature excavations. Additionally, select lithic tools from disturbed surface contexts were point-plotted
with a sub-meter accurate handheld Global Positioning System (GPS).
B&A assigned coordinates N1000/E1000 to each site’s primary datum; assigning an arbitrary elevation of
100.00 m. Due to the data recovery occurring within an active construction zone (intense dump truck
traffic resulting in constant ground vibration and heavy dust clouds) with limited line of sight issues, an
optimum location for the vertical datum could not be conveniently established. This resulted in a limited
number of elevations located above the arbitrary 100.00 m vertical datum. Secondary datums were
established, as needed, allowing for more convenient TDS mapping of each site. Contour maps were
created using topographic data collected from across each site with the TDS; the raw data was then used
to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in 20 cm intervals.

Geomorphological/Geoarcheological Assessment and Exploratory Backhoe Trenching
Following the establishment of the grids, both sites were subjected to systematic backhoe trenching to
interpret site formation processes and the overall potential for intact cultural deposits at 412VV2012 and
41VV2013. The geoarcheological/geomorphological investigation was conducted by Dr. Stephen Hall;
this data is presented in its entirety in Appendix A. The backhoe trench (BHT) data is presented in
Appendix B.
A total of 21 systematically placed BHTs (#1-21) were excavated and examined for cultural materials and
geomorphic data. The placement of BHTs was selected to confirm the horizontal and vertical extent of the
sites and determine landform development. Three BHTs (#8 – 10) were excavated at site 41VV2012 and
six BHTs (#3 – 5, 19 – 21) were excavated at 41VV2013.
Additional trenching included eleven exploratory BHTs adjacent to 41VV2013: three (# 16 – 18)
immediately north and one (#6) immediately northwest of the site, one (#7) between the two sites (that are
separated by approximately 1,000 m), and seven (#1, 2, and 11 – 15) immediately west of the site and
adjacent to a tributary drainage; to determine whether deeply buried cultural deposits occur and to
confirm the character of a predominantly buried, cumlic A-Horizon paleosol. The 21 BHTs were
documented by B&A personnel and examined by Dr. Hall; however, due to sterile deposits and redundant
data, the eleven exploratory BHTs were not subjected to a detailed analysis.
The backhoe trenches measured approximately 5 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1.5 m deep with some variation.
Following excavations, archeologists troweled at least one wall of each BHT. The archeologists and
geoarcheologist then examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, features, soil anomalies and/or
stratigraphic units. Select profiles were drawn, described and photographed.
Feature Investigations
Drop-Toss Zones
Concurrent with backhoe trenching and geoarcheological/geomorphological investigations, archeologists
collected all surface artifacts within a 3 m radius of the center of the 19 targeted features to assess the
inventory of artifacts encompassed within the theoretical Drop and Toss zones, as per Research Topic No.
4. A crew of two or three archeologists systematically transected the specified area placing pin flags
adjacent to the observed artifacts; provenience data was collected with a TDS and each artifact was then
bagged and catalogued. Thirteen of these collection zones were located in a highly disturbed context,
having recently been subjected to vegetation clearing (bulldozing) and scarification (root plowing) during
preparation of the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW prior to construction. Therefore, it must be noted
that temporal and functional association of these artifacts to specific features is inconclusive.
Excavations
After surface collection, archeologists initiated hand excavations at the 19 selected cultural features. As
per the TxDOT and THC approved data recovery plan, archeologists established a minimum of four
contiguous 1m2 units across each targeted feature. This allowed for a cross-section of each feature and a
sample of the theoretical Drop and Toss zones. Individual 1-x-4-m2 units within a block were designated

30

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Excavation Units (EUs) 1 through 4. Table 4 provides grid coordinates for all excavated units per SW
corner designation. Features were usually cross-sectioned near the juncture of EUs 1 and 2 within each
1x4 m2 block, while EUs 3 and 4 sampled the theoretical Drop and Toss Zones. Once the cross section
line and the four 1m2 units were established, archeologists photographed and prepared scaled plan view
drawings of each targeted feature prior to excavation.

Feature excavations proceeded in arbitrary 10- cm levels. Vertical control was maintained by line levels
referenced to individual unit datums (established on top of the 1 x 4 m block unit stakes). Seventy-five
percent of the soil removed during the excavation of each 1 m2 units was screened through ¼ inch mesh
screen and 25% (typically from the southwest 50-x-50 cm2 quadrant of each 1 m2 unit) was screened
through ⅛ inch mesh screen for enhanced micro-debitage recovery. Excavation depths varied depending
on findings, but all excavations terminated after a minimum of two sterile excavation levels.
Crews removed all FCR from each level during excavations and then size-graded, quantified, and
weighed each specimen as excavations proceeded. The non-excavated parts of features that extended
beyond the associated 1 x 4-m block was termed “Feature Remnant” and was similarly excavated,
weighed, and tabulated (in order to provide a total quantification of the FCR for the entire feature.
Archeologists discarded all FCR in the field.
If preliminary excavation of a feature indicated that the feature was surficial and possessed no meaningful
subsurface component(s), then the remainder of the feature was not excavated, as per discussions with
32

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

TxDOT and THC. Excavation of features was accomplished with a trowel and brush in an attempt to
identify intact deposits, possible living surfaces, and/or buried feature components. Upon the completion
of each feature excavation, select unit walls were photographed and scaled feature profiles were drawn.
Field documentation included the use of standardized level forms, feature forms, stratigraphic profile
forms, and photographic logs. Description of the FCR features followed the terminology offered by
Collins (1991) and Black et al. (1997, Volume II) to systematically and consistently describe components
of the thermal features. This includes terminology for constituent feature stones (e.g., coarse matrix) and
feature fill (e.g., fine matrix). Consistent recording of the count, weight (kilograms), size grade, and
lithology (e.g., angular, sub-angular, etc.); utilizing these standardized terms facilitate inter- and intra-site
comparisons of the 19 targeted features.
Random Stratified Sampling
In addition to feature-focused excavation blocks, six 1m2 CUs were excavated in non-feature areas at both
41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The results provided samples for comparison with feature and the theoretical
Drop and Toss Zones assemblages. Given that both site areas exhibit sloping topography, the sites were
randomly stratified into Upper, Middle and, Lower topographic zones. With this information, CU
placement was accomplished utilizing Hawth’s Analysis Tools for ArcGIS using the Generate Random
Points Tool. The CUs were designated A through F. As with the feature excavations, 75% of soil
removed during the excavation was screened through ¼ inch mesh screen and 25% through fine (⅛ inch)
mesh screen.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
During feature excavations, archeologists collected charcoal samples, as available, for radiocarbon dating.
Following an evaluation of the context and integrity of the samples, B&A submitted four samples from
41VV2012 (Beta 292960 through Beta 292963) and 16 samples from 41VV2013 (Beta 292964 through
Beta 292979) to Beta Analytic, Inc for AMS processing (Appendix C). As Appendix C indicates, there
are multiple 2-Sigma calibrated date ranges for a number of the radiocarbon assays. B&A utilized CALIB
6.0.1 (using the INTCAL09 curve) (Reimer et al. 2004; Stuvier and Reimer 1993) to determine 2-Sigma
calibrated calendar ages for Beta’s conventional radiocarbon ages that, in terms of probabilities, provide
the statistically most viable (e.g., highest Relative Area Under Distribution) age spans for the radiocarbon
samples.
Soil
Soil samples collected through data recovery efforts consisted of bulk samples removed from backhoe
trenches by the project geomorphologist for humate dating and sediment textural and chemical analyses.
When available, a minimum of one liter of feature matrix was collected from each feature for special
analyses (e.g., flotation samples for macrobotanical recovery or pollen analysis). In all, archeologists
collected a total of 10 liters of feature matrix from 41VV2012 and 23 liters from 41VV2013. Ultimately,
ten feature matrix samples and seven charcoal samples were collected from 41VV2012 and 23 feature
matrix samples and 37 charcoal samples were collected from 41VV2013.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

33

Macrobotanical Analysis
From the above inventory, B&A submitted a total of 19 feature matrix samples to Dr. Phil Dering of
Shumla Archeobotanical Services in Comstock, Texas for flotation and macrobotanical analyses.
Additionally, Dr. Dering received 15 charcoal samples for wood identification analysis; Dr. Dering’s
complete results are available in Appendix D.
Pollen Analysis
B&A submitted six soil samples to Dr. Vaughn Bryant at the Texas A&M Palynology Laboratory,
College Station, Texas. The samples were taken from four feature matrix collections and two backhoe
trench soil samples collected within the buried cumlic A-horizon paleosol from site 41VV2013. Given the
open site conditions and the arid environment of the project area, pollen preservation was anticipated to
be poor to non-existent. Initially, Dr. Bryant determined the presence/absence of pollen within these six
samples and three of the six samples “appeared to have sufficient pollen for counting.” Unfortunately, the
pollen was in poor condition and represented only the most durable pollen types typically identifiable in
highly degraded samples. Dr. Bryant’s complete report is presented as Appendix E.
Ceramic Analysis
The six ceramic sherds recovered from 41VV2013 were visually and microscopically analyzed by Dr.
David Robinson, (Austin, Texas); the results are available in Appendix F.
LABORATORY ANALYSIS
A field catalog was utilized to document all excavated materials by excavation level, as well as the point
plotted artifacts and samples (such as radiocarbon, flotation, and soil). Individual EU level bags were
labeled in the field with regard to provenience and material recovered.
Processing and subsequent analysis of recovered cultural materials was conducted at the archeological
laboratory at B&A. Initial sorting, cataloguing, and analyses was conducted on chipped-stone tools and
debitage, ground stone implements, faunal remains, and feature matrix. All collected artifacts and special
samples, as well as the project records and photographs will be curated at the CAR (The University of
Texas at San Antonio). All materials were prepared in accordance with their Standards and Guidelines for
the Preparation of Archeological Collections, Records, and Photographs (n.d.).
Lithic Analysis
B&A staff conducted a technological analysis of all chipped-stone tools and debitage recovered during
data recovery. Analysis included the documentation of metric attributes, completeness/portion, material
type, presence/absence of cortex, and presence/absence of thermal alteration. Debitage analysis included
the documentation of platform characteristics (e.g., single facet, multifacet, ground, cortex, or crushed) to
gain insight into the reduction strategy.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Chipped-Stone Taxonomy
Bifaces are objective pieces that have been flaked on both sides to form a single edge that circumscribes
the entire artifact (Andrefsky 2001) resulting in an artifacts which “bear[s] flake scars on both faces”
(Crabtree 1972). Artifacts within this category fall within the reduction trajectory for formal tool
production, but cannot be confidently assigned to a particular function or other tool type. B&A followed
Goode’s (2002:36) model of biface reduction consisting of four reduction stages defined as Stages I
through IV of his “Process C Reduction Model.” Stage I includes initial decertification and thinning of
the objective piece using hard hammer percussion. Stage II involves secondary thinning and initial
shaping through hard and medium percussion and may include some indirect percussion. Stage III is the
final stage of thinning and major shaping using medium and small percussion with some initial pressure
flaking likely. Stage IV involves the final shaping of a biface using pressure tools (Goode 2002:36).
Blades are specialized flakes that are commonly twice as long as they are wide (Crabtree 1972). These are
generally produced from carefully prepared blade cores from which blades have been removed
sequentially. The reduction of the blade cores leaves remnant scars that typically traveled the length of the
core, often giving it a prismatic cross section. Blades were often used as cutting edges.
Choppers are tools used for intensive cutting/chopping activities. Despite being a tool with a specific
function, choppers can also act as multifunctional tools, serving as cores for flake removals prior to
achieving their final form. Because choppers are manufactured to be handheld, many specimens retain a
cortex “backing,” presumably to improve the user’s grip on the tool.
Cores represent raw material nuclei (objective piece) from which flake (or blade) tools and flake blanks
for producing tools are extracted. Artifacts in this class often have a blocky or angular form and can be
considered the by-product of flake production (Black 1986:50). Cores may occur in a variety of forms,
including bifacial, unifacial, and multidirectional. Flake removal is influenced by the morphology and
physical properties of the raw material.
Debitage is the residual material that results from lithic tool manufacture (Crabtree 1972).
Unmodified Debitage is waste debris generated by lithic reduction. Unmodified debitage has not been
modified and/or used following its removal from the objective piece.
Utilized Debitage are expedient tools that exhibit random step fractures, gloss/polish, and/or other
use-wear along their lateral margins due to use rather than intentional modification, such as patterned
flake removal. Utilized debitage specimens lack preparation prior to use.
Edge-modified debitage, as the name suggests, are intentionally modified debitage for producing
expedient tools. Tools of this nature are often expediently manufactured and exhibit intentional
modification by direct percussion or pressure. This category of tool also includes trimmed/retouched
flakes.
Groundstone artifacts are lithic artifacts smoothed by cultural abrasion, polish, impact, and/or grinding
(Adams 2002:1). Two classes of groundstone, manos and metates, were documented during the current
project. Manos (smoothed and rounded hand-held stones used for grinding) in conjunction with a metate
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

35

(flat stones ground smooth and used as a grinding surface) were used to process plants, nuts, minerals,
and other materials.
Formal tools (i.e., scrapers, drills, knives, etc.) consistently exhibit a standardized form. Formal tools are
not necessarily diagnostic tools although they are generally manufactured and used for specific functions.
Diagnostic tools are formal tools (i.e., projectile points) with known cultural and temporal
affiliations.
Expedient tools are modified or unmodified pieces of chipped stone, often considered to be
expediently manufactured and intended to be discarded after use.
Perforators are formal tools used for puncturing/piercing leather, wood, and other materials. Often,
drills are manufactured from broken and/or reworked projectile points although they are also
commonly made on marginally worked flakes (Black 1986:72).
Unifaces are tools that have been modified on one side via direct percussion or pressure flaking. Such
tools are often manufactured from flake blanks. Unifacial artifacts may be a specific type (e.g., Clear
Fork uniface) or, more commonly, a scraper manufactured from a flake that may exhibit working
surfaces along one or more edges.
Projectile point is the inclusive term for arrow points and dart points. Projectile points are the most
common prehistoric diagnostic artifact; most are bifacially flaked with a thinned and pointed distal tip and
modifications for hafting.
Low-powered Light Assisted Microscopic Lithic Use-wear Analysis
Low-powered (40-200X magnification), light assisted microscopy was performed for a select sample of
artifacts from sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 to determine if use-wear was evident in the chipped stone
and groundstone tool assemblage and, if observed, qualify the type and degree of that use-wear. The use
of low powered microscopy has been shown to be a reliable for documenting edge damage (Bamforth
1988; Odell and Odell-Vereecken 1980) and the identification of polishes (Keeley 1980; Semenov 1964)
although less reliable in the identification of use-wear striations and causes of polish (i.e., whether an
observed polish is derived from working hide, meat, plants, etc.).
Minimum Analytical Nodule Analysis
A Minimum Analytical Nodule Analysis (MANA) was performed on the lithic materials collected from
Locus A on site 41VV2013 to gather information regarding behavior as it pertains to lithic technology.
Developed by Larson and Kornfeld (1997), MANA involved sorting the lithic assemblage into groups and
subgroups on the basis of raw material characteristics such as color, texture, luster, translucency,
inclusions, cortex, thermal modification, and fluorescence (Larson 1994:58; Larson and Ingbar
1992:154). The division process allowed researchers to identify groups of lithic specimens that may have
been derived from the same parent piece/nodule. These individual groupings of specimens are termed
minimum analytical nodules (MANs).

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

STRATIGRAPHY
Both 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 are upland sites occupying nearly level to gently sloping bench-like hill
side locales. In this upland environment, the geomorphology and geology (Cretaceous, late Quaternary
and Holocene) consists of thin deposits of silty and clayey colluvium and thin localized silty and clayey
alluvium overlying the weathered/eroded Upper Cretaceous Del Rio Clay. During data recovery,
researchers identified an A horizon that is exposed at the ground surface or in areas shallowly buried by
colluvial sediment, an eolian veneer or localized wedges of alluvium. The cultural deposits occur on the
surface of the paleosol, though some cultural features are intrusive into the A horizon; no artifacts were
discovered buried within the A horizon.
The formal geomorphological/geoarcheological assessment for data recovery was conducted by Dr.
Stephen Hall of Red Rock Geological Enterprises, Santa Fe, New Mexico (see Appendix A). Dr. Hall
concentrated his efforts on defining surface sediments (and their approximate ages) associated with each
site. The geomorphological study identified six geomorphic-stratigraphic units typically found at both
sites that generally correlate with natural zones delineated by archeologists during data recovery. Dr.
Hall’s stratigraphic units, from youngest to oldest, are Units I through VI, with Units II and IV restricted
to localized deposits at 41VV2013 and 41VV2012, respectively. Zone-Unit correlations are as follows:
Zone I ........................ Unit I (silt eolian veneer)
No zone equivalent .... Unit II (post-paleosol alluvium only observed in the cutbank profile of the
drainage on 41VV2013)
Zone II ....................... .Unit III (A horizon paleosol)
Zone III/IIIa ............... Unit IV (alluvial gravel) and Unit V (colluvial gravel)
Zone IV...................... .Unit VI (Del Rio Clay)
The primary differences among the zone-unit correlations are that Unit II was not observed in
archeological excavations, while Dr. Hall’s Units IV and V were conflated in the field by archeologists to
a single gravel zone designated Zone III/IIIa. Zone III/IIIa consists of pre-paleosol alluvial and colluvial
gravels; subzone IIIa indicates a denser proportion of gravel (30% by volume) compared to 90% by
volume in the lower sub-zone. Unit II (no Zone equivalent) was restricted to the cutbank profile of the
unnamed drainage adjacent to BHT 1 at the base of the hillslope on the south end of 41VV2013. Unit IV
was only exposed on 41VV2012 in BHT 8 and BHT 10 near the narrow unnamed drainage at the foot of
the hill slope, and adjacent to BHT 1 on 41VV2013 within the cutbank of the drainage. Based on the
above data, Units II and IV are restricted to the streams of both sites; the remainders of both sites are
upslope from the drainage and contained no exposures of those strata.
Following are descriptions of the archeologist-defined stratigraphic zones encountered during data
recovery at both sites. Zone descriptions and scaled profiles of the trench walls were completed in the
field during excavations (Appendix B). Due to the redundancy of the site stratigraphy on 41VV2012 and

41VV2013, exploratory archeological BHTs 11 - 21 AT 41VV2013 were not individually described,
though each was inspected by Dr. Hall.
Zone I is an eolian silt veneer that is undated; it is light brown to yellowish brown with a loose to friable
structure, common rootlets (1 millimeter) and some gravels. Its maximum thickness is 10 cm.
Zone I was observed in BHTs 9 and 10, F 18 and 19, and Control Unit D on 41VV2012 and in BHTs 1 7 and 11 - 19 on or adjacent to 41VV2013. Zone I contained cultural materials at both sites: FCR features,
lithic artifacts including but not limited to Perdiz, Ensor, Frio, Figureoa, Almagre, and untyped
expanding stem projectile points.
Zone II is a clayey silt A horizon paleosol formed ca. 3,200 to 800 BP (based on bulk sediment
radiocarbon dates—see Appendix A). It is exposed at the surface in areas where eolian sediments eroded
away at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. It has a maximum thickness of 80 cm as observed in the cutbank of
the unnamed drainage on the southeast edge of 41VV2013; however, it thins rapidly as one moves
upslope. It ranges from dark grayish-brown (10YR 4/2) to brown (10YR 4/3) and small limestone gravels
are uncommon, as are calcium carbonate flecks and filaments.
Zone II was observed in BHT 10 at 41VV2012 and BHTs 1 - 6, 11 - 15, and 19 - 21 at 41VV2013. In
many areas, cultural material rests on the surface of the paleosol and several features are intrusive into the
stratum but it contains no artifacts. Its lower boundary with Zone III/IIIa in BHT 10 at 41VV2012 is clear
and wavy; yet, in BHT 1 at 41VV2013 it is abrupt and wavy, and its lower boundary with Zone V in BHTs
2, 5, and 6 at 41VV2013 is clear and wavy.
Zones III/IIIa consists of gravels (pebble to boulder size limestone and some minor amounts of siltstone)
derived from the nearby Buda Limestone that is located on adjacent upland ridges with a yellowish-brown
(10YR 5/4) to light yellowish-brown (10YR 6/4) gravel/sand/silt/clay matrix. The maximum thickness is
between 60 and 70 cm as observed in BHT 1 at 41VV2013. It is poorly sorted and consists of
approximately 30% to 40% gravel by volume. Zones III/IIIa were observed in BHTs 8 - 10, F 13, 14, and
17 - 19, and Control Units A - F at 41VV2012; as well as in BHTs 1, 2, and 13 - 17 at 41VV2013. Most
features and some artifacts occur on the surface and/or are intrusive into this deposit.
Zone IV is comprised of Del Rio Clay (Cretaceous) which is very pale brown (10YR 7/4) clayey silt,
calcareous, hard and blocky with stage II carbonate morphology at top and high calcium carbonate content
throughout the remainder of exposure. Inclusions include siltstone and pelecypods (e.g., Exogyra arietina).
It was observed in BHTs 8 and 9, as well as Control Unit E at 41VV2012 and in BHTs 1 - 7 and 16 - 21 at
41VV2013. The lower boundary of Zone IV was not reached during the geomorphological/
geoarcheological investigations.

RESULTS OF EXCAVATION
After the initial 2010 discovery of cultural resources within the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW,
B&A conducted a post-review survey of the impacted project area documenting 41VV2012 and
41VV2013. Fifty-two prehistoric thermal and non-thermal rock features were discovered and documented
within these two sites. Site 41VV2012 contained 20 thermal and non-thermal rock features; while site
41VV2013 contained 32 discrete thermal rock features. As part of the feature recording process, B&A
ranked the features in terms of their perceived research value based on the degree/percentage of
intactness, potential for subsurface components, and presence/absence of ashy matrix and/or charcoal
(Young 2010).
This chapter provides the results of the excavations; the discussion proceeds by site and includes an
overview of pertinent site and feature data followed by a summary of site stratigraphy. This is followed
with a thorough description of each excavated feature and addresses feature construction/morphology,
content, and integrity as well as the quality and quantity of FCR. All artifacts recovered from 41VV2012
and 41VV2013 are tabulated in Appendix G. A summary of special samples obtained from the features,
including charcoal samples for radiocarbon dates and feature matrix for flotation and macrobotanical
analysis, follows. Each feature discussion ends with summary and concluding remarks. In addition to the
feature focused excavations, 1 m2 CUs were used to sample various topographic elevations across each
site; those excavation results follow the feature discussions.
SITE 41VV2012
The mitigation plan for 41VV2012 focused on five cultural features (F 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19). Features
14 and 17 are burned rock concentrations, Features 13 and 19 are unburned slab alignments, and Feature
18 is a unique combination of thermal and non-thermal sandstone slabs; all five features were surficial or
shallowly buried (Figure 6). These features are individually described below with integrated radiocarbon
and feature sample data, which is also presented in tables. Surficial artifacts were absent in the Drop and
Toss Zones highlighting the pronounced lack of artifacts at 41VV2012.
Feature Descriptions
Feature 13
Feature 13 was a 225 x 300-cm ovate cluster of approximately 10 unburned tabular sandstone slabs
oriented on a roughly north-south axis (Figure 7). The slabs on an average measure approximately 25 x
25 x 3 cm with the largest stone measuring 25 x 45 x 3 cm. The raw material is yellowish brown
sandstone with a dark gray patina. Variations in slab coloration suggest that some slabs may have
previously overlapped one another or were once partially buried. At the time of excavation, however, all
of the slabs were surficial and separated by a distance of at least 10 to 15 cm. None of the sandstone slabs
display evidence of smoothing, grinding, or thermal alteration.
A 1 x 4 m excavation block was positioned to bisect F 13 along a north-south axis with EU 2 best
positioned to provide a cross section profile. As excavations proceeded, three additional unburned
sandstone slabs were exposed in EU 1 (L 1, 99.00-99.10 m) beneath a 3-cm veneer of Zone I eolian silt.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

These slabs most likely represent a single fragmented slab. The remaining slabs discovered in EUs 1, 2,
and 3, as well as those located outside of the 1 x 4 m block, occurred within the Zone I eolian silt resting
atop sterile Zone III colluvial gravels.
Similarities in patina, size, and the obvious clustering of the slabs suggest that they likely represent
prehistoric cultural manuports placed together for a specific purpose. This patterning of unburned
sandstone slabs with similar morphologies was also observed in F 18, F 19 and F 20. Although additional
sandstone slabs occur naturally on the surface of the site, as well as in the profile of BHT 9 (see
Appendix B), none exhibit natural clustering.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
The excavation of Feature 13 and the 1 x 4-m excavation block (block) resulted in the documentation of
only one burned limestone rock (EU 1, Level (L) 1, 99.07 m) in the 3–10-cm size category and weighing
0.2 kg (Table 5).
Artifacts
Subsurface Materials
The excavation of Feature 13 and the adjacent 1 x 4 m block recovered no buried artifacts, other than the
single FCR discussed above (Table 6).
Drop and Toss Zone Materials
The Drop and Toss Zones contained no cultural materials.
Special Samples
Feature 13 contained no charcoal or carbonaceous feature matrix.
Concluding Remarks
The absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts in Feature 13 and the lack of charcoal preclude a
determination of feature age. The spatial relationship of the mostly surficially exposed sandstone slabs
suggests intentional placement, possibly for use as a platform for food preparation or other activity. This
hypothesis is supported by the central location of the feature in relationship to nearby thermal features: F11, 12, 14, and 15 (see Figure 6). The feature may, alternatively, be interpreted as part of a structure,
perhaps a wickiup, although the slabs seem to lack sufficient size and weight.
Feature 14
Feature 14 was a small somewhat circular hearth with an associated scatter of FCR. The embedded core
of the feature contained an ashy matrix topped with approximately 15 large burned fossiliferous sandstone
rocks measuring 65 x 70 cm with an approximate NW/SE axis (Figures 8 and 9). The constituent FCR,
angular to rounded in shape, average 10 to 12 cm in diameter, with larger FCR measuring 15 to 18 cm in
diameter (see Table 5). Characteristics of constituent stones include in-situ cracking of FCR and a grayish
brown ashy stain which extended approximately 10 cm beyond the observed perimeter of the feature core.

The associated FCR scatter primarily extended 1.75 m eastward and down slope from the feature core.
The surface scatter contained approximately 100 fire-cracked fossiliferous sandstone fragments averaging
8 x 10 cm in size. Gravel to cobble sized rocks within the scatter displayed various levels of thermal
discoloration ranging from red and reddish gray (indicative of intensive heat exposure) to yellow and light
gray (indicative of less intensive heat exposure).
Approximately 50% of the core feature was located north of the 1 x 4 m excavation block; upon
completion of the block excavation, the remaining feature (Feature Remnant) was removed to quantify
the total weight of FCR.
The north wall feature profile in EU 3 revealed a 10 cm thick (99.06-98.96 m) deposit of grayish-brown
(10YR5/2) ashy feature matrix within a poorly defined shallow basin-like depression with diffuse
horizontal and vertical boundaries. The surrounding and underlying sterile soils of Zone III consist of a
yellowish-brown (10YR5/6) friable to firm silty clay loam containing approximately 30% gravel by
volume (Figures 10 and 11). The FCR was horizontally layered over the feature fill but nearly absent
from the subsurface feature matrix. Based on Black et al. (1997:160), this feature can best be described as
a “flat tight/compact cluster” which was arranged on a flat surface with rocks contiguous, layered, and
overlapping.

Excavation Recovery—FCR
The excavation of the southern half of Feature 14 resulted in the recording of 135 pieces of FCR with the
majority (76.6%) measuring 3 - 10 cm in overall size (see Table 5). The FCR weighed 24.6 kg and, of
this, the vast majority (19.3 kg) was documented in EU 3, Ls 3 and 4 (99.06-99.00 and 99.00-98.90 m,
respectively). Level 3 contained 107 FCR weighing 13.6 kg and L 4 yielded 28 FCR weighing 5.7 kg.
Upon completion of the 1 x 4 m excavation block, the remaining northern half of F 14 (Feature Remnant)
was removed to weigh and quantify the remaining FCR. A total of approximately 65 FCR, weighing
25.2 kg, were documented within the feature remnant. The overall FCR count and weight for Feature 14
is 297 specimens weighing 49.8 kg.
Artifacts
Artifact recovery during the excavation of Feature 14 consisted of a single utilized secondary chert flake
(Specimen 1.D1) recovered in EU 2 (L 2, 99.20-99.10 m) (see Table 6). This artifact exhibits random
micro-flaking scars (nibbling) along one lateral edge, likely the result of cutting or slicing.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
A total of four charcoal samples (Lots 8–10) were collected from the feature matrix. Of these, Lots 8 and
10 were submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc. for AMS dating. The Lot 8 sample (Beta 292960) provided a
date of AD 1393–1443 and the Lot 10 sample (Beta 292961) provided a date of AD 1398–1448. The
samples were collected from the base of F 14 (Lot 8) or immediately adjacent to it (Lot 10) (Table 7 and
see Appendix C). These samples yielded extraordinarily tight date ranges that securely date Feature 14 to
the Late Prehistoric.

Flotation/Macrobotanical
A total of four feature matrix samples (Lots 5, 6, 7 and 10) were collected from various parts of Feature
14. Of these, Lots 5 and 6 were submitted for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. These two samples
were taken from near the feature’s base at approximately 98.97 and 98.95 m and both were negative for
botanical food remains. However, the analysis identified mesquite/acacia wood fragments in both
samples, likely representing utilized fuel wood. One additional piece of charcoal from Lot 10 was also
identified as mesquite/acacia (see Appendix D, Table 3).
Concluding Remarks
This relatively intact, but shallow hearth and associated fire-cracked rock scatter dates to the Late
Prehistoric period (ca. AD 1393–1448) and is regionally associated with the Flecha subperiod. It
contained in-situ FCR layered over an ashy matrix contained in a shallow basin. Based on the total weight
of the constituent fire-cracked rocks which were tightly clustered, it is likely this thermal feature was used
for cooking, rather than warmth. The tightly clustered fire-cracked rock could have functioned as a
broiling or roasting bed for foodstuffs positioned directly on a bed of hot coals, then topped with hot
rocks creating an enclosed environment and cooked from multiple sides/directions (Black et al. 1997-69).

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Feature 17
Feature 17 was a slab-lined basin with a convex burned rock cap that is interpreted as an earth oven. The
surface dimensions of the feature core measured 65 x 55 cm and an associated FCR scatter roughly
measured 200 x 155 cm. The basin was lined with thin sandstone slabs (2 cm thick) topped with a dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) ashy matrix with FCR and charcoal flecks and capped with a moderate amount
of angular burned limestone cobbles. The base of F 17 was moderately bioturbated and exhibited a diffuse
rounded to flat boundary extending into the culturally sterile, gravelly and pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2)
colluvial clay with 30% pea gravel (Zone III).
The location of the 1 x 4 m excavation block (EUs 1-4) was selected to bisect F 17 on a north/south axis
along the east wall of EU 2. The excavation of EU 2, L 2 (98.60 – 98.50 m) exposed a sub-circular to
ovate dark colored stain. The east wall profile of EU 2 provided a cross-section of the eastern third of F
17 exposing a 1.15 m wide x 19 cm deep (98.59– 98.40 m) dark-stained basin with cobbles of limestone
FCR and burned tabular sandstone rocks (Figures 12 and 13).
Contrary to the initial determination, the in-situ feature core (19 cm deep basin of dark gray ashy matrix
with charcoal stains and FCR) was discovered approximately 50 cm west of its presumed center along the
east wall of EU 2 (Figure 14). The removal of L 2 and 3 (98.60-98.40 m) at EU 2 revealed 2-cm thick
sandstone slabs tilted downward at approximately 45° along the outer edges of the central basin. The
slabs exhibit heat oxidation (e.g., discolored red to gray) and their arrangement was clearly for the
purpose of holding a fire and/or hot coals while increasing heat retention. Within the slabs was the dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) ashy matrix mixed with FCR and charcoal flecks and capped with a moderate
amount of angular burned limestone cobbles.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
As depicted in the feature profile and L 2 plan view map (see Figures 13 and 14), EU 2 contained the
majority of the feature with some FCR extending into EU 1 (10.8 kg) and lesser amounts (7.3 kg) of FCR
in EU 3; EU 4 was sterile for cultural materials. The majority of the FCR in EUs 2 and 3 was recovered in
L 3 (98.50-98.40 m) although both also contained limited FCR in L 4. Fire cracked rock was scattered
around the feature core and, in all probability, represents the clean out from repeated use of the feature.
Excavation EU 2, containing the majority of F 17, was excavated in three levels (L 2, 3 and 4 [98.60–
98.30 m]). As the feature was exposed, some soils were left in place to preserve the form of the feature
and construction morphology before its removal. This allowed for accurate illustration and photography
of the feature. Unfortunately, due to the pedestaling of the feature, excavators mistakenly weighed the
FCR in L 2, 3 and 4 in bulk and not by level. As such, about 75 FCR weighing 24.0 kg was documented
for all of EU 2 (see Table 5).
The total combined FCR weight from EUs 1, 2 and 3 is 42.1 kg (10.8 kg in EU 1, 24.0 kg in EU 2, and
7.3 kg in EU 3). The FCR from EUs 1 and 3 is considered to be clean out debris from repeated use of the
core feature. Removal and quantification of the portion of F 17 located beyond the 1 x 4 m excavation
block (feature remnant), yielded an additional 21.8 kg of primarily large (10–20 cm) burned sandstone
slabs and limestone cobbles. Overall, Feature 17 contained 147 FCR specimens weighing 63.9 kg.

Artifacts
The artifact assemblage from F 17 consists of one utilized fine-grained limestone tertiary flake
(Specimen 2.D2) and five pieces of shatter (Specimen 2.D1) of similar limestone from EU 2, L 2 (98.60–
98.50 m), as well as one unmodified chert primary flake (Specimen 3.D3) from EU 3, L 3 (98.50-98.40
m) (see Table 6.). The presence of utilized limestone is unique; the relatively large size (4 x 5 cm) of the
utilized limestone flake suggests that the artifact represents a hand-held cutting implement directly
associated with activities around Feature 17.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
Three charcoal samples (Lots 4, 14, and 20) were collected during the excavation of the feature core.
Based on reliable contexts, Lots 14 (Beta 292962) and 20 (Beta 292963) were submitted for AMS
processing. Beta 292962 came from the center of the feature core in EU 2, L 3 (98.50–98.40 m); the other
(Beta 292963) came from the feature base in EU 2, L 4 (98.40–98.30 m). The samples yielded 2-sigma
calibrated date ranges of AD 1391 to AD 1440 (Beta 292962) and AD 1301 to AD 1367 (Beta 292963)
(see Table 7). The radiocarbon assays date the use of Feature 17 to the Flecha subperiod (ca. AD 630–
AD 1500) of the Late Prehistoric, which is concurrent with the Toyah Horizon of the Central Texas and
South Texas Plains archeological regions.
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Six feature matrix samples (Lots 11–13 and 17–19) for flotation and two macrobotanical samples for
wood identification (Lots 4 and 14) were collected. Analysis of two matrix samples, Lots 18 and 19, by
Dr. Dering, indicates that mesquite-acacia wood was used as a fuel source; the samples lacked any
evidence of plant foods (see Appendix D). The two macrobotanical samples were identified as mesquiteacacia wood charcoal (Lot 14) and oak wood charcoal (Lot 4). The presence of hard woods capable of
producing hot, long burning coals supports the interpretation of Feature 17 as an earth oven. No oak trees
were observed within the immediate study area during data recovery, though oak trees grow in the
riparian zone along San Felipe Creek and extend to the adjacent hill slopes.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 17 was an ash and FCR filled slab-lined basin interpreted as a small earth oven. Radiocarbon
dated to AD 1301–AD 1440, this feature occurs within the Late Prehistoric time period and regionally
within the Flecha Subperiod. Flotation and macrobotanical analysis results indicate that mesquite/acacia
and oak were utilized as fuel woods but lack evidence of charred plant food remains. Constructed of thin
sandstone slabs intentionally positioned at oblique angles along the side walls of a wide yet shallow basin,
Feature 17 was filled with layered sandstone slabs and limestone cobbles and capped by a surficial layer
of large 15-20 cm diameter cobbles and slabs.
Based on experimental earth oven research, conducted by Dr. Dering (Dering 1999: 664 – 666), using
comparable construction and fuel materials, a 1.5 m pit “requires about 224 kg of fuel wood to heat a rock
element weighing about 250 kg” (1999: 665). The caloric yield of such an oven loaded with lechuguilla
was calculated to be about 7,600 kg or “about five person-days of food” (1999:666). As previously stated,
Feature 17 yielded a total FCR weight of approximately 63.9 kg indicating that it is small for an earth

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

55

oven. However, it is likely that this basin was repeatedly used to bake foodstuffs such as root and/or
tubers for extended periods in order to break down the material into a digestible state.
Feature 18
Feature 18 was a surficial ovoid cluster of approximately 20 burned and unburned sandstone slabs
(Figure 15). The core feature measured 125 x 130 cm with a southwest to northeast orientation.
Constituent stones averaged approximately 12 x 15 x 3 cm in size with the largest stone measuring
approximately 20 x 20 x 3 cm. Approximately half of the slabs are burned and separated by distances of
approximately 10 cm with little to no overlap.
A 1 x 4 m excavation block (EU 1 – 4) was situated to cross-section the feature along a north-south axis
with the east wall of EU 2 bisecting the presumed feature core. Excavation of a single 10 cm level
revealed that no subsurface cultural deposits exist within EUs 1, 3, and 4. Excavation of these units was
terminated within the culturally sterile archeological Zone III that overlays the weathered Del Rio clay
(Zone IV).
Excavation Recovery—FCR
Excavation Unit 2 was excavated in two levels (L 1 from 98.66–98.60 m and L 2 from 98.60–98.50 m)
and contained low volumes of FCR in L 1; Level 2 was negative for FCR (see Table 5). A total of 23
FCR specimens weighing 7.1 kg was recovered from the feature core located in EU 2; L 1 contained 16
burned sandstone rocks 3–10 cm in size and seven burned sandstone rocks in the 10–15 cm in size range.
The Feature Remnant, located outside and east of the 1 x 4 m excavation block, yielded 26 FCR weighing
5.7 kg. F 18 therefore contained a total count of 49 burned rocks weighing 12.8 kg.
Artifacts
The excavation of F 18 resulted in the recovery of one utilized flake (Specimen 21.D1) at 98.55 m within
L 2 in the southeast quadrant of the EU 2 (see Table 6). Specimen 21.D1 is a small (2.2 x 3.6 cm) chert
secondary flake exhibiting heavy use-wear along one lateral edge. The use-wear is interpreted as result of
intensive cutting or slicing activities directly associated with Feature 18.
Special Samples
Feature 18 contained no feature matrix.
Concluding Remarks
Site 41VV2012 was known to contain three somewhat similar and undated slab alignments (F 13, 19,
and 20) which lacked evidence of thermal alteration. After full exposure of the plan view, it was
determined that Feature 18 was more similar to the unburned sandstone slab alignments than a thermal
feature. Initially, Feature 18 was interpreted as an open centered hearth and was not recommended for
further investigations. Given that the feature exhibited burned and unburned stones suggesting the feature
may have retained datable materials, a decision was made during fieldwork to mitigate the feature.
Unfortunately, the results of excavation were inconclusive, though the data lends support that these fairly
lightweight and thin slabs may have been a type of food preparation platform functionally associated with
nearby thermal Features 12, 16, and 17.

Feature 19
Feature 19 is a roughly ovoid surficial arrangement of unburned sandstone slabs measuring 1.20 x 1.75 m
with a north to south orientation. The majority of constituent stones were separated by approximately 15
cm although three slabs overlapped one another along the southwest edge of the feature (Figure 16). The
center of the alignment was open and appears to have been cleared of detritus. The sandstone slabs are
yellowish-brown in color with a dark gray patina. Other slabs with distinct non-patinated surfaces are
suggestive of possible overlapping in the past (Figure 17). The average slab size measures approximately
25 x 25 x 3 cm with the largest measuring 47 x 40 x 3 cm.
Feature 19 was bisected by the 1 x 4 m excavation block, with EUs 2 and 3 providing a cross-section. The
units were excavated between two and three levels (99.42 to 99.20 m) and contained no cultural materials.
All units were terminated in yellowish-brown colluvial gravels (Zone III).
Excavation Recovery—FCR
Feature 19 contained no burned and/or fire-cracked rocks.
Artifacts
The excavation of Feature 19 recovered no artifacts.
Special Samples
No carbonaceous feature matrix was encountered during the excavation of Feature 19 and, therefore, no
samples were submitted for flotation and macrobotanical analyses.
Concluding Remarks
Based on its physical association with adjacent thermal Features 14 (hearth) and 17 (earth oven), it is
hypothesized that Feature 19 and the thermal features are contemporaneous and functionally associated.
The patination patterns on select slabs coupled with several overlapping slabs is suggestive of a
pavement-like slab arrangement. It is proposed that the slab alignment is contemporaneous with the
cooking activities associated with thermal Features 14 and 17 (see Figure 6), possibly functioning as a
food preparation or serving platform.
Stratified Random Sample Control Units
A total of six 1 x 1 m2 CUs (A through F) were selectively positioned at various topographic elevations
across 41VV2012 utilizing a stratified random sample approach (see Figure 6). The main goal was to
recover micro-artifact samples that could be compared to similar specimens recovered during the feature
focused 1 x 4 m block.
All six CUs were excavated (13 levels in total) using the same methodology employed during the feature
focused 1 x 4 m block excavations. A 25% sample (one 50 x 50 m quadrant per level) was fine screened
through 1/8th inch mesh; the remainder was screened with standard ¼ inch mesh.

Figure 17 View of Feature 19 prior to excavation
Typically the sediments consist of pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry, loose to hard, silty clay loam over pale
yellow (2.5Y 8/3) dry, very hard silty clay. Pea gravels and calcium carbonate flecking and nodules
typically increase with depth, especially below L 2. Excavation of the CUs was terminated in the sterile
deposits corresponding to Zone III.
The CU excavations at 41VV2012 were negative for FCR, and yielded only two pieces of debitage
(Specimens 24.D1 and 25.D2 from L 1 [95.30-95.20 m] and L 2 [95.20-95.10 m], respectively) from CU
E (see Table 6). Both artifacts are pieces of shatter of a similar pinkish-brown chert. The absence of
micro-debitage (specimens less than a ¼ inch in size) suggests that pressure flaking (e.g., edge retouch,
trimming, and final shaping), and tool production in general, did not occur in and around the CUs.
SITE 41VV2013
Based on B&A’s initial field survey at 41VV2013, 13 prehistoric features (F 1, 3 - 6, and 8 - 15) were
slated for data recovery excavations (Figure 18). The upper 10 cm across each 1 x 4 m excavation block
was hand troweled or shovel skimmed to fully expose each feature. Based on a demonstrated lack of
intact subsurface deposits and consultation with TxDOT archeologists, it was decided to terminate the
investigation at four features (F 4, 6, 9 and 11). As such, those features are not described in the following
discussions, though surface artifacts and FCR were quantified. Of the thirteen features slated for
mitigation, nine were fully investigated and are described in the following section. See Appendix G for a
tabulation of all materials (including samples) recovered during the mitigation of 41VV2013.

Feature Descriptions
Feature 1
Feature 1 is interpreted as a disarticulated earth oven with an associated large pavement-like scatter of
cleanout debris (FCR and ash). The 60 x 90 x 14 cm feature core was defined by a northwest to southeast
cluster of adjoining in-situ FCR. The tightly packed FCR was arranged within a poorly defined, 14 cm
deep basin located within EU 1 (Figures 19 through 21). This feature is located in a 35-40 m wide swath
of construction clearing that bisects the site along a northwest to southeast axis. Based on excavation data,
it is presumed that the feature was mechanically truncated during the highway construction activities.
Constituent FCR were either firmly embedded within an ashy, charcoal-flecked grayish brown (10YR
5/2) silty clay feature matrix or loosely clustered to scattered within a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4)
silty clay (Zone III). A large (80 x 80 x 5 cm) ash stain is located approximately 1 m north of the feature
core in EUs 2and 3 (see Figure 19). The ash deposit is predominately absent of FCR and interpreted as an
ash cleanout deposit from past usage of the earth oven. Likewise, a substantial pavement of
approximately 100 loosely clustered FCR is located immediately adjacent to the northeast periphery of
the feature core in EU 1. This loose 15 cm thick (100.60-100.45 m) pavement of FCR also includes
sparse, widely scattered ash and charcoal and is interpreted as FCR cleanout debris. The ash deposit and
FCR pavement associated with the feature core are likely contemporaneous, representing the deposits of
ash and FCR removed from the earth oven following the processing of foodstuffs. The 1 x 4 m excavation
block was positioned to bisect F 1 along a north-south axis along the west wall of EU 2 to provide a cross
section profile of what was, at the time, believed to be the feature center. However, it was later
determined that the feature center was located in EU 1 and its west wall provided the feature profile.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
The excavation of Feature 1 and the associated FCR resulted in the recovery of 737 fire-cracked angular
limestone gravels and cobbles (Table 8). Constituent feature stones include 215 (28.0%) in the < 3 cm
size range, 506 (69.7%) in the 3-10 cm range and 16 (2.3%) in the 10-15 cm range. Excavations from the
1 x 4-m block resulted in the recovery of 82.4 kg of burned limestone rock: 52.0 kg from EU 1, 19.4 kg
from EU 2, 6.8 kg from EU 3 and 4.2 kg from EU 4. As depicted in the L 2 Plan View (see Figure 20),
the majority of the exposed FCR occurred within EUs 1 and 2, though substantially lesser amounts were
also recovered from EUs 3 and 4. Upon completion of the block excavations, the area outside of and
adjacent to EUs 1 and 2 was troweled down approximately 5 cm seeking any feature remnants that may
have extended outside the boundaries of the excavation block (see Figure 20). The troweling outside of,
and adjacent to EUs 1 and 2 revealed a scatter of approximately 30 FCR that extended approximately
1.25 m west of EU 1. This is interpreted as additional FCR cleanout debris and weighed 15.2 kg.
Given the above data, the total combined weight of FCR from Feature 1 is 97.6 kg, with approximately
98% of the FCR consisting of relatively small (≤ 10 cm in diameter) angular stones. The high proportion
of small rocks is indicative of deterioration due to multiple firings. The relatively few remaining stones
fall in the 10-15 cm range; this may have been the preferred original size.

Special Samples
Radiocarbon
Excavation of Feature 1 resulted in the recovery of eight charcoal samples (Lots 76, 88–91, 94, 118, and
123). Three samples from discrete contexts (Lots 91,118, and 123) were submitted for AMS processing
(Beta 292970, Beta 292974 and Beta 292975, respectively) (Table 10). Beta 292970 was collected from
the in-situ core of the earth oven in EU 1 at 100.58 m and yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD
1537 to 1635 (413 to 315 BP). Beta 292974 was collected from the adjacent FCR scatter (cleanout debris)
located in EU 2, L2, at 100.52 m and provides a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 1489 to 1603 (461
to 347 BP). Excavators obtained the third charcoal sample (Beta 292975) from the base of the feature
along its northeastern edge at 100.50 m which provided a calibrated 2-Sigma date range of AD 1492 to
1602 (458 to 348 BP).
Beta 292974 and Beta 292975 returned comparable 2-sigma calibrated date ranges of AD 1489 to 1603
and AD 1492 to 1602, respectively. Given these essentially identical date ranges, it is likely that both
samples originated from a single large chunk or “log” of charcoal. In comparison, Beta 292970 produced
a slightly later date range of AD 1537 to 1635. The date ranges provided by these three samples suggest
that the earth oven was used between AD 1489 and 1635 (461 and 315 BP).

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Flotation/Macrobotanical
A total of 12 liters of feature matrix from five samples (Lots 69, 77, 93, 117, and 124) were collected for
flotation and two samples (Lots 91 and 118) were collected for wood identification. Lots 117 and 124
were submitted for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. The results of the flotation analysis reveal a
predominance of wood charcoal. In order of prevalence, identified wood taxa include mesquite/acacia,
granjeno (desert hackberry), oak, and sycamore. Lots 91 and 118 were submitted for wood identification;
both were identified as mesquite/acacia (see Appendix D). Additional recovery includes possible edible
food resources represented by two charred prickly pear seeds. While the sample count is low, the presence
of the charred seeds suggests that prickly pear pads and fruits (tunas) were consumed or utilized as
packing/steaming material (Black et al. Volume 1, 1997:66).
The variety of fuel wood identified in Feature 1 suggests that the prehistoric inhabitants likely utilized the
full spectrum of fuel wood available in the local area, including the collection of species (e.g., granejo,
oak, and sycamore) from riparian zones within the lower San Felipe Creek basin, adjacent valley slopes,
and along the tributaries of San Felipe Creek that flow through the eastern edge of 41VV2013. The
surrounding xeric uplands were also sources of fuel wood, such as mesquite/acacia species. The general
lack of charcoal from woody shrub species such as javelina bush, elbowbrush, and guayacan, indicates a
preference for longer, hotter burning tree wood better suited for the production of coals for use in an
earth oven.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 1 is a moderate-sized thermal feature with a cumulative burned limestone rock weight of 97.6 kg.
Fuel wood utilized in the feature consisted of mesquite/acacia, oak, hackberry, and sycamore and possible
food plants were indicated by the presence of two charred prickly pear seeds. Three AMS radiocarbon
assays indicate a Late Prehistoric use sometime between AD 1489 and 1635 (461 to 315 BP). Based on
the excavation results, particularly the in-situ feature elements, size of the ash pit, and size and number of
FCR, coupled with the radiocarbon dating of the various feature elements, Feature 1 appears to represent
a repeatedly used earth oven with associated ash and FCR discard areas.
Feature 3
Feature 3 was recorded as a small 70 x 60 cm hearth containing FCR, ash, and charcoal in a shallow 10cm deep basin. The feature was partially capped by a thin veneer of Zone I eolian sand and was intrusive
into Zone III. The surface expression consisted of an embedded cluster of angular burned limestone and
fossiliferous sandstone cobbles surrounded by a surficial scatter of FCR (Figure 22). Average size of
constituent FCR was 3-10 cm with approximately 90% consisting of limestone and 10% fossiliferous
sandstone. A 1 x 4 m excavation block was positioned so that the east walls of EUs 1 and 2 provide a
north/south feature profile. The excavation of L 1 and 2 (across the block) revealed a shallow basin as
well as two discrete clusters of FCR, ash, and charcoal within close proximity of one another. These
adjacent clusters are interpreted as feature cleanout debris areas (Figures 23 and 24).
The central core of F 3 consisted of approximately 20 firmly embedded angular burned limestone rocks
with an associated scatter of 40 to 50 surficial FCR (limestone and sandstone). Excavation within EU 1

Figure 24 Feature 3: view of exposed hearth and FCR clusters, base of Level 1
and 2 exposed an approximately 70 cm wide by 10 cm deep (101.13-101.03 m) basin in L 1 and 2 that
contained ashy feature fill above an undulating feature base at the contact between Zones I and III
(Figure 25).
Associated with the basin were two discrete surface clusters of FCR, ash, and charcoal sitting on Zone III
The largest cluster (40 x 40 cm) was located 75 cm northwest of the feature core; it contained
approximately 35 burned limestone cobbles (3-10 cm in size) within a shallow depression (see
Figure 25). Although there was a slight depression, there was no evidence of a formal basin; the
depression likely reflects the natural undulation of the Zone III surface. This 40 x 40 cm cluster of FCR is
interpreted as feature cleanout debris. The second FCR cluster (45 x 40 cm) was approximately 80 cm
west of the feature core and consisted of approximately 15 burned limestone cobbles. As with the
previous cluster, this scatter was predominately surficial having been only partially buried by relatively
recent Zone I deposits. Both clusters are interpreted as clean out debris areas of the core feature.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
Excavations at Feature 3 recovered a total of 435 FCR weighing 21.7 kg. The majority (48%) of the FCR
was recovered from the feature core in EU 2, L 2 (101.10-101.00 m) (see Table 8). Limestone is the
dominate rock type (96.5%), while fossiliferous sandstone was observed in low amounts. The FCR

predominately measures 3-10 cm in size (63%) with the remainder (37%) falling within the < 3 cm range.
The absence of large cobbles and slabs suggests that this feature was repeatedly heated, resulting in the
deterioration of the constituent stones into smaller pieces. This process is reflected in the two associated
cleanout/discard piles of FCR scattered around the feature core.
Artifacts
A total of 15 artifacts (see Table 9), comprised of 12 pieces of chert debitage, two depleted cores, and a 1
x-1 cm fragment of red ochre, were recovered during the block excavation at Feature 3. The debitage is
primarily decorticate (75%) and consists of small percussion flakes (n=5), flake fragments (n=3), and
chips (n=4). Of particular interest was the recovery of two small (3 x 3 cm) depleted multidirectional
chert cores (non-thermally altered) from EU 2 and 3, L1 in (101.14-101.10 m) that suggest limited hard
hammer core reduction occurred adjacent to Feature 3.
The presence of ochre is unique to Feature 3; this specimen (142.01) was recovered from the ¼ inch mesh
screen during the screening of EU 3, L 2 (101.10-101.00 m). No obvious cultural modification of the
fragment is evident and its association with cultural activities at Feature 3 is inconclusive.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
A charcoal sample (Beta 292976) collected from the northernmost cleanout pile was point plotted (EU 3,
L 2, 101.07 m) and submitted for AMS processing. Additional charcoal was collected but appeared to
have been subjected to high rates of bioturbation via insect, worm, and sheetwash or were from poor
contexts (i.e., the ¼ or ⅛ inch excavation screens). Beta 292976 yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range
of AD 1447 to 1527 (see Table 10).
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Investigations collected four feature matrix samples (Lots 156–158 and 166) and one macrobotanical/
wood identification sample (Lot 143). Of these, Lots 157 and 158 were submitted for flotation and
macrobotanical analysis. Twelve liters of feature matrix (Lot 157) was collected from the northernmost
discard pile (EU 2, L 2, 101.10-101.00 m), while six additional liters (Lot 158) of feature matrix was
collected from the basin in the feature core (EU 2, L 2, 101.10-101.00 m).
The 12.0 liters of feature matrix in Lot 157 contained upland xeric species consisting of mesquite/acacia,
condalia/javelina bush, and elbowbush. Potential edible plant remains recovered from flotation include
one granjeno (desert hackberry) one sugarberry nutlet, one prickly pear seed, and one mesquite seed.
Macrobotanical recovery from the six liters of feature matrix collected from the basin in the feature core
(Lot 158) yielded somewhat similar xeric species consisting of mesquite/acacia, condalia/javelina bush,
and elbowbush, though remains of pecan wood were also identified.
Exploitation of the upland xeric trees and woody shrubs, for use as firewood is indicated. The presence of
pecan wood in the feature basin indicates use of the San Felipe Creek riparian zone as well. Edible plant
species include low numbers of granjeno (nutlet), mesquite (seed), prickly pear (seed), and sugarberry
(nutlet). As suggested by Dr. Dering, the sugarberry and granjeno are likely intrusive given a coating of
calcium carbonate and lack of charring (see Appendix D). The mesquite and prickly pear seeds are
80

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

typical food items recovered from prehistoric sites in the Lower Pecos, yet the presence of only a single
item each precludes valid dietary assumptions.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 3 was a relatively small 70 x 60 cm hearth with a shallow (10 cm) subsurface basin utilized
between AD 1447 and 1527. Associated clusters of cleanout debris (FCR, ash, charcoal) suggest that this
feature was utilized multiple times. Xeric upland shrub and tree species were utilized as fuel wood, as was
pecan wood, likely procured from the nearby San Felipe Creek riparian zone. Edible plant remains
identified during macrobotanical analysis consist of a Granjeno nutlet, a mesquite seed, a prickly pear
seed, and a sugarberry nutlet. The low recovery of potential edible resources and likelihood of intrusive
elements (i.e., the Granjeno and sugarberry nutlets) provide relatively inconclusive dietary deductions.
Further, a total FCR weight of 21.7 kg indicates that this was not a large processing feature.
Feature 4
Feature excavations abandoned after L 1.
Feature 5
On the surface, Feature 5 appeared as a 25 x 25 cm cluster of embedded fire-cracked limestone cobbles.
The cluster is interpreted as a hearth which has most likely been displaced by sheet erosion resulting in a
lack of firm cohesion. An associated scatter of surficial displaced FCR encircles the feature. This widely
scattered surficial FCR is likely a combination of cleanout debris and rock displayed by sheet wash and
soil creep.
A 1 x 4 m excavation block was positioned to cross cut the feature along a north-south axis within EU 1
which was best situated to bisect the presumed feature core (Figure 26). Two to three levels (L 1 - 3,
100.17-99.80 m) were excavated across the block and the feature core was exposed in the entire 1 m west
wall profile of EU 1. It revealed a small ovate ashy stain measuring approximately 10 cm long x 3 cm
wide, with a scant amount of charcoal and a cluster of overlapping FCR from the surface to 6 - 7cm
below surface (bs).
The feature core is located in Zone I (eolian veneer) and rests on a shallow (6 -7 cm deep) undulating
basin-shaped depression at the surface of the Zone II paleosol (Figure 27). The soil beneath the feature
core exhibited no oxidation, suggesting that there was no intense and/or prolonged exposure to high
temperatures.
Based on the results of the feature profile, an approximate 1 x 1-m area was excavated immediately west
of EU 1. This informal excavation was intended to fully expose the feature (Feature Remnant) and allow
for the full quantification of the entire FCR weight. The troweling revealed a large ovate ashy stain
containing scant FCR and charcoal (Figure 28). The stain measured 97 cm N/S x 45 cm E/W x 5 cm deep
(100.05 - 100.00 m). Similar to the feature core in EU 1, the base of the ashy stain was diffuse and poorly
defined.

Excavation Recovery--FCR
Feature 5 consisted of 131 fire-cracked limestone rocks weighing 9.9 kg (see Table 8). The majority
(71%) of these measures 3-10 cm in diameter, while the remainder (29%) measures < 3 cm. In the 1 x 4 m
block, only EUs 1 and 2 contained FCR associated within the feature (EU 1, 23 FCR, 2.2 kg and EU 2, 2
FCR, 0.1 kg). The majority of FCR (81%) occurred outside and west of the 1 x 4 m block.
Artifacts
A total of 14 pieces of chert debitage and two modern animal bones were recovered from the block
excavation (see Table 9). The debitage consists of five flakes and nine chips (12 decorticate and two
corticate); of these, the raw material types are varieties of gray chert with one black hornfels. The faunal
specimens (Lot 2, Specimen 25.F1) include two small unburned 6.8 x 0.8 cm and 2.9 x 0.7 cm humerus
fragments from a small mammal. The bones are recent and not considered to be food remains associated
with the feature.
The majority (n=6/43%) of the debitage was recovered in L 1 (100.17-100.10 m) of EU 2 with minimal
amounts in EUs 1 and 3. The paucity of artifacts and the lack of a reduction group preclude valid
functional assumptions.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
Excavation of Feature 5 resulted in the collection of three charcoal samples (Lots 49, 51, and 52). Lot 51
was recovered from the core of the feature that extended west of EU and was selected for AMS
processing (Beta 292966). Beta 292966 yielded a 2-Sigma calibrated date range of AD 1489–1603 (461–
347 BP) (see Table 10).
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Two feature matrix samples (Lots 42 and 50) and one macrobotanical/wood identification sample
(Lot 51) were collected and submitted for analysis (see Appendix D). The Lot 42 matrix sample (3.3
liters) was collected from the center of the feature core in EU 1, L 1 (100.10-100.00 m). The Lot 50
matrix sample (4.0 liters) was collected from the ashy central core of the feature extension located west of
EU 1 (100.10-100.00 m) (see Figure 28). The lone macrobotanical/wood identification sample was also
collected from the ashy feature deposit located west of EU 1.
Flotation analysis yielded only wood charcoal, with no edible plant remains present. Wood charcoal
includes mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, ocotillo, and granjeno. Mesquite/acacia (45%) and Texas
persimmon (34%) were the most prevalent charcoal types identified. The macrobotanical sample was
identified as mesquite/acacia. These results indicate that the uplands and riparian zones were utilized as
sources for firewood; Texas persimmon was likely gathered from the lower rocky slopes above arroyos
and from riparian zones within the San Felipe Creek drainage basin. The mesquite/acacia, ocotillo, and
granjeno were likely concentrated on upland ridges and mid-slopes, similar to the location of 41VV2013.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 5 was a relatively small, somewhat displaced hearth with a shallow basin. A lack of oxidized
earth and diffuse basal boundary of the basin obscures a definitive interpretation. Regardless, the lack of
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

85

oxidized earth below the feature suggests that the soil was not exposed to intense and/or prolonged heat.
Analysis of the macrobotanical remains recovered from the feature matrix was negative for edible plant
species. The identified wood charcoal indicates the utilization of the encompassing uplands
(mesquite/acacia, ocotillo, and granjeno), as well as the rocky side slopes of arroyos (Texas persimmon)
within the San Felipe Creek catchment basin. A single AMS date of AD 1489 - 1603 (347-461 BP)
indicates that this Late Prehistoric feature is very similar in age to Feature 1 (AD 1489 to 1635)
previously described.
Feature 6
Feature excavations abandoned.
Feature 8
Feature 8 was initially documented as a large (approximately 5 x 5 m) disturbed ash and FCR scatter. The
burned limestone cobble deposits were heavily impacted by vegetation clearing (bulldozing) and
scarification (root plowing) associated with highway construction activities (Figures 29 and 30). Plow
furrows from the scarification, measuring 25 cm deep x 35 cm wide and 60 cm apart, were visible within
the feature as excavations progressed. Between each furrow were berms of turned and piled soil and rock
(see Figure 29). A critical question for the excavators was whether the FCR located within and between
the furrows were in-situ and whether any intact buried feature deposits were present.
A 1 x 4 m excavation block was positioned to cross cut the darkest ash and charcoal stain and expose any
potential in-situ deposits located between the furrows. Excavation of four levels (approximately 99.8099.40 m) in EUs 1 - 4 revealed discontinuous “pockets” of intact, embedded FCR and/or fire hardened
(oxidized) matrix. As expected, the linear clusters of surficially exposed FCR within the furrows were
determined to be displaced. However, given the presence of some in-situ ash and charcoal staining,
especially within L 2 of EU 1 (99.70-99.60 m), an additional 1 x 1 m2 unit (EU 5) was excavated west of
EU 1 (Figure 31). The excavation of EU 5 revealed FCR and oxidized earth within a dark ashy stain that
had been greatly impacted by the scarification of the ROW with heavy mixing of deposits. Based on the
results of the excavations, Feature 8 represents the disarticulated remains of a large (approximately 1.5 x
1.5 m) indeterminate thermal feature.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
Feature 8 yielded 838 FCR weighing 82.4 kg, of these, 31 (3.6%) are sandstone while the majority
(96.4%) are heavily burned and fractured limestone cobbles and rocks (see Table 8). Approximately
50.2% of the constituent FCR measure < 3 cm in diameter, 48% measure 3-10 cm, and 2.1% are in the
10-15 cm size range. The 10-15 cm sized specimens likely represent the initial unburned size of rocks
originally selected for feature construction, as they exhibit less intensive burning and thermal exposure
than those in the smaller size ranges. The preponderance of relatively small-sized FCR suggests repeated
usage and/or high temperatures for extended periods.
The occurrence of 57% (by weight) of the FCR discovered west of EU 1 is a reflection of the
displacement caused by the bulldozing of the feature core located somewhere between EUs 1, 2, and 5.

Figure 29 View of Feature 8 prior to excavation
Note furrows from scarification of ROW
As depicted in Table 8, Level 2 (99.70-99.60 m) in EUs 1 and 2 clearly contained the majority of the
FCR, suggesting the approximate vertical core of the intact feature deposits.
Artifacts
A total of 45 lithic artifacts were recovered from the excavation of Feature 8 (see Table 9). These include
20 chert flakes, two flake fragments, one core, two utilized flakes, one trimmed flake, and 19 pieces of
angular lithic debris (shatter). As with the FCR, the majority of the artifacts (67%) were recovered in L 2
(99.70-99.60 m) of all units, thereby supporting the contention that L 2 represents the core of the feature
deposit.

Special Samples
Radiocarbon
A total of 12 charcoal samples were collected from Feature 8. After assessing the contexts from which the
samples were obtained, the four samples (Lots 55, 70, 92, and 103) collected from the most secure
contexts were submitted for AMS dating (see Table 10). The sample from Lot 55 (Beta 292967) derived
from EU 1, while Lots 70 and 92 (Beta 292969 and Beta 292971, respectively) were collected from EU 2,
and Lot 103 (Beta 292972) was collected from EU 5. Three (Beta 292967, Beta 292969 and Beta 292971)
of the four samples were collected from discrete point plotted contexts in L 1, 3, and 4 (99.74-99.40 m),
while the fourth sample (Lot 103) was recovered from the ¼ inch mesh screen. All the samples, except
Lot 103, were recovered from intact deposits located near or at the base of the feature.
Interestingly, of the four dated samples, three (Beta 292969, Beta 292971, and Beta 292972) returned
identical 2-Sigma calibrated date ranges of AD 1537 to 1635). This suggests that the three samples
originated from a single source, such as a large “log” of charcoal. The fourth dated sample (Beta 292967)
returned a slightly older 2-Sigma calibrated date range of AD 1487 to 1604. The date ranges suggest that
the feature was utilized more than once, which is supported by the prevalence of FCR in the 3-10 cm and
< 3 cm size diameter ranges suggestive of repeated heating and cooling.
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Two feature matrix samples (Lots 73 and 100 m) and four macrobotanical/wood identification samples
(Lots 55, 74, 92, and 103) were submitted for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Both matrix samples
were collected from the feature core in EU 1 (Lot 73 from L 3, 99.60-99.54 m) and EU 5 (Lot 100 from L
2, 99.70-99.60 m). Of the four macrobotanical samples, two (Lots 55 and 92) were obtained from discrete
point plotted contexts and two (Lots 74 and 103) were collected from the ¼ inch screen. These samples
originated in EUs 1, 2, and 5 (L 1, 3, and 4, respectively).
Analysis of 12.3 liters of feature matrix resulted in the identification of charred mesquite/acacia,
mesquite, guayacan, and an indeterminate species, as well as two pecan nut fragments and one prickly
pear seed. The presence of pecan nut fragments suggests that the San Felipe Creek riparian zone was
exploited. A single prickly pear seed, while suggestive of the processing of or consumption of prickly
pear tunas and/or pads, must be viewed cautiously. As Dering notes (see Appendix D), a single tuna can
contain over fifty seeds; the presence of a single seed is relatively inconclusive in terms of
subsistence data.
The analysis of four separate macrobotanical/wood identification samples from EUs 1, 2, and 5 resulted
in the identification of mesquite/acacia wood. In conjunction with the three identical radiocarbon date
obtained from Beta 292969, Beta 292971, and Beta 292972, it is reasonable to presume that both the
charcoal samples and the macrobotanical/wood identification samples probably originated from the same
source, such as mesquite branches and/or logs.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 8 appears to be the remnants of an indeterminate Late Prehistoric (AD 1537 to 1635) thermal
feature partially buried by a late Holocene eolian veneer (Zone I) and later severely impacted by

90

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

bulldozing and root plowing activities associated with the highway construction activities. Excavation of
the 1 x 4-m block (EUs 1-4), and the additional 1 x 1-m EU 5 identified “pockets” of discontinuous
embedded FCR and ashy feature deposits separated by deep plow scars and areas of extensive mixing.
The total weight of 82.4 kg indicates that Feature 8 contained a substantial amount of locally procured
limestone and sandstone rock. The feature matrix analysis revealed a preponderance of mesquite/acacia
wood charcoal with lesser amounts of guayacan. Two pecan nut fragments and a lone prickly pear seed
indicate likely edible plant foodstuffs. The presence of two utilized and one trimmed flake also suggest
that slicing and cutting activities, likely associated with food processing, occurred at or adjacent to the
feature. Due to pronounced mechanical displacement of the feature coupled with moderate to high
amounts of mixing, a definitive function of this thermal feature is not possible.
Feature 9
Feature excavations abandoned.
Feature 10
Feature 10 was a tight approximately 50 x 50 cm cluster of approximately 35 embedded burned limestone
cobbles with an associated surficial scatter (150 x 100 cm) of approximately 50 FCR. The FCR was
exposed in a deep plow furrow along the extreme eastern mid-slope of 41VV2013 (Figure 32). Although
obviously impacted by road construction activities (vegetation clearing and root plowing) the potential
remained for buried cultural material based on the topographic position of the feature and associated
colluvial deposition (see Figure 17). Hand troweling around F 10 exposed discontinuous areas of
thermally oxidized soil, thus formal excavation of the feature continued.
A 1 x 4 m excavation block (EUs 1 through 4) was positioned to crosscut the feature along a north/south
axis within EUs 1 and 2 positioned to profile the feature core (see Figure 32). Excavation of three levels
in EUs 1 and 2 (96.36–96.10 m) (Figure 33) and two levels in EUs 3 and 4 (96.35–96.20 m) exposed
localized areas of oxidized soil approximately 6 cm below the ground surface. Below these shallow
deposits were sparse amounts of widely scattered FCR. The deposits represent the highly disturbed
remnants of an unknown feature type which was situated on top of the Zone II paleosol and later buried
by a veneer of Zone I eolian sand and silt.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
As depicted in the plan view of F 10 (see Figure 32), the majority of the exposed FCR was located in EU
1 with lesser amounts in EU 2; this pattern was consistent during excavation. The excavation of F 10
yielded 265 FCR weighing 19.6 kg (see Table 8). With the addition of 49 FCR (6.5 kg), from the feature
area that extended east of EUs 1 and 2 (Feature Remnant), the total of FCR is 314 with a cumulative
weight of 26.1 kg.
Table 8 illustrates that EU 1 contained the majority (70%) of FCR and 56% of the weight. Approximately
38% of the feature constituent FCR measure < 3 cm in diameter, 60% measure 3–10 cm, and 2% measure
10–15 cm. Given that 98% of the feature stones are angular, broken and fire-cracked into small fragments
suggests repeated use of burned rocks that prior to usage were likely in the 10-15 cm size range.

Artifacts
A total of nine lithic artifacts were recovered from the excavation of Feature 10 (see Table 9). The
artifacts include one chert core, four chert flakes, three chert flake fragments, and one chert chip. Eight of
the nine specimens were recovered from the surface or Level 2 of EU 2. Due to the mechanical
displacement and high rate of mixing, it was impossible to discern a living surface or determine a direct
association between the artifacts and the feature. Regardless, the presence of a core and lithic debitage in
close proximity to F 10 strongly suggests that core reduction occurred near the feature.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
The lack of in-situ charcoal fragments or carbonaceous feature matrix prevented further inquiry into the
age of Feature 10.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 10 was a small cluster of approximately 35 embedded FCR with an associated surface
concentration of approximately 50 FCR and an additional 229 FCR mixed between the surface and the
bottom of L 2. This feature was exposed in the base and walls of a deep plow furrow. Due to the obvious
mechanical impacts and, to a lesser degree the sheetwash erosion, the Feature 10 deposits proved to be
discontinuous, heavily mixed, and mostly devoid of cultural material. No suitable feature matrix or
charcoal was observed; therefore, the age and the type of use remain unknown.
Feature 11
Feature excavations abandoned.
Feature 12
Feature 12 is interpreted as a small earth oven; it measured 65 x 60 cm containing ash and FCR clustered
within a well defined, shallow (approximately 15 cm) basin. Initially documented as a surface scatter of
approximately 60 limestone and sandstone FCR (Figure 34), the excavation revealed intact buried
deposits below the disturbed Zone I eolian veneer intruding into the underlying non-cultural Zone III.
This feature was one in a grouping of four thermal features (F 9 through 12) located at the eastern
boundary of the 41VV2013, overlooking the unnamed tributary of San Felipe Creek (see Figure 17).
A 1 x 4 m excavation block (EUs 1 through 4) bisected F 12 on a north/south axis with EUs 2 and 3 cross
sectioning the feature along its midline (see Figure 34). Initial excavation consisted of removing 2–8 cm
of Zone I deposits which had been artificially bermed to each side of the feature (Figure 35). Scattered,
non-cohesive FCR overlaid hard, silty clay Zone III deposits. As the surface of Zone III was fully
exposed, L 1 (96.50–96.40 m) was removed across the block. Excavation of L 2 (96.40–96.30 m) verified
that only EU 2 (northwestern quadrant) and 3 (southwestern quadrant) contained cultural deposits and
thus EU 1 and 4 were terminated in sterile Zone IV strata.
Once the eastern boundary of the feature was fully defined within L 3 (96.30-96.20 m), EU 2 and 3 were
reduced to 1 x .50 m2 in order to avoid excavation of known sterile deposits. Once the feature was
removed from within L 3, the west wall profile revealed that the feature possessed an underlying welldefined basin (see Figure 35). The feature fill of ash and FCR was recorded and removed. The FCR from

the basin consisted of thin (approximately 2-3 cm) tabular sandstone slabs positioned along the basin
walls at a downward oblique angle, as well as along the bottom of the basin. The base of Feature 12 was
flat and terminated at the surface of the hard Zone IV.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
As presented in Table 8, F 12 contained 277 FCR weighing 28.1 kg; this includes the 76 FCR (11.7 kg)
recovered from the primarily surficial feature extending west beyond the EU 2 and 3 (Feature Remnant).
The densest concentration of all FCR (38% of the total number and 65% of the total weight) was
recovered in Level 2 (96.40-96.30 m) of EU 2 and 3. The FCR raw material type is 90% limestone and
10% sandstone. Approximately 68.5% of the feature stones measure 3–10 cm in diameter, 30.6% measure
< 3 cm and 0.9% measure 10-15 cm. All of the FCR located outside of the basin are considered cleanout
debris.
Artifacts
A total of six artifacts (see Table 9) were recovered from Feature 12. The artifacts consist of lithic
debitage: five chert flakes (three decorticate and two corticate) and one piece of decorticate shatter. These
artifacts were collected from the surface or near the surface (L 1, 96.50-96.40 m) from loose eolian
deposits (Zone I). Based on the small sample and their questionable context, nothing conclusive can be
surmised from this dataset.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
Three charcoal samples (Lots 147, 153, and 173) were collected from Feature 12 and submitted for AMS
dating (see Table 10 and Appendix C). Lots 147 and 153 (Beta 292977 and Beta 292978, respectively)
were collected in-situ during excavation of the feature core, while Lot 173 (Beta 292979) was obtained in
the laboratory from a matrix sample collected at the base of the feature. These samples provided
somewhat disparate results: AD 136-266 (Beta 292977); AD 247-419 (Beta 292978); and AD 53-259
(Beta 292979). The range of dates presumably is the result of the mixing of charcoal through time via
FCR recycling and re-use of charcoal during various episodes of feature use. It is believed that Beta
292978 is from the most reliable context and has the greatest statistical probability of being accurate (see
Table 10 and Appendix C). Feature 12 dates to approximately AD 247–419 (1703–1531 BP) period,
which corresponds with the Transitional Archaic and is characterized regionally as the Blue Hills
Subperiod (ca. 2,300-1,300 BP) (Turpin 2004: 274).
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Two feature matrix samples (Lots 148 and 154) collected from the core of the feature provided 13.5 liters
of matrix for analysis. Botanical analysis identified wood charcoal belonging to mesquite/acacia;
cottonwood/willow, oak, and an indeterminate species (see Appendix D). The only identified edible
resources are two onion bulb fragments. The presence of mostly long lasting, hot coal producing woods
likely reflects the usage of the feature as an earth oven. The presence of cottonwood/willow point to the
utilization of the San Felipe Creek riparian zone for wood collection and suggests a wetter period where
pooled water was available closer to the site during the Transitional Archaic period.

Based on the small size of this presumed earth oven (28.1 kg) it is likely that Feature 12 was not utilized
for extended cooking periods (e.g., 24–48 hours) (Dering 1999:664; Thoms 2008:453) but rather cooking
time from one to three hours which is consistent with cooking starch-rich foods and meat (Wandsnider
1997: 25).
Concluding Remarks
Feature 12 appears to be the base of a small earth oven dating to AD 247–419 (1,531–1,703 BP) within
the Transitional Archaic time period and characterized by the Blue Hills Subperiod. The relatively low
quantity and weight of the FCR suggests that Feature 12 was a small-scale version of larger earth ovens
which process large amounts of foodstuffs for extended periods of time, specifically lechuguilla (Agave
lechuguilla) and sotol (Dasylirion texanum). The presence of sustained hot burning charcoal within the
well defined slab-lined basin and the presence of an adjacent cleanout debris field suggest that Feature 12
functioned as a sealed cooking apparatus (i.e., earth oven) for small scale processing/cooking that
required hours rather than days. Albeit tentative, the recovery of the two onion bulb fragments from the
feature matrix (see Appendix D) supports this hypothesis.
Feature 13
Feature 13 was a FCR scatter measuring approximately 3.5 x 2.5 m and consisting of approximately 80
burned limestone (84%) and sandstone (16%) cobbles. The feature was impacted by mechanical
disturbances associated with vegetation clearing and root plowing from construction activities related to
the current project. This resulted in a roughly linear (northwest by southeast) alignment of dispersed FCR
oriented parallel to the plow furrows (Figure 36).
During the excavation of a 1 x 4 m block, a single layer of shallowly buried (100.10-100.04 m) FCR and
ash was exposed near the base of L 1 (100.12-100.00 m) of EU 2 (Figure 37). This deposit is interpreted
as cleanout debris, likely originating from an adjacent unidentified feature. Of note was the presence of
the deep furrows from scarification of the ROW that significantly impacted the feature both horizontally
and vertically.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
A total of 108 FCR, with a cumulative weight of 11.2 kg, was recovered in Feature 13 (see Table 8). The
majority of the FCR (approximately 60%) was discovered in-situ in L 1 (100.12-100.00 m) of EU 2. As a
whole, the majority (94%) of FCR measured in the 3-10 cm size range with six rocks measuring 10-15
cm. The small FCR fragments suggest repeated use or extended periods of heating, which cause heavy
fracturing. The FCR and ashy feature matrix is interpreted as discard debris from another thermal feature
which was not exposed.
Artifacts
The excavations resulted in the recovery of one core, two ceramic (refits) sherds, five complete flakes,
one chip, and one piece of shatter. These were recovered solely in L 1 (100.13-100.00 m) across the entire
1 x 4 m block (see Table 9). The ceramic sherds (Specimens 108.C1 and 108.C2) are two of six sherds
recovered from 41VV2013 but are the only ceramics discovered in an excavated context. Both specimens
were found while fine mesh (1/8th inch) screening the deposits in the southwest quadrant of EU 2, L 1

(100.12-100.00 m); a single flake was also recovered from the same deposit. The sherds are unburned and
physically associated with F 13. Based on the surficial nature of the other four sherds and the level of
mechanical impacts (horizontal and vertical displacement) that occurred on-site, the possibility that these
sherds were once surficial but eventually buried by bioturbation processes is high. The association of a
core and seven pieces of debitage is inconclusive considering that the debitage and core are different raw
materials and minimally suggest lithic reduction activities occurred within proximity of Feature 13.
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
A single charcoal sample (Lot 107) was recovered from the in-situ feature core in EU 2, L 1 (100.12100.00 m). AMS processing of the sample (Beta 292973) provided a calibrated 2-Sigma date range of AD
1619–1670 (see Table 10).
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Excavators collected two feature matrix samples (Lots 106 and 109) and one macrobotanical/wood
identification sample (Lot 107) from the feature core in EU 2, L 1(100.12-100.00 m). Flotation and
macrobotanical analysis of 5.2 liters of feature matrix resulted in the identification of wood charcoal from
mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, oak, sycamore, and granjeno. In addition, three charred onion bulb
fragments were identified; this is suggestive that such plants were consumed and/or processed at F 13 (see
Appendix D). The macrobotanical sample (Lot 107) submitted for species identification is
mesquite/acacia wood. Based on the quantities identified for each species, the data point to the
predominant utilization of upland xeric species for fuel wood with some use of riparian species (i.e., oak
and sycamore) along San Felipe Creek and its nearby tributaries.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 13 is a displaced FCR accumulation with shallowly buried ash and scattered FCR interpreted as a
cleanout debris area from an unidentified thermal feature. Radiocarbon dated to AD 1619–1670, this
feature is one of six adjacent thermal features dated to the Late Prehistoric period that cumulatively make
up Locus A, a tight cluster of seven features (see Figure 17).
Feature 14
Feature 14 is an irregularly shaped pavement of adjoining and overlapping burned limestone and
sandstone cobbles prepared on the deflated surface of Zone III. Although the FCR was not extensively
fractured or discolored, in-situ cracking was common. The excavation results were negative for ash and
charcoal as well as heat oxidized soil; it appeared to have been minimally utilized, possibly as an open-air
griddle.
The 1 x 4 m excavation block fully encompassed the feature with EU 2 containing the majority of the
shallowly buried deposits (Figure 38). An additional 1 x 1-m unit (EU 5) was placed adjacent to and east
of EU 2 to expose the eastern extent of the feature located beyond the 1 x 4 m block. The removal of two
to three levels (99.44-99.20 m) across the block allowed full exposure and pedestaling of the F 14 core
(Figure 39). The loose surficial soil and FCR were removed in L 1 (99.40-99.36 m) leaving the
embedded FCR in place. Level 1a (99.36-99.30 m) was added to expose and pedestal the feature core;

The north arrow is in Unit 5
while L 2 (99.30-99.20 m) undercut the feature to expose the contact between the feature base and Zone
III (Figure 40). Once fully exposed, the feature was repeatedly cross-sectioned and removed.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
The excavation of Feature 14 resulted in the collection of 375 FCR weighing 29.8 kg. The majority (80%)
occurred in EU 2, L 2 (99.30-99.20 m), which represents the core of the pavement/griddle-like feature. Of
the 375 FCR, 371 (98.9%) are limestone and 74.6% of these measure between 3 and10 cm in diameter
(see Table 8). Similar pavement-like griddles are discussed by Thoms (2008:445), Miller (2000:135) and
Black et al. (1997:62-63). A key aspect of Feature 14 is its lack of ash and charcoal, probably a result of
its open-air use. This cooking technique allows the firewood to be reduced to coals and then ash;
subsequent dispersal by wind and rain accounts for their absence.
Artifacts
Four pieces of debitage was recovered during the excavations of Feature 14 (see Table 9). It does not
appear that lithic reduction activities were a focus at F 14; however, the low number of debitage does not
allow for inference as to specific reduction trajectories.

Special Samples
Feature 14 contained no charcoal for radiocarbon dating. A single six-liter feature matrix sample (Lot
169) collected from the base of the feature core was also negative for carbonized plant remains (see
Appendix D).
Concluding Remarks
Feature 14 is a tight pavement of shallowly buried FCR interpreted as an open-air griddle. The feature
was constructed almost entirely of loosely stacked and adjoining thermally altered limestone cobbles
positioned on the unprepared surface of Zone III. Uneven heating of the FCR and a lack of ash and
charcoal suggest minimal utilization of the feature. Since radiocarbon and botanical samples were not
discovered, F14 remains undated and its function unknown. The minimal thermal alteration of the FCR
might suggest a stone boiling scenario yet the lack of an adjacent pit feature and the varying size of the
FCR (see Table 8) weaken that possibility. The flat, tightly clustered construction, coupled with the
presence of in-situ cracked stones indicates that Feature 14 is most likely an open-air, hot rock griddle
likely used for roasting, broiling, or parching of plant and/or animal foodstuffs (Black et al. 1997:63-65).
Feature 15
Feature 15 is a large 1.0 x 2.5 m cluster of FCR and ash located between two 30 cm deep, parallel plow
furrows oriented northwest to southeast which were created during the ROW clearing and scarification.
The mechanical impacts displaced and obscured the northern and southern feature boundaries, as well as
truncating (i.e., bulldozer) an unknown amount of the feature. The feature alignment is a reflection of
those impacts.
The 1 x 4 m excavation block was positioned to cross cut the feature along its north/south axis in EU 2 in
order to provide a profile along the features eastern edge (Figure 41). Excavation of three levels (100.35100.00 m), across the block fully exposed and isolated the in-situ feature core in EUs 2 and 3 (Figure 42)
with the majority of the FCR contained within Level 2 (100.30-100.20 m).
The F 15 profile displayed a wide, shallow (10 cm deep), flat bottomed basin filled with ash and FCR
(Figure 43). Due to mechanical impacts and soil mixing, it was impossible to determine whether the
feature was truly intrusive into Zone II or merely the results of downward translocation. A lack of
thermally oxidized soil at the base and outer edges of the feature suggests that the ash and FCR fill were
not fired in-situ but dumped at this location as clean out from an unknown source.
Excavation Recovery—FCR
A total of 453 FCR weighing 34.9 kg were removed from Feature 15. The majority (40% by count and
49% by weight) of the FCR occurred in EU 2, L 2 (100.30-100.20 m). Most of the FCR (75%) measure
between 3 and 10 cm in diameter, while 25% measure < 3 cm. Only six limestone cobbles (1.0%)
measure in the 10-15 cm range, suggesting that the bulk of the FCR was repeatedly fired until it no longer
retained sufficient heat. The depleted FCR along with the lack of oxidized soil around the feature strongly
indicate that the feature represents cleanout fill from an adjacent thermal feature.

Artifacts
A total of 13 lithic artifacts were recovered from the excavation at F 15 (see Table 9). These include 10
pieces of debitage, one biface fragment, one trimmed flake, and one Perdiz arrow point fragment
(Specimen 24.P1). The artifacts are fairly evenly distributed across the 1 x 4 m block, though the majority
(38%) occurred in EU 1.
The presence of a Perdiz arrow point fragment (EU 4, L 2, 100.30-100.20 m) is of particular interest.
Unfortunately, this arrow point was found in the screened soils from EU 4 located north of the in-situ
feature; therefore, its association with the feature is tentative. Although not recovered in-situ, the
chronological association of the Perdiz type (ca. AD 1200–1500) (Turner and Hester 1993:227) correlates
well with two of the three radiocarbon assays processed from the feature (Beta 292964 and Beta 292965)
and falls well within the range of the third radiocarbon assay (Beta 292968 (see below).
Special Samples
Radiocarbon
A total of eight charcoal samples (Lots 16, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 43, and 67) were collected from Feature 15.
Based on context, only three (Lots 16, 38 and 58) were submitted for radiocarbon analysis (Beta 292964,
Beta 292965 and Beta 292968, respectively) (see Table 10). The three samples were collected from the
in-situ feature core in EU 2, L 2 (100.30-100.20 m) and resulted in somewhat similar calibrated 2-Sigma
date ranges: AD 1447–1527 (Beta 292964), AD 1408–1451 (Beta 292965) and AD 1470–1639 (Beta
292968). The AD 1408–1639 time span encompassed by the three radiocarbon date ranges places Feature
15 within the Late Prehistoric Period characterized by the Lower Pecos Blue Hills subperiod (Turpin
2004:274) and correlates well with the Perdiz arrow point fragment recovered from EU 4.
Flotation/Macrobotanical
Flotation and analysis of 7.2 liters of feature matrix (Lots 17 and 39) and five macrobotanical/wood
identification samples (Lots 16, 31, and 43a–43c) resulted in the identification of charred wood from
mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, pecan, and cottonwood/willow trees, as well as condalia/javelina
bush (see Appendix D). The samples were negative for edible plant foodstuffs. The wood identification
indicates that the upland hills and slopes were targeted for mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, and
condalia/javelina bush procurement. In contrast, the pecan and cottonwood/willow remains indicate that
riparian areas along San Felipe Creek and its numerous tributaries were also targeted for fuel wood. It is
likely that the condalia/javelina bush represent kindling utilized to start a fire. The majority of the charred
samples were mesquite/acacia with progressively lesser amounts of fuel wood from the lower elevations
(i.e., pecan and cottonwood/willow) near San Felipe Creek. The predominance of fuel wood from the
uplands is likely a simple reflection of abundance and ease of availability.
Concluding Remarks
Feature 15 was a large, mostly buried deposit of FCR and ash truncated and displaced by natural erosion
and modern mechanical disturbances. This feature is interpreted as a cleanout dump from an unidentified
but presumably nearby thermal feature. The lack of thermally oxidized soil below and adjacent to the
feature indicates that the burning of the feature deposits occurred elsewhere. The 1 x 4 m block yielded 13

lithic artifacts including a Perdiz arrow point fragment. The 453 pieces of FCR (34.9 kg) were quantified
with the vast majority (70%) measuring less than 10 cm in diameter.
The results of the flotation and macrobotanical analysis indicate a mix of upland and riparian species (i.e.,
mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, and condalia/javelina bush, pecan and cottonwood/willow) were
selected for fuel wood. Radiocarbon assays indicate that Feature 15 was utilized during the AD 1408–
1639 time period that corresponds with the Late Prehistoric Perdiz arrow point recovered during the
feature excavations.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Data recovery at prehistoric sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 resulted in an artifact assemblage containing
380 chipped-stone specimens, six ceramic sherds, five groundstone fragments, one faunal specimen, and
one piece of ochre. The following chapter discusses the artifact assemblage by site and includes tabulated
data as needed. A discussion of lithic use-wear can be found in Appendix H.
41VV2012
Thirteen lithic artifacts were recovered during the data recovery investigation at 41VV2012. These consist
of one dart point fragment, three utilized flakes, eight debitage fragments, and one mano fragment.
Archeologists recovered 11 (84.6%) of the specimens (all of the debitage fragments and utilized flakes)
from subsurface contexts; all specimens are tabulated by provenience in Table 11. Raw material types
include a variety of gray cherts and limited amounts of quartzite and fine-grained limestone. Dimensional
data for each artifact class is tabulated for complete specimens solely.

Projectile Point
A single Frio dart point (Turner and Hester 1993: 122) fragment was recovered at 41VV2012 (Figure 44
and Table 12). This artifact (Specimen 22.1) was surface collected without any particular feature
association.
Specimen 22.1 is nearly complete, missing only the distal tip. It is well made with an elongated triangular
body with slightly serrated lateral edges and small side notches that form slightly rounded shoulders and
an expanding stem with a shallow but wide concave basal indention (see Figure 44). The raw material
has been heat-treated resulting in a pinkish cream colored fine-grained chert. The presence of a rolling
hinge fracture and lack of an impact fracture suggest that the tool may have been broken during an
alternate use other than as a projectile. Frio dart points are regionally characteristic of the Blue Hills subphase (ca. 350 BC – 650 BC) (Turpin 2004: 274) and according to Turner and Hester (1993:122) date to
the Transitional Archaic period (ca. 200 BC–AD 600).

Three edge-modified and eight unmodified specimens were recovered from the subsurface. These were
recovered within the top 20 cm of the cultural deposits.
Utilized Debitage
Utilized debitage have one or multiple edges altered by use. The three flake specimens recovered from
41VV2012 exhibit use-wear in the form of discontinuous micro-scars (nibbling) along their straight to
convex lateral edges. Two of the three specimens (1.D1 and 21.D1) are made on a gray chert flake; the
third (2.D2) is made on a cream colored fine-grained limestone flake (Table 13).

Based on the limited data set coupled with the proximity of one hearth (F-14) and an earth oven (F-17), it
is likely that these artifacts were used as expedient cutting tools during plant processing.

Unmodified Debitage
Eight specimens of unmodified debitage, one complete flake, and seven pieces of shatter were recovered
from 41VV2012 (Table 14). Based on the limited lithic dataset, no valid inferences can be made other
than that lithic reduction was not a major activity within the study area at 41VV2012.

As Table 14 indicates, complete flakes comprise 12.5% (N=1) and shatter comprises 87.5% (N=7) of the
unmodified debitage assemblage; flake fragments and chips are absent. Two specimens (24.D1 and
25.D1) exhibit thermal alteration. In total, two (25%) unmodified debitage specimens retain cortex; the
remaining six shatter specimens (75%) lack cortex. Only one piece of debitage retained a striking
platform; it is ground and indicates intentional preparation to obtain an appropriate angle to facilitate
flake removal.
Groundstone
One medial fragment of a four-sided mano (Specimen 23.1) was recovered from the ground surface at
41VV2012. It is ovoid in cross-section with one flat and one convex end; although all sides have been
ground smooth, it is more exaggerated on the flattened end. The raw material type is a pinkish- brown

quartzite, which has been fire-cracked, possibly due to reuse of the artifact in a thermal feature. Since the
artifact was surface collected and not recovered from a feature context, this is conjecture.
Conclusions
The material culture recovery from 41VV2012 is extremely sparse, thereby limiting inferences
concerning site activities, particularly with regards to lithic reduction and tool functionality.
Cumulatively, the 13 lithic artifacts (one Frio dart point, one mano fragment, three utilized flakes, and
eight pieces of debitage) indicate that very basic lithic reduction occurred within the site study area.
The single groundstone fragment was likely utilized for plant processing associated with one of the
thermal features, and subsequently utilized as a hearth stone. The presence of three utilized flakes
suggests that cutting (presumably plant resources given a complete lack of faunal remains) activities with
expedient tools occurred.
The diagnostic Frio dart point (ca. 200 BC – AD 600) predates the thermal features dated between AD
1301 and AD 1448; it appears to have been curated and reused during this latter period. The date range
for the features is consistent with Toyah phase (ca. 1200 AD – 1500 AD) occupations in Central and
South Texas.
41VV2013
Data recovery at 41VV2013 resulted in the recovery of 380 artifacts; the assemblage includes 372 lithic
artifacts, six ceramic sherds, two faunal fragments, and one piece of ochre. The artifact assemblage is
listed by Specimen Number, Type and Provenience in Appendix G. The majority of artifacts (55.9%)
was collected from the ground surface; the subsurface assemblage (44.1%) was collected between 0 and
10 cmbs (25.3%), 10 and 20 cmbs (15.8%) and 20 and 40 cmbs (3.0%). Due to the substantial surface
disturbances documented at 41VV2013 (vegetation clearing, root plowing and bioturbation) correlations
with specific stratigraphic zones was not possible. The results of the excavation indicate that the majority
of the archeological deposits (features and artifacts) were either surficial or shallowly buried; and that no
deeply buried deposits occur.
Lithic Artifacts
Lithic artifacts (n= 372) recovered from 41VV2013 consist of nine dart points (2.4%), three arrow points
(0.8%), ten bifaces (2.7%), one butted knife (0.3%), one drill/perforator (0.3%), four unifaces (1.1%),
four ground stone artifacts (1.1%), 27 cores and core fragments (7.2%), nine edge-modified flakes (2.4%),
12 utilized flakes (3.2%)`, and 292 pieces of unmodified debitage (78.5%). The raw material type is
primarily an assortment of cherts and substantially lesser amounts of hornsfel, fine grained limestone,
quartzite and chalcedony. These appear to be locally procured with no exotic types present.
Dimension in millimeters (mm), weight in grams (g), raw material, and additional metric attributes are
described in relevant tables for each lithic tool class discussed below. If a tool was determined
incomplete, analysis did not include maximum dimensions for particular variables as appropriate.

Projectile Points and Point Fragments
A total of 12 projectile points and point fragments were recovered from 41VV2013 (Table 15 and
Figure 45); of these, nine are complete or almost complete. The dart point assemblage includes one
Langtry (Specimen 7.143), one Almagre (Specimen 130.183), three Ensor (Specimens 6.133, 14.149, and
15.163), one Ensor-like (Specimen 5.12), two Frio (Specimens 130.186 and 168.203), and one Figueroalike (Specimen 171.MS.PI). The arrow point assemblage includes two fragmentary Perdiz (Specimens
3.132 and 24.PI) and one Perdiz-like (Specimen 5.13). With the exception of one Perdiz (Specimen
24.P1), all of the projectile points were collected from the ground surface. The dart point assemblage,
with the exception of the Almagre and Langtry dart points, generally exhibit expanding stems and bases
characteristic of the triangular-bladed Ensor/Frio continuum dated to the Transitional Archaic (ca. 200
BC to AD 600). The temporally diagnostic artifacts date from the Middle Archaic (ca. 2500 BC to 1000
BC), the Transitional Archaic (ca. 200 BC to AD 600), and Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric (ca. 1,200-AD
1500) time periods (Turner and Hester 1999).
Dart Points
Langtry dart points are characteristic of the San Felipe subperiod (ca. 2150 BC to 1250 BC) (Turpin
2004:268, 270) of the Middle Archaic period (ca. 2500 BC to 1000 BC) and occur throughout the Lower
Pecos and infrequently in south and south-central Texas regions (Turner and Hester 1999:143-144).
Specimen 7.143 is the only Langtry dart point recovered from the site (see Figure 45k). The raw material
type is a pinkish-gray heat-treated chert which is patinated on one face. This dart point is very thin and
well made with a missing distal tip, incomplete short flared barbs, an alternately beveled and tapered stem
with a concave base, and straight to recurved (modified) lateral edges. After the distal tip suffered an
impact fracture, this specimen was most likely used as a cutting tool.
Almagre dart points occur throughout the Lower Pecos Region and into south Texas during the Middle
Archaic period; it is postulated that this type actually represents Langtry preforms (Turner and Hester
1999: 26 and 69-70). Specimen 130.183 is the only Almagre dart point recovered from the site. The raw
material type is a variegated gray and brown, low quality chert. It exhibits crude flaking on a triangular
body, one slight to moderate shoulder, and a sharply contracting stem. It is missing its distal tip and one
shoulder; no apparent impact fracture is noted (see Figure 45l).
Ensor dart points are associated with the Blue Hills subperiod (ca. 350 BC – AD 650) (Turpin 2004:274)
within the Transitional Archaic period dating to ca. 200 BC – AD 600 (Turner and Hester 1999:114) and
are widely distributed throughout central and south Texas. Specimen 5.12 is classified as an Ensor-like
dart point (see Figure 45f) and Specimens 6.133 (see Figure 45g), 14.149 (see Figure 45h) and 15.613
(see Figure 45i) are formal Ensor dart points (see Table 15). These specimens have generally straight
bases, shallow side notches and broad, expanding stems. Three of the four exhibit extensive alternate
beveling interpreted as resharpening for reuse as knives.
Specimen 5.12 is missing the distal tip which was broken by a step fracture. It is made from gray chert
and displays large, alternately-flaked and shallow side notches, weak barbs, a wide stem, and a straight
base (see Table 15). Specimen 6.133 is complete and made from a grayish-white chert. It displays

slightly convex blades, alternately-flaked and shallow side notches, weak barbs, a wide stem, and a
slightly convex base (see Table 15). Specimen 14.149 is complete and made from a white chert. It
displays straight lateral edges, alternately-flaked and shallow side notches, weak barbs, a wide stem, and a
straight base (see Table 15).
Frio dart points, as well as Ensor dart points are characteristic of the Blue Hills subperiod (ca. 350 BC to
AD 650) of the Late Archaic Period (Turpin 2004:274) and the Transitional Archaic (ca. 200 BC – AD
600) period (Turner and Hester 1999:122) They are widely distributed in central and south Texas,
extending to the Lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos Regions (Turner and Hester 1999:112; Turpin 2004).
Specimens 130.186 (see Figure 45d) and 168.203 (see Figure 45e) are classified as Frio dart points (see
Table 15). Both are heavily re-sharpened creating recurved lateral edges indicative of reuse as cutting
implements. Specimen 130.186 is complete with strong shoulders, moderate side notches, and a shallow
basal notch.
Specimen 168.203 is a nearly complete specimen, missing the extreme distal tip (see Table 15 and
Figure 45e). The raw material is a white chert with pink thermal alteration and one large potlid. The
specimen displays straight to recurved lateral edges, small barbs, shallow side notches, and a moderately
wide stem with a concave basal indentation. It is made on a flake and lacks extensive bifacial thinning
which is not typical of Frio dart points, possibly suggesting that the dart point was not completed.
Figueroa dart points typically have broad, shallow side-notches which help form wide expanding stems;
these date to the Transitional Archaic (ca. 200 BC – AD 600) and are common in the Lower Pecos
(Turner and Hester 1999:118). Specimen 171.MS.P1 is thick and crudely flaked on a poor quality gray
chert with weak shoulders, one shallow side notch, a thinned convex base, and slightly recurved lateral
edges with steep beveling on one side (see Table 15 and Figure 45j). It was likely reutilized as a cutting
tool.
Arrow Points
The Late Prehistoric arrow point assemblage consists of two fragmentary Perdiz arrow points (Specimens
3.132 and 24.PI) and a Perdiz-like blade fragment (Specimen 5.13) (see Table 15). Perdiz arrow points
date to the Late Prehistoric Period and are characteristic of the Flecha subperiod (AD 630 – AD 1500)
within the Lower Pecos region (Turpin 2004:274). Specimen 24.P1 (see Figure 45a) is the only
diagnostic lithic artifact to be recovered from a subsurface context and in association with a feature (F 15,
EU 4, L 2, 100.30 – 100.20 m). This artifact has light patination on its dorsal surface and heavy patination
on its ventral surface indicating it was exposed on the ground surface for an extended period of time.
Therefore, the subsurface context and feature association may be the results of surface disturbances (road
clearing, etc.) and/or bioturbation processes.
Specimen 24.P1 is missing the distal end and one barb, both the result of snap fractures. It is made of a
pink translucent chert with a remnant flake facet on one face. The specimen displays straight lateral
edges, strong sharp barbs, and a sharply pointed contracting stem (see Table 15 and Figure 45a).

118

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Specimen 3.132 is missing the distal tip, as well as one barb and part of the stem; both removed by snap
fractures (see Table 15 and Figure 45b). It is made of white chert with a remnant flake facet on one face.
It displays straight lateral edges, strong sharp barbs, and a contracting stem (see).
Specimen 5.13 is an unusually long (28.88 mm) blade fragment; it was unifacially shaped with rolling
hinge fractures at the distal and proximal ends (see Table 15 and Figure 45c). Discontinuous use-wear is
evident along both lateral edges indicative of reuse as a cutting implement. It is made of a pinkish-gray
chert and retains a remnant flake facet on one face.
Bifaces and Biface Fragments
Artifacts bearing flake scars on both faces are classified as bifaces; the specimens that could be assigned
to a particular tool type or function (e.g., projectile point, perforator, knife, etc.) were placed within their
specific subcategory and will be discussed as such. The remaining specimens that could not be defined as
formal tools or tool fragments are placed within a general biface category.
The reduction trajectory for biface manufacturing is viewed as a four stage sequence, with Stage 4
representing the completed tool type (e.g., dart points, knives, etc.). For a thorough discussion of the
reduction model the interested reader is referred to Goode (2002: 30-38) and Black et al. (1997: 455-457).
Stage 1: decortication and initial thinning.
Stage 2: major thinning and initial shaping.
Stage 3: final percussion thinning and major shaping.
Stage 4: final shaping and sharpening.
A total of two bifaces and eight biface fragments were recovered during data recovery excavations at
41VV2013 (Table 16). These specimens are grouped and discussed by reduction stage:
Stage 1: None recovered.
Stage II: One biface (Specimen 130.187) and one biface fragment (Specimen 15.161) was recovered (see
Table 16). Specimen 130.187 is a complete biface made from brownish gray chert. It displays sinuous
lateral edges, and a plano-convex cross-section. Extreme use-wear is evident along one lateral edge.
Specimen 15.161 is a fairly thick distal fragment made of brownish gray chert with a perverse fracture
and sinuous edges. Based on its relative thickness (14.78 mm), it was likely snapped during manufacture.
Seven Stage III bifaces were recovered; of these, only one (Specimen 171.MS.B1) is thin, exhibits
sinuous lateral edges, and appears to be a finished arrow point preform made of brownish gray chert
(Table 16 and Figure 46).
The remaining six bifaces (Specimens 4.130, 5.14, 5.15, 5.50, 13.173 and 171.MS.B2) are fragmentary,
predominantly made of gray chert and typically snapped at the midline. Specimen 4.130 is a distal
fragment displaying a snap fracture and sinuous lateral edges. Specimen 5.14 is a proximal fragment with
a sinuous edged, rounded base. It exhibits extensive thermal alteration (potlidding and crazing) and a

hinge fracture across its approximate midline. Specimen 5.15 is a very thin (2.44 mm) distal fragment
made of pinkish chert. It is snapped across the blade and likely reflects an arrow point preform broken
during manufacture. Specimen 5.50 is a proximal fragment of a probable arrow point preform made of
gray chert; it has a contracting stem and the lower blade element is fragmented across the midline.
Specimen 13.173 is a distal fragment made of high quality brown chert; it has a hinge fracture across the
midline, sinuous lateral edges and was likely broken during manufacture. Specimen 171.MS.B2 is a
medial fragment made of fine grained grayish brown chert with heavy patination on one face and light
patination on the other (Figure 47 and see Table 16). It exhibits thin, straight lateral edges and a proximal
hinge and distal snap fractures.

Figure 47 Representative Stage III biface (Specimen No. 171.MS.B1) from 41VV2013
A single biface fragment of unknown stage (Specimen 29.B1) completes the biface assemblage as no
Stage IV bifaces were discovered. Specimen 29.B1 is a small, medial fragment of gray chert which
retains a single thinned lateral edge. The presence of a hinge and perverse fracture preclude any
reasonable inferences.
The recovery of only ten bifaces indicates that biface production was not necessarily the primary focus of
activity within the 41VV2013 study area. Of the ten bifaces, only two are complete specimens.
Additionally, all but one was recovered from the surface; only 29.B1 was recovered within a feature
excavation (F-15, Unit 1, Level 2, 100.30 – 100.20 m).
Given the characteristics of the biface inventory (coupled with the debitage assemblage [see below]), it
appears that the initial reduction of the lithic raw material from which these bifaces were manufactured
occurred off site, presumably at or near their sources; hence the paucity of corticate (i.e., Stage I)
specimens. The occupants of the site likely introduced the largely decorticate, thick Stage II bifaces to the
site for further reduction/thinning for formal tool production, such as projectile points or knives. Based on
the occurrence of only two complete bifaces (Stages 2 and 3) it is presumed that the finished products left
the site with their manufacturers.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

121

However, the Stage I through IV biface assemblage is small and only limited inferences may be drawn.
Given the relatively few complete and incomplete formal tools (as well as relatively low recovery of
bifacial reduction flakes from the debitage assemblage) recovered during data recovery, formal tool
production appears not to have been pervasive.
In contrast to the above, cores and core fragments, as well as, edge-modified and utilized debitage,
account for a combined 12.9% of the lithic artifact assemblage recovered from 41VV2013. As such, it
appears then that informal expedient flake tools detached from multidirectional cores may have been a
common activity.
Butted Knife
Specimen 10.174 is a large teardrop-shaped biface with convex lateral edges and retains cortex along both
lateral edges. The extreme proximal end has been snapped and the resulting sharp edges dulled by
battering, presumably to provide a more comfortable hand grip (Figure 48 and Table 17).

Bifacially worked; teardrop-shaped;

(butted) knife

The distal edge is relatively delicate and thinned by a series of sequentially removed flakes. This thinness
is in contrast to the more common “chopper” category typically found in relative abundance within the
region. Use-wear gloss is pronounced on both faces of the distal end indicating extensive use presumably
as a cutting tool. Similar specimens are reported from Uvalde County by Lukowski (1987: 231-232).
Turner and Hester (1999: 243) place it within the Late Archaic (650 BC – 300 BC).
Perforator
A drill/perforator is a formal tool used for puncturing/piercing leather, wood, and other materials. A
single artifact (Specimen 130.188) is classified as a perforator (Figure 49). The tool is triangular in form
and roughly diamond-shaped in cross-section; it was manufactured from a secondary flake of tan chert (.
The working bit measures approximately 23.69 mm long by 15.65 mm wide (Table 18). The perforator is
bifacially flaked at the distal end and has a smoothed sheen from extensive use along both lateral edges.

Unifaces
Four unifaces (Specimens 2.131, 6.138, 14.148, and 168.204) were discovered during data recovery
(Table 19). Specimen 2.131 is a large side scraper made from a hornfels cobble. It displays patterned
flake removal along one lateral edge as well as extensive use-wear along the same dorsal face. This is
likely a hand held scraping tool as suggested by the smoothly worn cortex along the backed edge of
the tool.

Specimen 6.138 is a complete unifacial side and end scraper made of gray chert. The ventral surface is
flat with a convex dorsal surface. The worked edges exhibit steep unifacial retouch along three of the four
dorsal surfaces.
Specimen 14.148 is a complete tear drop shaped unifacial side and end scraper made on a gray chert
secondary flake. Steep retouch occurred on both lateral edges as well as the distal bit edges.
Specimen 168.204 is a fragmented unifacial side and end scraper missing a lateral edge. It was
manufactured from a tertiary flake of high quality translucent brownish-gray chert. The scraper exhibits a
steeply worked distal edge and a very thin proximal end which suggests that it was hafted.
Cores
A total of 27 cores and core fragments were recovered at 41VV2013. The artifacts have been divided into
groups based on their striking direction(s): unidirectional cores, bidirectional cores, multidirectional cores
and core fragments. The core data is provided in Tables 20 through 22.

Unidirectional cores usually have a single, flat platform where flakes are detached. Bidirectional cores
have an edge that serves as the platform, with flake removal from opposite directions. Multidirectional

cores have various platforms with flake removal in multiple directions. Core fragments are broken yet
retain negative scar flaking. Of the 27 cores recovered: one is unidirectional, six are bidirectional, seven
are multidirectional cores and 13 are core fragments.
Unidirectional Cores
The single unidirectional core, Specimen 5.28, is an angular fragment of hornfels with several flakes scars
originating at right angles of one lateral edge.
Bidirectional Cores
Six bidirectional cores were analyzed; these consist of Specimens 5.29, 5.39, 64.C1, 79.182, 85.180, and
130.194 (Figure 50 and see Table 22).

Figure 50 Bidirectional cores recovered from 41VV2013
Specimen 5.29 is a tabular depleted core of thermally modified gray chert. It displays discontinuous
bifacial flaking. There is remnant cortex visible on several areas (see Figure 50a). Specimen 5.39 is an
angular core made of granular grey quartzite. It displays bifacial and discontinuous flaking without cortex
(see Figure 50b). Specimen 64.C1 is an angular depleted core made of gray chert. The specimen displays
bifacial and discontinuous flaking with some cortex (see Figure 50c). Specimen 79.182 is an ovoid core
made of brown chert. It displays bifacial and discontinuous flaking with some cortex (see Figure 50d).
Specimen 85.180 is an angular depleted core made of brown chert. It displays bifacial and discontinuous
flaking with some cortex (see Figure 50e). Specimen 130.194 is an angular depleted core made of light
gray chert. It displays bifacial and irregular flaking without cortex (see Figure 50f).

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Interestingly, four of the six cores (66.7%) are depleted leaving no room for additional flake removal and
four of the six (75%) retain cortex.
Multidirectional Cores
The seven multidirectional cores are Specimens 5.89, 80.175, 84.179, 141.C1, 145.C1, 167.C1, and
168.201 (Figure 51 and see Table 22).

Figure 51 Multidirectional cores recovered from 41VV2013
Specimen 5.89 is an angular depleted core made of brownish-gray chert. It displays multidirectional
flaking and lacks cortex (see Figure 51a). Specimen 80.175 is a roughly spherical depleted core made of
brown chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex (see Figure 51b). Specimen 84.179 is a
core fragment made of brown chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex (see Figure
51c). Specimen 141.C1 is an ovoid depleted core made of brown chert. It displays bifacial and
discontinuous flaking without cortex (see Figure 51g). Specimen 145.C1 is an angular depleted core
made of gray chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with a small remnant patch of cortex (see Figure
51d). Specimen 167.C1 is an angular core fragment made of tabular gray chert. It displays
multidirectional flaking with some cortex (see Figure 51e). Specimen 168.201 is an angular depleted core
made of thermally altered, glossy reddish-brown chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with minimal
cortex (see Figure 51f).
The majority of the multidirectional cores have been depleted and retain some cortex.

Core Fragments
Core fragments are the most numerous (48%) type in the core assemblage; yet unfortunately, they offer
limited useful data. The thirteen specimens (5.19, 5.20, 5.63, 5.96, 5.104, 5.112, 8.144, 14.151, 15.162,
15.167, 82.177, 113.C1, and 130.185) are described below.
Specimen 5.19 is an angular core fragment of brown chert. It displays multidirectional and discontinuous
flaking with some cortex. Specimen 5.20 is an angular core fragment made of brown chert. It displays
unifacial flaking with some cortex. Specimen 5.63 is an angular, semi-ovoid core made of thermally
modified pinkish-gray banded chert. It displays unidirectional, semi-patterned flaking with some cortex.
Specimen 5.96 is an angular core fragment made of pink chert (possible thermal modification). It displays
bifacial and discontinuous flaking with some cortex. Specimen 5.104 is an angular core fragment made of
gray chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex. Specimen 5.112 is an angular core
fragment made of gray chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex. Specimen 8.144 is an
angular core made of gray chert. It displays bifacial and discontinuous flaking with some cortex.
Specimen 14.151 is an angular core fragment made of gray chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with
some cortex. Specimen 15.162 is an angular core of brown chert. It displays multidirectional flaking with
some cortex. Specimen 15.167 is an angular core fragment made of tabular brown chert with thermal
fractures and crazing. It displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex. Specimen 82.177 is an
angular core fragment made of gray chert. It displays unifacial flaking with some cortex. Specimen
113.C1 is an angular core fragment made of thermally modified brown chert. It displays bifacial
discontinuous flaking with some cortex. 130.185 is an angular core fragment made of brown chert. It
displays multidirectional flaking with some cortex.
Core Summary
The majority of the cores (less the core fragments) recovered from 41VV2013 are made on stream worn
chert gravels, of which 79% retain some cortex and 65% are depleted leaving no room for additional flake
removal. Being predominantly surficial in context, no time diagnostic reduction methods can be surmised
from specific stratigraphic locations.
Debitage
A total of 313 pieces of debitage were recovered during the data recovery investigations at 41VV2013.
The assemblage has been divided into edge-modified debitage (nine specimens), utilized debitage (twelve
specimens) and unmodified debitage (292 specimens).
Edge-Modified Debitage
Nine specimens (Specimens 5.79, 5.110, 21.T1, 62.F2, 83.178, 86.181, 130.200, 168.202, and
171.MS.F1) are categorized as edge-modified debitage, which is defined here as any intentional edge
trimming for producing expedient tools. These specimens have been minimally flaked to form a working
edge along one or more faces (Table 23). Based primarily on a lack of faunal materials, these expedient
tools are assumed to have been utilized during plant processing.

the dorsal surface along one lateral margin. Specimen 20.T1 is a medial, tertiary flake fragment with
unifacial retouch along one lateral edge. Specimen 62.F2 is a complete secondary flake of hornfels. It
displays unifacial retouch on the ventral surface along one lateral edge. Specimen 83.178 is the medial
fragment of a secondary flake of gray chert. It displays bifacial retouch on one lateral edge and unifacial
retouch on the dorsal surface of the opposing lateral edge, likely representing a cutting or multi-function
tool. Specimen 86.181 is the proximal fragment of a pinkish-gray chert tertiary flake. It displays unifacial
retouch and use-wear polish on the dorsal surface of one lateral edge and likely functioned as a knife.
Specimen 130.200 is a complete light pinkish-gray chert secondary flake. It displays unifacial retouch and
use-wear polish on the dorsal surface of one lateral edge and distal end; it likely functioned as a knife or
scraper. Specimen 168.202 is a complete secondary flake made from a light gray chert. It displays steep
unifacial retouch on the dorsal surface of one lateral edge and the distal end, and likely functioned as
a knife.

Utilized Debitage
Twelve specimens (5.17, 5.23, 5.118, 9.147, 14.152, 15.156, 62.F1, 102.F1, 138.F1, 163.F1, 168.208, and
171.MS.F2) are classified as utilized debitage (Table 24). Utilized debitage typically exhibit small,
uniform micro-flake scars (nibbling) often with edge rounding or polish as a result of use. These
specimens display edge damage consistent with use-wear (identified either macroscopically or through
use of a 10x magnifying hand lens)

pinkish-gray and brown banded chert secondary blade flake with use-wear on both faces of one
lateral edge.
Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage exhibits no appearance of having been used or altered for use. In total, 292 pieces of
unmodified debitage were recovered from 41VV2013. The assemblage was analyzed to determine flake
characteristics: flake segment, platform type, cortex type (smooth or coarse), presence/absence of
thermal modification, and raw material type. Flake segments are divided into four categories: complete
flakes, flake fragments, chips, and shatter.
The four categories of flake segments are defined here. Complete flakes retain a platform and bulb of
percussion with a termination at the distal end. Flake fragments contain a platform feature (proximal end)
yet lack termination (distal end). Chips are pieces of flakes that lack proximal ends yet contain some flake
attributes such as percussion rings or a feathered distal end. Shatter is pieces of lithic residue that have no
definitive flake attributes. Of the 292 specimens analyzed, 142 are complete flakes, 27 are flake
fragments, 103 are chips and 20 are shatter. Complete flakes were further divided based on reduction
stage: primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary flakes comprise 3.1% (n=9), secondary flakes comprise
17.5% (n=51), and tertiary flakes comprise 79.4% (n=232) of the unmodified debitage assemblage. Given
the relatively low proportion (20.6%) of primary and secondary flakes in the assemblage, it appears that
the initial reduction of most lithic raw material occurred off site or on a part of the site outside the Del Rio
Outer Loop ROW.
The second characteristic examined for each flake was the platform type. A total of 169 flakes and flake
fragments were analyzed. Five different platform types were classified as single facet (29.1%), multi-facet
(15.5%), ground (4.9%), cortex (6.3%), crushed (10.3%) or missing (33.9%). Single facet platforms are
flat and have only one facet. Multi-facet platforms have two or more facets. Ground platforms have been
smoothed through grinding/abrasion. Cortex platforms retain the weathered cortex, which acted as the
striking platform during initial direct hard hammer percussion. Finally, crushed platforms were crushed
by the force applied to the striking platform in order to remove them from the objective piece. Based on
this data, 44.2% is either crushed or missing. In contrast, 35.4% exhibit single facets and cortex facets
consistent with hard hammer reduction of unprepared cores. The remaining 20.4% exhibits multiple
faceted and ground platforms associated with direct percussion reduction of prepared cores, likely during
the reduction of bifaces.
The third characteristic examined was the cortex type; 61 specimens retained cortex, 53 (86.9%) have
smooth cortex and eight (13.1%) have coarse cortex. The preponderance of smooth cortex indicates that
stream worn, fluvial gravel sources were favored. The coarse cortex is assumed to originate from local
tabular bedrock outcrops.
Thermal modification was noted on 21 (7.2%) of the unmodified debitage. This low number indicates
that annealing of cobbles was unnecessary, likely a direct result of a suitable variety of readily available
gravels within the proximity of the site.

The final characteristic is raw material type which mainly consists of various hued brownish-gray cherts
(93.2%) with dramatically lesser amounts of hornsfel (4.9%), fine-grained limestone (1.3%), quartzite
(0.3%) and chalcedony (0.3%). The locally procured chert was overwhelmingly favored, presumably
readily available in the many gravel streambeds and from the ancient Uvalde Gravel deposits mapped
near the site.
Groundstone and Groundstone Fragments
Four groundstone artifacts (Specimens 5.124, 12.172, 130.191, and 168.205) were recovered from the
ground surface; the assemblage consists of two nondescript mano fragments (12.172 and 168.205), one
metate fragment (130.191), and a unique muller/nutting stone (5.124).
Specimen 12.172 is a well made two-sided mano corner fragment measuring 1.5 cm thick with thinned
(0.5 cm) edges. Specimen 168.205 is a rounded edge fragment measuring about 3 cm thick. The raw
material for both specimens is red quartzite
The one-sided metate fragment (Specimen 130.191) has been unifacially ground creating one smoothed
flat surface. The opposing surface is unmodified natural limestone; it measures 4 cm thick. The raw
material is a pinkish gray tabular limestone with dark red discoloration on the ground surface. It has been
heavily burned and broken, possibly due to reuse in a thermal feature.
Specimen 5.124 is a relatively large spherical and biconvex limestone muller (Figure 53). The artifact
measures 12 cm in diameter and 6.5 cm in thickness; it weighs 1,148 grams. Based on several different
wear patterns (multidirectional striations, battering and smoothing) exhibited along both faces and along
the lateral edges, this cobble was a multifunctional tool. The entire outer edge has been sporadically
battered to various degrees with some smoothing. Two thirds of one face has been ground smooth with
significant battering breaking through the cortex in the center. The opposing face has been ground in two
small areas with minor battering near the center. Heavy pecking and battering, which has created
concavities on both faces is commonly associated with nut cracking activities. Based on the size and
weight of this artifact, it is likely that it was not part of the mobile toolkit, but remained on site.
Ceramics
Six plain earthenware ceramic sherds were recovered (Figure 54); of these, only one (Specimen 108.C1)
was recovered within an excavated context (F 13, Unit 2, Level 1, 100.12 – 100.00 m); however, it is
probable that the sherd was introduced into the feature by mechanical and/or natural processes.
Typological and technological analysis performed by Dr. David G. Robinson indicates that these ceramics
are similar to the assemblage of ceramics recovered at the nearby San Felipe Springs site (41VV444).
These likely represent locally manufactured Leon Plain technology. The complete analysis is provided in
Appendix F.

Faunal Remains
One faunal specimen, Specimen 25.F1, was recovered from 41VV2013. It consists of two small
mammalian fragments, separated by a green break fracture, that refit to form the proximal end plus half of
the shaft of a humerus. The incomplete nature of the specimen precludes measurement; however, it has a
weight of 4.7 grams (g). Following the Andrews (1990) and Lyman (1994:355) stages of weathering for
small mammals, this specimen is assigned a weathering stage of two or three (1-5 or 3-5+ years) as it
exhibits slight to extensive splitting parallel to fiber structure but little flaking. The specimen closely
resembles the humerus of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (Gilbert 1990:298); however, without comparison to a
mammalian collection, species identification cannot be conclusively determined. No cultural modification
is evident on the specimen although it appears to have been gnawed at one end, likely by a rodent or small
carnivore. Finally, the discovery of the faunal specimen in a disturbed and shallow context suggests the
bone may be recently deposited and is not associated with any prehistoric occupation(s) of the site.
Ochre
One small piece of yellow ochre, Specimen 142.O1, was recovered from 41VV2013. It does not display
any cultural modification. It weighs 2.0 grams and measures 11.76 x 8.85 x 3.65 mm. The ochre most
likely originated from the Cretaceous Del Rio Clay.
SURFICIAL ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTION AND PATTERNING: DROP AND TOSS ZONES
Site 41VV2013 is located within an actively degrading environment where archeological deposits are
being displaced and mixed by colluvial and eolian processes. This disturbance, compounded by the
mechanical clearing of vegetation and mechanical scarification of the ROW, resulted in the vertical and
horizontal displacement of many of the artifacts and features. Collection and mapping of the surface
artifacts located within the Drop and Toss Zones was undertaken prior to excavation. Following Binford’s
(1978, 1983) Drop-Toss Zone construct, artifact class and count as well as distance and orientation from
the center of each feature were recorded. The Drop-Toss construct relies on Schiffer’s (1972) primary,
secondary, and de facto refuse categories. Generally defined, primary refuse is discarded at the location
where it is used (i.e., dropped), secondary refuse is discarded at a location other than where it is used (i.e.,
tossed), and de facto refuse is abandoned, instead of discarded, with the possible intent of re-use.
Artifact distribution and patterning within the Drop and Toss Zones for each feature are used to make
tentative behavioral inferences. It is assumed that the surficial artifact assemblage from site 41VV2013
likely represents a palimpsest, most likely representing “physical” associations rather than “functional”
and “temporal” associations (Black 2003:391).
Identifying Drop/Toss Artifact Patterns
A total of thirteen features were surface collected at 41VV2013; of these, nine contained surface artifacts
(F1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14 and 15) within a 3 m radius of the feature core. As previously discussed (see
Methods), all surficial artifacts within 1 m of each mapped feature center are considered to be within the
theoretical Drop Zone; those located between 1–3 m are considered to be within the theoretical Toss
Zone.

Fifty-three artifacts were collected from the nine features examined; of these, five artifacts were
recovered in the Drop Zone and 48 in the Toss Zone. The Drop Zones artifacts consist of one flake
fragment, one chip and three pieces of shatter. The Toss Zone assemblage consists of 37 pieces of
debitage (17 flakes, one flake fragment, 15 chips, and 4 pieces of shatter), two utilized flakes, one edgemodified flake, two projectile points (Perdiz and Ensor-like), two bifaces, one unifacial end scraper, one
core, one core fragment and a single mano.
Although sparse in quantity, the frequency and types of artifacts at each feature seem to suggest that
limited, basic lithic reduction, expedient tool usage and plant processing were common activities at
41VV2013. Specific discussions of the observed each feature assemblage are provided in the following
section and are presented by feature number.
Feature 1: A single thermally altered decorticate chip was collected from the Toss Zone surface.
Feature 3: This feature was negative for Drop-Toss Zone artifacts.
Feature 4: Nine artifacts were dispersed within the eastern half of the Drop and Toss Zones. A single
cortical piece of Hornfels shatter is the only artifact recovered from the Drop Zone. Artifacts from the
Toss Zone consist of four flakes, two chips, one core and one unifacial end scraper (Table 25). The
debitage raw material type is a light gray and light brown chert; the light brown chert debitage may have
been detached from a single core. The lithic assemblage at F 4 is suggestive of limited lithic reduction as
evidenced by the core and debitage. The presence of a single gray chert end scraper is intriguing yet its
presence is inconclusive.

Feature 5: Five artifacts were dispersed in the western half of the Drop and Toss Zones (Table 26). A
single decorticate brown chert flake fragment was recovered in the Drop Zone. The Toss Zone artifacts
include two flakes and two chips, none of which are made from the same lithic material. The small lithic
assemblage precludes any behavioral inferences other than that limited lithic reduction occurred in
the area.

Feature 6: This relatively robust and diverse artifact assemblage (N=14) was recovered from the
northeastern half of the Toss Zone; no artifacts were recovered from the Drop Zone. Five artifact classes
are represented; pieces of debitage, one edge-modified flake, one utilized flake, one core fragment, and
one mano fragment (Table 27). Based upon the presence of a core, debitage, and two edge-modified
flakes, it seems plausible that some of the lithic reduction activities occurring within the Toss Zone were
geared toward the production of expedient flake tools. The two flake tools display micro-scars (nibbling)
along their lateral margins which may be the result of cutting or slicing of plant resources. The
groundstone artifact has been battered along its edges and supports the plant processing scenario.

Feature 8: Based upon the recovery of only two flakes within the Toss Zone, it can be assumed that lithic
reduction most likely occurred within the general area of the feature. The Drop Zone was negative for
cultural materials (Table 28). The lithic raw material includes a dark gray chert and a brown, jasper-like
material.

Feature 9: This feature was negative for Drop/Toss Zone artifacts.
Feature 10: One unmodified cortical flake of dark gray chert was recovered in the Toss Zone; the Drop
Zone contained no cultural materials.
Feature 11: This feature was negative for Drop-Toss Zone artifacts.
Feature 12: This feature was negative for Drop-Toss Zone artifacts.
Feature 13: Ten artifacts were recovered from the southwestern quadrant of the Toss Zone and a single
piece of brown chert shatter was recovered from the Drop Zone (Table 29). Toss Zone artifacts consist of
four artifact classes: two projectile point fragments (one Perdiz arrow point and one Ensor-like dart
point), two Stage 3 biface fragments, one utilized flake, and five pieces of debitage.
The documented lithic assemblage recovered from the Feature 13 Drop-Toss Zone contains a relatively
high frequency (80%) of broken tools. The debitage, however, provides evidence that the manufacture of
projectile points or formal tool manufacture were not the primary activities at/near the feature.
Furthermore, there is no apparent relationship between the debitage and tool assemblage. The debitage
suggests limited lithic reduction activities and not formal tool production; it is more likely the result of
manufacturing of expedient tools, such as edge-modified flakes.

Feature 14: The Toss Zone yielded a single unmodified decorticate chip of dark gray chert collected
from the east half of the Toss Zone.
Feature 15: Two pieces of debitage were recovered from the Drop Zone; seven in the Toss Zone. The
variation in the raw material type (Table 30) is intriguing, as is the predominance of corticate specimens,
but the small sample size does not permit any type of meaningful analysis.

Interpretation of Drop-Toss Zone Patterns at 41VV2013
Given the depositional context and the various mechanical impacts incurred coupled with a lack of
discrete living surfaces, very limited inferences can be surmised. It is plausible that the majority of
artifacts were discarded where they were last utilized (de facto refuse) and that only limited lithic
reduction was occurring. The lack of hammerstones and biface thinning flakes is likely a reflection of
those artifact classes having been removed and reutilized elsewhere. Similarly, a lack of microdebitage
(e.g., pressure flakes) from the surface and subsurface contexts, strongly implies that the final stages of
biface manufacture and/or resharpening of complete tools was not a common activity in proximity of
these features. The lithic tool kit, taken as a whole, generally reflects a plant based (e.g.,
gathering/cooking) subsistence economy.
Minimum Analytical Nodule Analysis
Locus A
The general paucity of artifact concentrations on site 41VV2013 and the obvious clustering of several
features (F 4–6, 8, 13, and 15) and chipped stone artifacts in the west-central portion of the site prompted
B&A archeologists to designate the area as Locus A (see Figure 18). Locus A is distinguished from other
site areas based on the artifact and feature cluster contained within a clearly visible area of ash-stained
soil measuring 30 x 27 m; no other artifact/feature clusters were observed within this site. The physical
proximity of cultural materials suggests that the chipped stone assemblage likely share temporal and/or
functional associations with the cultural features. Due to the surficial context of the artifacts in Locus A,
determinations of direct association among the features and artifacts in the locus are tenuous. All surficial
artifacts were mapped and collected for laboratory analysis; this assemblage was subjected to a Minimum
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

139

Analytical Nodule Analysis (MANA). The results of which are discussed in the following sections. Only
surficial artifacts from Locus A were subjected to a MANA because the remaining collections from the
site represent samples collected during feature-focused excavations.
MANA was performed on the lithic materials collected from Locus A to gather information regarding
behavior as it pertains to lithic technological strategies. Developed by Larson and Kornfeld (1997),
MANA involves sorting of the lithic assemblage into groups and subgroups on the basis of raw material
characteristics such as color, texture, luster, translucency, inclusions, cortex, thermal modification, and
fluorescence (Larson 1994:58; Larson and Ingbar 1992:154). The division process allows the researcher
to identify groups of lithic artifacts which may have been derived from the same parent piece/nodule.
These individual groupings of artifacts are termed minimum analytical nodules (MANs). Once MANs are
established in an assemblage, representative lithic classes (i.e., debitage, cores, and tools) can be used to
infer on- and off-site activities most likely practiced by the individuals that inhabited a particular site and
allow inferences regarding their technological planning strategies. Evidence of direct physical association
is also gathered through the identification of physical conjoins and refits of lithic specimens.
Inferences about behavior and technology were achieved through the analysis of MAN composition.
Larson (1994:59) identifies two nodule types: single item nodules (SINs), consisting of only one lithic
specimen, and multiple item nodules (MINs), consisting of two or more lithic specimens. In the case of a
SIN, it is inferred that an individual manufactured and/or curated the item off-site prior to discarding or
losing it on-site and that the item was not involved in on-site production activities (Larson 1994:59).
MINs include groupings of debitage, cores, and tools or any combination thereof. Based upon the
composition of artifact types (and in some case frequencies), the researcher can identify patterns of
technological organization. For example, MINs containing only debitage imply that tool manufacture was
performed on-site although the tool resulting from this manufacture was transported off-site for use
elsewhere. MINs containing debitage, cores, and tools suggest that raw materials were brought to a site in
order to produce tools which were manufactured, used, maintained, and discarded on-site.
Complimentary to the identification of SINs and MINs are four types of MANs identified by Hall 2004
that simplify the interpretation of on-site and off-site behavior. MAN Types 1–4 are described below and
tabulated in Table 31.
•

MAN Type 1 includes only curated tools manufactured off-site and then transported to a site where
they were lost or discarded without evidence of on-site maintenance. Artifacts belonging to MAN
Type 1 are single or multiple item nodules with no associated lithic debris.

•

MAN Type 2 includes only multiple item nodules comprised of tools and associated tool
maintenance debris. Tools belonging to MAN Type 2 are manufactured or curated off-site and then
transported to a given site where they were subjected to further reduction or maintenance prior to
being lost or discarded

•

MAN Type 3 consists of multiple item nodules containing, at a minimum, debitage and cores,
although tools are often included. The diversity of artifact types in the MAN Type 3 nodule is thought
to be due to the acquisition of bulk material prior to arriving at the site. It assumes that on-site tool
production, use, and discard (i.e., expedient technology) produces MANs consisting of one or more

140

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

cores, debris, and tools; although, tools do not necessarily have to be present for assignment of a
nodule to MAN Type 3.
•

MAN Type 4 accounts for off-site technological needs and is represented by only single or multiple
item nodules consisting of debitage. MAN Type 4 assumes that tools were manufactured and/or
maintained on-site, but were intentionally removed to serve an off-site function (e.g., a projectile
point manufactured on-site and removed for use in hunting activities off-site where it is lost or
discarded) leaving only manufacture debris on-site.

In total, 151 artifact were recovered from Locus A; these consists of 117 pieces of debitage, 15 cores,
eight edge-modified debitage, five projectile points, four bifaces, one unifacial scraper and one
groundstone artifact. Sorting of the artifacts resulted in the identification of 23 multiple item nodules and
23 single item nodules representing all four MAN Types (Table 31).

Multiple Item Nodules
As previously defined MINs consist of multiple items that include groupings of debitage, cores, and tools
in any combination. These groupings (N=23) were analyzed and placed within their respective MAN
Type (MAN Types 1–4) (see Table 31). Clearly the majority of artifacts (69.6%) occur within the MAN
Type 2 (30.4%) and 3 (39.1%) categories. MINs containing debitage and tools (MAN Types 2 and 3)
reflect the manufacture and/or maintenance of either bulk raw material or curated tools and their
subsequent use and discard. The lone artifact assigned to MAN Type 1 is a unifacial scraper (Specimen
2.131) presumably manufactured elsewhere and then lost or discarded in Locus A without evidence of
maintenance. Rounding out the MINs are six artifacts placed in MAN Type 4; these specimens represent
manufacturing-maintenance debris (debitage only) in which the finished product (a formal tool) was
removed and discarded or lost elsewhere.
Taken as a whole, the Locus A MINs reflect a model in which tools were being manufactured and/or
maintained (resharpened) within a confined area (Locus A). Further, the relatively high percentage
(22.5%) of tools present within Locus A, coupled with the fact that the vast majority have been
resharpened and curated; and that 12 of 15 core specimens are fragments too small for further reduction,
clearly indicates that bulk raw lithic material was not easily accessible.
Single Item Nodules
Single item nodules (SINs) were dominated by lithic debitage which accounts for 70.0% (N=16) of the 23
SINs (see Table 31); followed by two projectile points (9%), two cores (9%), one biface (4%), one

ground stone (4%), and one edge modified flake (4%). The preponderance of SINs represented by
debitage only (MAN Type IV) suggests that while formal tool manufacture and/or maintenance occurred,
the majority of the tools were removed from the site and used/discarded elsewhere.
Summary
Of the 151 lithic artifacts recovered from Locus A, a total of 34 (22.5%) consist of formal and informal
tool classes including 15 cores, eight edge-modified flakes, five projectiles points, four bifaces, one
unifacial scraper, and one ground stone. Of these, the cores are the most revealing; 12 of 15 core
fragments were too small for further reduction with the final three being depleted. The predominance of
debitage (77%) is to be expected in an area of obvious lithic reduction as is the presence of edge-modified
flakes (5%). In general, Locus A represents a centralized base of lithic reduction focused around a
specific cluster of thermal features (F 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, and 15) in which lithic tool production and
maintenance (cores, curated tools, etc.) occurred, with lithic raw materials being utilized to the point of
exhaustion. The lack of discrete living surfaces, knapping events, dump features, and the overall paucity
of debitage severely limited further interpretive results regarding lithic organization and mobility.
Following is a summary of the MANs and raw material types.
Group 1 (Table 32): The raw material that comprises Group1 is classified as hornfels. This material is
predominately fine to coarse grained and of low to moderate quality. It is opaque varies in color from
black to a brown/rusted shade. Many of the specimens display an olive brown to light reddish-brown
patina and/or cortex. This group is dominated by crude and angular debitage as a result of internal flaws
common to the hornfels material type. Specimen No. 2.131, a unifacial tool is the only formal tool
assigned to Group 1. The tool is black (10YR2/1) and made of a rounded cobble with a pronounced
sheen/gloss on its remnant cortex, possibly from use as a mano or extensive hand held usage. Based on
subtle color differences and uneven patinas within this raw material group, it appears unlikely that the
debitage came from a single core.

by more recent flake scars that are indicative of reutilizations of curated or recycled debitage by more
recent site inhabitants. Also present on several specimens is a water-worn, brown smooth cortex.

DISCUSSION
Data recovery excavations at sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 within the Del Rio Outer Loop provided
insight primarily into the Late Prehistoric use of the uplands in the San Felipe Creek watershed northeast
of Del Rio, Texas. Specifically, the archeological and geomorphological investigations, in conjunction
with various special analyses, provided data that form a picture, albeit incomplete, of prehistoric use of an
upland environment in the Lower Pecos cultural region. These data sets have been summarized and will
be used to explore the previously discussed research issues.
SITE FORMATION PROCESSES AND INTEGRITY OF THE CULTURAL DEPOSITS
What is the depositional history of sediments on 41VV2012 and 41VV2013? What is the integrity of the
sediments and how have they been impacted? Can discrete living surfaces be discerned?
Sediments at sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 are characterized by thin deposits of alluvium and
colluviums which overlay ancient Del Rio clay. A discontinuous veneer of eolian silt (Zone I) caps some
of the exposed surface deposits as well as a series of prehistoric (Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric) cultural
features which primarily occur on top of and, in select cases, are intrusive into the underlying silt and clay
colluviums. As discussed by Hall (see Appendix A), the primarily silt and clay matrix is reflective of the
texture of the Cretaceous aged bedrock which dominates the surrounding hill slopes and ridgelines.
An important soil horizon present at both sites is a dark gray A horizon paleosol (Zone II). This sterile
stratum occurs along the drainages that flow through both sites, as well as on the hill slopes of both sites,
and serves as a convenient chronological reference point. Interpreted as a cumulic A horizon soil formed
in a presumably moister tall grass, meadow-like environment; Zone II dates between 1250 BC and AD
1150 (3,200 and 800 BP). This well dated (seven AMS dates) and clearly defined Zone II stratum
predates all but one archeological feature (F 12/41VV2013) at sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013. The data
indicates that the main site deposits are younger, AD 1301–1670 (649–280 BP), than the underlying Zone
II paleosol or the older Zone III colluvium. The cultural features at both sites were surficial to shallowly
intrusive into Zones II and III, predominately younger than the underlying strata, and subjected to
multiple surface-related disturbances such as sheet-wash, scouring and bioturbation, as well as preconstruction vegetation clearing and scarification to a depth of approximately 18 inches below the ground
surface.
To what degree did the above disturbances alter the interpretive value (integrity) of the excavated data as
a whole? It is reasonable to presume that small light-weight artifacts (i.e., chipped-stone debitage,
ceramics sherds, and charcoal fragments) were horizontally displaced by wind and rain and moved down
slope via hundreds of years of weather. Additionally, larger cultural materials (i.e., FCR and formal
chipped-stone tools) could have been horizontally displaced by heavy rain-induced scouring, especially
when the hill slope site locations are taken into account. The degree of feature impact attributed to these
natural forces is often difficult to ascertain yet it is prudent to be aware of, and cautious in the
interpretation of, poorly provenienced data sets such as surficial diagnostics and charcoal samples
collected from excavation screens.

Natural site disturbance processes occurring within the study area can be roughly lumped into burrowing
activities attributed to badger and gopher sized animals down to insects and worms. Additionally, site
deposits with high clay contents, such as the Zone II paleosol and Zone III colluvium, are affected by soil
cracking which is a result of shrink-swell processes (argrillturbation). The cracks or fissures that open up
during the dry summer months can capture artifacts that fall in, especially during heavy rain events. Once
wet, the clay swells and seals the crack with the displaced artifacts located at a greater depth than its
original provenience.
Although not suspected as an agent of significant surface disturbances, soil creep was evident at site
41VV2012. During data recovery, Hall documented vertically oriented slabs of siltstone from the nearby
upland ridges exposed within the Zone III colluvium in BHT 9 (see Appendix A). Once exposed at the
surface, these slabs were purposely gathered by the prehistoric occupants and aligned in roughly ovate
configurations (see F 13, 18, and 19). Excavation of these features resulted in inconclusive evidence as to
their function. It is surmised that the slabs may have functioned as food preparation platforms associated
with adjacent thermal features.
The disturbance processes described above, when viewed as a whole, are believed to have displaced and
mixed artifacts, such as debitage, ash, charcoal, and FCR, from different site occupations and/or activity
areas on the sites. Additionally, worm, insect, and root pore bioturbation have blurred the interface
between the base of some features and the underlying non-cultural Zone II and Zone III strata. Moreover,
the sediments and soils on both sites have been subjected to horizontal and vertical disturbances from
modern land use (e.g., ranching) and the mechanical clearing of vegetation within the Del Rio Outer Loop
ROW followed by mechanical scarification (plowing) to loosen sediments within the cleared ROW prior
to roadway construction. The scarification process carved significant furrows across portions of both sites
to a depth of approximately 30 to 40 cm below ground surface. Ultimately, surface and subsurface
disturbances altered the provenience of most non-embedded artifacts and truncated the features down to
their basal levels. Given these conditions, it proved impossible to discern discrete living surfaces at either
41VV2012 or 41VV2103.
In conclusion, sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 represent palimpsests of cultural debris from repeat
occupations restricted to an eroded ground surface or within an unconsolidated eolian stratum in which
artifacts are subject to vertical and horizontal movement and random dispersal. In the absence of stratified
buried cultural deposits, discrete living surfaces proved to be impossible to isolate. However,
discontinuous pockets of intact, embedded feature remnants were capped and partially sealed beneath 2 10 cm of Zone I eolian silt. As described, multiple charcoal and feature matrix samples were collected
and only those from the most secure contexts (e.g., from the embedded feature core) were submitted for
analysis. Based on this discussion, it is believed that the radiocarbon assays and feature matrix data is
valid and generally obtained from secure contexts.
PALEOENVIRONMENT
What was the paleoenvironment like during the prehistoric occupations of sites 41VV2012 and
41VV2013? Were vegetation patterns similar to modern conditions?

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

According to Bryant and Holloway (1985: 39–40), past environmental conditions (paleoenvironment) for
the Lower Pecos region and Del Rio Outer Loop area are only generally understood. These data derive
from previous studies of fossil faunal remains and/or fossil pollen sequences preserved in dry
rockshelters, such as Bonfire Shelter (Bryant 1969), Eagle Cave (McAndrews and Larson 1966), and
Hinds Cave (Bryant 1977) in an area centered on the Devil’s and Pecos Rivers. Subsequent
paleoenvironmental studies, in conjunction with pollen data, utilized plant macrofossil data from
wood/pack rat (Neotoma sp.) middens and vertebrate fossils and geomorphological evidence (Toomey et
al. 1993), and, more recently (Russ et al. 2000), oxalate residue from lichen in archeological sites at
rockshelters and overhangs in Val Verde County to assist in the determination of past environmental
conditions.
Pollen data indicate that during the early Holocene dating between 8,050 BC and 5,050 BC (ca. 10,000 to
7,000 years BP), the climate was in a steady process of increasing aridity, generally resulting in an
increase of grasses and scrub species and a retreat of conifer/pine and juniper woodlands, and scrub
parklands established during the previous cooler and wetter glacial period dating between 20,550 BC and
8,050 BC (ca. 22,500 to 10,000 BP) (Russ et al. 2000:30). This hypothesis derives from pollen sequences
preserved in the deeply stratified deposits in Bonfire Shelter, Devil’s Mouth Site (Bryant and Larson
1966), Eagle Cave (McAndrews and Larson 1966), and Hinds Cave (Bryant 1977) (Bryant and Holloway
1985:52), as well as plant macrofossils from 16,000-year old wood/pack rat middens from the TransPecos (Bryant and Holloway 1985:47 citing Van Devender et al. 1978). By approximately 6,050 BC
(8,000 BP), xerophytic plants species, such as Agave (e.g., sotol and yucca) and prickly pear are well
represented in the pollen sequence from cultural contexts at Baker Cave and Hinds Cave, suggesting that
prehistoric groups exploited these resources (Bryant and Holloway 1985:56, citing Dering 1979).
Conditions similar to the modern climate and vegetation are believed established by approximately 6,050
BC (8,000 BP).
The gradual but steady trend toward increased aridity continued to current conditions except for a wetter
period around approximately 650 BC (2,600 BP). At that time, the pollen records from Bonfire Shelter
and Devil’s Mouth Site exhibit an increase in pine and grasses that suggest cooler and moister conditions
(Bryant and Holloway 1985:58). Though a more mesic period is acknowledged, its duration is debated.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) propose a relatively brief (less than 500 years) period while Toomey et al.
(1993) posit that the cooler and wetter conditions may have extended to approximately (AD 950) 1,000
BP (Russ et al. 2000 citing Toomey et al. 1993: Figure 4), a period of approximately 1,500 years (see
below).
Data recovery recovered no direct paleoenvironmental data; all comments concerning paleoenvironmental
conditions at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 derive from indirect evidence that required comparisons with
known data. Data collected during excavations on both sites germane to paleoenvironmental
reconstruction derive from Dr. Hall’s geomorphological study (including AMS dating of bulk soil
samples), the results of macrobotanical analyses by Phil Dering, and the limited pollen analysis performed
by Vaughn Bryant.

As explained in Dr. Hall’s geomorphological/geoarcheological study of 41VV012 and 41VV2013 (see
Appendix A), both sites contain a culturally sterile cumlic A horizon paleosol a maximum of 60 cm
thick. The paleosol is interpreted as developing between approximately 3,200 and 800 BP. This
interpretation is based on his analysis of the stable carbon isotope values from AMS samples recovered
from feature and non-feature contexts on 41VV2012 and 41VV2013, as well as bulk soil dates recovered
from backhoe trenches on both sites and analysis of a comparable paleosol (Copan paleosol) observed in
the Rio Grande valley in the El Paso and the Laredo areas with comparable dates. In order for the paleosol
to develop, a moister climate than modern conditions was necessary. The approximate age of the A
horizon paleosol and the need for wetter and presumably slightly cooler climate to foster the development
of the paleosol generally corresponds to the proposed mesic interlude for the Lower Pecos
region/southwest Texas from approximately 2,500 to 1,000 BP; the earlier and later dates proposed by Dr.
Hall may simply reflect local conditions where more effective moisture was available relative to the
generalized drying trend that continued after approximately 1,000 BP.
Under presumed wetter and cooler conditions, it is posited that the vegetation on the sites (given stable
carbon isotope values derived from the radiocarbon dates from both sites) consisted of savanna-like
grassland that covered not only the lower slopes of the sites, but also extended upslope away from the
unnamed tributaries of San Felipe Creek that drain both sites. This type of vegetation is classified as C3
plants, which thrive in moister climatic regimes in contrast to C4 species. Under such conditions, it is
presumed that the riparian vegetation along the tributaries and San Felipe Creek was more robust and
larger during the site occupations that date to the AD 1300 to 1600 period.
The recovery of predominately mesquite charcoal, from the feature matrix of the majority of excavated
features, indicates that the species was readily available on, or immediately adjacent to, 41VV2012 and
41VV2013. Other species identified as fuel wood in the excavated features include xerophytic ocotillo,
guayacan, and an unidentified Acacia sp., all of which are today primarily upland species and quite
common. These data support the dry semiarid (savanna-like) environment proposed by previous
paleoenvironmental studies for the middle and late Holocene. The results of Dr. Dering’s macrobotanical
analysis also indicates that the riparian zones along the drainages on both sites (as well as the nearby San
Felipe Creek) supported oak, pecan, persimmon, and sycamore/cottonwood, and willow, which are all
important resources not only for fuel wood (e.g., oak, pecan, sycamore/cottonwood, etc.) for cooking and
heating, but also for their associated food resources (e.g., pecans, hackberries, sugarberries, etc.).
Dr. Bryant’s limited pollen study on several soil samples from feature and non-feature contexts on
41VV2013 is relatively inconclusive with regards to paleoenvironmental conditions though there appears
to be some parallels to the trends suggested by the geomorphological study (see Appendix A). For
example, one of the top five pollen varieties identified by Bryant in the samples from 41VV2013 is
Poaceae (grass), which corresponds well with the C3 plant community described above. Two additional
pollen types in the top five varieties identified include Cheno-Am and Ephedra, both of which may be
found in hot and dry conditions similar to the semi-arid savanna-like environment suggested by Hall (see
Appendix A). However, the top five represented pollen varieties represent those types that are the most
durable and therefore are over represented in the samples.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

In conclusion, the prehistoric occupants of 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 navigated semiarid savanna-like
upland grassland with robust riparian zones. It is postulated that the development of the A horizon
paleosol on both sites corresponds to a generally more mesic and likely cooler environment, which in turn
corresponds to the generalized trends for the Lower Pecos region as a whole from approximately 550 BC
to AD 950 (2,500 to 1,000 BP). Although there is some difference (e.g., 3,200 to 800 BP or 2,500 to
1,000 BP) between Dr. Hall’s postulated depositional period for the paleosol and the overarching regional
climate data, it seems reasonable to presume that this reflects localized (e.g., 41VV2012 and 41VV2013)
conditions that may have lasted slightly longer than the overarching regional trend and/or reflects the
vagaries of sampling during the previous paleoenvironmental studies; the paleoenvironmental picture
remains generalized and relatively large scale.
CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
What are the ages of the features and do they provide radiocarbon evidence of multiple uses? What are
the corresponding regional chronological construct. Do the artifact assemblages from both sites
primarily reflect Lower Pecos traits or are they more comparable to traits from the adjacent western
Edwards Plateau, eastern Trans-Pecos, or South Texas region, or do the assemblages reflect an
admixture of traits from these regions? What cultural affiliations, if any, can be hypothesized?
A primary goal of data recovery at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 was to establish a chronology of site
occupation, place the occupations within their regional context, and examine possible cultural affiliations.
It was hoped that comparisons among stratigraphic zones identified during excavations and associated
radiocarbon dates and temporal diagnostics would offer a refined occupational chronology. However,
given the depositional context of both sites, no true cultural zones could be defined, much less correlated
with radiocarbon dates and temporal diagnostics.
Feature-focused data recovery discovered no stratified cultural deposits or zones, which ultimately
precluded detection of discrete living surfaces associated with temporal diagnostics and radiocarbon
dates. How then to recognize potential multiple site occupations and the re-use of features through time?
Multiple charcoal samples from good contexts from as many features as possible were collected and
submitted for AMS processing to discern not only the age of a feature but whether or not a given feature
experienced multiple uses. B&A archeologists submitted 20 charcoal samples to construct, in tandem
with recovered temporally diagnostic artifacts, a chronology of site use. Baseline constructs of the major
regional periods and subperiods are taken from Turpin (2004).
Absolute Dating
Based on the AMS processing of 20 charcoal samples from 10 features (F 14, 17, and 20 on 41VV2012
and F 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 15 on 41VV2013), site deposition within the ROW at these sites primarily
occurred from AD 1301 to 1670 (Late Prehistoric through Protohistoric/early Historic occupations). A
single feature (F 12) on 41VV2013 did, however, produce three date ranges spanning a 366-year period
(ca. AD 53 to 419) during the Transitional Archaic. Radiometric data obtained from 41VV2013 presents a
somewhat more complex chronological picture then that for 41VV2012. In general, the dated features on

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

155

41VV2013 are generally younger than the dated ones from 41VV2012, though one feature (F 12) on
41VV2103 produced three 2-sigma calibrated date ranges falling between AD 53 and 419 (see below).
41VV2012
The three dated features (F 14, 17, and 20) on 41VV2012 were utilized during the AD 1301–1448 period.
Two charcoal samples recovered from 98.95–98.93 m and at 98.89 m during Level 4 excavations of
Feature 14 produced comparable 2-sigma calibrated date ranges of AD 1398–1448 and AD 1393–1443.
Those dates suggest a single use of the feature. However, it is possible that the feature was used more
than once but the sampling was skewed because the charcoal obtained from the separate elevations may
actually have originated from a single larger charcoal fragment from the same burning event that has
since degraded into smaller vertically translocated pieces. Charcoal recovered from 98.50–98.40 m (Level
3, EU2) during Feature 17 excavations produced a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 1391 to 1440 that
is almost identical to Feature 14. In contrast to Features 14 and 17, charcoal recovered from 98.45–98.40
m (Level 3, EU 2) during investigations of Feature 20 generated a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD
1301 to 1367. In conclusion, the chronometric data suggests that Feature 20 was approximately 30 years
older than Feature 14 and 17, which appear contemporaneous.
41VV2013
Data recovery at 41VV21013 excavated a total of nine thermal features (F 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and
15). Through the recovery of carbonaceous matrix from Features 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 15, investigations
determined that Feature 12 dates to AD 247 to 419, while the ages of Features 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 15 fall
within a 262-year span (ca. AD 1408 to 1670) of the Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric periods. From this
inventory of Late Prehistoric to Protohistoric features (F 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 15) three yielded
correspondingly tight date ranges: Feature 1 (AD 1489 to 1635), Feature 5 (AD 1489-1603) and Feature 8
(A.D. 1487-1635) that strongly suggest that they were contemporaneous. Features 10 and 14 contained no
carbonaceous matrix and are, therefore, undated.
Six of seven dated features on 41VV2013 produced radiocarbon assays dating to the 262-year period
between AD 1408 and 1670. Feature 1 produced three 2-sigma calibrated date ranges that suggest
multiple feature use between AD 1489 and 1635. Two dates (Beta 292974 and Beta 292975) obtained
from the excavation of Level 2 in EUs 1 and 2 (100.50 m and 100.52 m, respectively), are essentially
identical (ca. AD 1492 to 1602 and AD 1489 to 1603). In contrast, the third date from an elevation of
100.58 m (Level 1, EU 1) produced an overlapping but slightly younger date range of AD 1537 to 1635
(0.57, highest relative area under distribution). Though there is overlap in the three dates, these data
suggest that Feature 1 may have been utilized more than once with the overlapping dates reflecting a
mixture of charcoal from the separate events.
Other features on 41VV2013 with comparable dates include Feature 5 that produced a single charcoal
sample that yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 1489 to 1603 and Feature 8 (AD 1487 to
1604), though this feature also produced three identical date ranges from three additional charcoal
samples).

156

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

A single radiocarbon sample (Beta 292976) from Feature 3 yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD
1447 to 1527, which is identical to the date range of Beta 292964 recovered from Feature 15 at an
elevation of 100.30–100.25 m (Level 2) in EU 2. Similar to Feature 8, Feature 15 yielded additional dates
from additional charcoal samples (see below). It appears that Feature 3 was utilized once.
Four separate charcoal samples were collected from Feature 8 that produced two date ranges; three
samples (Beta 292969, Beta 292971, and Beta 92972) from elevations between 99.60 m and 99.40 m
(Levels 3 and 4, EU 2) yielded identical 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 1537 to 1635. Curiously, a
fourth sample (Beta 292967) from an elevation of 99.74 m (Level 1) in EU 1 produced a date range of
AD 1487 to 1604. At least two uses of Feature 8 are likely reflected in these dates, with the charcoal
associated with Beta 292967 possibly representing charcoal that was contaminated/mixed with clean out
debris from the feature’s earliest use between AD 1537 and 1635. As mentioned, the AD 1487 to 1604
date range from Level 1 (EU 1) in Feature 8 is essentially the same as the proposed earliest use of Feature
1 between AD 1489 and 1603.
Feature 12 on 41VV2013 represents the oldest feature excavated during data recovery. Three charcoal
samples collected from 99.40–99.30 m (Level 2) in EUs 2 and 3 provided 2-sigma calibrated dates falling
between AD 53 and 419 (Transitional Archaic/Blue Hills sub-period). However, one sample (Beta
292979) recovered at 99.33–99.30 m (EU 3, Level 2) provided insufficient carbon for a measured
radiocarbon age, though a conventional radiocarbon age of 1,850±50 BP was obtained that provided a 2sigma calibrated date range of AD 53 to 259. The additional radiocarbon sample (Beta 292977) retrieved
from 99.40–99.30 (Level 2) in EU 3 yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 136 to 266, which
overlaps with part of the AD 53 to 259 date range for Beta 292979.
The third radiocarbon assay (Beta 292978) for this feature originated from EU 2, Level 2 (99.40–99.30
m) and produced a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 247 to 419. Unfortunately, the three charcoal
samples retrieved from Feature 12 excavations were general level collections and not discrete pointplotted samples. Regardless, the feature was utilized sometime between AD 53 and 419, and was likely
used more than once. The mixing of charcoal from two or three events (combined with the old wood
issue) could explain the ambiguities among these dates. Feature 12 was the only Transitional Archaic
feature excavated, though that is not to imply that some of the features not recommended for excavation
did not date to the same period.
A single radiocarbon sample (Beta 292973) from Feature 13 yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of
AD 1619 to 1670. The charcoal for this date was recovered in EU 2, Level 2 (100.12–100.00 m).
Three charcoal samples were collected from Feature 15 during the excavation of Level 2 (100.30–100.20
m) in EU 2. A point-plotted charcoal fragment recovered at 100.24 m and submitted for AMS processing
(Beta 292968) yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of AD 1470 to 1639. Curiously, the two additional
charcoal samples retrieved from more general elevations in Level 2 exhibit tighter time spans (i.e., AD
1447 to 1527 [Beta 292964] and AD 1408 to 1451 [Beta 292965]) than the point-plotted sample (see
Table 10). Multiple uses of Feature 15, as well as the influence of old wood, are suspected given the
characteristics of the date ranges.

Relative Dating
Temporally diagnostic artifacts collected during data recovery from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 primarily
date to the Transitional Archaic (ca. 200 BC to AD 600) and Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric (ca. AD 600 to
1700) periods. The exceptions are a Middle Archaic (ca. 2500 BC to 1000 BC) Langtry dart point and a
Middle Archaic Almagre dart point recovered from 41VV2013.
The Ensor, Frio, and Figueroa Transitional Archaic projectile points (primarily recovered from
41VV2013) collected during data recovery are typical of the region, as well as for the Central Texas and
eastern Trans-Pecos regions. The presence of such types amidst an inventory of features primarily dating
to the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric may represent multi-component occupations or these types may
represent tools curated by the sites’ Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric occupants from other locations and
subsequently introduced to, and used and discarded (or lost) on the sites. It is possible that the areas of
both sites that extend beyond the APE onto private property (and could not, therefore, be investigated)
contain additional Transitional Archaic components and may have served as a source for the reworked
Ensor, Frio, and Figueroa specimens.
Unfortunately, none of the temporally diagnostic projectile points or the majority (83.3%) of the ceramics
discovered during data recovery came from subsurface contexts. With only one feature dating to the
Transitional Archaic along with the recovery of a single Langtry dart point and several Transitional
Archaic specimens, it is impossible to determine whether these are representative of a multi-component
occupation with retooling/discard or artifacts curated by Late Prehistoric and/or Protohistoric occupants.
The artifact may have been brought into the site or picked up on other parts of 41VV2012 and 41VV2013
that extend beyond the ROW. There is only limited radiocarbon data from 41VV2013 indicating any
Archaic use of the site and none from 41VV2012.
Summary
The available AMS dates for 41VV2012 obtained from Features 14 and 17 range from AD 1300 to 1440.
In contrast, 41VV2013 returned a suite of 2-sigma calibrated dates ranging from AD 1410 to 1670 (e.g.,
Features 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 15), while three dates from Feature 12 range from AD 60 to 420. Given these
data, prehistoric use of the excavated thermal features on 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 primarily occurred
from the mid- to late (e.g., AD 1300 to 1600) Late Prehistoric period (ca. AD 700 to 1700), through the
Protohistoric Period around AD 1500, and into the early (e.g., AD 1600 to 1670) part of the Historic
Period (ca. AD 1600 +).
The clustering of dates for Features 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 15 during this roughly 300 to 400-year span is in
striking contrast to the three dates (AD 60 to 260 and AD 300 to 310 [Beta Sample 292979], AD 140 to
330 [Beta Sample 292977], and AD 240 to 420 [Beta Sample 292978]) from Feature 12 that link it to the
Transitional Archaic (ca. 300 BC to AD 700). Regionally, the above Transitional Archaic through Late
Prehistoric/Protohistoric use of the features at both sites corresponds to the Blue Hills and early Flecha
subperiods, respectively.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

SUBSISTENCE
What activities occurred at the features? What was being processed? What fuel wood was utilized and is
there evidence that one variety was preferred? Were subsistence pursuits dictating when and where
people aggregated? Was the acquisition of other resources, such as quality lithic material, embedded in
the food quest? Or was the acquisition of other kinds of resources the overarching priority that influenced
the settlement pattern of these communities?
Evidence of subsistence activities and the types of edible resources gathered and utilized is limited at
41VV2012 and 41VV2013 due to a relative sparseness of excavated artifacts and a virtual lack of faunal
remains. The pollen analysis conducted by Bryant (see Appendix E) is inconclusive, as the pollen that
was identifiable was poorly preserved/degraded, low in numbers, and represented the more durable types
of pollen most frequently found where oxidation has degraded much of the organic contents, including
many pollen types. Bryant’s study (see Appendix E) does not suggest that any of the identified pollen
taxa represent economic resources resulting from intentional collection.
Fortunately, the botanical assemblages recovered through flotation are robust enough to illicit some
general patterns. Excavation of five features at 41VV2012 and nine features at 41VV2013 yielded 0.7
gram and 18.5 grams, respectively, of charred plant remains from a total of 91.3 liters of floated feature
matrix (see Appendix D). In addition, a total of 5.0 grams of macrobotanical samples (wood charcoal)
were also analyzed. It is likely that the procurement and utilization of these plant remains played an
important role in the timing and duration of the site’s occupation.
Charred plant remains identified from 41VV2012 consist of mesquite/acacia and an indeterminate type.
No plants of economic importance were recovered. Wood charcoal analysis identified six pieces of oak as
well as 17 pieces of mesquite charcoal. While the dominant presence of mesquite is not surprising given
presumed paleoenvironmental conditions and the upland site context, the additional presence of oak wood
suggests a preference for long burning fuel woods as would be expected in thermal features such as
hearths and earth ovens. Excavations at 41VV2013 recovered charred plant remains from 12 different
wood taxa, six types of edible plant remains, and three types of wood charcoal (mesquite/acacia, oak, and
condalia/javalina bush). The 12 identified wood types, in order of prevalence, consist of mesquite/acacia,
oak, Texas persimmon, granjeno, condalia/javalina bush, sycamore, pecan, elbowbush, cottonwood/
willow, mesquite, ocotillo, and guayacan. As discussed by Dering (see Appendix D), the pecan,
sycamore, oak, and cottonwood/willow currently grow on the terraces of San Felipe Creek while the
remaining taxa occur on the xeric uplands; similar distributions are proposed for the dates of site
occupation (i.e., Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric to early Historic periods).
Based on recovered data, it is evident that the majority of features located on both sites were thermal
features utilized as hearths, open-air griddles and earth ovens presumably focused on the processing of
plant resources based on the lack of prehistoric faunal remains. Preferred fuel wood was mesquite and oak
with condalia/javelina bush possibly serving as kindling. The presence of a variety of upland shrubs such
as ocotillo, guayacan, and elbowbush may also indicate fuel woods burned for light and/or kindling but
not food processing given their fast burn time relative to the long-burning mesquite and oak that form hot
coals suitable for grilling, roasting, searing, and/or steaming.

Potential foodstuffs consumed on site consist of onions, mesquite pods, prickly pear fruit, and pecan nuts
that were possibly supplemented by granjeno and sugarberry nutlets. Due to the very limited sample size
(single specimen) of the granjeno, mesquite pod, and sugarberry, these should be considered as
speculative. No traces of sotol or lechuguilla bulbs were identified during Dr. Dering’s analyses. The lack
of faunal remains encountered during excavations precludes any conclusive statements regarding such
subsistence resources. That is not to say game was not processed and consumed on site but only that there
is no evidence for such activities. With this in mind, it is believed that the site occupants gathered
immediately available rocks and adjacent or nearby (i.e., along the riparian zone of San Felipe Creek
and/or the unnamed tributary of San Felipe Creek that flows through both sites) firewood and plant
resources that in turn were burned and processed, respectively, in the thermal features on both sites.
In terms of what activities occurred around the features in addition to plant processing, the data is
relatively inconclusive. Based on the relatively low numbers of debitage, cores, and lithic tools recovered
from contexts adjacent to each feature (i.e., those recovered from the Drop and Toss Zones), limited lithic
reduction presumably occurred within proximity to most of the features. At 41VV2012, Features 14 and
17 (hearth and earth oven, respectively) occur within several meters of three unusual unburned sandstoneslab alignments (Features 13, 18, and 19) interpreted as potential food preparation/presentation platforms.
Although speculative, the spatial association of both feature types is intriguing with regards to possible
functional relationships
In contrast to 41VV2012, only thermal features were discovered at 41VV2013. Central to 41VV2013 is
Locus A, a 30 x 27 m area of ashy midden-like soil with a relatively dense concentration of artifacts
amidst a cluster of five features (see Figure 17). Investigations recovered a total of 151 surface artifacts
from this discrete activity area that consist of chipped-stone debitage, cores, projectile points, bifaces, and
groundstone. Based on the distribution of mapped surface artifacts from Locus A, it appears that the
activity area represents the main occupation area where the majority of the Late Prehistoric to early
Historic cooking and lithic reduction activities occurred.
Based on the low sample numbers and inherent bias presented by such data, the seasonality of the site
occupations is highly speculative. Dering (see Appendix D) mentions that onion bulbs would have been
gathered and processed in the spring, prickly pear fruits in midsummer, and pecans in the fall. The
pronounced absence of faunal materials, especially deer bone, suggests that the site was mainly a series of
spring to fall occupations of short duration with utilization of the upland xeric plant communities as well
as the more mesic stream terraces.
LITHIC RESOURCE PROCUREMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
Do the assemblages of chipped-stone and non-chipped stone artifacts recovered from 41VV2012 and
41VV2013 provide insight into lithic resource procurement? Is the lithic raw material local or non-local
(i.e., originating from outside the project area) and from what type of source (i.e., in situ or fluvial
gravel) are the raw materials originating? Do the debitage assemblages from both sites reflect any
diachronic (time-specific) or general synchronic patterns that elucidate technological adaptations or
structure?

160

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Archeological investigations at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 yielded only minor information relative to
lithic resource procurement and technology, especially in terms of specific stone sources utilized and
technological change over time. A major hindrance was a lack of clearly separate components, a general
paucity of artifacts from undisturbed contexts, and a lack of discrete living surfaces and stratified cultural
zones. Regardless, there is some evidence of area-wide lithic exploitation and possible curation recycling
of predominantly Transitional Archaic dart points by the Late Prehistoric occupants of both sites.
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that these dart points (primarily Ensor and Frio types), most of which
(57%) exhibit extensive re-sharpening and alternatively beveled stems, were intended to take the place of
alternately beveled knives associated with the classic Toyah toolkit associated with the late Prehistoric
throughout Central Texas, including the western margins of the Edwards Plateau near the Del Rio area.
Review of the Geological Atlas of Texas (Del Rio Sheet, Barnes 1977) indicates that sources of toolquality knappable chert, quartzite, and igneous rock occur within a kilometer of both sites. Mapped
outcrops of the Cretaceous aged, chert-bearing Salmon Peak Limestone (Ksa) and Pliocene-Pleistocene
Uvalde Gravel (T-Qu) straddle both sites. Additionally the Rio Grande and its prolific gravel bars occur
approximately 14 kilometers southwest of the study area. Clearly, sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 were
strategically located amidst readily available lithic raw materials.
Lithic artifacts recovered from sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 provide opportunities to examine raw
material types and determine whether they originated from a bedrock outcrop or fluvial gravel deposit
(via cortex analysis). Because there was no available raw material comparative collection from the area
and region, sourcing data is limited to determinations of bedrock outcrops and fluvial gravels. Such an
analysis serves to indirectly address the issue of mobility and lithic raw material procurement.
Additionally, the presence/absence of thermal modification and extent of platform preparation provide
insight into the basic toolkit and lithic reduction strategy utilized by the primarily Late Prehistoric
occupants of both sites. As only 12 pieces of chipped stone and one groundstone artifact were recovered
from 41VV2012, the assemblage is considered too small to warrant further discussion other than that
already provided within the Material Culture Section. The following discussion, therefore, focuses on
41VV2013.
Examination of 368 lithic artifacts (debitage and tools) recovered from 41VV2013 revealed that 93% of
the assemblage consists of cherts, 5% is black hornfels, while the remainder of the assemblage consists of
fine grained limestone (n=5), quartzite (n=1) and chalcedony (n=1). It is likely that these were materials
procured locally from either bedrock outcrops or fluvial gravels (i.e., Uvalde Gravels or gravels from the
Rio Grande) and do not contain raw materials from distant sources, such as obsidian, Alibates from North
Texas, and Georgetown chert from Central Texas. Smooth cortex is interpreted as indicative of fluvial
gravel origin while the coarse cortex reflects an upland bedrock origin. Analysis of 93 recovered corticate
artifacts (debitage and lithic tools) revealed that 86% (n=80) have a smooth to polished cortex and 14%
(n=13) retain a coarse chalky cortex.
Based on the above data, the occupants of 41VV2013 were primarily exploiting the nearby fluvial gravel
deposits. The collection of raw material could have occurred randomly/fortuitously as material was
encountered and/or preferred locales along local drainages or amidst an upland exposure of Uvalde

Gravels (possibly as an embedded task performed during hunting or collecting forays) as the site
occupants moved across the landscape. An examination of the lithic artifacts recovered from 41VV2013
reveals that the majority of the recovered cores are extensively fragmented or depleted and that utilized
and edge modified debitage are well represented within the overall assemblage. This reflects a lack of
readily available lithic raw material on site and a preference for expedient tools with sharp edges, such as
would be used for cutting plant material. Platforms were analyzed on the 292 debitage specimens
recovered during excavations and surface collection at 41VV2013, of which 166 specimens (56.8%)
retained a platform or platform remnant.
Platform analysis of the 166 specimens reveals 76 (45.8%) single-faceted platforms, 31 (18.7%) platforms
with multiple facets, 13 (7.8%) ground platforms, 14 (8.4%) platforms with cortex present and 32 (19.3%)
are crushed. Thus, of the intact platforms, 134 (80.7%) are unprepared (i.e., single facet and cortex) and
32 (19.3%) are prepared (i.e., multifaceted and ground). The relatively low percentage of platform
preparation reflects a generally low incidence of bifacial reduction/biface manufacture, which is attributed
to the predominate use of expedient flake tools struck from unprepared cores. This may also be a
reflection of the varied abundance of suitable raw material located throughout the area (that is,
conservation of lithic raw material was not a paramount concern). Additionally, thermal alteration was
present in 9% of all recovered chipped stone artifacts from 41VV2013. Projectile points (25%), cores
(18.5%), and edge modified debitage were the most often thermally modified artifact classes, presumably
to facilitate reduction.
As previously described, seven (78%) of nine Archaic dart points exhibit evidence of extensive resharpening and re-curvature. Of these, four specimens (Specimens 6.133, 14.149, 130.186, and
171.MS.P1) were extensively alternately beveled and likely reused as hafted knives. Based on locational
data, if the mostly Transitional Archaic dart points (two Ensor, one Frio, and one Figueroa) were curated,
it is speculated that the curation/reutilization occurred during the Late Prehistoric period between A.D.
1408 and 1670. It is hypothesized that these recycled dart points, as well as three edge-modified blade
flakes (Specimens 130.200, 168.202, and 171.MS.F1) served as substitutes for alternately beveled knives
present in the classic Toyah toolkit. In the absence of a comparative collection of raw material from
known local and regional lithic sources, the issue of mobility and lithic raw material procurement is
relatively inconclusive.
SITE STRUCTURE AND SPATIAL PATTERNS
Is there a pattern to the arrangement/locations of the excavated features at both sites? If there are
patterns, do they reflect changes through time? Do any of the targeted features have discrete associated
activity areas? If present, what do they imply about site structure? Exclusive of the targeted cultural
features, are there patterns in artifact distribution across both sites? If so, what do the patterns suggest
about activities that occurred there?
The structure and organization of archeological features and deposits is critical to understanding the
cultural activities that occurred on a particular site. At sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013, a lack of complete
site access coupled with typically disturbed surface deposition limited the interpretive value of the spatial
patterns of artifacts in relation to features. However, the data presented herein is based primarily on what
162

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

in-situ feature deposits were uncovered and does provide a basic understanding of the site’s environment
and its influence on the occupations.
41VV2012
At 41VV2012 a total of 20 archeological features were documented within the survey corridor; of these,
five were excavated (see Figure 6). The 15 non-investigated features were considered too eroded and
displaced to warrant further documentation beyond the survey level (Young et al. 2010). However, review
of the feature locations indicates two distinct feature clusters: one each at the northern and southern
feature boundaries. No features were excavated within the southern cluster of eight features due to a lack
of integrity. Of the 12 features located along the more elevated northern cluster of features, five were
investigated. These five features included three sandstone slab alignments (F 13, 18, and 19), one
hearth/griddle (F 14), and a small earth oven (F 17).
As previously discussed a physical and functional association between the slab alignments and adjacent
thermal features is suggested. It is hypothesized that the unburned slabs represent food preparation
platforms utilized in conjunction with the adjacent hearth-griddle (F 14) and earth oven (F 13) features.
Topographically, the northern feature cluster (see Figure 6) is situated along a sloping bench-like flat
located on the flanks of a long east-west trending ridge. This elevated location would have helped to
dissipate smoke from the active thermal features as well as provide a readily available supply of naturally
occurring slabs re-deposited at this locale via pronounced soil creep, as described by Hall (see Appendix
A).
A total of four AMS radiocarbon assays were run on two (F 14 and F 17) of the five features. Feature 14
(Beta 292961) was dated to AD 1398-1448 (502-552 B.P) and Feature 17 (Beta 292962) was dated to AD
1391-1440 (510-559 B.P). Unfortunately excavation of three of the slab alignments yielded no datable
feature deposits. Based on very similar surficial and topographic locations it is suggestive that the five
features are contemporaneous and represent purposely placed cooking features with their associated food
preparation platforms. Given a lack of additional chronometric data, stratified cultural deposits, or
discrete living surfaces the issue of changes through time remains inconclusive.
41VV2013
At 41VV2013, initial survey investigations discovered 32 thermal features. Those features consisted of
six hearths (F 2, 3, 5, 10, 19, and 22), two small earth ovens (F 1 and 12), two FCR pavements (F 8 and
14), two FCR clusters (F 10 and 15) and a single FCR scatter (F 13). From this inventory, nine features (F
1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15) exhibiting the best integrity were excavated. Figure 18 depicts the
feature locations within the study corridor. Located along the eastern flank of the most elevated point
within the general site location is Locus A, which represents the main activity area within the sample of
41VV2013 that overlapped with the Del Rio Outer Loop.
Locus A consists of a loosely spaced cluster of nine thermal features (F 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, and 15) located
within an approximately 30 x 27 m area. Of these nine features, seven (F 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, and 15) were
excavated based on their relative degree of intactness. Surrounding Locus A is a widely scattered band of
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

163

mostly displaced, non-excavated features. Based on 16 AMS radiocarbon assays from seven excavated
features, the main site occupation in Locus A occurred during a 262 year span (ca. A.D. 1408 to 1670)
during the Late Prehistoric period. The lone exception is Feature 12, which dates to the Transitional
Archaic (A.D. 247- 419). Interestingly, F 12 was located down slope from Locus A amongst a cluster of
three features (F 9, 10, and 12). Additionally, two Transitional Archaic (200 B.C.-A.D.600) Frio dart
points were recovered within 6 m of Feature 12, suggesting a possible earlier Transitional Archaic
occupation focused on the lower elevations of the site.
Based on the above referenced data, it is apparent that a fairly intensive yet intermittent Late Prehistoric
occupation at 41VV2013 occurred over at least a 262 year period. Temporally diagnostic artifacts from
this period consist of three Perdiz arrow points/fragments and six ceramic sherds. Due to the surface
disturbances and the deflated Pleistocene ground surface, no intact living surfaces were discernible.
Although, it was readily apparent that the midden-like dark ashy matrix of Locus A represents the
primary Late Prehistoric activity area within the study area where limited lithic reduction and
maintenance of lithic artifacts occurred. While the Transitional Archaic projectile points could represent
multiple occupations, the presence of four alternately beveled Ensor projectiles within Locus A suggests
that the Late Prehistoric occupants were recycling/curating Transitional Archaic projectiles and reutilizing
them as knives in the processing of plant materials which were presumably cooked within the surrounding
thermal features of Locus A.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Given the relatively sparse assemblage of artifacts and the disturbed site conditions, limited data is
available from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 to answer questions regarding prehistoric mobility, resource
procurement, lithic technology, and subsistence adaptations. To answer such questions, particularly the
research issues and questions posed for this study that concern changes through time, a site must possess
a robust artifact assemblage sufficient to provide a viable sample, cultural features containing sufficient
macrobotanical remains, and discrete living surfaces with isolable components. Ideally, such deposits
would be stratified. The sample of sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 located within the proposed Del Rio
Outer Loop ROW possessed no such deposits; thus, inferences based on the available data must suffice.
Based on the geoarcheological assessment and observations, the cultural material at 41VV2012 and
41VV2013 was originally deposited during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric on a deflated
Pleistocene surface or atop a discontinuous cumulic A horizon that developed between approximately
3,200 and 800 BP (Holocene). A Mid- to Late Holocene discontinuous eolian veneer subsequently
developed across the sites burying some artifacts and cultural features. It is unclear how many cycles of
eolian deposition/erosion have occurred. Cultural material was not buried in the A horizon, though several
features were intrusive into the paleosol. The cultural deposits at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 were
essentially surficial and lacked temporal diagnostics in direct association with the dated features. Under
such conditions, it is virtually impossible to determine functional and/or temporal associations among
artifacts and features.
The lithic dominated artifact assemblage from both sites reflects a stone industry geared toward expedient
tool manufacture and use, though select chipped-stone tools, such as projectile points and bifaces, indicate
that some formal tool manufacture and curation (whether from another part of the site or another site
altogether) also occurred. The preponderance of expedient tools (utilized and modified flakes) from both
sites suggests that site occupation was short term, such as for a specific task like plant processing.
Similarly, the limited variety and size of the thermal features on both sites intimates that both were not
residential camps where one would expect a wider variety of feature types (i.e., middens, storage features,
and structural remains) and sizes attributable to more intensive long term occupations.
The samples from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 afford limited datasets from which to reconstruct the
reduction trajectory and reduction technology utilized by the sites’ occupants. Simply based on the
proportions of decorticate debitage and core fragments, primary reduction was not occurring on either
site. The initial decortification of raw material presumably occurred at the sources or at intermediary
locations away from the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW including the potions of each site within the
ROW, as no lithic procurement sites were discovered during SWCA’s [Galindo and Chavez 2006a and
2006b] intensive survey of the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW.
Reduction technology appears to have been focused on unprepared cores, be they unidirectional,
bidirectional or multidirectional specimens. Small core fragments and depleted cores make up 96% of the
core assemblage, which is negative for blade cores or prepared cores, thus indicating a lack of readily
available raw lithic material on site. Only a relatively few bifaces and biface fragments were recovered

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

165

during excavations, so it would appear that biface manufacture was not an extensive practice on
41VV2012 and 41VV2013. In support of this is the low incidence of bifacial reduction, exemplified by
the low recovery of thinning flakes. This is consistent with the relative proportion of expedient and
curated/reutilized tools to the lithic assemblage in general. Additionally, the curation and extensive
alternate beveling of a number of Late Archaic dart points suggests that the Late Prehistoric occupants
recycled these points specifically for use as knives.
Another line of evidence, supporting the limited occurrence of late bifacial thinning and formal tool
manufacture on 41VV2013, is the conspicuous paucity of microdebitage associated with edge resharpening and/or final biface thinning. A 25% sample of soil from all feature excavation blocks and
100% of the soil removed from the stratified random Control Units was screened through 1/8-inch
hardware cloth for the recovery of microdebitage. The recovery of microdebitage was almost nonexistent. Clearly, final chipped-stone tool reduction/thinning was not a common occurrence in and around
the excavated features or in non-feature areas.
In the absence of a comparative lithic raw material collection, conclusions concerning lithic raw material
procurement, such as determining whether formal tools such as projectile points were manufactured with
a relatively higher quality lithic material, are limited to what could be gleaned from available local
geologic data, an examination of cortex characteristics to determine fluvial or bedrock origin, and an
intra-assemblage comparison of raw materials across tool types. Answers to these questions are
complicated given the close proximity of deposits of Uvalde gravels, which contain ample siliceous (i.e.,
chert, petrified wood, and igneous materials) raw materials and chert-bearing limestone formations to the
north, east, and west of the sites. Ultimately, all that can be surmised is that the Toyah or Toyah-like
groups utilizing 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 predominantly exploited the readily available local gravel and
lithic bedrock raw materials and curated Archaic-aged dart points, brought in from unknown locales,
which were manufactured with higher quality cherts. Undoubtedly specific bedrock outcrops and gravel
exposures were preferred and revisited but cannot be confirmed at this time. To answer such questions
would require locating local lithic procurement sites and an extensive lithic raw material study for
sourcing at the local and regional levels.
The issues of mobility and resource procurement are also problematic. We can presume that the groups
utilizing 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 were highly mobile based on previous local and regional studies, and
analogy from previous ethnographic research on the world’s known hunter-gatherer populations. The
collector-forager rubric explored by Kelly (1995) represents a theoretical continuum along which mobile
peoples function in terms of mobility and resource procurement. Collectors tend to move residentially to
resource areas while foragers tend to utilize logistical forays from residential sites to map onto resources.
In terms of foragers, logistical camps may be utilized for several days while a given resource (i.e., game
or plant resources) is acquired, field processed, and transported back to the residential camp, which itself
will be relocated several times annually. Where, however, in terms of the collector-forager continuum
described by Kelly (1995) do the occupants of these sites belong? B&A hypothesizes that the prehistoric
inhabitants that utilized 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 were foragers based on the assembled tool kit, which
according to Kuhn (1994:426) can be described as a “mobile tool kit” designed to provide a maximum of
utility with a minimum of weight. Additionally, a mobile tool kit would consist of a low number of small

166

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

finished tools, many of which would exhibit increased durability and multi-functionality. As defined
herein, a mobile toolkit refers to artifacts that are kept with the individual a majority of the time and
subject to almost continuous transportation costs.
The frequency of expediently manufactured tools (edge-modified and utilized debitage, incomplete
bifaces with use-wear, etc.) coupled with curated/reutilized tools (projectile points/knives) supports the
forager pathway. At 41VV2012, other mobility indicators include the high percentage of depleted and
fragmented cores and the lack of hammerstones and microdebitage, in general. Taken together, these
indirect lines of evidence suggest an outward bound, small group of foragers utilizing a repeatedly
occupied, strategically positioned, short term stop over camp.
Given the sparse artifact recovery and limited feature data recovered from 41VV2012, little can be said
about mobility and resource procurement for this site. As mentioned above, presumably the occupants of
41VV2012 were likely foragers, with the site representing a stopover between a residential camp and a
resource extraction locale (e.g., plant collection area). The few radiocarbon dates obtained from
41VV2012 do not suggest extensive, long term repeated use of the excavated features nor were any
primary activity areas identified during the survey and data recovery field work. Unlike site 41VV2013,
which contained a cluster of cultural features (e.g., Locus A) yielding evidence of multiple uses and a
concentration of surface artifacts, site 41VV2012 yielded very little feature or artifact data due to the poor
integrity of the excavated features and impacts to the ground surface from deflation/erosion and the
mechanical impacts during the clearing of the proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW. As such, little new
information from 41VV2012 beyond basic chronological and descriptive data was obtained during the
recovery excavations.
In contrast to 41VV2012, site 41VV2013 provided more hard data from which inferences and hypotheses
are possible. Although the site contained multiple thermal features, no other area exhibited the
concentration of ashy soil and clustered features documented in Locus A; it appears to represent the
primary activity area within the sample of 41VV2013 located within the project ROW. Multiple uses of
Locus A is suggested by not only the density of cultural material, but also the radiocarbon assays from
several of the clustered features that intimate multiple use of the same features during an approximately
250-year span (ca. AD 1350 to 1600). In fact, given sufficient time, Locus A may have coalesced into a
larger midden-like feature due to repeated cycles of use and clean out indicated by excavations and
radiocarbon dates.
Data obtained from three thermal features within Locus A (Features 3, 8, and 13) and the two small earth
ovens (Features 1 and 12) sheds some light on possible group size and seasonality. These features
contained macrobotanical evidence that provides some clues to the possible plant resources processed, as
well as the time of year they were utilized. Specifically, these features are thought to represent thermal
features for processing plant resources that include pecan nut, onion-like bulb fragments, prickly pear
seed, mesquite seed, desert hackberry nutlet, and sugarberry nutlet. Unlike the large earth ovens or burned
rock middens common throughout the region (and central Texas), the hearths and earth ovens are
relatively small. The size of these features strongly suggest that resource processing occurred on the order
of hours (such as overnight) rather than days (e.g., 24 to 48 hours) that is posited for the larger earth

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

167

ovens/burned rock middens. By extension, this suggests that group size was relatively small, perhaps on
the order of three to six individuals, and occupation was short term. The short term use of the site is also
supported by a lack of feature variety and the relatively sparse artifact assemblage for a location that was
apparently used multiple times during a 262-year period. The sole faunal remains, uncovered during data
recovery, are those of a modern rodent; meat processing was not a focus of site activity. Based primarily
on macrobotanical evidence, the occupation of 41VV2013 occurred during the fall, spring, and summer
seasons.
In conclusion, data recovery at 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 provided much needed feature and radiocarbon
data from an upland context in the San Felipe Creek basin near Del Rio, Texas. Feature-focused
excavations yielded macrobotanical remains and charcoal/charred material for 19 radiocarbon assays
from features. The data recovery provided important feature morphology and construction data for short
term plant processing features. Due to erosion and extensive mechanical impacts however, the utility of
much of the data is limited.
RECOMMENDATIONS
In the opinion of B&A, data recovery investigations in parts of 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 within the
proposed Del Rio Outer Loop ROW, due to the depositional context, erosion, and mechanical impacts,
did not yield sufficient data to be recommended eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or worthy of SAL
listing. In contrast, as data recovery investigations were limited to the existing ROW, the parts of
41VV2012 and 41VV2013 that extend beyond the ROW could not be investigated; it is currently
unknown if those parts of the sites retain deposits eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or worthy of SAL
listing. As such, B&A recommends that there are no NRHP or SAL eligible deposits at 41VV2012 and
41VV2013 within the Del Rio Outer Loop ROW. Further, if additional ROW is needed for any future
expansions of the Del Rio Outer Loop near 41VV2012 and 41VV2103, B&A recommends that additional
investigations would be necessary to assess the integrity of the sites in those areas prior to any surface and
subsurface disturbances.

GEOMORPHOLOGY-STRATIGRAPHY
The geomorphology and late Quaternary geology of the Del Rio Outer Loop project are characterized by
thin deposits of alluvium and colluvium overlying the weathered Del Rio Clay. A notable feature of the
surface geology is a grayish brown A horizon paleosol that mantles topographic low areas and is buried
by late Holocene alluvium in some small streams. The site 41VV2013 is directly associated with the
paleosol, occurring on the paleosol surface with cultural features intruded into the paleosol. The paleosol
serves as a local marker horizon for the surface geology and deposits. All of the geomorphic-stratigraphic
units are dominated by silt and clay, reflecting the fine-textured Cretaceous bedrock, especially the Del
Rio Clay and overlying Buda Limestone (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Geologic Map of the Del Rio area showing approximate location of sites 41VV2012 and
41VV2013; from Bureau of Economic Geology, 1992, Geologic Map of Texas.
The geomorphic-stratigraphic units observed during the investigation are discussed below, youngest to
oldest.

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Appendix A-1

Cover Silt
The landscape is mantled by a light brown silt, 5 to 10 cm thick. It is eolian, originating from atmospheric
dust and, although undated, may have accumulated during the past two hundred years. It is not preserved
everywhere. It is the first material to be removed by erosion when the surface is disturbed. It was
observed in only a few places in the study area.
Post-Paleosol Alluvium
The small drainage at the base of the hillslope at 41VV2013 includes a thin deposit of alluvium that
overlies the eroded surface of the A horizon paleosol (discussed below) (Figs. 2,3). The post-paleosol
alluvium is light yellowish brown clayey silt and includes a lens of gravel in the axis of the small paleochannel. About 20 cm of the top of the paleosol has been removed by erosion in the channel axis. The
alluvium is undated but likely was deposited between about 600 and 400 years ago, perhaps at the same
time that nearby site 41VV2013 was occupied. The alluvium has a weak A horizon soil in the upper 15
cm at the surface of the deposit.

Figure 3. Sketch of relationship of post-paleosol alluvium to paleosol in small channel near BHT-1; see
photo in Figure 2, 41VV2013.
A Horizon Paleosol
The most prominent feature of the local surface geology is the A horizon paleosol. It is a dark grayish
brown to grayish brown (10YR 4-4/2) clayey silt, grading in color to brown (10YR 4/3) at the base in
BHT-1. It is 80 cm thick in the axis of small drainages but becomes thinner and disappears at higher
topographic levels on hillsides (Figs. 4-10). The paleosol is massive, lacking internal bedding. The
paleosol contains many insect-burrow fills, especially the upper 20 cm. The paleosol does not have visible
carbonate although the carbonate content is very high, ranging from 30 to 54 % (Table 1). The organic
carbon content of the paleosol is also very high, ranging from 1.4 to 0.4 %. The high amounts of silt and
clay in the paleosol, the total ranging from 93 to 76 %, reflects the silt-clay dominated local Cretaceous
bedrock. A source of sand in the study area that could be incorporated into surface deposits is absent.
The paleosol is largely devoid of gravel, although occasional small limestone pebbles are present (Table
2). Also, sand-sized pellets of calcium carbonate are present, perhaps derived from the local bedrock. The
paleosol overlies alluvial gravel along stream channels and colluvium on low hillsides. It is absent from
hillcrests. Overall, the paleosol is draped over the landscape in areas of low topography within the
drainage basin of San Felipe Creek.
Paleosol age. The age of the A horizon paleosol has been determined by seven AMS radiocarbon dates on
bulk sediment from the paleosol at three backhoe trenches, including two trenches at 41VV2013 and one
trench at 41VV2012 (Table 3, Appendix). The ages range from 3140 ± 40 to 800 ± 40 14C years BP. The
period of formation of the paleosol is generalized in this report at 3200 to 800 year BP.
Sedimentation rate. A linear regression of paleosol depth versus all seven AMS dates has an r2
correlation of 0.814% (Fig. 11). The sedimentation rate from the seven AMS dates is 0.215 mm/year (or
46.5 years per cm). The sedimentation rate is rather low compared with other A horizon paleosols in the
region.
Pre-Paleosol Gravel
The paleosol rests on gravel along the narrow stream channels and is exposed in backhoe trenches 1, 2,
and 10. The gravel is alluvial in origin and is yellowish brown to light yellowish brown (10YR 5-6/4) in
Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Appendix A-3

color and a mix of gravel-sand-silt-clay. The gravel component was measured by the Milwaukee Soil
Laboratory and is 46 to 66% at the larger exposure at BHT-1 (Table 2). The clasts are mostly limestone
and include many fossil shells of oysters, probably from the nearby Buda Limestone that overlies the Del
Rio Clay. Rare clasts are composed of siltstone. The gravel exhibits weak bedding and poor sorting. The
base of the gravel was not exposed although it probably rests locally on the Del Rio Clay; at BHT-1, the
gravel is 65 cm thick. Although the gravel is undated, I estimate its age as middle Holocene.
Colluvium
Most trenches on hillslopes exposed colluvium overlying weathered Del Rio Clay. On steeper slopes,
such as at 41VV2012, colluvium is exposed at the surface. The colluvium is generally composed of
pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of limestone and siltstone, all derived from the nearby Buda Limestone, in
a matrix of clay, derived from the Del Rio Clay. The age of the colluvium is unknown.
Unit VI, Del Rio Clay (Upper Cretaceous)
The Del Rio Clay exposures in BHT-2, BHT-8, and BHT-9 are very pale brown (10YR 7/4) clayey silt
with no more than 10% sand (Table 1). The clayey silt is hard and hackly with manganese coats on
fracture surfaces, especially in the upper 60 cm of the exposures. The clay formation includes small
patches of greenish-gray clay, either inclusions or weathering products. The clay incorporates a poorly
preserved paleosol Bk horizon in the upper 25 to 60 cm with soft to hard carbonate nodules up to 30 mm
in diameter. The carbonate morphology is stage II and represents an episode of pedogenesis at some time
during the late Pleistocene prior to the development of colluvium (Unit V) and overlying alluvial gravel
(Unit IV).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
41VV2012
This site occurs on a hillside overlooking a small drainage. The hillslope is littered with limestone,
sandstone, and siltstone pebbles and blocks forming a lag gravel at the surface (Fig. 12). The pebbles are
from the denudation of the underlying colluvium and are derived originally from the Buda Limestone that
crops out at the top of the hillslope.
Colluvium, creep, and vertical slabs
The colluvium exposed at BHT-9 is 60 to 70 cm thick and is composed of limestone pebbles, cobbles,
and small boulders up to 410 mm in diameter. Most of the gravel is pebble size, and a few clasts are
sandstone and siltstone. The clasts are generally subangular and have thin carbonate coats up to 4 mm
thick. A few clasts exhibit weathering rinds. The colluvium forms a sharp basal contact with the
underlying Del Rio Clay. The clay forms a plastic medium over which the limestone-siltstone gravel
moves by the process of creep. The gravel-clay mixture flows slowly down slope by gravity, aided by the
presence of internal moisture. The colluvium shows no evidence of sorting.
An interesting aspect of the creep process is that flat-elongated (“platy” or “bladed”) slabs of siltstone
within the colluvial mass become vertically oriented during down-slope movement (Figs. 12-14). The
slabs exposed in colluvium in BHT-9 are oriented about 45° from horizontal in the downslope direction.
Upon erosion of the overlying material, the vertical slabs are exposed and superficially resemble parts of
slab-lined archaeological features.
Alluvium in small drainage at 41VV2012
A small ephemeral stream occurs at the foot of the hillslope and 41VV2012. The ephemeral channel is
about 2 m wide and 0.5 m deep. Gravel is exposed in the cut bank. BHT-8 is located on a low alluvial
bench about 9 meters from the small channel and exposes 35 cm of gravel directly overlying weathered
Del Rio Clay (Fig. 15). The gravel contains many fossil oyster shells, probably derived from the Buda
Limestone that forms low escarpments on nearby hilltops (Fig. 16). The top of the gravel deposit has been
recently disturbed by road building activity. The age of the gravel is not determined but is estimated to be
middle Holocene.
Closer to the present-day channel, BHT-10 exposes the A horizon paleosol overlying alluvial gravel
(Figs. 17,18). The paleosol at this locality is 45 cm thick and is a brown (10YR 4/3) clayey silt. It is
massive without bedding and has some insect burrow fills. It does not have visible carbonate although
laboratory analysis shows 45% calcium carbonate (Table 1). The paleosol is AMS dated 800 ± 40 and
1740 ± 40 14C years BP at this locality, demonstrating that it is the same A horizon paleosol that is present
at 41VV2013.

41VV2013
Site 41VV2013 also occurs on a hillslope although it is less steep than at 41VV2012. Because of lower
relief, the A horizon paleosol occurs at the site as well as up and down the adjacent hillslope (Fig. 4). The
site occurs with features intruded into the A horizon paleosol. Features throughout the site generally rest
on the paleosol. BHT-5 is nearest to the core of the site (Figs. 19,20).
Given the age of the paleosol as 3200 to 800 years BP and the age of features from 41VV2013 with a
tight chronology extending from 480 ± 30 to 290 ± 30 14C years BP, it is clear that the site was occupied
on the stable surface of the paleosol after it was no longer forming. However, the AMS age of one feature
is 1780 ± 30 years BP, indicating that that feature may have been used much earlier during the period of
paleosol development.
Site Disturbance
Natural processes can disturb the stratigraphy and spatial location of artifacts in archaeological sites. Two
potential sources of disturbance were observed at 41VV2013.
Burrowing activity. Carnivores can dig furiously to catch a mouse in its underground den, resulting in
large, deep burrows such as exposed in BHT-6 (Fig. 21). Upon filling, the burrows can resemble cultural
features. Large areas of fill can also incorporate displaced artifacts. Coarse-scale burrowing is an active
process in the area today (Fig. 22).
Shrink-swell process. Deposits with a high clay content, such as the A horizon paleosol at 41VV2013,
can be affected by shrink-swell processes. Clay minerals absorb water and expand in volume. Upon
drying and loss of water, clays shrink in volume. The shrinking process results in the formation of cracks,
such as observed in this study (Fig. 23). The cracks or fractures in clayey deposits occur repeatedly along
the same plane, although it should be noted that slickenside features were not observed in the paleosol in
trench exposures. These cracks have a potential for small artifacts to fall into them. Upon wetting, the
clay swells and the cracks close. Fallen artifacts are sealed into the clay, seemingly occurring at a greater
depth than they should be found. It is a challenge to archaeologists and cooperating geologists to identify
and not be misled by these circumstances.

DISCUSSION: CORRELATION OF A HORIZON PALEOSOL
The cumulic A horizon soil formed between about 3200 and 800 years BP in the drainage basin of San
Felipe Creek in the Del Rio area (this study). The geomorphology, sedimentology, and chronology of the
paleosol are identical to the late Holocene soil that formed throughout the southern Great Plains and
called the Copan paleosol (Hall, 1977). Radiocarbon dates on charcoal associated with the Copan paleosol
indicate that it formed between 2000 and 1000 years BP. Diverse lines of evidence also indicate that the
climate during the period of soil formation was moister than today (Hall, 1990).
Two other studies in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas also indicate that the paleosol documented in the Del
Rio area is a predominant feature of the regional late Holocene geology. At El Paso, a thick cumulic
paleosol formed on the Rio Grande floodplain between 2500 and 1000 years BP (Hall, 1992). Its
environment of deposition is identical to that of the Copan paleosol observed throughout the southern
Great Plains. More recently, a study of alluvium from a low terrace of the Rio Grande north of Laredo
revealed a buried A horizon paleosol, producing a single radiocarbon date of 1670 ± 70 14C years BP
(Hall, 2010) that falls within the period of widespread soil development.
All of these thick, cumulic A horizon paleosols correlate to the same time period, and all of them formed
in the broad region in the south-central United States at a time characterized by wetter conditions than
present today. Stable carbon isotope data, discussed below, suggests that the cumulic soils form in wet
meadow habitats along floodplains of small and large streams alike.
It should be noted that the A horizon paleosol in the Del Rio study area is not restricted to the narrow
floodplains of the small drainages. Instead, the paleosol also formed on lower hillslopes adjacent the
drainages. The occurrence of the paleosol on low hillslopes suggests that surface water was abundant,

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Appendix A-15

promoting the growth of C4 tall-grasses on floodplains and hillslopes alike. In all other documented
records, the Copan paleosol and its equivalents are restricted to floodplains.
As noted earlier in this report, another aspect of the Del Rio-area A horizon paleosol that diverges from
the Copan paleosol is that it evidently began to form about 700 years earlier and continued to form 200
years later than elsewhere in the southern Great Plains. The two younger AMS dates, 840 ± 40 and 800 ±
40 14C years BP, are from the upper 10 to 25 cm of the paleosol that has been strongly bioturbated by
insects. The young age of the upper part of the paleosol may be a consequence of bioturbation.
DISCUSSION: PALEOECOLOGY
Stable Carbon Isotopes
Different groups of plants fractionate carbon isotopes in different ways, resulting in natural variability in
the radiocarbon signal from different plant groups. So that radiocarbon ages are not biased by carbon
isotope fractionation, the measured radiocarbon dates are normalized to a δ13C value of -25.00‰, the
approximate value of most woody plants. In this study, the AMS radiocarbon ages from the A horizon
paleosol are on bulk sediment. Accordingly, the δ13C values of the samples represent an amalgam of
organic carbon from the plants in the local vegetation, both C3 and C4 species, at the time that the organic
matter was deposited.
The δ13C values of seven AMS radiocarbon ages range from -18.4 to -15.4‰ with a mean value of -16.2
± 1.02‰. According to recent studies of δ13C composition of various soils in the Great Plains, values
greater (less negative) than -19.00‰ represent C4-dominated plant communities that in turn are composed
largely of warm climate grass species found in the present-day shortgrass and mixed grass prairies (Nordt
et al., 2008).
However, a new interpretation that differs from the above scenario has been suggested. It has been
pointed out that the Copan paleosol in the southern Great Plains is characterized by high (less negative)
δ13C values (Hall et al., 2011), such as documented also at Del Rio (this study). While a literal
interpretation of the carbon isotope criteria is that the Copan paleosol formed under warm-dry conditions,
other evidence from geomorphology, sedimentology, pollen analysis, unionid clam faunas, land snail
faunas, and vertebrate faunas all indicate that the paleosol formed under cool-wet conditions. It has also
been noted that the high δ13C signature may be a consequence of wet meadow vegetation that, in the
Great Plains, is dominated by tallgrass prairie grasses, all of which are C4. As suggested by Hall et al.
(2011), the Copan paleosol and its equivalents represent wet meadow habitats with grass species from the
tallgrass prairies.
Given the same circumstances at Del Rio, I interpret the A horizon paleosol in this study as representing a
wetter environment with tall grasses during the period ca. 3200 to 800 years BP.
It should be pointed out that the numerous AMS radiocarbon ages from features at the two archaeological
sites are on charred wood. The δ13C values range from -26.5 to -23.6‰, representing C3 woody species.
The woody plants were components of the local vegetation. Prior to the occupation of the sites, however,
the lowland vegetation was dominated by a C4 prairie grassland community.

Molluscan Fauna
The A horizon paleosol has a molluscan fauna consisting of at least four species of land snails. The shells
are scattered throughout the paleosol and are not concentrated in lenses or zones. The four species of land
snails from the paleosol are typical of the fauna found in the region at present (Figs. 24, 25). However, the
abundance of the shells in the paleosol may indicate that the habitat in which the snails lived was
somewhat moister than today in the region. Even though these species are found in Val Verde County
today, they seldom occur in open, dry places but are instead found in protected, less-exposed habitats
such as under rocks and surface duff (Cheatum and Fullington, 1971; Fullington and Pratt, 1974).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A summary diagram of the surface geology and AMS chronology of the two archaeological sites on the
Outer Loop is shown in Figure 26.
1. The geomorphology of the two archaeological sites is fairly straight forward. The surface geology is
dominated by an A horizon paleosol, alluvial gravel, and colluvium.
2. The A horizon paleosol is AMS dated between 3200 and 800 years BP. AMS dated features from site
41VV2013 are younger than the paleosol, indicating that the site was occupied on the surface of the
paleosol. Features may intrude into it.
3. The A horizon paleosol correlates with a region paleosol that formed in stream valleys at the same
time. The regional paleosol formed during a period of moister climate in a wet meadow environment.
4. Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 are younger than the paleosol, indicating that the sites may have been
occupied during a period of dry climate, similar to the present-day conditions.
5. The A horizon paleosol overlies gravel along the narrow stream channels. Cultural materials were not
observed in the gravel. Although undated, the alluvial gravel is likely middle Holocene.

6. The colluvial deposits at 41VV2012 contain slabs of thin bedded siltstone that, due to the mass
movement process of creep, become oriented at a 45° dip downslope. Upon exposure during denudation
of the overlying colluvium, the vertical slabs may be mistaken for slab-lined cultural features.
7. Burrow fills in and below the A horizon paleosol can originate by natural digging by carnivores
searching prey. These burrow fills may be mistaken for cultural features.
8. Shrink-swell of the clay-rich A horizon paleosol, such as at 41VV2013, may result in the dislocation of
small artifacts to greater depth in the soil column.
9. The A horizon paleosol contains a land snail fauna of four species; they all inhabit the area today but
were perhaps more abundant during the wetter period of soil formation.
10. The high (less negative) δ13C values of the AMS radiocarbon dates on bulk sediment indicate that the
paleosol formed in a vegetation dominated by C4 grasses. Based on other studies, the C4 grasses may have
been tallgrass prairie species, representing wet meadow environments.
11. The A horizon paleosol evidently began forming about 700 years before the regional Copan paleosol
and may have continued to form about 200 years later than the Copan.
12. The A horizon paleosol in the Del Rio area formed on both floodplains and hillslopes, indicating that
surface water was abundant about 3200 to 800 years BP. Elsewhere in the southern Great Plains, the
Copan paleosol formed only on floodplains.

Plant Remains from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013:
The Del Rio Loop Project
Phil Dering
The purpose of this analysis of 19 flotation samples and 15 macrobotanical samples is to provide an
assessment of the botanical assemblages from two archeological sites, 41VV2012 and 41VV2013, located
within the Del Rio Loop Project right-of-way. The data will be utilized to assess the nature and condition
of the plant remains from these sites and provide some evidence for plant utilization and local
environmental conditions.
Methods
There are two types of samples in the current study – flotation samples and macrobotanical samples.
Flotation is a method of recovering organic remains from archeological sediments by using water to
separate heavy and soluble inorganic particles from plant parts and small animal bone. The material
floating to the surface is called the light fraction, and this is caught on a fine mesh screen or strainer. The
material that sinks to the bottom is the heavy fraction and it is also caught on a fine mesh screen. Most of
the soil including clay and silt is suspended in water, passes through the screens, and is discarded. The
light and heavy fractions from each sample are combined for analysis. Nineteen samples of archeological
sediments totaling 81.5 liters were submitted for processing and analysis.
Macrobotanical samples are carbonized plant remains that are separated from the rest of the archeological
material by hand. They are collected either from an excavator’s screen or are point-collected and plotted
individually in the field. They are often labeled 14C or radiocarbon samples.
The analysis follows standard archeobotanical laboratory procedures. The volume of the light fraction is
first measured. In most cases up to 100 ml of light fraction from each sample is set aside for analysis.
Then the portion to be analyzed is passed through a nested set of screens of 4mm, 2mm, 1mm, and
0.450mm mesh and examined for charred material, which is separated for identification. The heavy
fraction is also scanned for charcoal, which is set aside for identification. The results are combined with
identifications from each corresponding light fraction. In the current study, charred plant material was so
scarce that I sorted through the entire volume of each light fraction that was submitted for analysis.
Plant material is sorted into two categories –woody fragments, and seed/fruit fragments including maize
or agave parts when present. Identification of carbonized wood is accomplished by using the snap
technique, examining the fragments at 8 to 45 magnifications with a hand lens or a binocular dissecting
microscope, and comparing the material to samples in the archeobotanical herbarium. All seed
identifications are made using seed manuals and reference collections at Shumla Archeobotanical
Services. Only charred plant material is included in the analysis, because uncarbonized material is
consumed by insects, fungi and bacteria and does not survive more than a few years in the deposits of
open sites.

Appendix D-1

Up to 25 wood charcoal fragments large enough to be manipulated are examined and identified from each
flotation sample. Fragments smaller than 2- or 3- mm cannot be manipulated and are usually placed in the
indeterminate category. When a sample contains more than 25 fragments, the rest of the material is
scanned to make sure that no other taxa are present. Then the volume of the charcoal is measured and
included along with its weight in the report. The results for each sample are presented in tabular format.
Disturbance Indicators. Sample content may be affected by various biological disturbance factors,
including insect or small mammal activity, and plant root growth. In an effort to assess this impact, the
amounts of insect parts, gastropods, and modern uncharred seeds are estimated for each flotation sample.
These estimates are reported on a scale of 1-4 (+), 6-25 (++), 26-50 (+++), and over 50 (++++).
Results and Discussion
Results of the analysis are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 lists the sample proveniences along
with seed taxa counts and seed and/or bulb fragment counts from each sample. Identifications and counts
from flotation samples appear in Table 2 and the results of macrobotanical samples in Table 3.

Table 1 indicates that recovery of charred plant material in the flotation samples was poor at 41VV2012,
and moderate for an open site in most of the samples from 41VV2013. The total charcoal in each flotation
sample varies from none in a single sample (Lot 169, 41VV 2013) to 3.9 g in Lot 50, 41VV2013.
Disturbance indicators are abundant. Roots, gastropods, and insect parts constitute the majority of the
disturbance indicators, and some samples contain uncharred seeds.
Tables 2 and 3 indicate that either seeds or bulb fragments were recovered from six of the 19 samples.
Mesquite seed fragments are present in one sample; prickly pear seed and bulb fragments are present in
two samples each. Pecan nut fragment and hackberry nutlet were recovered from a single sample each.
Carbonized wood fragments are present in all but one sample, and include 12 taxa or wood types:
mesquite/ acacia, mesquite, cottonwood/ willow, oak, pecan, condalia/ javelina bush, ocotillo, granjeño
(desert hackberry), sycamore, elbowbush, guayacan, and Texas persimmon. The following description
will address plant remains found in samples recovered from each site.

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Oak wood charcoal indicates the influence of the nearby San Felipe Creek embayment because oak is
confined to canyons along the southwestern edge of the Edwards Plateau. No remains of plant food
resources were noted in the samples.
The presence of oak and mesquite is not surprising for two reasons. Both mesquite and oak wood provide
excellent fuel wood, and both have easily recognizable anatomical patterns that can be detected in very
small fragments. The lack of plant food resources is a common occurrence in small, shallowly buried or
surface features, along the Rio Grande Plains and the southwestern Edwards Plateau. Turning plant food
remains into charcoal was not the cook’s primary goal. These smaller features were likely used very few
times which further reduces the chance of accidental carbonization of plant foods.
41VV2013. Fifteen samples from eight features were analyzed. Considering the fact that these features
were either shallowly buried or exposed (deflated) surface features, they yielded a surprising quantity and
variety of charred material. These samples were far more productive than the material from 41VV2012.
Wood charcoal fragments from the site are assigned to 11 different taxa. These taxa include pecan,
sycamore, oak, and cottonwood/willow types, trees that grow on the lower terraces of San Felipe Creek.
Seven wood types, including granjeño (desert hackberry), condalia/ javelina bush, Texas persimmon,
mesquite/ acacia, elbowbush, guayacan, and ocotillo are upland xeric shrubs or small trees.
Small quantities of edible plant parts are present in six of the fifteen samples analyzed from this site.
These include pecan nut (pericarp) fragments, bulb fragments, prickly pear seed, mesquite seed, granjeño
(desert hackberry) and sugarberry nutlet fragments. The material suggests some of the food processing
activities that occurred around these features.
Feature 1. This feature is represented by two flotation samples totaling 12.0 liters. The most abundant
material recovered from the samples is mesquite/acacia wood charcoal. Other wood types include
granjeño, oak, and sycamore. Three macrobotanical samples from this feature are identified as
mesquite/acacia. Two prickly pear seeds are also present in one of the samples. Prickly pear is one of the
more common seeds recovered from sites in the region, but it also was one of the most important and
reliable fruit crops.
Feature 3. Two flotation samples totaling 18.0 liters were analyzed from this feature. Mesquite/acacia
wood is abundant, accompanied by upland xeric species including elbowbush, and condalia/javelina bushtype. Pecan wood from trees that must have grown in the San Felipe Creek valley is also present. A single
macrobotanical sample is identified as mesquite. Edible plant remains include sugarberry/hackberry and
granjeño nutlets, as well as mesquite and prickly pear seeds.
The sugarberry/hackberry and granjeño nutlets may be intrusive because they are composed of calcium
carbonate and need not be charred to survive several centuries in the soil. They also tend to roll into
cracks and animal burrows, working their way down the solum. There is however, desert hackberry wood
in the assemblage and sugarberry is a common tree in the San Felipe Springs area, so both would have
been available for utilization. The presence of a mesquite seed provides evidence for the consumption of
mesquite beans.

Feature 5. Plant remains in the two flotation samples from this feature are represented only by wood
charcoal. Wood types include Texas persimmon, ocotillo, and hackberry. The most abundant charred
wood type in the flotation samples is mesquite/ acacia. The single macrobotanical sample from this site is
also mesquite/ acacia.
Feature 8. Mesquite/ acacia is the most abundant identifiable charred plant material present in the two
flotation samples from this feature. A smaller quantity of guayacan wood, and indeterminate wood
charcoal that did not have diagnostic anatomical features due to distortion by high temperatures was also
identified. Four macrobotanical samples also were identified as mesquite/ acacia wood. Edible plant
remains include prickly pear and pecan nut fragments (pericarps), a clear indication of the proximity of
the site to San Felipe Creek.
Feature 12. The samples recovered from this feature yielded mesquite/acacia, cottonwood/willow-type
wood, and oak as well as indeterminate wood type. Edible plant remains are bulb fragments which I have
assigned to the onion-type category. It is difficult to identify vegetative storage parts of plants, but these
bulb fragments are the approximate size of wild onions.
Feature 13. Two flotation samples contain sycamore, oak, mesquite/acacia, Texas persimmon, and
granjeño wood charcoal. As in Feature 12, bulb fragments were noted along with the wood charcoal.
These fragments consisted of concentric layers or scales of plant material typical of bulbs.
Feature 14. A single flotation sample from this feature is the only one that does not contain charred plant
material larger than the size of charcoal flecks (<1.0 mm), too small to identify.
Feature 15. The flotation samples recovered from this feature contain an abundance of mesquite/acacia
wood charcoal along with cottonwood/willow, Texas persimmon, condalia/javelina bush, and pecan
wood. Three macrobotanical samples from the feature contain mesquite/acacia, condalia/javelina bushtype, and indeterminate fragments. Edible plant parts were not recovered from this feature.
Discussion
The samples from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 present an interesting snapshot of plant gathering along the
edge of a comparatively mesic creek valley located in a semi-arid grassland. Descriptions of the area
north and east of San Felipe Creek suggest a short grass prairie with few shrubs, mostly mesquite. In 1849
Henry Chase Whiting encountered “. . . an extensive and rolling prairie dotted here and there with little
thickets of mesquite, of less elevation than the great table formation of the upper prairies . . .” (Whiting
1938:343). Rocky ridges would have had less grass and more woody vegetation, but one would have
viewed a grassland which was much more open only 150 years ago than it is today.
The variety of fuel wood types recovered from the fire-cracked rock features speaks to the mosaic of
vegetation that must have existed on this upland overlooking nearby San Felipe Creek. The abundance of
mesquite/acacia is accompanied by a variety of smaller shrubs; the locals used what fuel stocks were
nearby, and that included the desirable mesquite or acacia as well as the less than desirable condalia/
javelina bush, ocotillo, and others. The fact that some creek valley species, including willow/ cottonwood,

Appendix D-8

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

pecan, and oak were present suggests that firewood was not overly abundant on the uplands, because the
fuel would have been brought up from the valley.
Edible plant remains include bulbs (onion-type), mesquite pods (represented by seed), prickly pear fruit
(represented by seed remains), and pecan nut. This combination of resources indicates an area that is
relatively rich, resulting from the edge effect created by the creek as it winds through an area bordered on
the east by the south Texas Plains and on the west by drier, rocky southern edge of the western plateau
country.
The fire-cracked rock features (FCR) are the most visible and enduring remains of ephemeral camps.
They would have served as multipurpose heating facilities, but hot rocks are usually used as heating
sources for foods that require longer periods of time to cook, that is, hours rather than minutes. Large
heating features (100 cm or larger) are likely used to cook either sotol or lechuguilla, larger resources that
require more than one full day to cook. However, the areas around these features would have been the
focus of many food preparation activities that did not involve the use of a cooking facility. For example, I
have recovered little walnut pericarps from large FCR cooking facilities and middens in northern Val
Verde County (Dering 2003). These larger facilities had little to do with the preparation of little walnut.
Instead, they were utilized for cooking sotol or lechuguilla. Forager camps are subject to overprinting,
which means that activity areas are not always sharply delineated. This is especially the case in areas
where earth ovens are utilized, large amounts of rock and soil are removed, and new facilities are
constructed, resulting in repeated disturbance of the living surface. Plant remains, discarded tools, and
other archaeological remains are repeatedly cycled into and out of the oven and its earthen cap.
Additionally, pits of any kind, rock-lined or otherwise, tend to collect material from the surrounding
activity areas. The following ethnographic descriptions should assist in the interpretation of the plant
remains.
Ethnobotanical Observations
Pecan. Pecan trees grow along streams throughout the mid-section of North America from Texas to
southern Indiana. The study area is located along the western limits of pecan distribution. While traveling
through the San Pedro (Devils River) canyon in 1849, Whiting recorded two examples of pecan stands.
While traveling in the upper reaches of the Devils River canyon he recorded “. . . a still and beautiful
lagoon of clear blue water, half hidden by a dense grove of lofty pecans . . . ” Brune (1981) identifies this
as the headwaters of the Devils River. Not far downstream Whiting noted that he “. . . came suddenly on a
magnificent pecan grove which enclosed a bright blue lagoon. The landscape, which was very beautiful,
is similar to that at the head of the river.” (1938: 343-346). Pecan groves were scattered intermittently
along the Devils River canyon, which is located just west of San Felipe Creek.
Pecan is identified only occasionally from archeological sites in Texas, perhaps because of the thin
pericarp and the fact it wasn’t often processed into oil like walnuts, a heat intensive activity that tends to
char large quantities of nuts. Thick layers of pecan nut fragments were noted in Baker Cave, a large
rockshelter located near Baker’s Crossing on the Devils River about 30 km north of Comstock, Texas.
The dry deposits of this site provide a perfect environment for the preservation of plant remains, and the

earlier layers containing pecan are over 5,000 years old (Hall 2000). The Kyle site, located in Hill
County, central Texas, contained pecans in 650 year-old archeological deposits (Jelks 1962). Pecan nut
fragments that were about 350 years old were identified at the Varga site, northeast of Del Rio in Edwards
County (Quigg et al 2005).
Pecans are rich in oil, hence calorie-rich, and are a very important food resource in an otherwise fat-poor
environment. Pecans are a high energy food source, and 100 g of pecan nut meat yields about 690 kcal
and that portion contains 72% fat, 9.2% protein, 13% carbohydrates, and only 3.5% water. The nut meat
is also packed with 19 vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, vitamin E, folic acid, calcium,
magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, several B vitamins and zinc (Hall 2000; USDA 2003).
Pecans require very little processing and produce a predictable fall harvest, a real asset to mobile foragers.
Cabeza de Vaca noted in his journal that: "They grind up some little grains with them [the nuts], two
months of the year, without eating anything else, and even this they do not have every year, because one
year they bear, and the next they do not. They [the nuts] are the size of those of Galicia and the trees are
very large and there is a great number of them." (Krieger 2002:189-190). The observation emphasizes a
downside of pecan groves; they produce on a biennial cycle, alternating each year between a low-yield
harvest and a high-yield harvest. This variation in productivity had an impact on the people who
depended on pecans for a source of fat and calories. San Felipe Creek would have produced a boom or
bust fall harvest of pecans.
Mesquite. Mesquite seeds are often recovered from archeological sites, although the pods surrounding
the seeds are the part that is ground into flour. The seeds are high in plant protein (29-39%) but are not
easy to process, are indigestible, and are discarded, becoming incorporated into archeological deposits as
a waste product of pod processing. Mesquite pods are rich in carbohydrates and have low moisture
content. These are important qualities for efficient harvesting and processing, and they provide an
excellent food resource. Hodgson (2001) reports that mesquite mesocarps (pods) contain about 32%
sugars and 7% protein.
The few historic records from Texas suggest that, throughout its distribution, mesquite was a vital
resource for food, fuel, medicine, and implement-making. Cabeza de Vaca, traveling through either
southern Texas or northern Mexico in the 1520's, is the first European to note details regarding the use of
mesquite by Native Americans. While living among the Cuchendados, he observed the use of mesquite
pods for food. A pit was filled with pods, which were pounded with a large wooden pestle the thickness
of a man’s thigh. The pod meal was then consumed raw, along with handfuls of earth that had been mixed
with the meal. The seeds were discarded along with their woody casings (Campbell and Campbell 1981;
Krieger 2002).
Cabeza de Vaca noted that gorging on mesquite pods causes swelling of the abdomen. This condition
results from consuming large quantities of indigestible fiber and long-chain sugars to the exclusion of
other types of food. A similar occurrence is recorded in Sonora by Pfefferkorn who describes a man who
gorged on mesquite beans and whose stomach was so distended that his skin was stretched like a drum

(Treutlein 1949). Most groups consumed mesquite flatcakes with other foods, probably to avoid a similar
fate (Hodgson 2001:185).
Hackberry. Hackberry fruits are rich in sugar and calcium. When pounded into a pulp, they can be easily
dried or mixed with other foods. Desert hackberry (Celtis pallida) fruit is quite nutritious, containing up
to 20% crude protein, as well as phosphorous, and calcium (Everitt and Alaniz 1981). The pulp is sweet
and the nutlet is crunchy but chewable. Unlike desert hackberry, sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and netleaf
hackberry (Celtis reticulata) produce a fruit with a very hard nutlet that must to be processed by pounding
into a pulp, most likely using a mortar and pestle. The Comanche beat sugarberry fruit into a pulp, rolled
it into balls with some fat, and roasted the resulting mix over a fire (Carlson et al. 1942). The Chiricahua
and Mescalero dried the fruit for future use (Castetter and Opler 1936).
Prickly Pear. Prickly pear seeds have been recovered from archeological sites throughout southern and
western Texas. The seeds are durable and easily recognizable even when fragmented. Although a single
fruit can contain over 50 seeds, this resource is by no means overrepresented in archeological samples.
Early historic observations and archeological data clearly indicate Native Americans relied on prickly
pear for food, medicine, and as a source of needles, containers, and water.
The fruit constituted a large part of the diet for several weeks in mid-summer, but the plant was used in
many other ways. The pads, especially the younger ones, can be eaten year round – direct evidence from
Hinds Cave coprolites (dried human feces) suggests that the pads themselves were eaten often (WilliamsDean 1978). When moist grass or herbs were not available, the pads were used as green packing material
providing steamy moisture and chemical compounds that helped bake lechuguilla and sotol (Dering
1999). The pads could also be used as containers and even canteens. During the tuna harvest, prickly pear
was the most important food in the region, and ranks with pecans and buffalo as a critical seasonal
resource.
The most famous ethnohistoric account of prickly pear use is recorded by Cabeza de Vaca, the first
European to cross Texas and write a first-hand report. In midsummer many different groups would
converge on the area in southern Texas where prickly pear was ripening, and this was their favorite time
of the year. They would squeeze the juice out of the fruit and dry the pulp and skin (Covey 1983). He also
describes how they ". . . gathered many tuna leaves and roasted them in an oven, and we gave them so
much fire that [the tuna leaves] were ready to eat (Krieger 2002).
Other accounts from Texas and northern Mexico underscore the importance of prickly pear to the
lifeways of the Native Americans living in the region. In the mid 1600s the Apache were pushing south,
pressuring other native groups, and the Spanish were attempting to quell general unrest in the region. In
1674, Fr. Juan Larios, with the help of Captain Elizondo and others, founded two settlements in the Rio
Grande Plains south of the Rio Grande. Santa Rosa de Santa Maria was located on the Sabinas River. San
Ildefonso de la Paz was 14 leagues (60 km) north of the Sabinas and about 80 km south of Del Rio,
Texas. They chose Santa Rosa on the Sabinas because it was well situated to attract large groups of
Native Americans, as it had an adequate water source, nut-bearing trees, and prickly pear fields. In June
of 1674 the Native American population at Santa Rosa grew into about 3,200 during the prickly pear

Appendix D-11

harvest, but the friars were concerned that they would disperse when the ripe tuna supply was exhausted.
Sure enough, as soon as the prickly pear harvest ended, they left (Wade 2003).
The Mariame bands of southern Texas coalesced at vast prickly pear stands in the summer months, at
which point the primary activity was harvesting and consuming prickly pear fruit. There is no mention of
other subsistence activities during this period, and Cabeza de Vaca says that they lived solely on prickly
pear three months a year (Covey 1983:71). Although his statement may be exaggerated, there is no
question about the most important staple during that season. Under these conditions it is likely that the
primary subsistence efforts of both men and women were focused on harvesting, processing, and
consuming prickly pear fruit (Wade 1999).
Bulbs (onion-type). One of the most likely uses of the smaller rock heating elements would have been
for baking bulbs, probably wild onion bulbs, in relatively large quantities. Although it is not necessary to
bake the bulbs to consume them, it would be necessary to bake them if they were consumed in large
quantities as a primary carbohydrate source. Like prickly pear and pecan, they are a predictable crop,
growing and flowering in the spring, if there is adequate rainfall. Unlike some bulbs that bloom after a
heavy rain at any time during the growing year, wild onion bulbs are seasonal, growing and flowering
only in spring.
Onion bulb fragments are abundant in the well-preserved rockshelter or cave deposits of the Lower Pecos
just a few kilometers west of San Felipe Creek. In Hinds Cave, the only rockshelter site for which we
have quantitative data, onion remains were the third most commonly occurring edible plant part in an
Early Archaic context, and the fifth most commonly occurring in the Late Archaic context (Dering
1999:663). These data suggest that bulbs were consumed in large quantities, not as a condiment but as a
staple. The coprolite data also confirm the importance of wild onion, where in one study it was noted in
40% of the coprolites (Williams-Dean 1978), and in another study over 55% of the coprolites (Stock
1983). Within the past year fragments of charred bulbs, probably onions, were identified from an
archeological site in nearby Uvalde County. Bulbs, either onion or eastern camas, have been recovered
from numerous earth oven or pit-hearth contexts on the Edwards Plateau north and northeast of the Del
Rio area (Dering 2008).
Proximal analysis of fresh Drummond onion bulbs note that they contain 70% water, 1.7% reducing
sugar, and 18.1% non-reducing sugar (Yanovsky and Kingsbury 1938). The non-reducing sugar
represents long-chain carbohydrates, primarily inulin, which humans cannot digest. Inulin has to be
exposed to heat for long time periods to be converted to digestible sugars, and baking in an underground
pit is the most widespread technique that Native Americans utilized for this purpose (Wandsnider 1997).
Summary and Conclusions
Nineteen archeological sediment samples totaling 81.5 liters were analyzed along with 15 macrobotanical
samples. The samples, recovered from 41VV2012 and 41VV2013, contained the carbonized remains of
12 wood types and six edible plant taxa. Wood types include taxa found on stream terraces such as oak,
pecan, cottonwood/ willow, and sycamore. The taxa that would have been growing in upland rocky slopes

and ridges include mesquite/ acacia, mesquite, condalia/ javelina bush, ocotillo, granjeño, sycamore,
elbowbush, guayacan, and Texas persimmon.
Many edible plant resources in the region flower and fruit after a rain, and may be available either early or
late in the growing season. These include mesquite and many fruits such as condalia, javelina bush and
others. Mesquite can generate two crops in a single growing season if rainfall distribution permits. Other
resources, such as agave and sotol, provide a standing crop that is essentially available year-round except
during periods of extreme drought stress. However, the archeobotanical assemblage from 41VV2013
contains edible food resources that are distinctly seasonal and reveal much about the economy and food
gathering activities conducted at the site. Onions would have been gathered and processed in the spring,
prickly pear in midsummer, and pecan in the fall, at least every other year. What the data do not tell us is
what was happening at the site in other seasons.
The small accumulations of both FCR and chipped stone suggest that these camps were occupied only
occasionally and for a short duration. Both the wood charcoal and the pecan and onion bulb remains
inform us that the occupants were dividing their focus between the uplands and the stream terraces when
these sites were occupied.
The bulb remains speak to the use of the smaller pit-hearths, which are largely deflated but still retained
some of the associated charcoal. The hearths of course would have been used for many purposes, but
baking bulbs would have been essential in order to consume these geophytes as a major source of
calories. It is not possible to access the long-chain carbohydrates in an onion unless they are first broken
into smaller segments, usually by the process of hydrolysis. The find helps to explain at least one function
of the numerous smaller hearth features that occur along stream sides and adjacent ridges throughout
south and southwest Texas.

Pollen Extraction
There are a number of articles, chapters, and even books on methods that one can use to successfully
extract fossil pollen from various types of sediments (Hunt, 1985; Riding and Kyffin-Hughes, 2004),
including some articles that focus specifically on techniques used for archaeological sediments (Bryant,
1988; Bryant and Holloway, 1983; Coil et al., 2003).
Pollen extraction is a critical part of any project because the use of certain acids and methods can lead to
the loss of fossil pollen, while other methods may not remove enough of the detritus to permit accurate
identification of the fossil pollen in the remaining residue. For these reasons, it is essential that reports,
such as this, include the precise methods used during the extraction procedure so that the reader can be
assured that pollen recovery was maximized and that fossil pollen was not inadvertently destroyed or lost
during processing.
Facilities: All work for this project was conducted using sterile, surgical gloves in the sealed TAMU
Palynology Laboratory under a fume hood. In addition, glycerin-coated slides are left exposed in various
locations within the lab and they are checked weekly for any signs of outside pollen contamination. None

were noted during processing or after this project was completed. Thus, I am certain that none of the
pollen I found came from contamination in our facility.
Pollen Extraction Procedures:
The extraction procedure I used for these samples consisted of the following steps.
1. From each sample, I removed 20 grams of soil, or less if the sample contained less than 20 grams as
indicated in Table 1, and placed it into a 600 ml plastic beaker. Next, I added 50 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid (HCl), to dissolve calcium carbonates in the soil, and two Lycopodium tablets each of
which contained 18,583 tracer spores. I used two tablets because the vast majority of pollen samples I
have examined from the arid regions of Texas and the American Southeast suggest that pollen counts
rarely exceed 54,000 pollen grains per gram of soil. Thus the ratio of tracer spores to fossil pollen in each
gram of soil is rarely greater than a ratio of 1:2.
The use of tracer spores in pollen samples has been extensively studied by Louis Maher (1981) and
others. He noted that the number of tracer spores added to samples should be in a ratio of between 1:1 and
1:2 (tracer spores vs. fossil pollen) to achieve statistically accurate calculations of fossil pollen
concentrations per gram or milliliter of sediment. I use Lycopodium spores as a tracer in most sediment
from sites in the temperate and arid regions of the United States and other temperate regions because it is
extremely rare to find naturally occurring Lycopodium plants growing in those regions. Therefore, the
only potential source of these spores in the samples I examined is most probably the tablets that were
added.
After all reaction with the HCl had stopped, I filled the beaker with distilled water and allowed the beaker
to stand for four hours. After that, the liquid portion was carefully poured off. Pollen will remain
suspended in water for various periods of time, but after four hours fossil pollen will settle to the bottom
of a container and thus the liquid portion can be poured off without loss of fossil pollen (Lentfer et al.,
2003). The remaining sediment in the beaker was spun down using 50 ml centrifuge tubes (CT) in a
centrifuge and the liquid was then poured off. This process was repeated twice.
2. I then added 15 ml of concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF) (56%) to the sediment in the CT, stirred the
sample, and let it sit overnight in the fume hood. I might caution others that this is very dangerous and
that the HF must be added very slowly at the rate of only 1-2 ml at a time. The sample must then be
thoroughly stirred and allowed to sit for one minute before adding more HF. Some sediment, especially
those containing fine-grained clays and mica, will react violently to the HF once the sediment reaches a

Appendix E-4

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

high temperature caused by the rapid dissolving of some of the fine-grained silicates. After HF is added, it
will slowly heat the sediment as it begins to react with the silicates. If one adds too much HF at first, once
it heats to a certain temperature, the HF will “explode” out of the top of the CT and hot HF will cover
everything in the fume hood. This will not only “ruin” the original sample, but can contaminate other
samples under the fume hood and will deposit the HF on all the counter surfaces, which must then be
neutralized with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Worst of all, if the processor is standing in front of the
fume hood when this occurs; he/she will also be peppered with HF, which can cause permanent injury and
even death to the individual.
The HF process removes most of the fine-grained silicates from the sample and does not damage the
pollen. The next day I filled the CT with distilled water, spun it down, rinsed it twice with distilled water,
and then filled the CT with concentrated HCl. This HCl step is necessary to ensure removal of
fluorosilicates in the sample, which often form as a result of the HF treatment. After two or three HCl
rinses, the samples were rinsed again in distilled water twice.
4. Next I transferred the material in each sample to a 15 ml CT and then added 10 ml of 5% potassium
hydroxide (KOH) and heated them for 10 minutes at 180oF. This was followed by two washes in distilled
water.
5. Next, I added 10 ml of concentrated HCl and heated each sample for one minute. I then spun down the
sample, poured out the liquid, and again rinsed the sample twice in distilled water. This HCl step is
essential to remove any remaining humic acids and dissolved compounds that might be present in each
sample after the KOH treatment, but are not removed during repeated water washings.
6. Each sample was then rinsed in glacial acetic acid, centrifuged, and then the glacial acetic acid was
carefully poured off.
7. Next, I added 10 ml of a mixture of 1 part sulfuric acid to 9 parts acetic anhydride. This is known as the
acetolysis process (Erdtman, 1960). After heating each sample in a heating block at 180oF for 10 minutes,
I centrifuged the solution and then poured off the liquid.
8. I then rinsed each sample in glacial acetic acid and after centrifuging, I poured off the glacial acetic
acid.
9. Next, the samples were rinsed twice in distilled water.

10. The next step was to fill each CT one-half full of zinc bromide (ZnBr2), which has a specific gravity
of 2.0. That solution was thoroughly mixed with a wooden stick in the sample for 60 seconds as it was
being spun on a vortex stirrer to ensure complete mixing of all solid material in the CT. I then let the
samples sit for 5 minutes. After that I spun the samples at 500 RPMs for 5 minutes. When that was
completed, I very carefully used a pipette to remove the upper part of the ZnBr2, which contained all of
the pollen and tracer spores. I then checked the material that was at the bottom of each CT to ensure that
no pollen was lost. None was lost. The ZnBr2 solution containing the pollen was placed into a 100 ml
beaker and 80 ml of 95% ethanol (ETOH) was added to reduce the specific gravity and permit the pollen
to sink during centrifuging (Jones and Bryant, 2001). All of the solution in each sample was carefully
spun down in 12 ml CT during 8 separate centrifuging processes.
11. The final step consisted of rinsing the residue in each sample twice in ETOH, adding five drops of
safranin-0 stain, then rinsing each CT once again in ETOH and centrifuging the CT. The remaining liquid
was carefully poured off and the residue at the bottom of the CT was then poured into a one dram vial.
Five drops of glycerin was added to each sample and the samples were placed on a warming plate to
enable the remaining ETOH to evaporate overnight.
Pollen Identification and Analysis
When the remaining ETOH had evaporated in each of the processed pollen samples, I carefully stirred the
residue in each vial and then added additional glycerin to the samples because the remaining residue was
still too thick to apply to microscope slides. The objective is to thin the remaining residue enough so that
when it is placed on a slide, all of the materials will remain in a single plane thereby not obscuring pollen
grains that might be either above or below other objects. I then prepared a series of individual slides for
each sample using the technique explained in the paper by Jones and Bryant (1998). Failure to prepare
slides carefully and properly can result in skewed data results during the examination and counting of
fossil pollen, as noted in experiments conducted by Brooks and Thomas (1967).
Pollen examination was performed using a NIKON OPTIPHOT binocular microscope at magnifications
ranging from 400x-1000x. Identifications of potential pollen and spore types are checked against
reference materials on file in the Texas A&M Palynology Laboratory. These modern pollen reference
materials include the Texas A&M Modern Pollen Reference Collection, the Mobil Oil Modern Pollen
Reference Collection, the Meredith Lieux LSU Modern Pollen Reference Collection, and the AMOCO
Modern Pollen Reference Collection.

Fossil Pollen: I scanned the prepared microscope slides from each of the six samples and found that
overall the fossil pollen preservation was very poor and that the presence of fossil pollen in the each of
the six samples was either nonexistent or in very degraded condition.
The very few pollen grains that could be found were in poor condition yet many of the most durable types
could still be recognized in at least three of these six samples. These pollen types are the most common
types that tend to be found in highly degraded archaeological samples and which can often be identified
because of either their unique morphology or durability in oxidizing soil environments (Bryant and Hall,
1993).
Discussion
During the last 50 years, palynologists have learned that there are many complex factors that determine
the original composition of the pollen rain in a region. These include factors such as: 1) types of
pollination; 2) differences in pollen production; 3) differential dispersion patterns; and 4) the size, weight,
and aerodynamic ability of pollen types to remain airborne. In addition, for some locations, pollen
deposition will also be influenced by the activities of animals, birds, or humans using the site area. Once
deposited, other factors influence the eventual loss or recovery of specific pollen types. These factors
include: 1) pollen recycling and/or mixture due to wind, water, human, or animal interference; 2) the
chemical composition of a pollen grain’s wall (exine); 3) the morphological shape and surface
ornamentation type of each pollen type; and 4) the susceptibility of each pollen type to various types of
degradation processes including those from mechanical, chemical, or biological agents (Bryant et al.,
1994; Bryant and Hall, 1993; Campbell and Campbell, 1994; Holloway, 1989; King et al., 1975;
O’Rourke, 1990).
I believe that one of the more important factors contributing to the fossil pollen destruction in the deposits
from the Del Rio samples was the process of repeated wetting and drying of the soils. Various forms of
pollen destruction and deterioration have already been linked to the phenomenon associated with the
evaporative process of changing a liquid into a gas. Experiments conducted by Burstyn and Bartlett
(1975) showed that significant pressure is exerted on the curved surface of an organic-walled, hollow
sphere (i.e., pollen grains) at the instant when water is transformed, by evaporation, from a liquid to a gas.
This pressure phenomenon would be especially critical for water-filled, tiny, spherical structures such as
pollen grains. As such, these forces could cause major structural damage to the thin, outer walls of pollen
grains. Each time the soil hydration-dehydration process occurs from normal conditions, such as moisture
from rain, followed by drying from wind and heat, pollen in the soil would be subjected to two potentially

Appendix E-7

destructive processes. First, the expansion-contraction process caused by being dry and then wet, and
second by the pressure phenomenon described by Burstyn and Bartlett (1975) in their study. The more
frequently this cycle occurs in a soils of any location, the greater is the potential for fossil pollen to
become distorted, crumpled, or destroyed (Campbell and Campbell 1994). The final destruction of
selective taxa of fossil pollen deposited in soils often begins with the development of stress areas and
hairline cracks in the outer wall caused during the hydration-dehydration process. As this process is
repeated, more hairline cracks occur until the grain begins breaking and then crumbles into tiny fragments
along the hairline cracks.
In later studies that tested the Burstyn and Bartlett phenomenon on specific types of pollen, first
Holloway (1989) and later Campbell and Campbell (1994) conducted controlled cycles of hydrationdehydration on soils containing pollen grains. Both authors noted that after only one hydrationdehydration cycle there were already significant changes and noticeable amounts of pollen wall (exine)
deterioration in some of the pollen types testing. In the Holloway experiment, he showed that 76% of the
fresh pollen tested and 86% of the fossilized pollen tested already contained some degree of exine
alteration and deterioration at the end of only 25 cycles of wetting and drying. Holloway’s experiments
also provided a clue about how differential pollen preservation can occur as a result of the hydrationdehydration process. Of the 14 pollen taxa he tested, those showing the greatest degree of alteration and
destruction at the end of the 25 hydration-dehydration cycles were: pecan (Carya), juniper (Juniperus),
aspen and cottonwood (Populus), Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga), willow (Salix), cattail (Typha), and maize
(Zea mays). For many of these seven pollen types the 25 hydration-dehydration cycles were so destructive
that a number of the individual pollen grains could no longer be identified with certainty because of
deterioration in the form of breakage, corrosion of surface areas, severe folding, warping, and/or
degradation of the surface ornamentation. Some of the other types included in the Holloway experiment,
such as the pollen of the low-spine composite (Iva) and the pollen of amaranths (Amaranthus), showed
only minor degradation, and those pollen types were still easily recognizable.
Hall (1981) pointed out from his studies of archaeological sites that fossil pollen assemblages in sites
containing certain types of soil conditions become progressively altered and suffer more intensely from
deterioration as the soil depth and time of exposure increases. He found that the percentage of degraded
and indeterminate pollen increases as the depth of the deposits increase in sites with unfavorable soil
conditions. Furthermore, as Hall’s study demonstrates, the presence of low diversity of pollen types, low
concentration values, and high percentages of indeterminate pollen grains indicate significant losses of
pollen by various types of deterioration. In most cases these pollen losses will be differentially distributed
among the various fossil pollen taxa that were originally deposited. As noted in a later study by Bryant
Appendix E-8

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

and Hall (1993), with increased amounts of destruction of fossil pollen in soils, the original, highly
diverse pollen record becomes reduced down to only a few remaining pollen types. These last, remaining
pollen types are generally represented by genera that produce pollen grains that are highly resistant to
various agents of destruction, or are pollen types that have unique morphological features that enable
them to be recognized even though they become severely degraded. As they note (Bryant and Hall, 1993),
these last remaining identifiable pollen types most frequently include: 1) pine pollen, 2) grass pollen, 3)
pollen produced by various species of composites [including Artemisia], 4) Ephedra, and 5) pollen grains
in the group called Cheno-Ams. As noted earlier, what minor amounts of fossil pollen that could be
identified in three of these six soil samples come mostly from these main pollen types.
We also know from previous research (Goldstein 1960; Holloway, 1989) that some types of fungi and
bacteria feed on pollen and can cause the destruction of fossil pollen even after all viable cytoplasm has
decayed. Because all six of the soil samples contained numerous types and quantities of fungal spores, it
is reasonable to assume that some of those fungi aided in the destruction of the fossil pollen that was
originally present in these deposits.
In spite of the problems and the potential for differential pollen preservation in these samples we were
requested to attempt to reach a pollen count in at least three of the samples. The three samples selected
were ones that appeared to have sufficient pollen for counting. These three are Samples 5, 39, and 124.
The results of those counts are listed below in Table 2 and a few of the types are illustrated in Figure 1.

Note in Table 2 that most of the pollen comes from types identified by Bryant and Hall (1993) as being
the ones most often found in deposits where oxidation has degraded much of the organic contents,
including many pollen types. In studies conducted in the Big Bend National Park and surrounding areas
of West Texas, Bryant et al. (1994) noted that surface samples averaged about 26,000 pollen grains per
gram of soil while buried samples averaged only 6,000 pollen grains per gram of soil, suggesting that
10,000 pollen grains per gram had oxidized. In addition they found there was an average of 17 different
pollen taxa recovered in each surface sample but after only a few thousand years of age the average
number of fossil pollen taxa recovered were only 7. This suggests that between the time of original
deposition and later recovery there is a loss of about 10 different pollen taxa, or a loss of about 60% of the
original plant record. Under these types of circumstances one must wonder how reliable the resulting data
might be if 60% of the information is missing!
Some of the key pollen types found in these three samples are listed below. They include:
Pinus: Pine trees are one of the most prolific pollen-producing plants known. A single mature pine tree
can produce hundreds of millions of pollen grains, all of which have air bladders that enable the pollen to
be carried vast distances even in light air currents. In air samples collected 1,500 km from the nearest
shoreline in the Mid Atlantic Ocean, the most plentiful type of pollen found is pine pollen. In extensive
studies I conducted of surface samples collected across the state of Washington I discovered that even
when surface soil samples came from areas 60 km from the nearest pine trees, the surface sample still
contained over 30% pine pollen.
Some palynologists have suggested that pine pollen is so plentiful in most surface samples that the correct
image of the tree’s actual importance in the regional vegetation can only be determined by dividing the
recovered percentages of pine pollen by a factor of 100 or more. Why is this information important;

Appendix E-10

because pine pollen was not a major component of these samples? If any pines grew in the region, I
would have expected pine pollen to dominate the types of pollen recovered, which it did not. Most of the
pine pollen was degraded, yet still recognizable. However, it was impossible to tell in most cases if the
pollen was from the pinyon groups or non-pinyon groups of pines.
Cheno-Am: The fossil pollen in this category of plants may have come from a wide variety of species,
many of which are drought resistant and grow well in disturbed or alkaline soils. These are the types of
plants that will often replace grasses, forbs, and even small bushes when environmental conditions
become harsh or after changes such as severe erosion has occurred. Most of these plants produce large
quantities of small and very durable pollen grains that are easily dispersed by the wind. The mature plants
also produce thousands of small seeds, which we know were often gathered and eaten by many
prehistoric and historic cultures living throughout Texas and the American Southwest and northern
Mexico (Feweks 1896; Moerman 1998).
The low percentage of Cheno-Am pollen in these three samples most probably reflects actual amounts
present in the original pollen rain of the region. There is no indication that these pollen grains came from
economic sources resulting from the collection of Chenopodium seeds as food.
Ephedra: Ephedra plants grow well in hot climates where water is at a premium. They can also grow at
various altitudes, which make them a common plant throughout the arid regions of the western portion of
the United States. Ethnographic accounts mention that various species of joint fir (Ephedra) were used by
Native American cultures for medicinal purposes (Coville 1892; Moerman 1998; Stevenson 1915). It is
therefore possible that similar uses for joint fir occurred in the past. Whether or not the few fossil pollen
grains of joint fir found in these samples reflect the ancient, economic use of the plant is not know. I
suspect that the most probable source of these pollen grains is natural and not cultural. It is also important
to remember that Bryant and Hall (1993) note that joint fir (Ephedra) is one of the most durable types of
pollen grains that is able to survive in soils long after many of the fragile pollen types have weathered and
disappeared.
Poaceae: We know from ethnographic reports and from studies of human coprolites found throughout
West Texas and the American Southwest (Bryant and Williams-Dean 1975; Chamberlin 1911; Moerman
1998; Stock 1983; Sobolik 1988) that Native Americans collected and ate various types of grass seeds
such as foxtail barley, wild-rye, Panicum, and millet. All grasses produce wind-pollinated pollen that
would be dispersed into the normal pollen rain of a region. Grass pollen would also be inadvertently
collected during the thrashing of grass stems to recover the seeds. Although it is possible that some of the

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

Appendix E-11

fossil grass pollen found in the soils of these sites may have come from the collection and economic use
of grass or grass seeds, it is more probable that the pollen came from natural sources.
Asteraceae: There are hundreds of species of composites growing throughout the region of West Texas.
Some of those species produce wind-dispersed pollen while the rest produce flowers that are insectpollinated. Sunflowers are one of the composite species that is insect-pollinated and its pollen is included
in the category termed “high spine” because of its surface morphology. Although ethnographic sources
record that a number of composite species were selected and used as food by aboriginal cultures in Texas
and throughout much of western North America (Castetter 1935; Moerman 1998; Palmer 1887),
sunflower plants get the most attention because they were often sought for their seeds, which are rich in
fats and oil (Moerman 1998). However, Bryant and Hall (1993) have noted that composite pollen is one
of the “most durable” pollen types found in the fossil record and that those pollen grains are often the last
ones to deteriorate under unfavorable conditions of preservation. Therefore, as a general rule, when
organic preservation is a problem in soils, composite pollen tends to become “overrepresented” in terms
of its actual relationship to usage or abundance of the plants in the environment.
Miscellaneous pollen types: There are a few other fossil pollen taxa represented in these soil samples but
none of them occur in frequencies other than traces and none suggest any type of economic use.

Typological and Technological Analysis of Earthenware Ceramics
From Site 41VV2013, Val Verde County, Southwest Texas
By
David G. Robinson, Ph.D.
INTRODUCTION
In March and April 2011, a typological and technological analysis was performed on five plain
earthenware potsherds from site 41VV2013 near the city of Del Rio in Val Verde County, southwest
Texas. The purpose of the analysis was to describe the potsherds and assess their cultural and technical
affinities to regional prehistoric ceramics, whether Leon plain ware of central Texas (Suhm, et al. 1954)
or Infierno ceramics of the protohistoric Lower Pecos region (Turpin and Robinson 1998). The
application and influence of Toyah phase ceramic technology on these wares is also of interest.
Site 41VV2013 was encountered in highway right-of-way investigations as part of the Del Rio Outer
Loop project. The earthenware ceramics were returned from the surface or shallow depths, not exceeding
20 cm below the ground surface. Sherd proveniences are given below:

METHODS
The general method of the analysis was inspection of the potsherds in hand specimen. A hand loupe with
multiple lenses granting magnification up to 30X was used to gain most of the observations. Additionally,
Munsell color analysis was conducted on aspects of the ceramic paste. Munsell observations are useful in
detecting differences in firing among ceramics, as heating produces varying colors in clays and ceramic
pastes. Ten variables of the potsherds were investigated and included Munsell color (Exterior Surface,
Interior Surface, Core and Core carbon streak, if any), thickness, edge break, surface finish (exterior and

interior), vessel form, and paste inclusions. Edge break describes the shape of the broken edges of a
potsherd; this shape is a characteristic of the physical properties of any ceramic matrix. Vessel form calls
for an inference on the type of original vessel implied by the shape or other features of the sherd.
RESULTS
The observations of this study are presented in tabular form in Table 2. It may be noted at the outset that
determinations of vessel forms remain elusive, due principally to the small sizes of the sherds. The
collection lacked rims, vessel necks or other features that may have been useful in identifying vessel
types.
The overall finding of the collection is its relative uniformity. Colors were found on the 5YR and 2.5YR
hue pages of the Munsell Soil Color handbook; most descriptive colors were pink or reddish yellow. Four
sherds had carbon streaks, either gray or dark gray. Sherd thicknesses varied narrowly between 4 and 5
millimeters.
Significant variation in the assemblage is seen in the edge break shapes. Only two sherds, 108-U2 and
172-210 have the same shape of their edges (undulating). The other three sherds each have a jagged,
straight or rough edge on their fresh break. The differences in these shapes may be due to physical
properties of the clay matrix, but what these specific properties may be are indeterminable.
Surface finishing has only minor variation; three exteriors are smoothed, one is well-smoothed and one is
semi-polished. Save for one smoothed interior, the interior surfaces are unfinished, as is common in
aboriginal earthenwares.
Paste inclusions are relatively uniform. The ceramic pastes contain limestone and bone as their probable
tempering materials. Four sherds contain hematite, probably a clay resident, and three sherds have traces
of quartz in fine sand and medium sand sizes, also probably naturally occurring in the clay. These
tempering agents and clay residents are common in the region and typical of the regional ceramic
technology.

COMPARISONS AND CONJECTURES
The megascopically observed ceramic attributes and qualitative assessment of paste inclusions give a
close similarity to local ceramics from San Felipe Springs, 41VV414 (Robinson 1999: 183, Table 33).
Those earthenwares, studied petrographically with thin section analysis, also have bone and limestone as
their tempering agents, with crushed bone the primary added component. Based on the evidence, the San
Felipe Springs ceramics were manufactured locally using materials that came immediately to hand,
applying Toyah (Leon plain) ceramic technology. The 41VV2013 ceramics may be interpreted similarly.
The material contrasts between these Del Rio groups of sherds and sites farther west at the mouths of the
Devils River and Pecos River demonstrate other local variations in materials within the Toyah
technological sphere.
The radiocarbon dating of 41VV2013 appears to be later than all but the latest occupations at San Felipe
Springs and contemporary with the chronology of Infierno Camp, 41VV446, near the mouth of the Pecos
(Turpin and Robinson 1998). This may be the most interesting finding of this study, that regionally
varying bone-tempered ceramics persisted well into the protohistoric period and even into the early
Historic Mission period. More in-depth analyses of this collection in the form of petrographic analysis or
neutron activation analysis would not return measurably more information than that already gained; such
studies are not recommended until newer and more fine-grained research questions are brought forward.

Low-powered Light Assisted Microscopic Lithic Use-wear Analysis
Low-powered (40-200X magnification), light assisted microscopy was performed for a select sample of
artifacts from sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 to determine if use-wear was evident in the chipped stone
tool assemblage; and, if observed, document the type and degree of that use-wear. The use of low
powered microscopy has been shown to be reliable for documenting edge damage (Bamforth 1988; Odell
and Odell-Vereecken 1980) and the location of polishes (Keeley 1980; Semenov 1964) although less
reliable in the identification of causes of use-wear striations and polish (i.e., whether an observed polish is
derived from working hide, meat, plants, etc.).
Methods
A significant amount of variation exists in the application of low-power microscope-assisted lithic usewear. This variation derives from many factors but is most normally the result of varied access to
laboratory equipment and comparative lithic use-wear collections (Young and Bamforth 1990). The most
common methods for analyzing chipped stone are provided by Semenov (1964), Keeley (1980), and Odell
and Odell-Vereecken (1980). These researchers provides exhaustive descriptions of microscope types,
strength of magnification, light sources, specimen preparation, use-wear types and variation in
comparative and archaeological examples, as well as techniques for quantifying findings. Similar
information concerning microscopic analysis of groundstone is provided by Adams (1989, 2002).
As discussed in the preceding paragraph, lithic use-wear analyses are normally constrained by equipment
and comparative collections access. This analysis is no different. An Omano Om99 stereo microscope
with a 10-200X magnification and 12 w LED ring light source was utilized for the analysis of the chipped
stone assemblage, although a comparative collection was not available for study.
The surfaces and edges of each tool were analyzed at varying magnifications, light strengths, and angles.
During the inspection, areas of use-wear (i.e., polish and edge damage/modification) were identified and
labeled on a scaled illustration of the analyzed specimen and described. When present, the location of
polish is described as being located on flake crests (i.e., the raised portion of the marginal edges of a flake
scar and the elevated ridge created between two adjoining flake scars as described by Crabtree [1972:56]),
within remnant flake facets/scars, or on an unflaked surface of an artifact.
Identifiable use-wear characteristics displayed by each specimen were compared with the descriptions
provided by Semenov (1964), Keeley (1980), Odell and Odell-Vereecken (1980), and Adams (1989,
2002) to determine possible stone tool function. Discussion of plant polishes is currently
underrepresented in the existing literature, being only briefly discussed by Semenov (1964) and Keeley
(1980). As such Anderson’s (1980) high-powered microscopic analysis of plant polishes and Sobolick’s
(1996) combination residue analysis and high-powered use-wear analysis of organic materials were
consulted to assist in the identification of possible plant polishes.

Appendix H-1

Polish
Areas displaying polish were categorized as having lightly developed polish (visible only under
magnification of 40X or higher), moderately developed polish (polish which may or may not be
macroscopically visible but which becomes evident at magnifications of 10-40X), and heavily developed
polish (polish which is clearly visible macroscopically without magnification). Additional descriptions of
polish include an explanation of where the polish occurred. For example, use of a tool to cut meat or
another soft material can result in polish on an unmodified flake surface, within remnant flake scars, or on
the crests of adjacent flake scars. Polish can also be located on the lateral edge of a tool, extend from the
lateral edge of a tool for varying distances onto unmodified surfaces, or occur on the surface of a tool
without having association with unmodified and/or retouched edges. Description of polishes used to
identify activity and material worked relies heavily on Keeley (1980:60-61), Anderson (1980), and
Sobolick’s (1996).
Edge Modification and Edge Damage
Generally, edge modification and edge damage refers to all macroscopically and microscopically visible
damage to the margins of a tool (Keeley 1980:24-25). Edge modification refers explicitly to tool edges
which were (intentionally or unintentionally) flaked, ground, or otherwise modified from their original
form including modification resulting from use or hafting. Often, edge modification is patterned and will
sometimes display polish resulting from use-wear. Unintentional edge damage refers to non-cultural
impacts to a specimen wherein a tool edge is altered from its intended culturally-created form. This type
of damage can be the result of erosion, animal trampling, mechanical impacts, and/or a variety of other
factors. Edge damage is often unpatterned and can be identified by differential weathering across the
artifact surface. The discussion of edge damage provided herein is an abbreviated version of an analysis
performed by Kay (1999) to identify mechanical edge damage to lithic blades.
While pressure flaking and retouch of many tools is visible macroscopically, micro-flaking (nibbling) is
not readily viewed without magnification (10-100X) and is the product of tool use for the modification of
materials such as wood, bone, plants, animal hides, etc. Activities such as boring, sawing, scraping,
chopping, and adzing can produce micro-flaking which is typically visible only at magnifications greater
than 10X. This study recognizes that micro-flakes may have feathered and/or hinged terminations.
Typically, feathered terminations are created by working soft materials, such as plants and animal
hides/flesh; step terminations are created by working hard materials such as bone and wood. It should be
recognized, however, that it is possible for both types of micro-flake terminations to be generated by a
single activity. An extensive discussion of micro-flaking types and the activities which result in their
development is provided by Keeley (1980:24-25, 35-61).
Effects of Raw Material and Activity Duration on Lithic Use-wear
The type of raw material used to create a tool and the duration that tool is used for a specific activity has a
direct effect on the researcher’s ability to identify use-wear evidence. A tool made of coarse-grained
material will be more resistant to the development of polish, edge modification/damage, and microflaking (i.e., a tool made from a coarser and stronger material will have a stronger edge which is less
Appendix H-2

Archeological Data Recovery at Prehistoric Sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 in the
Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

likely to develop use-wear evidence) regardless of the duration of use. Fine-grained raw materials are
generally weaker than coarse grained materials making them more susceptible to the development of usewear traces. Likewise, a tool used for an extended duration for a singular purpose is far more likely to
display traces of use-wear than one which is discarded after a single use.
The Sample
The entire lithic tool assemblage from sites 41VV2012 and 41VV2013 was analyzed using low-powered
microscopy. Artifact classes included utilized flakes, edge-modified/retouched flakes, unifaces, projectile
points, a butted knife, and a drill/perforator. The analyzed artifacts are described below.
41VV2012
Projectile Point
Specimen 22.1 is manufactured from a pinkish-gray thermally altered fine-grain chert. The only observed
use-wear is located on a single crest near the base of the specimen on one face of the point. This wear is
expressed as subtle rounding and polish of a flake crest that appears to be the result of its attachment to a
haft.
Utilized Flakes
Specimen 1.D1 is a complete flake manufactured from a medium-grained gray chert. Use-wear traces on
this specimen consist of micro-flaking with feathered terminations. The micro-flakes are located on the
dorsal and ventral surfaces along the lateral margins of the flake; however, flake facets are widely spaced
and highly unpatterned. No polish was noted. The overall lack of use-wear on this specimen does not
allow for speculation regarding function or the type of material worked.
Specimen 2.D2 is a complete flake manufactured from a fine-grained white limestone. Use-wear traces on
this specimen include micro-flaking with feathered terminations. The micro-flakes are located on the
dorsal surface along the lateral margins of the flake; however, flake facets are widely spaced and highly
unpatterned. Polish was absent from the surface of the artifact. The overall lack of use-wear on this
specimen does not allow for speculation regarding function or the type of material worked.
Specimen 21.D1 is a complete flake manufactured from a coarse-grained gray chert. Use-wear traces on
this specimen are nearly identical to Specimen 1.D1. Evidence of use-wear is scarce and includes only
micro-flaking with feathered terminations. The micro-flakes are located on the dorsal and ventral surfaces
along the lateral margins; however, flake facets are widely spaced and highly unpatterned. Polish was not
observed on the specimen. The overall lack of use-wear on this specimen does not allow for speculation
regarding function or material worked.

41VV2013
Projectile Points
All twelve projectile points recovered from 41VV2013 were subjected to microscopic analysis to identify
traces of use-wear. Of these, specimens retained evidence of micro-flaking and/or edge rounding polish,
interpreted as use-wear. Lack of obvious impact fractures or evidence of differential weathering or patinas
suggests that none of these were recently fractured due to mechanical disturbances. This data is
summarized in Table VIII.1.

Specimen 5.12 is an Ensor-like dart point which is missing the distal tip which was broken by a snap
fracture. Use-wear is indicated by discontinuous micro-flake scars with step fractured terminations and a
light polish was sporadically observed along both lateral edges. The polish is present only along the flake
crests. The use-wear is indicative of cutting, both hard and soft materials (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 5.13 is an unusually long (28.88 cm) Perdiz arrow point blade fragment which is snapped at its
distal and proximal ends. It is predominantly unifacially flaked yet contains discontinuous micro-flake
scars along the flat ventral face (remnant flake facet). These feathered concavities do not contain evidence
of polish or rounding which are indicative of cutting (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 6.133 is a complete Ensor dart point which is alternately beveled, due to resharpening, creating
sinuous lateral edges and a sharp pointed tip. Slight edge rounding occurs along discontinuous segments
of one lateral edge. This use-wear is likely the result of cutting soft materials (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 7.143 is an almost complete Langtry dart point with heavily resharpened lateral edges giving it
a sinuous and recurved outline. Discontinuous and widely spaced micro-flake scars with accompanying
light polish occurs on one lateral edge. Smoothing of the stem indicates that this dart point was originally
hafted before being resharpened and reutilized as a knife (see Table VIII.1).

Appendix H-5

Specimen 14.149 is a complete Ensor dart point which has been resharpened with alternately beveled
lateral edges culminating into a sharp pointed tip. A series of sequential micro-flake scars with stepped
terminations occur along one lateral edge indicative of cutting activities. Polish and edge rounding were
not observed (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 15.163 is a mostly complete Ensor dart point which is missing its extreme distal tip and one
shoulder. It has been resharpened creating alternately beveled and somewhat sinuous lateral edges.
Discontinuous micro-flake scars occur along both lateral edges; these have feathered terminations without
polish development (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 24.P1 is a Perdiz arrow point which is missing most of its distal end and one barb. The lone
evidence of use-wear is a light polish on one face of the stem, likely a result of hafting (see Table
VIII.1).
Specimen 130.183 is Almagre dart point is missing its distal tip. A series of widely spaced discontinuous
micro-flake scars occur along segments of both lateral edges with feathered terminations. The only
evidence of polish occurs along one side of the tapered stem. Apparently, this dart point was resharpened
and reutilized as a cutting implement (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 130.186 is a complete Frio dart point which exhibits pronounced recurvature of both lateral
edges. A discontinuous series of micro-flake scars with stepped terminations occur along the high points
of the trimmed flake scars. These occur along the high points of the trimmed flake scars sporadically
along both lateral edges. No evidence of polish was observed. This dart point was obviously resharpened
into a knife with use patterns suggestive of cutting semi-hard materials such as plant fibers (see Table
VIII.1).
Specimen 171.MS.P1 is a Figueroa-like dart point with pronounced resharpening of alternately beveled
edges which has given the blade a cork-screw-like twist. As with Specimen 130.186, the micro-flake scars
along the raised crests between trimming flake scars; these flake scars have both feathered and stepped
terminations as well as a discontinuous light polish. This dart point represents reutilization of a dart point
into what is assumed to be a knife used to cut various hard and soft materials (see Table VIII.1).
Butted Knife
Specimen 10.174 is a large and complete tool manufactured from a gray fine-grained chert (see Figure
48). It was initially classified as a chopper based on its morphological appearance; however, upon closer
macroscopic inspection, this tool fits within the ‘Butted Knife Biface” category. Low-powered
microscopy revealed that the prominent edge modifications to the distal edge lacks step fractures and
impact characteristics anticipated for a chopper. Rather, the artifact exhibits a highly developed polish
within flake facets and on flake facet crests that extends from the lateral edges inward for a distance of up
to 30 millimeters on both faces of the tool (see Table VIII.1). Additionally, inspection of the edge
resulted in the discovery of a heavily rounded, worn edge that is consistent with cutting patterns
associated with cutting meat or soft plant materials as described by Keeley (1980).

Drill/Perforator
Specimen 130.188 is a complete drill/perforator manufactured from a tan fine-grained chert. It has a
diamond shaped cross-section and the majority of its surface has been smoothed by abrasion and grinding.
Polish is absent from the artifact, though this may be a function of the raw material type rather than a true
lack of polish. The function of the tool is ascertained from its general form. The lateral degree to which
this item has been smoothed attest to a long or intensive cycle of use, thus making the absence of polish
intriguing. The lateral edge rounding is consistent with working hard materials; however, the specific
material(s) worked and the activities associated with the material remain in question (see Table VIII.1).
Unifaces
Each of the four unifaces from site 41VV2013 was analyzed for microscopic use-wear traces. The
observed use-wear includes polishes, micro-flaking, and possible haft or handheld use-wear.
Specimen 2.131 is a complete unifacial side and end scraper made from a hornfels cobble. It retains a
smoothed cortex with a battered and edge rounded proximal end indicative of pronounced hand held
usage. Use-wear micro-scars are concave with common step fractured terminations likely a result of
scraping nard materials such as tough plant fibers. Polish was not observed (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 6.138 is a complete unifacial side and end scraper manufactured from a fine-grained gray chert.
Use-wear was noted in two locations on the dorsal face. The first area of wear is a small series of microflakes with feathered terminations along one lateral edge. The second is located on the opposing lateral
edge and includes another series of micro-flakes with step fractures. Both areas lack use-wear polish. It is
believed that this tool was briefly used to scrape a hard material. The absence of polish on the artifact
limits the ability to further interpret aspects of use (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 14.148 is a complete unifacial side and end scraper made of a gray chert. Use-wear evidence
was noted on the dorsal face of the proximal bit edge and along both lateral edges. Discontinuous microflake scars with step fractured terminations occur along most of the trimmed edges while edge rounding is
prevalent along both lateral edges. Abrasion of the flakes scars on the proximal end of both the dorsal and
ventral faces is indicative of hafting. Based on the multiple forms of use-wear, it is apparent that this tool
was used to cut and scrape a variety of soft and firm materials such as varying plant materials (see Table
VIII.1).
Specimen 168.204 is mostly complete unifacial side and end scraper manufactured from a translucent
grayish brown fine-grained chert. It is missing approximately one third of its proximal and lateral edges.
Three areas of use-wear were identified during the microscopic analysis. The primary utilization was
observed as well developed polish on the dorsal face along a retouched lateral edge and the distal bit
edge. Based on morphology, the missing lateral edge was likely utilized. Polish is moderately developed
along the flake facets and along the crests between facets. A second area of use-wear occurs as polish
along the unmodified ventral face, perhaps indicative of hafting. Based on the use-wear polish pattern, a
scraping of soft materials such as plants is speculated (see Table VIII.1).

Appendix H-7

Bifaces
Each of the bifaces from site 41VV2013 was analyzed for evidence of use-wear; of these, six exhibit
sporadic micro-flake scarring and/or polish indicative of utilization. Only two of the bifaces are complete,
thus determinations are tentative. Types of breakage among these artifacts consist of snap and radial
fractures ranging from probable manufacturing failures to raw material impurities.
Specimen 5.14 is the proximal end of a Stage IV biface fragment; it is made of thermally-altered (potlids,
crazing, etc.) pinkish gray chert. A rolling hinge fracture occurs across the horizontal midline of the
artifact. This biface fragment displays a discontinuous series of micro-flake scars that are a combination
of concave feathered and step fractured terminations. These tend to occur along the crests created between
the larger trimming flake scars. No evidence of polish was observed. It is likely that the tool served as an
expedient cutting implement, such as a knife (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 5.15 is a small (16.78 cm) distal tip of a very thin (2.59 cm) Stage III biface, very likely the tip
of an arrow point preform. This stem was snapped across the midline and has a series of discontinuous
micro-flake scars along segments of both lateral edges. The micro-flake scars are concave and have both
feathered and step fractured terminations. No evidence of polish was observed. The cause of the breakage
is unknown yet is likely a result of cutting a material unknown at this time .(see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 13.173 is the proximal end of a Stage III biface that has been snapped (rolling hinge fracture)
across the midline. A discontinuous series of concave micro-flake scars with stepped terminations occur
along both remaining lateral edges. No evidence of polish was observed. Based upon the limited tool size
and utilization present it can only be surmised that this unfinished biface was utilized as an expedient
cutting implement, such as a knife (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 15.161 is a thick (14.78cm) distal fragment of a Stage II biface. It is broken by a perverse
fracture and has sinuous lateral edges. A discontinuous series of micro-flake scars with both feathered and
stepped terminations occur along both remaining lateral edges. Polish is present along some of the flake
crests. Based upon the sinuous edges and sporadic pattern of use-wear, it is surmised that this unfinished
biface was expediently utilized as a knife for cutting a variety of hard and soft materials . (see Table
VIII.1).
Specimen 130.187 is a complete Stage II biface manufactured from a grayish brown fine-grained gray
chert. It is plano-convex in cross section with sinuous lateral edges. A discontinuous series of micro-flake
scars having both feathered and stepped terminations occur along both lateral edges. Additional utilization
is evident along the proximal base where a sequential series of unifacial (feathered edged) micro-flake
scars occur along a 15.04 cm area. Based on the unfinished nature of this expedient cutting implement or
knife was likely used for cutting as well as scrapping a variety of materials . (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 171.MS.B2 is a small (3 x 2 cm) medial fragment of a well thinned Stage III biface. It exhibits
proximal and distal hinged fractures and thin, straight lateral edges. A discontinuous series of feathered
edged micro-flake scars occur along one lateral edge. Polish occurs within the scars and the crests of

Appendix H-8

Del Rio Outer Loop, Val Verde County, Texas

adjacent scars. Subtle edge rounding is also present. Based upon the polish and edge rounding a scraping
usage is surmised (see Table VIII.1).
Utilized Flakes
Twelve utilized flakes from site 41VV2103 were inspected using low-powered microscopy. Each of the
specimens displays micro-flaking although very few exhibit polish. Observed patterns of use-wear are
described below.
Specimen 5.17 is a complete flake of brown fine-grained chert. The only observed use-wear was a small
series of micro-flakes with feathered terminations on the dorsal surface of one lateral edge. Although
there is inadequate evidence to address tool use and type of worked material, the presence of micro-flakes
with feathered terminations may indicate the working of a soft material (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 5.23 is a complete flake of fine-grained gray and pinkish-white chert. Use-wear was first noted
on the dorsal surface along one lateral edge where a five-millimeter long series of micro-flake facets with
feathered terminations is visible. The ventral face displays another area of use-wear consisting of a fivemillimeter long series of micro-flake facets with step terminations. This use-wear pattern indicates the
working of a soft material, such as plant resources; and, the working of hard materials (i.e., wood),
respectively. Both use-wear areas lacked evidence of polish (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 5.118 is a complete flake of brownish gray fine-grained chert. Use-wear was noted in two
distinct areas. Although located on opposing faces of the artifact, the use-wear patterns are identical. The
microscopically visible use-wear consists of lightly developed polish within micro-flake facets, as well as
on the crests created by those facets. The polish extends from the lateral edge inward for approximately
two millimeters into unmodified parts of the specimen. Additionally, Also visible along the tool edge is a
microscopic abrasion/rounding that has partially worn down the crests of the existing micro-flake facets.
Based on the presence and location of polish and edge rounding, it is presumed that this tool was used for
cutting soft material such as fibrous plants (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 9.147 is a flake fragment of fine-grained gray chert. Use-wear evidence is limited to the ventral
surface of one lateral edge. Although polish is absent, several deep micro-flakes with feather terminations
were noted. Several of the micro-flakes are oriented approximately 45° from the edge, suggesting that the
tool was drawn or pushed in a single direction. Based on the orientation of the micro-flakes, the size of
the micro-flakes, and their termination, Specimen 9.147 closely resembles Keeley’s (1980:45) results for
sawing bone. However, no prehistoric bone (much less altered bone) was recovered so it is plausible that
the artifact was used for unidirectional cutting of wood or woody plants (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 14.152 is a flake fragment manufactured of fine-grained tan chert. Use-wear is limited to a
small series of micro-flakes with featured terminations located on the ventral surface of one lateral edge.
Polish was absent from this artifact. The minimal amount of use-wear precludes a discussion of tool
activity or type of material worked (see Table VIII.1).

Appendix H-9

Specimen 15.156 is a complete flake of gray coarse-grained chert. Use-wear varied greatly and occurred
in multiple areas on both the dorsal and ventral face of the artifact. The first polished area appears on the
crests created by flake facets; these were created by retouch on the dorsal surface. This polish extends
inward approximately two millimeters from the lateral edge and occurs within a 15-millimeter long area
of the lateral edge. The second area also displays lightly developed polish located on the dorsal face of
one lateral edge; a series of random micro-flake facets with step terminations occur in conjunction with
the polish. A third area of polish is visible on the dorsal face just above the first described polish. The
final and fourth area of use-wear is located on the ventral face and exhibits a moderately developed polish
confined to a one millimeter along the lateral edge (see Table VIII.1). Based on the patterning of usewear traces on this tool, it is presumed to have been used for scraping a hard material such as wood
(Keeley 1980).
Specimen 62.F1 is a complete flake of fine-grained pink, brown, and light tan banded chert. Use-wear
evidence is minimal, exhibiting several widely spaced micro-flakes with feathered terminations occurring
on the dorsal face of one lateral edge (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 102.F1 is a flake fragment of dark reddish-gray fine-grained chert. Similar to Specimen 62.F1,
use-wear evidence is minimal with spaced micro-flakes with feathered terminations occurring on the
lateral margins of the dorsal face (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 138.F1 is a complete flake manufactured from a brownish-gray fine-grained chert. Evidence of
use-wear was limited to a 10 millimeter long portion along one lateral edge. The traces consist of a series
of micro-flakes with step terminations located on the dorsal face. The crests between the micro-flake
facets are covered by a very light polish. The micro-flake facets and light polish are consistent with
Keeley’s (1980:35-49) evidence for working hard materials (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 163.F1 is a flake fragment made of fine-grained gray chert. This is one of very few specimens
that display flake scar patterns similar to those described by Keeley (1980:24) as “half-moon breakages”.
The half-moon breakage pattern occurs on the ventral and dorsal face along one lateral worked edge in an
area measuring 15 millimeters in length. Typically, this type of breakage occurs during the sawing of
wood, although it can also occur during other activities performed on hard materials. No polish or
additional use-wear traces are evident on this artifact although the edge damage noted on the ventral face
included flake facets with step, hinge, and feather terminations that contained evidence of differential
weathering and patination. Although the sawing of wood seems unlikely the utilization of other hard
materials (e.g., wood) is more plausible (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 168.208 is a complete flake manufactured from a fine to coarse-grained brown and gray chert.
Micro-flakes with feathered terminations were observed on one lateral edge of the dorsal face within a 15
millimeter long area. The crests between flake scars display a light polish; although the raw material
made it difficult to distinguish polish from the natural luster of the stone. Similar flake scars lacking
polish were visible on the ventral surface of the same lateral edge. Based on the polish and feathered
terminations of the micro-flakes, it is speculated that Specimen 168.208 was used to cut soft materials
such as plant material (see Table VIII.1).

Appendix H-10

Specimen 171.MS.F2 is a complete flake manufactured from a thermally altered pinkish-gray and brown
banded fine-grained chert. Several micro-flakes with feathered termination were noted along the dorsal
face within a 25 millimeter long portion of one lateral edge. The ventral surface displays similar microflaking although the facets were spaced further apart and were not sequential. The lack of additional
evidence of use-wear limits the interpretation of activity and function for this tool although it is presumed
to have been used for cutting a soft material (see Table VIII.1).
Edge Modified Flakes
A total of nine edge modified/retouched flakes were subjected to a low-powered microscopic analysis. All
but one specimen (Specimen 83.178) has clear traces of use-wear including polish development, microflaking, and edge rounding.
Specimen 5.79 is secondary flake fragment manufactured of a brownish gray coarse-grained chert. This
relatively thick (14.59 mm) fragment has a snap fracture along its proximal end and a rolling hinge
fracture at the distal end. The only intact lateral edge is bifacially trimmed along its entire length with
flake scars that predominantly terminate with a step fracture. Polish is moderately developed along both
faces occurring within the flake facets as well as along the flake crests. The polish also extends beyond
the flake scar margin, from the lateral edge towards the flakes vertical midline, for a distance of
approximately 8.4 mm. This expedient tool is interpreted as a knife fragment, likely broken during use.
Based on the micro-step fracturing and polish which occur beyond the flake margins, this artifact was
likely utilized as a cutting tool for hard and soft materials (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 5.110 is a large (10 x 5 cm) and thick (17.33 cm) secondary flake manufactured from a gray
coarse-grained chert. Unifacial trimming was observed almost the entire length of one lateral edge of the
dorsal face (74.54 mm) with sporadic and widely discontinuous micro-flake scars on the ventral face. The
ventral scars are believed to represent use-wear rather than intentional flake removal. Most of the flake
scars (both feathered and step fractured) retain a light polish along their crests. The coarse grained
material may be responsible for the poor polish development. This edge modified flake is interpreted as a
hand held knife utilized to cut and possibly scrape a variety of both hard and soft materials (see Table
VIII.1).
Specimen 20.T1 is a tertiary flake fragment manufactured from a light gray fine-grained chert. Only one
area of use-wear was noted on this specimen; it was observed along the retouched lateral edge of the
dorsal face. The observed use-wear includes micro-flake facets with step terminations along with a lightly
developed polish covering the crests created by adjacent flake facets. The use-wear pattern on is
consistent with Keeley’s (1980:38, 44) description of similar patterns on tools used for scraping wood
(see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 62.F2 is a secondary flake manufactured from a fine grained dark gray hornfels. Unifacial
trimming along one lateral edge of the ventral face resulted in micro-flake scars with step fractured
terminations, as well as light polish along their crests. Based on this use-wear, the flake tool was utilized
as a scraper of an unspecified array of both hard and soft materials (see Table VIII.1).

Appendix H-11

Specimen 83.178 is a large secondary flake fragment manufactured from a dark brownish gray chert
medium-grained chert. The specimen retains cortex on its dorsal face and has a flat ventral face, as if
made from a split cobble. Extensive bifacial trimming was observed along the entire length of one lateral
edge while discontinuous, unifacial micro-flake scars occur sporadically along the dorsal face of the
opposing lateral edge. The occurrence of snap fractures, both proximally and distally, preclude a
definitive determination of tool type although it is representative of a knife. Edge polish was not evident.
Because the micro-step fractures were adjacent to feathered terminations, it is surmised that this expedient
tool was utilized on both hard and soft materials (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 86.181 is a tertiary flake fragment manufactured from a grayish brown, opaque fine-grained
chert. The proximal and distal ends are both broken by snap fractures. Use-wear was observed along
alternate lateral edges of both the dorsal and ventral faces. The dorsal face has the most extensive edge
trimming (unifacial) along a 26.86 cm long area. Edge rounded polished (20.36 cm long) was observed on
the ventral face. Based on the presence of one modified lateral edge (lacking polish or feathered
terminations); as well as, an area of extensive edge rounding, this expedient tool likely functioned as a
cutting and scraping tool (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 130.200 is a unique crescent shaped secondary flake fragment, which was reworked from a
much larger flake. This expedient tool was predominantly unifacially trimmed along one lateral edge of
the dorsal face with a relatively small (23 cm) bifacially trimmed distal tip. The trimmed edge extends
almost the entire length of the flake (60.09cm) and contains a unique mixture of larger step fractured flake
margins with much smaller feathered and step fractured micro-flake margins. The patterning of large and
small flake fractures most likely represents multiple use events of hard and soft materials. Polish is
moderately developed at flake margins and along the crests between each flake scar. The location of the
polish in flake facets and its high luster suggests that this tool was likely used to cut a soft material such
as plants. Alternately, the step fracture micro-scars seem to suggest use on harder materials (see
Table VIII.1).
Specimen 168.202 is a complete blade flake made of a light gray coarse grained chert. It has a length of
75.33 cm and exhibits unifacial trimming along one entire lateral edge of the dorsal face. Additionally,
the distal end is completely trimmed. The micro-flake scars consist of a combination of feathered and step
terminations with the latter displaying larger remnant facets. Polish was not observed. Edge damage in the
form of micro-flakes with step and feathered terminations is consistent with Keeley’s (1980: 38-40)
suggested usage for scraping or cutting of hard materials such as wood. Based on the site type, short term
campsite, and the assemblage as a whole, it is more likely that specimen 168.202 was a multifunctional
hand-held knife (see Table VIII.1).
Specimen 171.MS.F1 is a complete blade flake manufactured from a thermally modified pinkish-gray
chert. Trimming and use-wear is evident along its entire length (88.89 cm) of both dorsal and ventral
faces as well as along both lateral edges. The majority of the trimming occurs along one (unifacial) lateral
edge of the dorsal face; tiny pressure flake scars (trimming) occur in sequential order. These scars retain
feathered terminations and pronounced edge rounding and sheen. The opposite lateral edge of the dorsal
face displays discontinuous and nonsequential flake scars suggestive of utilization damage rather than

intentional trimming. The ventral face retains similar discontinuous flake scars with concave feathered
terminations and lacked evidence of polish. The variable nature of edge damage and polish is likely a
reflection of multiple functions, such as scraping or cutting of soft materials, such as fresh hide or meat
and/or scraping harder materials such as wood and/or stout plant stems (see Table VIII.1).
Conclusions
The results of the low-powered microscopic use-wear analysis are relatively inconclusive. An expected
pattern of cutting and scraping of a variety of soft and hard materials is apparent. The prevalent
reutilization of tools such as projectile points and bifaces in tasks in which they were presumably not
intended is intriguing. This pattern is likely a reflection of a lack of readily available raw lithic material
and the maximization of a mobile tool kit.
