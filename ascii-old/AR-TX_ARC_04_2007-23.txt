ABSTRACT
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of approximately 1,200 feet of proposed nature trail extension
reroute along West Mud Creek for the City of Tyler which is located in
Smith County, Texas. The proposed trail extension reroute located about
1,200 feet north/northeast of the Grande Boulevard Expansion and east of
Mud Creek which is located east of Broadway Street (US 69). The
archaeological survey was conducted for MHS Planning & Design, Inc.
which is designing the trail and performing the environmental permitting
for the City of Tyler. Since the City of Tyler is a political entity of the
State of Texas, and funds will be received from the Texas Department of
Transportation, Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4420 was received from
the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission to perform
the survey.
No archaeological sites were found during the archaeological survey and
no historic residences were found on the 1915 Soil Conservation map.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted.
If, however, buried cultural resources are uncovered during construction,
work should stop in that area and the Texas Historical Commission be
notified as well as the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of
Engineers. Work should not continue until the necessary investigations
have been conducted after consultation with the proper authorities.

INTRODUCTION
During July, 2005, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of approximately 6.25 miles of nature trail in southern Tyler which is located in
Smith County, Texas (Todd 2005). The survey was done for MHS Planning & Design,
Inc. which was designing the trail and performing the environmental permitting for the
City of Tyler. After the survey was conducted and the report accepted by the Texas
Historical Commission, land owner issues developed which necessitated a reroute of
approximately 1,200 linear feet which is located about 1,200 feet north/northeast of the
Grande Boulevard Expansion and east of Mud Creek which is located east of US 69 or
Broadway Street (Figure 1). AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the approximately 1,200 feet reroute on February 20, 2007 for
MHS Planning & Design, Inc. which is designing the trail as well as performing the
environmental permitting for the City of Tyler
The Texas Antiquities Code applies to this investigation since the City of Tyler is a
political entity of the State of Texas and also the City will receive funding from the Texas
Department of Transportation. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission will review this report. Since West Mud Creek and an intermittent drainage
are within and adjacent to the proposed trail extension, possible relevant federal
legislation includes the National Historic Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 PL-90-190) and the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291). This report was written in
accordance with the guidelines for letter reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (N.D.).

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Smith County is located in northeastern Texas and two-thirds of the county is covered in
post oak, blackjack oak and tall grasses while the remaining third is heavily forested with
pine and hardwoods. Soils vary from sandy prairie loams in the northwestern and eastern
parts of the county to loam-covered clays in the remainder (McCrosky 2007:1). West
Mud Creek is mapped as perennial on both the USGS and Soil Conservation maps and is
mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium.
The underlying geology of the entire area is the Sparta City Sand which is Eocene in age
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1965). This formation is composed of quartz sand and
clay along with concretions and ledges of ironstone and ferruginous sandstone.
The proposed trail route is within the Mantachie Soil Associations which consists of
loams and clay loams found on floodplains (Hatherly 1993: General Soil Map). Specific
soils in the study area consist of frequently flooded Mantachie loam (Hatherly 1993:Sheet
37).

The study area is located in the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest plant community which is
part of the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987:
Figure 1) and is part of the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950:Figure 1). Major
timber trees are pine, oak, hickory, cedar elm, and sweet gum. Other hardwood
associations are found in low, wet bottomlands. Understory vegetation includes green
briar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, wild grape, crape myrtle, dogwood, and many other
species.

CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
To summarize the archaeology of Smith County, it has been shown that settlement began
some time during the Late Archaic period (Story 1981; Story and others 1990). Evidence
has been shown of Early Ceramic occupation before A.D. 700 in Several sites have
Caddoan pottery indicative of the Alto focus which is the early part of the Late
Prehistoric Period while most of the prehistoric sites date to the Frankston focus during
the second half of this period which ends by A.D. 1700. No evidence of historic Native
American settlement has been reported in the immediate area (Perttula 1992:177),

although Indian groups are reported in the region during the 1800s. It should be noted
that the Gilbert site is upstream within the Sabine River Watershed.
Historic European settlement in Smith County began in the early 1800s. In fact, the
Neches Saline [Brooks Saline] to the south and Steen Saline east of Lindale provided salt
for the Trans-Mississippi South during the Civil War. Early settlers to the area found
plentiful resources. The most valuable resource was water and the city of Tyler owes its
placement to the abundant springs in the area (McCrosky 2007:1-2).
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007), site 41SM342 was recorded
approximately 270 meters northeast of the proposed trail reroute on a terrace overlooking
the creek. The site consisted of an Archaic site from which dart points were collected.
The site was found by Sam Whiteside in the 1950s and an update was provided by Mark
Walters, Texas Archeological Steward for Smith County, in 2001. He mentions that the
site is now under a house. No residences were shown in the study area on the 1915 Smith
County Soil Map.
AR Consultants, Inc. (2005) conducted an archaeological survey west and north of West
Mud Creek for a trail for the City of Tyler. A lithic piece each was found in two shovel
tests outside the proposed trail right-of-way on a knoll. No other cultural materials were
found in the other sixteen shovel tests along the creek.

METHODOLOGY
The proposed trail reroute is to be 10 feet wide, 1,200 feet long and made of concrete.
Minimal excavation, less than 30 cm, will be done to anchor the concrete trail. A 100 foot
wide right-of-way was examined by walking transects 30 meters apart. The survey of the
proposed right-of-way was extended to determine if any archaeological sites might be
impacted by travel off the trail. Surface exposure mainly was less than 10 percent in the
floodplain but ranged to 50 percent in places. Eye-height visibility, the ability to see a
standing feature (well, chimney, etc.) or a standing structure, was good throughout most
of the study area Shovel tests were placed at least 75 meters apart although 100 meters is
recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). The sandy loam was
screened through a Â¼-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests were excavated to at least 30 cm
below the surface because that would be the depth of the impact and supplemented by
augering where possible. Previous experience has indicated that artifacts may be deeply
buried. Backhoe trenching was not done during this survey. This was due to the following
factors. First, the depth to the subsoil was listed as shallow in the soils book for Smith
County and the shallow impact.

RESULTS
This chapter contains a discussion of the survey area and the survey. Shovel tests are
described generally in the text and specific information can be found in the table at the
end of the chapter. Shovel test locations are shown on Figure 1.

The proposed trail extension reroute is located in a generally level floodplain. Sandy
loam was present on the surface. Trees include pine, hackberry, sweetgum and bois dâarc.
Understory vegetation includes Johnson grass, saw greenbriar, grape vine, poison oak and
ivy and native bushes. The floodplain setting, vegetation and staked trail is shown in
Figure 2. A tributary to West Mud Creek crosses the proposed trail. The tributary is about
2 meters deep and a meter wide. Clear water was flowing in a loamy sand substrate at the
time of the survey.

trail. View is the south.

Shovel test 1 was placed about 75 meters south of where the trail began. The shovel test
encountered 43 centimeters of silty clay overlying another silty clay that extended to 71
centimeters below the ground surface. This silty clay was underlain by a very fine sandy
loam that extended to 103 centimeters which was underlain by another silty clay that
extended to 121 centimeters. The shovel test was terminated at 121 centimeters below the
ground surface when a tree root was encountered. Shovel test 2 uncovered the same soil
matrices but the horizons were at 45, 74 and 105 centimeters, respectively. The shovel
test was terminated at 133 centimeters below the ground surface.
Shovel test 3 encountered 47 centimeters of very fine sandy loam overlying mottled
sandy loam that extended to 55 centimeters. Below the mottled sandy loam is a very fine
sandy loam that ranged to 100 centimeters which overlaid a different very fine sandy
loam that extended to 154 centimeters below the ground surface, the depth at which the
shovel test was terminated. Shovel test 4 uncovered 43 centimeters of very fine sandy

loam overlying clayey sand that extended to 58 centimeters below the ground surface.
The shovel test was terminated when a tree root was encountered. No shovel tests were
placed along the Grande Boulevard Extension due to prior disturbance from road
construction.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant cultural materials were discovered on the ground during the pedestrian
archaeological survey or in the shovel tests of the proposed trail route extension. The lack
of both prehistoric and historic archaeological sites is probably due to the seasonal
flooding of West Mud Creek. Terraces overlooking the drainage probably were occupied
similar to site 41SM342. Artifacts found in the prior survey were in locations above
flooding.
Based upon the absence of significant cultural materials and the prior disturbances, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted. If buried cultural resources are uncovered during construction in any locale
within the tract, all work should cease in that area and the Texas Historical Commission
and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified. Work
should not continue until the necessary investigations have been conducted after
consultation with the proper authorities.
