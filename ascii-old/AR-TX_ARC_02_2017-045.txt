ABSTRACT
The City of Sanger is planning to construct approximately 2.4 miles of new sewer
pipeline and a new lift station in Denton County, Texas. The project consists of
approximately 4,300 feet (0.8 mi) of gravity pipeline and approximately 8,400 feet
(1.6 miles) of force main pipeline. A 100-foot-wide survey corridor was surveyed
for the pipelines, as well as a 100 ft buffer around the proposed lift station for a
combined total acreage of approximately 30 acres. No archaeological sites or
artifacts were found in the shovel tests, on the surface, nor in the backhoe trenches
excavated. Field documents, photos, and other paperwork from this survey will be
curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University.
As such, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and requests that that Texas Historical Commission
concur with this assessment. However, if artifacts or features are found during
construction, work should stop immediately and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission should be notified before work resumes.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Sanger is planning to construct approximately 2.4 miles of new sewer pipeline and a
new lift station in Denton County, Texas (Figure 1). The project is located on the south side of
Sanger, Texas. The project consists of approximately 4,300 feet (0.8 mi, 18-24â diameter with an
8-15â depth of cover) of gravity pipeline that will extend from an existing lift station on the west
side of Cowling Road (Figure 2) southeast to the proposed lift station on the south side of Railroad
Ave and Rector Road. The gravity pipeline is situated in the floodplain of Clear Creek, which
ultimately drains into the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. From the new lift station a new force main
pipeline will be built along the east side of Railroad Ave north to the existing wastewater treatment
plant. The force main pipeline is approximately 8,400 feet long (1.6 miles, 12â diameter with a 5â
depth of cover) and will be built on the private property side parallel to Railroad Ave. A 100-footwide survey corridor will be used for the pipelines, while a 100 ft buffer around the proposed lift
station was surveyed for a combined total acreage of approximately 30 acres. Railroad Ave
separates the proposed pipeline from the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (now the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe) Railroad tracks. The gravity pipeline will be directionally drilled under the
railroad line and the roads. Alan Plummer Associates, Inc., (APAI) contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an archaeological survey of the Sanger Pipeline and Lift
Station project area.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Sanger is a state entity and
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7971 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant
legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter
191). The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) will review this report
on behalf of the State.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of the
THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of
the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed
in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes
with recommendations followed by the references cited and an appendix.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the Eastern
Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county is covered by the black soil of the Fort Worth
Prairie in which the study area lies and the eastern part consists of the rich, black soil of the
Blackland Prairie. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and several major
creeks (Odom 2003).
The Lower Cretaceous-aged undifferentiated Denton Clay, Weno Limestone and Pawpaw
Formation underlie the majority of the project area to the north (the force main pipeline), as well
as the undifferentiated Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek Formation within the same area.
The gravity pipeline and proposed lift station are mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium and
the area just north of the lift station is mapped as a Quaternary terrace (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1967).
Bedrock decomposition and pedogenesis in the study area have resulted in creation of the soil
associations known as the Sanger-Somervell which consists of gently sloping to moderately steep
upland prairie clays and loams (Ford and Pauls 1980: General Soil Map). A variety of soils are
present in the study area but Medlin-Sanger stony clays with 5 to 15 percent slopes, Sanger clay
with 1 to 5 percent slopes, and Ponder loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes are the predominant soils
that parallel Railroad Ave in the northern sections of the pipeline route while Wilson clay loam
with 0 to 3 percent slopes are present in the area of the proposed lift station. The segment west of
Railroad Ave and north of Clear Creek is mapped as frequently flooded Frio silty clay.
The project area is situated in the Clear Creek floodplain and on the interfluve between Clear Creek
and Ranger Branch. Clear Creek lies approximately 400-500 meters to the south and is perennial;
this drains to the Elm Fork of Trinity River approximately 8 miles southeast. Ranger Branch is
mapped as an intermittent stream on the Soil Conservation Service and the USGS maps. This
second-order drainage is just east of the project area, approximately 100 meters from the northern
end and 1 kilometer from the southern end, and drains to Clear Creek approximately 2 miles to the
southeast.
According to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope. Certainly, deer
inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not present in the immediate survey area.
The regional paleoenvironment has been summarized by Ferring and Yates (1998:27-29). Prior to
11,000 years ago, the climate was warmer and drier but this changed to being wet and cooler
between 11,000 and 7,500 years ago. This was a period of rapid alluviation which did not allow
for the preservation of buried occupation surfaces. Alluviation slowed for the ensuing 2,500 years
and this drier period resulted in pedogenesis which preserved some stratified Middle Archaic
occupation deposits. Regional rainfall increased between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago and this
resulted in moderate to rapid alluviation and the preservation of briefly occupied surfaces but not
the development of stable soils. Many Late Archaic site deposits have been found in these
sediments. Pedogenesis resume and lasted for the next 1,000 years during the dry climate. The
West Fork Paleosol dates to this period. Over the last 1,000 years, the climate has been wetter than
the present with moderate alluviation.

CULTURAL HISTORY
A definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin and North Central Texas
has been difficult to establish for several reasons. Many sites are not vertically stratified because
bioturbation has impacted stratified deposits, and plowing has mixed artifacts in shallowly buried
deposits. However, deep Holocene alluviation preserves buried occupation surfaces, both in the
Holocene as at the Rough Green (41TR162) and Dalby (41DL350) sites and in the Pleistocene,
such as at the Aubrey site (41DN479) (Ferring 2001). Without alluviation, these sites would have
remained surface deposits, likely with no contextual integrity. Plowing usually mixes together
artifacts that exist within 15 centimeters (cm) of the surface (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:5).
However, for the purpose of this report, a prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl (1990), with an
added historic period and a divided Late Prehistoric, for North Central Texas is presented below
to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the culture history of the region.
Table 1. Cultural Chronology.

Archaic
6,000 to A.D. 700.
Paleoindian
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C..
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least 10,000 years ago as
attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook and Harris 1957) and the
Aubrey Clovis site. Nevertheless, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom,
Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region (Bever and Meltzer
2007). The presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people
traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw
material trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game, but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000-6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as A.D. 700800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the areas but particularly along the major and minor
stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods. Dart points, grinding stones,
fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic
peoples continued making and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a
shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as
Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Small lithic scatters have been recorded
in upland areas throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been
thoroughly studied and their relationship to the Lake Lewisville sites is uncertain.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF SANGER PIPELINE AND LIFT STATION

About A.D. 700-800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning of the
prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.
This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries (Prikryl 1990). During this period,
which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears as trade material
along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested that farming may have been
practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and apparently, the bow and arrow had been
added to the hunting tools.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general abandonment of the
north-central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade goods that might have been
obtained from French, Spanish or English traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is
tied to a general drying trend and attempts to factor in negative information generated by
professional and avocational archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys
throughout the region (Peter et al. 1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native
American occupation anywhere in the region although historic accounts indicate that groups were
present in the early 1800's.
The history of European presence in North Central Texas continues with the first written accounts
by the French and Spanish explorers. There is tantalizing evidence to the south in Dallas County
of possible visits by Spanish explorers (Crook 1988:109; Bruseth 1992:81-82). Current research,
however, seems to indicate that Anglo settlers in the 1800âs were the first non-Indians to visit the
survey area.
Established European settlement in Denton County began in the mid-1800's with the establishment
of the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were farmers who selected
bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity in the county. The town of Little Elm was established
with a post office in 1845 (Bridges 1978). Commercial farming was not important until after the
Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially self-sufficient. Besides the plants and animals
they raised, wild animals and plants were commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat
in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were
grown by tenant farmers who either paid rent to the landowner for their house, tools, and seed or
by tenants who gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash
crops. Sanger was founded in 1886 as a stop on the Santa Fe Railroad. The Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad spans hundreds of miles across the country, and is still actively running today as the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. This railroad cuts through and parallels the project area.
By the turn of the century, all of the major communities had been established and some had passed
away. Educational institutions have always been important to growth, and the North Texas State
College, now known as the University of North Texas, was established in Denton in the 1890s,
while the school now known as Texas Womanâs University opened for classes in 1903 (Odom
2016). Though these schools are in Denton, their influence spread to the surrounding areas
including Sanger.
Previous Investigations
A search of TASA (2017) located no historical markers, cemeteries, National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), or archaeological sites within the
survey area. A historical marker for Sanger Cemetery, however, is located approximately 0.3 mi

northeast of the study area. Also, four historical markers between 0.5 and 1 mile from the northern
extent of the project area include (in order from closest to farthest): Galilee Missionary Baptist
Church, Sanger and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, Sanger Presbyterian Church, and
the Jacob Frederick Elsasser House.
Four surveys have been conducted within a mile of the project area. Geoarch Consultants
conducted a linear survey in 1997 that passes through the project area, though no sites were
recorded (Ferring 1997). The Soil Conservation Service conducted a survey in 1987 within the
project area, but did not identify any sites. A mile north of the project area in 2017, TxDOT
conducted a survey for road improvements but also did not identify any sites. Additionally, ARC
conducted a survey of the Clear Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant project area, which overlaps
with the proposed Lift Station of the current project area (Todd 2008). ARC has also conducted a
few other surveys of interest within 5 kilometers of the current study area (Trask and Skinner 2002;
Todd 2005 and 2008). Trask and Skinner (2002) surveyed along Hackberry Branch and Stewart
Creek and did not record any prehistoric or historic sites despite the presence of a consistent,
perennial water source. Todd (2005 and 2008) surveyed along Clear Creek and also did not record
any prehistoric or historic sites despite the presence of a consistent, perennial water source, though
isolated occurrences of prehistoric artifacts were observed. Based off of the results from these
surveys, it was concluded that the current project area is unlikely to have buried cultural deposits.
Three historic maps were examined prior to field work; these include the 1918 USDA Denton
County Soils Map, the 1936 General Highway Map (GHM) of Denton County, and the 1959 GHM
of Denton County. All three maps show that no structures were built in or adjacent to the study
area. Aerial photographs from 1952, 1969, 1981, 1995, and 2015 show that only a handful of
structures have been built within the study area in recent decades. These are in the sewer treatment
plant at the northeast end of the proposed force main pipeline, and were built after 1975, judging
by photorevisions to the Sanger, TX 7.5â USGS map. Aside from demonstrating a near absence of
structures, the aerial photographs show land use in the study area from the mid-20th century
onward. In general, the fertile land adjacent to the Clear Creek and Ranger Branch has been kept
as a patchwork of plowed fields, which have been terraced on the slopes adjacent to the floodplain.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that there was low potential for encountering prehistoric sites, even in consideration
the project areaâs setting and access to water year-round. The survey and site data reviewed does
not show many sites being found in this area around Clear Creek. However, buried prehistoric site
may be found in the floodplain or along the interfluve between it and Ranger Branch.
The second hypothesis stated that there was low potential for encountering historic sites within the
project area. A few structures are shown on aerials around the project area in recent decades, but
historic maps suggest few in the area. While historic maps and aerials demonstrate that the mapped
structures are not likely to be found, historic trash scatters and features such as foundations,
cisterns, wells, and trash associated with the former historic structures may be present within the
survey area.

Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field personnel
walked a transect along the centerline of the survey area. Shovel tests were placed where ground
visibility was less than 30-percent and the ground surface was not heavily disturbed. In areas that
were disturbed, or had existing features, shovel testing was not conducted and the pre-plotted
shovel tests were skipped, as detailed below. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. Sandy loam
from the shovel tests was screened through Â¼-inch mesh hardware cloth. When clay fill was
encountered, it was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if
cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition,
texture, and color. A backhoe was used to excavate trenches in the floodplain along the proposed
route. Trenches were stepped to OSHA standards. The clay fill was inspected visually and broken
into smaller chunks to determine if cultural materials were present. Additionally, all walls, floors,
benches, and back dirt were examined for cultural materials. Trench matrices were described based
on composition, texture, and color (Vogel 2002). The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2010) was used
to identify soil colors. The authors made notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types,
and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using
a 16-megapixel, digital camera. Shovel test and project boundary locations were marked with a
handheld Garmin GPS.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first describes the project areaâs setting along with
results of the pedestrian survey. The second presents the findings of the backhoe trenching.
Conclusions derived from the investigation end the chapter. Although shovel tests are described
generally within the text, more detailed descriptions are in Appendix A.
Survey Results
The Sanger pipeline project area spans several settings: the gravity pipeline sits within the
floodplain of Clear Creek, while the lift station is located on the upland slope, and the force main
crosses on upland terrace sediments. The vegetation in the area consists of grasses and recently
harvested sorghum in agriculturally active pastures, as well as a few pecan and bois dâarc trees
along property boundaries and fence lines (Figure 3). Generally, the pipeline route and lift station
area had a ground visibility of 10- to 50-percent due to ankle-high grasses and weeds.

Figure 3.

A total of 45 shovel test (ST) locations were visited along the pipeline route and are numbered and
described from northeast to southwest (Figure 4). Shovel tests (STs) 1-9 were not excavated due
to their location within an existing sewer line easement or gravel/grass parking lot (Figure 5), as
well as STs 30-31 due to their location within a modern debris dump in the area of the proposed
lift station (Figure 6). This debris includes concrete, asphalt, PVC pipe fragments, and metal rod
fragments. Additionally, ST 45 was not excavated due to its location within an existing lift station
(Figure 7).

A total of 34 shovel tests were excavated, all in pasture settings. STs 10-27 were excavated along
the proposed force main, paralleling Railroad Ave. STs 28-29 were excavated south of Rector Rd
within the area of the proposed lift station, while STs 32-44 were excavated throughout pastures
along the proposed gravity pipeline. Generally, the soil profiles consisted of a 30- to 80-cm-thick
A horizon of black/brown to very dark grayish brown sandy loam to compact clay. This A horizon
was generally underlain by mottled clay subsoil ranging in color from brown/yellowish brown to
gray/black. Differences in soil profiles included ST10 encountering limestone bedrock at 20 cmbs,
STs 12-15 and 33-34 subsoil containing 10- to 20-percent calcium carbonate concretions (1-9
mm), and ST 36 subsoil containing 20-percent manganese concretions. No cultural resources were
found in any of the excavated shovel tests or on the ground surface. Additionally, no evidence of
old creek channels or West Fork Paleosol were observed
Trenches
Three backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated along the proposed pipeline route (Figure 4). The
trenches were excavated along the gravity pipeline route to examine subsurface deposits in the
floodplain that will be impacted by pipeline construction. Each trench was ten to twelve meters
long and, from the first bench to the sheer profile wall, one to three meters wide. Depth ranged
between 310 and 320 cmbs. In general, trenches were placed within the area mapped as the
floodplain of Clear Creek. Within individual trenches the profiles were consistent. As such, one
profile was recorded for each trench.
The profiles exposed during trenching were generally consistent with the Sanger clay and
frequently flooded Frio clay soils that are mapped by the Natural Resources Conservation Service
within the Clear Creek floodplain (Figure 8). All three BHTs were 450 to 600 m north of the main

Clear Creek channel and all shared a similar soil profiles. These also correspond closely to the soil
profiles observed in the shovel tests. Zones 3-5 showed 2- to 10-percent calcium carbonate (1-3
mm nodules), beginning at approximately the 2-meter mark and increasing with depth. BHT2
contained Rabdotus genus snail shells in zones 1 and 2. No cultural resources were observed in
the trench walls, floors, or in the backdirt excavated from the trenches. There was also no evidence
of old creek channels or West Fork Paleosol observed in the trenches.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF SANGER PIPELINE AND LIFT STATION

Conclusions
No archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the survey. This was predicted
regarding historic cultural resources due to the absence of mapped structures. Though it was
predicted in the Research Design of this document that prehistoric sites might be found in the
project area given its proximity to Clear Creek, none were identified during the survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed Sanger Pipeline and Lift Station project area in Denton County, Texas. No cultural
resources were found in the project area. Based on the results of the survey, ARC concludes that
further cultural resource investigations for this project are unwarranted, and recommends that the
THC concur with this assessment. However, if buried cultural materials are discovered during
construction, the Archeology Division of the THC should be notified.
