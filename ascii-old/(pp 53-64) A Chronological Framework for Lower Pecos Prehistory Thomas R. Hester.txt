A Chronological Framework
for Lower Pecos Prehistory
Thomas R. Hester
ABSTRACT
This very brief review of the culture history of the Lower Pecos Region of
Texas identifies and describes major trends and patterns during 11,000 years of
prehistory. The paper provides a chronological perspective for the papers on
the Lower Pecos in this issue of the Texas Archeology Society Bulletin.

INTRODUCTION

The Lower Pecos archeological region is one of the few areas in Texas for
which there is a detailed chronological record. The preservation of organic
materials suitable for radiocarbon analysis, coupled with the excellent stratigraphy in open site and rockshelter deposits, provides a remarkably precise culture
history of the ancient hunter-gatherers of this area.
This paper is a brief review of the chronological framework of the Lower
Pecos Region; it places into temporal perspective some of the major sites,
artifact types, rock art, and other cultural patterns and phenomena. It was
designed originally as a working paper to provide background material for a
1984 Witte Museum planning session on the Lower Pecos. Here, it serves as an
overview of Lower Pecos archeology. Several chronological schemes have been
published for the Lower Pecos (for one of the first, see Johnson 1964), and an
effort has been made here (Table 1) to correlate some of the most recent ones.
THE PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD

The earliest indications of possible human occupation in the Lower Pecos
come from two sites, Bonfire shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Bement 1986)
and Cueva Quebrada rockshelter (41VV162A; Collins 1976, Lundelius 1984).
At the base of the Bonfire deposits, Bone Bed 1 has a variety of Pleistocene
fauna, including mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. No definite evidence of
human association has been found, but recent excavations by Bement (1986)
have shed new light on this early deposit. Some of the faunal remains were
fractured, and among the materials were several large stones that may have been
carried in by humans.
The Cueva Quebrada site (41VV162A) is a small rockshelter about 4 km up
the Rio Grande from the mouth of the Pecos River. Excavations of Zone I at the
site exposed broken and charred animal bones, flakes, a uniface, and a late
Pleistocene antelope bone with cut marks (Collins 1976). The materials have not
been published fully, except for the faunal remains (see Lundelius 1984), and

the radiocarbon assays of 11,970 to 12,350 B.C., which imply a pre-Clovis age,
have not been evaluated in terms of a late Pleistocene human occupation of the
shelter. In an overlying stratum, Zone II, were additional burned and broken
bones, 10 chert flakes, and a Clear Fork tool--a gougelike form (M. B. Collins,
personal communication). A radiocarbon determination of 10,330 B.C. was
obtained, but, again, a full review of this date, and the possibly associated
artifacts from Zone II, has yet to be published.
No occupation or kill sites of the Clovis complex have been found in the
Lower Pecos Region, but it is possible that Bone Bed I at Bonfire, upon further
examination, might be linked to this cultural pattern. Some scattered surface
finds of Clovis-like points have been made in the Val Verde County area
(Greer 1968).
The Folsom complex is documented in Bone Bed 2 (Figure 1, a) at Bonfire
shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Indeed, the bone bed in which was a classic
Folsom point (Figure 1, a) represents a bison drive involving perhaps as many as
27 animals (though some of these may be from a later drive in Plainview times).
Radiocarbon dates indicate that the Folsom activity took place around or before
8200 B.C. (Dibble 1970). Another Folsom point from Val Verde County (Figure
1, b) has been described by Bement and Turpin (1988).
Later Paleo-Indian complexes are more numerous in the Lower Pecos.
Referring again to the research published for Bonfire shelter, we read of a
Plainview complex bison kill, dated at about. 8200 to 8000 B.C. (Figure 1, c is a
point from this kill). At the Devils Mouth site, at the confluence of the Devils
River and the Rio Grande, Late Paleo-Indian points were found in gravel bar
deposits in Area C (Johnson 1964). These include distinctive specimens such as
Plainview and Angostura as well as a type originally defined as the Golondrina
"variant of Plainview" (Figure 1, e). Projectile points now called Early Stemmed
(Figure 1, d) also were found associated with these lanceolate forms.
Subsequent excavations at Devils Mouth by Sorrow (1968) provided more
information on the Late Paleo-Indian era, especially on the dating of what is now
called the Golondrina type (Figure 1, e), which was dated at 6820 B.C. on the
basis of a single radiocarbon assay. At about the same time, James H. Word’s
excavations at Baker Cave, on a tributary of the Devils River, exposed stratigraphically secure deposits that had Golondrina points associated with faunal and
floral remains. He obtained two radiocarbon assays of about 7000 B.C. for the
Golondrina zone (Word and Douglas 1970). Later excavations in 1976 at Baker
Cave by Hester and Heizer, led to the recovery of more Golondrina data (Chadderdon 1983). Hester (1983) has defined the Golondrina complex, which was
represented at Baker Cave by Golondrina points, a bifacial Clear Fork tool, other
lithic implements, and a hearth that yielded abundant floral and faunal remains--all deposited when the climate was somewhat more moist than today
and when there was a notable absence of modern-day xeric plants such as sotol
and lechuguilla. Two more radiocarbon dates of about 7000 B.C. have been
obtained from the Golondrina occupation.

Other early radiocarbon assays in the 6000 to 7000 B.C. range have come
from sites such as Coontail Spin and Eagle Cave (Ross 1965, Story 1966) and
from Arenosa shelter. However, the contexts of these dates and the associations
of artifacts remain unclear, particularly in the case of Arenosa (e.g., Patton and
Dibble 1982). At Hinds Cave, excavated by Shafer and Bryant (1977), more
early radiocarbon dates have been recorded, and a Golondrina occupation (and
possibly earlier material) is reported. Important to the culture history of the
Lower Pecos is establishment of the antiquity of the basketry and other perishable materials found in the earliest occupations. These have been studied by
Andrews and Adovasio (1980) and integrated into broad patterns of early textile
manufacture in northern Mexico and the western United States.
Perhaps indicative of the terminal Paleo-Indian era in the Lower Pecos is
the Angostura point (cf. Johnson 1964, Story 1966). An Angostura point was
found in association with a hearth during the 1984 excavations conducted at
Baker Cave by the author, James H. Word, and Kenneth M. Brown, and as yet
unpublished. The hearth was at the base of a stratified series of cooking pits
associated with Middle and Early Archaic occupations. A charcoal sample
collected by Brown from the hearth that had the associated Angostura point was
dated by radiocarbon assay at 6510+80 B.P. (Beta-14733), which can be calibrated within a range of 5705 to 5205 B.C. (Klein et al. 1982:126).
THE ARCHAIC PERIOD
Early Archaic

This era encompasses Early Holocene occupations from about 6000 B.C.
(or earlier) to around 3500 B.C. (or somewhat later). It is distinguished, in terms
of diagnostic point types, by Baker and Bandy points, "Early Barbed" (many
resembling the Bell type), Gower, and Early Triangular ~igure 1, f-h). All of
these have what the author perceives to be contemporary counterparts in Central
and southern Texas, and they apparently reflect a broad Early Archaic cultural
pattern---once called the Pre-Archaic (Hester 1983)--that did not become associated with a particular region until Middle Archaic times. Radiocarbon dates
are fairly numerous, but, as indicated above, there is some fluctuation in what
are considered the beginning and ending dates for the period. Examples of
radiocarbon dates include Baker Cave (6010 to 3000 B.C., Chadderton 1983),
Eagle Cave (6810 to 2930 B.C., Ross 1965, Story 1966), and Bonfire shelter
(5510 B.C., Ross 1965, Story 1966). Xeric plants such as sotol and lechuguilla
appear at Baker Cave at about 6000 B.C., and, at Hinds Cave to the west on the
Pecos River drainage, even earlier.
Coprolite studies at Hinds Cave have shed considerable light on the diet of
the Early Archaic people (Shafer 1986:74). Little is known about burial patterns,
but Turpin (1985) has reported the use during the Early Archaic of a sinkhole in
Seminole Canyon for multiple interments that had an "early corner notched"
point (cf. Baker) associated. Bement, in the same volume (Turpin 1985:41-43),

provides a detailed review of Early Archaic deposits with associated radiocarbon assays in the Lower Pecos.
Middle Archaic Period

The early phase of the Middle Archaic is distinguished by the first regional
Lower Pecos cultural pattern, noted in the archeological record by a distinctive
index marker, the Pandale projectile point type (Figure 2, a). Radiocarbon dates,
many of which fall between 2700 and 2100 B.C., are available for the Pandalerelated materials from several sites (Baker Cave, Eagle Cave, Fate Bell, and
Arenosa). Items of material culture such as basketry, matting, dart shafts, cordage, and netting are particularly well preserved. At Baker Cave, a large refuse pit
containing worn-out sandals, discarded Pandale points, and other debris was
partially excavated (Chadderdon 1983). In the early phase there is also a wide
range of chipped and ground stone artifacts. Painted pebbles appear at this time,
if not somewhat earlier (Shafer 1986).
The late phase of the Middle Archaic is perhaps the most distinctive and
dominant occupational period in the Lower Pecos in terms of the sheer amount
of cultural refuse. Characterized by contracting-stem Langtry points (Figure 2,
b), and Val Verde points (Figure 2, c), which appear to postdate Langtry points,
the late Middle Archaic has been dated by radiocarbon determinations between
2100 and 1100 B.C. The Langtry type appears to change in stem form through
time at some sites, e.g. at Baker Cave (Word and Douglas 1970, James H. Word,
personal communication). Other point styles include Almagre .(probably unfinished Langtrys or Langtry preforms) and Arledge.
Almost all rockshelters have deposits of the Middle Archaic’s late phase;
radiocarbon assays have been made on materials from Fate Bell and Arenosa
shelters, and Eagle and Centipede caves, among others (Story 1966, also Epstein
1963). There is an abundance of fiber, wood, bone, shell, and leather artifacts,
and a wide range of lithics--projectile points and preforms, thin bifaces used as
knives, unifacial scrapers, burins, and artifacts of ground stone. Painted pebbles
also are found, and it is likely that much of the Pecos River Style polychrome art
was executed during this phase of the Middle Archaic (Shafer 1986, Bement
1988).
Other types of sites also are commonly found in addition to rockshelters;
open occupation sites on terraces were heavily used. Burned rock midden sites,
which represent specialized plant processing areas, probably reflect a technology that was prevalent in Central Texas at the same time.
Late Archaic Period
The Middle Archaic appears to have been uniquely regional in character,
whereas the Late Archaic reflects influences from Central Texas and from areas
to the north. For example, during this period, bison--absent since the late PaleoIndian period---once again were in the Lower Pecos region in some numbers,

and a bison drive and kill has been recorded in Bone Bed 3 at Bonfire shelter
(Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Associated with the bison bones were large, broadbladed Castroville and Montell dart points. Projectile point styles of this era that
are distinctive of the Lower Pecos are the Shumla type (Figure 2, d) and Conejo
type (Figure 2, e). In general, the Late Archaic is dated between 1000 B.C. and
the beginning of the Christian era (but see Turpin 1982:25 for a slightly different
view). Dates of 360 to 800/860 B.C. come from the bison kill at Bonfire; other
radiocarbon dates come from Coontail Spin and Fate Bell shelter (Story 1966).
Perishable materials, chipped and ground stone artifacts, and other items of
material culture characteristic of the Middle Archaic persist, albeit sometimes in
different form, into this period. Turpin (1982:195, 198) indicates that the Red
Linear Style of rock art was introduced into the Lower Pecos at about this time,
noting that hunting motifs, perhaps related to the movement of bison hunters
into the area (e.g., into Bonfire shelter, Bone Bed 3), are its central theme.
Transitional Archaic Period
This period is sometimes combined with the Late Archaic (see Table 1).
However, it is identified by distinctly different index marker projectile points,
such as Ensor, Frio, Paisano (Figure 2, f), and Figueroa (Figure 2, g) and can be
dated to the period between the first or second century of the Christian era and
about A.D. 1000 or somewhat later. Transitional Archaic deposits are widespread in rockshelters and open terrace sites in the Lower Pecos. Indeed, there
may have been an intensified use of open sites at this time. The distinctive ringor crescent-shaped burned rock middens (see Shafer 1986), which presumably
were related to the roasting of bulbs of desert plants, are found in the uplands
during the Transitional Archaic. Painted pebbles, found in the rockshelter refuse, and, perhaps, the Red Linear Style rock art, continue.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD

From around A.D. 1000 to 1600 there is a notable difference in certain
aspects of Lower Pecos archeology. There seems to have been a reduction in
occupation (even of population?), or perhaps there was a shift away from
intensive use of rockshelters to a more mobile life style that led to frequent use
of open terrace and upland sites. Change in material culture is most notable in
the introduction of the bow and arrow. Arrowpoint types include Perdiz, Scallorn, Livermore, and Toyah (Figure 2, h), as well as several minor styles and
arrowpoint preforms. Sherds of plain, bone-tempered ceramics are found at a
handful of sites, but never in large numbers. Other traits include distinctive end
scrapers (Bement and Turpin 1987), brownware sherds (Turpin 1982), and
beveled knives (Greer 1968).
Depictions of the bow and arrow in the Red Monochrome rock art style
clearly date that style to the Late Prehistoric. Although it is probably safe to say
that an "Archaic" style hunting and gathering lifeway persisted from earlier

times, it is possible that the age-old traditions of the Lower Pecos region were
disrupted in the Late Prehistoric, perhaps by new groups moving into the region.
The shifts in settlement pattern (which, owing to the bias for excavation of
¯ rockshelters, we know little about), the appearance of new types of sites such as
Infierno (41VV446), with its stone tipi rings (Turpin 1982), and the introduction
of a new rock art style, might together indicate disruption of the indigenous
groups by intrusive peoples. The Late Prehistoric materials often form, quite
literally, a thin veneer over the long-lived Archaic. Much more research is
needed in practically every facet of study involving this period.
HISTORIC PERIOD
Equally little is known about the succeeding Historic period, when Apache
and, later, other Indian groups from various regions moved into the Lower
Pecos. Fielder Canyon Cave reported by Kirkland in 1942 (Kirkland 1942)
remains one of the few Historic Indian occupation sites that have been reported.
In addition to a few scattered metal arrowpoints, these groups left behind only
their distinctive rock art depicting Spaniards, guns, missions, and priests (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967, Turpin 1989). A recent paper of Turpin’s (1987) presents a
detailed review of the ethnohistoric problems surrounding the study of the
Historic Indians of the Lower Pecos region.
