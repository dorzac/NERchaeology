ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed Coline Number 4 well location site
(2.2 acres) and access road (900 feet) was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates on November 10, 1996. This project was conducted for Jet Oil Producers,
Inc. of Coldspring, Texas. The project area is located in the Sam Houston National
Forest, south-central San Jacinto County, Texas. This investigation was performed
using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing and probing. No
prehistoric or historic sites were found. It is recommended that construction of the well
pad and access road be allowed to proceed, as planned, and monitoring during
construction by an archaeologist is not considered necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Jet Oil Producers, Inc. of Coldspring, Texas plans to construct a well pad and
access road in the Sam Houston National Forest, south-central San Jacinto County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project area is located in the 2556 acre Foster Minerals lease
that is part of the James Rankin survey (Abstract 40) and is depicted on the 7.5'
U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Coldspring, dated 1960 and photorevised in 1976
(Figure 2). The U.T.M. coordinates for the approximate center of the well pad are
Northing 33 78 950 and Easting 2 89 850.
The size of the well pad is 2.2 acres, and the length of the access road is
approximately 900 feet. The road connects the proposed Coline Number 4 well with Jet
Oil Producers, Inc. existing Coline Number 3 Well (Figure 3).
This area is the property of the United States Forest Service, United States
Department of Agriculture and is administrated through the New Waverly District office
(Region 8). Wally Kingsborough is the District Archaeologist, and John E. Ippolito
(Forest Heritage Program Manager), is the Forest Service archaeologist for each of the
four National Forests in Texas.
The project area is surrounded by several drainages. These include Spring
Branch, approximately 1200 meters due west of the center of the well pad site; the East
Fork of the San Jacinto River (the major drainage in the area), approximately 3400
meters due east of the center of the well pad site; and Miller Creek (a major tributary of
the San Jacinto River), approximately 2500 meters due north of the center of the well
pad site. The closest stream, according to the topographic map, is an unnamed
intermittent tributary of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River approximately 50 meters
due east of the center of the well pad site. The topographic position of the project area
is the eastern slope of a sandy ridge overlooking this tributary.
Overall, the project area is situated within an area containing numerous dry
stream channels and sandy ridges. Previous archaeological surveys in the vicinity of
the current project area have identified both prehistoric and historic sites and the county
contains several significant archaeological sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey
was required by the State Historic Preservation Officer (S.H.P.O.), the lead review and
compliance agency, before construction of the well pad and access road is allowed to
proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, Jet Oil Producers, Inc. contracted with
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) to perform this service. The project
number assigned by Brazos Valley Research Associates is BVRA 96-10. No permit
from the Texas Antiquities Committee was required for this project. The project area is
part of the Coline Oil Field. Overall, this area has been the locus of intensive oil and
gas exploration as indicated by oil and gas wells, pipelines, and access roads on the
topographic quadrangle. The project area is situated in the south-central portion of San
Jacinto County, south of the small community of Evergreen. The main highway in the
area is F.M. 945 which runs north-south and, at one point, is approximately 950 meters
due east of the center of the proposed well pad location.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coast Plain physiographic
province and the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The
overstory vegetation in the project area is primarily large pines and hardwoods, while
the understory consists of various shrubs and forbs. A more detailed discussion of the
environmental setting for the Sam Houston National Forest is presented in Ippolito's
(1983) thorough overview of Texas National Forests. The surface geology is the Willis
Formation which consists of various sands and clays containing some small gravels.
The reader is referred to Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et
al. (1932) for a more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. In terms of its
topographic setting, the well pad and access road are on the slope of a sandy upland
ridge overlooking an unnamed tributary of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River.
Soils
The project area is depicted in the soils book for San Jacinto County (McEwen et
al. 1988) on Sheet Number 75. The entire project area is within Pinetucky fine sandy
loam (PfB), 1 to 5 percent slopes. Pinetucky fine sandy loam is a gently sloping soil
found on broad, smooth, upland plains (McEwen et al. 1988:37-38). This soil typically
has a fine sandy loam surface layer about 12 inches thick and a subsoil of yellowishbrown sandy clay loam about 28 inches deep. Below this is a yellowish-brown sandy
clay loam with a depth of 56 inches. This soil is moderately well drained and runoff is
slow to medium. Seasonal wetness and moderately slow permeability are seen as
major limitations to modern use including recreation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Previous Investigations
San Jacinto County is located in the Southeast Texas region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical
Overview published by the Office of the State Archeologist, Texas Historical
Commission. This is an area that was well documented in terms of numbers of sites in
1985 when compared to other regions of Texas. When the statistical overview was
compiled, a total of 1630 prehistoric sites (8.06% of the state) was recorded in the entire
region. Only four of the thirteen regions in Texas reported more sites or had a higher
percentage statewide. Only two counties, Chambers (240) and Harris (300), had more
recorded sites in 1985 (Biesaart et al. 1985:88). The 132 sites recorded in San Jacinto
County in 1985 consisted of 8.10% of the region and .65% of the state. The reader is
referred to the overview for additional statistical information concerning San Jacinto
County and its relation to the rest of Texas.
Although numerous archaeological investigations have been conducted in San
Jacinto County, the vast majority has been small area surveys, often resulting in
negative findings. Many of these investigations resulted from the demand placed on the
landscape by the oil and gas industry. A bibliography of the Southeastern Region of
Texas by William E. Moore (1989) contains a listing of all work done in San Jacinto
County through 1989. In addition, an ongoing project sponsored by the Department of
Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission is engaged in abstracting contract
reports by year. To date, volumes have been published for 1987 (Moore 1991), 1988
(Moore 1990a), 1989 (Moore 1993a), 1990 (Moore 1992a), 1991 (Moore 1992b), and
1992 (Moore 1994a).
Two overviews of the archaeology of the National Forests of Texas have been
published. In 1979, Ross C. Fields (1979) prepared a report that discussed the cultural
resources of each forest. This was followed by Ippolito's (1983) more extensive work.
Ippolito's effort provides a comprehensive discussion of the archaeology of all four
forests and is the most recent and thorough review of the archaeology of the Texas
national forests available.
The first major archaeological investigation to be conducted in San Jacinto
County was survey and testing in the Livingston Reservoir. The initial survey was
conducted in 1963 by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) and recorded
sites within and adjacent to the proposed lake. Most of the sites located were found to
occur towards the southeastern end of the lake. The results of the survey have been
reported by Nunley (1963).

6

Two of the sites found during the Lake Livingston survey in San Jacinto County
were tested in 1965. These were the Trichel site (41SJ16) excavated by TASP
personnel and the Houston site (41SJ19) excavated by members of the Houston
Archeological Society. Both sites have been classified as Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric in age based on the presence of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics.
The only other prehistoric site to be excavated in San Jacinto County is the
Strawberry Hill site (41SJ160). This site was investigated by the Texas Highway
Department in 1974 (Keller and Weir 1979). Strawberry Hill yielded a large quantity of
artifacts but, according to the authors, produced little new information. It is described as
a multi-component site containing both Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials.
A historic Indian site in San Jacinto County dating to the mid-nineteenth century
was excavated by Dick Ping Hsu (1969) through the combined efforts of the Houston
Archeological Society, science students of Coldspring High School, the Texas Building
Commission, and the Texas Water Development Board. Glass trade beads and silver
brooches had never been reported from this section of Texas, and the presence of
burials and other historic and native manufactured artifacts make this a very significant
site. It is hypothesized by Hsu (1969:47) that the "Alabama-Coushatta was probably the
group that buried their dead in this location."
It is beyond the scope of this negative findings report to discuss every
archaeological investigation in the Sam Houston National Forest. Several recent
efforts, however, are worthy of mention. These include three surveys of well pad sites
in the Mercy Oil Field in 1992 by James E. Corbin (1992) and Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 1993b, 1994b) and three surveys of well pad sites in the Coldspring
Oil Field by James E. Corbin (1994) and Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore
and Bradle 1996a, 1996b). The 1993 study by Brazos Valley Research Associates
recorded prehistoric site 41SJ48, and the 1994 study by Corbin recorded prehistoric site
41SJ49. The 1996 surveys by Brazos Valley Research Associates were negative in
terms of locating prehistoric and/or historic sites. In 1994, the Coline #3 well that is
adjacent to the proposed well pad discussed in this report was investigated by
archaeologists from the New Waverly District and no sites were found (John E. Ippolito,
personal communication, November 14, 1996).
Most recently, three major works have appeared which contain detailed
overviews relevant to Southeast Texas and the project area. These are Archeology in
the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document by the Department of
Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Roger G. Moore's (1995) Ph.D.
dissertation entitled The Mossy Grove Model of Long-Term Forager-Collector
Adaptations in Inland Southeast Texas, and Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. The latter reviews the current state of Archeology in Texas and
contains a chapter devoted to Southeast Texas (Patterson 1995).

Cultural Chronology
The cultural chronology of this part of Texas is, according to Story (1981), by no
means completely understood. Other researchers such as Aten (1983), Bement et al.
(1987), Bond and Moore (1980), Ippolito (1983), Keller and Weir (1979), Moore (1978,
1990b), Patterson (1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1983, 1986, 1989), Shafer and Stearns
(1975), Shafer et al. (1975), Story (1974, 1981), Story et al. (1990), and Wheat and
Gregg (1988) have discussed the chronology of Southeast Texas and the Texas
National Forests in more detail and the reader is advised to consult these sources for
additional information.

FIELD METHODS
The project was divided into three phases - background and archival research,
field survey, and report preparation. The background and archival research consisted
of a check of the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
The Principal Investigator performed this task.
Background and Archival Research
A check of the site records at TARL was conducted to identify any previously
recorded sites, if any, in the project area. In order to better understand the nature of
previous archaeological work in the region, the archival research included a review of
the following documents: a statistical overview of Texas archaeology prepared by the
Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985), an overview of the National Forests
in Texas by Forest Service Archeologist, John E. Ippolito (1983) a bibliography of
Southeast Texas (Moore 1989), several contract reports documenting work in the Sam
Houston National Forest (Moore 1993b, 1994b), and a series of reports containing
abstracts for Texas contract archaeology (Moore 1990a, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1993a,
1994a). In addition, John Ippolito was asked about possible sites in the project area
that might not be in the site files at TARL.
Field Investigation
The field investigation was conducted on November 10, 1996. Michael R. Bradle
was the Project Archaeologist. He supervised the fieldwork with assistance from Dwight
R. Cropper. A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire project area.
Shovel tests were excavated at the well pad and along the access road. In all, 14
shovel tests were dug. Excavated matrix was screened through 1/4 inch hardware
cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I) and in the field
notes. Tests were dug until clay was encountered. Depths of the tests varied from 34
to 68 centimeters below the ground surface, and the average depth was calculated at
49.71 centimeters. In addition to the shovel testing, all exposed areas in the project
area were inspected for cultural materials, and 22 shovel probes were excavated; all
were negative. No artifacts were collected during the course of this investigation.
Report Preparation
The Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist performed this task inhouse.
A draft report prepared for review by the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas
Historical Commission; the United States Forest Service; and Jet Oil Producers, Inc. A
copy of the report, all notes, shovel test forms, and other records are on file at Brazos
Valley Research Associates.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey did not locate any prehistoric or historic sites within the project area.
Much of the area examined had been previously disturbed through logging, oil and gas
well pads, and access road construction. Although portions of the project area appears,
based on the topographic map, to be likely settings for prehistoric sites, the lack of such
sites could be, in part, due to the shallow, moderately well drained soils with slow to
medium runoff (see Environmental Setting above). The archival research conducted for
this and other projects in the Sam Houston National Forest indicates that prehistoric
sites in the area are typically found on landforms with deep well-drained sandy soils
such as 41SJ48 south of the current project area, located by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 1993b), and 41SJ49 west of the project area on a sandy ridge above
the floodplain of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River located by Corbin (1994). Site
41SJ48 is on a sandy ridge in Splendora very fine sandy loam (SpA) as defined by
McEwen et al. 1988:11), and site 41SJ49 is believed by Corbin to be in Doucette loamy
fine sand (DoB). Both site areas contained sandy loam to depths of at least 90
centimeters.
An apparent lack of a permanent water source in part of the project area is
viewed as a major reason for the absence of sites in the area surveyed. The
combination of an absence of natural springs in the area, as stated by Mr. Hughart, and
the fact that much of this area is drained by intermittent streams that contain only
seasonal flow should be considered. It should also be noted that much of the area
examined was in topographical settings not typically utilized by prehistoric groups and
that, should sites exist, the chance of in situ deposits is low given the amount of
previous disturbance.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant cultural resources were found during the archaeological survey
documented in this report. It is, therefore, recommended that Jet Oil Producers, Inc. be
allowed to proceed with construction of the Coline Number 4 well pad and access road
as planned. The presence of an archaeologist to act as monitor during the construction
phase is not considered necessary. There is always the possibility that cultural
materials or features are missed during the course of any archaeological survey.
Should the presence of cultural materials not discussed in this report be discovered
during construction, the client is advised to cease work and contact the State Historic
Preservation Officer immediately. In addition, the Forest Service archaeologist should
be advised of the situation.
