Type of Investigation: Intensive pedestrian survey
Regulatory Trigger: Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
Principal Investigator: Laura I. Acuña
Crew Members: Laura I. Acuña and Justin Rains
Date(s) of Work: April 18–20, 2017
Person-Days: 2 people, 3 days
Area Surveyed: The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is 37.72 acres and includes 20.2 acres of
proposed construction impacts (9.6 acres for the well pad and 10.6 acres for the access
road/pipeline corridor) and 17.52 acres of BLM cultural buffer zone.
Newly Recorded Sites: Isolated Find IF01
Revisited Sites: 41LK139
Curation: Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
Comments: Isolated Find IF01 consisted of a prehistoric tested cobble of unknown age within a
shovel test at 0 to 10 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The area surrounding the isolate did
not contain any evidence of cultural activity areas, features, or diagnostic artifacts. Isolated find
IF01 is as an Isolated Manifestation under BLM survey standards and no further work is
recommended.
Site 41LK139 is a prehistoric lithic scatter with burned rock fragments, debitage flakes, and lithic
tools dating to an Archaic occupation. Atkins evaluated the site under Criteria A and D for listing
in the NRHP. The site represents a procurement area with possible limited processing activities
typical of the region. A dart point fragment suggests a general Archaic occupation, possibly
Early Archaic. Although the site represents a procurement area, it lacks distinct cultural activity
areas, features, or buried deposits within the proposed project’s APE that would provide
additional evidence on settlement patterns for the region. The site has been negatively impacted

Abstract

Abstract
On behalf of Statoil North America (Statoil) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Atkins
North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted cultural resources investigations that included an intensive
pedestrian survey for the proposed USA 21 Well Pad Site in Live Oak County, Texas. Statoil
proposes to construct a well pad site approximately 9.6 acres in size that includes a clearing limit,
and will improve an existing 1.97 kilometer (km; 1.23 mile) long two-track road for access. The
proposed work also includes a pipeline corridor approximately 0.88 km (0.55 mile) in length
adjacent to the two-track road. The project is located approximately 9.48 km (5.89 miles) north of
Three Rivers, Texas, and is adjacent to the Choke Canyon State Park North Shore Unit boundary.
Although the project is located on privately owned land, the BLM owns part of the mineral estate
within the project area. In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) owns approximately 0.88
km (0.55 mile) of the proposed access road, of which 0.12 km (0.08 mile) is managed by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). Thus, the work was conducted in compliance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, and its
implementing regulations under the Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,
as amended in 2004 (Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800 [36 CFR 800]). The following
is a small-scale report detailing the results of a background review and Class III (BLM
Classification) intensive pedestrian survey. The investigations were completed between April 1821, 2017. Laura I. Acuña served as Principal Investigator during the survey investigations,
assisted by Justin Rains. Krista McClanahan completed the background review.
In total, the Area of Potential Effects (APE) of the project area is 39.72 acres. The investigations
consisted of a Class III intensive pedestrian survey within the 39.72-acre APE, which includes the
proposed 22.20 acres of construction impacts and 17.52 acres of BLM cultural buffer zone. The
proposed construction impacts are 9.6 acres for the well pad and 12.6 acres for the access road
and pipeline corridor, for a total of 22.20 acres, with 0.9 m (3 ft) in depth as the maximum depth
of surface impacts. The maximum depth of the well will be approximately 30 m (100 ft) in depth.
The background review determined that the entire APE was previously surveyed for cultural
resources. The pedestrian survey revealed that the APE has been severely disturbed by frequent
land clearing activities associated with the maintenance of the two-track road. The ground visibility
ranged from 20 percent to 60 percent, and 45 shovel tests were excavated within the Survey
Area. During the investigations, site 41LK139 was relocated and expanded within the Survey Area
and one isolated find (IF01) was recorded.
Site 41LK139 is a previously recorded prehistoric lithic scatter with tested cobbles, burned rock
fragments, debitage flakes, and lithic tools dating to an Archaic occupation. The site was
previously recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP. Atkins evaluated the site under
Criteria A and D for listing on the NRHP. The site represents a procurement area with possible
limited processing activities typical of the region. The site extended to encompass a large lithic
landscape of tested cobbles and cores previously recorded as low-density artifact scatters in
1981. A dart point fragment suggests a general Archaic occupation, possibly Early Archaic.
Although the site represents a procurement area, the site lacks distinct cultural activity areas,
features, or buried deposits within the APE that would provide additional evidence on settlement

patterns for the region. The site has been negatively impacted by land-clearing activities
associated with ranching, hunting, two-track road development, and oil and gas. The site will be
impacted by the proposed access road and pipeline corridor. However, the portion of the site
within the APE is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP. Based on the findings,
Atkins recommends no further work for the portion of the site within the APE.
Isolated Find IF01 consisted of a prehistoric tested cobble of unknown age within a shovel test at
0 to 20 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The isolate did not contain any evidence of cultural
activity areas, features, or diagnostic artifacts. Isolated find IF01 is as an Isolated Manifestation
under BLM survey standards and no further work is recommended.
Based on the investigations, no newly recorded historic properties were identified within the
project APE that meet the eligibility criteria for listing in the NRHP under 36 CFR 60.04. Atkins
recommends no further work and a finding of no historic properties affected for the undertaking.
No artifacts were collected during the investigations and records will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

I. Introduction

I. Introduction
On behalf of Statoil North America (Statoil) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Atkins
North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted cultural resources investigations that included an intensive
pedestrian survey for the proposed USA 21 Well Pad Site in Live Oak County, Texas (Figure 1).
Statoil proposes to construct a well pad site approximately 9.6 acres in size that includes clearing
limit, and improve an existing 1.97 kilometer (km; 1.23 mile [mi]) two-track road for access. The
proposed work also includes a pipeline corridor approximately 0.88 km (0.55 mi) in length
adjacent to the two-track road. The project is located approximately 9.48 km (5.89 mi) north of
Three Rivers, Texas, and adjacent to the Choke Canyon State Park North Shore Unit boundary.
The following is a small-scale report detailing the results of the intensive pedestrian survey.
The project is within private property with the BLM owning part of the mineral estate within the
project area. In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) owns approximately 0.88 km (0.55
mi) of the proposed access road, of which 0.12 km (0.08 mi) is managed by Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (TPWD). The federal ownership necessitates compliance with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, and its implementing
regulations under the Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation as amended
in 2004 (Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800 [36 CFR 800]). The investigations were
completed between April 18-21, 2017. Laura I. Acuña served as Principal Investigator during the
survey investigations, assisted by Justin Rains. Krista McClanahan completed the background
review. Field efforts were completed in compliance with guidelines and standards set forth under
36 CFR 800.4 and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines, as amended (48
Federal Regulations § 44716), the BLM procedures for performing cultural resources field work,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists.

Project Description
The proposed project will consist of the installation of a well pad site within private property. The
well pad site, including clearance areas, will be approximately 9.6 acres (ac) in size. The depth of
impacts will be approximately 0.6 meter (m; 2 ft) for the clearing and grading of the ground surface
and more than 30 m (100 ft) in depth for the well. The proposed access road is approximately
1.97 km (1.23 mi) in length and the width of impacts for the road will be approximately 9 m (30 ft)
to 15 m (50 ft) wide to account for the 7.3 m (24 ft) wide roadway and temporary construction
easements, for a total of 5.4 ac of impacts. The depth of impacts for the road will be approximately
0.3 m (1 ft) to account for the grading of topsoil to up fill with gravel. The proposed pipeline is
approximately 0.88 km (0.55 mi) in length and width of the proposed impacts for the pipeline
centerline and corridor is 24 m (80 ft) in width, for a total of 7.2 acres of impacts. The depth of
impacts for the pipeline will be approximately 0.9 m (3 ft) for the installation of the pipeline. The
pipeline corridor includes approximately 1.73 ac of the access road corridor. The pipeline will
terminate just north of the proposed project area and connect with an existing pipeline corridor.

I. Introduction

In total, the Area of Potential Effects (APE) of the project area is 39.72 acres and includes the
proposed construction impacts and BLM cultural buffer zones. The proposed construction impacts
are 9.6 ac for the well pad and 12.6 ac for the access road and pipeline corridor, for a total of
22.20 ac, with 0.9 m (3 ft) in depth as the maximum depth of surface impacts (Figure 2). The BLM
cultural buffer zones are 17.52 acres in size. The maximum depth of the well will be approximately
30 m (100 ft) in depth. An APE for indirect effects is not included in this effort. A preliminary
background review of the project area determined there are no listed National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP)-listed historic resources within a 1.6 km (1 mi) radius of the project area that could
be visually impacted by the undertaking.

Project Location
The project is located on the Willow Hollow Tank 7.5-minute USGS quadrangle approximately
9.48 km (5.89 mi) north of Three Rivers, Texas, and adjacent to the Choke Canyon State Park
North Shore Unit boundary. The well pad site, the proposed pipeline, and approximately 1.09 km
(0.68 mi) of the access road is within private property, specifically within Statoil property. The well
pad site is within the southeastern corner of the parcel with the southern and eastern boundaries
abutting the property fence line. The access road runs parallel to the eastern boundary of the
parcel and an existing two-track road for 0.67 km (0.42 mi), and along the northern boundary of
the tract for approximately 0.42 km (0.26 mi). Approximately 0.88 km (0.55 mi) of the access road
is owned by the BOR and approximately 0.12 km (0.08 mi) is managed by TPWD.

II. Environmental Setting

II. Environmental Setting
General Setting
The project area is located within an upland setting dissected by unnamed drainages with an
altitude range of 230 to 290 ft above mean sea level (amsl). From the well pad site at
approximately 260 ft amsl, the terrain gradually slopes to the highest point of the project within
the proposed roadway, approximately 287 ft amsl, oriented in a northeasterly direction. From the
northeastern corner of the roadway headed west, the project moderately slopes down to unnamed
drainages that are at 270 ft amsl and 230 ft amsl.
The surrounding area of the APE consists of undeveloped parcels of rangeland intersected by
numerous pipeline corridors, two-track roads, and well pads. A gravel pit and private air strip is
north of the project area. The man-made Raschke Lake is located adjacent to the project and the
Statoil property is utilized as a seasonal deer lease and hunting camp. The western portion of the
proposed roadway consists of an unimproved two-track road up to the northeastern corner. As
the proposed roadway shifts south, it consists of an improved gravel road that terminates at an
existing well pad that is outside of the APE. The proposed well pad is moderately vegetated and
is intersected by unimproved two-track roads. The upland landform contains extensive chert
gravel and cobble outcroppings on the surface from the western portion of the APE to the east.
The density of the chert gravel outcropping diminishes as the landform gently slopes to the south
toward the well pad site.
The subtropical climate consists of hot, dry summers and mild winters with peak rainfall occurring
in spring and fall (Griffith et al. 2007). The spring rains are a result of weather fronts and fall rains
are tropical in origin. Precipitation is erratic, with extreme year-to-year moisture variation, and
droughts are common (Griffith et al. 2007). Much of the land use around the region consists of
rangeland with minimal cultivation consisting of grain sorghum, small grains, cotton, and
watermelon (Griffith et al. 2007).

Geology and Soils
The APE of the well pad site is mapped as 100 percent Terrace Deposits that consist of sand,
silt, and clay deposits with gravel in higher terrace deposits (USGS 2017a). The roadway APE is
mapped as 44 percent Uvalde Gravel, 32 percent Frio Clay, and 24 percent Catahoula Formation.
Uvalde Gravel consists of sand, fine-medium quartz with silt in parts, and some caliche modules
(USGS 2017b). Frio Clay consists of clay with gypsum with calcareous concretions (USGS
2017c). Catahoula Formation consists of mudstone, sand, and sandstone (USGS 2017d).
The soils of the project area generally consist of clay or clay loam 0 to 37 inches (in) (0 to 94
centimeters [cm]) followed by 37 to 80 in (94 to 203 cm) of claystone or siltstone bedrock. Table
1 contains the soil types and location within the APE.

Flora and Fauna
The project is located within the Southern Texas Plains Level III ecological region, and the TexasTamaulipan Thornscrub Level IV ecological region (Griffith et al. 2004; 2007). The region consists
primarily of thorny brush consisting of thornscrub and shrub savannas influenced by continuous
grazing and fire suppression activities. The vegetation is dominated by drought-tolerant, mostly
small-leaved, and often thorn-laden small trees and shrubs, especially legumes. The most
important woody species is honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Where conditions are suitable,
there is a dense understory of smaller trees and shrubs such as brasil (Condalia hookeri), colima
or lime pricklyash (Zanthoxylum fagara), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), lotebush
(Ziziphus obtusifolia), granjeno (Celtis pallida), kidneywood (Eysenhardtia texana), coyotillo
(Karwinskia humboldtiana), Texas paloverde (Parkinsonia texana), anacahuita (Cordia boissieri),
and various species of cacti. Xerophytic brush species, such as blackbrush (Acacia rigidula),
guajillo (Acacia berlandieri), and ceniza (Leucophyllum frutescens), are typical on the rocky,
gravelly ridges and uplands. The brush communities also tend to grade into desert scrub near the
Rio Grande. Mid- and short grasses are common, including cane bluestem (Bothriochloa
barbinodis), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), multiflowered false rhodesgrass (Trichloris
pluriflora), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), pink pappusgrass (Pappophorum bicolor),
bristlegrasses (Setaria spp.), lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.), and tobosa (Hilaria mutica). On
overgrazed sites or drier sites to the west, red grama (Bouteloua trifida), Texas grama (Bouteloua
rigidiseta), buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides), and curleymesquite (Hilaria belangeri) are found
(Griffith et al. 2007).

II. Environmental Setting

Game species are diverse and abundant, supporting the regional ranching income with hunting
leases. They include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), and collared
peccary (Pecari tajacu).

Hydrology and Geomorphology
The project intersects two unnamed ephemeral drainages that drain into Choke Canyon
Reservoir. The western-most drainage has been modified to create Raschke Lake north of the
project area. The eastern-most drainage also has been modified to create a small pond north of
the project area. The project area is within an upland landform or ridge top with little soil deposition
based on previous investigations (Thoms et al. 1981).

III. Cultural Setting

III. Cultural Setting
Regional Cultural Context
The context provides a brief general archeological chronology of South Texas with some
examples of sites from the Choke Canyon Reservoir investigations. Following the chronology
outlined by Hester (2004), South Texas has had evidence of human occupation since the
Paleoindian period.
The Paleoindian period (11,200–8,000 Before Present [B.P.]) in South Texas is primarily
represented by surface manifestations of fluted projectile points such as Clovis and Folsom
(Hester 2004). Other points, including Plainview, Golondrina, Angostura, and Scottsbluff are
represented in the region. There are no recorded mammoth kill sites or butchering sites within
South Texas. However, mammoth remains have been found along South Texas creeks and
waterways (Hester 2004). Excavated campsites with features dating to this period are very limited
in number and all Paleoindian sites within Choke Canyon consist of surface scatters of projectile
points along the terraces of the Frio River and its major tributaries. Most of the sites identified
during the Choke Canyon Reservoir investigations were observed within ancient floodplain
terrace remnants with some within the slopes and upland of valley margins (Hall et al. 1986).
Artifacts from subsequent periods also are represented within these surficial sites. The Loma
Sandia site (41LK28) and site 41LK31/32 contain evidence of Paleoindian projectile points and
are located within 8 km (5 mi) east and 4.8 km (3 mi) south of the project area, respectively.
Generally, the Paleoindian record of South Texas and Choke Canyon represents small-group
mobile societies focused on big-game hunting and supplementing with the exploitation of smallscale resources (Bousman 2004).
The Archaic period (8,000–1,200 B.P.) is divided into Early, Middle, and Late Archaic (Perttula
2004). The lithic technology of the Early Archaic (8,000–4,500 B.P.) consisted of early cornernotched and early-basal notched horizons, and large bifacial Guadalupe tools (Hester 2004).
Early corner-notched points include Martindale, Uvalde, Baker, and Bandy points. The early
basal-notched points consist of Bell and Andice points, as well as large unifacial Clear Fork tools
(Hester 2004). In Choke Canyon Reservoir, evidence of the Early Archaic components are
focused along the low terraces of the Frio River, its tributaries, and relic channels (Hall et al.
1986). The subsistence patterns shifted to small-scale resources as noted in site 41LK31/32, a
stratified site along the second terrace of the Frio River. The site contained evidence of welldefined hearth features, mussel shell, faunal remains of turtles, land snail shells, lithic debris, and
unstemmed biface fragments. The deposits were identified approximately 2 m (6.5 feet) below
the surface, which also contained a Middle Archaic component (Hall et al. 1986).
The Middle Archaic period (4,500–2,400 B.P.) consisted of a more intensified use of earth ovens,
formal hearths, and burned rock middens, indicating the increased use of plant resources (Hall et
al. 1986; Hester 2004). Small mammals, lizards, snakes, turtles, land snails, and fish also
continued to be exploited. The lithic assemblage is dominated by the Tortugas and Abasolo dart
point types, as well as unifacial and bifacial distally bevelled tools (Hester 2004). Most Middle

III. Cultural Setting

Archaic sites within Choke Canyon occur along the floodplain and terraces of major stream
channels. Those sites with large burned rock features are typically along the valley margins or
upper reaches of the floodplain (Hall et al. 1986). Evidence of burial practices in the form of
cemeteries was encountered at the Loma Sandia (41LK28) site, which contained over 200 burials
(Hester 2004). Grave goods included triangular points, gouges, some marine shell, pieces of
sandstone, and tubular sandstone pipes (Hester 2004).
The use of earthen ovens, hearths, and burned rock middens continued throughout the Late
Archaic period (2,400–1,300 B.P.) within Choke Canyon. Grinding implements also have been
found during this time period, indicating an intensification of plant resources requiring processing,
such as mesquite and acacia (Hall et al. 1986). At site 41LK67, an abundance of mussel shell
within a burned rock feature suggests the features also were being used for other resources. As
with the Middle Archaic period, faunal remains of small-game such as rodents, rabbits, turtles,
lizards, snakes, and fish have been encountered within Late Archaic contexts. Sites occur along
stream channels with lithic procurement sites on high terraces and ridges (Hester 2004). Lithic
technology consists of Ensor, Shumla, Marcos, and Montel points, as well as Frio, Ellis, and
Fairland dart points in Choke Canyon. Triangular bevelled tools identified in these contexts were
possibly used for wood working or plant harvesting of available resources (Hall et al. 1986).
During the Late Prehistoric period (1,300–400 B.P.), the large hearth features, earth ovens, and
burned rock middens drop, suggesting a reduced reliance on plant food as the bow-and-arrow
technology spread across the South Texas region (Hall et al. 1986). Along with the small arrow
points of Perdiz and Scallorn, bone-tempered pottery serve as diagnostic artifacts for this time
period. Within the Choke Canyon region, deposits are no deeper than 40 cmbs with settlements
focused on the banks of major river channels, drainages, and natural levees of relic channels
rather than the terraces (Hall et al. 1986). The Toyah horizon, a cultural pattern of the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas, is represented at several sites in South Texas consisting of Perdiz
points, small end scrapers, bevelled knives, Leon Plain (bone-tempered) pottery, shell ornaments,
and ceramic figurines. The Toyah traits encountered within South Texas sites represent either
population movement or likely cultural diffusion of traits (Hester 2004). In Choke Canyon, site
41MC222 contained evidence of bison-butchering and bone-tempered pottery with Scallorn, other
stemmed arrow points, and Ensor points (Hester 2004). The subsistence economy focuses on a
variety of small game, deer, and pronghorn, supplemented by the continued utilization of land
snails, fish, turtles, and freshwater mussels (Hall et al. 1986, Hester 2004). Some pottery is
represented in sites within the Choke Canyon, consisting primarily of bone-tempered utilitarian
ceramics with some evidence of grinding implements being used as well (Hall et al. 1986).
Within the Choke Canyon, limited evidence of the Protohistoric period (400–250 B.P.) is
represented. Sites 41LK31/32 and 41MC296 contained a metal arrow point and a metal knife,
respectively. The metal knife is similar to those found at Spanish-Colonial missions in Texas along
with a lanceolate Guerrero arrow point. However, no Spanish-Colonial diagnostic ceramics have
been found within the Choke Canyon region (Hall et al. 1986).

III. Cultural Setting

Pre-Field Research
Atkins conducted a cultural resources background review of the area within 0.40 km (0.25 mi)radius of the APE utilizing available records and literature at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), J.J. Pickle Research Campus, and the University of Texas at Austin with the
purpose of determining the location of previously recorded archeological sites (sites issued a
trinomial/recorded at TARL). The Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) online Restricted
Archeological Sites Atlas files were also used to identify NRHP-eligible and -listed properties and
sites, NRHP districts, cemeteries (including Historic Texas Cemeteries [HT])), Official Texas
Historical Markers (OTHM) (including Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks [RTHL]), State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), as well as any other potential cultural resources such as National
Historic Landmarks (NHLs), National Monuments, National Memorials, National Historic Sites,
and National Historical Parks to ensure the completeness of the study. As a secondary source of
NRHP-listed properties and NHLs, the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP database and GIS
Spatial Data as well as the NHL Program were consulted. Additionally, Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) database of NRHP-listed and -eligible bridges also was reviewed. Prior
to the commencement of fieldwork, historic aerial photographs and topographic maps (National
Environmental Title Research Online 2017) were examined to review the historic development of
the project area
Based on the records, one previously recorded site (41LK139) is within the project APE (Appendix
A). An additional six previously recorded sites (41LK138, 41LK145, 41LK151, 41LK152, 41LK257,
and 41LK262) were identified within a 0.40 km (0.25 mi)-radius of the project area (Table 2). The
sites were recorded during a series of investigations of the Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1974,
1977, 1979, and 1981, and included the project area (Lynn et al. 1977; Roemer 1981). The
background review determined that the entire project area was re-surveyed in 1981 during one of
several Choke Canyon Reservoir investigations conducted by Texas Tech University under The
University of Texas at San Antonio on behalf of BOR (Thoms et al. 1981). In addition,
approximately 0.88 km (0.55 mi) of the proposed access road was previously surveyed by the
BOR in 1983 (Etchieson 1983).

Site 41LK139 is located within the APE near the northeastern corner of the project area along the
proposed access road. The site was initially recorded as a prehistoric lithic/burned rock scatter
during the survey of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1977 (Thoms et al 1981). The site consisted of
burned chert, quartzite, and sandstone with gastropod scattered across a site area 400 m by 300
m in size (1977 41LK137 Site Form, Atlas 2017). The site is located within a ridge top with chert
cobbles and represented a lithic procurement area with possible remains of hearth features.
Based on the results of the survey and analysis of the sites recorded in the region, site 41LK139
did not warrant additional testing for further investigations. The researchers determined the site
would not yield significant information to contribute to the prehistory of Choke Canyon (Thoms et
al. 1981). These investigations also identified two sparse lithic scatters, LDS4 and LDS5, across
the landform within the APE. The scatters were not designated as sites due to their extents across
the landform with a high concentration of naturally occurring chert cobbles and were designated
as “low-density artifact scatters” consisting of tested cores, cortex flakes, and very sparse
evidence of heat-fractured rock, or burned rock (Thoms et al. 1981). The artifact density for low
density artifact scatters were less than 10 artifacts per 25 meters squared. The initial stages of
lithic reduction are represented due to the availability of the chert resources to determine if their
interiors were suitable for manufacturing stone tools (Thoms et al. 1981). These low-density
artifact scatters did not warrant additional investigations and no further work was recommended
(Thoms et al. 1981). Overall, the survey resulted in the documentation of 113 archeological sites,
42 low-density artifact scatters, and five isolated finds, and 15 of the total 160 cultural resources
were selected for further investigations. Site 41LK139, LDS4, and LDS5 were not selected as part
of the Choke Canyon research plan for Phase II investigations (Thoms et al. 1981).
In 2014, the site was revisited for a pipeline corridor survey north of the project APE (41LK137
Site Form, Atlas 2017). The revisit expanded the site boundaries to the east along the proposed
pipeline corridor. The investigations determined the site was not NRHP-eligible within the
proposed pipeline corridor and no further work was recommended.
The Choke Canyon Reservoir investigations identified numerous resources that included
prehistoric campsites, lithic scatters, and historic sites which resulted in a series of reports on the
archeology of the region (Hall et al. 1986). Based on the investigations and intensive research of
the area, the findings determined that the research methodology for cultural resources should
focus on cultural resources sites with the potential for containing discrete strategraphic
components, intact features with archeobotanical and faunal remains. Within the Choke Canyon
area, these sites typically occur on terraces alongside major drainages in the reservoir basin (Hall
et al. 1986).

IV. Methods of Investigation

IV. Methods of Investigation
The primary goals of this investigation were to (1) locate any cultural resources that may exist
within the Survey Area; (2) assess their potential for NRHP eligibility; (3) assess the effect of the
proposed construction on the located resources; and (4) provide site-specific recommendations
for mitigation of adverse impact to any NRHP-eligible properties or properties of unknown
eligibility.

Class III Survey Investigations
Atkins archeologists conducted a Class III intensive archeological survey of the proposed project
area that was of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and, if possible, significance
of any cultural resources located within the APE. The survey included a pedestrian walkover and
surface inspection with shovel testing within 100 percent of the project area by qualified
archeologists. These procedures are in accord with the BLM survey standards in consultation with
the District BLM archeologist and Procedures for Performing Cultural Resource Fieldwork on
Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico BLM Responsibilities, BLM Manual Supplement H-81001 New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (BLM 2005).
As part of the survey efforts, a BLM cultural buffer zone was added to the proposed well pad site,
access road, and pipeline corridor per BLM survey standards. The APE includes 22.20 ac of
proposed construction impacts and 17.52 acres of BLM cultural buffer zone. For the well pad site,
a 30 m (100 ft) cultural buffer zone was added to the exterior western and northern boundaries of
the 9.6-ac pad site. The buffer expanded the survey area of the well pad site to approximately
12.7 ac in size, exceeding the 10-ac minimum for well pad sites. The southern and eastern exterior
boundaries of the well pad site abut the parcel boundary and work will not extend beyond the
private property. For the access road and pipeline corridor, a 15 m (50 ft) cultural buffer zone was
added on either side of the 7.3 m (24 ft) wide access road and 24 m (80 ft) wide pipeline corridor.
The pipeline corridor encompasses approximately 0.83 km (0.52 mi) of the access road, so the
cultural buffer zone was added to the corridor with the furthest extents. The survey transects were
15 m (50 ft) wide and shovel testing was performed in areas with heavy ground surface vegetation
(80 percent or more of the surface obscured). Following THC’s (Texas State Historical
Commission [SHPO]) survey standards, one shovel test per 2 ac for survey areas 11–100 ac in
size is required, or six shovel tests for the 12.7-ac for the well pad site. For linear projects, 16
shovel tests per linear mile of a 30 m (100 ft) wide right of way is required, or 19 shovel tests for
the proposed access road and pipeline corridor, approximately 1.23 mil (1.97 km) in length.
Shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and were excavated by natural
strata where possible, or in levels not exceeding 10 cm (4 in) thick. Shovel tests were excavated
to clay substrate or to 80 cm (31.5 in) below surface (cmbs) unless cultural material is encountered
in the test. If cultural material was encountered, subsurface testing continued to clay substrate or
until excavation of the unit was no longer feasible due to depth (generally beyond 100 cmbs or 39
in below surface). All excavated fill was sifted through 6.4-millimeter (¼-in) mesh hardware cloth.
All shovel tests were recorded using a GeoXT Trimble Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver

using NAD 83 datum. For each of the excavated shovel tests, the following information was
recorded on shovel test forms: location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. All shovel
tests were backfilled upon completion.

Site Recording and Evaluations
Archeological sites encountered were delineated horizontally and vertically within the APE. Per
THC standards, sites were delineated with a minimum of six shovel tests or by visual inspection
on sites with more than 30 percent ground surface visibility. A sketch map was completed in the
field, depicting the landform and delineation shovel tests for each resource. Sites identified during
field investigations were recorded on a State of Texas Site form.
Newly documented cultural resources were evaluated according to the NRHP criteria for
evaluation (Criteria) under 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 60.4 (36 CFR 60.4), which
states:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture
is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association and;
a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent
a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;
or
d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

Curation
Atkins proposed a no-collection survey on private property and BOR lands. Project records will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

Field Conditions and Survey Findings
The field investigations were conducted between April 18 and 20, 2017, by Atkins personnel
consisting of Laura I. Acuña and Justin Rains. The survey investigations covered approximately
37.72 acres) in total, which included 20.2 ac of APE and approximately 17.52 acres of the BLM
cultural buffer zone. In general, the vegetation within the Survey Area ranged from moderately to
densely vegetated and the ground surface visibility ranged from 30 to 60 percent. In densely
vegetated areas, the ground surface visibility dropped to less than 30 percent. Disturbances
across the survey area included man-made berms, compacted two-track roads, and evidence of
land clearing activities such as push-piles and graded surfaces. The disturbances increased
ground surface visibility from 60 to 80 percent in portions of the Survey Area. Entirely within an
upland setting, naturally occurring chert cobbles and gravels were observed across much of the
survey area and diminished as the landform sloped south.
The APE consisted of the proposed access road, new pipeline corridor, the well pad site, and
BLM cultural buffer zones. A total of 45 shovel tests were excavated during field investigations
with approximately 38 shovel tests within the proposed access road and pipeline corridor and
seven within the well pad site (Figure 3, Appendix B). Only five shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials, four associated with site 41LK139 and one with an isolated find. Shovel tests
had an approximate average depth of between 30-40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) before encountering clay
and/or gravel subsoil impediments. The average shovel test consisted of silty clay loam over a
silt clay and the lower layer often contained inclusions of calcium carbonate, gravels, and/or base
layers of mixed caliche.

Access Road and Pipeline Corridor
The survey investigations consisted of three 15-m-(50 ft) wide transects for the access road and
pipeline corridor. The BLM cultural buffer zone north of the project area was not surveyed as it is
within private property outside of the proposed APE. In addition, the area is within an existing
pipeline corridor outside of the survey area. Shovel testing was limited to the vegetated areas as
the existing two-track yielded 100 percent ground surface visibility (Figure 4). The investigations
confirmed the location of previously recorded site 41LK139 and two low density artifact scatters
identified during the previous investigations. Naturally occurring chert cobbles and gravels were
observed across much of the survey area with a general density of 40 to 60 percent of the surface.
The two drainages that intersected the project area were densely vegetated (Figure 5). However,
the channel for both drainages was not clearly defined, lacking banks or terraces. Of the 38 shovel
tests, 30 shovel tests were within 41LK139, of which four were positive. Positive shovel test LA13
was an isolated find, Isolated Find IF01. A hunting camp building and shed were identified within
the APE, but on further inspection they were determined to not be of historic age (Figure 6).

Well Pad Site
The Survey Area of the well pad site is approximately 12 acres in size and includes 9.6 acres of
the proposed APE. The investigations of the well pad site consisted of 16, 15-m (50-ft)-wide
transects. The majority of the well pad site is moderately to densely vegetated with ground surface
visibility ranging from 20 to 60 percent. The well pad site is intersected by existing two-track roads
with evidence of land clearing activities in the form of push-piles and graded areas (Figure 7 and
Figure 8). A total of seven shovel tests were excavated within the well pad site with negative
results. Two shovel tests, LA16 and LA17, contained evidence of disturbances of the surrounding
area, specifically burned rock that is likely associated with modern land-clearing activities
associated with the two-track roads. The shovel tests were excavated near the intersection of the
two-track roads and push-piles. The density of naturally occurring chert cobbles tapered down
from 60 percent to 10 percent, and less than 10 percent in some areas.

Cultural Resources Findings
Isolated Find IF01
Isolated find IF01 was encountered within shovel test LA13 and consisted of a tested cobble within
0 to 10 cmbs. The ground surface visibility of the area was 80 to 100 percent, thus delineation
focused on surface inspection rather than shovel testing (Figure 9). Four shovel tests also were
excavated as part of the delineation of shovel test LA13, with negative results (Appendix C). No
additional artifacts or features were observed on the surface. The vegetation was sparse and the
density of naturally occurring chert cobbles was less than 10 percent across the ground surface.
The isolated find was located on a south-trending slope south of the upland ridge top. The tested
coble was approximately 5 cm in size and of an unknown prehistoric affiliation. Based on the
findings, the artifact was designated as an Isolated Manifestation under BLM standards. No
further work is recommended.

Site 41LK139
The investigations relocated previously recorded site 41LK139 within the project area. Under BLM
survey standards, the site is designated as a Category 1 site. The investigations expanded the
site boundaries to include artifact scatters that were identified west of the site in 1977, but not
recorded. Thus, the site is approximately 1,625 m (5,334 ft) long and approximately 24 m (80 ft)
wide within the APE. The site extends outside of the existing APE based on previous
investigations for the site and the “low-density artifact scatters” (Appendix C). Vegetation of the
site consisted of typical South Texas thornbrush and cacti. The ground surface visibility at the
time of investigations ranged from 40 to 80 percent. Much of the site has been negatively impacted

by the land clearing activities associated with the development and improvements of two-track
roads that intersect the site.
Previous Investigations
The site was recorded initially in 1977 during a survey by the Cultural Resources Institute (CRI)
of Texas Tech University with The University of Texas of San Antonio (Thoms et al. 1981). The
1977 investigations identified a scatter of burned rock and secondary flake fragments within the
upland landform. The site is located east of two “low-density artifact scatters”, LDS4 and LDS5,
that are within the same upland setting and intersected by two drainages. The previously recorded
“low-density artifact scatter” LDS4 is 2,750 m by 325 m in size and LDS5 is 950 m by 450 m in
size (Thoms et al 1981). The artifact density for 41LK139 was recorded at four artifacts per square
meter. The CRI investigators did not include the low-density artifact scatters as part of 41LK139.
The site was intensively surveyed and no features or significant artifacts were encountered during
the investigations. Although the site itself could not be dated to a specific time period due to lack
of diagnostic artifacts, the previous investigations determined the Choke Canyon region had an
extensive Archaic occupation (Thoms et al. 1981). Subsequent investigations of sites in the region
as part of the Choke Canyon research series determined sites along terraces over major creek
and river channels have the potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits (Grant et al. 1986).
In 2014, site 41LK139 was revisited during a pipeline corridor survey north of the current project
area. The investigations identified some lithic tools, bifaces, and a moderate scatter of burned
rock and flakes (20143 41LK139 site form, Atlas). The investigations noted a high concentration
of chert cobbles and gravel. The site had been impacted by the construction and installation of an
existing pipeline. The sites boundaries were expanded to reflect the extents of the scatter within
the pipeline corridor, but no significant diagnostic artifacts or features were identified. The site
within the surveyed portion was recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP and no further
work was recommended (2014 41LK139 site form, Atlas).
Current Investigations
The artifact scatter of 41LK139 was identified within the previous boundaries of the site. As noted
in the previous investigations, the scatter was interspersed with naturally occurring chert cobbles
and consisted of burned rock, tested cobbles, primary and secondary flake fragments. The
investigations expanded the site boundaries to include a positive shovel test excavated (JR01)
within previously identified “low-density artifact scatters” recorded during the 1977 survey,
designated as LDS4 and LDS5 (Thoms et. al 1981). The surface surrounding the shovel tests
west of the original site boundaries of 41LK139 consisted of a high concentration of naturally
occurring chert cobbles interspersed with tested cobbles correlating with the location of the “lowdensity artifact scatters” (Figure 10 and 11). The scatters consisted of tested cobbles, flakes, and
cores that extend across the upland landform. The artifact density was generally 10 per 10 m2
and no distinctive activity areas were observed.
A total of 30 shovel tests were excavated within the expanded site boundaries, of which four
(JR01, JR05, LA07, and LA09) were positive. The materials encountered within the shovel tests
consisted of burned rock (n=6), tested cobbles (n=2), and a modified flake (n=1) within 0 to 30

cmbs. The soils consisted of silty clay loam over clay and generally were excavated to 30 cm in
depth.
Much of the APE within the site boundary has been disturbed by land-clearing activities
associated with the two-track road (Figure 12 and 13). Within the APE, push piles of soil and
vegetation debris were observed as well as areas of disturbance due to wild hogs (Figure 14).
The artifact distribution of the site was generally four artifacts per square meter as previously
recorded. However, a concentration of artifact materials was identified; specifically, two structural
debris push piles (F01A, F01B) and two burned rock cluster areas (F02A, F02B) observed within
the APE near the northeastern corner of the proposed access road and pipeline corridor.
Push pile F01A consists of corrugated tin sheets, wooden planks with wire nails, wooden fence
posts, and barbed wire (Figure 15). The push pile is approximately 10 m in diameter. Other than
the wire nails and barbed wire, no other historic-age artifacts were observed. A review of historic
maps and aerial photography did not reveal any historic-age standing buildings within the area.
In addition, no buildings were identified within 41LK139 during the 1977 CRI investigations. The
debris likely represents a former hunting shed that was destroyed. The property is seasonally
utilized as a deer lease and hunting camp by the property owners. Push pile F01B is located
approximately 12 m southeast of F01A. The push pile consists of wooden planks with wire nails
and a toilet seat attached to a wooden board with an opening (Figure 16). Based on the toilet
seat, the debris likely represents a former outhouse associated with the hunting shed. The latrine
area was not observed within the APE.

V. Cultural Resources Results

Approximately 15 m east of F01A and F01B, two burned rock clusters, F02A and F02B, were
identified. The burned rock clusters were initially designated as features, but on further inspection
the clusters did not contain any distinct soil staining or pit associated with a firing episode or

hearth. The scatter consisted of a thin layer of heat fractured rock within a cleared area with
vegetation push piles surrounding the clusters. The cluster F02A measured 7 by 3 m in size and
contained 104 burned rocks within a square meter area, for a total of approximately 2,184 burned
rock fragments (Figure 17 and 18). The burned rock consisted of angular and subangular
fragments that were 5 cm and less than 5 cm in size. Artifacts observed on the surface include
18 flakes, seven tested cobbles or cores, two modified flakes, one biface fragment, and one
project point fragment (Figure 19). The projectile point fragment was the proximal end of a dart
point, possibly Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic of the Angostura or San Patrice type (Figure
20). One piece of clear glass with a red and white paint was also encountered (Figure 21). One
shovel test was excavated within the center of the cluster (JR18) with negative results. No staining
or charcoal was observed within the shovel tests and it was terminated at 30 cmbs.
The cluster F02B also measures approximately 7 x 3 m in size and contains approximately 106
burned rocks per square meter, for a total of approximately 2,226 burned rock fragments (Figure
22 and 23). Like F02A, the burned rock ranged from 5 cm to less than 5 cm in size and consists
of angular and subangular pieces. On the surface, artifacts observed include 26 flakes, five tested
cobbles or cores, two modified flakes, and one complete biface (Figure 24 and 25). Shovel test
LA18 was excavated within the cluster with negative results and no evidence of soil staining or
charcoal. Other material observed within the cluster included metal wire, wire nails of various
sizes, and square cut nails of various sizes. Although the square nails can serve as a temporal
historic marker dating to the late 19th to early 20th century, the evidence of the artifacts within the
site likely represents a secondary context. A piece of corrugated tin and a metal plank was also
observed just north of the burned rock cluster within a push pile of vegetation and soil (Figure 26).
The clusters represent burned rock scatters impacted by land-clearing activities that have shifted
and altered the lithic scatter’s original context on the surface. It is possible the burned rock is a
result of burning activities associated with the destruction of the former hunting shed and
outhouse or land-clearing activities. No distinct soil staining, pits, or basins were observed on the
surface. Because of the lack of diagnostic materials and intact buried deposits, the clusters do
not represent a significant cultural activity area of site 41LK139.

Evaluation of Significance and Eligibility Determinations
The isolated find, IF01, is an Isolated Manifestation under BLM standards and does not meet
NRHP Criteria A, B, C, or D of 36 CFR 60.4 for evaluation. No further work is recommended for
IF01.
Portions of site 41LK139 within the current APE was evaluated under NRHP Criteria A and D,
which considers the site’s potential to contribute to the broad patterns of history or prehistory and
the potential to yield information important to the prehistory of the region, respectively. The site
does not contain any extant buildings or extensive historic-age archeological materials for
evaluation under Criteria B or C. The site represents a surface lithic scatter of burned rock and
flakes, and procurement areas with possible limited processing activities typical of the region.
The low-density artifact scatters recorded in the region occur primarily on gravel ridge tops and
slopes and represent limited quarry activities (Thoms et al. 1981). No distinct cultural activities,
such as extensive processing, heat-treatment areas, or campsites were observed within the lithic
scatter areas within the western extents of 41LK139 during the current survey. In addition, the
subsequent BOR survey of the road within LDS4 and LDS5 did not encounter features or
diagnostic artifacts (Etchieson 1983). Continual erosion and land-clearing activities have reduced
the integrity of cultural resources on the surface (Thoms et al. 1981). Overall, low artifact density
scatters have little to no potential to contribute to the understanding of settlement patterns or
artifact processing techniques in the Choke Canyon region.
The dart point fragment suggests a general Archaic occupation, possibly Early Archaic. Although
the site represents quarry activity area, the site lacks distinct cultural activity areas, features, or
buried deposits within the APE that would provide additional evidence on settlement patterns for
the region. In addition, the site has been negatively impacted by land clearing activities which has
disturbed the original context of the lithic scatter on the surface. The site lacks preserved cultural
deposits with diagnostic materials that would contribute to the cultural chronology of the region.
Intact lithic procurement and processing sites are rare for the region due to the activities
associated with ranching, hunting, and oil and gas leases. In addition, previous investigations of
the site determined 41LK139 and the “low-density artifact scatters” as not containing significant
data to warrant further investigations (Thoms et al. 1981).
Although the site retains its integrity of location and setting, the site lacks integrity of design,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. The level of disturbance encountered within the
APE has compromised the integrity of the site which has displaced most of the surface artifacts
from its original context and reducing the ability to identify discreet processing and procurement
areas. The site lacks the potential provide additional information on the broad patterns in
prehistory (Criterion A) or yield information important to the prehistory of the region (Criterion D).
Based on these findings and previous investigations, Atkins recommends the site within the APE
as not eligible for listing in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

Determination of Effect
Isolate Find IF01 will be impacted by the construction and installation of the proposed pipeline.
The site is a prehistoric isolate of unknown age consisting of a tested cobble located within a

shovel test. Site IF01 is designated as an Isolated Manifestation under BLM survey standards
and no further work is recommended.
Site 41L139 is a prehistoric lithic scatter with tested cobbles, burned rock fragments, debitage
flakes, and some lithic tools dating to an Archaic occupation. The previous investigations in 1977
determined the site and the adjacent “low-density artifact scatters” as not eligible for listing in the
NRHP (Thoms et al. 1981). The low-density scatters were not previously recorded as sites due
to the ubiquitous nature of lithic landscapes on landforms with naturally occurring chert cobbles.
A subsequent investigation of the site in 2014 expanded the boundary, but also determined the
site was not eligible for listing in the NRHP. The site will be impacted by the proposed access
road and pipeline corridor. Based on the findings, the portion of the site within the proposed APE
is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP. Based on the subsurface sampling, the
site lacks intact buried deposits and has been negatively impacted by land-clearing activities
associated with ranching, hunting, two-track road development, and oil and gas. Approximately
70 to 80 percent of the site within the APE is disturbed, down to the upper 10 to 20 cm of the
ground surface. Additional investigations would not yield important information to the prehistory
of the region (Criterion D) or contribute to the broad patterns of prehistory (Criterion A). Although
a portion of the site will be affected by the proposed undertaking, no further work is recommended.
Since no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP under 36 CFR
60.04, Atkins recommends no further work and a finding of no historic properties present within
the project. No further consideration of the resources under Section 106 is recommended for the
current project.

VI. Summary and Recommendations

VI. Summary and Recommendations
On behalf of Statoil, Atkins completed cultural resources investigations within the proposed USA
21 project that includes a well pad site, access road, and pipeline corridor. The work included a
background review, an intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 20.20 ac of proposed
construction impacts and 17.52 acres of BLM cultural buffer zone for a total of 37.72 acres of
APE. The background review determined that the entire APE was previously surveyed for cultural
resources.
The investigations consisted of a Class III intensive pedestrian survey within the APE. The
pedestrian survey revealed that the APE has been severely disturbed by frequent land clearing
activities associated with the maintenance of the two-track roads. The ground visibility ranged
from 20 to 60 percent, and 45 shovel tests were excavated within the APE. During the investigations, site 41LK139 was relocated and expanded within the survey area and an isolated find
(IF01 2) was recorded.
Site 41LK139 is a prehistoric lithic scatter with tested cobbles, burned rock fragments, debitage
flakes, and lithic tools dating to an Archaic occupation. Atkins evaluated the site under Criteria A
and D for listing in the NRHP. The expanded site represents a procurement area with possible
limited processing activities typical of the region. A dart point fragment suggests a general Archaic
occupation, possibly Early Archaic. Although the site represents procurement area, the site lacks
distinct cultural activity areas, features, or buried deposits within the APE that would provide
additional evidence on settlement patterns for the region. The site has been negatively impacted
by land-clearing activities associated with ranching, hunting, two-track road development, and oil
and gas. The site will be impacted by the proposed access road and pipeline corridor. However,
the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Based on the findings, Atkins recommends no further work for the portion of the site within the
APE.
Isolated Find IF01 consisted of a prehistoric tested cobble of unknown age within a shovel test at
0 to 10 cmbs. The isolate did not contain any evidence of cultural activity areas, features, or
diagnostic artifacts. Isolated find IF01 as an Isolated Manifestation under BLM survey standards
and no further work is recommended.
