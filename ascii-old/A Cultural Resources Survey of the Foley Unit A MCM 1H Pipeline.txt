Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the 1.1mile Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline to be developed by by Mockingbird Midstream Gas
Services, L.L.C. (Mockingbird) in northwestern McMullen County, Texas. The project was
entirely privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately
owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing of high probability areas was conducted by
two archaeologists on August 17, 2011. During the survey, it was obvious that much of the rightof-way had in the recent past been mechanically disturbed. The only evidence of cultural
material observed along the right-of-way consisted of two isolated prehistoric chipped stone
cores.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the Foley Unit A MCM 1H
Pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that
if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such
finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black
Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr. Ryan Debarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, and Mr. Ronnie Glenewinkel, Environmental Coordinator at Mockingbird
Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall
knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope
of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner. Also, I very much appreciate Dr. Thomas

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested a
cultural resources survey of the
proposed 1.1-mile Foley Unit A MCM
1H Pipeline in northwestern McMullen
County, to be developed by by
Mockingbird Midstream Gas Services,
L.L.C. (Mockingbird), and hereinafter
occasionally referred to as the Project
Area (PA) (Figures 1-3). Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted the field survey
along the right-of-way on August 17,
2011.
Figure 1. Location of McMullen County and the
Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline project in Texas.

Modern Environmental
Setting
Climate and Vegetation
McMullen County is located in southcentral Texas mid-way between the
Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Rio
Grande to the west (see Figure 1). Its
current political boundary encompasses
1,159 square miles. The generally flat to
rolling terrain ranges in elevation from
about 150-450 feet above mean sea
level. Clayey and loamy soils support
the growth of small predominately
mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush
with assorted cacti, chaparral, and
grassy understory. With its semi-arid
environment, the county is generally
frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for a 290-day
growing season. The average annual
rainfall is about 24 inches (Leffler
1996). However, rainfall amounts vary Figure 2. Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline on large
significantly from year to year, and the topographic map.

effects in the area
effectively offset any
beneficial surplus of annual
rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation
systems are so
necessary, and
commonly found in use
today throughout the
area. Summers are
indeed hot and dry, with
temperatures
consistently hovering
above 1000F, although
humidity is generally
low compared to
environments closer to
the Gulf Coast. Overall,
the county’s climate can
be classified as
subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and
the Rio Grande are the
major southeasterly
trending rivers draining
the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through
the county causes
numerous intermittent
creeks to flow south Figure 3. Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline on Pertle Creek (1969) 7.5'

and others to drain toward the north, and into the Frio River. Many drainages intermittently flow
into both rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of abundant rainfall. Although there are many
springs in McMullen County, very few are active due primarily to the dip of the substrate shales
which carry these subterranean seeps to the south and east. Ancient springs that may have existed
in the area at one time have likely succumbed to overgrazing and irrigation pumping during
modern times (Brune 1981). During our investigation of the project area in February 2011, we
observed no water flowing, or niche pools.
Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
2

Gould (1975), and the regional flora of
South Texas has been classified as
being part of the Tamaulipan biotic
province extending out from northeast
Mexico (Figures 4 and 5). This is the
only part of Texas where some
vegetation exhibits growth throughout
the year (Blair 1950; Map 2011).
Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland mixed
with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and
ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and
the exclusion of fire, the invasion of
woody species has changed the
vegetation into “Texas brush country”
dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny Figure 4. Physiographic regions of Texas
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al.
1987:203-221). On sandy soils, the
brush includes mesquite with mixed
grasses. In contrast, clay soils support
mesquite (Proposis juliflora), various
species of Acacia, and mimosa,
granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis
pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera
angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum
texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana),
prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri),
tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and
species of Condalia and Castela (Blair
1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country
exhibits some of the greatest
mammalian species diversity in the
state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36
snakes, 19 lizards, and several species Figure 5. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
3

of turtles, salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50
species of fish have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline project lies within the South Texas Archaeological region
as defined by Hester (1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south
Texas is problematic, due to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity
of stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of
information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for
prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
4

Clovis-type points across most
of North America and even into
Central America suggests a
wide dispersal and interaction
of the people who made them.
Other artifacts associated with
the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades,
engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, ochre, and
shaft straighteners. During the
late Paleoindian interval, the
first stemmed lanceolate points,
such as Angostura, Golondrina,
St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber
(among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian
adaptation has been considered
to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse, across North
America (Black 1989).
More recently, emphasis has
been placed on the wide
diversity of plants and animals
used for subsistence by these
early Americans, such as turtles
and tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons, although
they undoubtedly hunted the
large animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual
sites, and burials (Hester
1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis.
Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas; Figure 6. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
however, no camp sites or chronology.
5

killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County
(Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic
scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological
sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a
movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating
6

to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between
ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1999) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
7

about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
8

By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

McMullen County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in McMullen County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to McMullen County were squeezed out
by other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from
the south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the
Nueces and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who
had escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
9

area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and
early 1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county.
For protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 2011).
Prehistoric Site Potential
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of McMullen County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods.
Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large
open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous
campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered
animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher
terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect
stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the McMullen
county areas, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the
Spanish forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s,
there are documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been
noted to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day Mc Mullen county (Chipman
1992).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Mc Mullen county were considered safe enough for white settlers to begin establishing
smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many roving bands of angry
Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native American groups (Leffler
1996). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early ranching activities along the
Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline, but the expectations of encountering any archaeological site
of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along the line were minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to
identify what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites
have been documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that
describe the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide
insight as to the types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent
to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried
cultural materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
There are 225 documented archaeological sites in McMullen County. Of those, 147 are prehistoric
open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the county have been occupied
from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. As with most of the region, many campsites
are situated on stream terraces, but there are also some in the uplands. Fifty-nine sites are
classified as lithic scatters, and generally these are located in the uplands and along stream
cutbanks where gravels outcrop. They also exhibit evidence of being used for the past 11,000
years. One quarry site has been recorded in the county, as has a single sandstone burned rock
midden. The only prehistoric burial noted was found at one of the open campsites. Historic sites
consist of local family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from
as early as the 1850s, and trash scatters (Atlas 2012).
As shown in Figure 3, TAAI has conducted a survey of the McKenzie South Lateral. However,
no evidence of cultural material was observed along that right-of-way (Nickels 2011a, b). In
addition, a review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites
(Atlas 2012) indicated that there had been eight prehistoric archaeological sites recorded near the
northwestern portion of the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline. Seven of the eight were recorded
by E. R. Mokry, Jr. in 1975, and with the exception of one site for which no information is
available other than its location, a brief description of each site follows.

11

41MC321
41MC321 is a prehistoric open campsite with fire-cracked rocks from hearth features, a variety
of stone tools, and lithic debitage. It is located some 200 meters north of Leoncita Creek, at the
confluence of two intermittent drainages. No diagnostics were observed, so its period of
occupation is unknown without further investigations.
41MC322
At this site are the remains of an 1850s to early 1900s homestead or ranch house. All that
remained of the structure(s) in 1975 were sandstone slabs. However, a variety of household
ceramics, bottle glass, wood stove parts, and the fragment of a ceramic doll provides some clues
as to not only the occupation period, but also the occupants during that time period.
41MC323
This is a prehistoric open campsite with a fire-cracked rocks, Zavala and Perdiz arrow points, and
Leon Plain pottery sherds. These diagnostics, along with bison bone remains and beveled knives
suggest a Late Prehistoric, Toyah phase occupation, sometime between perhaps 700-300 years
B. P. (See Figure 6). Other cultural material observed at the site includes deer and rabbit faunal
remains, mussel shells, and chipped stone gouges, scrapers, cores, and hammerstones.
41MC324
The Scallorn arrow point found at this site implies a Late Prehistoric, Austin phase period of
occupation, sometime between roughly 1250-70 years B. P. (See Figure 6). However, other
artifacts found at the site such as a Perdiz arrow point, Leon Plain pottery sherds, beveled knife
fragments, smoothed sandstone slabs, and large mammal bones suggest it was also occupied by
Late Prehistoric, Toyah phase bison hunters sometime between roughly 700-300 years B. P. (See
Figure 6). In addition, E. R. Mokry, Jr. observed mussel shells, bifaces, cores, and lithic debitage
spread across the surface in 1975.
41MC325
The cultural remains observed in 1975 at this site are very similar to those observed at 41MC324,
i.e., Toyah phase Perdiz and Fresno arrow points, Leon Plain pottery sherds, mussel shells, and
large mammal bones. In addition, E. R. Mokry, Jr. noted the existent of chipped stone blades,
another example of Toyah phase technology.
41MC326
The projectile points found at this site imply that it was occupied at least twice, but during
different periods in prehistory. A Tortugas point implies an early Middle Archaic period
occupation, roughly 4000 B.P., while the discovery of Edwards and Ensor points on the surface
suggest later Transitional Archaic or early Late Prehistoric occupations about 1250-700 B. P. (see
Figure 6). Other chipped stone pieces observed on this site include Clear Fork gouges, scrapers,
and hammerstones.

12

41MC327
41MC327 appears to have been the earliest occupied site of the seven that E. R. Mokry, Jr.
recorded in 1975. His documentation of Plainview and Golondrina basal fragments at the site
(Mokry 1976) suggest that Paleoindian hunters and gatherers were there perhaps as early as 8800
B.P. In addition, this was obviously a favored campsite over the ensuing several thousand tears
as evidenced by the presence of Abosolo and Tortugas dart points from the Middle Archaic, an
Ensor point from the Late or Transitional Archaic, and a Scallorn point from the early, Austin
phase of the Late Prehistoric. Other pieces of chipped stone observed on the site included Clear
Fork gouges, scrapers, and cores.

Old Maps, Aerial Photographs, Historic Research
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the Nueces
and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who had
escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and early
1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county. For
protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 2011).
A standard source of review is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Casteñada Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Casteñeda
Library 2012). Although this source would normally prove invaluable for researching the
possibility of, and potential for, historic sites and structures to exist within one mile of a project
area, in this case the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline route is in such a rural area that no old maps
or aerial photographs were available. A second standard research source consulted for old maps
and aerial photographs was a very comprehensive and large compilation of old maps and aerial
photographs compiled by the Texas Department of Transportation from dozens of historic
archives throughout the state of Texas. Once again, the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline route
appears to be in a rural area of McMullen County that either warranted little attention, or the area
was void of historic structures.
Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
13

information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area. Technically, any structures
old than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this
should be considered when the pipeline right-of-way is excavated. Historic sites recorded in
McMullen County consist of local family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites
and farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash scatters. In addition, as discussed above, E.
R. Mokry, Jr. documented site 41DM32, an historic site dating to the 1850s-1900s within close
proximity to the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline route.

Soils
Although a work in
progress, McMullen
County is the last of 254
counties in Texas whose
soils are yet to be fully
mapped. As illustrated in
Figure 7, soil types along
portions of the route have
been mapped, while other
portions have not as yet
been
mapped.
Nevertheless, the soils
that have been mapped
are Dos Rios clay,
Imogene fine sandy loam,
and Tordia clay. These
soils types are consistent
with the varying terrain
in the northwestern
portion of McMullen
County, and as such, the
potential for buried and
intact cultural resources
varies with the terrain
and soils (Web Soil
Survey 2012). Table 1
provides a
brief
description of the soil
types, and their potential Figure 7. Soils to be dissected by construction of the Foley Unit A
for buried deposits, and MCM 1H Pipeline.
thereby implying their
potential prehistoric significance.
14

Table 1. Soils Dissected by the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline .
Soil Series

Typical Soils, Areas and Depths

Buried and Intact
Archaeological Potential

Dosrios clay (DsB)

Deep clay on convex interfluves
and slopes

Minimal to <8 inches below the
surface

Imogene fine sandy loam (ImB)

Deep sandy loam on low stream
terraces and floodplains along
creeks

Moderate to about 22 inches
below the surface

Tonio fine sandy loam (TOB)

Deep loamy soil on gently
undulating uplands

Minimal to Moderate to about 30
inches below the surface

However, soil maps are just one indicator of the potential for intact cultural materials to exist, and
the dynamics of stream deposition and aggrading terraces must also be considered. In this case,
the Foley Unit A MCM 1H Pipeline courses through potential terrace deposits through Leoncita
Creek where the probability of potentially significant archaeological sites has been demonstrated
by the documentation of sites in the area by E. R. Mokry, Jr. in 1975.

Field Survey Goals, Methodology, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic survey
methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of high probability areas along the
1.1-miles, meandering back and forth across the right-of-way. Surface visibility ranged from 90
to 100 percent, and all cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles were thoroughly
examined.

15

A total of six
shovel tests were
dug (Figure 8) in
20-cm levels, and
all sediments were
screened through
1/4-inch wire
mesh. Following
our designed
research plan, any
artifacts recovered
from shovel tests
were not to be
collected, but were
to be placed in the
upper 10 cm of the
backfilled shovel
test. The results of
shovel testing were
fully documented
on Shovel Test
forms, are on file at
the

request.

A MCM 1H Pipeline .

Results of the Investigations
A pedestrian survey, with systematic shovel testing along high probability areas was conducted
by two archaeologists on August 17, 2011. No evidence of prehistoric or historic artifacts were
observed on in any of the six shovel tests excavated, or in any of the numerous cutbanks
examined. However, two chert cores were observed on the surface downstream and in near
proximity to previously recorded site 41MC323. They are described as follows:
16

Isolated Find #1
Isolated Find 1 is a chert core found on the eroded surface of an upper terrace on the edge of
Leoncita Creek. As shown in Figure 8, it is made from gray, non-heated chert. An examination
of a nearby cutbank revealed no evidence of cultural materials or buried soils (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Chert core; Isolated Find #1.
Isolated Find #2
Isolated Find #2 is a chert core found in the
bottom of Leoncita Creek, likely washed
downstream from site 41MC323. As shown in
Figure 11, it is made from light grayish brown,
non-heated chert.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

A pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing of high probability areas was conducted by two
archaeologists on August 17, 2011. During the survey, it was obvious that much of the right-ofway had in the recent past been mechanically disturbed. The only evidence of either cultural
material observed along the right-of-way consisted of two isolated prehistoric chipped stone cores.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the Foley Unit A MCM 1H
Pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that
if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds
should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant. be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.
