POTTERY OF THE EL PASO REGION
BY EILEEN E. ALVES
The pottery found in the vicinity of El Paso,
Texas, presents an amazing number of different
types. A collection of sherds made from one of the
wind swept, water washed village sites, about half
a mile long by a quarter of a mile wide, situated
within fifty miles of El Paso, will include a
representation of types known in Arizona, New
Mexico, and Old Mexico, as well as
types less widely scattered.
The sherds described in this article
are surface finds only, no known
stratigraphic work of any importance
having been done in this locality. Very
few refuse piles, or remains of buildings
suitable for stratigraphic work, have
been found in the ruins near here.
This paper is a mere statement of
pottery found, and does not pretend to
do more than report the many types of
pottery scattered on mesa and plain
within a fifty miles radius of El Paso.

A red and black on brown pottery is
found here in the greatest abundance,

of pottery in this region. It is called El Paso Black
and Red on Brown, or El Paso Polychrome.
A whole bowl found near Newman, New
Mexico, contained several beads, twelve

and two lumps of some other mineral. The black
and red geometrical figures on this coarse brown
bowl make a rough but handsome appearance.
This pottery is found in great quantities as far
south as Casas Grande in Mexico, but seems to fade
out towards Three Rivers, New Mexico.

Chuperdero
Another common example here is the black on
white pottery called Chuperdero; very different
from the beautiful black on white Mimbres. This
Chuperdero pottery is a familiar type of sherd on
our old village sites. The square base, the grey color
and the rough striated interiors as if done by a coarse
brush, and the rather crude decorations
are among its characteristics.

3. Top: Corrugated and coiled ware.

4. Miscellaneous; handles, coarse, brown, and buff ware.

A few sherds, apparently of this
same ware, found at Hot Wells Ranch
had a very delicate pink wash over the
interior. Otherwise it resembled the
same black on white Chuperdero. Most
likely it was simply an individual idea
of the potter making it, without any
significance.
Little Colorado and Middle Gila
Polychrome.
These two kinds of pottery or very
close relations are found in sufficient
quantities to put them out of the stray or
intrusive class. They are usually
represented in every village site
although in very small quantities.
Mimbres and Casas Grande
Polychrome
Mimbres is ordinarily found at
every site, which is true in a much
lesser degree with Casas Grande or
Chihuahua polychrome. It is generally
conceded that Mimbres is the older of
the two. The clear cut designs of black
on white, the smooth interior, and the
naturalistic or geometric figures are of
extreme beauty.
Three fourths of a wonderful bowl
was found along the Ruidoso River in
the White Mountains. It had a
naturalistic design of a mountain sheep
filled in with a very complicated
geometric pattern. This may tend to
carry Mimbres culture rather further
