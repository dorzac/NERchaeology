ABSTRACT
This report is a presentation of the results of a field
survey in specified areas of Inks Lake State Park, Burnet

The survey was directed toward evaluating

the archeological resources existing in proPQsed areas
of modification.

An examination of the land surface yielded

no definable archeological sites.

Recommendations are offered

for mitigating anticipated adverse impacts in the study area
in case of subsurface finds.

Submitted to the Texas Department of JCbmmunity Affairs by
the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin in fulfillment of terms of existing contract· lAC

INTRODUCTION
An archeological reconnaissance of portions of Inks
Lake State Park in Burnet County, Texas (Fig. 1) was con­
ducted by the Texas Archeological Survey, The University
of Texas at Austin under terms of an existing contract with
the Texas Department of Community Affairs.
Inks Lake is 10 miles west of Burnet in Burnet County,
Texas and 4 miles below Buchanan Dam on the Colorado River.
The state park "consists of 1200 acres of land, on an 803
surface acre, constant level lake" (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department 1973:5).
Hilly terrain and granite outcroppings dominate the
study area.

Small trees, shrubs and grasses are the main

vegetation.

Detailed information concerning the physiography,

geology and biota can be found in the following sources:
Fenneman 1938; Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1932 and Blair 1950.
In viewing the archeology of the area one should remem­
ber that during prehistoric times Inks Lake did not exist.
The present study area was an upland river valley region.
The major water source was the Colorado River.

Two secondary

water sources which pass through the study area are Clear
1

2

and Spring creeks.

These creeks now empty into Inks Lake.

According to a U.S.G.S. 30' quadrangle map (Burnet, Texas,
1909) and U.S.G.S. 7.5' quadrangles (Longhorn Cavern, Texas,
1967 and Lake Buchanan, Texas, 1967) of the area, creation
of Inks Lake caused the waters of the Colorado River to
inundate land up to 3/4 mile from the previous river banks
as shown in the earlier map (1909).

This information is

critical in suggesting an explanation for the paucity of
archeological resources in the study area.

Previously re­

ported sites are located along the banks of the lake and
are also known to be underwater as well.
Study Aims
The archeological survey was superficial in nature
with only one preliminary subsurface test excavated in Area

"s" (Fig. 1) and was directed toward the fulfillment of
the following requirements:
(1)

Determine if archeological resources exist within
the specified areas of the park;

(2)

Identify, record and appraise and/or re-appraise
the significance of resources found;

(3)

Evaluate the impact of installation of proposed
facilities on each resource;

(4)

Issue a written report providing findings, evalua­
tions, analysis, conclusions and recommendations.

Previous Archeology
In 1965 two archeological sites (41 BT 59 and BT 60)
were located and recorded in the study area (Crawford 1965).
These sites were stated to have contained Archaic and "NeoAmerican" artifacts.

A survey was made in the Proposed

Sewerage Irrigation Field (Master Plan 1973 :66) by D. Lorrain
(Roberson 1974).
sites were found.

During that restricted reconnaissance no
In June, 1974, W. Roberson and D. Lorrain

conducted a survey of the revised Proposed Sewerage Irriga­
tion Field (Roberson 1974).

No archeological sites were

found during that reconnaissance.

SURVEY PROCEDURES
Prior to field survey an inspection was made of the
archeological files at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).*

Maps and site records were consulted

to determine if any sites had been previously recorded in
the immediate study area.
Maps used during the field survey included U.S.G.S.
7.5' quadrangle maps, aerial photographs and maps furnished
by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
The present field survey was carried out in the fol1ow­
ing designated areas of the park (Fig. 1):
(1)

Proposed Camping Area "K";

(2)

New Headquarters Location Area "e";

(3)

Proposed New Attendant's Residence "R";

(4)

Day Use Area "E";

(5)

Boy Scout Camping Area "P";

(6)

Proposed Trailer Group Rallying Area "Q";

(7)

Proposed Primitive Camping Area "8".

Sites were described on site survey forms and surface
collections made.

Limited surface exposures of flint and/or

SURVEY RESULTS
Survey within the seven proposed areas for modification
revealed only one definable prehistoric archeological site
(Fig. 1), 41 BT 60.

This is a previously known site which

was re-appraised during the present survey.

The site was

in an area which had been modified and only a few artifacts
were collected.

The second of the two previously recorded

sites (41 BT 59) was not located (in Area "Q") due to dense
vegetation.

There is also the possibility that since its

discovery in 1965 the site has been destroyed by erosion
and other factors involving the use of the area by campers.
Although no archeological sites were defined there
were areas where concentrations of flint debitage were ob­
served.

However, only 5 or 6 flakes were encountered, not

enough cultural evidence on the surface to warrant assign­
ment of site numbers.

It should be noted that these areas

may yield subsurface materials if the present surfaces are
modified.
The areas where these surficial concentrations were found
are the following:

Area "K" (very small amount); Area "s"

and on the dirt road just north of Area "S".

Area "s" is

by far the most undisturbed area which was dealt with in
8

9

the present survey.

In that area 2 grinding stones, some

biface fragments and a small amount of flint flakes were
collected from the surface.

This low yield perhaps is due

to heavy foliage and a thick mantle of organic material on
the surface.

A subsurface test

~n

one limited part of Area

"s" suggests that this portion is not worthy of site desig­
nation.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of this reconnaissance designed to locate
and assess archeological sites to be affected by proposed
modifications in the study area were negative in the sense
that no definable archeological sites were located.

41 BT 60

was re-appraised; however, it is not within the specific
boundaries of the present study area.
recommended for that site.

No further work is

From the materials collected

in the areas surveyed no definitive statements concerning
archeological temporal placement can be made.

However, two

dart points from 41 BT 60 were found to be of the types
En

and Ellis.

Temporal placement of these dart points

is the late Archaic and post Archaic according to Suhm and
Jelks (1962:187-190),

This substantiates the other materials

found in 1965.
After assessment of the study areas for their archeo­
logical resource potential it was found that there was in­
sufficient cultural evidence on the surface to indicate the
presence of prehistoric archeological sites.

However, it

should be noted that subsurface occurrences are within the
realm of possibility.
In view of present knowledge of past land forms a constant
10

11

source of water for prehistoric inhabitants would possibly
have been too far away from the present study area; and
perhaps for this reason few

arche~logical

resource~_were

located in these upland areas.
The only recommendation, proposed for mitigating antici­
pated adverse impacts is that the Texas Historical Commission
and/or the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Master
Planning Division) be notified if apparent archeological
remains are encountered during any modification processes.
