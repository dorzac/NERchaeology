AN ANALYSIS OF THE PREHISTORIC CERAMICS FROM
THE RICHLAND-CHAMBERS CREEK DAM AND
RESERVOIR PROJECT AREA, NAVARRO AND
FREESTONE COUNTIES, TEXAS
Marilee Irvine

ABSTRACT
The pottery from the tested prehistoric sites of the Richland-Chambers
Archeological Project has been classified according to attribute analysis. As a
result of the analysis 10 classes of pottery were identified-two plainwares and
eight decorated wares. These classes have been compared to recognized types
when possible to obtain information on intersite distribution and temporal
placement. The data indicate that ceramics may have been used in the area as
early as the Late Woodland period. Pottery types recognized as Early Caddoan
also were identified, but no Late Caddoan pottery was found.

INTRODUCTION
Ceramic analyses traditionally have been carried out in order to establish
cultural chronologies and to provide information about specific ceramic-related
activities at archeological sites. Throughout North America, regional chronologies based on pottery typologies are common and, in most cases, well refined.
Unfortunately, the boundaries created by regionalism have caused considerable
confusion in areas where research is in its early stages. The tendencies by
archeologists to view their regions within analytical vacuums discourage interregional comparisons, thereby producing limited pictures of ceramic variability
and resulting in the creation of numerous noncomparable pottery types based
on localized descriptions.
The description of ceramic collections should provide useful data not only
for cultural and historical purposes, but also for comparisons of intrasite and
intersite variability. The present study is concerned with the identification of
ceramic groups based on analysis of certain physical attributes. These attributes were chosen because they provide data necessary for classification (Shepard 1971), because they are useful temporal indicators, and because they provide data necessary for resolution of specific questions in the research design
for the Richland-Chambers Project.
The Richland-Chambers Project is a program of archeological survey, testing,
and mitigation being carried out on the 50,000-acre (20,300 ha) RichlandChambers Dam and Reservoir area in Navarro and Freestone counties, Texas
(Figure 1). An intensive survey of the project area, followed by testing at
many sites, was accomplished in the first phase of archeological activity.
Ceramics were found at 24 of the 43 prehistoric sites that were tested. Each

sherd recovered was subjected to an attribute analysis in which seven attributes
were recorded:
temper, paste texture, surface treatment, thickness, color,
form, and decoration. The ceramic classes described in this paper were developed from significant attribute clusters within the ceramic sample.

CERAMIC DESCRIPTIONS
The ceramics recovered from the tested sites have been divided into two main
categories, based on exterior surface treatment. These two categories, plain and
decorated wares, have been subdivided into finer groups for more meaningful
identification.
The plainware sherds are classified according to the major
tempering materials used; the decorated sherds are classified according to the
mode of decoration (e.g., engraved, brushed, incised). Whenever possible,
comparisons have been made to recognized pottery types. In addition, vessel
form was determined when possible, since it might have some functional implications.
The sample collected was small (278 sherds) and provided little information
about vessel morphology. The few rim and base sherds in the sample permit, at
best, only approximations as to vessel size and function. In most cases, morphological determinations are based on analogy to other areas where whole
vessels were abundant (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Brown 1971).
Plainware
A total of 197 plainware sherds have been analyzed from 21 tested sites.
All of these sherds are undecorated, with smoothed and unburnished exteriors.
Two temper combinations were observed: grog, grit, and bone; and grit and

Irvine-Ceramics from Richland-Chambers

bone. These tempering materials were identified mainly by the unaided eye,
but occasionally a microscope was used. In this report the tempering agent
listed first is the one that appeared to occur with the highest frequency in the
paste. It should be noted that the 197 plain sherds may not be a valid indication of the number of plainware vessels in the sample, because some of the
"plainware" sherds may have come from undecorated parts (often everything
except the rim) of decorated vessels. Unfortunately, it is not possible to
distinguish between sherds from plainware vessels and sherds from undecorated
parts of decorated vessels; therefore, all of the undecorated sherds were put in
the plainware category.
GROG, GRIT, AND BONE TEMPER
Among seven rim sherds in the sample are sherds from standing and everted
rims, both direct and thinned. These rims suggest simple bowls, carinated bowls,
and jars used mainly for utilitarian purposes. The three base sherds in the
sample are from flat-based or conical-based vessels. The vessels were manufactured by the coiled technique, evidenced by the breaks on many sherds
(coiled pottery breaks along the coils, on horizontal planes).
More than 95 percent (189) of the plainware sherds have grog and grit temper
(i.e., grog with grit inclusions). The pulverized bone inclusions range in size
from microscopic to 2 mm. The paste is generally well mixed, coarse, and lightly porous, probably due to leaching of the bone. Both interior and exterior
surfaces are predominantly fine smoothed and uneven. They appear to be unburnished, but the surfaces of many sherds have been eroded away. Wall thickness ranges from 4 to 16 mm.
Interior and exterior colors range from brown to red and gray. Interiors are
generally darker, often dark brown or gray. Cores are usually solid and dark,
but occasionally they have zoned color differentiations. This zoning, together
with a high incidence of fire clouding, indicates uneven firing temperatures.
These plainware sherds resemble the type Sanders Plain from the Sanders
site in northeast Texas (Krieger 1946:186). They are also similar to Williams
Plain, a common type in southeastern Oklahoma and northeast Texas (Irvine
1980:15-20). Williams Plain is known from the Wister phase in the Wister
Valley, and Sanders Plain is affiliated with the Sanders focus of northeast
Texas.
GRIT AND BONE TEMPER

The six remaining plainware sherds are tempered predominantly with grit
(sand) and occasional pieces of pulverized bone. In this group are two standingrim sherds with thinned, rounded lips. No vessel forms can be inferred from the
rim morphology.
The paste texture is medium, well mixed, and compact. The grit is probably
a natural component of the clay, not an additive. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and fine smoothed, probably due to the eroded condition of the sherds.
The surfaces definitely feel sandy where the grains rub off when touched.
Thickness ranges from 4 to 8 mm. Interior surfaces are dark, mainly dark gray,
and exteriors are shades of brown and red. Cores are generally solid and dark;
fire clouding is present on some exterior surfaces.

Decorated Ware

Eight kinds of decorative techniques are present in the sample: engraving,
brushing, incising, punctating, slipping, and combinations of these (Figure 2).
Unfortunately, due to the small size of most of the sherds, few decorative modes
could be identified, and for that reason specific type identifications were difficult, if not impossible.

ENGRAVED
Engraved line designs were found on 19 sherds (Figure 2,a,b,c), six of which
came from a single vessel. This vessel, a small carinated bowl with a slightly
everted rim and rounded base, was identified as Carmel Engraved (Figure 2,a),
an Alto focus pottery from northwestern Louisiana. Carmel Engraved designs
consist of curving bands of transverse lines that produce a ladder effect. Usually
two of the curving bands are separated by an undecorated band, and engraved
lines sometimes flank each band or bisect the intervening plain band (Webb
t963:156). The temper contains grog, grit, and bone; the paste is compact and
coarse. The interior surfaces are mostly unburnished, the exteriors are burnished, and both surfaces are smoothed. Thickness ranges from 6 to 7 mm.
Colors are dark; cores are dark and solid.
Other engraved sherds have design modes consisting of single and multiple
parallel and perpendicular lines. The three rim sherds-two standing and one
inverted-have engraved lines running parallel to the rims. An incomplete crosshatched design (Figure 2,b) banded by a single line, and a scalelike overlapping
design (Figure 2,c) also are present in the sample. None of these were affiliated
with any previously defined types.
The temper contains grit, grog, and pieces of bone. The paste has a mediumto-coarse, well-mixed, compact texture. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and
fine smoothed. Thickness ranges from 5 to 8 mm. Colors of both the interiors
and exteriors are mainly light browns, although several dark interiors are present.
Cores are solid and usually the same color as the interiors. The majority of
surfaces are fire clouded.
BRUSHED
Sherds with brushed decoration are the second largest part of the sample.
Brushed decoration consists of striations made by dragging bundled stiff grasses
along the plastic exterior surface of a vessel (Figure 2~g). The designs in this
group show no apparent banding, which suggests that the motif probably consisted of random brushing over the entire body of the vessel. No orientation
was discernible, although the striations often intersect diagonally or at right
angles.
The most common tempering material is grit, with minor amounts of grog
and bone. The paste is compact and typically coarse. The interior surfaces
are usually burnished and smoothed; exterior surfaces are unburnished and unsmoothed, although occasionally the brushing is incompletely smoothed. The
thickness of these sherds ranges from 5 to 8 mm. The interiors of most of the
sherds are dark gray, but some are light brown and red. The exterior colors are
mainly light browns and reddish browns. Cores are solid and dark, usually the
same color as the interiors. Fire clouding is present on the majority of sherds.
There are no rims or bases with brushed decoration in the collection.

(g) brushed; (h) punctate-incised; (i) incised.
INCISED
Incising is the most common decorative technique (Figure 2,d,f) in the
sample.
Among the incised sherds are two identifiable as Canton Incised.
A common Canton Incised motif is a crosshatched design along or just below
the rim, and a series of parallel lines diagonal to the rim. This motif occurs
on three rims in the sample. This type was originally defined from the Sanders
site in northeast Texas (Krieger 1946). Its chronological placement is within
the Sanders focus during the later part of the Gibson aspect, around A.D. 1000
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:23).
Other design elements include single and multiple parallel lines that intersect
diagonally and at right angles. All of these design elements are incomplete,
and some may be fortuitous juxtapositions. Both sharp and blunt instruments
were used for incising, and the lines are fairly well executed. Seven rim sherds
were collected, of which three are standing, three are everted, and one is inverted. All rims are either thinned or direct, with rounded tips. Three of the
rims have sets of parallel lines running horizontally or at right angles to the lips.
No vessel forms were distinguishable in the sample.
Tempering materials consist of grog, grit, and particles of pulverized bone.
Paste texture varies from medium to coarse and is usually compact. Surfaces
generally are unburnished and fine smoothed. Wall thickness ranges from 6 to
9 ram. Shades of brown are the predominant colors, usually with darker interiors. Cores are solid and are the color of the interiors or darker. Fire clouding
is present on a number of sherds.
PUNCTATED
Two different techniques of punctated designs occur in the ceramic sample.
Indentations made by a fingernail or by a blunt instrument occur on 11 sherds.
None of the sherds has a clear design; the punctations appear instead to be

190

Texas Archeological Society

placed at random over much of the body area (Figure 2,e). One everted rim has
punctations around the lip.
The major tempering material is grit (sand) with grog and bone. The paste
texture is coarse and compact. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and fine
smoothed. Wiping marks are visible on most interior surfaces. Sherd thickness
ranges from 6 to 11 mm. Colors recorded for the interior surfaces are mostly
dark browns and grays. Most exterior colors are lighter browns, but there are
some grays. Cores are solid and are the color of the interiors or darker. Fire
clouding is present on the majority of sherds. Punctation is a common form of
decoration at Caddoan sites. Earlier punctated ceramics have random designs,
and the later styles usually are zoned. The punctated pottery from the Richland-Chambers area is probably early, associated with the Sanders focus (Story
1965:231-232).
PUNCTATE-INCISED
Two sherds make up this category, which is characterized by a combination
of random fingernail punctates and incised lines (Figure 2,h). The two sherds
are tempered with grog and grit. The paste is coarse, compact, and well mixed.
Surfaces are unburnished and highly eroded, giving the sherds a rough feel to
the touch. Thicknesses areâmeasured as 7 mm. The interior surfaces are dark
gray, and the exteriors are pale brown. The cores are solid and dark. No fire
clouding is apparent on the surfaces of the two sherds.
PINCHED

Two pinched sherds are present in the sample. The surfaces of these sherds
are pinched with the fingers, leaving mounds or ridges in the clay. The sherds
are too small to have identifiable patterns. One of the sherds is a direct rim
sherd that has a square lip.
Grog, grit, and bone are the tempering materials. The paste varies from
medium to coarse, but is compact and well mixed. The interior surfaces are
smoothed and burnished; the exteriors appear to be eroded and unburnished.
Thickness ranges from 7 to 8 mm. Colors range from pale brown interiors to
dark gray and light red exteriors. Cores are solid and generally darker than the
interiors.
PUNCTATE-PINCHED

Two of the sherds have a combination of fingernafl-punctate and pinched
design modes. No motif is apparent due to the small size of the sherds. The
temper is primarily grit with grog and bone. The paste texture is coarse and
compact. Surfaces are both burnished and unburnished and fine smoothed.
Thickness ranges from 6 to 9 mm. Surface colors are dark browns and grays;
the cores are dark and solid.
SLIPPED-ENGRAVED
A single slipped-engraved sherd was identified in the sample. The slip is dark
red and covers both surfaces. Two parallel lines are engraved on the exterior
surface. The temper is grog and grit, the paste is medium and compact, and
both surfaces are smoothed and highly burnished. The sherd is 7 mm thick.
Both interior and exterior are dark red, and the solid red core is an indication

Irvine-Ceramics from Richland-Chambers

191

of the oxidizing nature of the firing medium. This sherd has been identified
tentatively as Sanders Engraved, a type affiliated with the Sanders focus in
northeast Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962:137).

Discussion
Ten ceramic classes have been identified and described from the sample:
two classes of plainware sherds and eight classes of decorated sherds. All of the
sherds are tempered with grit, grog, and minor amounts of pulverized bone.
The paste texture, depending upon the tempering materials, ranges from medium
to coarse, but usually is compact and well mixed. Few sherds have suffered
any amount of leaching of material from the paste.
The frequency of burnishing is highly variable and is probably the result of
the eroded condition of the sherds. Some of the unburnished surfaces have a
chalky film that rubs off. The sherds with greater amounts of grit in the paste
have fine-smoothed surfaces and textures similar to sandstone. Interior surfaces
occasionally carry incompletely smoothed wiping marks that were created
during the process of shaping the vessel and thinning the walls.
The sherds in the sample from the Richland-Chambers Project area range in
thickness from 4 to 16 mm. Most of the sherds-particularly the decorated
ones-are between 5 and 8 mm thick. The plain sherds are generally somewhat
thicker, but this is due to the thick base sherds in the plainware sample. Fortysix Munsell colors have been recorded for the sherds: the most common colors
are browns and grays in all shades. The interior surfaces are usually darker than
the exteriors. Most cores are a solid color, although there are some zoned cores.
The solid cores are generally as dark as or darker than the interior colors. The
zoned cores occur as the result of uneven firing temperatures and often are
associated with the presence of fire clouds on pottery surfaces.
The majority of the sherds are from the bodies of vessels, and they provide
little information about vessel morphology. Twenty rim sherds and four base
sherds were recovered. Most of the rim sherds are from standing rims, both
direct and thinned, with mostly rounded lips. It is difficult to determine vessel
types from the few rim sherds, because the rims are small and difficult to orient
since no shoulders are present. Except for one small carinated bowl, no vessel
forms could be positively identified. The existence of certain vessels can only
be inferred from the sample.
Four base sherds were recovered, but only one provides information on basal
morphology. This one is from the round contoured base of the carinated bowl.
Partial reconstruction of one vessel base shows it to be a fiat disc-shaped slab
onto which the coils for the vesse! walls were applied. The size and weight
of the base suggest that it was a fairly large pot-one that would not have been
easily carried due to its weight. The vessel was probably a simple jar used for
storage purposes.
The decorated sherds represent 30 percent of the total ceramic sample
(Table 1). Only 12 of the 24 sites produced decorated sherds, few of which
can be identified with existing types because they are small, and little reconstruction has been possible. Few complete design motifs can be found. Most
of the decoration consists of single and multiple lines, random brushing, and
punctation marks. Incised4ine designs are the most common, followed by

brushed decoration and engraved line designs. Punctate designs also are common
in several different combinations. The sample contains only one slipped sherd.
DISTRIBUTION
Almost all of the tested sites have been disturbed by land modification
activities, including plowing, burning, and clearing, which in turn have exposed
the sites to further disturbance from erosion, artifact collecting, and animals.
All of these disturbances can greatly modify a site.
The hmited testing undertaken by the project produced a small ceramic
sample; only three sites have collections large enough to be considered representative. In each of these sites (41FT201, 41NV173, and 41NV203), squaremeter test units yielded enough ceramics to warrant an analysis of vertical
distribution. The test units at other sites were either shovel tests or backhoe
trenches that lacked vertical provenience.

Intrasite Distribution
The majority of the collection from the tested sites comes from the surface
(Table 2). The total from Level 1 is actually larger, but Level 1 includes the
sherds from Level 1 in the square-meter test units and the sherds from the
shovel tests, which also were designated Level 1. Thus, the figures presented
for Level 1 are inflated and do not represent the actual distribution. The numbers for Levels 2 through 8 are for those levels alone and indicate a decrease in
ceramics in the lower levels.
Table 3 presents the vertical distribution of sherds from the square-meter
units at sites 41FT201, 41NV173, and 41NV203. Two units were excavated
at 41FT201, and ceramics were recovered from the first eight levels. The
distribution in Unit 21 at 41FT201 is one of decreasing frequency from the
upper to the lower levels. The distribution of sherds from Unit 23 at 41NV173
is similar to that of Unit 22 at 41FT201.

Unit 22 at 41FT201 and site 41NV173 (Unit 23) both appear to be disturbed. The distributions for the two units are not what would be expected
for a site that might have been occupied over a long period of time. A more
logical distribution is seen in Unit 21 at 41FT201 and in site 41NV203, where
the highest frequencies are in the upper levels; they drop off and disappear in
the lower levels. Unit 22 at 41FT201 appears to have been disturbed to a
depth of at least 1 meter. This conclusion is based on the presence of a human
burial recovered from the square. The profile at 41NV173 (Unit 23) indicates
that some disturbance has also occurred in that area. The disturbances might
account for the unusual ceramic distribution.

Intersite Distribution
The 24 tested sites produced ceramics in varying quantities (Table 2). Three
of the sites produced over 60 percent of the total sample. When the sites are
considered separately, they do not provide much information about specific
site activities, but when the site distributions are plotted, a pattern of areal
settlement can be seen.
Five geographic contexts were identified among the site locations (Table
4). Terrace sites were the most frequent, followed by flood plain terrace,
erosional remnants, tributary stream, flood plain, and creek bank sites. Most
of the sites are along Richland Creek or close to the Trinity-Richland confluence (Figure 1). The five tributary stream sites are along Richland Creek;
two are near the Richland-Trinity confluence, and two are some distance away
on the western edge of the project area. Most of the terrace sites are near the
Richland-Chambers confluence, where there are greater expanses of flood plain.
All are multicomponent sites with earlier, Archaic components.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The introduction of pottery into parts of Central and northeast Texas
roughly corresponds to the Late Woodland in the Southeast and Midwest (Story
1981). Radiocarbon dates are limited, but there are acceptable dates around
A.D. 1 (Galm 1978) for surrounding areas. Few adaptive changes have been
associated with the introduction of ceramics. The use of pottery apparently
spread rapidly because of its advantages over other containers (Story 1981).
The ceramics from the Richland-Chambers area are closely related to pottery
from northeast Texas, which is mainly grog tempered with some bone (Krieger
1946:186 ; Newell and Krieger 1949:235 ; Story 1981). The plainwares from the
Richland-Chambers area are the type usually classified as Williams Plain (Story
1981), a type originally described at the Williams site in southeastern Oklahoma
(Newkumet 1940). Radiocarbon dates from southeastern Oklahoma establish
the existence of Williams Plain as early as 100 B.C. (Galm and Flynn 1978:
155).
In East Texas these early ceramics are later integrated into Caddoan wares
associated with Early Caddo complexes in the Arkansas Valley (Brown 1971).
This Early Caddo period-the Gibson aspect-is represented by the Sanders
and Alto foci in northeast Texas. Pottery types associated with these foci
have been found in the project area. Carmel Engraved is an Alto focus
pottery, and Canton Incised is known from the Sanders focus. Other decorative techniques represented in the collection, such as brushing (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981) and random punctation (Story 1965:231), have been identified as Early Caddo traits. All of the sites assessed as Late Prehistoric that
contain ceramics can be related to the Early Caddo period in the RichlandChambers area.
Ceramics from the Fulton aspect (Late Caddo period) do not seem to be
represented in the project area. This could be the result of the sampling
technique or of the inability to recognize the associated ceramics due to pre-

196

viously discussed limitations of the sample. Nonceramic artifacts from these
sites indicate later occupations than do the ceramics. More excavation is
necessary to provide additional ceramic materials that may shed some light
on this problem.
The distribution of sites in general, and of sites with ceramics in particular, shows that a pattern of site distribution is evident: the density of
sites is greater close to the Trinity River and along Richland Creek; the
density of sites is much lower along Chambers Creek. This difference may
be due in part to environmental factors.
Influence from areas outside of the Rich_land-Chambers area is seen in the
ceramics. This influence is mainly from northeast Texas and occurs relatively
early with the introduction of Williams Plain pottery. This influence continues through the Early Caddo period and probably longer, although it is
not evident from the ceramics.
It is interesting to note that almost all of the 43 prehistoric sites tested
were multicomponent sites with both Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The analysis showed that of these 43 sites only 24 yielded ceramics,
and only a few yielded ceramics in any quantity. The reason for this dearth
of ceramics is unknown, but there may be several causes. First, the testing
procedure employed at the sites could have created a bias in the sample.
Second, the sites without pottery may represent special activity areas where
ceramics were not used. In any case, the sites with Late Prehistoric occupations would be expected to contain pottery in their artifact assemblages.
A mitigation proposal for the Richland-Chambers Project area includes
the excavation of several significant sites that will provide enough ceramic
data for further analysis. Such excavation might answer the questions raised
in this report and might also extend the limits of the current investigation,
posing many new research questions.
