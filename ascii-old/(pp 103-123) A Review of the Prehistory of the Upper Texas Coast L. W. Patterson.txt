ABSTRACT
The overall prehistory of the upper Texas coast is reviewed, with archeological data currently available from both published and unpublished sources. Recent
research progress is noted and recommendations for areas of future research are
given.

INTRODUCTION
Until recently, a significant amount of published information was not
available on the prehistory of the upper Texas coast. In the last regional
reviews of Texas archeology (Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society,
1958), the upper Texas coast was not covered by a separate summary. In the
recent past, the upper Texas coast was considered to be archeologically unknown. It is now possible to present an outline of the overall prehistory of this
region. Much work remains to be done, however, before a detailed synthesis
of this region can be made.
Wheat’s (1953) survey of a bayou system west of Houston was the first
publication of detailed archeological information in this region. It is still one of
the most important information sources in the literature today. The Texas
Archeological Survey, Texas A & M University and the Houston Archeological Society have been the principal organizations conducting research. Some
work also has been done by Rice University and Southern Methodist University.
Work by professional groups has not been regionally uniform, due to
funds being available mainly for the survey of new water reservoirs and flood
control projects. This situation has led to more published information being
available for littoral and marshland sites than for adjacent inland areas. However, more balanced information is now becoming available.
Both professionals and amateurs have made significant contributions to
the regional archeological data base; and good cooperation exists between
these groups. The Houston Archeological Society assisted professional
groups in surveys and excavations of the Livingston (McClurkan, 1968) and
Wallisville reservoirs. The Late Prehistoric Mitchell Ridge site complex on
Galveston Island was originally surveyed by the Houston Archeological Society; and was the location of the 1978 TAS annual field school. This site is
being used as the basis for a doctoral dissertation (Bruce, ms.).
There is some ethnographic data available for this region and several
archeological sites were recorded with evidence of European contact. However, this article is a review of only the regional prehistory. Based on the files
of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the majority of

104

Texas Archeological Society

archeological sites on the upper Texas coast do not have evidence of European contact.
Research progress covering the upper Texas coast has been steady over
the past 15 years. The last published regional bibliography (Patterson, 1979a)
contained 228 entries, a 37% increase over a previous issue (Patterson,
1976a). Much of the current work by professional groups has limitations on
research contributions due to the nature of contract archeology for environmental impact studies (Patterson, 1978a).

DEFINITIONS OF REGION
The upper Texas coast is a 20 county region (southeast Texas) of coastal
and adjacent counties, bounded on the west by the Brazos River and on the
east by the Sabine River (Fig. 1). With minor differences, this is the same as
Campbell’s (1958:178) previous definition. Archeological studies have not
been made uniformly throughout this region. However, a number of sites are
recorded in all counties involved (TARL). Detailed resolution of many archeological questions must await a more uniform survey of the entire regiom
The upper Texas coast has several ecological zones, including coastal
plains, mixed woodlands, marshlands, and littoral areas. Water resources
include fresh water, brackish water, and salt water areas. There are some
corresponding changes in aboriginal subsistence patterns.
In a broader sense, this region joins the boundaries of several geographical and cultural areas (Willey, 1966:Fig. 1-1), including the Eastern
woodlands, Gulf coast, and Southern Great Plains. Willey (1966:329) includes the upper Texas coast in a northeast Mexico -- south Texas region,
apparently based on the Archaic lifeway practiced over most of his defined
region.
The Upper Texas coast exhibits some variations in subsistence patterns.
Differences are due to localized food resources. However, this region was
very conservative in regard to cultural change. This conservatism would be
expected of peoples engaged only in nomadic hunting and gathering activities.
The post-Pleistocene environments in this region may have been relatively stable over a long time period (Jennings, 1974:70). However, there
were climatic fluctuations (Bryson et. al., 1970:Table 3~ Gunn and Weir,
1976:Fig. 2) which could affect subsistence activities at any given time. The
greatest differences in climate and environment would have occurred during
glacial maximum. The coastal land area would have been greater then (T. C.
Patterson, 1973:16-17).
The post-Pleistocene period experienced a continuing subsidence of the
Gulf coastline, aggravated in modern time by high withdrawal rates from
coastal freshwater aquifers. In respect to changes in sea level, Gagliano
(1977: I) stated that "The possibilities for drowned habitation sites on the Gulf
shelf, then, is from 55,000 to 3,500 B.P." Although a number of early littoral
sites now may be underwater, there has not been any success in locating
underwater sites (L. E. Aten, personal communication).
There have been a number of continuing changes in river and stream
routes that must be accounted for in archeological studies of this region. Old
stream meanders are easily observed from the air. Prehistoric sites on Gulf

coast barrier beaches of Northeast Texas cannot be very old as these beaches
were formed in the Late Holocene, after 6,000 B.P. (Gagliano, 1977:Plate
1). Other references to the geology of this region include Bernard et al.
(1970) and Fisher et al. (1972, 1973).

CHRONOLOGY
Little data for absolute dating of archeological remains are available for
this region. Aten (1971:Fig. 10) synthesized a culture trait chronology,
mainly for post-ceramic periods, for locations on the Texas coast from
Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay. The broad time periods of archeological traits generally used in studies of adjacent regione seem to apply fairly well
to artifact types in the stratigraphic sequence of the upper Texas coast and are
used. Caution must be used, however, as there may be regional differences in
absolute chronologies of the uses of various artifact types. There are few
radiocarbon dates available for the upper Texas coast before the Late Archaic.
The earliest recognized human occupation in this region is the Paleoindian period, approximately 7,000 to 12,000 B.P. (Jennings, 1974:Fig.
3.27; Prewitt, 1974:Fig. 7). According to Muller-Beck (1967:Fig. 1), this is
the terminal Pleistocene. The termination of the Paleoindian period has not
been established with great chronological precision.
The earliest materials are a few undated surface finds of Clovis fluted
points (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:177; Long, 1977). Long (1977) described
finds of both classic and eastern varieties of Clovis points found on a beach

near Beaumont. This area could have been a grassland area before coastal
subsidence. Evidence is unavailable in this region for slightly later Folsom
fluted points.
Hester (ms.) summarized the Late Pleistocene archeology for the entire
Texas coast, but details remain vague due to small data base. Many Paleoindian sites may be presently underwater due to coastal subsidence. It is common to find Pleistocene faunal remains on or near coastal beaches (Long,

1977).
Archeological surveys connected with oil and gas well drilling in underwater locations have found nothing of significance to date, despite several million dollars in study funding. Jackson (1979) stated that $16 million was spent
on 676 surveys to November, 1978 with no archeological finds located by
OCS Cultural Surveys. However, there are traces of early Paleoindian occupation in this region. Internal records of Shell Oil Company (personal examination) list several radiocarbon dates for elephant remains on the upper
Texas coast, but not in apparent association with human artifacts.
The next chronological period to be considered is the Archaic. This is
generally accepted as a post-Pleistocene period ending with the start of
ceramics (Jennings, 1974:213). For the upper Texas coast, the Archaic extended from the end of the Paleoindian period (7,000 B.P.) to the start of
pottery (approximately 1,900 B.P.) (Aten et al., 1976:Fig. 16). This time
span differs from Prewitt’s (1974:Fig. 7) definition of the Archaic for Central
Texas, where the Archaic ends at 1,200 B.P. However, pottery appears
earlier on the upper Texas coast. For discussion, the Archaic period is divided
arbitrarily into an Early period (7,000 to 5,000 B.P.), a Middle period (5,000
to 3,500 B.P.), and a Late period (3,500 to 1,900 B.P.). These time brackets
are convenient for use in comparison with artifact types and dating in adjacent
regions.
The transition from Paleoindian to Archaic is vague and an exact chronological sequence for artifact types is unavailable. Regional differences in
Texas appear to exist. For example, the Plainview point type is considered to
be Paleoindian at Lubbock Lake, radiocarbon dated to approximately
10,000 B.P. (E. Johnson, personal communication). Suhm and Jelks
(1962:239) showed the possible occurrence of Plainview points as late as
6,000 B.P. (not based on radiocarbon dates) in Central and East Texas.
McCormick (1976:40) noted the presence of Scottsbluff Paleoindian type
points on early Archaic sites in Northcentral Texas~
Radiocarbon dating of cultural remains from the Early Archaic has not
been done in this region. The data base for this period is too small for development of even a relative chronological sequence. Another problem in developing definitions of various time ranges is that some types of projectile points
were used for long time periods.
Several types of projectile points that are generally recognized as Late
Paleoindian or Early Archaic are found in this region. These include: Plainview (Wheat, 1953:213; McClure, 1977:11; McGuff and Cox, 1973:21;
Patterson, 1978b:3; Aten et al., 1976:30; Patterson, 1976b); San Patrice
(Duke, 1971; McClure, 1977:11; Long, 1977; McGuff and Cox, 1973:21;
Patterson, 1978b:3); Angostura (Ambler, 1967:Fig. 23; Patterson,
1978b:3); and Scottsbluff (Bickley, 1964).

The San Patrice point type has been particularly difficult to assign a temporal placement because of conflicting data. Wheat (1953:211, type 124)
gave an example in apparent post-ceramic context, although this could be
due to stratigraphic mixing. Most examples seen to place the San Patrice
point type at least somewhere in the pre-ceramic Archaic period.
Some points were found in the lowest stratum of site 41HR315 (L. W.
Patterson, field notes) in northwest Harris County. These points fit Shafer’s
(1977:Fig. 4) description of Early Stemmed points. Long (1977) illustrated
Greenbriar Dalton points from the Beaumont beach area. This type usually is
regarded as transitional Paleoindian/Archaic (Goodyear, 1974). McGuff
and Cox (1973:21) reported Meserve and Lerma points in Harris County.
These points are from the transitional period (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:207).
Aside from projectile points, few other cultural remains are currently
available from the Early Archaic period. Both the Paleoinidan and Early Archaic appear to be periods of low density occupation in this region.
Evidence for occupation in this region during the Middle Archaic period
consists of projectile point types dated to this time period in Northcentral
Texas (Smith, 1969; McCormick, 1976; Suhm and Jelks, 1962). A general
characteristic of points from this time period is basal grinding. There is some
stratigraphic evidence for the early placement of these point types in Harris
County (Patterson, 1978b:3; Wheat, 1953: Table 5). Examples of these
point types for the upper Texas coast are: Carrollton (Duke, 1971; McClure,
1977:13; Patterson, in press a; 1978b:3; 1979a:Fig. 1; 1976c:173); Trinity
(Patterson, 1976c: 173, in press a); Williams (McClure, 1977:11; Patterson,
1976c:173, in press a); and Wells (Patterson, in press a).
The Bulverde point type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:169) may start early in
this time period, as in Central Texas (Prewitt, 1974:Fig. 7), but continues well
into later periods (Patterson, 1978b:3). There is some evidence that dart
points of the general Gary/Kent category may start in the Early to Middle
Archaic period (Wheat, 1953:Table 5; Patterson, 1978b:3). A Pedernales
point and bone tools were found in the lowest stratum of site 41AU36. Associated radiocarbon dates range from 4708 + 147 B.P. (TX-2453) to 3617 _+
126 B.P. (TX-2127), using the Arizona correction (Hall, 1978, 1979, in
press).
A large amount of data is now available for the Late Archaic period. This
period is immediately before the start of ceramics. Projectile point typology
for this period is summarized by Wheat (1953), McClurkan (1968), Shafer
(1968), and Patterson (1976c). Numerous sites with components of this time
period were published in the Houston Archeological Society Newsletter by
W. L. McClure and L. W. Patterson (Patterson, 1979a).
Typical dart points of this period are Gary, Kent, Ellis, Palmillas, Ensor,
Refugio, and Yarbrough. Many dart point types continue into the Ceramic
period (Wheat, 1953:Table 5). Group II burials of site 41AU36 (Hall, 1978,
1979, in press) fall into the Late Archaic, with radiocarbon dates from 2585
+ 124 B.P. (TX-2451) to 1639 + 81 B.P. (TX-2452). Fairland, Kent, and
miscellaneous expanding stem points were present in the burials.
The Late Archaic appears to be the start of intense use of many sites.
Large collections of lithic debitage are found on most sites of this time period,
indicating a high level of lithic manufacturing activity.

The term Woodland has been used for a number of years (Patterson,
1974a, 1976c) to define a time period for the upper Texas coast from the start
of ceramics to the start of predominant use of bifacial arrow points. Based on
Aten’s chronology (Aten, 1971:Fig. 10; Aten et al., 1976:Fig. 16), this period approximately dates from 1850 to 1350 B.P. Shafer (1975) defined a
Woodland period for the general area of East Texas in a similar manner.
Use of the term Woodland by Shafer (1975) and Patterson (1976c) does
not have universal acceptance. Gibson et al. (1978:27) criticized Shafer
(1975) for using this term, but failed to offer a better alternate. Use of the term
Woodland in Texas is entirely consistent with the definition of the Early
Woodland period throughout the eastern U.S. As Jennings (1974:213)
points out, it is generally defined as the arbitrary termination of the Archaic
period by the introduction of pottery. There are significant regional variations
in Woodland traits, but the Early Woodland reflects little general change from
the Late Archaic (Jennings, 1974:213; Ford, 1974:399~ Shafer, 1975; McKusick, 1964:80).
Most Late Archaic dart point types seem to continue into the Woodland
period. Some dart point types, such as Gary and Kent, tend to become
smaller (Patterson, 1976c:173) similar to changes in Louisiana (Ford and
Webb, 1956). Elam type points (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:185) occur in Late
Archaic and Woodland context in Harris County (Patterson, 1977a, 1977b).
This period is somewhat later than the time range of 6,000 to 4,000 B.P.
given by McCormick (1976:44) for this type in Northcentral Texas. Wheat
(1953:Table 5) showed Elam-like points in both pre-ceramic and postceramic contexts.
Tight chronological sequences are not possible for dart point types in the
Late Archaic and Woodland due to long time periods of use of most types. A
term such as "Ceramic Archaic" could be used in place of Woodland for the
upper Texas coast. Woodland period point types are summarized in Wheat
(1953), McClurkan (1968), Shafer (1968), and Patterson (1976c).
Aten et al. (1976:Fig. 16) established a ceramic sequence for the Galveston Bay area. Early types include Goose Creek Stamped, Tchefuncte, and
Conway Plain (coarse sand tempered). Goose Creek Plain sandy paste pottery is found throughout the entire sequence. San Jacinto sherd tempered
pottery and bone tempered pottery occur in the Late Prehistoric.
The Galveston Bay ceramic sequence has limited applicability for the
entire upper Texas coast. For example, many sites in inland Harris County
have only Goose Creek Plain pottery, regardless of age (Patterson, field
notes). This situation has little diagnostic value other than indicating ceramic
occupations. On the other hand, the lack of uniformity of ceramic sequences
in inland Harris County is illustrated by Wheat (1953:184) who found sherd
tempered pottery in the upper levels of only one of eight sites. This situation
could indicate non-uniform contacts with coastal margin Indians.
Other studies of ceramic sequences were made by Aten and Bollich
(1969) and Ambler (1967) for parts of the upper Texas coast on the coastal
margin. The extreme eastern end of the upper Texas coast has a sequence of
ceramics somewhat related to Louisiana (Aten and Bollich, 1969). There are
not enough variations in ceramic types in this region to give the ordered type
of chronological sequences that were possible in Louisiana. One local difference from the Galveston Bay ceramic sequence is that inland Harris

Patterson - Upper Texas Coast

109

County sites have earlier occurrences of bone tempered pottery in the
Woodland period (Patterson, 1976c, 1977c, 1978b).
C. N. Bollich (personal communication) concurs that inland Harris
County ceramics do not always demonstrate the full Galveston Bay sequence. The inland areas may not have received as much cultural influence
from Louisiana as the coastal margin of the upper Texas coast. Mobile hunting and gathering people would not give as much importance to ceramics as
people gathering food from more localized marine resources.
Harris County inland sites lack large amounts of pottery. Incised decoration is not as important as at littoral sites within 50 to 100 mi distance. Pottery
is not very portable. The Archaic hunters and gatherers of Central Texas
started pottery use even later than on the upper Texas coast (Prewitt,
1974:Table 7).
The Allens Creek site complex (Hall, 1978, 1979, in press) is an exception to inland sites lacking the full Galveston Bay ceramic sequence. Grant
Hall (personal communication) feels that the Allens Creek ceramic sequence
is a good match for Galveston Bay and could be an indication of seasonal
rounds by coastal margin Indians. Allens Creek site 41AU37 showed a trend
of more San Jacinto sherd tempered pottery in later time, similar to the
Galveston Bay sequence. Zone 3, dated to 1044 + 68 B.P. (TX-2125), had
only a few San Jacinto sherds, while Zone 1, dated to 466 + 88 B.P. (TX2126), had an equal number of Goose Creek and San Jacinto sherds (Hall,
personal communication).
The Late Prehistoric period started some time after 1650 B.P. It is characterized by the predominant occurrence of small, bifacial arrow points, usually
weighing under 2 gm (Patterson, 1976c:Fig. 4). The predominant use of
arrow points definitely starts after the introduction of ceramics in this region
(Wheat, 1953:Fig. 23; Aten, 1971:Fig. 10). Typical arrow point types found
in this region include Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno, Catahoula, and Cliffton (Patterson, 1976c:Table 4). Other types occurring with less frequency are Alba,
Bassett, and Bonham. Some small Gary/Kent type dart points still occur
during the Late Prehistoric (Wheat, 1953:Table 5).
Prewitt (1974:Fig. 7) showed that Scallorn arrow points preceded Cliffton
and Perdiz types in Central Texas. There is no evidence that this also occurs
on the upper Texas coast. Wheat (1953:Table 5) showed Perdiz points even
earlier than Scallorn points in Harris County, a situation supported by the
early occurrence of Perdiz type points at site 41HR315 (Patterson, 1978b).
Many inland sites show less use of pottery in the Late Prehistoric than in
the Woodland period (Patterson, 1976c:Fig. 3); but this does not seem to
apply to sites on the coastal margin. Many Late Prehistoric sites do not show
much variety in material remains. The use of sherd tempering in ceramics
occurs on some sites during the Late Prehistoric. Archeological remains do
not allow a very detailed regional cultural interpretation of the Late Prehistoric
period.
Wheat (1953:Fig. 73) and Aten (1971:Fig. 10) assumed that the predominant occurrence of small projectile points demonstrated the introduction
of the bow and arrow in this region. This assumption is the usual one made
when archeological remains of bows and arrows are unavailable. However,
there is evidence that the bow and arrow started much earlier on the upper
Texas coast. The large number but limited types of small, bifacial arrow points

110

Texas Archeological Society

that predominate from the start of the Late Prehistoric indicate greater emphasis on use of the bow and arrow and use of more uniform technology.
In summary, there is evidence for human occupation of the upper Texas
coast for a period of approximately 12,000 years. Some sites show occupation sequences of 5,000 to 7,000 years, from the Early or Middle Archaic
until historic time. Some examples of long occupation sequences are site
41HR73 (Duke, 1971), site 41HR89 (McClure, 1977), site 41HR206 (Patterson, in press a), site 41HR315 (Patterson, 1978b), and the Doering site
(41HR5; Wheat, 1953).

REGIONAL STATISTICS
A review was made in late 1977 of TARL site files for this region
(Table I). While 1,641 sites were recorded, only 486 (30%) can be given
chronological classification. These statistics should be considered as approximate, as detailed data are not always recorded. Sites shown as Paleoindian
are actually Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic, with no exact occupational
data available on the earlier Clovis period. Archaic, Woodland, and Late
Prehistoric sites are also tabulated; breakdowns of single component and
multicomponent sites are given. The component totals for each time period
are probably the most significant data presented.
Not enough data are available to distinguish between various phases of
the Archaic period in most cases. Late Archaic sites are most numerous,
based on projectile point typology. Shafer (1974:7) noted large amounts of
archeological materials for the Late Archaic in East Texas. There is rapid
growth in the number of sites from the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic into
the Middle to Late Archaic. This is interpreted as a continuous trend over the
subject time interval.
The number of occupations continue to increase in the Woodland and
Late Prehistoric periods. The increase in the number of archeological sites
with time is a clear trend, not just the result of sampling bias. Late Archaic sites
are actually easier to find than Late Prehistoric ones, due to the type and large
amounts of lithic debitage on Late Archaic sites. A more intense use of the
upper Texas coast seems to be indicated as time progresses. How this affected
aboriginal lifestyles is not yet clear.
The reasons why there are a relatively large number of multicomponent
sites is not obvious. In most cases, there are few presently obvious physical
reasons for reuse of sites rather than camping at nearby locations of similar
terrain. Many multicomponent sites probably did not have successive yearly
occupations to explain site uses as an habitual pattern. One explanation for
site reuse over long time periods may be the reuse of lithic debitage, since
lithic materials are not naturally available in much of this region (Patterson, in
press b). In almost all cases, recorded sites are associated with some body of
water, even if only a small stream.
Counties with the largest number of recorded sites generally reflect a
greater amount of survey work done rather than true site densities. The variations in numbers of recorded sites for each county (Table 1) illustrates the
need for more uniform regional surveys. The large number of unclassified
sites shows the need for more thorough study and improved detail in site
reporting (Patterson, 1979b).

Of all sites recorded, 476 (29%) are shell middens. A shell midden is an
accumulation of shellfish remains. Remains of Rangia cuneata (brackish water shellfish) are most common. Some middens consist of oyster shells. There
are some middens that have both oyster and Rangia shells, reflecting changes
in water salinity at a given location. Shell midden sites are concentrated in 8
coastal margin counties (Table 2).
There are few shell midden sites recorded with evidence of pre-ceramic
occupation components. This early paucity is interpreted as reflecting increasing cultural influence from the east along the coastal margin in later time.
Shell midden sites in southern Louisiana are similar in nature and seem to
reflect the same general subsistence pattern (Patterson, field notes). As a
parallel example, Ford (1974:398) noted that shellfish did not become an
important subsistence item on the East coast until the Late Archaic. Aten et al.
(1976"Fig. 16) seemed to infer that coastal margin adaptations were not
significant before 3850 B.P.
It could be argued that early shell midden sites are now under water due to
coastal subsidence. However, this does not explain the small number of Late
Archaic coastal midden sites. Gagliano (1977:1) pointed out that the Gulf
coastline was not greatly affected by coastal subsidence from about 3,500
B.P. to modern times. Modern subsidence and coastal erosion probably have
put some shell midden sites under water in recent time. However, there is
much marshland area not subject to shoreline subsidence that does not show
much pre-ceramic use of shellfish resources.

SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS
The prehistoric occupation sequence of the upper Texas coast is characterized by a nomadic hunting and gathering lifeway which continued essentially unchanged for thousands of years (Willey, 1966:329-337; Jelks,
1978:100). This general concept appears valid but does not account for
changes in localized marine adaptations. Few detailed subsistence studies are
published and the exact nature of seasonal subsistence patterns remains unknown.
Dillehay (1975) published a detailed study of subsistence for the lower
Trinity River. Wheat (1953:Table 8) gave details of faunal remains over a
long time period in Harris County. Deer and land turtle constitute the most
numerous faunal remains on many inland sites of all ages (Patterson, field
notes). Other animals typically available were rabbit, squirrel, racoon, opossum, wolf, and bear. Wheat (1953:Table 8) showed some use of buffalo; but
availability was subject to herd migrations and use was not continuous.
Inland sites do not show much use of freshwater shellfish (Wheat,
1953:237), although this resource presently exists near many known sites.
Large amounts of waterfowl are seasonably available. While plant foods were
probably important, remains are generally unavailable. Plant food processing
can be inferred from a few metates in Late Archaic/Woodland context on
inland Harris County sites, such as 41HR315 (Patterson, 1978b:3).
Marine adapted sites in the littoral and marsh areas present a contrast to
the inland coastal plain generalized hunting and gathering pattern. The most
frequent marine adapted site is the Rangia shell midden; oysters were used at

Patterson - Upper Texas Coast

113

some locations (Dillehay, 1975). A number of published reports are available
for marine adapted sites in this region (Aten, 1971; O’Brien, 1971; Ambler,
1967; Gilmore, 1974; Shafer, 1966).
Many shell middens are quite large and represent a significant use of
shellfish as a food source over long time periods. Some shell middens are
large enough to use NASA satellite photographs to identify this type of site in
Terrebonne Parrish in south Louisiana, with later verification by surface survey (Patterson, field notes). NASA photograph enlargements produce sharp
ground details.
Aten (1971) showed evidence (projectile points, deer bones, and a barb
of a compound fishhook) of hunting and fishing activities on a shell midden
site in Brazoria County. Deer bones seem to be frequently found on shell
midden sites given in unpublished TARL site records.
Dillehay (1975:30) identified fish and alligator as heavily used food
sources on shell middens in the lower Trinity River delta. The total number of
types of faunal remains was quite extensive (Dillehay, 1975:Appendix 4).
Both Rangia and oysters were present as shellfish food sources. Thus, many
shell midden sites seem to be characterized as having principally marine
adapted subsistence patterns with some hunting activities present.
It has not been accurately determined to what extent Indians using coastal
shell midden sites also seasonally used other inland sites. The accounts of
Cabeza de Vaca (Covey, 1961) indicated that at least some Indians did not
spend the entire year at coastal margin sites. Coastal margin sites in this region
tend to have much more pottery and fewer lithics compared to inland sites
(Patterson, 1976c: 171). The presence of large amounts of pottery at some
coastal margin sites could possibly indicate fairly long occupation periods,
although not necessarily a completely sedentary existence.
A more mobile life style may have occurred during the Late Prehistoric at
inland locations in this region. In a study of a 10 sq mi area in inland Harris
County (Patterson, 1976c), it was noted that sites became smaller and more
frequent in the Late Prehistoric. The decreased use of pottery in the Late
Prehistoric also supports the concept of a more mobile lifestyle.
Two contrasting theories may be examined to explain a trend to a more
mobile lifeway, both connected to subsistence patterns. Cohen (1977:83)
proposed that people may settle down to agriculture or become more mobile
to obtain food when population pressures increase. Agriculture may not have
been a viable subsistence option for the upper Texas coast (O’Brien and
Spencer, 1976). On the other hand, Dillehay (personal communication) offered the explanation that as people live longer in a given area, they may learn
to schedule utilization of natural food resources more efficiently and adopt a
more mobile lifeway to take advantage of this experience.
The study of subsistence activities on archeological sites is limited by the
poor preservation of wood, fiber, bone, skin, and shell materials. Remains of
shelters and wood tools at campsites are unavailable. Bone and antler tools
and projectile points were found at a number of sites at both inland (Wheat,
1953) and coastal margin (Aten, 1971) locations. Bone and antler tools could
have been used as awls, flaking tools, and crude knives.
Even though types of material remains are limited, some types of subsistence activities can be inferred from archeological collections. Hunting activities are shown by the occurrence of many projectile points. Lithic toolmaking

and/or repair is almost universal at all campsites of all ages, as evidenced by
the debitage found. There is also widespread evidence of heat treating of flint
to improve knapping quality. This pretreatment would have been a necessity
for tough alluvial cherts from the nearest lithic sources (Patterson, 1979c).
Indians of this region did not produce many bifacial tools other than projectile points. Shafer (1974) noted that the generalized flake tool was important throughout East Texas. Wear patterns on utilized flakes (Tringham et al.,
1974) for cutting and scraping functions are common. Butchery, hide preparation, and woodworking activities can be inferred. Some sandstone abrading
tools are also found.
Remains of fire hearths, mainly of baked earth and clay, are found at
some campsites (Patterson, 1978b, in press a). Fired clay balls are common in
the Late Archaic and Woodland periods (Aten, 1967:39; Ambler,
1967:Table 3; Shafer, 1968:74; Patterson, 1976c: 183) and imply some type
of cooking activities (Gibson, 1975).

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES
Although a rather uniform lifeway seems to have persisted, some technological changes occurred, such as changes in projectile point types and lithic
procurement patterns, increasing use of the bow and arrow in later time, and
introduction of ceramics. These changes did not seem to alter basic life styles
for the hunters and gatherers of East Texas (Shafer, 1974). Intense use of
pottery on coastal margin sites probably indicates changes in subsistence activities.
Many technological traits were stable over long time periods (Patterson,
1976c:183). Some of these traits include use of bone tools, flake gravers,
notched tools, small prismatic blades, generalized flake tools, and heat treating of chert. For any given time period, the quality of lithic craftmanship was
highly variable. While examples are present, bifacial tools other than projectile points do not seem to be an important item during any time period.
Lithic resources are generally scarce on the upper Texas coast and some
changes in lithic procurement patterns appear to have developed over time
(Patterson, in press b). These changes include a more selective choice of raw
material sizes brought to campsites and possibly more reuse of debitage at
campsites from previous occupations. As projectile points became smaller in
later time, it would have become easier to find suitable lithic raw materials
from the large flakes left from previous occupations. Also, practically no large
chert pieces were imported to campsites in late occupation periods.
There is evidence (Patterson, 1973a, 1976c), including formal excavation
in Harris County (Patterson, 1978b), to indicate use of the bow and arrow on
the upper Texas coast earlier than usually accepted and a long period of
concurrent use of the atlatl. Small Gary/Kent type points, weighing 2 to 3
gm, may be transitional arrow points, adapted from dart point morphology
(Patterson, 1973b, 1976c). These types are found in Harris County (Patterson, 1978b) at least as early as the start of ceramics (1850 B.P.), compared to
the later start of the general occurrence of bifacial arrow points (approximately 1350 B.P.).

116

Texas Archeological Society

Small unifacial points of the type described by Patterson and Sollberger
(1974) are found (Patterson, 1973a, 1976c, 1978, in press a) as early as the
Late Archaic. These unifacial points generally weigh about 1 gm and are
shaped by shallow marginal retouch.
Dates for the earliest use of the bow and arrow in other parts of Texas also
seem to be becoming earlier. Hughes (1978:187) gave an early radiocarbon
date of 1830 + 60 B.P. (SI-1900) for small bifacial arrow points in the Texas
Panhandle. He also pointed out (personal communication) that this full developed technology must have started even earlier. This technology perhaps
corresponds to early use of the bow and arrow in the Great Basin. Dates are as
early as 3200 + 140 B.P. (GaK1564) at Hogup Cave (Aiken, 1970:184)
and 2630 + 110 B.P. (RL-109) at Swallow Shelter (Dalley, 1977:71).
Another indication of possible early use of the bow and arrow is the early
presence of a fully developed microblade industry. This presence may indicate concurrent diffusion of small blade technology and the bow and arrow
from the far north (Patterson, 1973a). It is not likely that a definite microblade
industry occurs for casual reasonst The Indians would have made microblades for specific uses. Retouched microblades indicate use as single and
compound elements of arrow points.
While the use of the bow and arrow became predominant in the Late
Prehistoric, the atlatl was not totally replaced. Wheat (1953:Table 5) showed
the occurrence of dart points throughout the Late Prehistoric. Hudson
(1976: 76,116) noted some use of the spear thrower into historic times along
the Gulf coast. As a parallel example, Cressman (1977:106) noted that the
atlatl was not suddenly replaced by the bow and arrow in the Great Basin.

NON-UTILITARIAN ASPECTS
Few details are available on the non-utilitarian aspects of prehistoric lifeways in this region. Nomadic peoples do not leave many sophisticated
cultural remains. Also, many decorative and ceremonial items probably were
made from perishable materials such as wood, shell, and bone. Campsites of
all ages have particularly few non-utilitarian cultural remains. Information
comes mainly from the few known mortuary sites.
Occasionally, campsites in Harris County yielded a few bone pendants
and beads (McClure, 1978:Fig. 30) and drilled stone pendants (Patterson, in
press a). Red ochre is fairly common at Harris County campsites of Late
Archaic and Early Woodland ages (Patterson, 1978b:3). Wheat (1953:Table
6) noted the occurrence of paint pigments over a wide time range. The occurrence of small smooth pebbles is almost universal on campsites of all ages in
Harris County (Patterson, field notes). These may have been used in gourd
and turtle shell rattles (Aten et al., 1976:41).
Mortuary sites in this region show that the Indian’s life did have some
ceremonial and recreational aspects beyond the level of bare subsistence activities. The most detailed publication of a mortuary site is by Aten et al.
(1976) for mainly Woodland period burials in Harris County. Non-utilitarian
grave goods include bone dice, birdbone flutes, incised bone, shell and bone
beads, and a shell pendant.
The Late Prehistoric Jamaica Beach site on Galveston Island (Aten et al.,
1976:75) had burials with bone beads, a drilled canine tooth pendant, and an

Patterson -- Upper Texas Coast

117

incised bone pendant. Current work at Mitchell Ridge site 41GV66 on
Galveston Island yielded many Late Prehistoric burials but few grave goods
(Bruce, ms.). The Shell Point site in Brazoria County (Hole and Wilkinson,
1973) yielded shell beads and a shell pendant in Late Prehistoric burials.
Hall (in press) presents details of a large mortuary complex in Austin
County. Although there were burials from Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric,
most non-utilitarian grave goods were associated with the Late Archaic. items
included were a ground stone gorget, large ceremonial corner tanged knives,
shell pendants, shell beads, stingray spines, jasper pebbles, and ground stone
boatstones.
The small physical size of most archeological sites in this region infers that
the usual social structure was one or more extended families operating as
roving bands. Little class distinction can be inferred from the burials. Site
41AU36 (Hall, 1978, 1979, in press) gave evidence of violent conflict in the
Late Archaic, with several individuals killed by dart points.
Although ethnographic accounts of this region sometimes mention the
possibility of cannabalism, there is little prehistoric evidence for this practice.
Some human teeth were found mixed with deer teeth and bones on site
41HR244 in Harris County (Patterson, 1979d). This occurrence might indicate cannabalism. However, as this is a rare find, cannabalism, if practiced at
all, was not a frequent occurrence.

EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS
While a conservative hunting and gathering lifeway persisted on the upper Texas coast throughout prehistory, outside influences are detectable.
Evidence of outside influences probably reflects the contact possibilities of a
wide ranging nomadic lifeway. The projectile point types of the Paleoindian
and Early Archaic periods are part of a wide distribution throughout North
America (Wormington, 1957).
Middle Archaic dart point types in this region are found in adjacent areas
to the north (Smith, 1969; McCormick, 1976), east (Gagliano, 1967), and
Edwards Plateau (Prewitt, 1974). The Late Archaic projectile points are
characteristic of adjacent regions (Suhm and Jelks, 1962).
Patterson (1975) noted that most point types that occur in the Late Archaic in Louisiana are also found on the upper Texas coast. The Ponchartrain
dart point is especially characteristic of Louisiana and occurs in this region
(Patterson, 1978b; McClurkan, 1968). Ellis and Gary/Kent point types
found on the upper Texas coast have wide distributions in other parts of
eastern North America (Suhm and Jelks, 1962).
In the Late Prehistoric period, arrow points found in this region have wide
distributions in East (Shafer, 1974) and Central (Prewitt, 1974) Texas.The
Catahoula arrow point (Patterson, 1976d) has wide distribution to the northeast of this region. Toyah arrow points found in Harris County (Patterson,
1976c) show possible Late Prehistoric contact with the southwest, possibly
through the so-called Gilmore Corridor (Kreiger, 1948).
Edwards Plateau chert (Georgetown and Belton Lake) is fairly common
at sites in this region (Patterson, in press b). Hall (1978, 1979, in press) felt
that the large corner tanged knives found in Austin County came from the

118

Texas Archeological Society

Edwards Plateau and that ground stone objects were from the Ouachita
Mountains in Arkansas.
Bone tempered pottery found as early as the Woodland period on the
upper Texas coast may show Caddoan influences (Dee Ann Story, personal
communication) from the north. Shafer (1968) and McClurkan (1968) found
some Caddoan pottery types from sites on the northern edge of this region.
Caddoan influences over the entire region, however, do not appear to be
strong.
The strongest influence on ceramic types of the upper Texas coast appears to be from Louisiana. There are a few examples of the early Tchefuncte
type~(Aten et al., 1976) and many examples of later Coles Creek incised
designs (Aten and Bollich, 1969). While ceramics were probably introduced
from Louisiana, the main pottery style in this region is the local Goose Creek
Plain with sandy paste.
Pottery found on the upper Texas coast is generally not well made° It
probably illustrates the transmission of a general idea rather than specific
manufacturing techniques that produced the well made pottery types of Louisiana~ Rockport type pottery from the central Texas coast is found occasionally (Shafer, 1968:Fig. 34).
The use of small prismatic blade technology seems to start sometime in
the last half of the Archaic and was widespread along the entire Gulf coast
(Patterson, 1973a). This technology may be ultimately derived from the far
north. Prismatic blade technologies are widely distributed in Texas (Patterson, 1974b).

SUMMARY
Presently available evidence shows that there probably has been at least
12,000 years of prehistoric occupation on the upper Texas coast. A conservative hunting and gathering lifeway continued throughout the prehistoric
period, with technological changes having little effect on the basic pattern.
Detectable external influences do not seem to have had much effect on lifestyle.
This region is no longer archeologically unknown. An extensive literature
has evolved recently (Patterson, 1979a) and many archeological sites are
recorded for each county. There is a need for more extensive survey of the
entire region on a more uniform basis. Not all counties are equally well
known.
Detailed syntheses of subsistence and settlement patterns remain as future research goals. Seasonal patterns have not yet received much study. The
possible relationships of coastal margin and inland sites is not well understood. More data are especially needed to obtain a better picture of the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods.
Urbanization of the upper Texas coast is rapidly destroying many archeological resources, but little public funding has been provided for mitigation. The upper Texas coast also lacks a good regional museum for the proper
preservation of prehistoric information. Little is being done to put research
information into the public domain from current contract archeology for environmental impact work.
