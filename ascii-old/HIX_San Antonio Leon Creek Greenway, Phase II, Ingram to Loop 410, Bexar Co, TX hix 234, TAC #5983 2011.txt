ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100‐percent intensive linear survey of the
proposed City of San Antonio’s Leon Creek Greenway Development Project, Phase II, Ingram
Road to Loop 410 in Bexar County, Texas. The City of San Antonio is proposing a hike and bike
roadway on the north bank of the creek. Hicks & Company was contracted by Terra Design
Group, Inc., to conduct the cultural resource investigations on behalf of the City of San Antonio
in pursuit of compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Investigations were coordinated with the Texas
Historical Commission under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No. 5983. The proposed
project area is located near the confluence of Leon and Huebner Creeks, extending south from
Ingram Road to Loop 410. The proposed project area extends 1.25 miles, the majority of which
has been previously surveyed. The current investigations included the portions of the proposed
project area that had not been previously surveyed, which consisted of 275 meters (0.17 miles)
immediately south of Ingram Road. Archeologists did not record any prehistoric or historic
archeological sites during the current investigations. The majority of the survey area has been
extensively disturbed by gravel mining, landfill operations, and modern dumping; therefore, the
potential for the proposed alignment to contain intact archeological deposits is very low. It is
Hicks & Company’s recommendation that construction should be allowed to proceed with no
further cultural resource investigations necessary. No artifacts were collected during the
current investigations and no archeological sites were recorded; therefore, all project‐related
forms, documents, and photographs will be permanently curated at Hicks & Company in Austin,
Texas.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On August, 5, 2011, investigators at Hicks & Company conducted an intensive linear
archeological survey for the City of San Antonio’s Leon Creek Greenway Development Project,
Phase II, Ingram Road to Loop 410 in Bexar County, Texas. Hicks & Company has been
contracted by Terra Design Group, Inc., to conduct the cultural investigations for proposed hike
and bike roadway. The proposed project area extends 1.25 miles within the Leon Creek
Greenway Corridor, beginning at Ingram Road and extending south to the intersection of Loop
410 with Leon Creek (Figures 1 and 2: Appendix A). The proposed roadway will be in
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and will therefore have an improved
surface approximately ten feet wide with an additional one‐foot shoulder on each side. The
area directly northwest of the proposed alignment is currently undergoing overpass
construction, resulting in extensive disturbance to the northern portion of the survey area. The
rest of the proposed alignment has undergone significant disturbance as a result of previous
gravel mining and landfill operations, and has also been subjected to unauthorized dumping
and associated disturbance. The proposed project area is located on lands to be owned and
controlled by the City of San Antonio and is therefore subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). Also, the proposed project will be permitted under a Federal Nationwide Permit 14
through the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE), requiring compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The current archeological
investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 5983,
issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on June 30, 2011 (Appendix B).
Background research for the project was conducted using the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas
and records available at the THC library. Results of background research indicate that there are
four previously recorded archeological sites (Sites 41BX556 and 41BX1534–1536) within one
kilometer of the proposed project area. Summary information for these sites is included in the
THC coordination letter (letter, Champion to Wolfe [Appendix B]). None of these sites overlap
the proposed project area. Three sites (Sites 41BX1534–1536) were recorded during survey
investigations for the Culebra/Loop 410 (Leon Creek) Regional Stormwater Detention Facility in
2002. Site 41BX1534 is a prehistoric campsite and historic (1930s–1950s) industrial site, while
Sites 41BX1535 and 41BX1536 are prehistoric lithic scatters. The remaining site, Site 41BX556,
was recorded by the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (presently the
Texas Department of Transportation [TxDOT]) in 1981 and is also a prehistoric lithic scatter.
A total of 11 surveys were previously conducted within one kilometer of the proposed project
area. Six of these were linear surveys, four of which were performed by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). One of these surveys, conducted in 1985, abuts the proposed project
area to the north and extends along the south side of Farm‐to‐Market (FM) 3487.
Approximately 50 meters from the proposed project area, the north side of FM 3487 was
surveyed in 1986 by FHWA on the west side of Loop 410. The following year, an FHWA survey
was performed for FM 1957, approximately 75 meters west of the proposed project area. In
1994, a survey along the south side of FM 3487 east of Loop 410 was conducted approximately

Introduction and Management Summary

380 meters from the proposed project area. Finally, the Texas Department of Highway and
Public Transportation (TxDOT) performed two linear surveys along Loop 410 in 1977.
Five areal archeological surveys were conducted within one kilometer of the proposed project
area. In 2004, SWCA conducted a survey on behalf of San Antonio Water Systems along the
majority of the proposed project alignment. This survey extends south and crosses another
survey performed by SWCA along Ingram Road in 2009, and then continues further south to
cross Loop 410, where it overlaps with a survey conducted just south of the proposed project
area by PBS&J in 2002 on behalf of the City of San Antonio. At the northern terminus of the
proposed alignment, a survey was conducted by SWCA in 2009 on behalf of Bexar County Flood
Control. Also, a reconnaissance survey was conducted along Loop 410 by the University of
Texas at San Antonio on behalf of TxDOT in 2005, which coincides with the south boundary of
the proposed alignment. Finally, a survey was performed just northeast of the proposed
project area by Hicks & Company on behalf of the City of San Antonio in 2008 in preparation for
Phase I of the Leon Creek Greenway Development Project.
On August 5, 2011, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive linear
archeological survey of the previously unsurveyed portion of the proposed alignment,
extending 275 meters south of Ingram Road. A total of two shovel tests were conducted during
the survey, one of which was positive for cultural materials. This positive shovel test was
excavated just northeast of Leon Creek and contained four pieces of historic glass of an
unknown age to a maximum depth of 30 centimeters. No other cultural resources were
identified within the current survey area. Shovel tests were limited during the survey due to the
amount of exposed limestone bedrock throughout the proposed alignment, especially in the
immediate vicinity of Leon Creek. On October 14, 2011, the THC concurred with Hicks &
Company’s recommendation that no significant sites are located within the project area and
that the proposed project should be allowed to proceed (letter, Champion to Wolfe
[Appendix B]).
John Fulmer served as the Principal Investigator for the project, while Samantha Walden
Champion served as the Project Archeologist. John Fulmer and Samantha Walden Champion
conducted the archeological investigations, and Samantha Walden Champion authored the
report. Jerod McCleland conducted the Geographic Information System (GIS) data processing
and produced the maps. Cheryl Hardy and Melita McAtee aided in the formatting of the report
and report production. No artifacts were collected as a result of this investigation, and all
project‐related documents, forms, and photographs will be curated at Hicks & Company. This
report serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of TAC Permit No. 5983.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
The proposed project is composed of entirely new hike and bike roadway to be constructed in
an area mapped as containing Holocene‐age deposits; however, the majority of the proposed
project area has been previously surveyed by SWCA in preparation for placement of a
stormwater line within Leon Creek. The portion of the proposed project area that has not been
previously surveyed spans approximately 275 meters (0.17 miles) from the SWCA survey area
north to a previously surveyed portion of Ingram Road (Figures 1 and 2: Appendix A). This
unsurveyed portion of the proposed project area was investigated through intensive pedestrian
survey supplemented by shovel testing. Shovel tests were excavated in the few portions of the
survey area where soils were present. The content of each shovel test was screened through
quarter‐inch hardware mesh and returned to the shovel test location upon completion. Results
of shovel testing were recorded through standardized forms, notes, and photographs. The
previously unsurveyed portion of the proposed alignment crosses areas that have been heavily
disturbed by the flow of Leon Creek, as seen on the aerial photo of the proposed project area
(Figure 2: Appendix A). In these areas of exposed bedrock, investigations consisted of
pedestrian survey alone. Though the proposed hike and bike roadway will cross Leon Creek just
north of its fork at Huebner Creek, no bridge locations are proposed for this project; instead, a
low‐water crossing will be utilized. Since the area has been extensively surveyed and depths of
impacts are not expected to exceed one meter, backhoe trenching was not necessary for
investigation of the proposed project area. All observations and results of the current
investigations were recorded through notes, standardized forms, and photographs, and all
shovel test locations were recorded using a sub‐meter GPS.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations were conducted on August 5, 2011, during which archeologists walked the extent
of the previously unsurveyed portion of the proposed alignment. Though the entirety of the
proposed project area measures approximately 1.25 miles in length, the majority of this area
has been previously surveyed, with the exception of the northernmost extent of the proposed
alignment. This survey area consisted of a total of 275 meters (0.17 miles), extending from
Ingram Road south to where the alignment crosses Leon Creek. The proposed project area is
located approximately 100 meters northwest of the confluence of Leon and Huebner Creeks,
which were dry at the time of survey (Figure 3). Extensive disturbance was noted during the
investigations, including a maintenance/construction road paralleling the northern quarter of
the survey area, overpass construction in the vicinity, gravel mining, and landfill operations,
evidenced by at least eight pushpiles throughout the survey area. The proposed project area
has also undergone unauthorized dumping of modern trash.

Figure 3: Exposed bedrock in the dry creekbed of Leon Creek near its
confluence with Huebner Creek, facing south.
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, the proposed project area is located along the
Balcones Fault Zone, which separates the Edwards Plateau to the northwest and the Gulf of
Mexico Basin to the southeast (Barnes 1983). Soils within the previously unsurveyed portion of
the alignment are mapped, from north to south, as Patrick soils (Pab), Tinn and Frio soils (Tf),
and Pits and Quarries (Pt) (USDA/NRCS 2011). Patrick Soils typically contain clay loam on top of
very gravelly sand, while Tinn and Frio soils contain silty clay loam on top of clay loam, both of
which extend to an approximate depth of 80 inches before terminating at limestone bedrock.

Results of Field Investigations

Pits and Quarries composes the majority of the survey area, positioned north of where the
alignment crosses Leon Creek. These Pits and Quarries are associated with twentieth century
quarrying activities, particularly extensive gravel mining conducted in the area during the 1970s
(Taylor et al. 1991).
Vegetation observed during the survey consists of patchy grasses, thorny scrub, cacti, and
dispersed cedar and hardwoods (Figure 4), particularly north of where the alignment crosses
Leon Creek. Surface visibility during the investigations ranged from 20 to 100 percent
depending on location, with portions of the survey area exhibiting fully exposed limestone
bedrock. These areas were investigated through a means of pedestrian survey alone. North‐
northeast of Leon Creek, soils were relatively shallow where present, with shovel tests
terminating at a maximum depth of approximately 30 centimeters below the ground surface.

Figure 4: Hardwoods and scrub within survey area, with large cement
slabs and modern trash, facing east‐northeast.
The southernmost portion of the survey area is located within the exposed limestone bed of
Leon Creek, which was dry at the time of the investigations. North‐northeast of the creek, the
proposed alignment crosses grassland gently sloping northward toward Ingram Road that has
been utilized during gravel mining and landfill operations, evidenced by the backhoe pushpiles
scattered along the alignment. The northernmost ten meters of the proposed alignment cross
through stands of medium‐sized hardwoods and brush, immediately west of which an overpass
is currently being constructed. Also, a maintenance/construction road extends along the
northern quarter of the survey area (Figure 5). Modern trash including large cement slabs,
mattresses, and corroded metal cans are scattered throughout the alignment north of its
crossing at Leon Creek, indicating the area has been and is still likely used as a dumping ground.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 5: Maintenance/construction road and overpass construction

Two shovel tests were excavated during the investigations (Shovel Tests JF1–2), one of which
was positive for cultural materials (Table 1). Shovel Test JF1 was placed approximately 10
meters north‐northeast of Leon Creek. Deposits consisted of pale brown sand with small
gravels increasing in density toward termination (Figure 6). Four pieces of historic‐aged glass
were present between 10 and 20 cmbs, three of which were clear and one of which was dark
brown (Figure 7). Shovel Test JF1 terminated at 30 cmbs at fragmented bedrock. Shovel Test
JF2 was conducted approximately 30 meters north‐northeast of Shovel Test JF1 and consisted
of the same pale brown sand with heavy gravels, terminating at five cmbs at fragmented
bedrock. Due to the level of disturbance within the area along with high surface visibility, no
other shovel tests were conducted during the current investigations.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No archeological sites were recorded during the investigation of the 275 meters of the
previously unsurveyed portion of the proposed alignment. Beyond four pieces of historic glass
and modern trash, no cultural materials were encountered during the investigation, which
included 100‐percent intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by shovel testing. The
proposed project alignment is located in an area that has undergone significant disturbance as
a result of gravel mining, landfill operations, and unauthorized dumping. The majority of the
survey area has been extensively modified, evidenced by approximately eight pushpiles
throughout the 275 meters surveyed. Furthermore, the southern one‐third of the survey area
is comprised of the exposed limestone bed of Leon Creek, with no soils present. Overall, the
potential for the survey area to contain intact archeological deposits is very low.
Based on the results of the current investigations, no further work is recommended for the
proposed project area, and construction should be allowed to proceed. In the event that
unrecorded cultural deposits are encountered during construction, all ground‐disturbing
activities should cease pending notification and comment from the THC relative to the
Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC
Permit No. 5983. Since no artifacts were collected during survey and no archeological sites
were recorded, all project‐related forms, documents, and photographs will be permanently
curated at Hicks & Company in Austin, Texas.

RE: Antiquities Code of Texas Coordination for the City of San Antonio Leon
Creek Greenway Development Project, Phase II, Ingram Road to Loop 410
Dear Mr. Wolfe,
The City of San Antonio is proposing to construct a hike and bike roadway
approximately 1.25 miles long within the Leon Creek Greenway Corridor from Ingram
Road to Loop 410 in Bexar County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed roadway will
be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and will therefore
have an improved surface approximately ten feet wide with an additional one-foot
shoulder on each side. The proposed project is identified as Phase II of the City of San
Antonio Leon Creek Greenway Development Project. Hicks & Company is contracted to
conduct the cultural resource investigations on behalf of Terra Design Group.
Since the proposed project is planned for construction on lands to be owned or controlled
by the State of Texas, compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas is required.
Pending forthcoming engineering data, the proposed project will also likely require
permitting under a federal Nationwide Permit (NWP) through the U.S. Army Corp of
Engineers. In this case, the proposed project will be required to comply with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
Background research for this project was conducted using the Archeological Sites Atlas
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and records available at the THC
library. According to available data, there are no Official State Historical Markers
(OSHMs) located within the project area, nor are there any State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs), cemeteries, or sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). As the proposed hike and bike roadway is currently configured, there are four
previously recorded archeological sites (Sites 41BX556 and 41BX1534–1536) within one
kilometer of the proposed project area. The locations of these sites are provided on a
topographic map (Figure 1) and summarized in Table 1.

Site 41BX556 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located approximately 100 meters east of the
southern portion of the proposed project area and extends approximately 480 meters
along Loop 410. Site 41BX1534, an open campsite and abandoned historic industrial site,
is located 330 meters southeast of the proposed project area. The other sites within one
kilometer of the proposed project area, Sites 41BX1535 and 41BX1536, are prehistoric
lithic scatters approximately 455 meters and 445 meters from the proposed project area,
respectively. The aforementioned sites will not be affected by the construction of the
proposed segment of the Leon Creek Greenway, and there are no sites directly adjacent to
or along the proposed hike and bike roadway; therefore, no further discussion of these
sites is warranted.
Eleven previously conducted surveys are recorded within one kilometer of the proposed
project area (Figure 1). Six of these were linear surveys, four of which were performed
by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). One of these surveys, conducted in
1985, abuts the proposed project area to the north and extends along the south side of
Farm-to-Market (FM) 3487. Approximately 50 meters from the proposed project area,
the north side of FM 3487 was surveyed in 1986 on the west side of Loop 410. In 1987, a
survey was conducted for FM 1957 approximately 75 meters west of the proposed project
area, and in 1994, a survey along the south side of FM 3487 east of Loop 410 was
conducted approximately 380 meters from the proposed hike and bike roadway. Finally,
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (formerly the Texas Department of
Highway and Public Transportation [TDHPT]) performed two surveys along Loop 410 in
1977.
In addition to the linear archeological surveys conducted in the area, a total of five areal
archeological surveys were performed within one kilometer of the proposed hike and bike

roadway. In 2004, SWCA conducted a survey on behalf of San Antonio Water Systems
(SAWS) along the majority of the proposed project alignment. This survey extends south
and crosses another survey performed by SWCA along Ingram Road in 2009, and then
continues further south to cross Loop 410, where it overlaps with a survey conducted just
south of the proposed project area by PBS&J on behalf of the City of San Antonio in
2002. At the northern terminus of the proposed alignment, a survey was conducted by
SWCA on behalf of Bexar County Flood Control in 2009. Also, a reconnaissance survey
was conducted along Loop 410 by the University of Texas at San Antonio on behalf of
TxDOT in 2005, which bounds the proposed alignment to the south. Finally, a survey
was performed just northeast of the proposed project area by Hicks & Company on behalf
of the City of San Antonio in 2008 in preparation for Phase I of the Leon Creek
Greenway Development Project.
The proposed project area is located in Bexar County in south Central Texas at the edge
of the Balcones Escarpment and is shown on the Helotes and Culebra Hill 7.5-minute
USGS Quadrangles. The Balcones Fault Zone separates relatively horizontal strata of the
Edwards Plateau toward the northwest from the more steeply dipping strata of the Gulf of
Mexico Basin toward the southeast (Barnes 1983). According to the Geologic Atlas of
Texas–Austin Sheet, the surface geology within the project area is primarily Early
Holocene-age fluviatile deposits consisting of gravel, sand, silt, and clay.
Approximately 45 percent of the proposed project area has been mapped as Tinn and Frio
soils, zero to one percent slopes, frequently flooded (Tf). These soils are described as
variably clayey or loamy alluvium of Holocene age derived from mixed sources that form
terraces located adjacent to and within floodplains. On average, depths can typically
exceed 200 centimeters (80 inches) before either the water table or bedrock geology is
encountered. In addition to Tinn and Frio soils, the project area traverses areas mapped
as Pits and Quarries (Pt) (Taylor et al. 1991). These pit and quarry areas are mapped over
approximately 55 percent of the proposed alignment and are associated with twentieth
century quarrying activities, particularly extensive gravel mining conducted in the area
during the 1970s.
The proposed project is composed of entirely new hike and bike roadway to be
constructed in an area containing Holocene-age deposits; however, the majority of the
proposed project area has been previously surveyed by SWCA in preparation for
placement of a stormwater line within Leon Creek (Carpenter 2005). The portion of the
proposed project area that has not been previously surveyed spans approximately 275
meters (0.17 miles) from the SWCA survey area north to a previously surveyed portion
of Ingram Road. Hicks & Company recommends that this unsurveyed portion of the
proposed project area be investigated through intensive pedestrian survey supplemented
by shovel testing. The unsurveyed portion of the proposed alignment crosses areas that
have been heavily disturbed by the flow of Leon Creek, as seen on the aerial photo of the
project area (Figure 2). In these areas of exposed bedrock, investigations will likely
consist of pedestrian survey alone. Though the proposed hike and bike roadway will cross
Leon Creek just north of its fork from Huebner Creek, no bridge locations are proposed
for this project; instead, a low-water crossing will be utilized. Since the area has been

extensively surveyed and depths of impacts are not expected to exceed one meter,
backhoe trenching is not recommended for investigation of the proposed project area.
Attached to this letter is a topographic map of the proposed alignment including
previously recorded archeological sites and surveys (Figure 1) along with an aerial photo
of the project area (Figure 2). This letter represents formal City of San Antonio
coordination with the THC to determine obligations for the proposed project under ACT
regulations. Additionally, pending forthcoming engineering data, it is anticipated that the
proposed project will require Section 106 coordination under an NWP. Please offer your
comments relative to any City of San Antonio responsibility for achieving ACT and
Section 106 compliance in order for construction to proceed. If you have any questions or
require any additional information, please contact me at (512) 478-0858.
Sincerely,

Samantha Walden Champion
Staff Archeologist & Asst. Project Manager
