ABSTRACT
The City of Tyler is proposing to construct the Towne Park Drive/Lake
Placid Road street project, which consists of 3900’ of new road and the
widening of 2600’ of existing road along the route on the southwest side
of Tyler in Smith County, Texas. The final roadway will be a 115’ wide
right-of-way (ROW) for the full length of the 6500’ long route. Towne
Park Drive will be extended southeast to the Frankston Hwy (SH 155) and
then the route will turn northeast toward Lake Placid Road and terminate
at Old Jacksonville Hwy (FM 2943). Once the route reaches Lake Placid
Rd, it will be widened by 55 to 65’ on the north side of the existing road.
The city contracted with Johnson & Pace, Inc. for the engineering and
environmental permitting. Johnson & Pace contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed route and to determine if any cultural resources
were present, and to make recommendations about their significance.
ARC conducted the survey in February of 2011, and excavated 53 shovel
tests along the route. No prehistoric archaeological sites were identified,
but seven historic sites were recorded. Six of the sites (41SM433, 434,
435, 436, 437, and 439) were associated with mapped 20th century
structures that were demolished prior to the survey. None of the sites had
any standing structures and all consisted of artifact scatters of glass,
concrete, limited features, and other building material debris. The seventh
site, 41SM438, represents the remains of the Saint Louis Southwestern
Railroad berm where it crossed Lake Placid Rd. The tracks have been
removed, but a small culvert is still at the crossing. Given the poor
integrity of the sites, lack of standing structures, and no known association
with persons of significance, none of the sites are considered eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Based on the results of
the survey, ARC recommends that the project should be allowed to
proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Tyler is proposing to construct the Towne Park Drive/Lake Placid Road street
project, which will consist of constructing 3900’ of new road and the widening of 2600’ of
existing road along the route on the southwest side of Tyler in Smith County, Texas (Figure 1).
The 6500’project route will be funded 100 percent by the city and there is no federal funding or
involvement with TxDOT or FHWA. The route consists of approximately 3900’ of new right-ofway (ROW) from Towne Park Drive (Dr) southeast to SH 155 and then northeast towards the
intersection of Old Noonday Road (Rd) and Lake Placid Rd. The route will then follow Lake
Placid Rd for 2600’ to its eastern terminus at the intersection with Old Jacksonville Hwy (FM
2943). Once the route reaches Lake Placid Rd, it will be widened by 55 to 65’ on the north side
of the existing road (Figure 2). The south side of Lake Placid Rd will not be impacted by
construction nor will any new ROW be acquired. The project will consist of a 115’ wide ROW.
The city has contracted with Johnson & Pace, Inc. for the engineering and environmental
permitting. Johnson & Pace has contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed route.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials older than 50
years are present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and how they will
be impacted by construction. The cultural resource investigation was conducted during February
of 2011 and was required because the City of Tyler is a political entity of the State of Texas.
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5842 was issued for the survey. Relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation
Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended PL-92-500 and the
Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the
project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of Northeast Texas. A chapter on the
research design and methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of
the field investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references
cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Smith County is located in northeastern Texas and covers approximately 932 square miles
(McCrosky 2011). The study area is located in the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest plant
community, which is part of the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and
Orzell 1987: Figure 1) and is part of the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950: Figure 1).
Two-thirds of the county is covered in post oak, blackjack oak and tall grasses while the
remaining third is heavily forested with pine and hardwoods. Major timber trees are pine, oak,
hickory, cedar elm, and sweet gum. Other hardwood associations are found in low, wet
bottomlands. Understory vegetation includes green briar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, wild grape,
crape myrtle, dogwood, and many other species. Soils vary from sandy prairie loams in the
northwestern and eastern parts of the county to loam-covered clays in the remainder. Elevations
in the county range from 300 to 600 feet above mean sea level. The climate is warm and moist
with an annual rainfall that averages 44 inches and with temperatures that range from an average
low of 33 degrees in January to an average high of 95 degrees in July. No more than 10 percent
of the county is prime farmland (McCrosky 2011).
The underlying geology of the study area consists of the Sparta City Sand and veins of the Tyler
Greensand Member, which are both late Eocene in age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1965).
The Tyler Greensand Member contains glauconitic green sand with abundant ironstone
concretions and the Sparta City Sand formation is composed of quartz sand and clay along with
concretions and ledges of ironstone and ferruginous sandstone. The route also crosses one
intermittent tributary that flows south to West Mud Creek, which eventually drains south into the
Angelina River. The western end of the route is situated on a small ridgeline that overlooks the
headwaters of two small intermittent tributaries that drain to the northwest into Indian Creek,
which eventually drains west into the Neches River.
The project area is within the Wolfpen-Pickton Soil Association which consists of sloping to
moderately steep, well drained soils that have a sandy surface that overlie loamy subsoil
(Hatherly 1993: General Soil Map and pg. 7). Specific soils encountered in the roadway
extension route are Pickton loamy fine sand with 1 to 6 percent slopes (PkC), which is an upland
soil found on broad interstream divides; Wolfpen-Urban land complex with 1 to 6 and 8 to 15
percent slopes (WuC and WuE), which are upland soils in an urban setting; occasionally flooded
Owentown loamy find sand (Ow), which is a nearly level soil found on floodplains, levees and
alluvial fans; Oakwood fine sandy loam with 5 to 8 percent slopes (OkD), which is a strongly
sloping upland soil; and Oakwood-Urban land complex with 2 to 6 percent slopes (OuC), which
is a gently sloping upland soil in urban settings (Hatherly 1993: Sheet 32). The topsoil for these
soil types is generally approximately 80cm thick over the parent rock or clay subsoil.

CULTURAL HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Smith County is situated in the Pineywoods archaeological region of east Texas as defined by
Perttula (2004) and in the Gulf Coastal Plain region as defined by Story (1990). The prehistoric
era is divided into four major periods, Paleoindian (10,000 to 6,000 B.C.), Archaic (6,000 – 200
B.C.), Early Ceramic (200 B.C. – 800 A.D.) and Late Prehistoric (800 – 1700 A.D.). These
periods are further divided based on differences in technological styles (Table 1).

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period ranges from 10,000 to 6000 B.C. Distinctive lanceolate points are the
most recognized artifact from this period and these stone tools were typically manufactured from
high-quality non-local lithic materials (Perttula 2004:373). Only meager evidence of Paleoindian
occupation has been recovered in the region, and invariably projectiles recovered from mixed
contexts represent this period. Bever and Meltzer (2007:Table 1) report Clovis points from Hunt
[3], Van Zandt [2], and Wood [2] counties, and only one from Smith County. Paleoindian
peoples were thought to have been nomadic big game hunters, yet it is more likely that they were
generalized hunters and gatherers (Bryant and Shafer 1977:19-20). Early Paleoindian
archaeological sites are so thinly spread that they really only exist as isolated artifacts throughout
these vegetative regions of Northeast Texas (Story 1990: Table 44). The majority of these sites
consist of isolated finds of single Clovis points recovered from the surface or in mixed context.
Late Paleoindian archaeological sites are associated with unfluted lanceolate such as Dalton,
Scottsbluff and San Patrice points. San Patrice points have been recovered from sites

concentrated near the Sabine River Basin in east Texas (Story 1990: Table 47; Jennings 2008).
All of these sites consist of one or more points recovered from the surface or in mixed contexts.
Archaic
The transition from the Paleoindian into the Archaic is marked by a much drier environment
(Prikryl 1990:69), which allowed for the expansion of prairie habitats from the west. This period
also demonstrates an increased diversification of types of notched projectile points such as Gary,
Kent and Godley. Evidence from Early Archaic sites reveal highly mobile foraging groups
concentrated in the uplands away from major drainages and utilizing expedient lithic technology
(Anderson 1996:157-160). Excavations at sites like the Yarbrough site in Van Zandt County
(Johnson 1962) and the Limerick site at Lake Tawakoni demonstrate occupation probably before
A.D. 1. The archaeological record of the Middle Archaic reveals that occupational patterns were
concentrated in the major river basins of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannas, and had
limited use of the smaller tributaries and headwater areas (Thurmond 1990). Sites from this
period are typically open campsites with a variety of distinctive blade-notched stone hunting
tools, generalized cutting and scraping tools, groundstone tools, and cores (Perttula 2004). The
occurrence of burned rock features increases, suggesting that an increase in cooking and plant
processing was a more important activity for their subsistence. Late Archaic archaeological sites
in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna are typically found along major streams near springs
on upland ridges.
Early Ceramic
The Early Ceramic period, also referred to as the Woodland or the Fourche Maline period, is
marked by the occurrence of sand tempered plain and thick walled ceramic bowls, flowerpotshaped jars, double-bitted axe heads, smaller and thinner projectile points such as Gary points
and corner-notched arrow points (Thurmond 1990; Perttula 2004). Early Ceramic sites have been
reported at Lake Fork Reservoir, but more recent Early, Middle, and Late Caddo sites are better
known (Perttula and Skiles 1988; Perttula, Skiles, and Yates 1993). Evidence from sites dating to
the Early Ceramic period suggests the introduction of horticulture to the region, yet these people
probably maintained a relatively mobile hunting and gathering lifestyle (Perttula 2004:377). It
was the Early Ceramic period when burials appear associated with semi-permanent occupation
areas. Burial mounds dating to the Early Ceramic period have been documented in the Angelina,
Neches and Sabine River basins in deep east Texas. These burials are usually found on blufftops
and alluvial valley settings (Perttula 2004:377). The wide variety of non-local raw materials and
artifacts associated with these sites also suggests long distance trade networks.
Late Prehistoric
Archaeological information from the Formative, Early and Middle Caddo periods greatly
increases in this region during these periods (Perttula 2004). Evidence of the rich cultural
tradition from this period is found in ethnohistorical records and archaeological sites contain
beautifully decorated ceramics, earthen mounds, well-preserved villages and hamlets. Caddo
sites are typically situated on alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges along
major and minor streams and spring fed branches. Permanent settlements with residential

structures, cemeteries and refuse middens comprise the majority of archaeological evidence for
occupation during this period. Extensive research has been done on many of these sites, as well
as excavations of burial mounds and residential areas, which has led to a better understanding of
these people. The artifact assemblages from sites speak of the rich material culture within these
regions. Corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points, siltstone and greenstone celts,
perforators and borers, expedient scrapping and cutting tools, ceramic pipes, earspools and
figurines have all been recovered from excavations in these regions. A wide variety of ceramics
is also associated with sites from these periods and includes, but is not limited to, engraved,
incised, punctuated, neck banded, brushed and stamped varieties. Caddo settlements from this
period are widely distributed throughout the major river basins (Perttula 2004).
Distinctive forms such as long neck bottles and carinated bowls appear during the Formative
Caddo [AD 800-1000], along with incised and stamped decorations of vessels. Sanders Focus
occupation occurred during the Early Caddo period [AD 800-1000] and evidence indicates that
these people cultivated maize in the floodplain and also hunted and gathered native plant and
animal species (Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula and Skiles 1988). Red hematite slip becomes
prevalent on carinated bowls and bottles, with decorations including curvilinear and scroll
engraved, horizontal engraved, complicated incising, Coles Creek Incised, Spiro Engraved,
Crocket Curvilinear incised and Hickory Engraved (Perttula and Bruseth 1995:55). Middle
Caddo occupation occurred between AD 1200 and 1400. Decorations of vessels continued to be
complex, with engraved, curvilinear, scrolled and horizontal or decorative motifs on bowls and
bottles. Types identified include Canton Incised, Maxey Noded Red Ware, Hickory Engraved,
and Sanders Engraved (Perttula 2004). The Late Caddo occupation [AD 1400-1700] is attributed
to the Titus Focus and continued earlier subsistence patterns (Perttula, Skiles, and Yates 1993).
Historic
The first Europeans to have visited the east Texas area were the Spanish of the DeSoto
expedition (A.D. 1542) and the French led by LaSalle (A.D. 1686-87). The Historic Indian
Period (A.D. 1600-1800) is poorly known archaeologically. This may be due to the fact that
Caddo society was by that time on the decline and large areas were being abandoned, perhaps
due to new climatic patterns (Perttula and Nelson 2004:162). This period is associated with the
Allen Focus, referring to the Tejas (Hasinai) tribes. It typically consists of small villages
depending on agriculture and some hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Even if East Texas, including Smith County, became a part of the Spanish empire it was a zone
of contention between French and Spanish, the area was at the time only loosely settled by
Europeans. Anglo-Americans started to migrate to the region between 1812 and 1821, after
which the Republic of Mexico encouraged the Anglo settlers to come. Early settlers to the area
found plentiful resources. The most valuable resource was water, and the city of Tyler owes its
placement to the abundant springs in the area. During the Civil War, Tyler had the largest
Confederate ordnance plant in Texas and was the site for Camp Ford, a Confederate prison
camp. By the late 1880s, Tyler was the focal point for several railroads, which caused a growth
spurt. These rail connections allowed Tyler to become the focal point of Smith County. Records
show that, by 1853, the study area was owned by two landowners, Mr. Jacob Krumm and Mr.
Oliver Anderson (Boyd 2008: Map 35). A new wave of immigration to east Texas occurred after

1837 when prospect of free lands in the Texas Republic attracted many from the Southern states.
Two years later, all native populations had been displaced from the region. Tyler had two
newspapers by 1885. Tyler achieved city status in 1907 and adopted a manager-commissioner
form of government by 1915.
In the 1870s, the railroad allowed the timber industry to thrive, and oil further diversified east
Texas’ economy. The Saint Louis Southwestern Railway Company was chartered in 1891 and
had a business office in Tyler (Werner 2011). The company owned and managed 1000s of miles
of track, including lines that ran from Tyler to Corsicana, Big Sandy and Lufkin. The railroad to
Lufkin is crossed by the proposed road and was purchased in 1899 when the Southwestern of
Texas merged with Tyler Southeastern Railway and operated the 90-mile line. Since the 1950s,
ranching has become one of the most important agricultural industries in the region.
Interestingly, fruit orchards were one of the major economic resources, but the peach blight
wiped out most of the peach orchards (Long 2011). The planters than began to grow roses, which
were ideally, suited for the soil and Tyler became the rose capital of Texas and was a major
exporter of roses to the rest of the United States. Because of the Oil Boom in 1930, the petroleum
industry became one of the city’s economic resources. During World War II, Camp Fannin was
constructed 10 miles northeast of the city, which also added Tyler’s economy. Review of the
1936 and 1956 Smith County Highway maps and the 1948 and 1966 USGS topographic maps
show numerous structures and residences in and around Tyler.
By the middle 1960s, Tyler emerged as one of the leading medical and educational centers of the
area. The University of Texas at Tyler today was once Tyler State College. Today Tyler
continues to grow. Its economic resources are varied which include agriculture, the rose industry,
the petroleum industry, manufacturing and its university (Long 2011).
Previous Investigations
Major archaeological investigations have been carried out in Smith County. The best known are
those done in conjunction with the construction and level increase of Lake Palestine.
Archaeological survey of the Lake Palestine area was begun in 1957 under the auspices of the
National Park Service River Basin Surveys (Johnson 1961). Johnson reported 35 prehistoric sites
all but one of which yielded Caddo ceramics. The majority of the sites were attributed to the
Frankston focus. One site was considered an Alto focus site and one site was termed an Archaic
site because of the absence of pottery and the presence of large lithic artifacts. No excavation
was conducted as a result of the survey.
In 1969 and 1970, the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University
surveyed the edges of the lake as part of planning for enlarging the lake. A total of 98 sites were
recorded (Anderson 1972, 1973). SMU excavated a Civil War salt factory known as the Neches
Saline (Skinner 1971), as well as 10 prehistoric sites (Anderson, Gilmore, McCormick and
Morenon 1974). Additionally, Shafer (1981) reported on the salvage excavation of a prehistoric
Caddo burial contained in a small hamlet exposed by water erosion on the west side of the lake.

In the mid-1970s, the Archaeology Research Program also surveyed a proposed lignite mine in
northeastern Cherokee County (Scott, McCarthy and Grady 1978). Subsequent to this work,
Environment Consultants and then AR Consultants conducted more intensive survey of this area
for the Exxon Coal Company (Skinner 1981, 1984). These surveys documented a wealth of
information about the historic settlement of the area and provided some information about the
spatial patterning of prehistoric sites. In large part, prehistoric sites were found in the middle
reaches of the watersheds where the investigators postulated that a wide variety of natural
resources were readily available along with a constant source of water, even during major
drought periods.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), a number of surveys have been
conducted in the vicinity of the study area. Several were conducted in 1977 by the Texas Water
Development Board as part of Environmental Protection Agency permits (TASA 2011). Just
west of Loop 323 and on the south side of Indian Creek, Hayden Whitsett recorded site 41SM95.
The site consists of three flakes found on the surface and the deposit might extend to 15 cm
below the surface. Approximately 2,850 feet west of Loop 323 and west of site 41SM95, two
flakes were found on the surface and recorded as site 41SM59. Cooper and Cooper (2004) of C
Dimension conducted an area survey of an approximately 13.25-acre HUD tract located
immediately south of Loop 323. Though 33 shovel tests were excavated in the project area, no
cultural resources were located. In early 2009, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a comprehensive
survey of the New Sunnybrook Drive roadway extension, which is less than a mile to the north
of the current study area (Todd 2009). No sites were recorded however, and this was attributed to
the location of the roadway route in the edge of the upland, where even seasonally available
water resources are limited.
Additionally, TASA (2011) shows that a survey was conducted along FM 2493 (Old
Jacksonville Hwy) and no sites were recorded during the study. One previously recorded site,
41SM160, is situated on the west side of the FM 2493 near the railroad tracks. Georgeanna Greer
recorded the site in 1984 for a book on Texas pottery (TASA 2011). The site consists of a
historic pottery site with stoneware sherds on the surface and kiln furniture. Perttula and Nelson
(2000) conducted an archaeological survey of a water pipeline west of Loop 323 that also
extended west and followed the banks of West Mud Creek. No sites were recorded in the
immediate vicinity of this study area, but two miles to the south site 41SM203 was recorded. The
site consists of lithic artifacts on the surface and in the shovel tests at the headwaters of Butler
Creek. The authors describe the site as a shallow deposit and say that it is situated in the Pickton
Soil series on a small ridge above the drainage, similar to the western terminus of the Towne
Park Dr/Lake Placid Rd route. Additionally during this survey, the authors recorded site
41SM273. This site consists of a village site that dates to the Woodland Period, with later
occupations in the Early and Middle Caddo. The site is situated on an alluvial terrace above West
Mud Creek. The site contained numerous pieces of ceramics, lithics and faunal remains. The site
could not be avoided by the pipeline project and was subsequently tested and mitigated (Perttula,
Nelson, Walters and Kugler 2001; Perttula and Nelson 2004).
Several historic cultural resources are located within a one-mile radius of the study area. The
Azalea Residential Historic District (#03000559) is a National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) district located approximately 3300 feet to the northeast of the study area, and consists

of an architecturally notable neighborhood dating to the early 1900s (TASA 2011). The James
Stephenson Hogg House (#3001009553) is a neighborhood survey-listed historic residence
within the NRHP district. Two cemeteries are located to the south of the study area, and include
an unknown cemetery near the intersection of Goss Street and Frankston Highway (SM-C071)
and the St. Louis Cemetery (SM-C072), which is an African-American cemetery located south of
Old Noonday Road. Additionally, to the east of the Azalea Historic District, is the Rose Hill
Cemetery (SM-C073).
A review of historic maps of the area, demonstrated the high historic archaeological potential of
the route. The 1936 Smith County Highway maps show only three structures near the route, two
being mapped just outside the ROW and one at the approximate location of Lake Placid and Old
Jacksonville Hwy. The 1956 Smith County Highway map shows the project area being within
the city limits, but the area was not mapped in detail with regards to structures. The 1948 Tyler,
TX 15’ USGS topographic map shows numerous structures within or adjacent to the route. The
1966 and photorevised 1973 Tyler South, Texas 7.5’ USGS topographic maps for Tyler South
shows similar results as the 1948 (Figure 3). However, the later maps show more accurately
numerous structures closer to their actual location along the route and reveal that approximately
18 structure locations could be within in the route. This map review demonstrates that the
structures within the ROW could date between 1936 and 1966.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The records review indicated no recorded prehistoric sites in the survey area, yet historic maps
reveal as many as 18 possible historic sites within the route. Yet based on the known prehistoric
and historic archaeology of the area, we proposed the following two research questions to
address the archaeological potential of the area.
Since lithic scatters have been found within the general area of the proposed roadway extension,
sites of indeterminate age similar to sites 41SM59 and 41SM95 might be present within the
route. A site like 41SM203, which is situated on a small ridge overlooking the headwaters of a
small tributary, could be present within the route on the western end, where a small ridge
overlooks the headwaters of two intermittent tributaries. Additionally, a site similar to 41SM273
might be present near the unnamed intermittent tributary of West Mud Creek that is crossed by
the Lake Placid Rd. However, this location is different from the alluvial terrace near a perennial
drainage described at the site. Nonetheless, this unnamed tributary contains the only floodplain
sediments crossed by the route and are similar to the sediments at 41SM273 that Perttula and
Nelson (2004:6) describe. According to them, the Caddo were farming these sandy loams. The
mapped sediments recorded along the unnamed tributary are Owentown loamy fine sand, which
is occasionally flooded (Hatherly 1993:Sheet 32). The B-horizon is described as being 4-11
inches below the surface therefore trenching was not recommended as artifacts should be
recovered by shovel testing. Prehistoric sites like these could be situated within the route and
would consist of lithic and/or ceramic sherd scatters.
The second question addresses historic site potential in the region. There is potential for historic
sites since the region has been occupied and utilized by European settlers since the mid-1800s.
Previous investigations attest to this potential. Based on the recorded historic residences in the
area and a review of historic maps, it was expected that historic sites could be found along the
entire route. Historic sites commonly occur near old transportation routes such as roads and
railroad tracks, similar to the ones that bisect the entire route or are paralleled like on the eastern
end for the widening of Lake Placid Rd. The 1948 Tyler, Texas 15’ USGS topographic map,
demonstrates that historic structures could along the entire route. Information from the City’s
GIS database of mapped structures and verbal confirmation from our client’s engineers
demonstrate that evidence of that there are no standing structures within the ROW. Site types
possible for the route include collapsed structures or foundations for homes or farmsteads,
cemeteries, and trash or artifact scatters that would be associated with the locations of previously
mapped structures or near the drainage or transportation route crossings.
Methodology
The field teams walked parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart along the route, and made
thorough field notes about ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests were
excavated at an interval of approximately 100 meters, where ground visibility was less than 30

12

percent, and near the channel crossing. Each was excavated to the bottom of the Holocene
deposit according to THC standards (n.d). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter, and were
supplemented by an auger when necessary. The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected
visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present.
Sandy soils from the shovel tests were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Photographs were
taken throughout the survey area using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel
test matrices were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was
used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. Shovel test and site locations were recorded
using either a Garmin GPS Map 76 or a Garmin Colorado 400t handheld GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections; the first describes the terrain and natural setting of
the study area. The results of the survey follow, and conclusions derived from the survey end the
chapter. Archaeological sites recorded during the survey are discussed throughout the results.
Shovel tests are described generally within the text, while complete descriptions of the shovel
tests are found in Appendix A.
Survey Area
The eastern end of the route begins at the intersection of Lake Placid Rd and Old Jacksonville
Hwy (FM 2493) and parallels Lake Placid Rd west until it intersects with Old Noonday Rd. For
this portion of the route, new ROW will be acquired on the north side of Lake Placid Rd as
previously shown in Figure 2. Historic maps for this portion of the route showed that eleven
structures once lined the street between Old Jacksonville Hwy and San Jacinto Dr. The area has
been long since cleared of the structures, but small scatters of building debris including crushed
brick, window glass, wood and wire nails were still exposed on the surface (Figure 4). The
ground surface visibility was between 30 and 75 percent. The terrain was level to gently
undulating throughout this area. The gentle undulations are probably the remains of the
bulldozing during the demolition of the structures.

Approximately 50 meters east of the San Jacinto Dr. and Lake Placid Rd intersection, a densely
wooded area was reached. This area was similar to the remaining sections of the route along
Lake Placid down to Old Noonday Rd. Vegetation consisted of pines, greenbriar and hackberries
along with a few oaks and junipers. The ground surface visibility was diminished here, but
remained between 20 and 50 percent. The terrain began to slope down to the unnamed tributary
of West Mud Creek as the survey continued west. Upon reaching the tributary, it became clear
that the channel and surrounding area had been mechanically modified and the channel
straightened and concrete lined (Figure 5A and B).

Figure 5.

A. Looking north from Lake Placid Rd at the west bank of the tributary.
B. Looking north up the channelized and concrete lined channel of the tributary.

As the route continued west from the tributary, the route crossed the remains of a railroad berm
once associated with the Saint Louis Southwestern Railway. The areas on both sides of the
railroad berm were densely wooded similar to the previously described area. The terrain also
began to slope upward as the survey moved west away from the tributary. Once the route crossed
Old Noonday Rd, the ROW consisted of the entire 115’ easement for new road and no longer
paralleled existing roads. This cross-country portion was approximately 600 meters until
reaching the intersection of Cain, Wade and Seaton streets. This cross-country portion, was
densely wooded with similar vegetation and ground surface visibility. Continuing west, the route
crosses a partially cleared field that has dense vegetation along the side of Seaton St. The route
then crossed Frankston Hwy (SH 155) and proceeded west-northwest towards the intersection of
Carver and Seaton streets. This portion of the route passed through now vacant lots that had
ground surface visibility between 30 and 80 percent. The final 300 meters of the route, before the
western terminus and tie into Towne Park Dr., were densely wooded and undulating as the
terrain rose to the mapped knoll top. The ground surface visibility was between 20 and 50
percent.
Survey Results
A total of 53 shovel tests were excavated along the route from east to west (Figure 6). Some of
the shovel tests are associated with historic sites and they are discussed within the site
descriptions. Shovel testing began on the eastern end of the route in the small parcel acquired on
the south side of Lake Placid Rd for the widening of the intersection. Three shovel tests (ST)
(01-03) were excavated and contained a few varieties of brown sandy loams and sandy clays.

Only ST1 had topsoil, which was approximately 10 cm thick. ST02 and 03 had been stripped of
the topsoil and contained one yellowish brown sandy loam above the sandy clay, which was
reached 90 cm below the surface (cmbs). ST02 and 03 were positive with debris from the
demolition of the structure that once stood on the property. Many of these artifacts were also
exposed on the surface. The debris consisted of red brick fragments, wire nails, flat and curve
clear glass, amber bottle glass and various kinds of modern trash such as plastic shopping bags.
Only one dateable historic artifact was recovered in ST3, which is the broken base of an
undecorated whiteware saucer. The saucer had a maker’s mark that read “Buffalo Ch,” in cursive
script. Buffalo China produced ceramics from 1901 through 1986 and this mark is consistent
with some of their later marks dating it to the mid to late 20th century (Lehner 1988:63-66). No
identifiable features associated with the demolished structure were noted. Given the lack of
features, minimal historic artifacts mixed with modern trash and lack of context the area was not
recorded as an archaeological site.

Figure 6.

Shovel tests excavated along the length of the route shown on a portion of ESRI’s
Streetmap.

Shovel testing continued to the north side of Lake Placid Rd with similar sediment horizons as
previously mentioned. The area, as previously mentioned, once contained numerous structures
that are shown on the 1948 Tyler 15’ USGS topographic map, however, all of the structures had
been torn down prior to this survey. Still minimal evidence of these structures were scattered
around the surface of the area. The debris consisted of similar artifacts as the first parcel, mainly
brick fragments, wire nails, clear glass, concrete fragments and small fragments of lumber all of
which would date to the mid to late 20th century. Shovel testing continued and a small intact
brick feature was identified. This feature and associated trash scatter were recorded as site
41SM433 and is located at parcel address 1501 Lake Placid Rd. The brick was flush with the
ground surface and badly damaged from bulldozing.

The brick feature consists of a group of four bricks forming a square and a single line of bricks
originating from that square that were mortared together end to end. The single line of bricks
were approximately 162” long on the east/west axis by 200” long on the north/south axis
forming an “L” shape (Figures 7 and 8). The bricks were red and did not show any identifying
stamps or marks. Shovel testing around the feature demonstrated that there was no concrete
foundation and that the feature was similar to what was seen on the houses on the south side of
the street, that being a short brick wall enclosing the pier and beam foundation around the base of
the house. Most of these existing houses would have been constructed at the same time as the
north side and are mostly pier and beam wood frame houses with a short brick wall (1 to 2’ high)
enclosing the foundation. Since the site was bulldozed, the remaining portion of this brick feature
was removed, leaving only these two walls flush with the ground surface. Review of Google
Streetview maps along Lake Placed Rd revealed that the area was photographed prior to
demolition. Figure 9 shows the structure situated at 1501 Lake Placid Rd and the brick feature
portion of the foundation. Archival research revealed that this parcel along with virtually all of
the parcels along Lake Placid Rd were purchased in bulk by David Bart Keeling, Sr. Family
Limited Partnership from James R. Keeling in 1997. According to this 34-page deed record,
these properties have been low-income housing for 40 to 50 years. The current landowner has
rented out all of the structures on the south side of the street. The deed mentioned that some of
the properties had been acquired by a John McCullars from the Housing & Urban Development
in 1969, when many of these properties were transferred in bulk once again. Tying any of the
properties to a specific tenant along Lake Placid Rd would be near impossible since they were
rentals. The brick feature associated with 41SM433 was the only intact evidence of the structure.
No dateable artifacts were recovered from the area surrounding the site or in the two positive
shovel tests (07 and 10).

The remaining shovel tests along Lake Placid Rd contained various brown sandy loams over
sandy clay and were negative for cultural material. However, a mortared sandstone wall was
recorded as site 41SM437 approximately 160 meters west of 41SM433. The wall was situated on
the property line between 1611 and 1607 Lake Placid Rd. These two properties were also part of
the bulk real estate sales since 1969 and have been rental houses for several decades. The wall is
23’ long by 4” wide by 4” tall and begins north of the existing road easement. Surface
examination of the area revealed no evidence of a foundation or structure on either of the
properties. The area had been cleared and there was little to no construction debris on the
surface. The area around the wall was covered with leaves, but the areas closer to the actual
locations of the structures had 30 to 50 percent surface visibility. The quality of the Google
Streetview for these parcels was not of high enough quality to identify the feature in the
photographs, but the structures are shown on Figure 12.

Figure 10.

Plan map showing the location of the sandstone wall recorded as site 41SM437.

Shovel testing continued along Lake Placid Rd to the wooded area on the east side of San Jacinto
Dr, where the terrain began to slope westward down toward the unnamed tributary of West Mud
Creek. All of the remaining shovel tests in this area were negative and demonstrated similar soils
profiles to the previous tests. The subsoil along the north side of Lake Placid ranged from 25 to
90 cmbs, which was yellowish red or yellowish brown sandy clay. Of the shovel tests that were
positive along Lake Placid Rd, all of the artifacts were recovered in the top 50 cmbs.

One shovel test (18) was placed in the densely wooded area between San Jacinto Dr. and S. Vine
Avenue. ST19 and 20 were excavated on the east side of the tributary and were similar to ST18,
containing brown very fine sandy loams on top of one or two horizons of darker or lighter brown
sandy loams with a subsoil of yellowish red or strong brown sandy clay. The topsoil ranged from
5 to 12 cmbs. The subsoil was 90 cmbs in ST18, but was shallower in ST19 and 20 being
between 32 and 50 cmbs. ST 21 was excavated in the wooded area on the west side of the
tributary and contained a very similar profile to ST20. All of these were negative for cultural
materials and the area was thoroughly investigated for surface artifacts, however none were
found.

On the west bank, the terrain began to slope up as the route reached the location of the Saint
Louis Southwestern Railroad berm. The area of the berm was photographed and documented, but
no shovel tests were excavated due to the pronounced slope of the bar ditches that ran parallel to
it. A small culvert was noted where the berm crossed the bar ditch along the north side of Lake
Placid Rd. This area within the ROW was recorded as site 41SM438 (Figure 13A and B and
Figure 14). The culvert measured 4’ across the top, 28” tall and the opening was 3’ wide by 2’
tall. The berm for the railroad tracks was 20’ wide. The bar ditch running along the south side of
Lake Placid Rd had been dug through the berm and the culvert had been removed. This berm
partially represents the remains of the 90-mile line that ran from Tyler to Lufkin as part of the
1899 merger of railways previously discussed in the Culture History.

Figure 13.

A. St Louis Southwestern culvert (41SM438) crossing on the north side of Lake
Placid Rd. B. Only remaining tracks in Lake Placid Rd. View is to the north.

On the west side of the railroad berm, a pile of concrete, brick and asbestos represented the
remains of the structure and was recorded as site 41SM439 (Figure 14). This structure was
shown on both the 1948 and 1966 historic topographic maps in the triangular shaped parcel
bounded by Lake Placid Rd., Old Noonday Rd and the railroad berm. The site consists of pile of
debris and a sparse scatter of concrete, brick, glass and modern trash. Additionally, a concrete
retaining wall was identified near the property line. The wall was oriented north/south above the
bar ditch, but was largely out of the ROW. This feature measured 6” wide by 3-6” high by 50’
long and probably served to keep the soil from eroding into the bar ditch. This feature extended
approximately 12” into the ROW. The concrete mixture for the retaining wall was of finer
aggregate than that of the foundation, which contained very large aggregate. Along the edge of
the existing road easement a pushpile of sediment, concrete and trash lined the road (Figure 15).
All of the brick in the area was red and none showed any identifying marks or stamps. Shovel
tests began at the top of the slope above the bar ditch along the railroad berm and went west
toward the debris pile (Figure 16). ST22 and 23 were negative and reached subsoil between 70
and 90 cmbs. ST24, 25 and 26 were closer to the debris and contained similar soil horizons and
depths, but also contained brick fragments, flat and curved clear glass, wire nails and pieces of
asbestos tile. According to the deed research, the property changed hands numerous times (Table
2). Given that the structure was built before 1948, it was associated with one of several families.
The Adams, the Browns, the Clarks, the Sheffields or the Bass family all are likely candidates.
Based on the maps and the construction debris in the area the site dates to the early to mid 20th
century.

As the route continued west across the intersection of Old Noonday Rd and Lake Placid Rd, a
sandstone wall was noticed lining edge of the road easement and parallel to Old Noonday Rd.
This feature was recorded as site 41SM436 (Figure 17). The sandstone cobbles of the wall were
held together with mortar and the entire length was approximately 100’. The wall was 1.5’ tall by
1.5’ wide. The feature consisted of two separate walls being divided by a break in the center.
This break represented an entrance into the property (Figure 18). Decorative columns marked the
north and south corners of the wall, however the wall turned 90 degrees west at each end and in
the middle at the entrance, extending 6’ to 8’ back up the slope. The decorative columns were
3.5’ tall with a pyramidal top and a decorative rounded mound of mortar on top (Figure 19). The

wall was covered with thick vegetation, mainly greenbriar and other invasive vines. Shovel
testing began on the west side of the wall.
Six shovel tests were excavated in the area and all were negative for cultural materials. The
sediments were a variety of yellowish brown sandy loams over yellowish red sandy clay. The
shovel tests closer to the road, reached subsoil between 25 and 60 cmbs, but higher upslope the
last three were between 73 and 90 cmbs. While shovel testing, a brick feature, probably to a
foundation for a house was identified and was similar to what was recorded as 41SM433 on Lake
Placid Rd. The red brick was stamped with “Ferris,” and a few small red brick fragments. No
concrete or glass scatters were observed in the area. Ferris bricks were manufactured in Texas
between 1901 and 1926 (Gurcke 1987:234-235). Review of all the historic maps showed no
structure on the parcel, meaning it was either missed during mapping or it was removed prior to
1948. The brick feature and the sandstone wall are consistent with early to mid 20th century
construction and the area was littered with modern trash. Deed records show that the property
has been in the Caldwell family since 1938 and was transferred to the City in 2002 (Table 3).

The survey crew continued west from 41SM436 along the 400-meter cross-country portion of
the route towards the intersection of Wade, Cain and Seaton streets. Four shovel tests (33-36)
were excavated in this portion and all contained dark grayish brown sandy loams over yellowish
red sandy clay. These shovel tests were relatively shallow to the subsoil, which was reached
between 20 and 45 cmbs. The route then exited the cross-country portion into vacant wellmaintained lots. While shovel testing east of Wade St, two collapsed sandstone columns, similar
to the ones recorded at 41SM436, were identified in a small cluster of young hackberries and
were recorded as site 41SM434 (Figure 20). The parcel address was 3332 Wade St. The two
columns would have stood approximately 4’ apart and were nearly identical in size and shape to
the other columns recorded (Figure 21A and B). The main difference is that one of these
columns had text inscribed into the mortar (Figure 22). The inscription was broken and portions
were missing but there were three lines of legible information. The inscription read “MIE” above
“EEGO,” and the bottom line read “1941.” According to information from the neighbors on both
sides of the property, the structures on these lots had been torn down 30 plus years ago, when
they were children. The neighbor on the south side of the property had lived in that house for 54
years and said that the location of the two columns represented the front porch of the old house.
Neither of them remembers the tenant or landowner’s name. The part of the inscription that reads
“MIE” could refer to Amie Goss (Table 4), the landowner who sold the property in 1962, which
would be consistent with the fact that the area was platted as the Amie Goss Subdivision. The
1941 date could represent the year that that the house was built and would tentatively date the

Six shovel tests (37-42) were excavated in the area around the columns and three were positive
for artifacts in the top 40 cmbs. The artifacts consisted of clear glass-curved and flat, wire nails,
green bottle glass, scrap sheet metal and brick fragments. Shovel test sediments were similar to
others described along the route, but were much deeper to the subsoil, which was reached
between 110 and 160 cmbs.
Survey continued across Wade St into the small parcel on the east side of Frankston Hwy. Two
shovel tests were excavated in the wooded area. The first was negative, but the second contained
a metal hubcap at 50 cmbs. The area along the road was filled with trash and debris, but all the
mapped structures in the area were to the north out of the ROW and were still intact. After the
route crossed Frankston Hwy, a scatter of brick, concrete and glass, along with a foundation were
encountered and recorded as site 41SM435 (Figure 23 and 24). The site was situated along the
centerline of the route and shovel testing along the perimeter of the scatter were all negative. The
foundation consisted of a small slab with brick around the perimeter and one step. The
foundation measured 11’ by 7’ and was 11.5” tall. This likely represented the back porch of the
structure. Approximately 10 to 15 meters to the southwest was a large pile of various types of
brick, including Ferris, Whiteselle Cherry Reds and 3 hole of red and white varieties. The
production of Whiteselle Cherry Reds occurred between 1915 and 1924 and are consistent with
the Ferris production, in that they were both made locally in Texas (Gurcke 1987:314-345).
Behind the foundation, approximately 15 meters northeast the exposed top of a septic tank could
be seen on the ground.

View of site 41SM435. View is to the south.

According to the map review, there were two structures mapped very closely on the 1948 Tyler,
Texas 15’ USGS map on this property. By 1973, the two structures were gone and a single
structure was added to the photorevised topographic map. According to the deeds research, the
structure or structures likely belonged to the Goss, Lily, Watson or Johnson families (Table 5).
The earliest deed found for the property was recorded in 1898 when Will Goss purchased the
land from R.L. Brown. The next deed was in 1942, when Dola Lily, Amos Lily, Will Watson,
Nollie Watson, Will Goss, Jr., Mattie Goss and Albert Goss (guardian of Baby Ruth Goss
[minor]) were selling the land they inherited to Jessie Johnson. This could be the same Goss
Family that owned the property where 41SM436 was recorded. The Johnson Family owned the
property until 2009 when it was sold to Juanita Wedlow.

The survey continued west across Seaton St. toward western terminus for approximately 350
meters before reaching Towne Park Dr. The route passed by two structures, but were outside of
the ROW and reached a small cleared field where the terrain began to rise in elevation to the
route terminus (Figure 25). The cleared field represented the locations of two mapped structures
on the historic maps, however no remains or historic trash scatters were found in the area. The
current landowner was using the cleared field to store various items like boats, cars and scrap
metal as well as dumping trash inside the treeline. Past the cleared field was a heavily wooded
knoll, which was being accessed from Towne Park Dr and used for dumping. The dump included
various modern trash, tires and even a structure. The structure was consistent with mid to late
20th century construction. The structure was in very poor condition and was on cinder blocks
with no foundation or flooring (Figure 26). The roof had collapsed in and the majority of the
wood paneling had been removed exposing the fiberglass insulation (Figure 27A). The structure
appeared to be a modified mobile home that was “L” shaped and was 25’ long by 15’ wide.
Some of the interior rooms had been converted into an animal pen, using pallets (Figure 27B).
The trash scatter was situated on the east end of the structure (Figure 28A). The structure
contained a room at the western end, closest to the Towne Park Dr that contained small lockable
metal boxes similar to post office boxes (Figure 28B). The structure could have possibly been
used as a main office for a trailer park. None of the trash or construction materials in the
structure suggested an age older than 40 years, so the area was not recorded as a site. Review of
historic maps showed no structure in that location, but one was mapped to the north of it on the
1948 Tyler, TX 15’ USGS map. All of the shovel tests excavated on the knoll and near the
structure were negative with similar profiles as the other described shovel tests.

Conclusions
No prehistoric sites were recorded during the pedestrian survey despite the 53 shovel tests
excavated along the route and the fact that up to an average of fifty percent of the ground surface
was exposed the full length of the route. Furthermore, particular attention was given to exploring
for surface subsurface evidence of prehistoric sites in those areas defined as having a high
probability for having been selected for prehistoric can locations. Prehistoric sites were expected
to be near drainages. The route crossed an unnamed tributary of West Mud Creek on Lake Placid
Rd. This was a slightly similar setting to site 41SM273, which was recorded by Perttula and
Nelson (2000), except that 41SM273 was situated on an alluvial terrace above West Mud Creek.
Given the close proximity, the same watershed and similar flooded sandy loams, it was
conceivable that a site might have been present. However, no evidence was found in the area.
Additionally, a knoll is crossed near the western end of the route and this setting overlooks the
headwaters of two intermittent drainages. While the setting is similar to site 41SM203, no
evidence of prehistoric occupation was found.
Seven historic archaeological sites were recorded within the 115’ wide ROW along the 6500’
long route (Figure 29). As stated in the research design, remains of historic structures were likely
to be encountered along the route. Review of historic topographic maps (1948, 1966 and 1973)
showed that numerous structures were shown within and along the route. Sites like historic trash
scatters or isolated artifacts were expected to be found near drainages and the transportation
routes. One trash dump was located at the western end of the route, but none of the trash or the
dumped structure were older than 50 years and it was not recorded as an archaeological site.
Most of the sites recorded during the survey, corresponded to mapped 20th century structures that
had been demolished prior to this survey.
Site 41SM433 was recorded at the eastern end of the route on the north side of Lake Placid Rd
and consisted of a small brick feature that was associated with the foundation of the structure. No
dateable artifacts were identified but the site was consistent with mid-20th century construction.
According to the deeds research, the property had been a rental for nearly 50 years and the
structure was not associated with any person of significance to state or local history. Due to the
poor integrity of the site, no standing structures, and no known association with persons of
significance, the site is considered not eligible for listing on the (NRHP).
The second site recorded on the north side of Lake Placid Rd was 41SM437. The site consisted
of a small sandstone wall that appears to sit on the property line of two parcels. Deeds research
revealed the same information as 41SM433, being that both properties contained rental houses
and no dateable artifacts were identified in the area. Due to the poor integrity of the site, no
standing structures, and no known association with persons of significance, the site is considered
not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Just east of the intersection of Old Noonday Rd and Lake Placid Rd, two sites were recorded.
Site 41SM438 represents the remains of the late 19th century St Louis Southwestern Railroad
berm. The tracks had been long abandoned and removed and only a small culvert and tracks in
asphalt of Lake Placid Rd remain. Due to the poor integrity of the site, it is not considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP. In the parcel immediately to the west, , site 41SM439 was

recorded. The site represents the bulldozed remains of a mid-20th century structure that now
consists of a scatter of brick, glass, concrete, and asbestos tiles. Three shovel tests were positive,
but contained the same types of materials seen on the surface and all dated to the mid-20th
century. The property was sold approximately every 5 to 10 years, between the 1930s and the
1960s. Due to the poor integrity of the site, lack of standing structures, and no known persons of
significance being associated with the site, it is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP.

Figure 29.

Archaeological sites shown on a recent aerial photograph.

Across the intersection of Old Noonday Rd and Lake Placid Rd, site 41SM436 was recorded
when the remains of a sandstone wall was identified running parallel to Old Noonday Rd. The
wall was approximately 100’ feet long with a break in the middle representing an entrance.
Decorative columns marked the north and south corners of the wall. Shovel testing in the area
revealed no subsurface deposit and a small in situ brick feature representing the only evidence of
a structure. Additionally, a scatter of red “Ferris” brick was identified on the surface dating the
site to the early to mid-20th century. No structure was mapped on the property on any of the
historic maps. A few families mainly owned the property, but none appeared to be of
significance to state or local history. Due to the poor integrity of the site, lack of standing
structures, and no known persons of significance, it is considered not eligible for listing on the
NRHP.
Site 41SM434 was recorded near the intersection of Cain, Wade and Seaton streets. The site
consisted of two broken sandstone and mortar columns similar to the ones found on the ends the

wall at 41SM436. According to the neighbors, the house was torn down approximately 30 years
ago, when the neighbors were children and the columns represented the front porch of the
structure. One of the columns had an inscription in the mortar that held the sandstone cobbles
together. The inscription read “MIE” above “EEGO” and the final line was “1941.” According to
deeds research, Amie Goss probably owned the house at the time of construction. The 1941 date
is consistent with the light scatter of artifacts recovered in the shovel tests in the area. However,
due to the poor integrity of the site, lack of standing structures, and no known persons of
significance, it is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
The final site recorded during the survey was 41SM435. The site is situated at the intersection of
Seaton St and Frankston Hwy. The site consisted of a small concrete foundation and a step, a pile
of bricks, a septic tank and a scatter of brick, glass and concrete. The small foundation probably
represents the back porch of the structure. All of the shovel tests in the area were negative and
the entire scatter was consistent with mid-20th century. The property was in the Goss, Watson
and Lily family since the turn of the century before being sold to the Johnson family in the
1940s. Review of historic maps revealed that in 1948, two structures were mapped in the general
location. However, by 1966, the structures were gone and a new one had appeared on the 1973
topographic map. Due to the poor integrity of the site, lack of standing structures, and no known
persons of significance, it is considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Given the results of the pedestrian survey, ARC recommends that none of the seven historic
archaeological sites recorded are eligible for listing on the NRHP. All of the historic sites date to
the mid-20th century and none contains any residences. All of the sites consisted of early to mid20th century artifacts scatters along with features that would have been associated with the
demolished structures. All of the sites are consistent with the numerous other 20th century sites
that have been recorded in the area and in Northeast Texas and are unlikely to contribute to the
overall knowledge and history of the region. Additionally, no prehistoric sites were identified
even though sites have been recorded in similar settings. ARC recommends that further
archaeological investigations are unwarranted and the project should proceed as planned. If
cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should immediately cease in that
area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. Work
should not continue until discussions with the proper agencies have been concluded.
