Abstract
Modeling Hunter-gatherer Ceramic Production and Use: A Test Case from the Upper
Texas Coastal Plain

Larkin Napua Hood
Chair of the Supervisory Committee:
Professor J. Benjamin Fitzhugh
Anthropology
Archaeological research continues to document the manufacture and use of
ceramic containers in hunter-gatherer contexts in times and places unexpected by
conventional anthropological and archaeological theories of ceramic vessel use. The
upper Texas coastal plain is a unique area because of its long-standing tradition of
ceramic vessel production and use by relatively egalitarian, mobile hunter-gatherers.
Traditional models of ceramic vessel production and use associate pottery with
significant social, political, and/or economic change. In order to assess the roles of
hunter-gatherer pottery in food production and processing, storage, and prestige
contexts, I evaluated three sets of hypotheses of pottery function derived from
traditional archaeological ceramic theory, behavioral ecology, and foraging theory.
I analyzed pottery from three late ceramic period (AD 600-contact)
archaeological sites on the upper Texas coastal plain by paring traditional and
developing analytical methods: 1) morphological analysis of attributes on ceramic
vessels relating to vessel use and the degree of labor invested in production; 2)
petrographic sourcing to detect degrees of movement and trade; 3) analysis of organic
residues absorbed in the vessel body to determine types of food resources used; 4)
thermoluminescence dating of pottery to achieve temporal control.
Analysis of manufacturing attributes and use-wear characteristics of ceramic
assemblages from three upper Texas coastal plain archaeological sites indicate that
while vessels were engineered for direct use over heat, they were infrequently used in
this manner. Organic residue signatures from selected sherds indicate that pottery was

used for processing plant foods, especially on the site located on the coastal margin, but
in upland and interior sites it was used for processing plants and large-bodied mammals.
While the results of these analyses do not unequivocally disprove any other of
the three vessel function hypotheses, they do provide more insight on mobility patterns
and diet. Luminescence dates indicate that at least some of the portions of the sites are
contemporaneous. Assuming that portions of these sites are contemporaneous, I suggest
that there were two separate populations on the upper Texas coastal plain. The coastal
margin population relied on primarily on small-bodied, r-selected resources, and a more
mobile inland population used greater amounts of large-bodied resources. Mineralogical
data indicate that the minerals in UTCP pottery samples are of local provenance, which
is expected for groups with low residential mobility. Local mineralogical sources and
the overall undecorated nature of the pottery assemblages suggest that UTCP wares
were not frequently associated with ceremonial or social/political/economic prestige
events.

CHAPTER 1: GOALS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY
Traditionally, archaeologists have assumed that the presence of pottery can be
used to infer a fairly sedentary settlement pattern and a reliance on starchy seeds
and/or cultigens (e.g., Childe 1951). This has been a traditional assumption in parts of
the American Southeast, in particular the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). The upper
Texas coastal plain (UTCP) lies immediately south and west of the LMV cultural
region, and has similar environmental and cultural characteristics (Figure 1.1). Like
most of their LMV neighbors, UTCP groups made and used pottery (possibly as early
as 2,600 B.P.; Ensor and Ricklis 1998), and continued doing so through contact with
Europeans and Euro-Americans. While some LMV groups, particularly the Caddo,
shifted to horticulture beginning around AD 800, UTCP groups continued hunting,
fishing, and gathering wild foods. While some aspects of upper Texas coastal plain
hunter-gatherer adaptations are known, others are not as well understood. In particular
the degree of mobility and the nature of mobility patterns of groups occupying this
area are not fully known. Some aspects of subsistence are well documented, while
othersâsuch as the nature and significance of plant useâare not.

Using pottery to understand hunter-gatherer variability
Prior to 12,000 years ago, hunting and gathering wild foods was the way all
human groups made a living worldwide (Thomas and Kelly 2006). As the oldest form
of human socioeconomic organization, hunter-gatherer adaptations through time and
across space are diverse, yet are characterized by a reliance on wild foods (Kelly 1995;
Kuhn and Stiner 2001). Clearly there is no one âformâ of this adaptation. Huntergatherer societies vary considerably in their subsistence practices, mobility, and social
organization (Kelly 1995). For example, while harvesting wild foods defines huntergatherers, some hunter-gatherer societies use certain resources so intensively that the
distinction between wild and domesticated food is blurred. Other societies may engage
in long-term storage to such a high degree that they do not resemble the stereotype of

2
highly mobile hunter-gatherers uninterested in acquiring large amounts of resources
they cannot immediately use. A strong interest in understanding how small-scale, nonagricultural societies function and evolve has been part of archaeology since its
earliest days (Kelly 1995). Current research continues to document and explain the
immense variability in this earliest form of economic and social organization among
humans.
A promising yet underutilized tool for understanding economic and social
variability in hunter-gatherer societies is pottery. Focusing attention on the function of
pottery in hunter-gatherer contexts has the potential to increase understanding of the
variety of subsistence, settlement, and social adaptations in which ceramic vessels
have been adopted. Studies of ceramic function have the potential to provide deeper
insight on the nature of hunter-gatherer subsistence, settlement, and social/economic
stratification.
The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate three possible explanations of the
circumstances under which prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups chose to make and use
ceramic vessels on the upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP). This is accomplished by
analyzing the functions of pottery manufactured by Late Prehistoric period (AD 600contact) hunter-gatherers on the UTCP. While this study ostensibly contributes to
regional knowledge of the UTCP, the information gained here also contributes to
general comparative knowledge of hunter-gatherer pottery. The research presented
here is predicated on the idea that pottery use is related to both social and economic
behavior. The work is designed to advance archaeological understanding of economic
and social contexts in which pottery was made and used, as well as hunter-gatherer
adaptations in general, including diet, coping with food shortages, the role of food
production, prestige behavior, and socioeconomic inequality.

Pottery function and hunter-gatherer adaptations: theoretical approaches
In traditional archaeological thought, pottery belongs to a suite of behaviors
associated with food production and sedentariness (Childe 1951; Rice 1987). Indeed,

3
pots can be useful tools for efficiently processing and storing domesticated food
resources among sedentary populations. Ceramic vessels are useful in processing plant
foods, as they allow prolonged unattended boiling over fire, a process which helps
break down silica cell walls to increase digestibility. Food storage is an ideal function
of pottery; storage in ceramic vessels protects foodstuffs from vermin and moisture
(Rice 1987). Discovery and documentation of pottery in contexts of hunter-gatherer
societies has called into question conventional ideas of ceramic vessel function.
Archaeologists continue the process of creating new models of pottery production and
use among forager societies. Current models of ceramic vessel manufacture and
function are commonly based in environmental, economic, or ideological perspectives.
Human behavioral ecology has the potential to combine aspects of these current
models and thereby address the interplay between physical and social environments
and pottery production. Originally developed in the biological sciences (where it is
referred to as behavioral ecology), human behavioral ecology has been used for
decades by anthropologists to develop models to understand human behavioral and
cultural diversity in past and present societies (Smith 1983; Winterhalder and Smith
1992). Models generated from human behavioral ecology premises have been used to
understand the diversity of hunter-gatherer resource procurement, group mobility, and
other aspects of behavior. By using tools derived from human behavioral ecology,
models can be created which utilize pottery as a data set to address larger issues in
hunter-gatherer archaeology. The construction of models of pottery use using premises
derived from human behavioral ecology is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

Environment, archaeology, and ethnohistory of the upper Texas coastal Plain
The upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP) cultural area stretches between the
Sabine and Brazos Rivers, and extends from the immediate coastal margin up to 200
miles inland based on environmental characteristics and the ranges of historic native
groups in this area (Figure 1.1; Aten 1983). It includes the lower portions of the
Sabine, Trinity, and Brazos Rivers, as well as the lower and middle portions of the

4
San Jacinto River. The modern environment is assumed to be similar to that in which
prehistoric potteryâusing hunter-gatherers livedâalthough this may be due to the
paucity of paleoenvironmental information in the area. The UTCP is divided into four
basic environments: 1) inland longleaf pine and pine-hardwood forests traversed by
the Angelina and Neches Rivers and encompassing the Conroe-Livingston area; 2)
inland oak savannas and grasslands; 3) coastal upland prairie such as the Allens Creek
area, the upper section of the Lower Trinity, and the upper and middle sections of the
San Jacinto River drainage; 4) coastal marsh-prairie zone, which includes Sabine
Lake, Galveston Bay, Brazos Delta and West Bay (Aten 1983; Ricklis 2004a).

Environment
In the modern environment inland rivers link with the sea, creating lakes,
estuaries, brackish and freshwater marshes, bays, and barrier islands (Gagliano 1984;
Jeter et al. 1989; Ricklis 2004a). This is also where the grasslands of the west meet the
woodlands of the east, creating upland prairie environments spliced with southwestnortheast oriented bands of pine and oak-hickory woodlands. When speaking of
prehistoric human occupations, the four ecozones of the UTCP are often collapsed into
two basic environments: the immediate coastal margin, including the shoreline and
barrier islands, and inland prairie (Story 1990). The juxtaposition of these rich
environments provided a large suite of plant and animal resources present by 2,000 BP
(Ca. 500 BC) when the shoreline stabilized at its modern level and the barrier islands
achieved their present sizes and locations (Gagliano 1984; Ricklis and Blum 1997). By
2,500 BP (Ca. 550 BC) modern biota were established on the Texas Gulf Coastal
Plain, indicating a modern climate (Story 1990), although pollen records in central
Texas suggest that the modern post-oak savanna characteristic of the area was not in
place until 1,500 years ago (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Most of the pollen data
supporting this interpretation are derived from lakes and bogs in areas adjacent to the
UTCP (Bryant and Holloway 1985). A single notable exception is Aronow Bog
northeast of Houston which has yielded high amounts of oak pollen and charcoal

5
dating to 1,010 BP (Ca. AD 940), suggesting a drier environment (Beck at al. 2001).
Pollen cores from Aronow Bog show an increase in arboreal pollen and a decrease in
charcoal around 170 BP (Ca. AD 1780) (Aten 1999). It is unknown whether this
change in vegetation is due to climatic factors or anthropogenic fire suppression.

Modern food resources
Many species of modern animals and plants would have been available to
groups living on the coastal margin, including various species of saltwater and
freshwater fish, the brackish water clam Rangia cuneata, and to a lesser extent, oyster
(Crassostrea virginica). Fish species have overlapping spawning times from late
summer through winter, when they are at their maximum weights and easy to capture
in large amounts in the tidal passes of estuaries and bays (Nieland and Wilson 1993;
Pearson 1929; Soto et al.1998). Inland areas also have aquatic fauna, including various
species of freshwater mussels and freshwater fish such as alligator gar (Lepisosteus
tristoechus). It is probable that in the past, deerâhaving reached their heaviest
weights before winterâwould have been attracted to inland groves of nut trees in the
fall (Hall 1998). Deer are currently found on the coastal margin as well. Pronghorn
(Antilocapra americana) had a more extended prehistoric range than recently and may
have been present in the westernmost portions of the inland UTCP. Small mammals
would also have been available to inland groups (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Moore
1995).
A variety of edible nuts, seeds, roots, and fruits are common to both the coastal
margin and inland prairie environments (Hall 1998; Stahl 1995; Tull 1987). Cattail
(Typha sp.) is available in both coastal and inland riverine environments and has
edible seeds, roots, and stalks. Water lily (Nymphaea odorata), cane (Arundinaria sp.),
and bulrush (Scirpus californicus) also have various edible parts available throughout
the annual cycle. Major inland plant resources available include pecan (Carya
illinoiensis), oak (Quercus sp.), and hickory (Carya texana) nuts, which become
available in the fall. The pods of the honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var.

6
glandulosa) are available in the summer, as is the fruit of the prickly pear cactus
(Opuntia sp.). Prickly pear pads are available throughout the year. Plants with
comparatively higher harvesting and processing costs which were economically
significant in the prehistoric Southeast include amaranth (Amarantus sp.), available in
the summer and fall, as well as chenopodium (Chenopodium sp.) and pickerelweed
(Pontederia cordata) which have various parts available during all seasons.
Interannual variability in the local natural environment probably affected
prehistoric subsistence and mobility patterns as well. Coastal fish and shellfish
populations are subject to irregular catastrophic mortality from changes in salinity
caused by weather (such as sudden cold fronts common in the region) and changes in
sedimentation rates (Akberali and Trueman 1985; Aten 1999; Theroux and Wigley
1983). Tidal passes between barrier islands commonly fill with silt over periods of
several years and other passes open, creating more productive fishing locations
elsewhere. Catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes and tropical storms can
change the abundance and distribution of prey and may have made it necessary for
groups to relocate.

Archaeology
Archaeological sites in this area have yielded a variety of terrestrial and
aquatic fauna characteristic of the modern environments previously described. Coastal
margin sites dating after 5,000 B.P. are typically characterized by shell middens
containing aquatic fauna. There is no evidence of a significant maritime adaptation in
this area, although one or two examples of marine mammals have been recovered
from coastal margin sites, probably the result of prehistoric beach combing activities
(Hester et al. 1989). Terrestrial fauna recovered from coastal sites range from largebodied prey such as deer and the occasional bison to smaller animals such as raccoon
and turtle. Inland sites contain comparatively few faunal remains, probably because
the inland archaeological record does not have shell middens which alter soil
chemistry and subsequently preserve faunal remains as in the cases of coastal margin

7
shell-bearing sites. Bison remains are present on inland (and sometimes coastal)
archaeological and paleontological sites, although they are absent in the UTCP by AD
500 and do not reappear until around AD 1200-1300 (Dillehay 1974).
The role of edible wild plants in UTCP subsistence practices is not well
understood. Plant remains are extremely rare in archaeological sites in this area (see
Ensor and Ricklis 1998 for a report of a nut hull found at the Eagleâs Ridge site).
Isotope and dental analysis of human remains from Mitchell Ridge, a late prehistoric
and historic coastal margin site, indicate decreasing consumption of marine foods over
time and a possible increase in finely ground plant foods (Huebner 1994, Powell
1994). Other studies of human remains on the inland portion of the Texas coastal plain
suggest greater dependence on C3 rather than C4 pathway foods, at least in the Late
Archaic (ca. 1500 BC-AD600; Huebner and Boutton 1992).
UTCP groups most likely had to move to some extent in order to meet their
dietary needs; how frequently they moved and where they moved on the landscape are
questions which remain of interest to archaeologists working in the region.
Researchers working in this area have hypothesized that groups moved between
coastal margin and inland environments (Aten 1983), perhaps aggregating on the coast
during the winter months and moving to dispersed settlements to pursue large game in
the summer and fall (Moore 1995; Ricklis 1996). This idea of seasonal transhumance
between the coastal margin and inland areas is not supported by bioarchaeological
information derived from individuals interred in Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
cemeteries. These studies suggest that coastal margin and inland groups may have
been distinct populations who had little contact with one another. At least some
coastal UTCP groups had very little stress from disease or interruption of metabolic
growth based on a sample of Late Prehistoric burials (ca. AD 800-1528). Individuals
from inland cemeteries during the same period had slightly higher frequencies of
physiological disruption, although it is uncertain whether this is from diet or disease
(Powell 1987). A subsequent study of another Late Prehistoric coastal cemetery
indicated many individuals experienced high rates of endemic disease and possibly

8
poor nutrition (Powell 1990). Other research indicates that coastal margin and inland
area groups had distinctly different frequencies of treponematosis, implying that there
were distinct groups of people who occupied each area and did not mix with one
another (Wilson 2001). Yet the overall homogenous style of projectile points and
ceramics across the area suggests that groups had a great deal of contact with one
another.
Coastal margin and inland groups may have pursued separate resources. Other
research on human remains indicates that at least at some Late Archaic inland sites,
85% of the diet was comprised of C3 pathway plants with similar isotopic signatures
to deer and nuts (Huebner and Bouton 1992). It is possible that deer and nuts were so
plentiful on the inland portion of the coastal plain that inland groups did not need to
move from the interior to the coastal margin for subsistence purposes, although the
archaeological information available is inconclusive. It is also plausible that groups
moved between coastal and inland environments in order to overcome predictable
seasonal resource shortages. Furthermore, residential movement on larger temporal
scales may have been necessary, as weather patterns and geologic changes are often
parts of patterns which last more than a single annual cycle.

Ethnohistory
Cultural groups as they were identified and named by early Spanish, French,
and Anglo-American visitors are sometimes referred to in archaeological discussions;
ethnohistoric descriptions suggest that while groups had distinct languages, they had a
common economic and cultural background. The Atakapa occupied an area around
Neches and Sabine Rivers which extended into southwestern Louisiana. The Akokisa
(including the Han) lived immediately to the south and west, and their range extended
to just south of Galveston Bay. The Karankawa rangeâincluding a group referred to
as the Coco living between Galveston Bay and the Brazos Riverâmay have
overlapped with that of the Akokisa. Karankawa were reported to live from the
southern portion of Galveston Bay south to the Nueces River. The Bidai occupied an

9
exclusively inland area northwest of Galveston Bay (see Aten 1983 and Newcomb
1993 [1961] for detailed maps of posited group home ranges).
Accounts from early travelers and later settlers provide glimpses of what
prehistoric foraging may have been like on the UTCP. According to historic accounts,
individuals fished, but neither lines nor nets were used. Instead, fish were taken with
bow and arrow (Gastchet 1891). There is archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence of
waterfowl hunting; one ethnohistoric account mentions people taking waterfowl eggs
(Gastchet 1891). Food production does not appear to be critical or widespread among
prehistoric groups occupying the UTCP. A few ethnohistoric accounts claim that
groups living on the northeast inland portion of the UTCP did cultivate maize, but the
location and extent of this posited cultivation remains unknown from the
archaeological record (Aten 1983; Kniffen et al. 1987; Weddle 1985).
The spatial distribution of these food resources varied temporally throughout
the annual cycle. Members of the historic Atakapa group northwest of Galveston Bay
are reported to have hunted bison seasonally (Kniffen et. al 1987). Ethnohistoric
accounts indicate that groups moved to different locations to take advantage of fish
and roots of water plants available on a seasonal basis, during the winter months
(Cabeza de Vaca [1542] 2003). Cabeza de Vacaâs first account of UTCP natives near
or on Galveston Island indicates that there was some seasonal movement:
They inhabit this island from October to the end of February. They sustain
themselves on the roots that I have mentioned, which they dig out from under water in
November and December. They have waterways and they do not fish apart from this
period; from then on they eat the roots. At the end of February they go to other places
to look for food because at that time the roots begin to sprout and become inedible.
(Cabeza de Vaca 2003 [1542]).
It is not clear from this account or others where or how much people shifted their
residences during the annual cycle. Some ethnohistoric accounts mention people from
different ethnic groups converging on the same highly productive inland pecan grove
locations (Hall 2000). Other ethnohistoric accounts describe the homes of UTCP
groups as being comprised of poles and mats which could be taken down easily in an

10
hour or two and moved, sometimes by canoe (Gastchet 1891; Kniffen et. al 1987).
Such portable homes could be an indication of high residential mobility that had
antecedents in the prehistoric period, or perhaps groups became more mobile as
Anglo-American settlement affected their land-use patterns.
In summary, the environment, archaeology, and ethnohistory of the UTCP give
us a picture of a hunter-fisher-gatherer society who made and used pottery as part of
their adaptation to an environment rich in wild foods which were almost continually
available throughout the annual cycle (although they are not necessarily spatially
consistent). Other aspects of UTCP pottery period adaptations are less clear, including
the nature and extent residential mobility, the amount of plant useâincluding
cultigensâand the role(s) pottery played in these adaptations.

Goals and contributions of this study
In this study, premises of human behavioral ecology have been used to
generate three sets of hypotheses concerning pottery use on the UTCP, and these are
briefly described below. In order to begin modeling pottery use to unravel the
complexity and variety of hunter-gatherer adaptations, as well as their functions as
tools in hunter-gatherer societies, I have developed three sets of hypotheses presented
here in the null form. A more detailed discussion of the hypotheses can be found in
Chapter 3.

Hypothesis 1a: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as tools to process starchy
seeds and/or domesticates.
As mentioned earlier, processing plant foods such as starchy seeds is most
effectively done over a direct heat source. Vessels with thin walls conduct heat more
effectively than thick-walled vessels. Thin walls also minimize cracking and vessel
failure caused by differential cooling of interior and exterior vessel walls (Rice 1987).
Thus, if UTCP pots were used primarily to process plant foods such as starchy seeds,
then thin walls would be a desirable characteristic. Wide orifices allow unimpeded

11
access to vessel contents, a desirable attribute for vessels used for food processing
(Rice 1987).
Pots used to cook high volumes of plant resources commonly exhibit sooting
on their exterior and evidence of thermal spalling. Sooting is comprised of carbon and
resins deposited on the vessel surface as the result of fuel combustion and can indicate
if a vessel was used over heat (Hally 1983, Skibo 1992). Soot is most commonly
identified on archaeological ceramic vessels as patches on the interior and exterior
portions of the vessel wall. The location of sooting on the vessel can give information
on the position of the vessel relative to the heating source. Thermal spalling is also
evidence of use over a direct heat source. Spalling consists of holes created by the
vaporization of water in the vessel wall. Spalling can occur when water contained in
the clay body vaporizes due to firing, or when foods are simmered over direct heat and
run out of liquid (Skibo 1992). Vessels intended for frequent use over heat should also
have low frequencies of surface treatments which act to limit the porosity and
permeability of the vessel. Vessels used to process large amounts of plant foods would
be expected to retain organic residues of these resources.

Hypothesis 1b: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as tools to process meat from
large-bodied resources.
If UTCP pots were used primarily to cook meat from large-bodied animals,
then manufacturing characteristics associated with thermal performance over direct
heat would not be desirable. Instead, attributes associated with the physical stability of
vessels and their resistance to mechanical shock would be more useful in processing
animal foods. If large mammals were commonly processed in UTCP pots, then
minerals in vessel pastes the organic residue signatures could be expected to come
from non-local sources, the result of groups moving to follow game with large home
ranges. If mammals were commonly processes in these vessels, the organic residue
would be comprised of large mammals.

12
Hypothesis 2a: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used for âfront-loadedâ
storage.
Hypothesis 2b: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used for âback-loadedâ storage.
Parts of the empirical expectations for both of these hypotheses are based upon
the premise that narrow vessel orifices, thick walls, large sizes, and surface treatments
which reduce permeability are make effective storage containers. Orifices of storage
vessels are often constricted in order to restrict access to their contents (Rice 1987).
Thick walls are useful for storage vessels because they protect the pot from the effects
of mechanical shock (Rice 1987). Since storage vessels do not need to be moved
often, large size may not be a constraint of vessel performance (Longacre 1985).
Surface treatments limiting vessel permeability are desirable when vessels are used to
store liquids (see Rice 1987 for examples and exceptions). Vessels used primarily for
storage would be expected to have little or no evidence of use over direct heat. Vessels
used primarily for âfront-loadedâ storage would contain foods which must be highly
processed prior to storage (Bettinger 1999). Such a storage strategy requires relatively
high labor investment in preparing foods for storage. Foods requiring extensive
processing prior to storage are unlikely to be left behind as groups moved large
distances on the landscape, as leaving the stores would make them vulnerable to theft
from animals or other people. Such a storage method is most useful to groups who
have relatively low degrees of residential mobility because stores can be guarded. In
the case of âback-loadedâ storage, food processing costs are low. Instead, preparation
costs are incurred when the foods are prepared for consumption. Bettinger (1999)
suggests that a âback-loadedâ strategy would be most useful to foragers with high
degrees of mobility. Stores could be collected and cached with a smaller amount of
investment than âfront-loadedâ stores. Thus, foragers using a âfront-loadedâ strategy
would most likely be using pots made from local raw materials, since they are
expected to be tethered to their stores, while more mobile groups would have found a
âback-loadedâ strategy more useful.

13
Hypothesis 3: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as objects for gaining
and/or maintaining social, economic, or political prestige.
Ceramic vessels can be used to gain and maintain various forms of social,
economic, and/or political prestige. Prestige wares can function as objects of wealth in
and of themselves, or they can be a symbolic good used to legitimate authority (Rice
1999). Pots can also be used as tools for redistributing wealth, such as serving vessels
used for feasting (Hoopes 1995, Rice 1999). The empirical expectations for this
hypothesis are predicated on the following assumptions: prestige wares exhibit high
frequencies of substantial labor investment (Hayden 1995). Degrees of labor
investment can be measured by observing attributes of vessel construction and surface
treatment, including decorative embellishment. Utilitarian vessels are expected to have
little surface treatment or decoration (Costin 1991, Costin and Hagstrum 1995,
Hayden 1998). Such vessels may also be more desirable if they are made from exotic
materials or are a rare trade item. The paste of vessels used primarily in social or
political contexts may contain materials (aplastics or clays) from non local sources. It
is also possible that the primary function of ceramic vessels was to disseminate exotic
foodstuffs in social or political contexts. If this was a common function of UTCP
wares then assemblages from this area would be expected to contain organic residues
of exotic foods outside the local cultural area.

Methods
While many kinds of archaeological data can be used to test the hypotheses
discussed above, the archaeological record of the UTCP (and possibly the nature of
certain hunter-gatherer adaptations) leaves few avenues of inquiry except for direct
study of sherds. For example, grinding stones are often excellent indicators of plant
processing but are not present in the archaeological record of the area, probably
because there are few local rock sources. Groups may have processed plant resources
using wooden implements, a processing tool archaeologically and enthohistorically
documented in the Eastern Woodlands and South Texas (e.g., Collins and Hester
1968; Gilliland 1975; Krieger 1956; Willoughby 1935). Faunal remains can be very

14
useful in assessing the nature of the diet of groups in this area. Some sites
(especially shell-bearing sites) have well-preserved samples of faunal remains, while
others (especially non-shell bearing sites on the inland portion of the study area) have
fewer, if any. Thus, sherds are the primary unit of analysis for this study.
Hypotheses concerning vessel function are tested using standard and newly
developed methods of ceramic analysis on 5,155 sherds from three Late Prehistoric
period (AD 1100-contact) sites located in distinct microenvironments: coastal margin,
upland prairie, and an area which straddles both of these zones. Four types of analyses
were conducted on sherds to determine the function of vessels from these three UTCP
sites: non-destructive measurements and observations on sherds, petrographic analysis
of vessel fabric, organic residue analysis of absorbed lipids in sherd walls, and
luminescence dating of sherds from each site.
Initially, sherds were analyzed using a series of non-destructive techniques to
gain information on vessel size and shape, manufacturing characteristics of vessels
pertaining to potential function, and evidence of use for particular tasks. Sherds were
measured in order to calculate the size of the vessel (where possible) and the average
thickness of vessel walls. The types of inclusions in the sherd pastes were identified
and their frequencies were estimated. Other manufacturing characteristics such as
surface treatments were identified and their frequencies estimated. The type and
frequency of use wear characteristics pertaining to use over heat were also recorded.
Sherds representing a variety of surface treatments and use wear characteristics
were selected from the assemblage of each site to be analyzed in thin section to
determine if the minerals in sherd pastes were of local origin, or if sherds were from
non-local geological sources and therefore possible trade wares. Sherds representing a
variety of surface treatments and use wear characteristics were selected for organic
residue analysis to determine the presence and nature of food residues. A homogenous
sample of sherds was dated from each site using luminescence to determine if the
sherds were manufactured at the same time the sites were occupied.

Thesis structure
Chapter 2 summarizes the culture history of the UTCP and adjacent cultural
areas. Chapter 3 introduces the theoretical issues implicated with studying ceramic
vessel function to learn more about hunter-gatherer adaptations. I describe in detail the
three main hypotheses summarized above. I then explain how these hypotheses pertain
to subsistence, mobility, and social aspects of hunter-gatherer societies in general and
how they are theoretically linked to the possible function(s) of ceramic vessels on the
UTCP. Chapter 4 describes the three sites which were the focus of this study (Figure
1.1). Chapter 5 focuses on the results of the non-destructive analyses and explains how
they are used to evaluate the hypotheses detailed in Chapter 3. Chapter 6 presents the
results of the sourcing study and the information it provides in terms of evaluating the
hypotheses. Chapter 7 presents the results from organic residue analysis of selected
sherds and evaluates the hypotheses using this data. Chapter 8 synthesizes the
implications of the data analyses for determining the functions of UTCP ceramic
vessels, and evaluates the significance of this information for research on huntergatherer pottery in general, as well as suggested directions for future research.

CHAPTER 2: THE PROBLEM OF HUNTER-GATHERER
POTTERY ON THE UPPER TEXAS COASTAL PLAIN
People began using ceramic vessels on the coastal margin of the upper Texas
coastal plain around 2070-1900 B.P., and possibly as early as 2600 B.P. (Ensor and
Ricklis 1998). Inland, ceramics appeared somewhat later by 1500 B.P. (Aten 1983;
Ensor and Ricklis 1998). These dates are late compared to those in the rest of the
Southeastern United States, where the earliest pottery dates between 5000 and 3000
B.P. (Sassaman 1993). Immediately adjacent to the UTCP, the earliest wares are dated
between 3691 and 2791 B.P. (Gibson and Melancon 2004).
The prehistoric area of the UTCP lies immediately south and west of the
cultural traditions of the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV), and shares some cultural
traits with the region. Yet the coastal margin and inland cultural adaptations of the
UTCP have distinct characteristics which separate the region from the LMV. Like
most of their LMV neighbors, UTCP groups continued using pottery through contact
with Europeans and Euro-Americans (Figure 2.1). Yet in contrast, UTCP groups
continued their hunter-gatherer adaptation while some LMV culturesâmainly the
Caddoâshifted to horticulture. There is evidence among some other LMV groups of
cultigen use (corn/beans/squash), and wild starchy seeds (Kidder 2002; Kidder and
Fritz 1993), although it is not clear how important these plant foods were to LMV
inhabitants prior to AD 700 (approximately 1600 B.P.; Kidder 1992). Village
settlements are known in the Woodland era LMV, suggesting that some LMV
populations had high degrees of sedentariness. Elaborate mortuary practices and
interregional trade networks suggest social stratification and complex
economic/political systems.
While some aspects of UTCP hunter-fisher-gatherer adaptations are known,
others are not as well understood. In particular the degree of mobility and the nature of
mobility patterns of groups occupying this area are not fully known. Some aspects of
subsistence are well documented, while othersâsuch as the nature and significance of
plant useâare not. While there is no tradition of building ceremonial mounds on the

18
UTCP, it is possible that some of the items associated with burials may be
implicated in ceremonial behavior associated with acquiring social/political prestige.
The ceramic-era culture histories of the LMV and UTCP are summarized in this
chapter, with details on subsistence, mobility, and social stratification in these regions,
and pottery developments which might relate to these factors.
The succeeding sections of this chapter outline the basic cultural developments
of cultural areas adjacent to the UTCP: the northern and southern portions of the
Lower Mississippi Valley including the Caddo cultural area. Then the culture history
of the UTCP coastal margin and inland areas is presented, followed by a brief culture
history of the central Texas coastal margin, which has some cultural traits in common
with the UTCP. The chapter ends with a review of the âAkokisaâ model of cultural
evolution on the UTCP which guides most of the work done in the region to date.

Lower Mississippi Valley
The prehistoric cultures of the area known as the Lower Mississippi Valley
(LMV) occupied an area which stretches from what is now central Arkansas south to
coastal Louisiana. It is hypothesized that early LMV pottery traditions diffused slowly
from the Atlantic southeast, where the earliest wares are dated to 4,500 B.P.
(Sassaman 1993; Walthall 1980). Cultural adaptations throughout the region had
varying degrees of sedentariness, plant use, and social/political/economic complexity
(as evidenced by trade networks, earthworks, and mortuary practices). Archaeologists
working in the area hypothesize that by 3000 BC (roughly 4,500 B.P.), groups in the
LMV engaged in seasonal subsistence rounds and had base camps where they were
sedentary for at least part of the annual cycle (Jeter et al. 1989). The archaeological
record in the northern portion of the LMV indicates that northern LMV cultures used
starchy/oily seeds and developed a strong reliance on maize by the Mississippian
Period. Use of cultigens and starchy seeds, conceptually linked with other cultural
developments in the American Midwest and Southeast, is less evident throughout the
ceramic periods on the coastal portions of the LMV. Evidence of hierarchical social

19
ranking varied between cultural periods and regions throughout the LMV, but
appears to be generally greater in the northern LMV and trans-Mississippi South.

Northern Lower Mississippi Valley
By AD 600-1000 (roughly 1400-1000 B.P./Plum Bayou Culture) sites in
southeastern Arkansas contain hickory nuts and acorns, as well as starchy seeds such
as chenopod, maygrass, knotweed, sumpweed, and little barley. Bottle gourd is present
in some sites, as well as maize kernels (Rolingson 2002). In northeastern Arkansas
around AD 1000-1500 (approximately 1,000-500 B.P.), Mississippian people
consumed maize, starchy seeds and nuts (Jeter and Williams 1989).
Mississippian cultural occupations were typified by high population
concentrations in single locations, some of which were fortified with palisades.
Cultures in eastern and northwest Mississippi (Baytown Period/culture) built villages
clustered around mounds. By the protohistoric period, some groups in the northern
portion of the LMV were highly sedentary. The arrangement of houses in rows in
Mississippian villages in this area indicates community planning. Storage pits are
common features in the archaeological record, which suggests that populations may
have been sedentary for at least part of the annual cycle (Jeter and Williams 1989).
In contrast to the central and southern LMV, the northern portion of the Valley
has yielded more evidence of contact with the Midwest (i.e., Hopewell and Cahokia
cultures) in the form of exotic trade goods such as mica and copper cutouts, galena,
and items with raptorial bird designs. Microblade and core technology, hoes, chunky
stones, and shared pottery types indicate influence from Cahokia and other areas north
of Arkansas. Mississippian groups in the northern LMV were involved in trade of
shell-tempered pottery, non-local chert, galena, copper, and marine shell. Pyramidshaped mounds were arranged around central plazas, suggesting large ceremonial
activities. By AD 1500, the northern portion of the LMV was still the site of
Mississippian culture, with nucleated settlements with palisades and maize cultivation.

20
Exotic trade goods such as marine shell, salt, exotic cherts from the Midwest,
copper and galena are present in some sites from this time period (Jeter 1989).

Trans-Mississippi South
To the north and west of the central and southern LMV (in what is now
western Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, northwest Louisiana, and northeast Texas) the
Fourche Maline culture (ca. 300 BC-AD 800) occupied what eventually became the
Caddoan homeland. By about AD 800 (approximately 900 B.P.), the Fourche Maline
culture had transitioned to the distinct Caddo culture (Figure 2.2). Generally, Fourche
Maline material was characterized by bone, sand, and grog-tempered pottery, Gary
dart points, hoe-type tools, boatstones, platform pipes, and large amounts of grinding
stones (Jeter et al. 1989; Schambach 2002). There is not much direct evidence for
starchy/oily seed use or maize horticulture, although it is not clear if this is a result of
prehistoric people not using these resources or a bias in flotation recovery techniques
(Schambach 2002). The hoes (sometimes referred to as âdouble-bitted axesâ) may
have been used for cultivating, and the large amounts of grinding implements suggest
heavy use of plant foods. Fourche Maline villages have large, deep midden deposits
which indicate they were occupied for long periods of time. There is no evidence of
storage pits (Schambach 2002). Fourche Maline groups buried selected individuals in
mounds, and in the latter part of this cultural period, burials contained ornaments made
from human and animal bone, cremations, and boat stones. There was no evidence of
trade with Marksville cultures to the south.
Like their Mississippian counterparts, the Caddo cultivated maize and other
tropical cultigens (although there is little or no information on plant use between AD
700 and AD 1000; about 1300-1000 B.P.). Both societies had hierarchical social
structures (as indicated by non-local grave goods), and an intense ritual and
ceremonial life as evidenced by mound-based civic and ceremonial centers (Perttula
1992). Although the Caddo did engage in warfare, Caddo villages did not have
palisades as Mississippian centers did. Instead, Caddoan ceremonial centers appeared

21
to be relatively unoccupied while most of the population lived in dispersed
farmsteads along river valleys. In addition to maize, squash, and gourds, the Caddo
utilized wild foods including nuts, wild starchy seeds (including maygrass, amaranth,
chenopods, and sunflower), deer and a wide variety of other wild fauna. Caddoan
groups were engaged with long-distance trade as well; marine shell, effigy pipes and
large crystals of quartz, galena, bauxite and glauconite were present in Caddo graves.
Other grave goods included arrow points, bifaces, knives, and celts, and finely made
pottery (Perttula 1992). The presence of ceramic types common to the LMV, Plains
and Texas in Caddoan sites indicate exchange of pottery and/or ideas. The Caddoan
Spiro mound complex in eastern Oklahoma has evidence of trade with Cahokia (Jeter
and Williams 1989). Interaction between Caddoan and Mississippian groups peaked
during this period of time, as evidenced by similar styles of pottery, house styles and
mound construction techniques. Skeletal analyses indicate that by AD 1100-1300
Caddoan consumption of maize was quite high (Perttula 1992). On the eve of contact
with Europeans the Caddo were also engaged in extensive trade networks reaching
west to New Mexico, north to the Arkansas River, and south to the Gulf of Mexico.
By contact, the Caddo were trading locally procured salt and bow wood along with
horses, Native American slaves from the Plains and Southwest, and finely made
pottery (Jeter 1989; Perttula 1992). While they continued to cultivate maize and beans
at contact, Caddo settlements became dispersed, burial mounds were used less, and
burials contained fewer grave goods (Jeter 1989).

Southern Lower Mississippi Valley
Southern LMV cultures often did not develop nucleated settlements or planned
communities like many groups in the northern LMV. In coastal sites throughout the
ceramic periods, the presence of Rangia cuneata (clam), various sizes of mammals,
and fish have been interpreted to indicate that coastal groups relied more heavily on
wild resources and maintained a more mobile settlement pattern relative to their
northern neighbors (Jeter et al. 1989). Information on wild and domesticate plant use

22
on the coastal portion of the LMV is limited. Some gourd seeds have been
documented in Tchefuncte Period (Figure 2.2) contexts, but information on other
domesticated plant foods is lacking (Jeter et al. 1989; Kidder 2002). In the Marskville
Period (Figure 2.2) evidence of wild plants has been found, there is no evidence of
starchy seeds or cultigens (Jeter et al. 1989; Kidder and Fritz 1993; Kidder 2002). The
Late Prehistoric cultures of central and eastern Louisiana (Plaquemine) showed very
little evidence of maize cultivation or consumption (Figure 2.2). Locations of
Plaquemine Period settlements on both fertile natural levees with well-drained soils
and estuarine locations lead some researchers to hypothesize that coastal groups were
aggregated in sedentary settlements on the levees for horticultural activities and then
dispersed for seasonal fishing and shellfishing activities. Whether inland Plaquemine
groups actually cultivated plants is unknown (Jeter and Williams 1989).
At time of contact, sites in the coastal area of Louisiana have little evidence of
plant cultivation, long-distance trade, and social ranking. There is evidence that
Mississippian groups from Florida and the Northern LMV moved into the area
bringing concepts of horticulture and social ranking (Jeter and Williams 1989). Inland
groups used some maize, cucurbita, chenopodium, knotweed, and amaranth. Some
historic groups such as the Tansa, Natchez, and Houma cultivated maize and beans
and consumed wild nuts.
Evidence of earthworks and interregional exchange, often implicated with
some level of social/political economic complexity, are present mostly at sites in the
inland portion of the southern LMV. The earthworks and interregional exchange
system of Poverty Point are most notable during the period of 1700-500 BC
(approximately 3,500-2,500 B.P.), although mound building activity in the LMV and
greater American Southeast dates earlier than Poverty Point (e.g., Russo 1994;
Saunders et al. 2005). Material culture consists primarily of dart points typologically
similar to those found in large portions of what are now Louisiana, Arkansas,
southeastern Oklahoma, and southeastern Texas (Jeter et al. 1989). Pottery with a
variety of temper types/inclusions was present at Poverty Point, and perhaps earlier

23
(Gibson and Melancon 2004). The decline of Poverty Point as a center of longdistance exchange coincided with a lessening of trade throughout the region (Jeter et
al. 1989).
Hopewell-style cordmarked, paddle-stamped, and fabric impressed pottery
types (e.g., Mazique Incised, Baytown Plain, and Coles Creek Incised) in southern
LMV burials and domestic ceramic assemblages suggest contact with Hopewell
culture in the Midwest. Other Hopewell trade goods such as mica cutouts and copper
are rare in southern LMV sites, leading researchers to question the idea of direct
contact between Hopewell and Marksville cultures (Jeter et al. 1989; Kidder 2002).
Burial customs of inland groups were characteristic of Hopewell, such as mass burials
in conical mounds with grave goods, may indicate social stratification as all members
of society appear to be buried in this manner (Jeter et al. 1989). Ceremonial behavior
in inland and coastal Plaquemine cultures (Figure 2.2) is evident in mortuary features,
which include burials in charnel houses (wooden structures often built on mounds and
used to house human remains). Mortuary ceremonialism appeared to be elaborate in
some cases (Jeter and Williams 1989). Coastal burials from all time periods lack grave
goods, which has been interpreted to mean a lack of social stratification. Between AD
1100 and 1200 Cahokia (roughly 800 BP)âa major center of complexity and
interregional interaction in the Midwestâ reached a cultural zenith. While
contemporaneous cultures in central and eastern Louisiana had settlements with a
Mississippian-style layout of nucleated settlements around mounds, it is unknown if
there was communication between Mississippian, Coles Creek and Cahokia cultures.

Upper Texas Coastal Plain
The upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP) is located in a physical environment
similar to that in which the cultures of the Lower Mississippi Valley were situated, and
was culturally linked to these groups through shared pottery types (Aten 1983; Ensor
and Ricklis 1998; Walthall 1980; Wheat 1953; Figure 2.1). Paleoindian and Early

24
Archaic sites are rare on the landscape, probably because they do not resemble later
sites. Early sites may not be visible because they are under water from Holocene sea
level rise and/or stream prograding, which buried them under alluvium (Aten 1983;
Ricklis 2004a).

Archaic Period: Coastal Margin
The Archaic Period on the UTCP coastal margin was characterized by
preceramic shell midden occupations dating as early as 4,500 B.P. Shell middens (sites
whose matrix is primarily shell) and shell-bearing sites (those with relatively small
amounts of shell) are found dating throughout the remainder of the prehistoric record,
and often contain numerous faunal remains but little botanical material. UTCP
Archaic middens contain dart point styles typical of Archaic Period sites across Texas,
especially of the inland northeastern portion of the state. Lithics are the most common
artifact on Archaic Period sites, yet they are scarce throughout the UTCP, making the
preceramic chronology somewhat nebulous (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). What is known
is that the Archaic Period, divided into the Early Lithic Period (7000-4000 BC),
Middle Lithic Period (4000-1000 BC) and Late Lithic Period (1000-300 BC); was
characterized by distinct dart point styles commonly found in other cultural regions of
Texas and the LMV (Jeter et al. 1989; Ricklis 2004a; Story 1990b). Most lithics from
the UTCP are usually classified as nonlocal cherts from unspecified locations. Local
stone varies considerably in composition and utility for knapping (Ensor 1995). Local
sources included quartzites and petrified wood from Trinity River and San Jacinto
River gravel deposits, and possibly alligator gastroliths (Aten 1983; Ensor and Ricklis
1998). Higher quality stone was often from non-local sources (Ensor and Ricklis
1998). Lithics from the Middle Lithic Period were often made from Edwards Plateau
chert cobbles from the lower Colorado River, and possibly the Brazos and Guadalupe
River drainages (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). At some sites such as Eagles Ridge
(41CH252), Late Archaic raw material quality became relatively poorer compared to
the Middle Lithic Period, as people used more local resources and smaller pieces of

25
material (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). It has been speculated that perhaps high reliance
on local lithic resources indicates stringent social boundaries (Ensor and Ricklis
1998).
The mobility pattern(s) of Archaic Period populations are not clear. On the
UTCP, microstructural analysis of shell growth rings on the brackish water clam
Rangia cuneata from archaeological sites have commonly been used to estimate
season of occupation. Occupations often appear to be late spring/early summer. At
Eagles Ridge, Middle Lithic Period shellfish data indicate a winter/spring occupation,
while late Lithic Period data suggest a shift to strictly spring season gathering (Ensor
and Ricklis 1998). Some upland delta sites such as Eagles Ridge may have been used
to take advantage of upland resources at times when lowland areas were inaccessible
due to spring flooding in the delta (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). Research by Aten (1999)
indicates that seasonality data may be problematic, as Rangia cuneata have
environmentally driven growth, and may be responding to temperature changes not
linked with seasonal change. Fish otoliths indicate that Eagles Ridge was occupied
year round during the Middle Archaic Period, with an emphasis on spring/summer and
fall, which has been interpreted to mean that people were relying on a broad base of
resources (Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
It has been suggested that sites become more frequent on the landscape in the
Late Archaic (Aten 1983; Ricklis 2004a). Late Archaic occupations at such as that at
the Harris County Boys School site (41HR80 and 41HR85) have more dense cultural
material in Late Archaic compared to Middle Archaic occupations. Compared to the
nonlocal lithic raw materials common in Middle Archaic sites, Late Archaic sites lithic
raw materials frequently consist of local pebbles, suggesting that coastal populations
traveled and/or traded less frequently to obtain lithic raw materials (Ensor and Ricklis
1998). Archaic Period cemeteries are not known on the coastal margin (Aten 1983).

26
Archaic Period: Inland Area
In contrast to coastal margin Archaic Period sites, inland Archaic Period sites
typically had little faunal or botanical material. Lithic assemblages included dart point
types common to northeastern and southeastern Texas. However, East Texas point
styles such as Palmer, Johnson, Graham Cave and Big Sandy are not present on the
UTCP (Ricklis 2004a; Story 1990b). Site types include low density artifact scatters on
pimple mounds, which have been argued to be short duration hunting camps (Moore
1995). Other inland sites had preceramic and ceramic components, suggesting long
periods of occupation, which may indicate high residential stability despite
technological changes over time in lithics and ceramics (Moore 1995). Large base
camp-type sites in inland settings suggest to some researchers that perhaps there was
an inland adaptation distinct from the coastal margin (Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
Archaic cemeteries were present in the southwestern portion of the inland UTCP, and
sometimes contained more than 200 individuals. Nonlocal items such as corner-tang
knives made from Edwards Plateau chert, boatstones from southwestern Arkansas, and
marine shell ornaments occurred as grave goods in burials between 700 BC and AD
400 (roughly 2500-2400 B.P.), leading Hall (1981) to propose that there was
interaction between the inland coastal plain groups and others on the coastal margin,
Edwards Plateau in Central Texas, and LMV groups during this time period (Hall
1981).

Ceramic Period: Coastal Margin 485/70 BC-AD 500
Pottery appears on the coastal margin of the UTCP somewhere between 485
and 70 BC (Aten 1983; Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Figure 2.2). Early UTCP pottery
resembled Lower Mississippi Valley Tchefuncte and Mandeville wares in decoration
and construction. Thus, archaeologists have speculated that pottery appeared on the
UTCP as the result of westward movement of people and/or ideas from the lower
Mississippi Valley, and was possibly maintained as a technological tradition by smallscale interaction with Lower Mississippi Valley cultures (Ensor and Ricklis 1998;

27
Moore 1995; Patterson 1993). How rapidly the technology was adapted is also a
matter of speculation; ceramic vessel technology may have been adopted gradually,
although the dates of the early ceramic component of Eagles Ridge (41CH252)
overlap with similar Tchefuncte and Mandeville wares in the Lower Mississippi
Valley. The similarities indicate little if any time lag between the use of the wares in
the LMV and their adoption on the UTCP (Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Ricklis 2004a).
Roughly during this time span, the well-known Tchefuncte culture in the
central and southern portions of the Early Woodland LMV (Tchula period: 600/500100 BC/AD 1, roughly 2,550-2,100 B.P.) was characterized by Kent dart points, clay
balls similar to Poverty Point objects, and middens of the brackish water clam Rangia
cuneata. Tchefuncte pottery is distinctive artifact of this cultural area and time period.
Tchefuncte Plain pottery has been described as low-fired, poorly wedged, contorted
paste with silt and silt-size quartz grains, a small amount of fine sand, and incidental
inclusions of vegetal matter and hematite nodules (Ford and Quimby 1945).
Decoration techniques include incising, rocker stamping, dentate stamping, fluting,
drag and jab incising, pinching and punctuating, and cord impressing (Ensor and
Ricklis 1998). Vessels commonly have podal base supports (Gertjejansen and Shenkel
1983). UTCP Tchefuncte-style ceramics do not have the sculpted bases characteristic
of the LMV Tchefuncte, but they are otherwise similar in paste and decorative
techniques (Ensor and Ricklis1998). Mandeville wares were commonly tempered with
coarse sand, and were poorly smoothed, deep bowl and jar forms with flattened to
slightly rounded bases. This early pottery was replaced by a local undecorated sandy
paste ware known as Goose Creek Plain by about AD 200 (approximately 1800 B.P.).
The pastes of Goose Creek wares were more thoroughly worked than Tchefuncte and
Mandeville pottery. Tchefuncte wares appear to have dropped out of the UTCP record
by the Clear Lake Period (AD 425; Table 2.1). Early UTCP ceramics were originally
thought to occur in low densities (Aten 1983) but the large volume of pottery
recovered from the Eagles Ridge site suggest that ceramic-making was quickly wellestablished in the UTCP (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). Marksville wares, common in the

28
LMV during this period, were non-existent in the UTCPâexcept for small amounts
of Marksville sherds in the Sabine Lake area (Ricklis 2004a). Although UTCP pottery
types became more distinct from LMV types, the local ceramic typology commonly
used in the UTCP is modeled on Phillipsâ 1970 typology for the Lower Mississippi
Valley, which emphasizes paste types (Aten 1983).
The transition from the Archaic to Early Ceramic Period was also marked by a
shift from Kent to Gary dart points. Socketed bone points characteristic of LMV Late
Woodland Period cultures (such as Troyville and Coles Creek, Figure 2.2) were
present in the Clear Lake through Turtle Bay Periods (Table 2.1). Lithics in early
ceramic occupations indicate an emphasis on conserving raw materials (by reworking
bifaces) and focusing on local raw materials from the Trinity, San Jacinto and Brazos
River valleys (Ensor 1995). Distinct Galveston Bay area cemeteries have led some to
infer that groups began to establish distinct social boundaries just after the Clear Lake
Period, instead of during the Round Lake Period as originally posited by Aten (Ensor
and Ricklis 1998).

Ceramic Period: Coastal Margin AD 500- AD 1528
The Late Ceramic Period on the coastal margin began with the appearance of
expanding stem-style Alba, Catahoula, and Scallorn arrow points around AD 700
during the Turtle Bay Period (Ricklis 2004a; Table 2.1). By AD 1200 or 1300, Perdiz
points, bifacial knives, and drills were common in coastal lithic assemblages, which
some researchers link with the return of bison to the coastal prairies at this time (see
environmental section and Dillehay 1974; Ricklis 2004a). While the coastal margin of
the UTCP has LMV ceramic types and differential distribution of grave goods (see
below), the trajectory of cultural change on the UTCP does not follow that of many
other Southeastern groups (Story 1990b). UTCP groups never developed ceramic
assemblages with high frequencies of cord and fabric-impressions, burial mounds, or
the stratified social organization common to the Woodland Period (1000 BC-AD 950,
roughly 2800-1200 B.P.). By AD 800, local Mississippian cultural manifestations,

29
including long-distance exchange and maize-beans-squash horticulture appear
among the Caddoan groups in what are now Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and East
Texas. In contrast to the Woodland and Mississippian cultural developments
throughout much of the Southeast, subsistence on the UTCP appears to remain
focused on the terrestrial and littoral resources commonly appearing in Archaic Period
occupations.
There has been some disagreement over the formal term for describing ceramic
occupations; a fact which reflects the difficulty of placing what is essentially the
Archaic period with ceramic vessels into a cultural stage which articulates neatly with
cultural stages of the adjacent Lower Mississippi Valley and other Southeastern
cultural complexes. Occupations from all ceramic periods are typically referred to as
the âMossy Groveâ tradition (Story 1990b), commonly understood to be characterized
by undecorated sandy paste ceramics, Gary and Kent dart points, and Alba, Catahoula,
Perdiz, Scallorn, Agee, and Homan arrow points. These artifact types were common to
large portions of the western gulf coastal plain and inland south Texas (Aten 1983).
Some researchers have argued that âMossy Groveâ should really be linked with the
Woodland Period defined simultaneously in other parts of the Southeastern United
States, as UTCP pottery assemblages contain conidial shapes and cord marked surface
treatments common in other areas of the Woodland Southeast (Aten 1983; Schafer
1975). Ensor and Carlson (1988) point out that the incised and punctated motifs
present on some UTCP pottery most closely resemble Gulf Formational Period
assemblages further east on the Gulf Coastal Plain. Some changes in ceramics
occurred in the Late Prehistoric Period; grog temper becomes very common in
ceramics around AD 1000 at the end of the Turtle Bay Period (Aten 1983; Table 2.1),
and vessels with Coles Creek-Plaquemine designs appear on some sites (Ricklis
2004a). Rockport, a Late Prehistoric ceramic type with characteristic asphaltum
surface treatments has been documented on upper Texas coastal and inland sites (Ellis
1995; Ricklis 1994; Figure 2.2).

30
Researchers working in the area have argued that higher populations can be
inferred during the Late Prehistoric Period, as barrier island sites such as Mitchell
Ridge around AD700/800 showed signs of increasingly dense occupations (Aten
1983; Ricklis 2004a). Burials in coastal cemeteries like Mitchell Ridge had varying
amounts of grave goods, including engraved bird bone whistles, and beads made from
shell and bird bone. In addition to rising populations, Ricklis has argued that social
complexity can be inferred from the distribution of grave goods in the four prehistoric
cemeteries at Mitchell Ridge (Ricklis 1994). At this site, the cemeteries were
contemporaneous, but one clearly had more grave offerings per burial than the others.
Ricklis argues that the distribution of grave goods supports the idea that some
members of this society were spatially set apart from others, indicating ranking within
the group.

Ceramic Period: Inland Area
By AD 500 pottery appeared on the inland portions of the UTCP (Ricklis
2004a; Figure 2.2), later than it did on the coastal margin. Early assemblages were
sand-tempered, but by AD 1000 grog temper was common in ceramic assemblages
throughout the coastal and inland UTCP. Some bone tempered wares were present on
inland sites as well (Ricklis 2004a). Pottery in the northeastern portion of the inland
UTCP was reported to have some stylistic similarities to Caddo wares, including
brushed and punctuate designs. These design similarities could indicate contact
between UTCP inland and Caddo groups (Ricklis 2004a). Around AD 600/700, the
bow and arrow appeared. In the northeastern portion of the inland UTCP, Gary points
and ceramics were found together, and in the later portion of the Ceramic Period Alba,
Catahoula, and Perdiz arrow points were present (Ricklis 2004a). In the southwestern
portion of the UTCP (near the lower portion of the Brazos River), Gary, Ensor, and
Godley dart points were present and Scallorn arrow points appeared later in the
ceramic period.

31
Inland Ceramic Period sites had few faunal remains, although deer, raccoon,
turtle, and fish remains were sometimes present. Ethnohistoric accounts claimed that
some groups in the northeastern portion of the UTCP cultivated maize (1993). Sites
were often located on uplands overlooking river valleys, leading Moore (1995) to
hypothesize that inland groups were most likely tethered to waterways for
transportation, potable water, and food resources such as fish, reptiles, and mediumsmall animals. Moore hypothesizes that inland peoples dispersed into small groups
during the warm seasons, and aggregated into larger groups during the cold season. As
population increased, large bands were forced to fission, allowing social organization
of lineage-based bands to remain the same. Each of these social units generated a
series of sites in varying categories that would reflect a seasonal round arrayed along
stream channels, which in time came to reflect social boundaries (Moore 1995).
Moore further hypothesizes that transhumance may not have occurred b/t the inland
and coastal zones of the UTCP. As noted previously, a study of human remains noted
higher frequencies of treponematosis (a result of endemic and venereal syphilis, and
yaws) among individuals interred in coastal margin cemeteries compared to those
from inland cemeteries, and that this trend did not change through time. It is inferred
that coastal populations were denser and more spatially constrained than inland
populations (Wilson 2001).

Historic Period
The Historic Period on the coastal margin began with the shipwreck of Ãlvar
NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza deVaca and crew members of the Navarro Expedition in November
1528. Originally looking for the mouth of the Mississippi River, the expeditionâs ships
were blown off course by a storm. Some of the crew landed on an island whose
description is similar to Galveston Island. Cabeza deVaca, in his attempts to return to
previously established Spanish settlements in New Spain, traveled throughout coastal
and inland Texas and Mexico for nine years. His account of the journey provides the

32
earliest ethnohistoric account of native life on the UTCP. Other European explorers
followed. Simars deBellisle, part of an expedition headed to Louisiana, landed in
Galveston Bay in 1719 and was taken captive after he and four other people went
ashore and were left by their party. DeBellisle traveled to the San Jacinto River and
met natives on an island in Galveston Bay and traveled with them as a slave/servant,
after the death of his travel companions. The establishment of New Orleans in 1718
brought French traders into contact with UTCP native groups. Trader Joseph
Blancpain traded furs with natives starting in 1729; a French trading post was
established in the UTCP area in 1754. This interaction between UTCP natives and the
French provided some historical documentation of trade not only between natives and
Europeans, but between native groups.
Moore has suggested that European accounts of trade between native groups
indicate that native groups were trying to maintain their traditional adaptations (Moore
1995). He points out that the Akokisa remained hunter-gatherers, even when their
Caddo neighbors did not, and suggests that the Akokisa traditionally traded meat for
agricultural products and littoral resources for lithic raw materials (Moore 1995). An
ethnohistoric account mentions Atakapan groups trading smoked fish, marine shell,
moss, tar, and feathers with Caddoan groups for lithic raw materials, bow wood, and
pottery (Kniffen et al. 1987). Interestingly, historic Atakapan groups are described in
this account as making little pottery themselves. Even though they apparently knew
how to make it, they preferred to trade with the Karankawa for it. Other ethnohistoric
accounts describe Karankawa trading for sea shells (usually conch) and a bean-like
fruit (possibly mesquite pods) for skins, cane, and ochre (Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
The Spanish tried to counteract the French presence by establishing Presidio de
San Augustine de Ahumada near what is now the town of Anahuac at the mouth of the
Trinity River, and Mission Nuestra Senora de la Luz del Orcoquisac, on Trinity Bay in
1756. The Mission Period (AD 1720-1771) was short-lived and effectively ended with
the abandonment of the presidio and the mission (Aten 1983). Euro-American
settlement of the inland area began somewhere between 1823 and 1825, when a group

33
of settlers led by Stephen Austin obtained land grants from the Mexican
government to settle in along the lower Brazos River in the modern counties of Fort
Bend and Brazoria. By AD 1840, natives of the UTCP are rarely mentioned in period
accounts (see Moore and Donachie 2001 for one exception). Archaeologists infer that
this decrease in native populations is largely due to mortality from introduced diseases
from the time of initial contact with Europeans, and movement associated with
dislocation of UTCP and adjacent groups (Moore and Donachie 2001).

Central Texas Coastal Margin
The cultural area of the central Texas coastal margin extends from
approximately south of the upper Texas coastal plain around Matagorda Bay to the
northern shore of Baffin Bay (Ricklis 2004b; Figure 2.1). The earliest unequivocal
evidence of human habitation is dated to about 7500 B.P. Early occupations consist of
thin but dense layers of oyster (Crassotrea virginica); some shells appear to be
modified into knife-like tools. There were few other faunal remains. Artifacts found
on the surface of the shell layers included Uvlade and Gower dart points, and flakes.
Shoreline occupation during the period of 5800-4200 B.P. was marked by Rangia
flexuosa middens, fish otoliths, and an array of Archaic Period dart points including
Gower, Tortugas, Bell, and early triangular-style points. A set of postmolds has been
documented on one site (Ricklis 2004b). Seasonal analyses of oyster shell from Early
Archaic middens indicated a winter-spring occupation. There are no sites documented
for the time period between 4200 and 3100 B.P., except for a possible oyster scatter
with no associated artifacts (Ricklis 2004b). Sites became common on the landscape
between 3100 and 950 B.P., starting about the time sea level stabilized at the modern
level around 3000 B.P. (Ricklis 2004b). Shell middens dating to this Late Archaic
Period contained Catan, Kent, Godley, and Matamoros dart points, as well as knives,
scrapers, and bone tools. Shell tools, often made from conch shell were common.
Faunal material, especially fish and deer bone, were more frequent than in earlier sites.
Analyses of growth rings on oyster shell indicate that shell midden sites were occupied

34
winter through spring. Ricklis (2004b) has reported one cemetery possibly dating to
the Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric Period began around AD 1000 (about 1000 B.P.) with the
appearance of plain, sandy paste pottery and Fresno and Scallorn arrow points. By AD
1250/1300 Perdiz arrow points and asphaltum-coated (tarred) pottery appear on the
coastal margin, forming a distinctive cultural period known as Rockport. Notched rims
and bowl, jar, and olla forms are common in Rockport ceramic assemblages. Rockport
wares are found as far north as southern Galveston Bay. The geographical distribution
of Rockport extends from the immediate shoreline to 40 kilometers inland. In addition
to asphaltum-coated pottery, the Rockport Period was distinguished by unifacial
scrapers, bifacial knives, drills, prismatic blades, ceramic pipes coated with asphaltum,
bone points, awls, bird bone beads, and shell tools. The Rockport lithic assemblage
was similar to that of Toyah groups living more than 40 kilometers inland. Toyah
potteryâusually classified in Texas typologies as Leon Plainâis not coated with
asphaltum, and has high frequencies on bone temper. Rockport is associated with the
historic Karankawa culture. Ethnohistoric accounts describe Karankawa groups living
in large fall/winter season camps on the shoreline, and then dispersing into smaller
inland camps in the spring and summer (Ricklis 2004b).

Akokisa Model
The longstanding and influential model of cultural evolution on the UTCP is
Atenâs âAkokisa Modelâ (Aten 1983; Table 2.1). Aten created the model working
backward from historic period population estimates and early historic accounts of
population aggregation and dispersal. Historically, UTCP groups were observed to
aggregate in villages of 400-500 persons in the winter months, and disperse into bandsized groups in the warm season. Aten hypothesizes that population gradually
increased through time, and large village groups began to fission when they had over
450 members. During the Late Archaic Period, groups expanded into unoccupied

35
spaces on the landscape while they maintained a fairly stable archaic tool kit
(without pottery).
Aten argues that during the period of AD 100-AD 800 there were changes in
UTCP subsistence and social organization. People developed or adopted technologies
designed to extract more energetic returns from food resources: pottery, bow and
arrow, and fish weirs (Table 2.1). There is no remaining physical evidence of fish
weirs, although weirs were mentioned in ethnohistoric accounts on the UTCP and the
LMV coasts (Aten 1983; Jeter 1989). Mortuary practices changed as well, as burials
become visible on the landscape during the Mayes Island Period (AD 425-600). Aten
interprets changes in technology as indicators of subsistence change. He argues that as
populations grew and groups became more packed on the landscape, competition for
resources increased. Aten interprets the appearance of cemeteries during the Turtle
Bay Period (AD 650-1000) as indicators of increasing territoriality where cemeteries
marked the locations to which members of particular groups were closely tied.
Increases in population and territoriality led to a subsequent reduction of foraging
ranges, which in turn affected the availability of large-bodied resources. As a result,
people used a wider range of small-bodied species as their resource procurement range
decreased. As a result of reduced foraging ranges, groups become more sedentary. The
period between AD 800-1700 marked increased innovation in ceramic design and
expansion of bow and arrow use, which might have increased hunting efficiency to
counter declining return rates. Aten admits that the increased use of the bow and arrow
in the historic period could also have been a result of the return of bison to the area
and the burgeoning fur trade with Europeans, rather than an indication of more
efficient capture of small-bodied prey (Aten 1983).
The Akokisa model is used in various modified forms in the region today. For
example, other researchers have hypothesized that as groups became less mobile, they
may have increased their focus on littoral resources. Separate settlement systems for
the inland and the coast may have been in place by the end of the Late Archaic, most

36
likely due to population increase, which in turn increased socio-political complexity
and participation in regional economic spheres within the inland and coastal margin
areas (Ensor 1998). Ceramic vessels are implicated in this family of models in several
ways. Pots are interpreted as markers of technological change in response to the
changing availability in resources due to territorial packing of the landscape. They are
also visible links of contact and/or trade with other cultural regions with documented
archaeological and historic records of long-distance trade, warfare, large earthworks,
elaborate ceremonial behavior, and social ranking. In other words, the presence of
ceramic vessels on the UTCP continues to be used to infer a semi-sedentary to
sedentary hunter-gatherer adaptation with high population densities, limited mobility,
and exclusive rights to food resources and in some cases food production and/or an
increasingly intensive reliance on wild plants (Moore 1995; Story 1985, 1990b).
Design styles similar to those found on LMV wares have been used to infer UTCP
participation in regional trade, and complex structures of social organization (Aten
1983; Ricklis 2004a).
UTCP vessels appear in contexts that make their roles in food production and
storage unclear. Their functions remain unknown, although their presence is
frequently used to interpret site function (Moore 1995). Researchers have speculated
about vessel function among UTCP hunter-gatherers. Pots may have functioned as
generalized tools used for a variety of tasks (Ellis 1995; Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
Other ideas of function include rendering grease, direct cooking (Ensor and Ricklis
1998), indirect cooking (Ellis 1995), tar processing, processing and storage of plant
products (Moore 1995), and general storage and transport of goods, including
foodstuffs (Moore 1995). More generally UTCP adaptations still are not well
understood. While most (if not all) groups in this area do not appear to have engaged
in food production or long-term storage, the extent and nature of food storage in this
region is not known. Like some groups living in the coastal portions of the LMV,
UTCP foragers may have depended little on starchy seeds, or they could have

37
depended on them quite heavily like many other Eastern Woodland Period
populations in the American Southeast.

Did Geography and Climate Affect Cultural Change?
The upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP) is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province. The region is comprised of wedges of sediment which have
been deposited by river activity since the Cretaceous (65 mya). These sediments dip
gently seaward at an angle of five feet or less per mile. Thus, the region has little
topographic relief (Spearing 1991). The highest areas lie in the northeastern and
central portions where elevation averages 500 feet above sea level. Modern climate on
the UTCP is characterized as humid subtropical with warm to hot summers. Annual
rainfall ranges from 56 inches near the Sabine River to 37 inches near the Brazos
River, and peaks in the summer and winter months (Swanson 1995). Tropical
disturbances (including hurricanes) are common and have been known to produce
more than ten inches of rain in a 24 hour period. Hurricane season lasts from June
through November, peaking June through September. Since the beginning of modern
recordkeeping in 1871, the Texas coast has averaged one hurricane every other year,
with the longest recorded gap between storms being nine years (Swanson 1995). Not
only are these storms a physical threat, but they also significantly alter the
environment. Storm surges can reach up to 30 miles inland and submerge portions of
the landscape. Storm activity can also close tidal passes, open new ones, and change
sedimentation rates in bays and estuaries.
Due to the paucity of the pollen-bearing locations (e.g., lakes, bogs, caves) on
the UTCP, the primary source of information on long-term environmental change in
the area is the hydro-geologic record. By 20,000 B.P. (Late Wisconsin), glacial ice
was at its maximum thickness and the Gulf shoreline ranged as far as 160 kilometers
south of its present location (Lewis 2000). Starting after 18,000 B.P. sea level rose
rapidly as a result of deglaciation. Rivers downcut as they carried increased amounts
of meltwater to a low sea level. Dates on foraminifera from offshore sediments and

shell from barrier islands indicate that the Gulf experienced several stages of
eustatic sea level rise as the result of major climatic changes. These rises occurred in a
stepwise fashion. At the onset of deglaciation, sea level on the Gulf rose rapidly until
about 10,000 B.P. when the shoreline stabilized. This stillstand was followed by
another rapid rise ending in another stillstand between 8700 and 7000 B.P. Another
rapid rise occurred after 7000 B.P. and another stillstand around 6000 B.P.; after
another period of rapid rise, the modern stillstand was achieved somewhere between
5000 and 2000 B.P. (estimates vary, see Lewis 2000; Ricklis and Blum 1997; Ricklis
2004b, Ricklis 2005). Overall sea level rise may explain in part the low number of
Early Archaic and Paleoindian Period sites, as many of these earlier sites should be
currently located offshore (Lewis 2000). (These older sites may also be subject to
subsidence resulting from modern oil, water and gas extraction on the UTCP.) Recent
work in the Lower Mississippi Valley drainage suggests that there were repeated
flooding events between 3000 and 2600 B.P. which affected human occupation of the
area (Brown and Kennett 1999; Kidder 2006). It is not currently known if the Texas
coastal plain was affected in a similar manner.
Pollen data from southern and central Texas are used to infer the vegetation
and climate history of the area (Story 1990a). Pollen taken from locations adjacent to
the UTCP indicate that between 22,000 and 14,000 B.P. central Texas was comprised
predominately of deciduous forest, while south Texas was composed of grasslands and
oak scrublands (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This is interpreted to indicate the climate
of these areas of the state were cooler and more humid than they are at present.
Between 14,000 and 10,000 B.P. pollen records from central Texas indicate a steady
decline of arboreal pollen and an increase in grass pollen, indicating a warming and
drying trend. Although east Texas has generated almost no pollen data (probably due
to poor preservation), pollen records from Louisiana at this time show a deciduous
woodland environment. From 10,000 B.P. to the present, south Texas has no pollen
records.

39
Analysis of charcoal from archaeological sites in the area suggests modern
species such as mesquite, willow, and pecan were in place by 6,000 B.P. In central
Texas, declines in arboreal pollen and increases in grass suggest a continuation of the
warming and drying trend. The oak-hickory mosaic characteristic of the present may
have been in place early in the postglacial period. Other estimates place the
appearance of modern vegetation closer to 1,500 B.P. or perhaps 3,000 B.P. (Bryant
and Holloway 1985). North Texas records suggest the possibility that the oak
savannah became established as early as 9,000 B.P. (Bryant and Holloway 1985). It is
possible also that modern seasonal conditions existed as early as 5500-4500 B.P. By
2500 B.P. modern biota are fully established on the Texas coastal plain (Story 1990a).
Limited pollen and faunal data indicate that climate may have fluctuated
during the last 2000 years (Beck et al. 2001; Dillehay 1974). Pollen records from the
one bog which has been cored in the UTCP indicate that around 1010 B.P. the area
had high amounts of grass, oak, and charcoal, although it is not clear if this is the
result of climate change or anthropogenic burning. Around 170 B.P. (European
contact) there appears to be an increase in arboreal pollen (Beck et al. 2001). The
changing presence and absence of bison remains in archaeological sites on the
southern and Gulf Coastal Plains have been interpreted to indicate that bison
experienced changes in their range and population density due to climatic shifts
(Dillehay 1974). Based on faunal data from selected sites, Dillehay argues that bison
were present on the southern plains between 10,000 and 6000/5000 BC, and then
absent between 6000/5000 and 2500 BC. Dillehay argues that this initial period of
absence correlates well with the Altithermal Period as characterized by Antevs 55002000 B.C., suggesting that grasslands may have been dessicated during a relatively
warm, dry climatic period. Bison reappear on archaeological sites present between
2500BC and AD 500 and are absent again between AD 500 and 1200/1300. Dillehay
notes that there was documented climatic change at the end of the 13th Century. He
argues that drought conditions in the Southwest indicate that bison may have moved
eastward to West Texas in the Llano Estacado area, north of the Lower Pecos Valley.

40
Bison are present on archaeological sites dating AD 1200/1300 or later, suggesting
that the coastal prairie intrudes and recedes between AD 500 and the historic period
(Stahl 1995).

Conclusions
People began using ceramic vessels on portions of the UTCP around 2000
B.P., much later than in other areas of the Southeastern United States. Pottery use on
the inland upper coast and central coastal margin occurs even later; AD 500 (1500
B.P.) and AD 1250/1300 (approximately 400 B.P.), respectively. Like their neighbors
in the Lower Mississippi Valley, UTCP groups continued using pottery right up
through contact with Europeans and Euro-Americans. Unlike many LMV groups, they
do not appear to have left archaeological signatures associated with intensive use of
cultigens, wild starchy seeds, or highly sedentary village settlements. UTCP mortuary
practices do suggest some ceremonial behavior, but it is not known if this is linked
with stratified social systems documented in some portions of the LMV. Pottery can
play critical roles in contexts of subsistence, mobility, and social complexity, but the
role(s) of pottery on the UTCP are not currently understood. Explanations for the
continued use of pottery on the UTCP implicate intense use of plant foods, including
starchy seeds and/or cultigens. Pottery may have become more attractive to UTCP
foragers as their territories became packed through time and group mobility declined
as a result of limited home ranges. Pottery may have also been a useful ceremonial or
symbolic object in yet undocumented social and political contexts. Determining the
functions and distribution of UTCP pottery will contribute to our understanding of
UTCP hunter-gatherer diet and mobility, as well as our understanding of pottery and
its context in hunter-gatherer adaptations.

CHAPTER 3: THEORETICAL ORIENTATION
Determining the kinds of economic and/or social behavior associated with
archaeological pottery in hunter-gatherer societies is a relatively new area of
scholarship (e.g., Arnold 1999; Eerkens 2002, 2003, 2004; Sassaman 1993; Simms,
Bright and Ugan 1997). In order to create useful models of hunter-gatherer pottery
production and use, I draw upon previous theoretical work in hunter-gatherer studies
as well as ceramic theory. Here I review theoretical work in both areas, and assess its
utility for modeling hunter-gatherer social and economic behavior. I then discuss how
human behavioral ecology addresses critical issues raised by other theoretical
approaches. I then present models of hunter-gatherer pottery use. The chapter closes
with a discussion of some of the possible socio-economic implications of pottery use.

Hunter gatherers and ceramic vessels: making sense of variability
The term âhunter-gathererâ encompasses a wide variety of social and
economic behavior (Kelly 1995). Hunter-gatherer behaviors vary considerably,
including those implicated with food procurement, food sharing, addressing risk, and
acquiring or maintaining social/political power. Current research and theory continues
to challenge and dispel outdated ideas of hunter-gatherer social and economic
homogeneity and simplicity (Kuhn and Stiner 2001; Kusimba 2005; Price and Brown
1985; Sassaman 1993). While rigid categorization of a âtypicalâ hunter-gatherer
adaptation is an impediment to understanding variability in human economic and
social behavior (Kelly 1995), researchers continue to point out that a distinguishing
feature of all hunter-gatherer adaptations is a reliance on wild foods (Kelly 1995;
Kuhn and Stiner 2001). The âwildnessâ of food resources also varies (Smith 2001) as
does the degree to which hunter-gatherer groups rely on them (Kelly 1995).
Nonetheless, a reliance on wild game and plants characterizes all hunter-gatherer
adaptations.

45
Traditional associations between pottery production and sedentary, foodproducing societies are based on the premise that the kinds of in which tasks these
groups typically engage allow them to take full advantage of ceramic vessels (e.g.,
Childe 1951). As sedentary societies, such groups are able to easily absorb some of the
costs of pottery production such as the time it takes to process clays, form vessels,
wait for vessels to dry before firing, and fire them (Arnold 1985). The idea of pottery
as a craft practiced exclusively by sedentary groups is based in part on a limited sense
of the properties of pottery: a tool for use over direct heat and prolonged storage. In
fact, the refractory properties of ceramic vessels do recommend them for use over
heat, especially for resources which require prolonged boiling such as domesticated
seeds and grains (Hoopes and Barnett 1995). Ideal designs for long-term storage
vessels include thick walls to increase vessel resistance to mechanical failure and
subsequent loss of contents. With these performance characteristics come tradeoffs:
vessels engineered for use over heat or long-term storage are too fragile or bulky to be
frequently moved and therefore unattractive to groups with high degrees of residential
mobility. Yet the potential properties of ceramic vessels are considerably more varied
than traditionally realized. For example, it is possible to use pottery for indirect
heating as well as direct heating tasks (Linton 1944; Sassaman 1993), and the
performance attributes of pots suited for indirect heating are different than those for
direct heating. Ethnographic study of hunter-gatherer pottery indicates that vessels can
be engineered to maximize their portability as well (Reid 1990). Ethnography and
archaeology have provided examples of hunter-gatherer production and use of ceramic
vessels (e.g., P. Arnold 1999; Eerkens et al. 2002; Gayton 1929; Hoopes 1995;
Hoopes and Barnett 1995; McGee 1971).

46
Previous approaches to modeling
Diffusion
One of the oldest and most commonly evoked explanations for hunter-gatherer
pottery use around the world is the idea that knowledge of the craft spread from
adjacent pottery-using cultures. Originally developed and used by archaeologists
working in other regions of the world (e.g., Meggers et al. 1965), the concept of
diffusion was invoked to explain the origins of early ceramic vessels in the American
Southeast, specifically in Florida and Georgia (Ford 1966; 1969; see Sassaman 1993
for a detailed discussion), and their later appearance in assemblages west of those
areas, including the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf coast (Jenkins et al. 1986;
Walthall 1980). In the case of the UTCP, vessel technology appears to have arrived
via the Lower Mississippi Valley (e.g., Aten 1983; Ricklis 2004). Although diffusion
is most likely an accurate description of how pottery spread throughout the American
Southeast, it is not an appropriate means to explain why pottery technology was
accepted (Sassaman 1993).

Cultural ecology and hunter-gatherer ceramic studies
The theoretical school of cultural ecology has influenced the modeling of
hunter-gatherer pottery use in two distinct ways. Most commonly recognized among
many American archaeologists is the application of cultural ecology to studies of
hunter-gatherer behavior. Also recognized by archaeologists who routinely work with
pottery is the influence of cultural ecology on modeling pottery use in general.
Cultural ecology has had a long and influential history in archaeology,
especially hunter-gatherer studies. The early theoretical work as originally developed
by Julian Steward was concerned with the effects of the natural environment on
human evolution (Kelly 1995). This early version of cultural ecology was predicated
on the idea that human behavior is closely tied to the natural environment. Steward
applied this idea to his study of hunter-gatherers in the Great Basin, arguing that there
were âcoreâ behaviors in human societies which were primarily motivated by

47
efficiency in food-getting behavior. Thus, knowledge of the environment could be
used to generate expectations about human behavior. While archaeologists often take
issue with the idea that the natural environment determines all aspects of human
behavior, they generally agree that much subsequent theoretical work owes much to
Stewardâs ideas. The New Archaeologists drew upon Stewardâs work in their efforts to
investigate hunter-gatherer behavior at the scale of the landscape (Bettinger 1991). A
prime example and an influential basis for much of the subsequent research on huntergatherer mobility and subsistence was Lewis Binfordâs work on seasonal differences
between sites sampled at a regional level (Binford 1964, 1980; Lovis et al. 2005).
Theoretical work on the interplay between resource use, settlement systems,
and technological change continues to be developed (e.g., Binford 2001). Although
rarely specifically discussed in the regional literature, Binfordâs work has greatly
influenced UTCP regional models of social and economic change and those of other
hunter-gatherer groups who use pottery. Binfordâs modeling of resource
intensification and technological change figures prominently in the previously
described Akokisa Model. For example, Binford proposes that territorial behavior
among hunter-gatherers increases with increasing population pressure. Territoriality
has the potential to limit mobility and thus the types of food resources to which a
given group has access (Binford 2001). Therefore, hunter-gatherers who prior to
territorial packing relied on large-bodied terrestrial resources, are predicted to respond
to the limited access to these resources by taking a higher frequency of small-bodied
prey. Fewer species may be taken, which in turn can decrease the temporal variance of
resources, causing groups to move less. Groups previously focused on terrestrial
resources are predicted to take aquatic resources if they have the opportunity to do so.
Hunter-gatherer groups who do not have access to aquatic resources are expected to
rely more on plants (Binford 2001).
These dietary changes are accompanied by increased investment in a variety of
more efficient procurement and processing technologies. Such technologies allow
hunter-gatherers to extract more energetic returns from an increasingly circumscribed

48
environment (Binford 2001). Technological change is especially easy to envision in
terms of aquatic resources, where nets and weirs can be used to take resources in bulk.
Pottery can be used as a tool to increase energetic returns of foods, particularly plant
foods. Small seeds are a prime example of a food which is more nutritional and
palatable when processed using heat. Pottery can be particularly well-suited to heating
tasks. There are implications of possible territorial constraints in terms of both
resource procurement and storage. Being able to acquire resources in bulk may create
opportunities to store excess food, and pots are implicated in storage tasks as well.
Finally, as the environment becomes more packed with people, particular locations
predictably rich in resources are dominated by a few individuals who exclude others
from access and thereby create socioeconomic inequality in their social units (Binford
2001).
Cultural ecology has influenced theoretical work in ceramic studies. The
concept of ceramic ecology was first formalized in Frederick Matsonâs âCeramics and
Manâ conference (Matson 1965; Feathers 1990). Matsonâs own contribution
emphasized environmental (e.g., raw clay, fuel) and cultural factors (e.g., water and
food processing needs, potter social status), positing that doing so explained spatial
and temporal variation in ceramic vessel technology. During this same time period,
Lewis Binford published âArchaeological Systematics and the Study of Culture
Processâ in which he advocated the study of archaeological phenomena such as
pottery in a systemic context (Binford 1965). Drawing upon ceramic ecology, Dean
Arnold continued looking for universal factors linking pottery use to culture in his
Ceramic Theory and Cultural Process (Arnold 1985). In his search to create
generalizations about pottery production and use in various cultures, Arnold employed
a systemic approach in which pottery production and use is reduced or amplified by a
variety of environmental and cultural factors.
Over the years, both cultural ecology and ceramic ecology have encountered
similar criticisms. Both larger applications of cultural ecology and those dealing

49
specifically with ceramic vessels rely heavily on ethnographic information. Indeed,
ethnographic information has proven useful in creating and testing hypotheses about
hunter-gatherer behavior. Critics have asserted that it can be problematic to assume
that specific ethnographic and archaeological cases resemble one another and make it
difficult to explain why the archaeological record is different from ethnographic cases
(Bettinger 1991; Feathers 1990). Cultural ecology and ceramic ecology have also been
subject to charges of environmental determinism and reductionism, with some arguing
that it is unlikely that a few environmental variables can be used to explain how
human social systems evolved (Trigger 1989). Others have argued that models based
in cultural and ceramic ecology may not be useful when seeking to explain changes in
hunter-gatherer subsistence, mobility, and pottery use over time because it emphasizes
commonalities between individual cultures or cases rather than variation in responses.
Some archaeologists have argued that cultural (and ceramic) ecology are unable to
adequately predict or explain the circumstances under which hunter-gatherers will use
pottery (Bettinger 1991; Rice 1996; Trigger 1984).
Granted, the circumstances affecting ceramic vessel production and use are far
more complex than a purely environmental approach would lead us to believe. Yet
cultural ecology has been influential in hunter-gatherer and ceramic theory precisely
because it does emphasize commonalities between individual cases, which are the
focus of much archaeological research. For example, in Ceramic Theory and Cultural
Process, Dean Arnold (1985) discusses a diverse set of factors which affect demand
for ceramic containers in cultures worldwide, from weather patterns to household
economics.

Economic approaches
In 1989, James Brown introduced an economic model of pottery production
and consumption which built on the concept of economic demand for pottery. Brown
originally developed the model to explain the initial adoption of ceramic vessel
technology. In providing the context for the model he questioned the assumption that

50
pottery was adopted because it was necessarily functionally superior to other
container types, an idea which has greatly influenced subsequent ceramic studies
emphasizing not only economic but social approaches (e.g., Hoopes and Barnett;
Vitelli 1995, 1999). Brown argued that an increase in demand for containers was the
catalyst for the initial use of pots. Thus, the pace of pottery production is affected by
an overall demand for containers. It is the particular efficiency of the pottery
production process that recommends its adoption. For example, ceramic vessels can be
fired in batches, one of the attributes which allows potters to easily scale up
production when demand for containers increases. The nature of pottery manufacture
allows pots to be made in stages, which means there can be pauses in manufacture to
complete other necessary tasks (this was also noted by Arnold). Given these features
of pottery production, the appearance of ceramic vessels was not necessarily a solution
to changes in dietary and food processing techniques, but rather a means of helping
groups solve their time allocation problems. The idea of pottery as tool to facilitate the
allocation of labor has gained a foothold in ceramic studies (e.g., Crown and Wills
1995; Eerkens 2004; Sassaman 1993). In addition, Brownâs model influenced the
orientation of ceramic theory toward models which take social and behavioral
conditions into account. Dissatisfaction with the inadequacy of models which gave
primacy to the natural environment to explain hunter-gatherer and pottery production
impacted archaeological theory in general and ceramic studies in particular.
The model has the power to explain why we might see changes in vessel
frequency in the archaeological record: demand for containers increases to an extent
that people are willing to incur the costs of pottery production (or increased pottery
production). Yet the model has sometimes been used in a circular manner. Most
applications of the model hypothesize an increase in demand for containers at a point
in the local archaeological record when they appear or become more frequent in the
archaeological record. The researcher then supplies a reason for the increase in
demand; rather than deriving it from the model itself. An example of this use of
Brownâs economic model is the claim that the appearance of ceramic vessels at

51
Poverty Point was the result of increased demands for containers. Such containers
were necessary for cooking practices needed to feed the army of workers involved in
the construction of earthworks, as well as the public functions associated with
earthworks (Gibson and Melancon 2004). Such an explanation is entirely possible, but
in this case the explanation is applied rather than tested. Here, as in many cases where
the model is used, the appearance or increase in pottery is the result of increased
demand for containers.

Social roles of pottery
While it does not directly identify the factors influencing the demand for
ceramic containers, Brownâs model has provided a means for other researchers to
envision the nature of pottery adoption and use within a variety of contexts.
Archaeologists have begun to develop theories to understand the uses of pottery and
its role in larger socioeconomic contexts. Initial work in this area was begun by
Sassaman in his research on the slow spread of pottery technology in the southeastern
Atlantic coastal plain (Sassaman 1993). Using data which indicated early pottery in
this area was used for heating tasks Sassaman inferred that pottery was a tool for
reducing food processing time or expanding the amount of food processed. He argued
that increasing construction, ceremonial, and provisioning obligations during the Shell
Mound Archaic Period created shifts in the time budgets of hunter-gatherer groups.
While the time budget problem had an economic component Sassaman emphasized
that it existed due to social factors or the âsocial demands of laborâ (Sassaman 1993,
1995). The slow diffusion of pottery technology across the southeastern coastal plain
and Piedmont was inhibited by socioeconomic factors as well. In the context of
regional soapstone networks which were a means of acquiring and maintaining power
and status among men, as well as maintaining social ties, pottery was initially a weak
interloper favored by women experiencing increased demands on their labor. Thus,
according to Sassaman, pottery was initially used by those outside male social
networks and prestige competitionâwomen and those in dispersed settlements living

52
far from hubs of regional soapstone trading networks. In this model, the role of
pottery in a given society is not strictly economic. Pottery becomes a tool that changes
settlement and subsistence patterns, and access to resources and power (Sassaman
1993).
Other models of the role of pottery in societies have focus on potential
socioeconomic roles of pottery, but in a manner emphasizing the potential uses of
pottery in social actions. In his work on prestige technologies, Brian Hayden
distinguishes between material culture designed for everyday, practical applications
and that used in social contexts. Items created for social tasks can be further divided
into two types: 1) objects designed for non-competitive alliances and ritual purposes;
2) objects used to in surplus-based competitions for prestige (Hayden 1998). Items
intended for prestige tasks allow their owners to display âwealth, power, or control
over resourcesâ (Hayden 1995). Hayden hypothesizes that many technological
processes were responses to the demands of prestige-based competition (e.g., pottery,
metallurgy, ground stone cutting tool manufacture, domestication). Only later did they
assume practical, utilitarian functions in everyday life. In some cases prestige
competition is a catalyst for technological advances in utilitarian function (Hayden
1995). In this model pottery is prized for its aesthetic appeal and the fact that a great
deal of labor can be invested in its manufacture. In order for prestige goods to enter
and gain use in a given society, two conditions must exist: 1) the area must be rich in
natural (food) resources; 2) aggrandizers must be present. Thus, the initial use of
technologies such as pottery depends upon an abundance of resources (Hayden 1990).
Hayden argues that aggrandizing individuals are present in any given populationâa
point that remains speculatively philosophical and therefore must be taken on faith.
This assumption of the theory lowers its predictive value.
Others argue that pottery may have originated as part of a ritual process in
which the act of making pottery had ritual value (Vitelli 1995; 1999). In this scenario,
a useable container is not the goal. Instead, the process of making the pot is integral to
the ritual, and is initiated and presided over by women. In Vitelliâs case study of

53
ceramic vessels from Franchthi Cave in Greece, she argues that Early Neolithic
wares were the result of this ritual practice and that their low frequency and poor
construction support her assertion. Middle Neolithic pottery assemblages from
Franchthi Cave exhibit a higher frequency of vessels. Middle Neolithic assemblages
have a great variety of shapes that are difficult to produce and fire. Overall vessel size
is small, leading Vitelli to conclude that the production and use of Middle Neolithic
pots at Franchthi was primarily for social display. Not until the late Neolithic do pots
appear to be used in routine food preparation, when they are larger and less effort is
used to manufacture them. The portion of Vitelliâs research devoted to explaining the
presence of Early Neolithic pottery is difficult to evaluate in terms of other
assemblages. How does one know if a given assemblage was in fact created by
shaman-potters? The portion of the scenario addressing the Middle Neolithic wares is
similar in some respects to Haydenâs conception of pottery being used as a social tool
rather than to address immediate needs presented by the natural environment. Models
such as these are difficult to operate and evaluate, because many possible attributes of
ceramic vessels can be useful in social tasks.
Human behavioral ecology and modeling hunter-gatherer pottery use
The previous discussions of theoretical approaches highlight three critical
aspects of modeling hunter-gatherer pottery and use. First, while it is important to
study individual cases, many archaeologists are ultimately concerned with the general
circumstances of pottery adoption and use. Second, models must take into account the
costs, benefits, and tradeoffs of pottery production and use, rather than simply
assuming pottery is desirable in all cases. Third, models should address the effects of
the natural environment and social contexts of pottery production and use. I argue here
that human behavioral ecology is a useful theoretical platform for modeling huntergatherer ceramic use because it takes the above issues into account. It has also been
useful in creating models which are simple and testable (Winterhalder and Smith
1992). For these reasons I use human behavioral ecology as a tool to generate

54
hypotheses concerning hunter-gatherer pottery production and use on the UTCP in
the subsequent section.

Definition and features of human behavioral ecology
Human behavioral ecology examines human behavior in an ecological context
using principles of evolutionary theory and optimization. This theoretical approach
focuses on determining how ecological and social factors influence and shape
behavioral flexibility within and between human populations (Winterhalder and Smith
1992). Originally developed in the biological sciences (where it is referred to as
behavioral ecology), human behavioral ecology has been used for decades by
anthropologists to develop models to understand human behavioral and cultural
diversity in past and present societies (Smith 1983; Winterhalder and Smith 1992).
Models generated from human behavioral ecology premises have been used to
understand the diversity of hunter-gatherer resource procurement, group mobility, and
other aspects of behavior.
There are three key assumptions of human behavioral ecology theory which
allow it to be useful for explaining variability in behavior, modeling economic
decisions, and accounting for socially-oriented behavior as well as behavior directly
linked with the physical environment. These assumptions include natural selection,
methodological individualism, and optimization constraints. Since behavioral ecology
is concerned with the evolutionary basis of human behavior, it draws heavily on the
concept of natural selection (Winterhalder and Smith 1992). Briefly the theory of
natural selection posits that on average over time, more individuals are born than can
successfully reproduce and this is so due to environmental constraints (Winterhalder
and Smith 1992). Individuals who can engage in reproductively optimal behaviors
when responding to their environment will be more reproductively successful (i.e.
leave greater numbers of offspring) than those who do not or cannot. Methodological
individualism is simply the idea that the actions and intentions of individuals
constitute the properties of larger groups, such as societies. Thus, the properties of

55
groups are derived from the choices of their individual members (Smith and
Winterhalder 1992:39). Two additional corollaries of methodological individualism as
conceived in human behavioral ecology are that individuals act rationally and out of
self-interest. The final assumption is that human behavior seeks to be optimal with
regard to reproductive fitness, although it cannot always be so because humans must
often compromise between particular goals and available options. Thus, the premise of
optimal behavior is often referred to as âconstrained optimalityâ (Winterhalder and
Kennett 2006:11).
Natural selection is a key aspect of behavioral ecology, which enables the
theory to acknowledge and explain variability in human behavior using the concept of
natural selection operating on given variability. Thus, human behavior assumes a
plasticity which can be accounted for by theory (Winterhalder and Smith 1992). Built
into human behavioral ecology is the acknowledgement that environment is complex
because it includes physical, biological, and social aspects. Therefore the terms
âenvironmentâ is broadly characterized in human behavioral ecology (Winterhalder
and Smith 1992). This inclusive definition of environment allows human behavioral
ecological theory to be used to investigate the diversity of human behavior. The
emphasis of human behavioral ecology on modeling ultimate rather than proximate
causes for human behavior enables the researcher to investigate the reasons for a
spectrum of behavior, rather than focusing on particular explanations for individual
cases (Winterhalder and Smith 1992).
Human behavioral ecology is not only a means of addressing ultimate causes
of variability in behavior, but it offers a useful array of tools for modeling behavior
from an economic perspective. The assumption of optimization applies to the
economic aspects of human behavioral ecology models. In addition, basic concepts
derived from microeconomic theory are used to model human behavior in a variety of
contexts, including non-market economies such as those of hunter-gatherers
(Winterhalder and Kennett 2006). These basic concepts include the marginal value
theorem, opportunity costs, discounting, and risk-sensitive behavior. The marginal

56
value theorem holds that the consumption of a good or participation in a given
activity has not only an initial but also a marginal value that changes with quantity
(e.g., amount consumed or time spent). The marginal value of goods and activities is
what an individual uses to determine when to stop consuming or to do something else.
The decision to change behaviors is also mediated by opportunity costs, or the return
an individual can gain from engaging in another activity.
Another economic conceptâdiscountingâis not used in this current study of
pottery production. Discounting refers to the behavior of discounting the rewards of an
activity which requires individuals to initially incur costs and wait for a delayed
return. A shift from foraging to food producing involves the concept of discounting, as
food producers must pay the costs of planting and tending food resources up front and
must wait for a harvest with uncertain returns. The concept of discounting has not
been widely utilized, but its potential application to models of the transition to
agriculture has implications for some pottery studies (Winterhalder and Kennett 2006).
Risk-sensitive behavior is also an economic concept useful in human behavioral
ecology models, including those concerned with technological change (Fitzhugh
2001). While not directly addressed in the particular hypotheses presented here, it is an
application which has implications for the adoption of ceramic vessel technology.

General criticisms of human behavioral ecology models
Critics have argued that the focus on optimal behavior does not capture the
complexity of human decision-making. Also according the environment such a large
role in explanation strikes some as smacking of environmental determinism. These
criticisms can be addressed by briefly highlighting some main assumptions of the
theory. Behavioral ecology draws upon the concepts of methodological individualism,
rational action, and optimization in order to create useable models. Methodological
individualism posits that the actions of individuals comprise the properties of groups.
Thus, it is individuals who make decisions, and they can respond to cultural ideas of
success in addition to biological directives (Smith and Winterhalder 1992; Kelly

57
1995). Behavioral ecology also assumes that people are rational actors whose
decision-making is guided by self-interest (Smith and Winterhalder 1992). A key
assumption of the concept of optimization is that reproductive fitness can be measured
using the proxy of foraging efficiency, where an individual either maximizes food
gathered or minimizes time spent foraging. There are other possible reasons to forage
efficiently rather than just to eat. For example, time for non-foraging activity may be
scarce. It is also important to realize that foragers can use excess food to gain access to
mates, engage in reciprocity, or other actions which ultimately enhance their
reproductive fitness (Kelly 1995). And while all behavior is not reproductively
optimal, behaviors in a given population will tend toward optimal (Kelly 1995). What
makes behavioral ecology most useful to modeling ceramic vessel use in
socioeconomic contexts is its capacity to generate testable models with explicit
assumptions.

Recasting traditional and recent models of ceramic vessel function
Traditional models of ceramic production and use rely on one or both of the
following two primary conceptions of their function: as tools to reduce the high
processing costs of food, or as tools to reduce risk by storing food. More recent
models suggest that ceramic vessels are used primarily to confer social/political
prestige on those individuals who have access to them or to their contents. Traditional
conceptions of hunter-gatherers subsistence, mobility, and ethos emphasize hunting,
high residential mobility, lack of long-term storage, and an emphasis on egalitarian
behavior (e.g., Lee and DeVore 1968). Subsequent research indicates that these
behaviors are points along a continuum of variability in hunter-gatherer lifeways
(Kelly 1995). Therefore, hunter-gatherer societies vary in their overall consumption of
plant foods with high procurement/processing costs, mobility, degree of storage, and
aggrandizing behavior.
The empirical predictions of the hypotheses described below rest on multiple
lines of evidence. In Table 3.1, hypotheses are described in a matrix form, listing

58
presence/absence or nature of vessel attributes expected for each hypothesis: wall
thickness, vessel morphology, porosity, and source of aplastics, amount of decorative
treatment, heating use, and food residue. These attributes are of two kinds: those
relating to the intended performance of the vessel, and those that are the result of how
the vessel was actually used. Performance attributes affect how pottery can be used,
but there is always the possibility that performance attributes are incidental and do not
relate to pottery function. This problem is addressed by creating empirical
expectations which include both performance and use attributes. If functional
attributes are in fact related to performance, then there should be a correlation of use
wear and performance attributes. Some of the empirical expectations hold true for
more than one hypothesis, raising the possibility that one hypothesis cannot be
differentiated from another. This potential problem of equifinality is avoided, as at
least one empirical expectation differs between the hypotheses. The empirical
expectations for each set of hypotheses concerning food processing, storage, and
prestige tasks are described in greater detail below. Discussions of the hypotheses and
their implications precede the discussion of empirical expectations.

Food production
Anthropologists and archaeologists have long linked the manufacture and use
of ceramic vessels with agriculture (Hoopes and Barnett 1995). Archaeologists have
commonly associated the adoption of ceramic vessels with the Neolithic period (e.g.,
Childe 1951; Rice 1987). Food production is more broadly defined as the intensive
uses of wild plant species through varying levels of domesticate cultivation (Smith
2001). There is a strong intellectual link between intensive plant use and pottery
(Hoopes and Barnett 1995); and in the Americas, empirical links between intensive
wild plant use and pottery have been demonstrated (Braun 1983; Eerkens 2004).
Ceramic vessels can minimize processing costs of r-selected resources, particularly
plant foods such as starchy seeds (Bright et al. 2002; Eerkens 2004; Gremillion 2004).
In ecological terms, âr-selected resourcesâ are types of animals and plants which

59
develop rapidly and reproduce early (often only once), have relatively small body
size, are short-lived, and are prone to catastrophic mortality (Hayden 1981; Rafferty
1985). These resources typically have small home ranges and concentrated
productivity. A corollary to the plant processing function is the idea that ceramic
vessels can be used to reduce food processing costs, particularly when the maximum
amount of nutritional/caloric value must be extracted from existing resources (Braun
1983; Reid 1990). Many of these species are so-called âr-selected resourcesâ and
include plants, shellfish, and small mammals. Thus, pottery use is often associated
with heavy use of resources which have high procurement and/or processing costs,
including starchy seeds.
Pottery can be used to process a variety of foods in many different ways.
Ceramic vessels can be used for baking, steaming, boiling, mixing, grinding,
pounding, and/or soaking foods to prepare them for consumption or further processing
(Hally 1983). While there are definite empirical links between pottery use and rselected resources, there are also cases where pots have been used to process largebodied resources with considerably lower processing costs, such as large terrestrial
mammals (e.g., Reid 1984). In some instances, ceramic containers can be used to
render toxic foods edible and coarse grains digestible by allowing prolonged
unattended boiling over fire which helps break down silica cell walls in plant foods
and increase digestibility. Pots can also be used to help break down the connective
tissue in meat and thus increase its palatability.
In order to understand how much UTCP inhabitants were focused on starchy
seeds or large mammals, it is most useful to focus on the heating properties of ceramic
vessels. Pottery can be used in a variety of direct and indirect heating methods:
cooking without liquid (including âdryâ boiling, roasting, and parching), simmering,
and boiling in liquid (Reid 1990). Each of these cooking techniques is suited to
particular types of foods. So-called âdryâ cooking heats foods to about 150 degrees C
and does not necessarily require ceramic vessels. Simmering occurs between 88 and
85 degrees C and is very effective in breaking down the connective tissue in meat.

60
Ethnohistoric information indicates that simmering can be best accomplished by
indirect heating methods in which rocks or fired clay balls are heated placed in vessels
to cook the contentsâthis is sometimes referred to as âstone boilingâ (Reid 1990).
Ethnoarchaeological work indicates that simmering can also be accompanied without
clay balls and can be used to process starchy plant foods such as rice (Skibo 1992).
Placing vessels directly over flames or coals is more useful when attempting to bring
the contents to a boil (about 100 degrees C). Direct heating is particularly suited to
gelatinizing the grains of starchy seeds, a process which occurs at about 93 degrees C
(Reid 1990).

Hypothesis 1a: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as tools to process starchy
seeds and/or domesticates.
If groups are consistently using their pottery for processing domesticates or
starchy wild plants, then vessel assemblages overall would have high frequencies of
pots with construction attributes geared toward performance over direct heat (Table
3.1). If vessels were created for use over direct heat, then they would be expected to
have thin walls with a uniform thickness for effectively conducting heat, and round
bases and smoothly curving walls to make them more resistant to thermal shock.
Vessel porosity should be low to prevent loss of liquid contents through the walls and
help vessel contents to a boil. Mineral non-plastics such as sand or grog should be
present in vessel pastes to increase resistance to crack propagation from thermal stress.
Decoration is expected to be minimal, as pots used for food processing are utilitarian
items. Instead, any marks on the pots would be in the form of soot indicating use over
direct heat. Any organic residues present in the vessels should reflect cultigens or wild
starchy plants. It is possible that the functional attributes of uniformly thin walls,
rounded bases, low porosity, and local minerals in vessel pastes will not be present in
the assemblages. Yet the use-wear attributes of sooting and plant food residues are
necessary conditions to infer plant processing over heat.

61
Hypothesis 1b: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as tools to process meat
from large-bodied resources.
In contrast, if vessels were used in contexts of large animal hunting and high
residential mobility, then they should display attributes enhancing their portability,
such as thick walls to withstand resistance to mechanical shock. Fiber temper could be
used to create a porous, lightweight vessel body resistant to crack propagation. If there
are mineral inclusions, then at least some should be from non-local sources, as groups
pursuing large animals would be expected to have extensive home ranges. Groups
focusing on large-bodied resources have utilized indirect heating techniques and
therefore built vessels that had insulating properties and resistance to mechanical
shock from boiling stones or clay balls, such as thick walls and thick, flat bases. Flat
bases would also be more likely to be present on vessels not used over direct heat, as
there would be no need to avoid angular forms more susceptible to thermal shock. Pots
would not be expected to be highly decorated, as they are utilitarian wares. There
would be no evidence of use over direct heat, and again pots would not be highly
decorated. Food residues in indirect heating vessels should reflect high degrees of
large animal processing. In order to infer a relationship between large animal
consumption and residential mobility, the necessary attributes are paste from non-local
sources, and large animal residues.

Storage strategies
Ceramic vessels are also traditionally modeled as tools used to improve storage
efficiency and minimize the risk of losing valuable food (Rice 1987). Storage of food
is an ideal function of ceramic vessels, as the physical properties of pottery can be
manipulated to enable it to protect foodstuffs from vermin and moisture (Rice 1987).
Long-term storage behavior is usually associated with food production and high
degrees of sedentism, although there is a high probability that storage was used by
groups who had varying degrees of food production and sedentism (e.g., Damp and
Vargas 1995). Indeed, almost all hunter-gatherer societies, past and present, store food
during at least part of the annual cycle (Binford 1980). Anthropologists have

62
recognized different storage strategies from ethnographic research and theoretical
work. The types of storage groups employ depend on the temporal and spatial
distribution of food resources, the cost of defending stores, and the nature of possible
benefits of sharing the stores (including trade and reduction of risk) and the size of
resource packages.
Food storage allows people to average food surpluses in order to buffer against
temporally predictable shortages, typically during the annual cycle (Goland 1991;
Wiessner 1982). Yet a food storage strategy is only useful to groups who can
consistently generate a sufficient surplus to cover their shortages (Cashdan 1992;
Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978; Goland 1991). Groups who experience predictable
spatial food shortages may solve the problem by moving frequently and maintaining
social networks to facilitate this movement (Wiessner 1982). Research among modern
hunter-gatherer societies indicates that groups who experience little or no food
shortages have little incentive to store (Goland 1991; Testart 1982). In these cases,
groups would be expected to pursue other strategies.
Storage as a strategy can create the benefit of alleviating resource shortages,
but there are also potential costs involved. Stores may have to be defended from others
who have not contributed to their procurement or processing, but can benefit from
consuming or trading them. Defending stores commonly entails costs: individuals or
groups may have to remain in one location in order to defend stores (Dyson-Hudson
and Smith 1978). Remaining in a single area can be problematic to groups whose
subsistence practices require them to be mobile. Behavioral ecological models predict
that groups will defend stores only when the costs of defense are lower than eating or
trading additional calories. It is possible that some storage strategies would have
appealed to residentially mobile hunter-gatherer groups (Bettinger 1999a, 1999b).
Storing resources with minimal preliminary processing costs may have been an
attractive strategy for mobile groups facing unpredictable shortages. In the warm,
humid climate of the UTCP, such resources were most likely nuts and seeds. Most of
the processing costs of preparing such âback-loadedâ resources for storage are

63
incurred when they are consumed, not when they are stored. In contrast, âfrontloadedâ resources have high processing costs to prepare them for storage. On the
UTCP, front-loaded resources consisted of roots, meat, and fish Storage can entail
other costs as well: there can be physical risks entailed in defense and potential social
costs of refusing to share with others. The risks of refusing to share are discussed in
greater detail below.
Other strategies can provide benefits similar to those of storage. Groups or
individuals may use forms of sharing such as trade or reciprocity to address potential
resource shortages. Exchange (trade) with adjacent groups can enable hunter-gatherers
to average spatial and temporal fluctuations in resources, especially when the groups
are located in different ecozones, or have different resource procurement systems
which complement one another, such as hunter-gatherers and horticulturists
(Spielmann 1986). Trade may also allow groups to âstoreâ social obligations to use
during lean times in the future (see Wiessner 1982 for an example of !Kung hxaro
practices). Sharing (reciprocity) can be used to reduce the risk of loss of resources, but
it is a strategy which makes sense only under certain conditions (Cashdan 1985). In
order for reciprocity to be a viable strategy there must be lots of individuals or groups
who could potentially sustain accidental loss but few which sustain loss at any given
time. That is, reciprocity works for those experiencing local scarcity but regional
abundance. Groups with higher frequencies of sedentism are expected to find storage
to be a more attractive strategy rather than incurring the costs of moving people to
goods (Cashdan 1985).
Individuals or groups may also elect to share their resources with others who
do not aid in their procurement. Good providers may tolerate theft to avoid costs
incurred from conflict (what Winterhalder terms a âcost of strifeâ; Winterhalder
1997:125), and theoretically they can still expect larger shares of a resource âpacketâ
they acquire rather than sharing portions of a poor hunterâs packet. Sharing can also
entail other benefits ultimately related to reproductive fitness such as political
alliances and access to mates (Bliege Bird and Bird 1997). But there are good reasons

64
not to shareâat least not too much. Individuals who scrounge resources from others
may lower the overall average food acquisition rate and hurt the group. And while
there may be little or no cost to sharing a large resource or âlumpyâ packet, sharing
smaller packets of resources makes less sense from the perspective of a successful
forager (Winterhalder 1997). Thus, resources which come in small packages are less
likely to be shared. Storage may in fact be a useful strategy when such resources are
predictably synchronized as well (Hawkes 1992; Winterhalder 1997). Given this
reasoning, it makes sense that pottery use among hunter-gatherers may not be
associated with sharing behavior, but rather the private procurement, storage, and
processing of small-package resources which do not require cooperation to acquire
(Eerkens 2004).

Storage hypotheses
As previously discussed, storage behavior has been observed in huntergatherer societies. Storage is linked with fairly sedentary societies where smallpackage resources are common in the diet and sharing is minimal. Such a âfrontloadedâ storage strategy is used for foods which require a lot of initial time and labor
investment to prepare for storage. A âback-loadedâ storage strategy may be useful in
cases where groups are fairly mobile and are therefore interested in limiting the costs
of preparing and possibly losing stored foods to people or animals that could raid
caches. Thus, if and how ceramic vessels are used for storage has implications for the
mobility of hunter-gatherer groups.

Hypothesis 2a: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used for âfront-loadedâ storage.
Generally, vessels designed for storage have thick walls to increase vessel
resistance to mechanical shock Thick-walled vessels are common in domestic contexts
where household occupants could accidentally bump into vessels (Table 3.1). Making
a storage vessel would not require the added cost of taking time to create walls of
uniform thickness, as storage vessels would not be subject to thermal stress that a wall

65
with uniform thickness can minimize (Rice 1987). Orifices of storage vessels
should be narrow to restrict access to contents so that stores would be less affected by
vermin or loss of contents when vessels are accidentally bumped (Skibo 1992).
Porosity of storage vessels should be low to limit loss of liquid contents, and mineral
sources of temper would most likely be local for such utilitarian pots in fairly
sedentary groups. Decorative treatment would most likely be low and it is unlikely
that vessels would be used over heat. It is also possible that vessels used for âfrontloadedâ storage
All of these attributes can apply to vessels both front and back-loaded storage
strategies. The use attribute which can be used to differentiate between these strategies
is the presence or absence of food residues and possibly mineral inclusions from local
geologic sources. Most âfront-loadedâ stores have high fat or oil, or other contents
with semi-liquid to liquid properties. Therefore, pots used in a front-loaded strategy
would be expected to have high frequencies of organic residue from liquids or fats. It
is possible that it would be difficult to differentiate between pots used for front-loaded
storage and those used for processing resources using indirect heating methods, as the
front-loaded storage hypothesis relies on low porosity and variable wall thickness,
both of which are useful but not absolutely necessary attributes for a storage vessel.

Hypothesis 2b: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used for âback-loadedâ storage.
In a back-loaded strategy, foods are processed minimally if at all prior to
storage. Storage of dry items figures predominantly in âback-loadedâ storage
strategies, an excellent example of a back-loaded food is nuts, which can be stored in
the shell. If pots were used primarily for âback-loadedâ storage, then pots would have
little organic residue signatures, as foods would leave little if any organic residue in
the vessel walls. If âback-loadedâ storage strategies are most useful to highly mobile
foragers as Bettingerâs model predicts, then it is probable that vessels would have
mineral inclusions from non-local geologic sources. Pots which were highly porous
and/or have fiber inclusions would be ideal for highly mobile groups. It is important to

66
note that pots intended for âback-loadedâ storage would have the same performance
attributes as pots intended for âfront-loadedâ storage. Thus, use wear dataâin the
form of organic residueâand must be obtained in order to assess front and back
loaded storage hypotheses. Sourcing studies would also be helpful in evaluating this
hypothesis. Back-loaded storage can be differentiated from other functions by the lack
of an organic residue signature.
One possible exception to the âfront-loadedâ= âwetâ/ âback-loadedâ= âdryâ
reasoning is the storage of water which is useful to all groups with varying degrees of
mobility. Water storage vessels would have most of the performance attributes
discussed above, except for a food residue signature. Therefore, water storage vessels
may resemble those used for dry storage and there is no certain way to distinguish
between the two. Vessels used for water storage may also be porous and therefore not
match the porosity expectations for storage vessels. Thus, water storage is a potential
confounding factor when trying to determine storage strategy and related mobility
patterns using ceramic vessels.

Prestige and costly signaling
In the past few decades, archaeologists have conceptually linked ceramic
vessel production with prestige behavior in two ways: pottery as one of a suite of
crafts practiced by specialized producers in societies with some degree of
social/economic complexity, and as a ware which can be used by individuals or groups
to gain and maintain social status or accrue other social benefits in societies which
may have a very low degree of complexity. Relationships between the production of
ceramic vessels and social/economic prestige are common in the study the
development of societies with a complex organization of labor, in which elite patrons
support the production and redistribution of vessels over a large territory. While the
research presented here focuses on foraging societies rather than state or empire-based
societies, I use concepts from craft specialization research to develop empirical
expectations for wares produced by foraging societies.

67
Recent research has focused on the idea that ceramic vessels were used as
tools to accrue social and political prestige in foraging societies (e.g., Hayden 1995;
Rice 1996). Although prestige models are not traditionally consistent with the social
structure documented for socially egalitarian, residentially mobile hunter-gatherers,
ethnographic research suggests that there are forms of prestige behavior among groups
traditionally described as socially egalitarian (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Lee 1972).
While socially egalitarian hunter-gatherers typically emphasize individual autonomy
and movement, and accruing material possessions is often at odds with these values,
there are examples of craft traditions in foraging societies traditionally described as
socially egalitarianâsuch as the !Kung (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Wiessner 1982).
It is not known if ceramic vessels are made and used as prestige items/tools by huntergatherer societies with high degrees of egalitarianism, or if the use of pottery in
prestige contexts is restricted to societies exhibiting greater degrees of social
inequality. Generally, ceramic vessels have the potential to be ideal prestige items, as
they can be made to be aesthetically pleasing and rare or exotic materials can be used
in their construction (Hayden 1995). The manufacture of ceramic prestige wares
typically involves greater labor investment in the form of decorative embellishments
such as surface design, color, and luster (Costin and Hagstrum 1995; Hayden 1998).
This high degree of labor investment is often attributed to the primary functions of
prestige wares: to appear desirable through their beauty, rarity, and/or the high cost of
their production (Hayden 1998), and to communicate social and political information
to those who make and use them (Costin and Hagstrum 1995). Recent ethnographic
research suggests that in some cases, pottery production can be converted into other
kinds of fitness-enhancing benefits (such as obtaining well-to-do husbands; Bliege
Bird and Smith 2005). However, pottery can also be produced using a minimum of
labor investment in societies with varying degrees of complexity. These types of wares
are available to most if not all members of a society, and are usually intended for
utilitarian tasks. In such cases vessel manufacture reflects the desire to minimize

68
production costs (Costin 1991; Costin and Hagstrum 1995), and construction
indicates a primary role as everyday tools (Braun 1983).
Ceramic vessels are potentially implicated with prestige behavior in another
manner. The actual value of ceramic vessels can also derive from the items within that
may be of social or economic significance, such as exotic foods and/or intoxicants
(Arthur 2002; Hoopes and Barnett 1995). Ethnohistoric information and
anthropological theory indicate that the processing, display, and consumption of such
foods are of social and political value (Hayden 1995). The creation, display, and
sharing of exotic foods can be used in a competitive manner to signal political
strength, gain power, or create/strengthen political alliances (Bliege Bird and Smith
2005; Hayden 1990). Logically, the containers for these foods would be subject to
public display. Therefore, pottery used in prestige tasks may be highly crafted in order
to enhance its aesthetic appeal and showcase the high amount of labor needed to make
it (Hayden 1995).
It is possible that the presence of pottery alone could reflect prestige-oriented
behavior. In some contexts pottery might have been so novel that its rarity may have
had a symbolic significance (e.g., Vitelliâs work in Greece). Proponents of this idea
argue that pots used in non-utilitarian contexts such as ritual feasts need not
necessarily display fine craftsmanship or high labor investment. Small vessel size and
overall low vessel frequency would indicate that pots were rare items with possible
ritual significance or prestige value. While it is possible that relatively
undistinguished-looking pottery may have functioned in this manner, it is also possible
that there are other reasons as to why vessels would be small and appear infrequently
in the archaeological record.
Recent work in costly signaling theory has the potential to reconcile symbolic
interpretations of ceramic use and theories grounded in economic adaptation (Bliege
Bird and Smith 2005). The term âcostly signalingâ is used to refer to behaviors which
otherwise appear to negatively affect individual fitness, were it not for their social
context. In pottery production, time spent making (or learning how to make) elaborate

69
or finely crafted wares is time which could be spent in other pursuits. Costly
signaling is expected in circumstances where there is variation in a population of a
given attribute which can be signaled, observers can gain from accurate information
about variation in quality. Those who give costly signals stand to benefit if the
receiver attends to the message. Bliege Bird and Smith argue that costly signaling can
be honest communication if it cannot be faked. Recipients of signals can test the
accuracy of the signal, so liars can be found out. Costly signaling has the potential to
explain behavior which appears to be wasteful or altruistic, by arguing that it actually
is not. Costly signaling theory emphasizes that the benefits to the signaler are
âsymbolic capitalâ which can be converted into other types of currency.
Forms of costly signaling which have the potential to directly or indirectly
involve the production and use of ceramic vessels include sharing food or other
resources on an unconditional basis, competitive feasting and other âwastefulâ
subsistence behavior, and labor-intensive craft traditions. An example of costly
signaling is presented by Bliege Bird and Smith (2005): among the Achuar-Quichua of
Ecuador, it appears that women who are skilled pottery makers may actually be able to
better secure marriages to politically-well connected men. Married women can signal
their abilities and political connections through performing their craft skillfully.
Pottery production may also be logically linked with competitive feasting. The
production and serving of feast foods may require aesthetically pleasing vessels
exhibiting high labor investment which assist in creating the signal. Here, the signal is
comprised of the labor available for creating the pottery as well as the labor to prepare
for and host such large gatherings. Using the logic of the nascent theory of costly
signaling, pottery used for prestige tasks such as serving would be expected to have
visible indicators of high labor investment, and skill (which takes time to acquire).
Hypothesis 3: Ceramic vessels on the UTCP were used as objects for gaining and/or
maintaining social, economic, or political prestige.
Despite the name, costly signaling modeling does not require that a signal
actually have a high cost. Some signals are simply not possible to fake (see Bliege

70
Bird and Smith 2005 for examples). Signaling by making and/or using ceramic
vessels most likely entails committing time (logically in the form of labor) which
could have been spent on other tasks. There are two types of costs involved in pottery
manufacture: procuring raw materials and labor investment in creating the finished
product. At first glance, the pottery of the UTCP does not appear to be costly to
produce. Clays in this area are plentiful and in a sense pre-mixed with non-plastics and
ready to use for vessel manufacture (Ellis 1992). As ubiquitous as they are, these clays
can hardly be described as rare and difficult to procure. Most researchers have
reasonably assumed that these vessels are made from local materials widely available
throughout the area, but the geologic provenance of these wares has not been
investigated. Pottery may be costly in terms of labor investment as well. It is possible
that UTCP pottery was costly to manufacture and therefore made a useful prestige
good. It takes time and skill to create attributes such as uniformly thin walls and
extensive decorative treatment. Previous observations of UTCP pottery assemblages
indicate that many wares are predominantly plain with little decorative surface
treatment (e.g., cordmarking, stamping, incising, punctuation, red wash). Whether
UTCP vessels contained rare or costly foods useful in prestige display contexts is
unknown. Pots could have contained cultigens, possibly traded from the Caddo. The
domestic contexts and plain appearance of the ceramic vessels themselves make them
unlikely prestige goods. While some vessels have been recovered from burial contexts,
the great majority of sherds have been found in activity and midden areas.
If the intended use of UTCP vessels was for prestige tasks then vessel bodies
would be expected to exhibit high degrees of labor investment: thin walls, and high
amounts of decorative treatment (Table 3.1). Vessels may be composed of raw
materials which are rare or difficult to procure, such as clays from other regions. If this
is the case, vessel assemblages would have high amounts of sherds with non-local
mineral inclusions in their pastes, as it is costly to travel to different regions and to
transport raw materials for pottery manufacture. Even pastes with minerals from local
sources can indicate costly signaling if the raw materials require a great deal of time or

71
labor investment to acquire. The latter would be plausible if local clays are rare or
vary in their quality spatially. It is also possible that pots were implicated in other
activities associated with social and economic aggrandizing behavior, such as feasting.
If vessels were used for such social tasks, then they would be expected to have
distinctive shapes, either shallow shapes with wide orifices for serving the contents or
specialized shapes suited to a particular consumption or processing use (e.g., cylindershaped vessels used to serve beverages in Mesoamerica). Wares used for serving or
processing exotic foods should bear organic residues of these non-local or rare foods.
Vessel porosity and heating use wear might be expected to vary depending on the
specific tasks it was used for. The single attribute which must be present in high
frequencies in order to infer any type of prestige function is decorative treatment, as it
is the one attribute that differentiates the prestige hypothesis from all others.
Socio-economic implications of pottery manufacture and use
The above hypotheses are logically related in various ways. The theoretical
links between food production and storage have empirical implications for ceramic
vessel assemblages. If one function of food production is to address temporal resource
then people may store surpluses in order to average such shortages over time. Vessel
attributes would form a bimodal distribution, indicating two basic vessel functions
clustered around food processing and storage. Assemblages may reflect trade-offs
between processing and storage functions: vessels may simultaneously display
evidence of thermal use-wear and porosity-limiting attributes. Pots may have been
used for processing activities not requiring direct heat, such as grinding in which case
pots may have use wear and manufacturing attributes such as scratches walls of
variable thickness (since the vessel would not need to effectively conduct heat).
It is also possible that food production/intensive plant processing were not
major strategies for foragers with pottery. Imported domesticates could have been a
component of forager diets, and could have been obtained from adjacent food
producing groups, possibly in exchange for local foods (Spielmann 1986). Sourcing
and residue data could support this if vessel pastes are from non local sources and

72
residues indicate non local domesticated foods. If storing food surplus was not a
common strategy, then groups might have dealt with temporal or spatial resource
shortages using a residentially mobile strategy. If so, the organic residue data may
reflect this by showing high frequencies of large animal residues.
Food production/intensive use of plants and storage may also be linked with
social and economic complexity (Cohen 1985). Complex social institutions may result
from competition, environmental and social circumscription, and reduced economic
options. These conditions occur when groups focus on temporally and spatially
variable resources due to population packing and subsequent reduced mobility.
Reduced mobility may affect the ability of groups to follow large-bodied resources
such as large game animals, and result in their increased reliance on r-selected
resources through time. In this scenario, ceramic vessels could be used to lower
processing costs of these resources, and vessels should show high frequencies of
thermal use, and high frequencies of starchy seed residues. Anthropologists have
argued that socio-political contexts affect and are affected by storage (Fitzhugh 2003).
Social elites can control surplus and direct its distribution. Ceramic vessels can play a
role in the redistribution of surplus as tools for feasting. Vessels used in such contexts
of public redistribution are expected to be highly decorated with wide orifices for their
role as elite serving containers. Distributions of decorative and size attributes across a
given ceramic assemblage may appear multimodal, indicating two or three groups of
vessels which are functionally different from one another. Frequent evidence of semipermanent to permanent settlement might be in the archaeological record (such as
postmolds or housefloors). Trade for exotic items other than pottery would also be
frequent in the archaeological record. Burials should indicate differing levels of grave
goods (including ceramic vessels) indicating differential social status. The
expectations presented here are evaluated in a case study located on the upper Texas
coastal plain (UTCP). In order to apply the models to the study area, it is necessary to
consider the particular nature and distribution of food resources, as well as cultural
information of this region.

CHAPTER 4: SELECTED SITES
In order assess hypotheses concerning hunter-gatherer pottery use and its
relationship to diet, mobility, and social/political behavior, sites from the upper Texas
coastal plain (UTCP) needed to meet certain criteria. Since this research is focused on
increasing understanding of mobility and subsistence practices, it was important to
select a variety of site types from different ecozones. Sites of different sizes were
selected using the reasoning that large and small sites may represent different
occupations in a seasonal round, or possibility different mobility strategies. For the
same reasons, it was also important to select sites representing different occupation
types (e.g., cemeteries, large shell midden sites, sites without shell middens). For
example, large sites may have been places where people congregated as part of their
settlement pattern, and possibly engaged in ceremonies or feasts. Sites in different
ecological zones were selected as well, in order to account for the possibility that
different ecological zones contained different settlement patterns, or that sites in
different zones were parts of the same settlement system. This was particularly
pertinent considering the existing idea that groups moved between inland and coastal
margin areas on a seasonal basis.
Analysis of ceramic assemblages from contemporaneous sites facilitates
analytical comparisons between assemblages, as well as the sites themselves. This
way, any differences between sites can be properly interpreted in terms of spatial
difference, rather than temporal change. While many existing collections of pottery in
this area are available for research, many are from sites which lack absolute dates, or
were not systematically excavated. Some sites have absolute dates (though not
necessarily precise) and sound recovery and documentation. Sites which appeared
contemporaneous were selected; the discussion of luminescence dates later in this
chapter indicates that all three of the selected sites were occupied at roughly the same
time, although some dates from two of the sites suggest earlier occupationsâor earlier
potteryâthan the radiocarbon dates.

75
Information on diet from individual sites can be used to assess the
conclusions from analysis of pottery assemblages. Therefore, sites with additional data
on diet, in the form of plant, animal, and human remains were selected. Botanical
remains are rare in archaeological sites in the region, and only a very few sites have
evidence of plant use. Animal remains are more common, although less so in sites
without shell (shell can alter soil chemistry and help preserve bone). The region does
have cemeteries, some of which have been excavated. Samples of human remains
from some of these cemeteries have been analyzed in dietary studies. Sites with
burials are also useful in addressing the prestige behavior hypothesis, it was important
to include sites which may yield detectable evidence of social ranking. Sites with
burials are ideal because the presence of status differences can be determined by
examining the amount and types of burial goods.
Ceramic assemblages were chosen from three of these well-documented sites:
41GV66, 41AU38, and 41LB4. All were chosen because they yielded radiocarbon
dates which fell into the Late Prehistoric Period (AD 1100-contact), which facilitated
analytical comparisons between them. In addition to their dates, each site had
particular aspects which promised to lend insight into testing the hypotheses. Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) is a large site with four cemeteries and was reported to have high
frequencies of decorated ceramics. Some sherds were noted to have decoration styles
similar to pottery styles in the Lower Mississippi Valley (Ricklis 1994). Excavations
at Honeycomb (41LB4) revealed nut fragments, and features thought to be
postmoldsâperhaps indicating some sort of structure related to settlement. Little
Bethlehem (41AU38) was chosen because it is located on the inland potion of the
upper Texas coastal plain and thus represents inland adaptations on the gulf coastal
plain. This site is less than a kilometer from the well-known Archaic Period Ernest
Witte site, which contains burials and grave goods sourced to regional trade networks,
indicating possible mobility and/or prestige activity.

76
41GV66 âMitchell Ridgeâ
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) is located on a relict beach ridge near the midpoint
of the axis which runs parallel to the length of Galveston Island, on the leeward side
(Figure 4.1). At 8-10 feet above sea level the site occupies one of the highest points on
the Island and overlooks the shallow inlet of Eckert Bayou, an old tidal pass that was
most likely filled in by sediment prior to occupation of the site (Ricklis 1994).
Lagoon-dwelling species in the shell hash underlying the site date to about 3483 BC
and suggest that that the site was adjacent to a quiet lagoon during human occupation.
Cultural materials were most likely deposited on the ridge and swale topography as it
was being filled in with eoalian sands and vegetation. The site is located on the
cultural boundaries of the historic Akokisa and Karankawa groups. It includes
occupation areas and four cemeteries dating from AD 700/800 to ca. AD 1660, and
has yielded over 25,000 sherdsâthe largest ceramic assemblage of any site in the
UTCP (Ricklis 1994). Radiocarbon dates of human remains, charcoal, and shell
suggest the most intensive occupation of the site occurred after AD 1250 (Ricklis
1994).
Roughly a kilometer long and more than half a kilometer wide, portions of the
site were first excavated by Rice University and the Houston Archeological Society
from 1974-1978. The Texas Archeological Society conducted its annual field school at
the site in 1978. More recent work was conducted by Coastal Archaeological
Research, Incorporated under the direction of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (Galveston District) after human remains were discovered during
construction of a pilot canal for a housing development. Under the direction of Robert
Ricklis, Coastal Archaeological Research crews carried out testing and excavation of
selected portions of the site between January and July of 1992. Coastal Archaeological
Research also conducted an analysis of field records and artifacts from the 1974-1978
excavations, concluding that much of the original provenience information had been
lost when the collections were re-housed in a local museum not long after the original

77
excavations (Ricklis 1994). Given this information, I decided to focus on sherds
collected from the more recent excavation in 1992.
In addition to the four discrete burial areas, the 1992 testing revealed high
concentrations of domestic refuse, especially in the northeastern portion of the site
known as the âBlock Excavationâ (Figure 4.2; see Figure 4.3 for a plan view of the
Block Excavation). This particular area roughly 200 meters southwest of the bayou
yielded the greatest density of artifacts and non-burial features on the site. I focused
my analysis on the sherds from this area, because it had a high density of artifacts with
good provenience. Concentrating on sherds from a domestic context also allowed me
to avoid using destructive analytical techniques on sherds which could have been
associated with mortuary practices. Provenience was tightly controlled in the block
excavation and as a result of this and overall sherd density it provided a large amount
of sherds with the best chronological control at the site. Shovel tests indicated that
cultural deposits in this area were approximately 20 centimeters below surface and
were contained in a dark brown fine sandy soil layer 15-20 centimeters thick (Rickis
1994; see Figure 4.4 for representative profiles). This cultural layer was capped by a
mainly sterile layer similar in color and texture and 15-20 centimeters thick. Below the
cultural layer was another sterile layer of light brown sand 10-15 centimeters thick,
which was underlain by a lighter colored sterile matrix of fine sand and shell hash
(Rickis 1994).
The Block Excavation covered a 72 square meter area comprised of contiguous
2 by 2 meter units. The upper 10 centimeters of sterile soil were removed by machine.
Workers then staked a grid; shovel skimmed the remaining five centimeters of sterile
soil, and used trowels to expose the cultural layer. This portion of the hand excavation
used a mixed strategy where the cultural matrix was initially removed as one layer,
and later in five centimeter arbitrary levels when it was discovered that some portions
of the block had a cultural layer thicker than previously thought (Ricklis field notes
1992). The cultural matrix was sieved through 1/8â screens. Flotation samples were

78
taken from in and around features, although they yielded no botanical material
except for small pieces of wood analysts could not identify. No carbonized plant
remains were recovered from the site.
The block excavation yielded radiocarbon dates from AD 1280-1440, as well
as 7,018 sherds and 12 features (Ricklis 1994). Features consisted of shell-lined
hearths, unlined hearths, an unburned pit, and a semicircular depression almost four
meters square containing a shell and pottery-lined hearth, which Ricklis suggested
might have been a house floor (see Figure 4.3 for locations and types of features).
Artifacts other than pottery included stone tools, pumice and sandstone cobbles, bone
tools including an unusual scraper/smoother made from a bison scapula, bird bone
beads and whistles, worked shell, 510 pieces of asphaltum (tar that occurs naturally in
the area), and five pieces of worked glass interpreted to be associated with a later
occupation to the south of the block excavation (Ricklis 1994:86-87).
Faunal materials recovered include 6,343 fish bones and 1,885 mammal bones.
Species represented in the block and throughout the site include large mammals such
as deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and a few bison bones (Bison bison), as well as
smaller mammals such as coyote (Canis latrans), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and
hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus). Birds and reptiles are also present (see report
for full species list). The majority of bones (75%) are fish and include gar (Lepisostens
sp.), black drum (Pogonais cronis/Archosargus robatocephalus), sheepshead
(Archosargus probatocephalus), sea catfish (Arius felis), sea trout (Cynoscion
nebulosis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata), as well as shark teeth and a stingray spine.
Shellfish are present in smaller quantities, with 95% of the shellfish sample comprised
of oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Seasonality studies of the oyster indicate that 26%
of the oysters were harvested in the autumn and 48% in the winter. Analysis of nonceramic remains led Ricklis to conclude that the site had been occupied principally in
the fall and winter, and that while terrestrial remains indicated contact with the

79
mainland, food procurement was geared primarily toward fishing (Ricklis 1994).
The majority of terrestrial mammal bones are deer and hispid cotton rat.
Analysis of human remains and associated grave goods provides useful
information on interregional interaction, social complexity, and diet. The oldest burial
dates to about AD 84 and is temporally distant from the other burials and materials
dated at the site, most of which are suspected to be AD 1250 or younger (Ricklis
1994). Grave goods include lithics, bone and antler tools, pumice cobbles, shell and
shell beads, engraved whistles made from whooping crane bones, red and yellow
ochre, otoliths, shark teeth, and small, rounded clusters of pebbles and drum teeth that
may have been parts of rattles (Ricklis 1994). Protohistoric and historic burials contain
European trade beads and pieces of metal. Prehistoric burials have few goods which
could not be obtained locally. Shell bead manufacture could have been timeconsuming and therefore a way of displaying status and/or wealth (Ricklis 1994). It is
interesting to note that none of the burials contain pottery, except one particular sherd
which appears to be an accidental intrusion of adjacent refuse (Ricklis 1994). Grave
goods are not evenly distributed over the burial population; adult male burials are
more likely to have goods and in a greater variety than adult female burials. Some
children and subadult burials contain grave goods. Since not all burials are
contemporaneous with one another, it is difficult to determine if there is any spatial
differentiation in the distribution of grave goods. Therefore, Ricklis concluded he
could not address the possibility that burial groups were spatially divided according to
status.
Human remains from the cemetery portion of the site were the focus of dietary
studies (Huebner 1994; Powell 1994). Dental data indicate that Late Prehistoric
individuals had more enamel wear and dental attrition than later groups, possibly from
a gritty diet of berries (many of which contain hard parts), nuts, and hard seeds or
maybe food not thoroughly cleaned. Some dental polishing is present, similar to that
of known mastication of fibrous plants such as roots. Subsequent historic burials

80
contain individuals with less severe enamel damage and dental attrition, but more
caries and dental calculus, possibly indicating a change it diet and/or food preparation
(Powell 1994). Stable isotope analyses conducted by Huebner indicate that as a group,
prehistoric individuals had diets comprised of 2/3 to 3/4 marine foods while diets of
historic individuals are comprised of 1/3 to 1/ 2 marine foods (Huebner 1994). It is
also interesting to note that Powellâs conclusion that the differences between
prehistoric and historic burial groups at Mitchell Ridge in terms of skeletal
morphology and diet may be due to the incursion of non-local people in the area
during the historic period, or from intermarriage with Europeans, although he does not
rule out the possibility that there was dietary change to maize or vegetable horticulture
in the UTCP during this period.
The Mitchell Ridge pottery assemblage appears predominantly comprised of
local wares, although some UTCP design styles do resemble lower Mississippi valley
culture historical types (e.g., Coles Creek Incised, Mazique Incised, and Harrison
Bayou Incised) that Ricklis posits were local copies of these wares. The 1970âs
excavations recovered two sherds that appear non-local (Caddoan or lower Mississippi
Valley) in design and construction. In addition to the shell and sherd-lined hearth in
the block, other parts of the site yielded features with and without pottery which may
have implications for assessing the storage hypothesis. One pottery vessel was buried
in a pit with unarticulated fish and other animal skeletons in it, possibly indicating
storage of these items (or disposal as refuse). Another feature was comprised of an
ash-stained pit with faunal remains, and could possibly have been a storage pit
(Ricklis 1994). Postmolds are also present at the site, and one configuration is
semicircular, with little debris in or around it, similar to ethnohistoric descriptions of
fish-drying structures used by groups living further south on the Texas coast (Ricklis
1994). Other possible functions of the structure could be a charnel house (given the
presence of secondary burials on the site) or sleeping quarters (Ricklis 1994).

81
41LB4 âHoneycombâ
Honeycomb is a small shell midden (40x15 meters) habitation site located 40
miles east of Houston, on a tributary linking the current channel of lower Trinity River
with one of its older channels (Figure 4.5; Ensor 1995). Just south of the modern town
of Liberty, the site is in the vicinity of the short-lived Mission Nuestra Senora de la
Luz del Orcoquisac (1756-1771). Initially tested in 1969 and 1971 by Lawrence Aten,
the site is on the National Register as part of the Orcoquisac Archeological District.
This delta area is laced with ponds, brackish and freshwater marshes, swamps, and
wooded bottomlands, and is fringed by grassy uplands. Radiocarbon dates indicate the
site was occupied ca. AD 1200-1670 and inhabitants probably lived in an immediate
environment similar to the one at present, although the course of the river shifted
during the span of occupation and most likely changed the salinity of the surrounding
water which may have affected the types of aquatic species present (Nordt and Jacob
1995). The bulk of the midden was most likely created between AD 1250 and 1500
(Ensor 1995). Three sherds from Test Unit 1 yielded dates which fell into this range
(Figure 4.6; Table 4.1).
The site was most recently tested by Geo-Marine Incorporated as part of a
contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District to
delineate and determine the integrity of sites within the Wallisville Lake Project Area,
a large water control project. The focus of the work was primarily on documenting
historic occupations. During November and December of 1993 and January of 1994,
Geo-Marine crews excavated three test units at the site totaling eight square meters
(see Figure 4.7 for location of test units and all shovel tests). All cultural matrix was
water screened through 1/4â mesh. Two square meters from Test Unit 1 were screened
using 1/8â mesh in an effort to look for historic trade beads. Trenching and auguring
were also used to delineate the boundaries of the site. Work revealed that the site was
overlain by about 90 centimeters of very recent (20th century) overburden (see Figure
4.8 and 4.9 for extent of overburden). Subsequently test units were opened by

82
shoveling the overburden and removing subsequent layers with hand tools. Site
stratigraphy was divided into three zones; the first of which was comprised of a very
dark silty clay averaging 12 centimeters in thickness with occasional fragments of
shell and pottery. Zone two was the shell midden with a black silt clay matrix which
ranged from trace amounts of shell to 27 centimeters thick. Most of the cultural
materials were contained in this layer. Excavations were terminated in zone three (a
soil similar to that in Zone 2) due to the lack of shell and artifacts, and the fact that the
water table was reachedâdespite efforts to siphon water off with a bilge pump (Ensor
1995). Some portions of Zone 2 in Test Unit 3 contained only isolated concentrations
of shell. In some places sherds were present but not the shell midden.
Excavations yielded 3,035 sherds, 46 lithic tools and 1, 290 flakes, and nine
features. Sherds exhibited greater variability in form and decoration than other sites
investigated in the area, leading Ensor to conclude that perhaps the site was formed by
longer occupations, and/or higher populations (Ensor 1995). Lithic materials appear to
be mostly from local river gravels; a couple of pieces of chert and quartzite may be
linked to central and northeast Texas sources. Features consisted of three âsurface
hearthsââmounded clusters of pottery, bone, lithics, burned and unburned shell (see
Figure 4.10 for location of these features). Two clusters of pottery bone and shell were
documented, as well as two small, round depressions filled with cultural debris
interpreted to be postmolds. Two basin-shaped features with pottery, bone, lithics,
burned shell and ash were also documented.
Fauna recovered from the site include a variety of fresh and saltwater fish: gar
(Lepisosteus sp.) bowfin (Amia calva), various species of catfish (Ariidae/Aurius
felis/Bagre marinus), perch or bass (Perciformes), black and red drum (Pogonais
cromis and Sciaenops ocellata), croaker (Micropogonais sp.), freshwater drum
(Aplodinotus grunniens), and sheepshead or porgie (Sparidae). Alligator (Alligator
mississippiensis), and various species of turtle and snake are present, as well as duck
(Anatidae), cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.), swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), squirrel

83
(Sciurus sp.), beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyron lotor), deer (Odocoileus sp.), and unidentified carnivores. Bones from
several of these species were burned (Shaffer 1995). Although little pollen was found,
carbonized plants included a charred fragment of hickory nut, leading the analyst to
posit possible hickory nut processing at the site (Dering 1995). Seeds of the pepper
vine (Ampelopsis sp.) and bedstraw (Galium sp.) were also preserved, and are known
to have medicinal uses among historic peoples in the southeast. Charred fragments of
wood were also identified: maple (Acer sp.), hickory (Cayra sp.), hackberry (Celtis
sp.), holly (Ilex sp.), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), oak (Quercus sp.), sweetgum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), cypress/juniper (Taxodium/Juniperus), basswood (Tilia
sp.) and elm (Ulmus sp.) were burned at the site.

41AU38 âLittle Bethlehemâ
Little Bethlehem is located on the inland portion of the coastal plain on the
edge of an old bluff-like meander scar of the Brazos River overlooking the riverâs
floodplain, approximately 70 kilometers east-northeast of Houston and immediately
north of the town of Wallis (Figure 4.11). A shallow, unstratified site with a single
radiocarbon date of AD 1480+/-80, it is one of several sites in this area located on the
bluff (Hall 1981).
Little Bethlehem is 900 meters from the well-known predominantly Middle
Archaic-Early Prehistoric cemetery site Ernest Witte (41AU38), which was the source
for one of the few studies of dietary bone chemistry in the area (Huebner and Boutton
1992). Little Bethlehem is located 700 meters from Allens Creek, an intermittent
stream with six recorded sites on its banks. Little Bethlehem rests on a gradual slope
leading down to a drainage notch in the bluff line and was occupied when the Brazos
switched from the eastern side of the valley to its present course (Hall 1981).
Prehistoric occupation of the inland coastal plain appears most dense in the stream and
river valleys, which are heavily wooded with pecan, oak, and elm. These areas are

84
immediately adjacent to oxbow lakes and swampy areas, a potential source for
waterfowl and game (Hall 1981). Upland prairies have few signs of prehistoric
occupation, except for small, infrequent scatters of artifacts (Hall 1981). This area of
the UTCP lies in the historic range of the Tonkawa, Karankawa, and possibly
Atakapa. Hall notes that the lithic and ceramic artifacts resemble culture historical
types found around Galveston Bay. There is no evidence of direct contact with
Europeans or Anglo-Americans at Little Bethlehem.
The 1974 Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) excavations of the site
uncovered debris characteristic of domestic occupation. A former owner of the land
recalled seeing human remains eroding from the bluff at some point previously (Hall
1981). The site was recorded in 1972 when the TASP survey crew noticed cultural
materials eroding from the top layer of soil of the bluff. It was subsequently excavated
in 1974 as part of a project to mitigate the effects of a proposed nuclear generating
station operated by Houston Lighting and Power Company. Workers placed a grid on
the site and excavated 14 1x2 meter units and one 1x1 meter unit in 10 centimeter
arbitrary levels, sieving all matrix through 1/4â screens (Hall 1981; see Figure 4.12 for
location of excavation units). No natural stratigraphy appeared to exist; probably a
result of modern plowing activity and post-depositional argilliturbation of the Lake
Charles Clay (a soil formed from the underlying Pleistocene Beaumont Clay) in which
deposits were located. The cultural matrix averaged 40 centimeters in thickness and
extended 40-50 centimeters below the surface, terminating at the Beaumont Clay (see
Figure 4.13 for a representative profile). In addition, four backhoe trenches were cut to
determine the boundaries of the site, which is about 130 meters on its longest axis and
40-50 meters in width. Trenching and excavation exposed a total of 2400 square
meters. The northwest portion of the site cuts across sandy loam deposits, which are
commonly the result of gully-like washes filling with colluvium as they drain the
prairie uplands to the river. Cultural materials have subsequently been found below

85
such sandy deposits at other sites, leading Hall to conclude in retrospect that older
cultural deposits may have been below the apparent colluvium.
Excavation yielded 877 sherds and 31 sediment samples from controlled
vertical and horizontal contexts. Five features were uncovered, including refuse piles,
concentrations of burned mussel shell, and clusters of sandstone cobbles and burned
clay nodules. These burned clay nodules ring clusters of burned bone fragments from
deer, raccoon, snake, and fish, combined with charcoal and a few sherds. Whether
these nodules are the same as the âclay ballsâ typically described from more recent
excavations on inland sites is unclear (Moore 1995). It is still not clear to
archaeologists working in the inland UTCP today if these clay ball objects were used
for food preparation tasks, and whether or not they are associated with pottery use.
Other tools include a variety of arrow points made from local cobbles which can easily
be found on sandbars of the Brazos, and six marine shell whorls, some apparently used
as pendants. Five of these shell whorls were previously recovered by the landowner
who claimed they were associated with the human remains he observed eroding from
the bluff (Hall 1981).
Thus, portions of Little Bethlehem may have contained burials at some point.
But the site most likely had other roles in the settlement pattern as well. Hall notes that
there was a greater variety of lithic debris at this site than the others around it, and
hypothesizes that Little Bethlehem was a site of comparatively intense lithic
manufacturing. One cobble fragment is described as a possible grinding stone, but no
other possible food processing tools are present, except for pottery. Many sherds have
bone inclusions. Bone-tempered ware are known and described as âLeon Plainâ in
central and inland south Texas and sometimes âOrcoquisac Plainâ closer to the coastal
margin. The original analysis of the sherds revealed wares with a combination of bone
and grog temper not seen in the area before (Hall 1981). Fauna recovered from the site
include a variety of freshwater fish: bowfin (Amia calva), gar (Lepisosteus sp.), catfish
(Ictalurus sp.), bass (Morone sp.), and drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), as well as small

86
amphibians and reptiles. Blue goose (Chen caerulescens), duck (Anatidae sp.), and
coot (Fulica Americana) are present. Large mammals include deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) and the radius, carpal and tooth of a horse, and a bobcat (Lynx rufus)
mandible. No bison bones were found. Smaller mammals include: opossum (Didelphis
marsupialis), cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), squirrel (Sciurus sp.), gopher (Geomys
bursaris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (Lord 1981).
The majority of freshwater mussel represented is Ligumia subrostrata.
While no human remains were recovered from Little Bethlehem, a small group
of Late Prehistoric (AD 920-1480) burials was excavated at the nearby Ernest Witte
site (41AU36), and one individual Late Prehistoric burial was unearthed at Leonard K
(41AU37). None of the Late Prehistoric Period burials at either site had grave goods,
unlike the more than 200 Archaic and Early Prehistoric Period (2600 BC-AD 950)
burials at Ernest Witte, which had boatstones similar in source and manufacture to
those found in the lower Mississippi Valley. Some of those early burials include
corner tang knives, which have a wide distribution throughout the central and southern
plains. Marine shells are also present, although the distribution of these species ranges
from relatively local Texas waters to Florida and the eastern seaboard, so it is difficult
to determine how distant their source ultimately was. Burials at Ernest Witte after AD
200 have fewer of these exotic artifacts, leading Hall to conclude that while inland
groups may have participated in interregional exchange networks in the Archaic and
Early Prehistoric periods, their social, political, and/or economic spheres contracted by
the Late Prehistoric.

Luminescence dates
Successful interpretation of pottery use and production depends upon accurate
dating. Without sound dates, it is impossible to distinguish temporal from
contemporaneous differences in pottery use and production between the selected sites.
While the chosen sites are roughly contemporaneous with one another, some of their

87
radiocarbon dates are problematic, as is often the case in this area. One of the most
common materials used for radiocarbon dating shell-bearing sites on the UTCP is
Rangia cuneata shell. Marine reservoir effects on Rangia shell dates appear to be
highly variable throughout the UTCP (Aten 1999). Charcoal is rare in most sites, and
in some cases recovered charcoal has been combined from different strata in a given
site simply to obtain enough material for a radiocarbon sample. A seriation of pottery
types is commonly used in the area (Aten 1983), but the majority of wares in this
study are plain and lack the stylistic attributes necessary for a robust seriation (Dunnell
1978). Thermoluminescence is an ideal dating method for research on the production
and function of pottery because it directly dates the material and event of interest
(Feathers 1997). Not only is thermoluminescence dating of pottery routine (Feathers
1997), it is highly practical in this area where marine reservoir effects on shell are
poorly understood and sherds greatly outnumber charcoal. Recent advances in
luminescence methods and instrumentation have improved the accuracy and precision
of the technique. The accuracy of luminescence can be greater than radiocarbon in that
the luminescence produces calendar dates which do not require calibration (Feathers
2000). Most importantly for the purposes of this study, luminescence dating offers the
only direct means of determining when pots were manufactured and used on the upper
Texas coastal plain. Each of the sites in the study has reported radiocarbon dates from
previous studies. Radiocarbon methods require an associational argument between the
organic material being dated and pottery, which negatively affects the accuracy of our
understanding of the timing of pottery use and manufacture (Feathers 2000).
Luminescence dating is based on the fact that some minerals found in
crystalline minerals found in archaeological materials (such as pottery, sediments, and
lithics) have microscopic structural imperfections which trap free electrons. In the case
of pottery, the trapped electrons are released when pots are heated above 500 degrees
Celsius, a situation which occurs during manufacture and/or use. The release of
electrons from these âtrapsâ essentially resets the luminescence âclockâ of the material

88
to zero. After this event, traps begin to refill as a function of natural radioactivity. In
the laboratory, the traps are emptied again by heating samples above 500 degrees
Celsius (in the case of thermoluminescence) or exposing them to light (in the case of
optically stimulated luminescence). The intensity of the luminescence signal is
proportional to the accumulated radiation dose. In order to relate this signal to time,
two quantities must be assessed. The first, called equivalent dose, is an estimate of the
amount of absorbed radiation does required to produce the natural luminescence
signal. It is divided by the second, the dose rate, to determine the age. The dose rate is
measured from current radioactivity of the sample and its immediate surroundings, on
the assumption that the dose rate has not changed significantly through time, due to
the long half lives of the relevant radionuclides. After this equivalent dose rate is
determined, the radioactivity of surrounding sediments is measured using a sample of
soil in which the object was found. Dividing the first dose rate by the second produces
the age of the materials being dated (see Aitken 1985 for a detailed overview of the
method).
Sherds in close proximity to one another on a given site (preferably in the same
unit) were chosen for dating. Choosing sherds with similar locations facilitates
interpretation of the age of the site and the pottery. For example, dates from sherds
from different levels of the same unit can be another means of assessing the accuracy
of the dates: if one or some dates are out of stratigraphic order, then perhaps they are
problematic. In order to obtain dose rates for the surrounding sediments, sediment
samples were taken from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4). In the
case of Little Bethlehem (41AU38), sediment samples were originally collected from
each arbitrary level of excavation units during the 1974 testing. Small portions of
these samples (100 grams or less) were used in the current study.
Both thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dates were
obtained for the samples. Thermoluminescence measurements were made with a
Daybreak 1100 reader using a 9635Q photomultiplier. Optically stimulated

89
luminescence dates were obtained using a RisÃ¸ TL-DA-15 reader. Both methods
were used because they are independent of one another. Thus, one can be used to
check the accuracy of the other. When dates from different methods on the same
material do not agree, it is commonly due to the thermoluminescence signal fading
(which occurs when trapped electrons are lost over time) while the optically
stimulated luminescence signal does not. If fading has occurred, the age of the sample
will be underestimated unless a correction is made. For this reason, fading was tested
for in these samples. Dates from both luminescence methods may also disagree for
other currently unknown reasons. Using both methods can help identify a potential
problem with one of the analyses.
Radiocarbon dates (2-sigma calibrated) were originally reported from Mitchell
Ridge (Ricklis 1994), Honeycomb (Ensor 1995), and Little Bethlehem (Hall 1981).
Their ranges are illustrated in Figure 4.6, along with the luminescence dates obtained
in this study.
Luminescence dates were obtained from three sherds from the block
excavation portion of Mitchell Ridge (41GV66; Figure 4.3). Sherds were selected
from successive layers of unit N0E0. A grog-tempered, asphaltum-coated sherd from a
depth of 5-10 centimeters yielded a date between AD 1239 and 1357 (UW 1334),
which falls within the distribution of radiocarbon dates for the block excavation potion
of the site (Figure 4.2; Table 4.1). The sandy paste sherds from the lower depths of the
same unit yielded older luminescence dates. The sherd from the 10-15 centimeter
depth dates between 123 BC and AD 371 (UW 1335), the other from 15-20
centimeters dates between 172 BC and AD 702 (UW 1336; Figure 4.2; Table 4.1). It is
not clear if these older dates indicate that pottery was being used in the block
excavation portion of 41GV66 this early in time. Both sandy paste sherds yielded
optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates older than the geologic formations of
the area, although it is unclear why this is the case (Feathers, Appendix A). These

90
anomalously old OSL dates from these two samples are not reliable, therefore only
the thermoluminescence dates were considered.
The sherd from the 15-20 centimeter layer (UW 1336) produced a
thermoluminescence (TL) date which was corrected for fading. If the fading correction
is not used, the date would be around AD 700. With the correction, the date is
265Â±437 BC. No other dates from the block excavation are this old, although dates
from other portions of the site overlap with the luminescence dates from the block
excavation. Ricklis reports that one radiocarbon date on human bone from the 1970âs
era excavations is between 45 BC and AD 310 (Ricklis 1994), which overlaps with
UW 1335 and UW 1336. Additional dates from human remains at the site range
between AD 670 and AD 1215 (Ricklis 1994). Thus, while old when compared to the
other dates from the block excavation, UW 1335 and UW 1336 are not anomalously
old within the context of the entire site. While these early luminescence dates could be
slightly older than the Early Ceramic Period dates for the UTCP (AD 100-425) they
overlap with the Early Ceramic component dates at Eagles Ridge (41CH252; Ensor
and Ricklis 1998). Given the current information, OSL dates for the two sandy paste
sherds are problematic, yet it is possible that the TL dates from these represent older
occupations. As it stands, further dates need to be obtained to determine if in fact
sherds from the block excavation predate AD 1052.
In contrast to the sherds from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), three sherds from
Honeycomb (41LB4) yielded luminescence dates very similar to the radiocarbon dates
obtained from the 1993-94 Geo-Marine testing. A grog-tempered sherd (UW 1338)
and a sandy paste sherd (UW 1339) from the 10-15 centimeter level of Unit 1 yielded
dates AD 1298-1422 and AD 1305-1457, respectively (Figures 4.2, 4.9 and 4.10;
Table 4.1;). A sandy paste sherd from the 15-20 centimeter level of the same unit (UW
1337) dated between AD 1168 and AD 1270 (Figure 4.2; Table 4.1). Radiocarbon
dates from charcoal samples in the 10-15 centimeter and 20-25 centimeter levels of
Unit 1 closely bracket the luminescence dates.

91
A single radiocarbon date from Little Bethlehem (41AU38) lies between AD
1400-AD1560, leading investigators to conclude that it did have a Late Prehistoric
component (Hall 1981). During the present study, luminesence dates obtained from
four sandy paste sherds from consecutive layers of Test Pit 1 gave older dates (Figure
4.2; Table 4.1). Sherds which produced these dates overlay two lower arbitrary levels
containing Ensor and Lange dart points but no pottery. Given the styles of the dart
points and the absence of pottery, the lower portion of the site was interpreted to be a
Middle or Late Archaic occupation (Hall 1981). Two sherds from the 20-30 centimeter
level of Test Pit 1 yielded dates of AD 913-1065 (UW 1333) and AD 937-1177 (UW
1332; Figures 4.2 and 4.13; Table 4.1). UW 1333 is an OSL date, as the TL date most
likely has fading. UW 1332 is a TL date, as the OSL date is anomalously old
(Feathers, Appendix A). The other two dates are problematic, given the current
knowledge of the age of ceramics in the inland portion of the Texas coastal plain, but
at least one is not completely implausible. The date from UW 1330 places ceramics on
the site between 90 BC and AD 318, before the commonly understood appearance of
ceramics on inland sites (around AD 550-950; Hall 1981). This early date was
produced by OSL; the TL date is between AD 1040 and 1336. While the TL date is
probably subject to fading, it is much more plausible given what we know about the
ages of ceramic vessels in the inland area, the radiocarbon date from this site, and the
fact that the sherd comes from the level above the earlier dates (10-20 centimeters;
Figure 4.2). The fourth date (UW 1331) is relatively old (7 BC-AD 303) but cannot be
easily dismissed. While the TL date of UW 1331 is affected by fading, the OSL date is
derived from excellent data (Feathers, Appendix A). The problem with the OSL date
on UW1331 is that it is simply older than the known age of pottery on the interior
Texas coastal plain. Given the Archaic Period artifact assemblages in the lower levels
of this site, it is possible that this early pottery date is accurate. While a single date
may not cause us to revise our current understanding of pottery on the inland portion
of the Texas coastal plain, UW 1331 warrants further consideration and research.

CHAPTER 5: ASESSING HYPOTHESES USING MORPHOLOGICAL
AND USE WEAR DATA
Three sets of hypotheses on possible functions of ceramic vessels used by
Upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP) hunter-gatherers were developed and discussed in
Chapter 3. One set of hypotheses addresses the potential uses of pottery as food
processing containers. In this set, there are two hypotheses: 1) pots were used as tools
for intensive processing of domesticated and/or wild plant foods, which in turn might
indicate some level of food production. 2) Pots may have been used as tools to process
meat from large-bodied resources. A second set of hypotheses posits that pots could
also have been used as storage vessels, either to store foods as part of a low-mobility
settlement strategy, or store foods as part of a high-mobility storage strategy. A third
line of reasoning hypothesizes that pots were objects primarily for creating and
maintaining socio-political prestige. In order to test these three sets of hypotheses, I
examined pottery assemblages from three sites on the UTCP: Mitchell Ridge
(41GV66), located on the leeward side of Galveston Island; Honeycomb (41LB4),
which straddles upland and lowland environments near the coastal margin, and Little
Bethlehem (41AU38), located on the inland portion of the Texas gulf coastal plain
near the lower Brazos River. These three assemblages were analyzed using three sets
of methods: non-destructive analyses of manufacturing and use-wear characteristics,
mineral sourcing of non-clay inclusions in sherds, and organic residue analysis of
lipids contained in vessel walls. This chapter discusses how the above hypotheses
were assessed using manufacturing and use-wear characteristics on sherds from three
archaeological sites on the upper Texas coastal plain.

Analysis of vessel function
Archaeologists have commonly used three methods in their efforts to better
understand the function of ceramic vessels (as well as other artifacts): the physical
location of the pots themselves, how the pots were constructed, and direct evidence of

107
how they were used. Researchers traditionally investigate the physical contexts of
pottery, (e.g., within burials, domestic contexts, or association with food processing
tools) in order to infer behavior from these patterns. Doing so can be problematic in
light of post-depositional alteration and other factors (see Feathers 1990 for a full
discussion). Inferring vessel function and use from archaeological sites is particularly
problematic in many hunter-gatherer archaeological records, including the UTCP.
Physical contexts of ceramic vessel production (such as kilns and wasters) are quite
rare in the archaeological record of hunter-gatherers in general, and are nonexistent in
the archaeology of the UTCP. Much of UTCP pottery occurs in domestic areas of
sites, but the specific nature of these contexts is often difficult to interpret (see Feature
110-A from Mitchell Ridge for a notable exception of a sherd and shell-lined hearth).
In order to determine how UTCP vessels were made and used, data must be gathered
from the vessels themselves (Costin 1991). Thus, the remainder of this chapter is
devoted to describing how the above hypotheses were assessed using manufacturing
characteristics and use wear data obtained directly from sherds.

Analyzing pottery construction
A common approach to understanding vessel function entails investigating
how pots are constructed to understand how they functioned (e.g., Braun 1987; Hally
1986; Juhl 1995; Pierce 2005; Reid 1990; Rye 1976; Schiffer and Skibo 1992).
Previous research has provided much information on pottery function, particularly
food preparation and storage. This research is predicated on the idea that certain
aspects of the manufacture of a given tool (in this case pottery) can measurably affect
its suitability for a task. Thus, pots intended for particular tasks are predicted to have
attributes which enhance their performance in this task. It is important to realize that
while particular attributes may be optimal for a given task, they are subject to
constraints of materials, time, and prior knowledge. Nonetheless, analysis of pottery
manufacture is a viable means of investigating vessel function, particularly when

108
paired with other analytical methods such as use-wear. Four groups of attributes
are particularly useful to focus on when looking at vessel function in terms of food
processing and storage: vessel wall thickness, other aspects of vessel morphology
(including vessel shape and size), types and sizes of non-plastic inclusions, and
presence, type, and distribution of surface treatments.
Vessel wall thickness and uniformity of thickness affects a potâs performance
over heat in several ways. The thickness of walls can determine how well the vessel
conducts heat, how resistant the vessel is to mechanical stress, and how resistant the
vessel is to thermal stress. Thermal conductivity is defined as the ability to conduct
heat from one face of the vessel to another (outside to inside), and can be measured as
the time it takes for the temperature to change between the outside and the inside walls
(Braun 1983). Research has indicated that on average, thin-walled vessels are best able
to withstand the stress caused by sudden, extreme changes in temperatureâsuch as
coming into and out of a cooking fire (Braun 1983). The degree of uniformity of wall
thickness with a given vessel can also affect its performance over direct heat. This is
because thinner portions of the wall have a less pronounced thermal gradient than
thick portions. Therefore, if vessel walls are not uniform in thickness, thermallyinduced stress becomes localized when the vessel is heated or cooled (Rice 1987).
Researchers have argued that thin-walled vessels not only reduce vessel failure during
heating tasks but reduce fuel consumption, presumably because they heat more
efficiently than thicker-walled pots (Schiffer and Skibo 1992). For storage purposes,
thick-walled vessels would be better able to absorb mechanical shock without
distorting or failing (Braun 1983), although they can also be useful in preventing
contents of a pot from boiling over, especially when simmering foods (Pierce 2005).
Constructing larger vessels with fairly wide orifices may prevent boilovers as well
(Pierce 2005).
Vessel morphology can affect the performance of a pot in terms of storage. For
example, overall vessel size may be implicated with storage functions, with fairly

109
large vessels being useful for long-term storage. Smaller vessels may offer a larger
volume to surface area ratio which could enhance performance during heating tasks
(Juhl 1995). Smaller vessels may also be more useful than larger ones for short-term
storage, or storing foods which spoil quickly (Juhl 1995). Research indicates that
vessel shape (curved or angular) can also have an effect on a potâs performance over
heat. Such rounded forms decrease localized points of stress. For example, research
indicates that rounded base forms perform more effectively over heat, rather than more
angular forms such as flat-bottomed bases (Braun 1983, Rye 1976). Heating
effectiveness of a vessel can also be enhanced by restricting the size of the orifice and
therefore reducing heat loss through evaporation (Hally 1986; Linton 1944). We can
expect this quality to be selected by prehistoric potters in cases where it was important
to bring the contents of the pot to a boil without the vessel boiling dry quickly.
Nonetheless, pots used for boiling would not be expected to have openings so narrow
that there was a significant risk of the contents boiling over. Furthermore vessels used
for any sort of food processing using heatâwhether boiling, simmering, or parchingâ
would have to have orifices at least wide enough to fit a hand or a utensil through, in
order to access the contents (Hally 1986).
Research on the effects of non-plastic inclusions on ceramic vessel
performance has implications for assessing hypotheses concerning cooking and
storage functions of pottery. Non-plastic inclusions including temper type and
concentration, as well as the size and frequency of pores in the vessel body can affect
the response of the vessel to mechanical and thermal stressors (Tite et al. 2001). The
strength of a vessel affects its ability to retain its contents. Thus, strength is an
important quality for vessels used for cooking and/or storage. Vessels with high
strength have higher resistance to mechanical stressors. Research indicates that vessels
with high strength are created with low amounts of temper and high firing
temperatures (Tite et al. 2001). There are two components to thermal stress which can
affect the initiation and propagation of cracks in vessel walls: 1) differential expansion

110
and contraction of vessel walls during temperature changes; 2) differential thermal
expansion of temper particles and clay matrix (Tite et al. 2001). Various minerals
expand at different rates, but quartz, the most common mineral in many ceramic
bodies expands at a much higher rate than the vessel body (Rye 1976). In contrast,
empirical tests indicate that grog has a similar thermal expansion rate to the vessel
body, as do limestone and shell (Rye 1976; Steponaitis 1984). Yet grog temper is less
resistant to crack propagation (Tite et al. 2001). The size and frequency of mineral and
grog inclusions can affect the thermal performance of a vessel as well (Rye 1976). For
example, large grog particles can reduce the thermal stress gradients in vessel walls,
while smaller quartz inclusions may reduce the amount of thermal stress on the vessel
during heating tasks (Steponaitis 1984). Experimental research indicates that vessels
created with high amounts of temper and fired at low temperatures have greater
resistance to thermal stress (Tite et al. 2001). Pores are created from the loss of
organic material from the vessel walls during firing, leaving voids. Vessel porosity is
also affected by differential expansion of paste constituents, the packing of paste
particles, and firing temperature. Pores may not only increase resistance to mechanical
shock but may also make the vessel more resistant to crack propagation (Juhl 1995;
Rye 1976). Porous voids encompassing quartz grains may possibly accommodate
expansion of the grains, thereby enhancing the performance of a sand-tempered vessel
over heat (Woods 1986).
Surface treatments on ceramic vessels can also provide information on vessel
use. Surface treatments are usually associated with utilitarian functions of pots, and
are set apart from decoration. Decorative surface treatmentsâthose which have no
impact on a vesselâs performanceâcan indicate the degree of labor invested in vessel
production. However, some attributes may be both utilitarian and decorative. Many of
the surface treatments described above cannot be readily assigned to functional or
decorative categories. Covering the vessel walls with a sealant, applying a slip to
them, or burnishing them can be decorative techniques, but can also be used to limit

111
the permeability of a pot. Surface treatments such as combing and cordmarking
can be used to roughen the exterior surface of a vessel making it easier to handle when
wet (Pierce 2005).
Previous research indicates that the liquid storage properties of a vessel can be
improved by applying sealants and/or by burnishing vessel walls (Juhl 1995). Resin
coatings can reduce the permeability of the vessel and can be applied to help a vessel
retain liquids or to minimize damage by abrasion (Skibo 1992; Rice 1987). There is
some experimental evidence that sealants and other surface treatments such as slipping
and polishing can also enhance the heating properties of ceramic vessels (Schiffer
1990). While surface treatments on the exterior portions of vessel walls also limit
permeability, resin applied to the vessel interiors is especially effective in lowering the
amount of water which can pass from the interior to the exterior vessel wall and turn
to steam. Thus, pots with surface treatments limiting permeability bring their contents
to a boil more quickly on average than untreated vessels. In some experimental cases,
vessels with high permeability fail to boil water at all (Skibo and Blinman 1999).
Vessels with permeability-limiting surface treatments tend to lose less water and
therefore do not need to be monitored and refilled as frequently during the heating
process as frequently as vessels whose permeability is not limited by these means.
Unlike slipped and polished surfaces, resin coatings on the interior walls are not
subject to thermal spalling (Schiffer 1990). Surface treatments such as burnishing can
also reduce vessel porosity.

Analyzing direct evidence of vessel use
Although looking at a finished product and working back through the
manufacturing stages can be useful in addressing questions about vessel function, it is
also important to approach these studies with the understanding that prehistoric
solutions to engineering problems may very well have involved trade-offs (e.g.,
creating a more narrow orifice diameter in a cooking pot to make the ware less

112
vulnerable in the drying stages before firing). Thus, some attributes of vessel
manufacture may be affected by multiple considerations. Furthermore, the potential
function of a vessel may or may not be the same as what it was actually used for.
While archaeologists can better understand function of a vessel by observing aspects
of its design, observing physical indications left on vessels through their use can be
combined with information on vessel construction in order to create more robust
interpretations of vessel use. Use-wear studies have been common in ceramic function
studies for a few decades (e.g., Hally 1986; Skibo 1992). Analysis of use-wear on
hunter-gatherer pottery can be especially helpful in clarifying if it was used for
cooking tasks over direct heat. An absence of use-wear attributes associated with
processing food over heat, combined with morphological attributes characteristic of
vessels used for storage (such as thick walls), may indicate that such wares were used
for storage.

Pitting and spalling: the result of two different processes
Attributes which are particularly helpful in determining the nature of vessel use
include marks on vessel wall from use over heat, such as small holes created by the
expansion of water in the vessel body when heated (spalls), as well as carbonized food
and fuel deposits on vessel walls (soot marks). Recording the presence and distribution
of spalling on sherd surfaces can provide information on use over a direct heat source.
Hally hypothesizes that pitting consists of cone-shaped holes which can appear on
vessel walls for a variety of reasons related to vessel manufacture: rapid loss of water
during firing, fire cracking, and lime spalling (CaCO3). Pits can also result from use:
thermal shock (from rapid heating and cooling of a vessel), chemical corrosion from
alkaline and acidic solutions used to process seeds and maize, and physical abrasion
resulting from pounding, stirring, etc. Pitting is usually attributed to use when
distributions of pits between vessels are too similar to one another to be explained by
manufacturing processes alone (Hally 1983). Pitting as the result of use has also been

113
distinguished from that resulting from manufacturing by noting its location
exclusively on vessel interiors. Whatever its cause, pitting does not commonly occur
on the exteriors of vessels in southeastern assemblages analyzed by Hally. The pitting
Hally found occurs on vessels exclusive of sooting, which led him to conclude that
pitting is the result of abrasion and not thermal factors (Hally 1983). Ethnographic
observations made by Skibo (1992) indicate that pitting is caused by loss of temper
particles due to abrasion. Skibo noted that pitting does occur on vessel exteriorsâ
especially basesâwhen full pots are placed on sand or other abrasive surfaces and
temper particles are dislodged in the process (Skibo 1992). Thus, pitting appears to be
the result of mechanical abrasion, and can occur on any vessel which is subject to
stirring, washing, or other abrasive processes.
In contrast to pitting, Skiboâs ethnographic observations of Kalinga wares
indicate thermal spalls are found almost exclusively on vessel interiors. Thermal spalls
are circular in shape, and commonly range from 1-3 mm in diameter (Skibo 1992).
They are the result of water vaporizing within the ceramic body and steam pushing off
a portion of the interior surface. Spalling is most common in vessels used to cook
foods over low heat using little water. Any remaining water is lost in this simmering
process. Spalling is most commonly found on the middle portion of the vessel body. It
is less frequent on the upper and lower portions of the vessel body, probably because
they are at higher angles to the heat source and thus deflect more heat than the middle
portion of the vessel. Ethnographic work indicates that pitting and spalling can
coincide on the upper interior portion of a vessel. In contrast, there is little to no
spalling when pots are filled with water for boiling (Skibo 1992). Thus, making
observations on the frequency of spalling on sherds is helpful in assessing hypotheses
concerning vessel use over heat to process starchy foods (Table 5.1).

114
Sooting
Sooting is comprised of carbon and resins deposited on the vessel surface as
the result of fuel combustion. Soot is most commonly identified in archaeological
ceramics as carbon patches on the interior and exterior portions of the vessel wall,
which can occur during firing in an oxidized atmosphere, cooking over direct heat, or
even by burning dwellings or other structures containing pots. Sooting on the exterior
of the vessel is the by-product of wood combustion. The outer layer of exterior soot
can be removed by wiping or rubbing, while another inner layerâmost likely
composed of resins and carbonâis more permanent (Skibo 1992). Sooting on vessel
exteriors is most common on the middle portion of the vessel, and thins near the rim
and base (Tables 5.1 and 5.2). On vessels used over direct heat, sooting is completely
absent from the base, as this portion of the vessel has been oxidized from close
proximity to the heat source. The exact positioning of sooting on the vessel exterior
can vary according to the position of the vessel relative to the heating source (Skibo
1992). Interior sooting is often the result of charred food adhering to vessel walls and
thus can indicate whether a vessel was used over heat (Hally 1983, Skibo 1992).
Carbon patterns on the interiors of vessels vary depending on the mode of cooking
used. In cooking foods with little or no water, sooting appears everywhere on the
vessel interior except just below the rim, including a carbon patch on the base (Table
5.1). When food is boiled in plenty of water, interior sooting usually appears in a band
of varying widths (most likely due to the varying water levels in separate cooking
events) across the mid section of the vessel, excluding the rim/neck area and base
(Skibo and Blinman 1999). Scratches can occur from manipulating the contents of
pots and also from washing vessels to remove soot (Skibo 1992). This latter source of
scratching often has a particular unidirectional assembly of numerous fine scratches
(Skibo 1992).
As with studies of vessel construction, use-wear studies can also have
confounding factors. For example, there is no reason to assume that ceramic vessels

115
were used for one type of task in their lifetimes; pots could have been used in
various aspects of food preparation other than boiling, such as soaking foods, or
storing prepared foods (Hally 1986). Pottery can also be used for heating tasks
pertaining to work other than food preparation (e.g., tanning, dyeing, carrying fire, or
burning offerings; Hally 1986). Even when a pot fails and ceases to exist as a tool,
sherds can be used in other food preparation tasks (Sullivan et al. 1991) or even as
tools to create more pots (Varela et al. 2002). All of these activities have the potential
to leave use-wear traces on the vessel. Pottery exists in high enough frequencies on
UTCP sites that it seems likely that its primary useful form was vessels, not sherds.
Other studies indicate that sherds used as tools in food processing are typically found
in particular contexts, such as sherds used to line roasting pits. Sherds used as potterâs
tools appear to have very distinct patterns of use-wear which cannot be readily
attributed to other uses.

Performance expectations for UTCP pottery
Vessel performance characteristics are affected by trade-offs between function,
materials available, and other constraints (such as time or scheduling conflicts). Thus,
when assessing performance properties of pots, we must keep in mind that
performance attributes are subject to the above constraints. Ideally, we would expect
particular combinations of performance and use-wear attributes to be present in the
assemblages in high frequencies if a given hypothesis is true. If UTCP hunter-gatherer
pots were used primarily as tools for food processing involving direct contact with a
heat source, then we would expect them to be created in ways which would enhance
heating tasks and food processing. Vessels used in direct heating tasks are expected to
be utilitarian wares constructed in such a way that they allow easy access to contents
and effectively conduct heat. Thus, vessels used over direct heat should be
undecorated and have orifices which are wide enough to allow a hand to pass through
to access the contents, and walls should be uniformly thin (Table 5.3). There should be

116
a low frequency of porosity-limiting surface treatments on exterior walls, and high
frequencies of spalling and sooting on vessel walls. If these vessels were used
primarily as tools to store food, then vessels should be unadorned utilitarian wares
with some means of limiting access to their contents, and be resistant to mechanical
shock (Table 5.3). Storage vessels should have narrow orifices, thick walls, high
frequencies of porosity-limiting surface treatments, and low frequencies of spalling
and sooting on vessel walls. In contrast, vessels used for serving or other prestigeenhancing functions would be expected to have wide orifices for easy access to
contents, and formation techniques which are time consuming to create, such as
uniformly thin walls, and a high frequency of decorative surface treatments (Table
5.3).

Methods: Units of Analysis and Measurement
Assemblages as Units of Analysis
When archaeologists characterize pottery assemblages, they often think in
terms of vessels, but collect data from sherds. Certainly the object of interest is
vessels, as these are the tools prehistoric people used. In comparison, sherds are the
result of depositional factors. Yet focusing on sherds is understandable, considering
that whole vessels are fairly rare in the archaeological record (this is very true in the
case of the UTCP). Whole vessels often come from particular depositional contexts,
such as burials. Such contexts are not representative of the whole inventory of pottery
in a given culture (Feathers 1990). Focusing on the vessel as the unit of analysis may
be appropriate given certain research questions pertaining to reconstruction of cultural
practices, or estimating the nature of site occupations (e.g., Longacre 1985; Shapiro
1984). Methods other than refitting, such as constructing vessel lots or estimating the
minimum number of vessels have been used (e.g., Chase 1985; Orton 1993).
Sometimes sherds can be fitted together to form complete or nearly complete vessels,
but refitting is time consuming and in many cases on the UTCP leads to little

117
additional information on how vessels were made and used (see Hood 1998 for an
exception). The generally highly fragmented nature of the ceramic collections from
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), Honeycomb (41LB4), and Little Bethlehem (41AU38) led
me to conclude that refitting would provide little additional information about vessel
manufacture or use.
Since the research focus in this study is on the relationship between the
function and use of pottery by hunter-gatherer groups and how these groups use the
landscape, the interest lies in the frequencies of attributes related to functional design
and use-wear of pottery. Thus, the primary interest is not how many pots are in a given
assemblage, but the proportion of various attributes between assemblages. Given the
research goal, it is not only impractical but unnecessary to convert sherds into vessels
for purposes of analysis. Instead, the assemblage can be used as the unit of analysis
(Orton 1993).

Sherds as Units of Measurement
While it may not be practical or necessary to use vessels as the unit of analysis,
using the assemblage as the unit of analysis can be problematic when working with
sherds. All sherds are not equal. Some are bigger than others, and therefore may carry
more information. For instance, in assemblages where decoration does not cover the
entire vessel (as is often the case in UTCP assemblages) larger sherds may be more
likely to have decoration than smaller sherds. Particular types of vessels (e.g., thinwalled pots; cooking pots; pots with sandy pastes) may break more easily into smaller
pieces than other kinds of pots, leading one to believe that there were more pots of
whatever sort (e.g., thin-walled, etc.) relative to other types (e.g., thick-walled) than
there actually are. Rocek (2002) has demonstrated that focusing on larger sherds to the
exclusion of smaller ones can introduce bias into summary statistics of sherd
thickness. If certain surface treatment and/or use-wear attributes are affected by sherd
size, and assemblages are being compared, then it must be determined if the sherd

118
sizes between assemblages are comparable. Surface treatment and use-wear
attributes are most likely to be affected by sherd size in this study, because these
attributes do not always cover the entire surface of the vessel. It is possible that
smaller sherd sizes could affect the distribution of surface treatment and use-wear
attributes; smaller sherds may have less information, as larger sherds have greater
surface area than smaller ones.
In order to determine if sherd sizes were comparable between sites, the
maximum length of each sherd was taken. Other studies have compared sherd size
between assemblages using weight (e.g., Pierce 1999) but it was not practical to do in
this case, as some sherds had been refitted and joined together by previous analysts
prior to the curation of the assemblages. Potential biases in this study were addressed
by measuring the longest axis of the sherds and using measurements in conjunction
with sherd counts to compare sherds within and between assemblages. All sherds
originally collected were included in the analyses described in this chapter, except for
the block assemblage from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66). In the interests of time, a 20%
random sample was analyzed from each lot from Mitchell Ridge for a total of 1244
sherds. The Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblages contain
sherds refitted and glued by previous analysts. To avoid comparing sherds with larger
vessel sections, measurements and observations were made on individual sherds in the
refitted vessel section, rather than treating the entire vessel section as a single sherd.
Since it was not possible from a curation perspective to take apart joined sherds, I
determined sherd size by measuring the maximum lengths of the sherds. Using
calipers, it was possible to treat each sherd in a group of joined sherds as a separate
sherd. Average maximum sherd lengths are reported in Table 5.4. A comparison of
these means using single factor ANOVA where F=128.09 > the critical value for F
2.99 (p>.55) indicates that sherd size was not comparable between assemblages.
Given this, the question of whether or not sherd size affects the amount of
surface treatment and use-wear attributes in a given assemblage becomes more

119
important. Of the nine possible classes of surface treatments, seven were present in
the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblages, and four were
present in the Little Bethlehem (41AU38) assemblage (Table 5.4). Therefore, in terms
of types of surface treatments Little Bethlehem is not as rich of an assemblage as
Mitchell Ridge and Honeycomb. It is possible that both sherd size and sample size are
affecting the richness of the Little Bethlehem assemblage, yet all three classes of usewear attributes are represented in all three assemblages. Clearly not all attributes are
being affected by sherd size. It remains possible that some surface treatments are
simply not present in inland assemblages such as Little Bethlehem (41AU38).
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) sherds have the highest amounts of striations, sooting, and
spalling than the other two assemblages, which may be expected since Mitchell Ridge
has the largest average sherd size. Yet Little Bethlehem (41AU38) has a higher
frequency of spalling than the Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblage, even though Little
Bethlehem has smaller and fewer sherds than Honeycomb. Although sherd size is not
statistically comparable between assemblages, the assemblage with the smallest sherd
size does not have the lowest frequency of all use-wear attributes, which is unexpected
if sherd size is completely affecting the presence and frequency of attributes on sherd
surfaces.

Methods: Measuring vessel construction and use attributes
Vessel thickness
The thickness of each sherd was measured using digital calipers. Thickness
was reported as one measurement; one measurement was taken at the approximate
center of the sherd, another was taken at an edge. If the second thickness measurement
varied more than 1 millimeter from the first, thickness was qualitatively indicated as
âvariableâ in a separate column on a spreadsheet.

120
Vessel diameter and curvature
In order to determine vessel size, orifice diameter was measured on rim sherds
large enough to obtain a reasonable estimate, using a standard template. Measuring the
curvature of body sherds can provide information on the size and shape of the vessel,
even if the location of this measurement on the vessel is not known. Measuring
curvature on body sherds can be challenging because it is sometimes difficult to orient
a body sherd to its proper position on a vessel. Curvature of sherds can be measured
using various mathematical descriptions of vessel geometry (Feathers 1990; Smith
1983). Accurately inferring the curvature of handmade vessels from sherds can be
problematic as most calculations of vessel curvature are based on geometric
symmetry, and many handmade pots have geometric irregularities. Furthermore,
although measuring curvature allows calculation of vessel diameter at some point on
the vessel, it does not necessarily produce a true maximum diameter of the vessel. In
this study, vessel horizontal curvature was estimated by measuring body sherds using
a specially designed micrometer which measures both chord length and length of
curve (Feathers 1990). This method was chosen because its error has been well
estimated in previous studies (Feathers 1985, 1990). Previous studies indicated that
calculations of vessel diameter were most accurate using sherds with chord lengths of
40 mm or greater (Feathers 1990, pages 380-381). In this study measurements of
horizontal curvature were taken on all sherds with a maximum chord length of 50 mm
or greater, provided the sherd was not a base. Vessel diameter was calculated from
these measurements using the equation:
R=

(c / 2)2
2h + h / 2

,

where R is the radius of the circle, c is the length of the chord, and h is the height of
the chord (Figure 5.1).
Vertical curvature was not taken because sherds were very small on their
vertical axes. Previous work with other collections containing small sherds suggests

121
that vertical curvature measurements have high degrees of inaccuracy, most likely
associated with small chord length (Feathers 1990). Body sherds were oriented prior to
measurement of horizontal curvature by observing the orientation of vessel coils.
There were limitations to this method of measuring body sherds. Not all could be
properly oriented as some were too small to observe coils or did not have significant
curvature. Nonetheless, numeric descriptions such as the ones obtained help give a
sense of the vessel sizes represented in the assemblages.

Vessel shape
Vessel shape (e.g., rounded versus angular) was estimated qualitatively using
two steps. First, sherds were classified by body part: rim neck, shoulder, body, and
base (after Rice 1987). Then, their shapes were characterized using a combination of
Riceâs guidelines and known vessel morphology types in the UTCP. Vessel shapes
were characterized according to categories described in by Rice (1987:216). These
categories are based on vessel proportions (ratio of height to body diameter).
Categories were modified using terminology used to describe vessel forms common
on the UTCP. According to Rice, a bowl form has a height between one third of the
maximum vessel diameter and equal to the diameter, and may have a restricted or
unrestricted orifice, but no necks. A jar is a vessel with a neck and restricted orifice
with a height greater than its maximum diameter (Rice 1987). Whole vessels are rare
on the UTCP, but the few which have been recovered are often described as âjarsâ,
probably because their height is greater than their diameter. Yet they often do not have
restricted orifices. In this study, any vessel with a height greater than its diameter is
referred to as a jar. UTCP jars with relatively restricted orifices or a collar are
described as âglobular jarsâ. Jars with unrestricted orifices and no collars are called
âconcial jarsâ. Bowls are identified using the definition described by Rice (1987).

122
Non-plastic inclusions
The types of non-plastic inclusions (e.g., sand, grog, bone, shell, or other
materials) in each sherd were observed on a freshly broken cross section under 10X
magnification using a binocular dissecting microscope. The quantity of inclusions was
expressed as a categorical frequency (e.g., 0-25%, >25-<50%, >50-<75%, >75>100%, 100%). Size was estimated using a visual version of the Wentworth Scale.
Frequency of inclusions was estimated using a visual scale after Courty et al. 1989.

Surface treatments
Surface treatments which have been previously recognized in UTCP pottery
assemblages include: slipping, burnishing, combing, incising, stamping, cordmarking,
punctuation, as well as scraped and wiped surfaces. All sherds were inspected
macroscopically for evidence of these types of surface treatments. Tar (resin) was
occasionally identified using a binocular dissecting microscope with 10X
magnification, as it was sometimes present in very small quantities, probably due to
post-depositional weathering (Figure 5.1). Surface treatments aside from tar were
identified using Owen Ryeâs book Pottery Technology: Principles and Reconstruction
(1976) which contains photographs and illustrations for each type of surface treatment.
Identifications were also made based on previous experience with UTCP ceramic
assemblages. Slipping is achieved by spreading a mixture of fine clay suspended in
water on a clay surface before firing, producing a non vitreous coating (Rice 1987). In
UTCP assemblages it usually appears as a red coating on the exterior of the vessel
(Figure 5.2). This type of slip is commonly referred to as âred filmâ in the UTCP
literature (Aten 1983). Burnishing is a luster producing surface treatment achieved by
rubbing a hard, smooth implement on a leather-hard vessel and re-aligning clay
particles, packing them more closely together (Rice 1987). This re-alignment of clay
particles can reduce porosity of a pot.

123
Due to its ability to produce great luster, burnishing may not be solely for
limiting porosity of a vessel, but also for decoration. The amount of burnishing can
vary between vessels. Thus, vessels with detectable but low frequencies of burnishing
may not have originally been intended to have low porosity. Combing is achieved by
dragging a serrated or multi-pronged tool across a clay surface while it is still soft or
leather hard (Rice 1987; Rye 1981; Figure 5.3). Incisingâin which a pointed tool is
used to cut lines on leather hard or soft clay surfacesâis one of the most common
surface treatments in UTCP ceramic assemblages (Rice 1987; Rye 1981). Incising is
usually confined to a small area just below the rim on UTCP vessels (Figure 5.2).
Stamping, cordmarking, and punctation are all particular methods of
impressing plastic or leather hard clay surfaces (Rye 1981). These three methods of
impression are common in ceramic assemblages in the American Southeast, and are
sometimes reported in UTCP assemblages. Stamping is a surface treatment produced
by pressing an implement to a soft clay surface to create an impression (Figure 5.4).
Cordmarking is a kind of stamping achieved by pressing a cord-wrapped paddle to a
soft clay surface (Rye 1981). Punctation is a surface treatment produced by pressing
an implement on a soft clay surface to form a depression (Rice 1987; Figure 5.2).
Scraping (sometimes referred to as scoring) is a secondary manufacturing
characteristic. In other UTCP assemblages, scraping was apparently sometimes
performed using the edge of a bivalve (Ellis 1992). Wiped surfaces are created by
passing a hand or soft material (such as grass) over a wet clay surface (Rye 1981). In
both techniques non-plastic inclusions may leave drag marks on the vessel surface.
Such techniques have been used in known cases of pottery manufacture where the
potter was trying to thin the walls of the vessel (Rice 1987).

Use wear characteristics
Identification of spalling and sooting was performed according to descriptive
information provided in Hally (1983) and Skibo (1992). Unlike pitting, spalling has a

124
distinctive conical form when viewed under low magnification (Skibo 1992;
Figure 5.5). Sooting can be confused with blackened areas on vessels resulting from
firing. Here, sooting was recorded when the dark area had a particularly dense and
textured appearance (e.g., Figure 5.6). Identifications were made by looking at the
interior and exterior of each sherd surface at 10X magnification using a binocular
dissecting microscope. The body part each sherd represented was recorded to gain a
sense of the nature of the distribution of use wear over vessel bodies.

Results
Vessel construction attributes
The overall thickness of body, rim and base sherds can reasonably be expected
to vary from one another, and in the case of all three archaeological sites, mean
thickness varies between body parts of the vessel in a predictable fashion. As the most
frequently represented vessel portion, the distribution of thickness measurements of
body sherds follows a similar visual pattern for all three sites (Figure 5.7). Rim
portions of vessels are generally thinner than bases, as indicated in the distributions of
rim and base thickness (Figures 5.8 and 5.9). Given this, it is reasonable to partition
the distribution of wall thickness by vessel body part. When the means of body
thickness measurements between all three sites are compared, they do not differ from
each other statistically, as F=67.478 (p<0.00) (F statistic=863.139). Thickness is also
not highly variable within any given sherd at any of the three sites; although 20.25%
of the sherds at Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) were characterized as varying in thickness
more than 1 mmâclose to a quarter of the assemblage. The other two sites have even
fewer sherds which vary in thickness; Honeycomb having 8.9% and Little Bethlehem
with 13.22%.
Very few rim or body sherds from any of the sites were large enough to
measure orifice diameter or body curvature. The few that were large enough on which
to make accurate measurements came from the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and

125
Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblages ranged between 8 and 41 cm (Figure 5.10).
Diameters of 11 sherds from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) cluster in the 20-28 cm range,
with a mean of 25 cm (Table 5.5). In contrast, the 11 sherds from Honeycomb cluster
between 8 and 19 cm, with a mean of 13.25 cm (Table 5.5). Due to the overall small
size of the sherds in all three assemblages vessel shape could not be reconstructed,
with the exception of two groups of sherds from Honeycomb which join together to
form jar shapes with 12 cm orifice diameters.
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb both have sherds large enough to
calculate the horizontal curvature of a portion of the vessel. The Mitchell Ridge
(41GV66) sample consisted of 54 sherds yielding horizontal body curvatures
clustering between 5 and 19.9 cm (Figure 5.11). The Honeycomb curvatures (n=35)
cluster in the 10-19.9 cm range. There were no sherds in the Little Bethlehem
(41AU38) assemblage large enough to measure. On average, horizontal curvature in
the Mitchell Ridge assemblage is smaller, while the Honeycomb assemblage has
greater curvature, although these differences could be the result of difference in
sample size (Table 5.6).
Identifying the amount and types of non-plastic inclusions using low
magnification can be difficult. Using higher magnification on machined thin sections
enables the analyst to make more accurate estimates, but this is not practical for large
assemblages from economic or conservation standpoints. Thus, any analysis of the
amount and type of non-plastic inclusions in archaeological pottery assemblages must
balance the demands of accuracy with the constraints of practicality. Since this study
includes petrographic analysis, it was decided to compare the estimates obtained from
freshly broken sherds viewed at 10X magnification to thin sections made from the
same sherds to determine how much more accurate the thin section estimates of
inclusions are. Thin sections were made from 19 sherds for petrographic analysis. The
results of the mineralogical analysis of these thin sections are discussed in the next
chapter. The comparison revealed that eight out the 19 (42%) estimates of inclusion

126
frequency from freshly broken sherds viewed at 10X magnification were incorrect.
Of these eight discrepancies, five were the result of underestimating the type and/or
frequency of inclusions in low magnification analysis. The other three were
overestimates of the amount and type of inclusions using low magnification
techniques. In four of the eight samples, discrepancies were the result of
underestimating the amount of bone or grog inclusions from freshly broken cross
sections.
Two main conclusions arise from these comparisons. First, making estimates
of inclusions in UTCP assemblages by looking at sherds in thin section under
magnification higher than 10X provides a more accurate estimate of the amount and
type of inclusions in sherds. Technically the estimates from freshly broken cross
sections of these 19 sherds were a little more than 50% accurate, but this accuracy is
not as high as estimates derived from thin sections. Second, analysis of thin sections is
much more likely to detect inclusions present in low frequencies (between 5 and
20%). In some sherds, bone and grog inclusions are present in very low frequencies
and are mixed with sand. Estimating the amount of inclusion types by looking at
freshly broken cross sections under low magnification is most accurate when
inclusions are present in high frequencies.
Nonetheless, freshly broken cross sections give much information about the
type and frequency of non-plastic inclusions. Sand is by far the most frequent nonplastic inclusion in vessel bodies in each of the three sites (Figure 5.12). Sherds from
Honeycomb and Little Bethlehem also have high frequencies of grog and bone
inclusions, respectively (Figure 5.13). Although grog temper is found in a little over
half the sherds in the assemblage (54.43%), it never appears exclusively from sand but
is rather mixed with sand. This is also the case with the fairly frequent bone inclusions
in Little Bethlehem sherds (Figure 5.14). In contrast to sand, when grog or bone
inclusions occur, they do so at low frequencies (Figures 5.15 and 5.16). In many cases
sherds have fewer than five visible pieces of non-plastics (except for sand) in a cross

127
section. Trace amounts of ferric and calcium carbonate concretions, shell and
hematite are commonly present.
The fact that a little over half of the Honeycomb assemblage contains grog
temper is of special consideration when evaluating the idea that UTCP vessels may
have been designed for use over direct heat. The high frequency of thin walls correlate
with grog temper. Variability in wall thickness was recorded as presence/absence data
creating nominal-scale categories. Temper frequency was recorded as ratio-scale
categorical data. Therefore, it was appropriate to use Yuleâs Q statistic to evaluate the
strength of the possible correlation. Q can be calculated from 2x2 tables of nominalscale data. When Q=1 the variables are perfectly correlated (Shennan 1990). In the
Honeycomb assemblage the correlation between grog temper and walls which do not
vary in thickness appears high with Q=0.986. Yet these results can be misleading, as
non-variable wall thickness appears almost evenly distributed between sherds with and
without grog. In other words, the correlation could be a coincidence. There appears to
be no such correlation between grog temper and variable wall thickness in the Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) (Q=0.04) and Little Bethlehem (Q=-0.10) assemblages.
Surface treatments with potential decorative purposes occur in low frequencies
in all assemblages. Honeycomb yielded the most decorated sherdsâ5.4% of the whole
assemblage. The most common decorative surface treatment is incising, which usually
occurs near the rim of the vessel. Other treatments typically occurring in UTCP
assemblages were present in small amounts. These include combed surfaces, surfaces
coated with red film, punctuated, and stamped surfaces (Table 5.7).
Other surface treatments may or may not have served decorative purposes. The
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) sample included 70 sherds with varying amounts of tar on
them; 56 of the Honeycomb sherds also had tar on some portion of their exterior or
interior surfaces (Table 5.7). This surface treatment is common in the central Texas
coastal area and often occurs in thin wavy lines on the exterior or vessels (Ricklis
1996). It is often associated with the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1996). Tar

128
(commonly referred to as asphaltum) is present on interior and exterior portions of
sherds. The distribution of tar on vessel bodies in UTCP assemblages make its
function unclear. Tar could have been used as decoration, as it apparently is in
Rockport-type assemblages on the central Texas coast. Some Rockport vessels are
completely coated with tar on the exterior, and such coverage may indicate a
utilitarian function as wellâeither to limit porosity or to protect vessels from abrasion.
In the cases of Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb, sometimes the surface of a
sherd was entirely covered by tar resin, while in other cases only a few small flecks
were present. Some resin was only detectable when the sherd was viewed using 10X
magnification. Some sherds also exhibited burnishing, a surface treatment which can
be considered decorative, but can also be useful in limiting the porosity of the vessel
walls (Rice 1987). Less than 1% of the sherds in any of the three assemblages
exhibited burnishing. Another surface treatment which did occur in higher frequencies
consisted of striations, mostly present on the interior of the vessel, but sometimes also
on the exterior (Table 5.7). This surface treatment is common in UTCP pottery
assemblages but its potential functions have not been investigated (Ellis 1992; Suhm
and Jelks 1962). Similar marks have been noted in ethnographic studies of pottery
manufacture and are commonly described as âscrapingâ (see photograph in Rice 1987,
page 137; Rye 1981). Scraping is often used to thin walls or remove surface
imperfections (Rice 1987).

Use wear
Skiboâs experimental work indicates that vessels used primarily for simmering
tasks (heating food with little water) have a high frequency of spalling on their
interiors, excluding the lower body and base areas. Sooting is heavy on vessel interiors
and is concentrated on the middle portion of the body and the base. In comparison,
pots used primarily for boiling tasks have no spalling on their interiors. Some sooting
is occasionally present, but not in the thick deposits observed on vessels used for

129
simmering tasks. Scratches were observed to often be the result of wiping soot off
of vessel surfaces. The rim scratches commonly present on vessels used for boiling are
often the result of the abrasion from utensils (Skibo 1992). Use wear signatures for
simmering and boiling vary little on the exterior of pots. Both processes create heavy
deposits of soot on the middle exterior portions of the vessel body, and areas of
scratches caused by washing soot off of the vessel.
Sherd assemblages from all three sites have a small percentage of spalling on
their interiors (Table 5.8). Spalling on interior portions of body sherdsâexpected if
vessels were used for simmering starchy foodsâis particularly low (Table 5.19).
Across all assemblages, sooting on vessel bodies and bases appears low as well. The
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) assemblage has more sooting in general compared to the
other two assemblages, and definitely more sooting on exterior portions of body and
base sherds than on sherd interiors (Tables 5.8 and 5.9). Honeycomb (41LB4) body
sherds also have more exterior sooting than on their interiors (Tables 5.10 and 5.11).
In contrast, the Little Bethlehem (41AU38) assemblage has about an equal amount of
sherds with sooting on their interiors and exteriors (Tables 5.12 and 5.13). Bases
appear in these assemblages in very small numbers, so greater sample sizes may give a
more accurate sense of what proportion of these assemblages were used over direct
heat. Sooting is frequently present on the small sample of bases in the Mitchell Ridge
(41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblages. Based on Skiboâs experimental
work, patches of soot appear on interior portions of bases of vessels used over low or
indirect heat, such as those used to simmer starchy foods like rice (Skibo 1992; Tables
5.1 and 5.2). Based on this information, Mitchell Ridge vessels may have been used to
simmer starchy foods in some cases. More puzzling is the higher percentage of sooting
on the exterior portions of bases in this assemblage. The dark areas on these exterior
bases could have been misidentified as sooted when in fact the dark patches are the
result of fireclouding or residual tar. Perhaps the soot appeared on these bases as the

130
result of using them for heating tasks after they ceased to be part of a vessel.
Sooting on bases could also be a use wear pattern previously unrecognized.
Since scratches are often associated with soot removal, it makes sense that a
low frequency of sooting and a high frequency of scratches could indicate that pots
could have been used over heat. The majority of sherds from all three assemblages
have fairly low frequencies of scratches. Among the individual sherds where scratches
were observed, the density of scratches is relatively low, in most cases less than 25
percent (Tables 5.8-5.13). This generally low frequency of scratches on individual
sherds does not match the observed pattern of dense scratches associated with washing
sooted vessels known to be used over heat (Skibo 1992).

Discussion
The measurements and observations discussed in this chapter (vessel wall
thickness, vessel orifice diameter and horizontal curvature, the nature and frequency of
non-plastic inclusions, surface treatments, and use wear attributes) provide some
information to evaluate the three sets of hypotheses related to cooking, storage, and
prestige functions of pottery. One set of hypotheses asked whether pots were used to
process foods using direct or indirect heating methods. The data presented here
support the idea that UTCP pots may have been used over direct heat, although this
cannot be demonstrated unequivocally. A key aspect of vessel construction of pottery
from all three sites is the uniform thickness of sherds. Moreover, the distributions of
sherd thicknesses are clustered around 3-8 mm, much thinner than the 10 cm walls of
pottery used for indirect heating among hunter-gatherer groups in the American
Northwest, including Alaska (Reid 1990). More geographically closer to the UTCP,
Braun describes Mississippian âthick-walledâ vessels as being between 10-15 mm in
thickness, while the âthin-walledâ vessels used for direct heating tasks range from 612 mm (Braun 1983). UTCP vessels fall well within this thin-walled range.

131
Other morphology data present a less distinct picture of how vessels might
have been used to process foods. The few bases identified in the assemblages are
rounded, supporting the idea that pots were designed to perform well over heat. The
data on vessel orifice diameter are limited; and come from sherds in the Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblages. Generally, most orifices are
wide enough to pass a hand through for easy access to contents, suggesting that
vessels were used for some sort of food processing. It is interesting to note that sherds
from Honeycomb have on average smaller orifices, five in the 8-10 cm range. These
orifice diameters are a little too small to allow a hand easy access to vessel contents,
unless these sherds represent cups or small bowls; such wares have been documented
on other UTCP sites (Hood 1998). Unfortunately there is very little information about
vessel shape from these assemblages. It is clear that horizontal curvature is less flat in
the Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblage than in the Mitchell Ridge assemblage. The
Mitchell Ridge assemblage has comparatively larger orifice diameters and less
curvature than the Honeycomb assemblage. Based on orifice diameter and curvature
measurements, vessels from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) are larger on average than
those from Honeycomb. It is possible that the overall smaller vessel orifice diameter at
Honeycomb simply indicates that pots were smaller and there were fewer individuals
present at the site at a given time than at the significantly larger site of Mitchell Ridge
(41GV66). The difference in the distributions of orifice diameters and body curvature
between Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb may also indicate that these two
sites were for different activities which in turn are reflected in the ceramic
assemblages. It is possible that the overall smaller wares at Honeycomb were used for
storage and the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) wares were used for food processing and/or
serving.
There is significant variation in non-plastic inclusions between sites. Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb have high frequencies of sherds with grog temper
compared to Little Bethlehem. The fact that a little over half of the Honeycomb

132
assemblage contains grog temper is of special consideration when evaluating the
idea that UTCP vessels may have been designed for use over direct heat. The high
frequency of thin walls appears to be correlated with grog temper in the Honeycomb
assemblage. The presence of bone inclusions in relatively high frequencies is not
unexpected at Little Bethlehem, as local researchers consider bone-tempered wares to
be common on the inland portion of the Texas coastal plain. Bone temper is not
common on the coastal margin, but it has been noted on coastal margin sites in small
quantities, as it is in this study. It is not currently known if bone temper has any
properties that would make vessels more useful for heating or any other tasks in
particular.
The correlation of use wear attributes associated with use over direct heat
(sooting, spalling) with thin vessel walls and grog inclusions would bolster an
argument for the design and use of UTCP vessels over direct heat. Yet sooting and
spalling occur in such small frequencies that their presence is negligible. Spalling is
most common to interior portions of body sherds, rather than rims or bases, indicating
that perhaps some pots were used to simmer foods. In the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66)
and Honeycomb assemblages, there is more exterior than interior sooting (27% for
Mitchell Ridge and 11.8% for Honeycomb).
In terms of the food processing hypotheses, the data are mostly based on very
small percentages of the assemblages. The major exception to this is the wall thickness
data, which unequivocally indicates that vessel walls exhibit a thinness which is
uniform within and between sites. Whether this is linked with using vessels to process
foods over direct heat is unclear. Yet anecdotal evidence from attempts to replicate
UTCP pottery suggests that in order to create pottery from the local clays available,
prehistoric potters may have needed to make thin walls of a uniform thickness in order
to create a vessel which would survive firing (Black 1988; Hill 1975). UTCP clays are
smectites, which due to their crystal structure and particle shape and size, absorb and
lose water easily. Thus, pots made from local clays which are not sufficiently dried are

133
more prone to failure during firing. Gertjejansen and Shenkel (1983) note in their
experiments on replicating Tchefuncte-style wares from similar clays in nearby
Louisiana that 8 mm appears to be an optimal wall thickness for these vessels: thick
enough to support walls during the drying stages before firing, and thin enough to
reduce the chances of pots warping, cracking, or spalling during firing. Thinner walls
also dry far more quickly than thicker ones, especially in areas with high humidity
such as the UTCP (Hill 1975). This is an important consideration if UTCP groups
were very mobile, as drying appears to take anywhere from four days to five weeks
depending on the weather (Black 1988; Gertjejansen and Shenkel 1983; Hill 1975).
The longer the drying time the more risk there is of pre-firing failure, as sudden
weather changes affecting humidity and precipitation levels can also destroy leatherhard vessels (Hill 1975). Thus, pottery drying time could have been an important
factor for UTCP potters to control.
Successful firing may also have been an important consideration when creating
vessel sizes and shapes. Rounded vessel shapes appear common in all assemblages
judging from the morphology of the sherds. In fact, there are no sherds which exhibit
an angularity which might suggest angular forms. Pottery replication work indicates
rounded shapes made from local clays appear to fare better on average during firing
than angular shapes (Black 1988). In terms of shape, vessels made from local
Louisiana clays which are 28 cm or less in diameter tend to fire in a very predictable
manner. Vessels over 23 cm high can be difficult to fire (Gertjenjansen and Shenkel
1983). Use of non-plasticsâany non-plasticsâalso appear to reduce failure when
firing wares made from local clays by helping a fine, wet clay dry more thoroughly
before firing (Black 1988).
Nonetheless, the use wear data indicate that at least a small portion of each
assemblage was used over direct heat. Yet this low frequency of use wear signatures
associated with use over direct heat may also indicate that UTCP assemblages were
primarily used to process large-bodied animal resources using indirect heating

134
methods. This hypothesis is somewhat supported, although mostly by negative
evidence. Assemblages from all three sites have low frequencies of porosity-limiting
surface treatments (such as burnishing, slipping, and resin coatings), which would be
expected in vessels used to process foods without bringing them to a boil. Yet none of
the assemblages examined in this study contain sherds which suggest flat bases.
The lack of heating use-wear signatures in these assemblages lends support to
the hypothesis that vessels were mostly used for storage. Low frequencies of sooting
and spalling suggest that overall assemblages may not have been used over direct heat.
If thin walls were necessary for vessels to survive firing, then they may not be an
accurate indicator of whether vessels were designed for storage or not. Yet surface
treatments commonly associated with increasing the liquid storage capacity of vessels
are rare in all three assemblages. Tarred treatments comprise less than 5% of the
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) sample and less than 2% of the Honeycomb sample. There
are no tarred sherds in the Little Bethlehem assemblage. Less than 1% of the sherds in
any of the three assemblages have any burnishing. Vessels from these assemblages do
not appear to have been engineered specifically for storage, at least not wet storage. It
is possible that these pots were used for dry storage. Additional information from
residue analysis may provide another means of evaluating hypotheses concerned with
âfront-loadedâ and âback-loadedâ storage strategies.
Concerning the prestige hypothesis, the low levels of decoration in all
assemblages indicate that a great deal of labor was not invested in decorating the
vessels. The notably thin walls of the majority of vessels could have been used as a
signal to others that the individual maker possesses a high level of skill to make such
wares, or that individuals using these wares are displaying their ability to make or
acquire pottery which is costly because it is time-consuming to make. This argument
might be more convincing if replications of vessels with local clays did not strongly
suggest that vessels without thin walls are highly impractical as they have less chance
of surviving firing. The relatively wide orifice diameters in the limited sample of the

135
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) assemblage support the idea that vessels at this site were
used for preparing and/or serving food for large groups of people. This idea is
supported by the overall large size of the site and the fact that it has four cemeteries,
suggesting that it may have served as a focal point for spiritual life and associated
ceremonies. In order to accept the hypothesis that vessels at any of these sites were
used in prestige tasks, assemblages should have high frequencies of decorative surface
treatments, and none of these assemblages do. It is also possible that post-depositional
alteration of sherds has obscured use wear and surface treatments, and this has
implications for all sets of hypotheses. In this analysis, only four sherds from Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) were identified as being noticeably eroded; 37 sherds from
Honeycomb were identified as such and 5 sherds from Little Bethlehem. It is possible
many more sherds in the assemblages are eroded and it was not recognized at the time
of analysis. It would be useful to look at other UTCP pottery assemblages in a similar
manner to determine if they too have low frequencies of surface treatments. For
examples, previous studies have noted that there is not much exterior sooting on other
UTCP pottery assemblages (Ellis 1992).

Conclusions
Data collected from manufacturing and use wear attributes on three vessel
assemblages from the UTCP do not unequivocally indicate how pottery was used. The
information gained from these three assemblages suggests that at least a small
frequency of vessels were used over direct heat. The low frequencies of interior
spalling and sooting in all three sherd assemblages suggest that either a high frequency
of vessels were not used over direct heat, or may have been used to boil foods over
direct heat rather than simmering. Either possibility supports the idea that UTCP
groups were not processing high amounts of foods over heat with low amounts of
water, such as starchy seeds or cultigens. Particular types of non-plastics were not
necessarily being selected by potters for their individual performance properties.

136
Perhaps these mixtures indicate that the primary purpose of non-plastics was to
make raw clays more workable, and thus any sort of non-plastic would suffice. Or
perhaps a mixture of inclusions indicates no particular function of a vessel (e.g.,
heating) but rather that pots were generally multipurpose tools used in a variety of
tasks. While vessel wall thickness (especially in the case of Honeycomb) suggests that
vessels were engineered for use over heat, other aspects of the manufacturing process
confound this interpretation. Thin walls may have been necessary to work with the
unforgiving local clays in the UTCP region.
Data on surface treatments associated with storage of liquids or use over heat is
low as well. It is not clear if some surface treatments, especially those associated with
limiting vessel porosity were subject to post-depositional erosion. Vessels may not
intended for particular tasks of heating or storage, but instead functioned in both
capacities. Organic residue data provide more information on front and back loaded
(âwetâ and âdryâ) storage and thus provide some information on how frequently these
pottery assemblages were used for purposes other than heating.
The roles of these vessels in prestige activities are difficult to assess as sherds
are too small to determine vessel morphology and size. Small amounts of decoration
on a small fraction of each vessel assemblage suggest that some vessels may have
been used in contexts where display or communication of information was important.
Although the data pertaining to vessel construction and use do not fully
support or refute any of the three sets of hypotheses, they do highlight some noticeable
differences in assemblages between sites. Most notably, the ceramic assemblages from
the coastal margin sites of Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4) have
higher amounts of grog temper, suggesting that vessels were constructed to perform
well over heat. Honeycomb in particular has a high correlation between thin vessel
walls and grog temper, and the Mitchell Ridge assemblage has vessel bases with a
relatively high amount of sooting on their interiors, which correlates with Skiboâs
experimental findings on vessels used to simmer starchy foods.

CHAPTER 6: MOVEMENT, TRADE, AND VESSEL MANUFACTURE:
THE MINERALOGICAL DATA
Introduction: Implications of Sourcing for Hypotheses
Traditionally, pottery manufacture and use are not associated with huntergatherer societies with high degrees of residential mobility. Archaeologists have
frequently operated on the assumption that the physical properties of pottery make it
too bulky for frequent transport. Furthermore, pottery manufacture requires people to
stay in one place, which may inhibit their ability to access food resources in other
locations. The transport costs of clay may be high or groups frequently on the move
(Eerkens 2002). Yet the presence of pottery has been documented among mobile
hunter-gatherers (Eerkens 2002). Instead of seeing pottery as an indicator of sedentism
among hunter-gatherer societies, it can be used to investigate group mobility and
trade, as is commonly done with food-producing and/or groups with high degrees of
sedentism.
Sourcing pottery addresses questions of how pots have moved across the
landscape, either through movement of groups of people, and/or trade. In turn, trade
can involve the movement of individuals, or goods in a âdown-the-lineâ fashion.
Geologic sourcing has been used to better understand the degree of mobility of
populations and the nature of trade between groups (e.g., Bishop 1980; Eerkens et al
2002; Ferring and Perttula 1989; Glascock 2002). In turn, understanding group
mobility and trade has implications for hypotheses concerning food processing, food
storage, and self-aggrandizing behavior in small-scale societies. In particular, the
degree of group mobility has implications for what kinds of resources are being taken
and how they are processed. If the geologic sources of pots are varied, then we might
expect that groups were pursuing predominately large-bodied food resources with
large home ranges. Such large ranges would require a high degree of group mobility.
This idea can be tested using sourcing data, and cross-checked using
morphological/use-wear and organic residue data. The degree of group mobility has
implications for storage strategies in hunter-gatherer societies as well. Pots with a

157
variety of geologic sources may indicate a high frequency of mobility, which may
indicate that groups are moving rather than relying on storage to fill spatial and/or
temporal gaps in resources.
Sourcing data can also be used to address models of the role of ceramic vessels
in prestige economies. Vessels from non-local sources may have functioned as
prestige items, indicating to others that their owners were able to obtain rare, exotic
items. Exotic goods may also indicate political, economic, or social connections. Such
connections may indicate contact with elites, and/or may have been used to enhance
individual or group social/political standing in local societies. While trade cannot
always be distinguished from group movement, it is reasonable to expect that trade
might be distinguished from mobility by the frequency of pots from non-local
geologic sources and other data such as faunal seasonality. Determining how vessels
were distributed across the landscape provides data which can be used to help test
hypotheses of vessel function and use in hunter-gatherer societies. On a regional level,
sourcing studies can contribute to our understanding of the nature of mobility and
trade, as well as ceramic vessel function and use on the upper Texas coastal plain.

Expectations for Mobility and Trade: Distribution of Food Resources
The archaeological record of the upper Texas coastal plain contains numerous
examples of hunter-gatherer pottery, but the degree of group mobility in this region is
unknown. We can develop expectations for how mobile UTCP groups were by relying
on theoretical relationships between the type and distribution of food resources on the
landscape, and mobility and storage. This theoretical work continues to draw upon
ethnological and archaeological research on relationships between resource use,
mobility, and storage. Similar theoretical relationships are being developed between
the distribution of resources and trade between groups, and they are summarized here.
The nature and distribution of food resources on the UTCP is then discussed, followed
by general expectations for pottery function and use in this region based on resource
information.

158
Ethnographic research indicates that the degree of group mobility in
hunter-gatherer societies may be linked with the type as well as the distribution of
food resources on the landscape. Both the spatial and temporal distribution of
resources is empirically linked with the degree of group mobility. Groups focusing
primarily on small-bodied and aquatic resources often have smaller foraging ranges. In
contrast, groups maintaining high degrees of mobility often do so given their frequent
pursuit of large-bodied prey (Binford 2001; Stenton 1991). The spatial and temporal
distribution of resources can also affect the degree of group mobility. If food resources
are abundant in a particular area, groups may have no reason to move elsewhere. If
resources are spatially dispersed, then groups may need to be more mobile in order to
pursue them. Likewise, in cases where different resources are temporally variable,
groups may need to move in order to take advantage of resources as they become
available.
The degree and type of mobility as well as the interplay between prehistoric
settlement and subsistence on the UTCP are not completely understood. Excavations
of UTCP sites have yielded a variety of large and small-bodied fauna. The presence of
large-bodied fauna with large home ranges, such as deer and bison, could indicate that
upper Texas coast hunter-gatherers maintained residential mobility in order to
frequently pursue such prey. Or perhaps a few of these animals occasionally came
near enough to be taken without the need for changing residence. Based on
environmental reconstructions and the seasonal availability of key resources, the
inhabitants of this region appear to have lived in a highly productive environment rich
in wild foods available throughout the annual cycle beginning about 2000 B.P. (Story
1990). Groups may or may not have moved between coastal and interior portions of
the coastal plain. Perhaps some groups remained on the interior of the coastal plain
throughout the annual cycle (Story 1990). Or there could have been distinct groups in
both the coastal margin and interior who engaged in cooperative resource procurement
on the border of each othersâ territories (Ricklis 1996). Certainly physical geography
was unlikely to constrain group foraging ranges, as the Gulf Coastal Plain is

159
characterized by a uniformly low elevation. And while much of the area is
traversed by waterways and/or subject to seasonal flooding, this sort of environment is
navigable by watercraft, which may have facilitated group movement between
resource patches (Moore 1995). More information on UTCP subsistence and mobility
will help determine the roles ceramic vessels had in food processing in this huntergatherer society. Despite the plentiful food resources on the coastal margin, it is
plausible that periodic changes in local resource abundance may have necessitated
groups moving to other resources, and/or trading with adjacent groups for food. This
may also have been the case for inland coastal plain groups, who most likely
experienced resource abundance in the fall, but may have had lean times in other
seasons. Coastal margin groups may have had smaller foraging ranges, and focused
more on small-bodied and aquatic resources, while interior groups maintained greater
mobility in the process of pursuing large-bodied prey.
There is also a theoretical relationship between the distribution of food
resources and degree of food storage. Anthropologists have identified various storage
strategies in ethnographic research and theoretical work. Many hunter-gatherer
societies store food to some degree during the annual cycle (Binford 1980). Food
storage allows people to average surpluses in order to buffer against shortages the
temporal distribution of resources during the annual cycle (Goland 1991; Weissner
1982). Yet in order for a food storage strategy to be useful, groups must be able to
consistently generate a sufficient surplus to cover their shortages (Cashdan 1992;
Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978; Goland 1991). Groups who experience predictable
spatial food shortages may instead solve the problem by moving frequently and
maintaining social networks to facilitate this movement (Weissner 1982). Storage may
require groups to be more sedentary. This idea is discussed later.
Recent archaeological research has focused on the idea that ceramic vessels
were used as tools to accrue social and political prestige in foraging societies (e.g.,
Hayden 1995; Rice 1996). While accruing material possessions is often at odds with

160
values (such as individual autonomy and movement) in socially egalitarian huntergatherer societies, there are examples of craft traditions in foraging societies often
described as socially egalitarian (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Weissner 1982).
Hayden has argued that ceramic vessels have the potential to be ideal prestige items,
as they can be made to be aesthetically pleasing and rare or exotic materials can be
used in their construction (Hayden 1995). Recent ethnographic research suggests that
in some cases, pottery production can be converted into other kinds of fitnessenhancing benefits (such as obtaining well-to-do husbands; Bliege Bird and Smith
2005). Ceramic vessels may be implicated with prestige behavior in another manner.
The actual value of ceramic vessels can also derive from the items within that may be
of social or economic significance, such as exotic foods and/or intoxicants (Arthur
2002; Hoopes and Barnett 1995). Ethnohistoric information and anthropological
theory indicate that the processing, display, and consumption of such foods are of
social and political value (Hayden 1995). The creation, display, and sharing of exotic
foods can be used in a competitive manner to signal political strength, gain power, or
create/strengthen political alliances (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Hayden 1990).
Vessels of non-local provenance and/or exotic foods can be obtained through trade.
Therefore, another means assessing the hypothesis of ceramic vessels functioning in
prestige contexts.
At first glance, the pottery of the UTCP does not appear to be costly either in
terms of raw materials or labor. Clays in this area are plentiful and in a sense premixed with non-plastics and ready to use for vessel manufacture (Ellis 1992). As
ubiquitous as they are, these clays can hardly be described as rare and difficult to
procure. Most researchers have reasonably assumed that these vessels are made from
local materials widely available throughout the area, but the geologic provenance of
these wares has not been investigated. Whether or not UTCP vessels contained rare or
costly foods useful in prestige display contexts is not clear. Logically, pots may have
contained cultigens such as maize, possibly traded from the Caddo. Ceramic vessels
are implicated in these proposed trade patterns in various ways. The wares themselves

161
may not have been attractive to the Caddo, as they had their own pottery tradition,
but perhaps UTCP or Caddo wares containing trade foods or other goods were passed
between cultural areas. The greater decorative variety of Caddo wares relative to
UTCP wares may also have been desirable to UTCP groups as items to indicate status,
as in the ability to maintain social and/or trade ties with outside groups or in the
possession of exotic pottery. Thus, there are many reasons why both inland and coastal
groups on the UTCP might have traded pottery and its contents with Caddo groups.
Even if food shortages did not occur in a predictable fashion, interior and coastal
groups may have maintained trade relations with the Caddo for a variety of reasons: to
exchange foodstuffs to gain greater nutritional variety (such as bison or fish for maize,
e.g., Spielmann 1986), or to maintain social ties to buffer against lean times and/or for
marriage alliances. UTCP groups may have also traded with the Caddo or groups to
the west for lithic materials, as the coastal plain has very few raw material sources.
In summarizing expectations for the provenance of UTCP ceramic vessels, we
would expect that if groups were highly mobile, high frequencies of pottery in UTCP
assemblages would have mineral inclusions from non-local sources. As discussed
above, the degree of group mobility depends on how mobile food resources are, and
how much they are clustered in time and space. Based on environmental information,
we would expect UTCP hunter-gatherers to have some degree of seasonal mobility as
a means of responding to somewhat predictable spatial and temporal variability in
food resources. Given the many small-bodied resources (e.g., shellfish) present in the
region which were most likely plentiful in many areas of the region, UTCP huntergatherers are expected to have had little incentive to store foods. This might not be the
case if population density increased to the point where populations outstripped food
resources, which they may have experienced as spatial and temporal gaps in food
availability. If groups are moving frequently around the landscape, and/or storing little
food, we would expect pottery to be from non-local geologic sources. The undecorated
wares common in many ceramic assemblages in the region underscore the expectation
that pots are not prestige items, and therefore few if any are expected to be from non-

162
local geologic sources. While analysis of morphological and use-wear
characteristics of UTCP vessels provides some information about group resource use,
storage, and prestige behavior, sourcing data can be used in conjunction with this
information to assess hypotheses concerning the nature of food processing, storage,
and prestige behavior.

Sourcing Methods
Archaeologists have used various sourcing methods to address archaeological
questions of movement and trade for many decades. Chemical characterization
methods have been applied to archaeological questions since the mid-nineteenth
century, although mineralogical analyses of ceramic pastes were more common in the
early twentieth century (Neff et al. 1992; Shepard 1936). During the past few decades,
chemical characterization methods have become more commonly used in
archaeological sourcing studies, while the frequency of mineralogical studies has
decreased (e.g., Arnold et al. 1991; Bishop 1980, Glascock 2002; Neff et al. 1992;
Sayre 1957). Recently, combinations of chemical characterization and mineral
analysis methods have been used to address questions of group movement and/or trade
(e.g., Montana et al. 2003; Perttula et al. 2001; Stoltman et al. 1992).
Chemical or elemental sourcing methods commonly used in the past few
decades include neutron activation analysis (NAA), various inductively coupled
plasma techniques (ICP), x-ray florescence (XRF) and Particle induced x-ray emission
(PIXE). Elemental analyses of ceramic materials typically focus on anions commonly
associated with ceramic materials, such as silicates, carbonates, sulfates and
hydroxides, halides, oxides, and sulfides (Hancock 2000). Two of the most commonly
used methods are NAA and ICP, which basically measure the kind and abundance of
elements in a given sample. In NAA the sample is disaggregated (ground up),
dissolved, and bombarded with neutrons and them measuring the gamma emission.
ICP methods involve heating the sample in a hot gas (plasma), which produces excited
atoms whose light wavelengths are measured. Chemical analyses are often performed

163
quickly by a laboratory specializing in the work, and the methods can be used with
relatively small amount of ceramic material.
Determining geological provenance of pottery using mineralogical data
continues to be done decades after Anna Shepardâs ground-breaking work (Shepard
1936) on sourcing pottery pastes using their mineral inclusions (e.g., Dickinson 1998;
OâMalley 1981; Porter and Szuter 1978; Shepard 1965; Stoltman 1989, 2001).
Petrography is commonly used in geology to describe and classify rocks in thin
section in order to study their origin, occurrence, structure, and history. While the
method does require specialized knowledge and training on the part of the operator, it
not only allows researchers to provide information about the geologic source of a
sherd, but also about the nature of its manufacture; such as the size and orientation of
particles, as well as pores or voids in the ceramic body.
Generally it is assumed that ceramics with different chemical or mineralogical
constituents are from different geologic sources. This idea has been more specifically
stated in the Provenance Postulate, which Neff suggests can apply to both chemical
and mineralogical sourcing methods: âSourcing is possible as long as there exists
some qualitative chemical or mineralogical difference between natural sources that
exceeds the qualitative or quantitative variation within each source.â (Neff 2000:107108). Despite the elegance of the idea, linking ceramic pastes with specific source
locations can be problematic. Often during the process of ceramic manufacture,
materials are added or deleted from ceramic pastes in the course of levigation
(removal of coarse particles) of raw clays or addition of non-plastic materials. These
actions can alter the chemical and mineralogical composition of pots (Arnold et al.
1991; Blackman 1992). Pottery can also absorb residues during use and/or burial
which in turn can add to its chemical signal (Neff 2000; Stoltman 2001). Thus, when
bulk ceramic samples are analyzed using chemical sourcing methods, it is not always
clear whether the information obtained pertains to paste, temper source, or the addition
or leaching of materials during use or burial. These conditions can affect the validity
of results when the chemical composition ceramics is used to determine geological

164
location on the landscape (Neff 2000). It can also be difficult to reliably link pots
to a particular location if the variability in elemental concentrations in temper is high
and similar to those of the clay (Neff 2000). Thus, it cannot be assumed chemical
sourcing methods identify raw material sources. Rather, these methods can be used to
show there is little or no difference between the ceramic sample and samples of
potential raw materials. Differences in composition cannot automatically be
interpreted to indicate differences in source material.
Researchers have pointed out that in order to accurately determine geologic
provenance of ceramic vessels, other non-elemental methods may be useful (Neff
2000). Such methods can range from macroscopic (design, color) to microscopic
(Rands and Weimer 1992). Unlike chemical constituent analyses, mineralogical
analysis can enable the analyst to distinguish between temper and clay composition
(Stoltman 2001). When coupled with elemental methods, mineralogical analysis may
indicate differences in ceramic paste composition not revealed in chemical methods
(Stoltman et al. 1992). In addition, mineralogical analysis of petrographic thin sections
can provide information on manufacturing attributes, such as the presence of glazes
and slips (Ferring and Perttula 1987). Furthermore, petrographic thin sections can be
inspected to gain a sense of types and frequencies of temper and pores in a ceramic
body.
Sourcing in continental basins such as the upper Texas coastal plain can be
complicated by geologic sources and relief which are homogenous over large areas of
land. Large river systems can mix sediments and effectively homogenize sources. In
such cases, the variability of mineral constituents of sediments between source areas
may actually not exceed that within a single source area. Very little sourcing research
has been done on UTCP pottery (see Skokan 1995, 1996 for studies in the Brazos
drainage). Some have been conducted in the Caddoan cultural area in what is now
Southeastern Oklahoma/Southwestern Arkansas/East Texas (Ferring and Perttula
1987; Perttula 2002). In order to test the hypotheses discussed at the beginning of the
chapter, sourcing data were necessary. Information on the frequency and type of

165
inclusions and pores in the ceramic paste would also be useful in evaluating the
hypotheses. In order to avoid some of the possible problems with distinguishing
between clay and temper sources, as well as to learn more about the frequency and
types of aplastic inclusions and pores of the ceramics in this region, it was decided to
focus initial efforts on a mineralogical analysis using petrographic methods. The data
generated in this study may provide a starting point for future studies in the UTCP
region and adjacent cultural areas.

Local and exotic ceramic types
Our current knowledge of the provenance of UTCP pottery is limited, although
ceramics are commonly assumed to be made from local clays on the gulf coastal plain.
Occasionally pottery styles resembling those from the Caddo area and the Lower
Mississippi Valley (LMV) appear in UTCP assemblages (Moore 1995; Perttula 2002;
Ricklis 1994). UTCP pottery is distinctively plain in comparison to Caddoan and
LMV wares. UTCP vessels are generally thin-walled with little decoration. What
embellishment does occur is usually on the lip and/or rim of the vessel (see Aten 1983;
Suhm and Jelks 1962 and Chapter 5 of this study for examples). In contrast, Caddoan
wares commonly exhibit many decorative styles which have been classified in a
comparatively complex type-variety system (Phillips et al. 1951; Suhm and Jelks
1962). Not only do Caddoan pots have a variety of decorative styles much greater than
among UTCP wares, but Caddoan wares appear to have a greater variety of shapes
than UTCP vessels. LMV wares are also distinctive in their amount and variety of
decoration compared to UTCP wares. Most other LMV pottery types of the Late
Prehistoric Period have distinctive design treatments quite different from UTCP wares.
Many Late Prehistoric/Mississippian LMV wares are tempered with shell, a rare
inclusion in UTCP wares.
However, there are some similarities between a few LMV and UTCP pottery
types which suggest that local and non-local sherds may not be distinguishable from
one another. For example, sherds with design motifs known in the LMV area as

166
âHarrison Bayou Incisedâ, âColes Creek Incisedâ and âEvansville Punctatedâ have
been documented in UTCP assemblages (Ricklis 1994). In UTCP assemblages, these
types are described as âGoose Creek Incisedâ (incised sherds with sandy pastes) and
âSan Jacinto Incisedâ (incised sherds with grog temper). Most of these types are
rounded, globular or jar forms without handles or lugs, similar to vessel forms which
have been described for the UTCP (e.g., Hood 1998; Ricklis 1994; Takac et al. 2000).
Grog-tempered wares with vertical or oblique incised lines resemble the LMV type
âMazique Incisedâ and the Caddo type âDunkin Incisedâ, but these Caddo vessel types
appear to have mostly flat bottoms, which differs from what is currently known about
vessel form in general for UTCP wares (Phillips et al. 1951; Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Baytown Plain, a grog-tempered plain ware has also been documented in the LMV
and UTCP (Aten 1983; Phillips et al. 1951). Sherds with decorative elements common
in Caddo wares have been identified in small quantities in some UTCP sites (Moore,
personal communication 2007; Perttula 2002).

Sedimentary Petrographic Provinces
Multiple factors influence geologic provenance: types of source rocks,
landscape relief, and climate. Landscape relief affects the kinds of source materials
available to local potters, in that the higher the relief, the more rocks and their
constituent minerals are subject to mechanical abrasion. The climate of source areas
can affect the chemical weathering of source rocks and minerals as well; humid
climates often accelerate weathering while arid climates often allow relatively more
rock fragments and feldspars to remain in source materials (Basu 1976; Suttner 1974).

Geologic Setting of the Upper Texas Coastal Plain
The archaeological sites included in this study are located in a region which
spans five major geologic formations. These formations appear as a series of oceantrending wedges of sediment parallel to the coastline. The Trinity and Brazos Rivers
are the major transport agents of sands to and on the UTCP. Both rivers flow through

167
Cretaceous, Permian, and Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks, which include
limestones, shales, sandstones, mudstones, marl, and fossil-bearing rocks (Figure 6.1;
Texas Bureau of Economic Geology 1967, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1982, 1987,
1991, 1992). As a result of these source rocks, as well as the long transport of rock
fragments through humid climates, the minerals common to the UTCP are quartz and
some of the so-called âheavyâ minerals, such as kyanite, hematite, staurolite, garnet,
zircon, and tourmaline, among others (Bullard 1942, Hsu 1960). Feldspars appear in
small amounts, but are generally rarer than in adjacent regions (Bullard 1942, Hsu
1960). Geologic knowledge of the nature and distribution of minerals in recent sands
has been investigated in the Brazos drainage (Sultan 1964). Sultan sampled recent
sands from the Brazos River spanning different ages of bedrock, from Quaternary by
the coastal margin to Permian where the river forks southeast of the modern city of
Lubbock (Figure 6.1). The distributions of quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments are
characterized by high amounts of quartz and rock fragments and low amounts of
feldspars (Figure 6.2). While there is some variability in amounts of these three grain
types, it is important to note that this variability is not patterned within geologic
formations. For example, Quaternary sediments on the gulf costal plain vary
considerably in their quartz and rock fragment content. Geologic formations of other
ages overlap the distribution of Quaternary sediments. Given the overlap in variability
of grain types between bedrock formations, geologic sources in the Brazos River
drainage on upper Texas coastal plain do not appear highly variable.
In order to gain more information about local sources in the Trinity drainage,
sands were collected from Honeycomb (41LB4)âlocated on an old channel of the
Trinity Riverâand a cutbank of the middle Trinity River (Figure 6.1). Sands from
Mitchell Ridge (located on a relict beach ridge on Galveston Island) and a cutbank on
the lower Brazos River adjacent to where Little Bethlehem was originally located
were also sampled in order to get a sense of how sediments from archaeological sites
compared with recent sands from the Brazos and Trinity River drainages (Figure 6.1).

168
Prior to analysis, grain mounts of sand-sized particles were created by splitting and
sieving the sand samples. The thin section laboratory at the Department of Earth and
Space Sciences at the University of Washington mounted the medium size fraction
(0.5-.125 mm) on petrographic slides. The samples were then analyzed to assess the
variability in mineralogical composition and frequency of common minerals such as
quartz, feldspars, and rock grains within and between these samples in order to
determine how much they differed from one another. While all characterized by high
amounts of quartz, sands from both archaeological sites have higher amounts of rock
fragments than the river sediments (Figure 6.3). When compared with recent sands
from the Brazos, the lower Brazos sample from this study has higher amounts of
quartz and lower amounts of feldspars and rock fragments. While there is some
variability in quartz, feldspar, and rock fragment content of sands in the UTCP, there
appears to be little if any pattern to this variability between river drainages, at least
when focusing on the three most common groups of mineral/grain types. Given that
there is little patterned variability between the river drainages of the upper Texas
coastal plain, sourcing pottery from archaeological sites to particular drainage basins
to understand the movement of groups within this region is not promising.
There is the possibility that UTCP geological sources are distinct from adjacent
regions, allowing testing of the mobility and prestige hypotheses which are concerned
with movement and/or trade between adjacent cultural areas. To the northeast of the
UTCP in the Caddoan cultural area is a geologically diverse region (Ferring and
Perttula 1987). Northeast Texas contains the Cretaceous and Tertiary source rocks
through which the Trinity River flows. Outside the Caddoan homeland, but within
their sphere of trade In Southeastern Oklahoma the Ouachita Mountains are comprised
of Paleozoic sandstone and shale which contain feldspars and volcanic/metamorphic
rock fragments. The Wichita Mountains are comprised of igneous rocks, and the Llano
Estacado has metamorphic sediments from the Rocky Mountains (Figure 6.1; Ferring
and Perttula 1987). Given the occurrence of metamorphic rocks in regions like the
Ouachitas, sands from these sources are expected to have high amounts of

169
polycrystalline quartz (Basu et al. 1975). In contrast, sediments from the UTCP are
more mature and most likely have much less polycrystalline quartz as a result of
chemical weathering (Harrell and Blatt 1978). Comparatively little work has been
done with sands from the Trinity drainage (Ferring and Perttula 1987). If pottery was
from plains sources (possibly via Caddo trade), then it would have higher amounts of
rock fragments and feldspars than the more mature sediments/sands from east Texas
and the Gulf coastal plain. Sands from eastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma are
comparatively high in quartz and low in feldspars and rock fragments. Ferring and
Perttula (1987) note that grains from eastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma are
rounded. Their analysis of quartz, feldspar and rock fragments indicates that the
Washita River area has higher amounts of rock fragments and feldspars than the other
areas they sampled. Other areas have less than 10% feldspar and less than 10% rock
fragments. The Ouachita Mountain area has the same amount of rock fragments as the
Washita River area, but lower amounts of feldspars (Q=80-95%; F=3-5%; L=5-15%).
The Sabine River area is distinguished by its relatively high amounts of
monocrystalline quartz.
Analysis UTCP grain mounts created in this study indicates that mineral
assemblages from the Caddoan and UTCP cultural areas do differ from one another
somewhat. Compared with the data in the Caddo area compiled by Ferring and
Perttula, grain mounts of sands from UTCP sites have much lower frequencies of
undulose quartz (Qu) (Table 6.1). Frequencies of polycrystalline quartz (Qp) are
higher in the samples from the Ouchita Mountains and the Washita River than in the
UTCP (Figures 6.4 and 6.5). Feldspars are higher in the Washita River area than in
other areas in the Caddoan region. Yet total feldspars for the Washita River drainage
are similar to frequencies in UTCP grain mounts from this study as well as Sultanâs
data from the Lower Brazos (Table 6.1) Grain mounts prepared for the present study
appear similar in their frequencies of feldspars to previous work with recent sands in
the lower Brazos River drainage (Table 6.1; Sultan 1964). Given this information, it

170
appears that undulose quartz and polycrystalline quartz grain frequencies would be
most helpful in differentiating Caddoan from UTCP sherds.
To the east of the UTCP lies the Mississippi Delta, an area with similar low
relief and humid climate. The source materials of the Mississippi River create mineral
assemblages richer in dolomite, pyroxenes, epidote, biotite, and amphiboles than
further west along the gulf coast (Hsu 1960). In contrast to all of the areas previously
discussed, the mineral assemblages of the central and southern Texas coast are derived
from granites and other Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks, as well as
Cenozoic igneous rocks, and have a high abundance of basaltic hornblende with a very
distinctive red-brown color (Bullard 1942).
In the UTCP, the main geologic formations are composed of highly plastic
clays and clayey sands, which have surface expressions containing clays, sands, and
gravels (Sultan 1964). Given that local clays shrink and swell greatly, it is likely that
prehistoric potters took advantage of the already naturally occurring non-plastic
inclusions to mitigate shrinking during vessel production (Ellis 1995). These deposits
of naturally-tempered clays are thought to have been used by prehistoric people for
pottery manufacture (Aten 1983). Thus, sand-sized particles in the sherd pastes can be
identified and compared to known local sands to determine if the vessels were
manufactured from local materials.

Petrography Methods
In order to compare sherds with grain mounts of the local sand sources, 20
sherds with a variety of non-plastic inclusions, designs, and surface treatments were
selected. Archaeological petrographic studies commonly have sample sizes of 20-40
sherds, most likely because of the time-intensive nature of the analysis and the desire
to avoid destruction of large amounts of an assemblage. During the course of analysis,
one slide was broken. Thus, data is reported for 19 sherds instead of 20. Thin sections
were made by Spectrum Petrographics Incorporated of Vancouver, Washington.
Sherds were impregnated with blue epoxy, and two sections were cut from each sherd

171
perpendicular to the vessel wall and mounted side by side on petrographic slides.
Each slide was ground to a uniform thickness of 30 microns, and the interior wall of
each sherd was marked with an orientation notch on the slide. Initially a few slides
were stained with sodium cobaltinitrite to detect potassium feldspars, and with barium
chloride and rhodizonate to detect plagioclase, as it is often difficult to distinguish
these feldspars from one another as well as from quartz. When it was determined that
there was very little plagioclase in the three samples originally treated, staining was
discontinued for the remainder of the slides, as the stains obscure the visibility of other
minerals.
The thin sections and grain mounts were analyzed using a Nikon Labophot2Pol polarizing microscope with 4, 10, 20, and 40X objectives, using the point counting
method described in Middleton (1985). Points were counted at 1 mm intervals; 200
points were counted in samples where possible, but several sherds were small enough
that this was not possible. In these cases, as many points as possible were counted.
The 20 and 40X objectives were frequently used, as grain sizes in the sherds were
quite small, often only a fraction of a millimeter. In rare instances where an inclusion
or pore was greater than 1 mm in diameter, it was counted once and then skipped over
in subsequent transects. Due to their overall small size, some grains were difficult to
see. Where a confident identification could not be made, the grain was counted as
âunknownâ. Grain mounts were counted using the same method, without counting
pores, bone and grog.
Mineral inclusions were identified based on published descriptions of mineral
relief, physical properties, color, and form (MacKenzie and Guilford 1980; Nesse
1991). Identifications were also made using region-specific descriptions of minerals in
thin section (Bullard 1942).

Results
Frequencies of undulose quartz, polycrystalline quartz, and feldspars in sherds
from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), Honeycomb (41LB4), and Little Bethlehem

172
(41AU38) were compared in this study (Table 6.1). Single factor ANOVA
analysis revealed that these three mineral types do not statistically vary from one
another in any of the three sites, where the critical value for F=3.6337. For undulose
quartz, F=2.1199. For polycrystalline quartz, F=1.4468, and for feldspars F=2.3069.
When compared with UTCP grain mounts, the frequency of undulose quartz content in
sherd thin sections is statistically different (F critical value=3.1273; F=4.5221).
Undulose quartz frequencies in UTCP sherd thin sections are also statistically different
from that reported by Ferring and Perttula (F critical value=3.0724; F=18.0596). In
contrast, there are no statistically significant differences in polycrystalline quartz
content (where F critical value=3.0724 and Qp F=0.7798) and feldspar content
(F=1.2992) between the UTCP and Caddoan sherds. UTCP mineral assemblages
strongly resemble detrital mineral assemblages common to the area and do not contain
basaltic hornblende common in the Rio Grande drainage or the dolomite and
amphiboles present in the Mississippi River delta area (Bullard 1942; Hsu 1960).
Frequencies of undulose quartz do vary between the three sites, but these frequencies
are not as high as those from sherds associated with Caddoan trade (Figure 6.6).

Porosity
Inspection of petrographic thin sections of UTCP sherds indicates that studying
such samples has the potential to provide information on the porosity and permeability
of vessels. Due to the fact that sherd sections in this study were impregnated with blue
epoxy resin, it was easy to identify and count pores while gathering mineral data. The
frequencies of pores in this analysis were determined and then compared with existing
data from two other sitesâ41BO79 and 41GM281âin the lower Brazos area (Skokan
1995, 1996). Inclusions and pores in thin sections from 41BO79 and 41GM281
assemblages were point counted using the same method described in the previous
section (Skokan 1995, 1996). Porosity of sherds from these two sites in the Brazos
River drainage ranged between 4.5-25 percent (Figure 6.7). Sherds from Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66), Honeycomb (41LB4), and Little Bethlehem (41AU38) generally

173
ranged between 8.3-24.4 percent (Figure 6.7). One sherd yielded 32.6 percent
pores. Another sherd had an unusually high amount of pores: sample 41GV66-508-C
from the Mitchell Ridge site had a pore frequency of 44.4 percent. Generally, pores in
the samples from Mitchell Ridge, Little Bethlehem and Honeycomb are lenticular and
oriented parallel to the vessel wall. The pore shapes in sample 41GV66-508-C are also
larger and more rounded than those in the other samples in this study as well as those
from 41BO79 and 41GM281 (Figures 6.8 and 6.9).

Bone inclusions
Sherds with crushed bone in their pastes are fairly common in south and central
Texas, including the interior portion of the upper Texas coastal plain (Hall 1981,
Walter et al. 2004). They are less frequent but sometimes still present on the coastal
margin (Aten 1983). Overall counts of sherds with bone inclusions from the three sites
in this study resembled such a pattern: four sherds from Mitchell Ridge were identified
as containing bone; 49 Honeycomb were identified as having bone. Little Bethlehem,
an inland site had 186 sherds originally identified as containing bone. Of the sherds
thin sectioned, five of the sherds contained bone: two from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66),
one from Honeycomb (41LB4), and two from Little Bethlehem (41AU38). The
amount of crushed bone in the sherds varies considerably ranging from 0.49 percent42.74 percent. Counts of bone in thin sections reveal that some sherds have just a few
pieces of bone (Appendix C; samples 41AU38-72-A2 and 41GV66-413-A), while
others had much greater frequencies of bone. This range in variation of bone
inclusions is reflected in the data collected from sites 41BO79 and 41GM281 as well,
where 10 out of 31 samples with bone (0.5-10.5 percent). Of those 10 samples, 4 had
bone and grog (grog ranging from 6.2-14.5 percentâSkokan 1995, 1996). As
previously noted in chapter four, types of non-plastics in sherds in this study were
often mixed, and the thin section data bear this out as well: one sherd has both bone
and grog; all sherds with bone inclusions also have sand (Table 6.2). Some sherds
originally described as shell in the initial sort using a binocular microscope were

174
determined to contain bone instead when analyzed as thin sections. This is due to
the fact that bone has a distinct structure when viewed in thin section at higher
magnification (Figure 6.10).

Discussion
Generally, the mineral constituents in the sherd thin sections appeared similar to
one another between UTCP assemblages. Monocrystalline quartz is the most common
mineral in all thin sections. Smaller amounts of polycrystalline quartz and undulose
quartz are also present. Small amounts of feldspars are present in all sherds. The
frequency of undulose quartz in UTCP sherd thin sections is statistically different
from UTCP grain mounts, as the sherd sections have higher frequencies of undulose
quartz. Yet the sherd sections have a significantly lower frequency of undulose quartz
compared to Caddoan sherds analyzed by Ferring (Ferring and Perttula 1987). Why
the frequency of undulose quartz in UTCP sherds is greater than UTCP grain mounts,
but less than Caddoan sources, is not clear. Perhaps a greater sample of sands from
both areas would reveal even greater variability within sources than currently realized.
While there are no minerals of non-local provenance in the sherds, the frequencies of
many minerals in sectioned sherds are lower than in the grain mounts. Thin sections
appear to contain almost exclusively quartz and small amounts of feldspars. Larger
portions of a given sherd may need to be sampled in order to generate the frequency of
mineral types similar to grain mounts. The few non-quartz, non-feldspar minerals
observed in thin section correspond with the local mineral assemblage identified by
Bullard and Hsu. Even so, âlocalâ is a broad term in the UTCP. The lower Trinity and
Brazos River drainages appear to have similar mineral assemblages, which is expected
given their similar geologic sources. However, the igneous and metamorphic rocks in
the Caddoan cultural area can allow differentiation between raw material sources in
portions of that area and the UTCP. Given this, analysis of these 19 samples suggests
that people living on the UTCP had little if any contact with their Caddoan neighbors

175
to the northeastâeither through trade or direct movement. Additional sourcing
studies may provide more information on the variability of mineral types in geologic
sources.
Aside from providing information about location of raw materials, analyzing
UTCP sherds in thin section has provided information about the frequency, shape, and
orientation of pores. Pore frequency, shape, and orientation of pores in all but one
sherd were fairly uniform. The exception, sample 41GV66-508-C has a high
frequency of pores relative to the other samples. The shape and size of these pores is
also different from other samples. The sherd was originally recovered from the matrix
of a feature interpreted as house floor, whose surface covered most of a 2x2m unit
(Ricklis 1994). No other sherds used in this study were recovered from features.
Looking at more sherds from the feature may indicate if there is a correlation between
the location of the sherds and their pore structure. Sherds located in features associated
with house areas may have been used for different tasks, or were subject to some sort
of post-depositional leaching in these locations. Perhaps the information on pore
frequency presented here, along with information from two other sites in the Brazos
drainage area can provide a baseline for future studies in the porosity and permeability
of ceramic vessels in this region. Additional information would be helpful in
determining how porous and permeable UTCP pots are.
Analyzing thin sections also provides a more accurate means of identifying
non-plastic inclusions and their frequencies. Sherd sections from two samples in this
study had small amounts of bone, so small as to call into question the idea that bone
was being selected for specific performance properties as a temper. Perhaps bone was
simply incorporated as a result of processing clay in the proximity of household
debris. These low frequencies of bone inclusions may indicate that performance
properties specific to bone were non-existent, not known, or simply not preferred at all
times. The mixture of bone and other non-plastics such as grog and sand may indicate
a desire for any non-plastic inclusions, and thus bone was added as part of a suite of

176
non-plastics rather than being specifically selected, as is plausible in the cases of
sherds with much higher frequencies of bone.
In terms of the hypotheses presented at the beginning of this chapter, the data
from this study support the idea that UTCP pottery was locally manufactured and was
not being obtained from the Caddoâat least not frequently. Instead, the local
provenance of the mineral inclusions in the pastes supports the idea that vessels were
used for everyday utilitarian tasks. Furthermore, the local provenance of these samples
underscores what archaeologists working in the area have commonly assumed; that
UTCP pottery was locally produced. The porosity data are more difficult to interpret
in relation to the original hypotheses, as there is little comparative data on porosity
collected in this area (with the exception of Arnold 1975 for Caddo wares, and Skokan
1995, 1996 for inland coastal plain wares).

Conclusions and future work
Petrographic sourcing is useful in linking pottery with actual geological
sources on the landscape. Petrography is useful in a large regional context such as the
UTCP when looking at interactions between UTCP groups and other groups such as
the Caddo. Future sourcing work on the UTCP may fruitfully focus on possible
interactions between hunter-gatherer groups in the south and central Texas coast and
the UTCP. Sourcing studies may be more fruitful in the Rio Grande, and possibly the
Colorado drainages, the as the mineral assemblages of sands from these drainages are
part of physiographic provinces separate from the Brazos and Trinity sands (following
Hsu 1960).
In addition to sourcing data, petrographic analysis of thin sections can be used
to assess hypotheses concerning the suitability of vessels for liquid storage. Porosity
affects the ability of ceramics vessels to resist spalling and abrasion (both mechanical
and chemical). Vessels with high porosity are also known to have high thermal
insulation. Not only can sherd thin sections be examined to determine the frequency,
shape and orientation of pores, but the size and interconnectedness of pores can be

177
described metrically to create porosity and permeability estimates. Larger sample
sizes are necessary to get an accurate sense of the range in variation of pore size,
frequency, and structure in UTCP assemblages. Experimental work with local raw
materials may clarify exactly what frequencies, shapes, and sizes of pores are most
optimal for tasks such as storage and cooking. Future work can include collecting
information on pore size and placement using petrography and other methods (Harry
2004; Rice 1987).
An additional windfall of petrographic analysis of sherds in thin section is
information on non-plastic inclusions. Using this method to analyze inclusions is not
practical for analyzing the paste of every sherd, but can be useful when accurate
identification of non-plastic inclusions is difficult but highly desired. Analysis of bone
inclusions in thin section may also give more information about what species were
present on archaeological sites, particularly useful information on sites which have no
other faunal remains (Walter et al. 2004). The work presented here helps establish
three data baselines for future studies of sourcing, porosity, and analysis of bone
temper in pottery from this area.

CHAPTER 7: RESDIUE ANALYSIS
Increasing understanding of prehistoric hunter-gatherer diets on the upper
Texas coastal plain (UTCP) allows evaluation of three possible explanations of the
circumstances under which some hunter-gatherer groups choose to make and use
ceramic vessels. This is accomplished by analyzing pottery manufactured by Late
Prehistoric period hunter-gatherers on the UTCP to understand ceramic vessel
function within the context of these societies. Given that ceramic vessels are common
tools in food processing, storage, and serving activities, such research also sets us on a
path of developing ceramic vessel analyses as a way of better understanding diet
among foraging groups, how they cope with food shortages, the relationship between
diet and mobility, and the relationship of food storage to mobility. Information on diet
can also help us better understand the development of social and political complexity
and its relationship to food procurement and/or production.
In accordance with these ideas, three sets of hypotheses were developed and
detailed in Chapter 3. The first set of hypotheses concerns the nature of UTCP
Ceramic vessels in this region may have been used as tools to process starchy seeds
and/or domesticates. An alternate hypothesis is that ceramic vessels on the UTCP were
primarily used as tools to process meat from large-bodied resources. Information on
diet enables us to learn more about ceramic function in this area, but also the
relationships between diet and residential mobility. If pots were used to process
cultigens or wild starchy plants the organic residues recovered from vessels should
reflect this. Likewise, if the predominant organic residues in pots are large mammals,
then they may be the primary resources consumed.
Another aspect of vessel function that has implications for residential mobility
in hunter-gatherer societies is pottery used for storage. As previously discussed,
storage behavior has been observed in hunter-gatherer societies. The kind of storage
strategies foraging societies use is linked to the nature of their particular resource base,
and the degree of their residential mobility. Thus, if and how ceramic vessels were
used for storage has implications for the mobility of hunter-gatherer groups. Storage

190
entails two main types of costs: the cost of preparing resources for storage and the
cost of defending the stores. Bettinger (1999a, 1999b) has identified two basic types of
food storage strategies. Hypothetically, the so-called âfront-loadedâ storage strategy is
most useful to groups who are relatively sedentary and where small-package resources
are common in the diet and sharing is minimal. Such a âfront-loadedâ storage strategy
is used for foods which require a lot of initial time and labor investment to prepare for
storage. Groups engaged in a âfront-loadedâ strategy are willing to store foods which
require a high degree of up-front processing costs prior to storage.
In contrast, a âback-loadedâ storage strategy may be useful in cases where
groups are fairly mobile and are less likely to assume high processing costs up front.
Instead, they are interested in limiting the costs of preparing and possibly losing stored
foods to people or animals that could raid caches. Relatively mobile foragers might
pursue a so-called âback-loadedâ strategy in which focuses on foods which can be
stored with little or no processing. Instead, individuals and groups pay processing
costs when preparing the stored foods for consumption. The âback-loadedâ strategy
enables groups with high degrees of residential mobility to assume fewer costs
associated with processing foods for storage, because the processing costs are only
incurred when the resources are consumed. Any loss of stores due to theft (because
mobile groups cannot always stay in one place to guard their stores) costs less because
little time was invested in processing the resources for storage. Investigating pottery
function may answer questions about the nature of group mobility. With this in mind,
two hypotheses concerned with pottery potentially functioning as storage containers
were developed. The first hypothesis posits that ceramic vessels on the UTCP were
used for âfront-loadedâ storage. If this is the case, the implication might be that groups
had very little residential mobility. The second hypothesis proposes that ceramic
vessels on the UTCP were used for âback-loadedâ storage, and therefore that groups in
this region have high degrees of mobility.
Organic residue data has implications for the storage hypotheses as well. Foods
most commonly âfront-loadedâ include meat, fish, and in some cases processed plant

191
foods (Bettinger 1999a, 1999b; Hally 1983). These foods often have high fat or oil
content that requires them to be processed prior to storage. Due to their high fat/oil
content, they are more likely to be absorbed into the walls of vessels they are stored in.
Therefore, pots used in a front-loaded strategy would be expected to have high
frequencies of organic residue from liquids or fats. In a âback-loadedâ storage
strategy, foods are processed minimally if at all prior to storage, and thus are less
likely to be stored in a state which would allow their residues to seep into vessel walls.
Storage of dry items figures predominantly in âback-loadedâ storage strategies, an
excellent example of a back-loaded food is nuts, which can be stored in the shell. If
pots were used primarily for âback-loadedâ storage, then pots would have little
organic residue signatures, as foods would leave little if any organic residue in the
vessel walls. One possible exception to the âfront-loadedâ= âwetâ/ âback-loadedâ=
âdryâ reasoning is the storage of water which is useful to all groups with varying
degrees of mobility. Water storage vessels would have most of the performance
attributes discussed above, except for a food residue signature. Therefore, water
storage vessels may resemble those used for dry storage and there is no certain way to
distinguish between the two. Porosity may be limited in vessels intended for water
storage, but in some ethnographic cases pots with porous walls may be preferred for
water storage in order to keep water cool (Rice 1987). Thus, there is a possibility that
vessels may have been used primarily to store water is a potential confounding factor
in evaluating storage hypotheses.
Vessels may have been used as items to accrue or increase social, political, or
economic prestige. Not only do ceramic vessels have to potential to be exotic trade
items used to gain and maintain social and political prestige, and they can also be used
as objects for serving or processing rare foods. Vessels from non-local sources may
have functioned as prestige items, indicating to others that their owners were able to
obtain rare, exotic objects. Non-local foods may also indicate political, economic, or
social connections. In some contexts in Eastern North America, maize is an example
of a food whose consumption appears to be restricted to a few high-status individuals

192
in a given group (Hayden 1992; Rose et al. 1991) Such connections may indicate
contact with elites, and/or may have been used to enhance individual or group
social/political standing in local societies. It is also possible that non-local foods were
traded to supplement local food shortages, and had little to do with trade with elites.
For example, the exchange of maize for animal products has been noted in the
American Southwest and Canada (Speilmann 1986; Zarrillo and Kooyman 2006).
These two types of trade might be distinguished from one another by examining the
frequency of non-local foods in pots. A low frequency of non-local foods may indicate
trade with or among elites, while high frequencies of pots with non-local foods may
indicate large-scale group movement. Thus, evidence of exotic foods in upper Texas
coastal plain vessels could lend credence to the idea that pottery was used in prestige
contexts. Wares used for serving or processing non-local foods should bear organic
residues of foods, which in the case of the UTCP is most likely maize. If vessels were
a part of trade with or among elites, then it is expected that a small amount of vessels
in a given assemblage should have residues of non-local foods such as maize.
Extracting and analyzing residues from pottery from these sites can
complement what is currently known about hunter-gatherer diets in this area by
revealing portions of the dietary spectrum (such as plants) that often cannot be
observed by other means (Heron and Evershed 1993). This is especially the case for
the upper Texas coastal plain, where non-shell bearing sites commonly have little or
no faunal remains, and many sites lack human burials. In addition, additional
information on foods contained in UTCP pots can be used to further assess hypotheses
of vessel function, which in turn pertain to the nature of subsistence, mobility and
social stratification in this hunter-gatherer society. Traditionally extraction of organic
residues (particularly lipids) from archaeological ceramics has been used to address
questions about prehistoric diet. Organic residue data may also be useful in
determining if exotic foods were prepared or served in ceramic vessels. Thus, residue
data can also be used to investigate hypotheses concerning the role of pottery in
prestige economies.

193
Ecology of the Upper Texas Coastal Plain: Implications for Hypotheses
The upper Texas coastal plain (UTCP) is divided into four major vegetation
zones: 1) inland longleaf pine and pine-hardwood forests; 2) inland oak savannas and
grasslands; 3) coastal upland prairie; 4) coastal marsh-prairie, including the coastal
margin. Located in a generally humid, subtropical climate, these zones contain
numerous microenvironments such as coastal grasslands, point bar grasslands, riparian
forests, stunted riparian forests, floodplain forests, bluff-top forests, mixed conifer and
hardwood forests, conifer/sweetgum forests, fresh-water swamp, fresh-water and salt
water marshes (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). Various aquatic environments with varying
levels of salinity exist along the gulf shoreline as well: barrier islands, back barrier
lagoonal shoreline, lagoons between barrier islands and the mainland, open primary
bays (such as Galveston Bay), secondary bays (such as Clear Lake, San Jacinto Bay,
Trinity Bay), and river delta areas at the heads of secondary bays (Ensor and Ricklis
1998). These environments have a wealth of wild foods, although the productivity of
the environment does fluctuate during annual and longer-term time scales.

Temporal and spatial availability of food resources on the UTCP
UTCP environments had a variety of large-bodied animal resources. Edible
plants, including species with starchy seeds, are present in this region today, and were
most likely available to prehistoric groups in this region. Inland woods, swamps, and
grasslands contained deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, gray fox, red fox, coyote, skunk,
fox squirrel, opossum, hispid cotton rat, lizards, and birds. In prehistory bison, black
bear, cougar, bobcat were also present. Freshwater streams in the bottoms contain gar,
buffalo, crappie, sunfish, fresh-water drum, channel catfish, and blue catfish (Table
7.1). Nuts such as hickory (Carya sp.), and walnuts (Juglandaceae sp.) are available in
river bottoms, and black hickory with its edible nuts is found on the edge of flood
plains. Pecan trees (Carya illinonensis) are common in stream bottoms in western
coastal plain. Acorns from various oak species are also available. Oak species
(Quercus) with fairly low tannic acid levels (and therefore possibly more palatable)

194
include white (Q. alba), chestnut (Q. prinus), coastal live (Q. virginiana), bur (Q.
macrocarpa), and chinkapin (Q. muhlenbergii). Plants which produce starchy and oily
seeds intensively used in parts of the American Southeast are present on the UTCP.
Amaranth, (Amaranthus sp.) has edible seeds, greens, and can be used as red dye.
Helianthus annus, a member of the sunflower family has edible seeds; Helianthus
maximiliani has edible tubers. Chenopodium (Chenopodiacae sp.), including lambâs
quarters, goosefoot, pigweed, and quelite salado can be eaten as greens, herbs, and
seeds. Seeds can be prepared by grinding into flour, boiling, or toasting. In addition,
many other plants such as docks, pokeweed, thistles, nettles, ground cherries, and
elderberries are available almost continuously throughout the annual cycle (Stahl
1995). Giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida) spreads rapidly through human disturbance
and has edible seeds. It also can be used to make rope, medicine, and dye. Prickly
pear, (Opuntia engelmanni/sp.) has edible fruit and pads. Camass (Camassia
scilloides) can be eaten raw, boiled, or baked. Wild onion (Allium sp.) has edible bulbs
and stalks, and the skins can be used for dye.
Lowland deltaic swamps and marshes were home to raccoon, swamp rabbit,
muskrat, weasel, mink, river otter, and eastern gray squirrel. Reptiles such as alligator,
turtles, and snakes are present in archaeological assemblages, as are frogs and toads.
Other amphibians such as hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), and other
salamanders could have been used as food resources, although whether they actually
were or not is unclear (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). Marine fish species were also present
in river deltas: sea trout, spotted sea trout, Atlantic croaker, red drum, striped mullet,
Gulf flounder, southern flounder, sheepshead, gafftopsail catfish, and blue fish. Clams
(Rangia cuneata) lived in brackish water marshes. Lowland areas have edible plants
which must be processed if they are to be consumed regularly. Arrowhead, or wapato
(Sagittaria sp.), an aquatic plant usually found in shallow wetlands, has edible tubers
(Tull 1987). The tubers of the water lily (Nymphaea odorata) can be baked and peeled
but are inedible when raw. Common in all environmental zones, cattail, (Typha sp.)
has many edible parts. Flower-pod clusters can be boiled and eaten as corn on the cob.

195
Seeds can be separated and parched by burning off fluff. Roots are edible when
boiled or roasted; eating them raw can cause vomiting (Tull 1987).
Coastal margin areas provided access to marine fish species and oyster
(Crassostrea virginica), which lives in more saline environments than the brackish
water clam Rangia cuneata. Although both are available intertidal and subtidal areas
of bays and estuaries, Rangia occupy the first 1-4 m of shallow water in these areas
(Theroux and Wigley 1983). Rangia are influenced by water salinity, which in turn is
influenced by watershed runoff, tide level, and wind direction. They are a patchy
resource; some areas have abundant clams. Large numbers are spawned, and they have
an average lifespan of eight years. Thus, their populations can rebound quickly
(Fairbanks 1963). Cotton rats also available as indicated at coastal sites such as
41GV66, although it is not clear if they were used as food (Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
Major food resources found on UTCP archaeological sites indicate that many
foods were generally available throughout the annual cycle. A possible period of
annual stress may have been late winter/early spring, when fish runs slowed and large
terrestrial mammals had low weights. Groups may have had to retain some degree of
mobility in an environment which was subject to seasonal flooding, as well as
unpredictable storms. Such events almost certainly changed the spatial distribution of
food resources in the region. Various fish species have overlapping spawning times.
Several fish species are available in large amounts as they travel through the passes
between the barrier islands and large and secondary bays. The bottoms of the large
bays are sandy, with mud bottoms around the river mouths. Secondary bays are
mudbottom and shallow and no more than three feet deep. Drum and croaker family
species are commonly found in juvenile and subadult stages in saltwater bays and
lagoons (Ensor and Ricklis 1998). Spotted sea trout frequent bays and beaches in
grassy areas. Black drum have been observed spawning from January-May and JulyNovember in the Gulf near the entrances to bays and lagoons (Nieland and Wilson
1993; Pearson 1929). During spawning, the adults move from bays to the open Gulf in
large schools. This phenomenon is well-known by modern fishermen who place nets

196
over the narrow passes and channels to the secondary bays in order to catch
schooling fish heading into open water. The young return to the secondary bays to
grow to adulthood. In the Northern Gulf black drum weigh on average 20 kg can be
taken with relatively little effort because they spend most of their time in the shallow
waters of secondary bays (Nieland and Wilson 1993). Mature red drum are available
in large schools between August and November between passes in the barrier islands
as they move to the open gulf to spawn. During the cold months, the fish gradually
move out into the deeper waters of the Gulf. When the young hatch they return to the
secondary bays where they live in seagrass beds (Pearson 1929; Soto et al. 1998).
They grow rapidly their first two years, reaching over one foot their first year alone.
They can reach up to five feet in maturity (when they are 3-4 years old). Red drum can
grow quite quickly in high temperature waters and are easy to capture at night when
they spawn (Comyns et al. 1989). They rapidly reappear in bays and lagoons during
the spring. The spotted sea trout spends most of its life cycle in estuarine areas.
Between April and September, spotted sea trout spawn within the bays and lagoons.
The spawning period is protracted, so there are not as many fish present in one place
as with drum species. In the late fall and winter sea trout move to deeper water
because they are sensitive to the cold. They prefer grass-bottomed, shallow bays.
Adults stay in the deeper water, but come near the shore to feed and spawn. Atlantic
Croakers spawn from October to February near the mouths of passes to shallow bays
and lagoons. They are not as available as other fish species because they live mostly in
coastal waters and do not usually live after the first spawning (Pearson 1929; Soto et
al. 1998).
Edible plants would have been available nearly throughout the annual cycle.
From winter through spring, cattail shoots are available. Throughout the spring months
the shoots of river cane are available. Fruits such as dewberries, blackberries,
persimmon, and mulberry appear in April and May. Bulrush roots, shoots and seeds
are available in spring, summer, and fall. Grapes are available in summer. In fall,
tubers and nuts become available, including arrowhead/Wapato (Sagittaria sp.), pecan,

197
black hickory, black walnuts, and various species of acorns. For inland groups,
resource shortages were most likely spatial in nature, such as large game animals
moving or changes in productivity of nut groves (Hall 1998, 2000). For example,
pecan trees produce nut crops every two years.
Resource availability also varies on larger, inter-annual time scales. Tidal
passes can be closed off as sediments shift after severe storms. Fish can die in large
numbers when the shallow waters of the bays become too saline during summer
droughts; cold waves in the winter can kill fish in the more shallow bays. (Pearson
1929). Adult bivalves such as clam and oyster are immobile, and thus highly
susceptible to fluctuations in salinity, temperature, oxygen levels, and turbidity. Red
tides caused by the algae Gymnodinium breve are documented in the Texas portion of
the Gulf and usually occur between August and February (Texas Parks and Wildlife
website). Fillet or muscle parts of fish, crabs, and shrimp are still edible during a red
tide, but oysters, clams, mussels, whelks, and scallops can accumulate toxins in their
tissues which can linger for weeks or months.

Expectations for UTCP hunter-gatherers
Could pottery have been primarily a tool for food storage on the UTCP? As
discussed in chapter two, storage is a most viable strategy when groups are capable of
generating a consistent surplus, and when the distribution of food resources is
predictable in time and space. Other important factors influencing storage are to what
degree groups are willing to bear the costs of preparing foods for storage and
defending the stores, rather than address shortages through sharing. The âpackageâ
size of the resources actually used may also be a factor affecting storage strategies.
Resources in larger packages are more likely to be shared because they come in bulky
packages and thus would not be stored. The spatial and temporal distributions as well
as the population dynamics of the wide array of edible plant and animal species of the
UTCP render long-term storage a strategy of limited appeal for human inhabitants. On

198
the coastal margin, plentiful and temporally consistent amounts of fish could
theoretically be stored. Catastrophic events (weather and other causes of massive prey
attrition) could have affected storage strategies as well, although it is unclear whether
people could have used storage to buffer against such unpredictable losses. Groups
might have had to shift their location to take advantage of other productive groves.
Ready access to resources would have been most easily obtained by maintaining a
degree of residential mobility (Aten 1983).
With the abundance of a variety of wild foods, UTCP foragers would probably
not devote time and energy to processing large amounts of starchy seeds. Instead,
groups would be expected to move when higher-ranked resources with lower
processing costs resources became depleted, unless movement was constrained for
some reason (e.g., environmental packing). Given the spatial and temporal distribution
of food resources on the UTCP, we would expect that foragers in this region would
store little and instead resolve resource shortages primarily by movingâif they were
not otherwise constrained. Coastal margin populations would have access to a variety
of resources predictable in time, but not always in space. Most of these resources have
relatively high processing costs, such as preparing fish and shellfish for storage. Roots
would have required less processing time to store, but they may have been prone to rot
in such a damp climate and could have not been stored for long periods of time.
Significant storage may have been unnecessary and costly strategy for coastal margin
groups.
The nature of food resources in inland environments would be expected to
provide groups there little incentive to store as well. Ethnohistoric accounts indicate
that the prickly pear fruit was widely consumed, but never prepared for storage as it
required too much effort to dry (Kniffen et. al 1987). Still other resources may have
been naturally âstoredâ on the landscape, such as fish arriving during spring floods
and being trapped in small bodies of water (Hall 1998). One commonly used method
of fishing during the contact period was catching a fish in these small pools using bare
hands (Gashtchet 1891). Inland groups did have access to foods which could be easily

199
âback-loadedâ such as nuts and seeds. In sum, many plant and aquatic resources
require labor-intensive processing to prepare them for storage. As long as UTCP
groups had relatively unrestricted movement across the landscape to solve resource
shortages, there was probably very little reason for them to store food. In keeping with
Bettingerâs hypothesis concerning âback-loadedâ storage, it is possible that inland
groups stored nuts as a low-cost way of alleviating resource shortages.
UTCP groups could have obtained non-local foods such as maize from their
Caddoan neighbors. Locally available foods may have been consumed in ceremonial
contexts as well. For example, sotol plants (Dasylirion sp.) grow in the western inland
portion of the study area and can be used to create intoxicants. The historic Karankawa
are described as consuming a caffeinated tea brewed from yaupon leaves (Ilex
vomitoria) in large quantities during celebrations and ceremonial events (Newcomb
1993 [1961], Tull 1987). It is possible that UTCP pots were used to trade, process,
and/or serve maize from or among elites. It is also possible that pots were used to
process and/or serve local foods at ceremonial functions.

Dietary Information from Selected Sites
An examination of the faunal, plant and bioarchaeological remains from the
three sites selected for this study may further refine our expectations for the outcome
of organic residue analysis of pottery. In addition, a review of the faunal remains may
also provide a list of animal resources consumed at the sites which can be compared
with the residues obtained from pottery samples. The amount and types of faunal
remains are discussed in this section. Previous analyses of the fauna at Mitchell Ridge
(41GV66) and Little Bethlehem (41AU38) included gar (Lepisosteus tristoechus)
scales and vertebrae in the number of identified specimens (NISP). The published
report of Honeycomb (41LB4) fauna did not include counts by element, so it is
unknown how much gar scales, vertebrae, and turtle carapace contribute to the NISP at
this site. The number of fish present at these sites was most likely inflated by
including all gar scales and vertebrae, as they are very distinctive and thus could be

200
disproportionately represented in the assemblage. Turtle carapace, gar vertebrae
and scales are very visually distinctive faunal elements. They are more likely to be
identified than other species and thus may be disproportionately represented relative to
other species. This in turn can affect the proportions of fish and reptiles represented at
the sites. Given this, turtle carapace fragments, gar scales, and gar vertebrae were
removed from the NISP for Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Little Bethlehem
(41AU38).
Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) is located on a relict beach ridge on Galveston
Island. Faunal remains recovered from the 1992 excavation include 6,531 bones
identifiable to at least genus, and often species. The analysis of these remains
indicated that the majority of the faunal assemblage was composed of fish (Table 7.2).
Other frequently represented species include shellfish and medium-sized to small
mammals (such as raccoon and cotton rat). In the Mitchell Ridge faunal assemblage
for the block excavation 74 turtle carapace fragments, 2,282 gar vertebrae and 177 gar
scales were identified in the 1992-1994 analysis. When these are removed from the
total number of elements in the assemblage, medium-small mammals become the most
frequently represented group of fauna at the site (Table 7.2). Fish drop to 18 percent of
the assemblage, and the frequency of shellfish increases. These adjustments present a
picture of frequent small mammal use at the siteâmostly hispid cotton ratâ
(Sigmodon hispidus) and use of shellfish, with fish still being fairly strongly
represented in the assemblage.
Honeycomb (41LB4) is located on a previous channel of the Trinity River, and
straddles both brackish and freshwater environments, as well as upland and lowland
environments. Thus, the site would be expected to have a variety of species from these
habitats. Although faunal identifications from the 1994-1995 analysis are not reported
by element, MNI were calculated in addition to NISP tallies. Interestingly, while 4,570
gar elements were identified, the MNI for gar was calculated to be 3. While Shaffer
(1995) reported a total of 17,784 faunal specimens, he was able to identify 8,611 of
these specimens to vertebrata only. Thus, they were left out of the NISP presented

201
here (Table 7.3). Three more specimens could only be identified as âmammalâ and
thus were also left out of the NISP here. The categories for small/medium and
medium/large mammals are used for Honeycomb instead of small/medium and large
mammal categories used for Mitchell Ridge and Little Bethlehem due to the fact that
2,463 specimens were identified as medium/large mammal only. Twenty were
identified as small and or medium mammal, and three were identified as âvery large
mammalâ. Thus, the NISP reported in this analysis is 9,348. Freshwater mollusks
reported from Honeycomb include Glebula rotundata, Lampsilis hydiana, Potamilus
purpurat, and Quadrula apiculata. Rangia cuneata are also reported in the assemblage
(Ensor 1995). The published report of Honeycomb fauna did not include counts by
element, so gar scales, vertebrae, and turtle carapace could not be removed from the
NISP. Based on the 1995 analysis, the faunal assemblage at Honeycomb is dominated
by fish and medium/large mammals (Table 7.3).
The Little Bethlehem (41AU38) faunal assemblage had 429 turtle carapace
fragments. (164 Pseudmys sp.; 130 Terpene sp.; 135 unidentified), 144 gar vertebrae,
742 gar scales, and 426 unidentified fish vertebrae (Lord 1981). When these elements
are removed from the faunal sample, Little Bethlehem still has a high frequency of
reptiles and freshwater fish, followed by large mammals and medium-small mammals
(Table 7.4).

Botanical information
Botanical remains are extremely rare on the UTCP. A few botanical remains
were recovered from Honeycomb, including one hickory nut fragment, and some
bedstraw and pepper vine seeds, the latter of which are known to have been used for
medicinal purposes in other parts of the Southeast (Dering 1995). No botanical
remains are reported from Mitchell Ridge or Little Bethlehem.

202
Skeletal data
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of individuals from the four Late
Prehistoric cemeteries on Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) indicate that people buried at the
site had diets which consisted of 2/3 to 3/4 marine foods (Huebner 1992). Tooth wear
patterns suggest that individuals had diets consisting of âgrittyâ foods. This could
indicate that individuals were consuming high amounts of nuts, seeds, and berries,
and/or the food was poorly cleaned (Powell 1994). Information about diet on the
inland portion of the UTCP comes primarily from a study of Archaic period sites by
Huebner and Button (1992). The analysts concluded that that approximately 85
percent of the diet was comprised on C3 pathway foods, such as deer and nuts.

Methods
Various organic residue extraction methods have been used on prehistoric
pottery for decades (e.g., Dunnell and Hunt 1990; Eerkens 2005; Evershed 1993;
Evershed et al. 1997; Freestone et al. 1985; Heron and Evershed 1993; Hill and Evans
1989; Malainey et al. 1999a, 1999b, 1999c). There have been many recent successful
applications of lipid analysis to archaeological research questions. Dudd et al. (1999)
found evidence for dietary change between Bronze Age and Neolithic occupations at a
site in Wales. Kimpe et al. (2004) used lipid analysis and morphological data to create
a functional classification of wares in southwest Turkey. In North America, Eerkens
successfully identified pinon nut residues in the pottery of Great Basin huntergatherers (Eerkens 2005). Plant residues have been successfully identified in several
studies, most notably leafy plants (Eversherd et al. 1997), and isotopic studies of C3
and C4 plants, including maize (Morton and Schwarcz 2004; Woodbury et al. 1998).
Closer to the UTCP, work in the Caddo cultural area with climate and depositional
environments similar to the UTCP indicates that analysis of lipids from UTCP
ceramics may be successful (Marchbanks 1989). Lipids have also been successfully
extracted from burned rocks in south Texas (Quigg et al. 2001), although further
experimental work on the effects of specific food processing techniques on the

203
integrity of the lipids may need to be done (Buonasera 2005). In contrast, analysis
of organic residues has never been conducted on UTCP ceramics.
Since the early 1990s organic residue research has focused primarily on
identifying plant and animal products associated with lipids (fats and oils). Lipids have
been the primary focus of analyses because they have a high rate of survival in the
archaeological record. These fats and oils (lipids) are mainly comprised of fatty acids,
which are insoluble in water and are more abundant than other lipids such as sterols
and waxes. Fatty acids naturally occur as triglycerides, which are comprised of three
fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule by ester-linkages. Fatty acids are
conventionally referred to using a shorthand format Cx:yÏz. The âCxâ describes
number of atoms which make up the length of the carbon chain of a particular fatty
acid. The âyâ denotes the number of double bonds or points of unsaturation, and the
âÏzâ indicates the location of the most distal double bond on the carbon chain. Thus,
the fatty acid âC18:1Ï9â is a mono-unsaturated isomer with a chain length of 18
carbon atoms with a single double bond located nine carbons from the methyl end of
the chain. Here the shorthand designation is used. For example, âC16:0â refers to a
saturated fatty acid with a chain length of 16 carbons (Malainey, Appendix D).
Lipid analysis has some limitations and potential confounding factors. In lipid
analysis foods cannot usually be identified with a high degree of specificity. This is
because there is a narrow range of fatty acids in most fats and oils. Thus, fatty acid
analyses often focus on making more general identifications of plant and animal
products by matching structures of chemical compounds or relative proportions of a
mixture of compounds to known products (Eversherd 1993). While the fatty acid
composition of uncooked plants and animals provides important baseline information,
it is not possible to directly compare modern uncooked plants and animals with highly
degraded archaeological residues. Certain types of fatty acids, such as unsaturated
fatty acids, are found widely in fish and plants and decompose more readily than
saturated fatty acids, sterols or waxes. During burial, fatty acid constituents can
degrade, disappearing or forming other compounds (see Appendix D for a more

204
detailed discussion). It is also possible that they may be subject to relatively high
hydrolysis and/or contamination from fatty acids from bacteria found in the soil
(Heron et al. 1991; Regert et al. 1998). While fatty acid contamination from the soil
can be factored into residue analysis because of distinct signatures (Evershed and
Tuross 1996), high incidences of hydrolysis may create yields of organic compounds
too low to use for analysis, a special concern with residues from humid, wet
environments such as the UTCP. Even when bacterial contamination can be factored
in to analysis, it is still necessary to compare archaeological residues with known
standards which resemble archaeological residues. Researchers have attempted to
identify archaeological residues using standards (expressed as percentages or ratios)
based on of modern uncooked foods (Marchbanks 1989; Skibo 1992). A major
problem noted by Skibo (1992) is that archaeological residues do not resemble the
original fatty acid composition of modern uncooked foods.
Recent research has focused on identifying criteria which can be used to
distinguish between fatty acid compositions of various foods (Malainey et al. 1999a,
b). Criteria were developed for identifying the fatty acid compositions of 130
uncooked plant and animal species in central Canada (Malainey et al. 1999a,
Appendix D). The work revealed distinct differences between large mammal fat, large
herbivore meat, fish, plant roots, greens, and berries/seeds/nuts (Malainey et al. 1999a,
Appendix D). In addition, 19 modern plant and animal resources similar to those on
the upper Texas coastal plain (e.g., deer, fish, and turtle) were cooked in replica
vessels. Fatty acids were measured periodically during a simulated degradation
process. Similar work was performed with plant and animal resources from inland
south Texas (Quigg et al. 2001; Appendix D).
This work identified seven categories of lipids (Table 7.5). The âlarge
herbivoreâ category is comprised of deer, bison, antelope, javelina, and sotol plants
and is distinguished by high levels of C16:0, C18:1, and C18:0. One known example
of javelina (collared peccary) remains has been noted on the UTCP, but it is not clear
if they are actually associated with human occupation of the area (Lundelius, personal

205
communication 2006). A âhigh fat content foodâ category includes rendered fat
and high fat nuts/seeds and is distinguished by high levels of C18:1 and low levels of
C18:0. A âmedium fat content foodâ category includes mesquite, corn, cholla, fish,
turtle, and snail and is distinguished by low levels of C18:0 and relatively high levels
of C18:1. A âmedium-low fat content plantâ category includes prickly pear and
Spanish dagger pods (the latter of which were probably not present on the UTCP).
This food category is characterized by lipids with low levels of C18:0, and slightly
higher levels of C18:1 than low fat content plants. âLow fat content plantsâ include
greens, roots, some berries, and low-fat/starchy seeds. This category is characterized
by low levels of C18:1 and C18:0 and high levels of medium chain fatty acids. The
mixing of different types of foods can be detected to some extent as well. The âplant
and large herbivoreâ category contains foods described above and is characterized by
high levels of C18:0 and medium chain fatty acids. A âmedium fat content food and
plantâ category is characterized by high levels of C18:1 and relatively low levels of
18:0, plus medium chain fatty acids (for further description and a discussion of the
experimental work, see Appendix D and Malainey et al. 1999a, b, and c). These
findings were then applied to prehistoric assemblages from 18 Western Canadian sites.
The food resources identified by fatty acid composition are consistent with faunal and
tool assemblages from the sites (Malainey et al. 1999c).

Sampling UTCP assemblages

Residue analysis has never been performed on pottery from the upper Texas
coastal plain. For this reason as well as economic constraints it was decided to submit
a small sample of sherds for residue analysis. Vessels may have been used to process
more than one type of resource, although this situation can sometimes be detected
(Malainey et al. 1999c). This potential problem can be mitigated by focusing on
residue signatures across a given site assemblage, rather than focusing on a single pot.
Therefore, multiple samples from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), Honeycomb (41LB4),
and Little Bethlehem (41AU38) were analyzed in order to effectively evaluate the

206
original hypotheses. One set of hypotheses addresses use of pots to process foods
using direct or indirect heat. A potential problem could exist with analyzing the
residues of sherds used over direct heat, as the heat of cooking fires may oxidize food
residues. Since the base of a cooking vessel is more likely to come into direct contact
with fire, it was decided to select rim and neck sherds, which represent portions of the
vessel which residues from cooking come into least contact with heat sources. Vessels
used for boiling foods have been observed to retain organic residues in the rim/neck
area where they naturally collect during the boiling process (Charters et al. 1993). In
order to detect associations between types of cooking and type of resources, sherds
displaying characteristics of use over heat (i.e., sooting and spalling), and attributes
associated with use over heat (grog temper) were selected as part of the sample.
Since it is possible that UTCP assemblages may have been used for both
cooking and storage, residues may be located in different areas of vessel bodies.
Furthermore, given that fatty acids in archaeological ceramics have the potential to
degrade; it is possible that sherds from the UTCP might retain no organic residue
signature. There are two possible explanations for the lack of a residue signature:
either sherds have been subject to post-depositional processes that have affected the
amount of lipids present in a given sample, or foods may have been processed in
vessels using primarily dry processing techniques such as parching and steaming,
rather than âwetâ food preparation techniques such as boiling. These outcomes could
be particularly problematic when evaluating the storage hypotheses. Therefore, lower
body and base portions of the vessels were sampled as well. Contents on bodies and
bases would settle and not be burned off by heat, and the neck which is known to
retain high amounts of residue during boiling (Charters et al. 1997; Malainey, personal
communication, 2004). In order to detect potential use of pots to process non-local
foods, possibly as a part of ceremonies to display or accrue social/political/economic
prestige, sherds with high frequencies of decorative surface treatments were also
selected. An additional sampling consideration was to analyze sherds weighing eight

207
grams or greater, as sherds lighter than this often do not yield enough residue for
analysis (Malainey, personal communication, 2004).
Twenty-six sherds weighing at least eight grams were selected for analysis.
The sample consisted of nine sherds from Mitchell Ridge, 11 sherds from
Honeycomb, and six from Little Bethlehem (Appendix E). In order to address
hypotheses concerning food processing, 11 rim sherds, and 13 body sherds were
selected from each of the three sites. Eight sherds with interior and/or exterior sooting
were chosen for analysis from each of the three sites. Eleven sherds with grog temper
were sampled from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) and Honeycomb (41LB4). No grogtempered sherds large enough for analysis were present in the Little Bethlehem
(41AU38) assemblage. In the interests of obtaining information to help assess the
storage hypotheses, two bases from the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) assemblage were
sampled. The other two sites did not have base sherds large enough for residue
analysis. In order to get a sense of what kinds of foods might be associated with
ceremonial/aggrandizing contexts, three of the most heavily decorated sherds which
were large enough for analysis were selected; a rare cordmarked sherd from Little
Bethlehem (41AU38), and one incised and one punctuate sherd, each from
Honeycomb (41LB4).
Sherd samples were sent to Dr. Mary E. Malainey at the University of
Manitoba for analysis. Samples were prepared by the lab, and a detailed description of
methods and equipment used is provided in Appendix D:269-271. Since residues
from the interior location on the sherd are less subject to post-depositional alteration
than those present on the surface, the first 1-2 millimeters of the outer surfaces were
removed. The inner portion of the sherd was crushed and placed into a solution to
separate organic and inorganic particles from one another (see Appendix D:269 for
specific protocol). The subsequent organic residues were analyzed using a Varian
3800 gas chromatograph (instrumentation and protocol are described in Appendix
D:271).

208
Results
Differentiating small from large mammals and plants from animals was
possible, but pinpointing specific foods (e.g., maize) was not possible. Four sherds, all
from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) yielded no residue. Three sherds had lipid signatures
which resemble the experimental âmedium-low fat plantâ category. Two sherds had
lipid signatures which resemble the âlow fat content plantâ category (Table 7.6).
Sherds from Honeycomb (41LB4) yielded a âlarge herbivoreâ signature, a âmedium
fat content foodâ signature, two âmedium-low fat content plantâ and two âlow fat
content plantâ signatures. Five sherds had âmedium fat content food and plantâ
signatures (Table 7.6). Little Bethlehem (41AU38) has two sherds with âlarge
herbivoreâ signatures, one with a âhigh fat contentâ signature, two âlow fat content
plantâ signatures, and one sherd with a mixture of plant and large herbivore residues
(Table 7.6).

Discussion
The only sherds without lipid signatures are from Mitchell Ridge. These
samples consisted of one rim sherd, two body sherds, and one base sherd. Thus, the
lack of residue does not appear to correspond to a particular part of the vessel. The
sherds come from various horizontal locations on the site: N2E0; N6E0, and N0E2.
The vertical provenience of the sherds is in both levels of the cultural layer (Ricklis
field notes 1992). Thus, the lack of residue on these sherds does not appear to be
correlated with a particular location on the site. Furthermore, other sherd samples from
these locations on the site did yield residues. Perhaps lipids were oxidized when
vessels were subjected to direct heat. Only a small portion (less than 25 percent) of the
exterior of the base sherd has any marks which can be interpreted as sooting. Two of
the Mitchell Ridge sherds without residues have exterior colors suggesting that their
clays were oxidized at some point during manufacture or use. Yet two other sherds
have exterior colors which indicate non-oxidized surfaces. Furthermore, two other
sherds from Honeycomb which yielded residues have exterior colors associated with

209
oxidized surfaces. Perhaps these sherds from Mitchell Ridge were used for tasks
other than food preparation, or were used for âback-loadedâ storage.
All of the âmedium fat content food and low fat plantâ signatures are found on
sherds from Honeycomb. While all of the Honeycomb sherds are grog-tempered, the
five sherds with this particular category of residue do not appear to be limited to a
particular portion of the vessel body, as three rim sherds and two body sherds were
linked with this particular signature. One of the rims was incised. Honeycomb also has
one sherd with a âlarge herbivoreâ signature. Yet large herbivore processing in pots at
these three sites appears to be a rarity. Some differences in types of resources
processed in pots appear between sites. Honeycomb sherds have a âmedium fat
content food and low fat content plantâ signature not found on sherds from the other
two sites. Little Bethlehem has two sherds with âlarge herbivoreâ residues and the
only âhigh fat content foodâ signature in the entire sample. As previously stated, foods
in this category consist of rendered animal fat (including grease and marrow) and nuts,
both of which would have been available in the vicinity of the site. Grog temper, given
its experimental links with proficiency over direct heat, might be linked with particular
food categories which are best processed with prolonged simmering or boiling over
direct heat, such as starchy seeds. Yet there appears to be no correlation between grog
temper and a particular residue signature. Two sherds with tar on their exteriorsâboth
from Mitchell Ridgeâwere included in this study. One sherd had no residue and the
other had a âmedium-low fat content plantâ signature, suggesting that if tarred vessels
were in fact used for storage, they may have been used to store water (which would
leave no signature) and plant foods.
Previously reported faunal data indicate that at Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), high
frequencies of small mammal and shellfish are present. In addition, dietary data from
human remains in the area suggest that individuals interred at Mitchell Ridge
consumed high amounts of marine foods. At Honeycomb (41LB4), the majority of the
faunal assemblage is comprised of fish and medium/large mammal remains. Nut
fragments, possibly related to human consumption, were found at the site. The Little

210
Bethlehem (41AU38) faunal assemblage has high frequencies of freshwater fish
and large mammal. Dietary data from human remains suggest that people living inland
primarily focused on large-bodied mammals such as deer, as well as nuts. In some
cases, organic residues from the sherds sampled in this study reflect the frequency of
resource types in the faunal record. This is not the case at Mitchell Ridge where
organic residues from the sherds do not correlate with the faunal record, suggesting
that even if diets of individuals living at this site consisted predominantly of marine
foods, the pottery assemblage appears to be strongly correlated with processing or
storing plant foods such as prickly pear, greens, roots, berries, and starchy seeds.
Future studies can benefit from more work on the nature of marine food residues in
lipid analysis to make certain that the plants consumed by marine species are not
reflected in the residue assemblage.
Organic residues from sherds in the Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblage resemble
the faunal assemblage to an extent. Medium fat content foodsâpossibly freshwater
fish and turtleâare common in the assemblage, while large herbivore residues are
rare. While plant foods such as prickly pear, greens, roots, berries, and starchy seeds
are present in the Honeycomb samples, nut residues are not. This is interesting
considering that nut remains were found at Honeycomb, a hypothesized nutprocessing site (Ensor et al. 1995). Perhaps pottery was not the chosen tool in
processing or storing nuts. Residues from the Little Bethlehem (41AU38) sherds agree
with what is known about diets in the inland portion of the UTCP: large herbivores
(such as deer), and plant foods such as nuts and grasses.
While limited in size, the data set allows initial assessment of the food
processing, storage, and prestige hypotheses. Sherds with grog temper have a variety
of residues, not just the low-fat content plant residues we would expect to see if these
pots were being used to process starchy seeds. Six of eight sherds with some evidence
of sooting yielded plant residues, suggesting that these plant foods may have been
processed over direct heat. While analysis of sherds in these assemblages indicates
that pots may not have been specifically engineered as storage containers, it can be

211
said that if pots were being used for storage, then this storage was predominantly
âfront-loadedâ. Such a mode is theoretically predicted to be favored by huntergatherers with relatively low residential mobility. If tarring is linked convincingly
linked with storage functions in future studies, then further sampling of tarred sherds
might yield more information on what kinds of items are stored in these vessels.
Identification of residues from the small sample of decorated sherds is not specific
enough to determine if maize was actually in the pots. One sherd from Honeycomb
(41LB4) does have âmedium fat content foodâ, a residue category which includes
maize, but also includes a many other types of foods. All three decorated sherds
sampled have residues associated with plants. These may be non-local resources, or
local plants used for ceremonial purposes. Decorated pots may
simply have plant residues associated with everyday food processing, storage, and
serving activities. In future studies, residues from additional samples of decorated
sherds will need to be extracted to further assess the prestige hypothesis.

Conclusions
While small in scope, this preliminary study indicates that there is promise for
future organic residue studies in the upper Texas coastal plain. Work on refining the
categories of foods identified by residue analysis continues, and future studies in the
UTCP can benefit from it. Further isotopic work along the lines of Sherriff et al.
(1995) may help distinguish between maize and fish signatures from one another, a
distinction very much of interest when testing hypotheses about diet in the UTCP.
However, chemical signatures of maize may not be as detectable as has traditionally
been thought (Reber and Eversherd 2004, 2006).
As previously discussed, theoretical links between diet and residential mobility
enable us to use organic residue data to address questions concerning the residential
mobility, storage strategies, and prestige behavior of hunter-gatherers. This study
provides some preliminary information on vessel use and subsistence and mobility
practices.

CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Goals of the study
The purpose of this dissertation is to evaluate three possible explanations of the
circumstances under which some hunter-gatherer groups choose to make and use
ceramic vessels. This is accomplished by analyzing three Late Prehistoric period
hunter-gatherer pottery assemblages on the upper Texas coastal plain. Pottery can play
critical roles in contexts of subsistence, mobility, and social complexity, but the role(s)
of pottery on the UTCP are not currently understood. Explanations for the continued
use of pottery on the UTCP implicate intense use of plant foods, including starchy
seeds and/or cultigens. Pottery may have become more attractive to UTCP foragers as
their territories became packed through time and group mobility declined as a result of
limited home ranges. Pottery may have also been a useful ceremonial or symbolic
object in yet undocumented social and political contexts. I have used theoretical tools
derived from human behavioral ecology to create models which address the interplay
between physical and social environments and pottery production which I then tested.
Learning more about the functions of UTCP pottery will contribute to our
understanding of UTCP hunter-gatherer diet and mobility, as well as our
understanding of pottery and its context in hunter-gatherer adaptations.

Explanation of hunter-gatherer pottery function: general insights
Manufacturing attributes and use-wear characteristics of ceramic assemblages
from Mitchell Ridge (41GV66), Honeycomb (41LB4), and Little Bethlehem
(41AU38) give a picture of predominantly locally-made, plainware assemblages
engineered for processing foods over heat with low amounts of water, such as starchy
seeds or cultigens. Organic residue and use wear data suggest that pots may have been
used for different tasks at each site. Results indicate that wall thickness of sherds in all
three assemblages was highly uniform within and between sherds. Like Honeycomb
(41LB4), the Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) assemblage has a high amount of grog temper,
an attribute associated with vessels used in direct heating tasks (Table 8.1).

220
Honeycomb (41LB4) sherds exhibit a high correlation between non-variable wall
thickness and grog temper, suggesting that pottery at this site was engineered to be
used over direct heat (Table 8.1). Yet while attributes associated with vessel
construction (especially in the case of Honeycomb) suggest that vessels were
engineered for use over heat, other aspects of the manufacturing processâmost likely
coping with unforgiving raw materialsâare effectively masking evidence of
construction for use over direct heat.
Generally, assemblages from the three sites show little evidence of use wear
characteristics associated with use over direct heat, suggesting that vessels were rarely
used in this manner (Table 8.1). Small portions of the assemblages from each site have
use wear patterns consistent with observed use wear caused by simmering and boiling
in ethnographic assemblages. Low frequencies of spalling on sherd interiors in all
assemblages suggest that vessels used in direct heating tasks may have been used for
processing foods over heat by boiling rather than simmering. Thus, UTCP vessels do
not seem to be used to process large quantities of cultigens or wild starchy seeds very
frequently. The Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) assemblage is a possible exception. Unlike
assemblages from other sites, the Mitchell Ridge sherds sampled had plant residuesâ
or none at all (Table 8.1). The high frequency of plant residues, combined with the
high frequency of interior sooting relative to the other two sites, suggests that pottery
at Mitchell Ridge may have been mainly used to process plant foods over direct heat.
Yet this aspect of the diet is not reflected in isotopic signatures derived from human
remains from the site. Perhaps at Mitchell Ridge pots were used for cooking plants
(starchy or otherwise) while other cooking methods were used for fish and other
foods. Nontheless, the significance of plantsâpossibly starchy plantsâin the daily
diet of people at coastal margin sites such as Mitchell Ridge remains unclear.
In contrast, sherds from the Honeycomb (41LB4) assemblage have relatively
fewer plant residues than Mitchell Ridge (Table 8.1). Honeycomb sherds commonly
have plant and medium-small mammal foods, with some large herbivore, reflecting
both the upland and swamp environments surrounding the site. Given the residue and

221
use wear evidence, it is more difficult to make a case for intensive plant processing
over direct heat at Honeycomb than at Mitchell Ridge. The Little Bethlehem
(41AU38) assemblage is distinctive from the other two in that the frequencies of
sooting and grog temper are comparatively lower (Table 8.1). Residues suggest that
large mammals were more important here than at other sites, not surprising
considering the location of the site is inland, where such resources are expected to be
plentiful. Plant residues are present in some sherds, which could reflect local plant
foods that are available in this area (Table 8.1).
Given the lack of use-wear attributes associated with use over direct heat, it is
possible that vessels were used for storage purposes, although vessel assemblages
have a low frequency of surface treatments associated with storage. If some of the
vessels from these assemblages did function in storage capacities, then the fact that
organic residue data are present on 22 out of the 26 sherds sampled suggest that a
âfront-loadedâ strategy was used, in which most of the food processing costs were
assumed up-front. The expectations developed specifically for UTCP pottery
assemblages state that if hunter-gatherers in this region were utilizing pots for socalled âfront-loadedâ storage, then they would have low degrees of residential
mobility. Paired with the âfront-loadedâ storage expectations, the organic residue data
from these three sites suggest that at least some UTCP groups were fairly sedentary
and possibly stored food. The current methodology does not find support for the idea
of vessels as storage containers. The great majority of sherds analyzed do not fit the
traditional structural profile of storage vessels, but again this may simply be the result
of coping with unforgiving raw materials (making thin-walled pots to prevent failure
during firing). Petrographic data have the potential to provide an understanding of the
extent of residential mobility in the region although the high homogeneity of gulf
coastal plain mineral assemblages should be taken into account when interpreting
these results.
Petrographic sourcing indicates that the vessels are locally made (Table 8.1),
and suggests that people on the UTCP commonly did not move or trade with adjacent

222
cultural areas. However, mineral assemblages over a large portion of the Texas
coastal plain are homogenous. Therefore it is still possible that people were moving
extensively throughout the upper coastal plain but this movement cannot be detected
by sourcing. While additional information on vessel construction and geologic source
of UTCP pottery would be helpful in assessing the hypotheses, initial work using these
methods indicates that future work may not add much more information. While other
sherd assemblages in this area can and should be investigated in terms of vessel
construction, it is highly probable that the nature of the raw materials in this area will
continue to obscure our understanding of how vessel construction relates to function.
Local source materials are very homogenous in this region, and future sourcing studies
should take this into account.
The hypothesis that pottery on the UTCP was used as part of social
aggrandizing and other prestige behavior is not well supported by the data. Pottery
assemblages have low amounts (five percent or less) of decorative surface treatments
(Table 8.1). Sourcing data indicate local geological sources for raw materials,
indicating that these are not exotic trade wares. Nonetheless, pottery could have been
used to process substances in ceremonial activities which could be implicated with
accruing or maintaining social or economic prestige. Food identifications were not
specific enough to determine if exotic foods (such as maize) were present in the vessel
assemblages.
Evaluating models of settlement and subsistence using these three UTCP
pottery assemblages was based on the premise that they were contemporaneous.
Sherds from the Mitchell Ridge and Little Bethlehem assemblages have earlier dates
than Honeycomb, suggesting that some ceramics from each site are from the Late
Prehistoric, but maybe not all. While only some dates correlate well with previously
obtained radiocarbon dates, other younger dates on sherds from Mitchell Ridge and
Little Bethlehem suggest that radiocarbon dates from both of these sites could not
accurately date ceramic use on the sites (Table 8.1). In the cases of Mitchell Ridge the
radiocarbon dates obtained from the block excavation do not appear to reflect the

223
timing of all prehistoric activity in this area of the site. Despite the homogenous
stratigraphy and lone radiocarbon date at Little Bethlehem, the luminescence dates
from sherds in this study indicate there is apparently a much longer span of time than
originally thought, or that older ceramics were curated and brought to newer
occupations. Since radiocarbon and thermoluminescence methods date different
events, this might also explain some of the discrepancies.

Assessing the Akokisa model
While the results of these analyses do not unequivocally disprove any other of
the three vessel function hypotheses, they do provide more insight on mobility patterns
and diet. Assuming that at least some of the portions of the sites are contemporaneous,
I suggest that there were two separate populations on the upper Texas coastal plain, a
relatively sedentary coastal population relying primarily on small-bodied, r-selected
resources, and a more mobile inland population using greater amounts of large-bodied
resources.
Residue data from this study indicate that the UTCP diets differ between sites
in different environmental zones. Some morphological and use wear data indicate that
pots at coastal margin sites were used differently than those at inland sites. Organic
residues from coastal margin sherd samples indicate a reliance on small-bodied
resources. Large mammal residues are not present in the Mitchell Ridge samples.
Sherd samples with plant residues may indicate use of starchy seeds and/or cultigens,
but the general nature of lipid residues makes this idea difficult to evaluate.
Nonetheless, the high frequency of r-selected resource residues on sherds from coastal
margin sites does lend support to the idea that coastal margin populations were
experiencing some territorial constraint and were broadening their diet as the result of
their inability to pursue large-bodied resources frequently. However, residue analysis
of more sherds from coastal margin and inland sites needs to be done before these
conclusions can be accepted. Given that the UTCP coastal margin was a highly
consistent and productive environment, coastal margin groups may have had incentive

224
to be sedentary even without territorial constraints and/or resource depression.
Whether sedentism at these sites is actually the result of environmental
circumscription due to environmental packing needs to be
further evaluated using other archaeological data, such as dietary and disease stress
data from human remains.
Organic residue data from samples of Little Bethlehem (41AU38) sherds
suggest that pots were not being used to process small-bodied resources or starchy
seeds in the inland portion of the UTCP. In terms of the Akokisa model, inland groups
could have been experiencing territorial constraints during the late Prehistoric or
earlier. Ceramic vessels among inland groups suggests resource depression of large
mammalsâthe result of larger populations, more constrained territories, or both.
Looking more closely at the faunal record may provide insight on the question of
resource depression (e.g, Densmore et al. 2007; Fullerton et al. 2007). The suitability
of pottery for processing plant foods suggests its utility to coastal margin populations.
The function of pottery for inland groups with apparently higher degrees of residential
mobility needs to be investigated further. Future research on upper Texas coastal plain
pottery and faunal assemblages can be used to evaluate the idea of two distinct
populations using ceramic vessels as a part of two different adaptations.

Future research
Experimental work
Additional knowledge of particular cooking techniques will be useful in
assessing hypotheses of vessel function and use (Sillar 2003). More experimental
work needs to be done in this area to determine if cooking methods using low amounts
of liquid are truly useful in processing starchy plant materials, particularly native
edible plants in the upper Texas coastal plain region. Existing experimental studies
have produced useful but conflicting information about whether boiling is particularly
suited to processing starchy plants and seeds or breaking down the connective tissue in
meat (Reid 1990; Skibo 1992). Skibo obtained use wear data on pots used to cook rice

225
using low amounts of liquid, and observed that other plant materials were boiled
using higher amounts of water. Reidâs statements that pots were used to boil meat are
based on ethnohistoric data. Yet Hally points out that pot walls frequently spall when
liquid used to cook starchy seeds to a gelatinous consistency evaporates.
The nature of porosity of UTCP wares should be further investigated as well.
Porosity of vessel walls affects both heating and storage properties of the vessel, but
specific information is lacking. Future studies could focus on how long it takes water
to boil in experimentally replicated vessels with differing amounts of porosity. Pore
structure and frequency of these vessels could then be examined in thin section. Some
surface treatments (namely tar) indicate that pots from UTCP sites may also have been
used for storage, but it is not clear from the non-destructive data what fraction of the
vessel assemblages were used for storing foodstuffs. Future experimental
investigations could develop baselines for porosity, and determine if tar is effective in
limiting porosity on cooking vessels, or if it simply melts off the pot surface when the
vessel is heated.

Investigating other cooking technologies
Further investigation of cooking techniquesâwith pots and other
technologiesâ is also warranted. Clay balls have been documented in the UTCP,
suggesting that other cooking technologies in addition to pottery were used in this
area. The age and of clay balls is not well documented. Their distribution appears
limited to the southern inland portion of the UTCP (Patterson 1993), although workers
in the region have only recently begun to systematically document their presence.
Currently their function is assumed to be related to cooking, but this is uncertain. The
presence of clay balls at some inland sites has been interpreted to mean that indirect
boiling methods were used (Ellis 1995; Patterson 1993). Additional information about
clay balls, such as whether they were used instead of or in addition to pottery could be
useful in understanding the evolution and function of pottery on the UTCP. Future
research on cooking technology in the UTCP should include closer examination of the

226
regional distribution and functions of clay balls. Organic residue studies and
luminescence dating may enable us to learn more about the function and spatial and
temporal distribution of these possible cooking implements.

Refining methods introduced in this study
Further work with organic residues and temper may improve our
understanding of vessel use and function on the UTCP. Organic residue analysis is a
promising technique that can greatly contribute to knowledge of UTCP diet. While
initially successful, this method needs to be refined for further application in the
region. Developing standards for marine foods is a logical next step, and work has
already begun (Malainey personal communication 2006). Detecting maize does not
appear as promising (Reber and Evershed 2004, 2006). Further work on the
performance properties of bone temper will also be useful. It is not clear what specific
qualities of bone might have been of value to prehistoric potters. Perhaps bone was
simply plentiful and therefore useful in increasing the workability of highly plastic
local clays. The frequencies of bone and grog non-plastics in the sherds from all three
assemblages often occur in amounts well below 50 percent. Cross sections of some
sherds show only one or two pieces of bone or grog, apparently far too little to have
any appreciable affect on vessel performance. Different types of inclusions often cooccur in a single sherd, suggesting that the specific properties of a particular inclusion
may not have been so important. Rather, the presence of any non-plastics may have
been sufficient to insure optimal performance during manufacture or use.

Ceramic origins
Although this study did not focus on ceramic origins, why UTCP huntergatherers chose to make and use pottery when they did can provide more information
on hunter-gatherer evolution. The information on function provided in this study is a
start in this direction. Further investigation of the faunal record in pre-ceramic and
ceramic period occupations is currently underway and may provide information on

227
why pottery became attractive to UTCP hunter-gatherers when it did (Nagaoka
personal communication 2006). More information on the timing and pace of pottery
adoption is also desirable. Luminescence dates in this study suggest an earlier arrival
of pottery in the inland portion of the UTCP than previously known. The fact that
luminescence dates obtained in their study are few and that some have large error
terms actually supports the idea that more UTCP ceramics should be dated in order to
provide more data points and thereby increase our ability to interpret dates on pottery.
The premise that pottery use relates to social and economic behavior enables
studies of pottery function to provide information on the variability in organization in
hunter-gatherer societies. The work presented here is a step toward understanding the
functions and uses of hunter-gatherer ceramics in order to address questions of more
general anthropological interest concerning hunter-gatherer economic and social
adaptations.

APPENDIX A: LUMINESCENCE DATING OF POTTERY FROM THE
UPPER TEXAS COASTAL PLAIN
9 June 2006
James Feathers
Luminescence Dating Laboratory
University of Washington
Seattle, WA
Ten ceramic sherds from three sites on the Upper Texas coastal plain were
submitted for luminescence dating by Larkin Hood, as part of her dissertation work on
ceramic production and use. Pertinent data on the sherds are given in Table A.1.
Laboratory procedures are given in the appendix.
Internal radioactivity (from the sherds themselves) did not vary much among
sherds from the same site, but did vary among sites. If other compositional
information follows the same pattern, it could mean the pottery was manufactured
from local materials. Internal dose rate constituted from 65-85% of the total dose rate.
External dose rate was measured from one sediment sample for each site, and also
included the cosmic contribution. Radioactivity values are given in Table A.2. Also
given are the beta dose rates as derived from beta counting and as calculated from
alpha counting and flame photometry, assuming secular disequilibrium. No significant
differences in beta dose rate were discernable. Final dose rates are given in Table A.3.
These include correction for moisture content. The environment is fairly moist and the
sherds were assumed to have retained on average 80 Â± 20 % of their absorbed water
capacity.
Equivalent dose was determined both by thermoluminescence (TL) and by
optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The OSL measurements included an
infrared exposure (IRSL) prior to blue light stimulation, but only five of the sherds
showed an IRSL signal and it is not considered further. Various data are given in
Table A.4.

259
The TL plateau regions on all sherds were relatively broad (>60Â°C), except
for UW1338, but this one was constrained mainly by alpha efficiency. After the slide
procedure (moving the additive dose curves into near coincidence with the
regenerative curves by best fit), the growth curves for all samples passed through the
origin, indicating no anomalous behavior.
The OSL behavior was a little more peculiar. On two samples (UW1335 and
UW1336), the natural signal was much, much higher than the signal from the highest
regeneration dose. Even if we used higher regeneration doses and were able to capture
the natural signal, the resulting ages would be older than reasonable (pre-pottery). On
one other sample, UW1333, the natural signal intersected the regeneration growth
curve, but still produced a large equivalent dose with a correspondingly unreasonably
old age. On all three of these samples, the equivalent dose was only determined by TL.
On two more samples, UW1330 and UW1331, the OSL also produced fairly old ages,
but not outside the realm of reason. I do not understand at this point the unreasonably
high OSL signals. Possibly the OSL signal was not reset in antiquity, leaving a
geologic residual, but all of these sherds had broad TL plateaus, which would not be
expected for a poorly heated sample. For now they must be considered anomalous.
TL fading tests were performed on all but three samples. The OSL signal is not
expected to fade significantly. Four samples (UW1331, UW1336, UW1338, and
UW1339) exhibited significant TL fading, and the TL age was subsequently corrected
using the method of Huntley and Lamothe (2001). On two samples (UW1332 and
UW1334) fading was not significant, and on one sample (UW1335) the data were too
scattered to make a judgment. On one of the samples where fading was not tested
(UW1337), the TL and OSL ages were in agreement, so it is assumed fading is not
significant. On the other two (UW1330 and UW1333), fading cannot be discounted, so
the TL ages must be considered minimum.
The b-value, used to adjust for lower efficiency of alpha radiation in producing
luminescence, was determined for all samples using TL and for six of the samples

260
using OSL. The b-value for OSL varied little among samples so an average (0.669
Â± 0.119 Gy Âµm2) was taken as the best estimate for the samples not measured.
Table 5 gives the derived ages. Because of the high OSL, the TL was taken to
be the best estimate of age for UW1332, UW1335, and UW1336. The TL ages
(corrected for fading where appropriate) and OSL ages agreed on five sherds
(UW1331, UW1334, UW1337, UW1338, and UW1339) and a weighted average was
taken as the best estimate. Because the TL can only be considered a minimum age
(because of possible fading) on UW1333, the OSL age is considered the best estimate
for that sample. UW1330 is problematic. The TL age must be considered a minimum
because of possible fading, but it falls within the same general range as UW1332 and
UW1333 from the same site. Plus it is in the right stratigraphic order. The OSL is
much older, but is in agreement with the age (from both TL and OSL) of UW1331.
Both ages are given in Table 5.
Interpretation of the ages is not straightforward. The ages of five of the
samples are close to expectations. The TL age of UW1330 is also close to expectations
if the OSL result can be considered anomalous. The other three samples (UW1331,
UW1335 and UW1336) are much older than expected. These cannot be dismissed
because of anomalous OSL, because for UW1331 the OSL and TL ages agree and for
the other two samples, the ages are based on TL only. Perhaps consideration should be
given to the possibility that the two sites from which these samples were taken have an
earlier component (or at least older ceramics). Sand-tempered ceramics have been
made on the Texas coast for two millennia. Should it be completely out of the
question, that some older ceramics have found their way into sites that were generally
occupied at a later date?

Appendix: Procedures for Thermoluminescence Analysis of Pottery
Sample preparation -- fine grain
The sherd is broken to expose a fresh profile. Material is drilled from the
center of the cross-section, more than 2 mm from either surface, using a tungsten

261
carbide drill tip. The material retrieved is ground gently by a corundum mortar
and pestle, treated with HCl, and then settled in acetone for 2 and 20 minutes to
separate the 1-8 Âµm fraction. This is settled onto a maximum of 72 stainless steel
discs.

Glow-outs
Thermoluminescence is measured by a Daybreak reader using a 9635Q
photomultiplier with a Corning 7-59 blue filter, in N2 atmosphere at 1Â°C/s to 450Â°C. A
preheat of 240Â°C with no hold time precedes each measurement. Artificial irradiation
is given with a 241Am alpha source and a 90Sr beta source, the latter calibrated against
a 137Cs gamma source. Discs are stored at room temperature for at least one week after
irradiation before glow out. Data are processed by Daybreak TLApplic software. For
feldspars, a blue-green Schott BG39 filter is used for emission.

Fading test
Several discs are used to test for anomalous fading. The natural luminescence
is first measured by heating to 450Â°C. The discs are then given an equal alpha
irradiation and stored at room temperature for varied times: 10 min, 2 hours, 1 day, 1
week and 8 weeks. The irradiations are staggered in time so that all of the second
glows are performed on the same day. The second glows are normalized by the natural
signal and then compared to determine any loss of signal with time (on a log scale). If
the sample shows fading and the signal versus time values can be reasonably fit to a
logarithmic function, an attempt is made to correct the age following procedures
recommended by Huntley and Lamothe (2001).
Equivalent dose
The equivalent dose is determined by a combination additive dose and
regeneration (Aitken 1985). Additive dose involves administering incremental doses
to natural material. A growth curve plotting dose against luminescence can be

262
extrapolated to the dose axis to estimate an equivalent dose, but for pottery this
estimate is usually inaccurate because of errors in extrapolation due to nonlinearity.
Regeneration involves zeroing natural material by heating to 450Â°C and then
rebuilding a growth curve with incremental doses. The problem here is sensitivity
change caused by the heating. By constructing both curves, the regeneration curve can
be used to define the extrapolated area and to correct for sensitivity change by
comparing it with the additive dose curve. This works where the shapes of the curves
differ only in scale (i.e., the sensitivity change is independent of dose). The curves are
combined using the âAustralian slideâ method in a program developed by David
Huntley of Simon Fraser University (Prescott et al. 1993). The equivalent dose is
taken as the horizontal distance between the two curves after a scale adjustment for
sensitivity change. Where the growth curves are not linear, they are fit to quadratic
functions. Dose increments (usually five) are determined so that the maximum
additive dose results in a signal about three times that of the natural and the maximum
regeneration dose about five times the natural. If the regeneration curve has a
significant negative intercept, which is not expected given current understanding, the
additive dose intercept is taken as the best, if not fully reliable approximation.
A plateau region is determined by calculating the equivalent dose at
temperature increments between 240Â° and 450Â°C and determining over which
temperature range the values do not differ significantly. This plateau region is
compared with a similar one constructed for the b-value (alpha efficiency), and the
overlap defines the integrated range for final analysis.

Alpha effectiveness
Alpha efficiency is determined by comparing additive dose curves using alpha
and beta irradiations. The slide program is also used in this regard, taking the scale
factor (which is the ratio of the two slopes) as the b-value (Aitken 1985).

263
Radioactivity
Radioactivity is measured by alpha counting in conjunction with atomic
emission for 40K. Samples for alpha counting are crushed in a mill to flour
consistency, packed into plexiglass containers with ZnS:Ag screens, and sealed for
one month before counting. The pairs technique is used to separate the U and Th
decay series. For atomic emission measurements, samples are dissolved in HF and
other acids and analyzed by a Jenway flame photometer. K concentrations for each
sample are determined by bracketing between standards of known concentration.
Conversion to 40K is by natural atomic abundance. Radioactivity is also measured, as a
check, by beta counting, using a RisÃ¸ low level beta GM multicounter system. About
0.5 g of crushed sample is placed on each of four plastic sample holders. All are
counted for 24 hours. The average is converted to dose rate following BÃ¸tter-Jensen
and Mejdahl (1988) and compared with the beta dose rate calculated from the alpha
counting and flame photometer results.
Both the sherd and an associated soil sample are measured for radioactivity.
Additional soil samples are analyzed where the environment is complex, and gamma
contributions determined by gradients (after Aitken 1985: appendix H). Cosmic
radiation is determined after Prescott and Hutton (1988). Radioactivity concentrations
are translated into dose rates following Adamiec and Aitken (1998).

Moisture Contents
Water absorption values for the sherds are determined by comparing the
saturated and dried weights. For temperate climates, moisture in the pottery is taken to
be 80 Â± 20 percent of total absorption, unless otherwise indicated by the archaeologist.
Again for temperate climates, soil moisture contents are taken from typical moisture
retention quantities for different textured soils (Brady 1974: 196), unless otherwise
measured. For drier climates, moisture values are determined in consultation with the
archaeologist.

264
Procedures for Optically Stimulated or Infrared Stimulated Luminescence of
Fine-grained pottery.
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or infrared stimulated luminescence
(IRSL) on fine-grain (1-8Âµm) pottery samples is carried out on single aliquots
following procedures adapted from Banerjee et al. (2001), and Roberts and Wintle
(2001). Equivalent dose is determined by the single-aliquot regenerative dose (SAR)
method (Murray and Wintle 2000).
The SAR method measures the natural signal and the signal from a series of
regeneration doses on a single aliquot. The method uses a small test dose to monitor
and correct for sensitivity changes brought about by preheating, irradiation or light
stimulation. SAR consists of the following steps: 1) preheat, 2) measurement of
natural signal (OSL or IRSL), L(1), 3) test dose, 4) cut heat, 5) measurement of test
dose signal, T(1), 6) regeneration dose, 7) preheat, 8) measurement of signal from
regeneration, L(2), 9) test dose, 10) cut heat, 11) measurement of test dose signal,
T(2), 12) repeat of steps 6 through 11 for various regeneration doses. A growth curve
is constructed from the L(i)/T(i) ratios and the equivalent dose is found by
interpolation of L(1)/T(1). Usually a zero regeneration dose and a repeated
regeneration dose are employed to insure the procedure is working properly. For finegrained ceramics, a preheat of 240Â°C for 10s, a test dose of 1.8 Gy, and a cut heat of
160Â°C are currently being used, although these parameters may be modified from
sample to sample.
The luminescence, L(i) and T(i), is measured on a RisÃ¸ TL-DA-15 automated
reader by a succession of two stimulations. First 100 s at 125Â°C of IRSL (880nm
diodes), and second 100s at 125Â°C of OSL (470nm diodes). The OSL is also called
blue stimulated luminescence (BSL). Detection is through 7.5mm of Hoya U340
(ultra-violet) filters. The two stimulations are used to construct IRSL and OSL growth
curves, so that two estimations of equivalent dose are available. Only feldspars are
sensitive to IRSL, but they are also sensitive to blue light, but current data suggest that

265
most of the feldspar signal is removed by the IRSL stimulation, so that the OSL
signal arises predominantly from quartz. This may mean that the OSL signal does not
suffer from anomalous fading, but the procedure is still undergoing study and may be
modified in the future.
Alpha efficiency differs among IRSL, OSL and TL on fine-grained materials.
The b-value was measured for OSL and IRSL by adding two alpha irradiations to the
SAR sequence (still maintaining a test dose with beta radiation) and using the
difference in slopes between the beta and alpha growth curves to determine as the bvalue. The b-value for OSL has been found not to vary much and seems to center
around 0.6-0.7 for most samples.

APPENDIX D: ANALYSIS OF THE FATTY ACID COMPOSITIONS OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL POTTERY RESIDUES FROM
SITES 41AU38, 41GV66, AND 41LB4.
by
M. E. Malainey. Ph.D.
11 Mager Drive West
Winnipeg, MB
Canada R2M 0R9
Introduction
A total of 23 potsherds from three sites 41AU38, 41GV66 and 41LB4, were
submitted for analysis; where possible, subsamples were taken from larger sherds.
Exterior surfaces were ground off to remove any contaminants and samples were
crushed. Absorbed lipid residues were extracted with organic solvents. Fatty acid
components of the lipid extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography. Residues
were identified using criteria developed from the decomposition patterns of experimental
residues. The first section of this report outlines the development of the identification
criteria. Following this, analytical procedures and results are presented.

Fatty Acids and Development of the Identification Criteria
Introduction and Previous Research
Fatty acids are the major constituents of fats and oils (lipids) and occur in nature
as triglycerides, consisting of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule by esterlinkages. The shorthand convention for designating fatty acids, Cx:yÏz, contains three
components. The âCxâ refers to a fatty acid with a carbon chain length of x number of
atoms. The âyâ represents the number of double bonds or points of unsaturation, and the
âÏzâ indicates the location of the most distal double bond on the carbon chain, i.e.
closest to the methyl end. Thus, the fatty acid expressed as C18:1Ï9, refers to a mono-

278
unsaturated isomer with a chain length of 18 carbon atoms with a single double bond
located nine carbons from the methyl end of the chain. Similarly, the shorthand
designation, C16:0, refers to a saturated fatty acid with a chain length of 16 carbons.
Their insolubility in water and relative abundance compared to other classes of
lipids, such as sterols and waxes, make fatty acids suitable for residue analysis. Since
employed by Condamin et al. (1976), gas chromatography has been used extensively to
analyze the fatty acid component of absorbed archaeological residues. The composition
of uncooked plants and animals provides important baseline information, but it is not
possible to directly compare modern uncooked plants and animals with highly degraded
archaeological residues. Unsaturated fatty acids, which are found widely in fish and
plants, decompose more readily than saturated fatty acids, sterols or waxes. In the course
of decomposition, simple addition reactions might occur at points of unsaturation
(Solomons 1980) or peroxidation might lead to the formation of a variety of volatile and
non-volatile products which continue to degrade (Frankel 1991). Peroxidation occurs
most readily in fatty acids with more than one point of unsaturation.
Attempts have been made to identify archaeological residues using criteria that
discriminate uncooked foods (Marchbanks 1989; Skibo 1992; Loy 1994). Marchbanksâ
(1989) percent of saturated fatty acids (%S) criteria has been applied to residues from a
variety of materials including pottery, stone tools and burned rocks (Marchbanks 1989;
Marchbanks and Quigg 1990; Collins et al. 1990). Skibo (1992:89) could not apply the
%S technique and instead used two ratios of fatty acids, C18:0/C16:0 and C18:1/C16:0.
He (1992) reported that it was possible to link the uncooked foods with residues
extracted from modern cooking pots actively used to prepare one type of food; however,
the ratios could not identify food mixtures. The utility of these ratios did not extend to
residues extracted from archaeological potsherds because the ratios of the major fatty
acids in the residue changed with decomposition (Skibo 1992:97). Loy (1994) proposed
the use of a Saturation Index (SI), determined by the ratio: SI = 1[(C18:1+C18:2)/C12:0+C14:0+C16:0+C18:0)]. He (1994) admitted, however, that

279
poorly understood decompositional changes to the original suite of fatty acids make it
difficult to develop criteria for distinguishing animal and plant fatty acid profiles in
archaeological residues.
The major drawback of the distinguishing ratios proposed by Marchbanks (1989),
Skibo (1992) and Loy (1994) is they have never been empirically tested. The proposed
ratios are based on criteria that discriminate food classes on the basis of their original
fatty acid composition. The resistance of these criteria to the effects of decompositional
changes has not been demonstrated. Rather, Skibo (1992) found his fatty acid ratio
criteria could not be used to identify highly decomposed archaeological samples.
In order to identify a fatty acid ratio unaffected by degradation processes, Patrick
et al. (1985) simulated the long-term decomposition of one sample and monitored the
resulting changes. An experimental cooking residue of seal was prepared and degraded in
order to identify a stable fatty acid ratio. Patrick et al. (1985) found that the ratio of two
C18:1 isomers, oleic and vaccenic, did not change with decomposition; this fatty acid
ratio was then used to identify an archaeological vessel residue as seal. While the fatty
acid composition of uncooked foods must be known, Patrick et al. (1985) showed that
the effects of cooking and decomposition over long periods of time on the fatty acids
must also be understood.

Development of the Identification Criteria
As the first stage in developing the identification criteria used herein, the fatty
acid compositions of more than 130 uncooked Native food plants and animals from
Western Canada were determined using gas chromatography (Malainey 1997; Malainey
et al. 1999a). When the fatty acid compositions of modern food plants and animals were
subject to cluster and principal component analyses, the resultant groupings generally
corresponded to divisions that exist in nature (Table D.1). Clear differences in the fatty
acid composition of large mammal fat, large herbivore meat, fish, plant roots, greens and
berries/seeds/nuts were detected, but the fatty acid composition of meat from medium-

280
sized mammals resembles berries/seeds/nuts.
Samples in cluster A, the large mammal and fish cluster had elevated levels of
C16:0 and C18:1 (Table D.1). Divisions within this cluster stemmed from the very high
level of C18:1 isomers in fat, high levels of C18:0 in bison and deer meat and high levels
of very long chain unsaturated fatty acids (VLCU) in fish. Differences in the fatty acid
composition of plant roots, greens and berries/seeds/nuts reflect the amounts of C18:2
and C18:3Ï3 present. The berry, seed, nut and small mammal meat samples appearing in
cluster B have very high levels of C18:2, ranging from 35% to 64% (Table D.1).
Samples in subclusters V, VI and VII have levels of C18:1 isomers from 29% to 51%, as
well. Plant roots, plant greens and some berries appear in cluster C. All cluster C samples
have moderately high levels of C18:2; except for the berries in subcluster XII, levels of
C16:0 are also elevated. Higher levels of C18:3Ï3 and/or very long chain saturated fatty
acids (VLCS) are also common except in the roots which form subcluster XV.
Secondly, the effects of cooking and degradation over time on fatty acid
compositions were examined. Originally, 19 modern residues of plants and animals from
the plains, parkland and forests of Western Canada were prepared by cooking samples of
meats, fish and plants, alone or combined, in replica vessels over an open fire (Malainey
1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). After four days at room temperature, the vessels were
broken and a set of sherds analysed to determine changes after a short term of
decomposition. A second set of sherds remained at room temperature for 80 days, then
placed in an oven at 75Â°C for a period of 30 days in order to simulate the processes of
long term decomposition. The relative percentages were calculated on the basis of the ten
fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1w9, C18:1w11,
C18:2) that regularly appeared in Precontact Period vessel residues from Western
Canada. Observed changes in fatty acid composition of the experimental cooking
residues enabled the development of a method for identifying the archaeological residues
(Table D.2).

281
It was determined that levels of medium chain fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0 and
C15:0), C18:0 and C18:1 isomers in the sample could be used to distinguish degraded
experimental cooking residues (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). These fatty acids
are suitable for the identification criteria because saturated fatty acids are stable and the
mono-unsaturated fatty acid degrades very slowly, as compared to polyunsaturated fatty
acids (deMan 1992). Higher levels of medium chain fatty acids, combined with low
levels of C18:0 and C18:1 isomers, were detected in the decomposed experimental
residues of plants, such as roots, greens and most berries. High levels of C18:0 indicated
the presence of large herbivores. Moderate levels of C18:1 isomers, with low levels of
C18:0, indicated the presence of either fish or foods similar in composition to corn. High
levels of C18:1 isomers with low levels of C18:0, were found in residues of beaver or
foods of similar fatty acid composition. The criteria for identifying six types of residues
were established experimentally; the seventh type, plant with large herbivore, was
inferred (Table D.2). These criteria were applied to residues extracted from more than
200 pottery cooking vessels from 18 Western Canadian sites (Malainey 1997; Malainey
et al. 1999c; 2001b). The identifications were found to be consistent with the evidence
from faunal and tool assemblages for each site.
Work has continued to understand the decomposition patterns of various foods
and food combinations (Malainey et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2001a; Quigg et al. 2001).
The collection of modern foods has expanded to include plants from the Southern Plains.
The fatty acid compositions of mesquite beans (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas ebony seeds
(Pithecellobium ebano Berlandier), tasajillo berry (Opuntia leptocaulis), prickly pear
fruit and pads (Opuntia engelmannii), Spanish dagger pods (Yucca treculeana), cooked
sotol (Dasylirion wheeler), agave (Agave lechuguilla), cholla (Opuntia imbricata), piÃ±on
(Pinus edulis) and Texas mountain laurel (or mescal) seed (Sophora secundiflora) have
been determined. Experimental residues of many of these plants, alone or in combination
with deer meat, have been prepared by boiling foods in clay cylinders or using sandstone
for either stone boiling (Quigg et al. 2000) or as a griddle. In order to accelerate the

282
processes of oxidative degradation that naturally occur at a slow rate with the passage
of time, the rock or clay tile containing the experimental residue was placed in an oven at
75Â°C. After either 30 or 68 days, residues were extracted and analysed using gas
chromatography.
The results of these decomposition studies enabled refinement of the
identification criteria.

Methodology
Descriptions of the samples are presented in Table D.3. Exterior surfaces were
removed by grinding off exterior surfaces with a DremelÂ® tool fitted with a silicon
carbide bit. Immediately thereafter, the sample was crushed with a hammer mortar and
pestle and the powder transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask. Lipids were extracted using a
variation of the method developed by Folch et al. (1957). The powdered sample was
mixed with a 2:1 mixture, by volume, of chloroform and methanol (2 X 30 mL) using
ultrasonication (2 X 10 min). Solids were removed by filtering the solvent mixture into a
separatory funnel. The lipid/solvent filtrate was washed with 16 mL of ultrapure water.
Once separation into two phases was complete, the lower chloroform-lipid phase was
transferred to a round-bottomed flask and the chloroform removed by rotary evaporation.
Any remaining water was removed by evaporation with benzene (1.5 mL); 1.5 mL of
chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) was used to transfer the dry total lipid extract to a screwtop glass vial with a TeflonÂ®-lined cap. The sample was flushed with nitrogen and stored
in a -20Â°C freezer.
A 400 Î¼L sample of the total lipid extract solution was placed in a screw-top test
tube and dried in a heating block under nitrogen. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were
prepared by treating the dry lipid with 5 mL of 0.5 N anhydrous hydrochloric acid in
methanol (68oC; 60 min). Fatty acids that occur in the sample as di- or triglycerides are
detached from the glycerol molecule and converted to methyl esters. After cooling to
room temperature, 3.5 mL of ultrapure water was added. FAMES were recovered with

283
petroleum ether (2.5 mL) and transferred to a vial. The solvent was removed by heat
under a gentle stream of nitrogen; the FAMES were dissolved in 75 ÂµL of iso-octane
then transferred to a GC vial with a conical glass insert. Because the FAME
concentration was so high, it was necessary to dilute residue WSH 9 in 1 mL iso-octane
in order to obtain a suitable chromatogram.
Solvents and chemicals were checked for purity by running a sample blank. The
entire lipid extraction and methyl esterification process was performed and FAMES were
dissolved in 75 Î¼L of iso-octane. Traces of contamination were subtracted from sample
chromatograms. The relative percentage composition was calculated by dividing the
integrated peak area of each fatty acid by the total area of fatty acids present in the
sample.
The step in the extraction procedure where the chloroform, methanol and lipid
mixture is washed with water is standard procedure for the extraction of lipids from
modern samples. Following Evershed et al. (1990), who reported that this step was
unnecessary for the analysis of archaeological residues, previously the solvent-lipid
mixture was not washed. This step was recently adopted to remove impurities so that
clearer chromatograms could be obtained in the region where very long chain fatty acids
(C20:0, C20:1, C22:0 and C24:0) occur. It was anticipated that the detection and accurate
assessment of these fatty acids could be instrumental in separating residues of animal
origin from those of plant (Malainey et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2001a).
In order to identify the residue, the relative percentage composition was
determined first with respect to all fatty acids present in the sample (including very long
chain fatty acids) (see Table D.4) and secondly with respect to the ten fatty acids utilized
in the development of the identification criteria (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1,
C17:0, C18:0, C18:1w9, C18:1w11 and C18:2) (not shown). The second step is
necessary for the application of the identification criteria presented in Table D.2.
It must be understood that the identifications given do not necessarily mean that
those particular foods were actually prepared because different foods of similar fatty acid

284
composition and lipid content would produce similar residues. It is possible only to
say that the material of origin for the residue was similar in composition to the food(s)
indicated.

Gas Chromatography Analysis Parameters
The GC analysis was performed on a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph fitted with
a flame ionization detector connected to a personal computer. Samples were separated
using a DB-23 fused silica capillary column (30 m X 0.25 mm I.D.; J&W Scientific;
Folsom, CA). An autosampler injected a 1 Î¼L sample using a split/splitless injection
system. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas with a column flow of 1.0 mL/min.
Column temperature was held at 80 oC for 1 minute then increased to 140 oC at a rate of
20 oC per minute. It was then programmed from 140 to 230oC at 4oC per minute. The
upper temperature was held for 5 minutes. Chromatogram peaks were integrated using
Varian MS WorkstationÂ® software and identified through comparisons with external
qualitative standards (NuCheck Prep; Elysian, MN).

Results of Archaeological Data Analysis
The fatty acid compositions of nineteen residues are presented in Table D.4. Four
residues, WSH 5, WSH 6, WSH 19 and WSH 20, contained insufficient fatty acids for
analysis. The term, Area, represents the area under the chromatographic peak of a given
fatty acid, as calculated by the Varian MS Workstation Â® software minus the solvent
blank. The term, Rel%, represents the relative percentage of the fatty acid with respect to
the total fatty acids in the sample. Hydroxide or peroxide degradation products can
interfere with the integration of the C22:0 and C22:1 peaks; these fatty acids were
excluded from the analysis.
A total of six residues, WSH 8, WSH 9, WSH 18, WSH 22, WSH 23 and WSH
25, appear to reflect the preparation of low fat content plants. These residues are
characterized by elevated levels of medium chain fatty acids and relatively low levels of

285
C18:0 and C18:1 isomers. Foods known to produce similar residues include plant
greens, roots, certain berries and low fat starchy seeds. The lipid recoveries from WSH 9,
WSH 23 and WSH 25 were very high, which may suggest the vessels were intensely
used.
Five other residues, WSH 3, WSH 4, WSH 7, WSH 15 and WSH 16, appear to
reflect the preparation of medium-low fat content plants. These residues are similar to
those described above except that the level of C18:1 isomers is slightly higher. Foods
known to produce similar residues include prickly pear tunas and Spanish Dagger pods.
Medium fat content foods appear to occur in six residues. A variety of plant and
animal foods are known to produce these residues including mesquite beans, corn, cholla,
freshwater fish, terrapin, Rabdotus snail and fat-depleted elk. The decomposed cooking
residues of these foods are characterized by slightly elevated levels of C18:1 isomers and
relatively low levels of C18:0. Amounts of medium chain fatty acids are very high in five
of these residues, WSH 10, WSH 11, WSH 12, WSH 14 and WSH 21, which suggests
that the medium fat content foods were prepared in combination with low fat content
plants. Residue WSH 13 likely reflects the preparation of a medium fat content food
alone.
Three samples, WSH 2, WSH 17 and WSH 24 have elevated levels of C18:0,
which occurs in residues produced from large herbivore meat. Bison, deer and moose are
examples of large herbivores that produce similar residues. Other foods known to
produce similar residues include javelina meat and the seed oils of certain tropical plants,
such as sotol.
One sample, WSH 1, has elevated levels of both C18:0 and medium chain fatty
acids. This residue most likely reflects a combination of low fat content plants and large
herbivore meat.
One sample, WSH 26, has high levels of C18:1 isomers and low levels of C18:0.
The most probable source of this residue is locally available high fat content seeds and
nuts. The rendered fat of animals is very similar in fatty acid composition. Levels of
medium chain fatty acids of about 10% slightly favor a plant origin for this residue.

VITA
Larkin Hood was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. She received her Bachelor of Arts
in English Language and Literature from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She
earned a Master of Arts in Anthropology at the University of Washington in 1998, and
a Doctor of Philosophy in Anthropology in 2007. Her research interests include
hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence, ceramic archaeometry, the social and
economic contexts of pottery production and use, and the archaeology of the American
Southeast. Larkin began her archaeological career in the Chihuahuan Desert in 1991,
and has since participated in academic and private contract work in the north-central,
eastern, coastal, and southern portions of Texas, as well as projects in the San Juan
Islands and western Washington.
Larkin has been involved in numerous community outreach projects, from
visits to K-12 classrooms to the design and implementation of outreach programs in
archaeological education for all ages. She has presented her research to the citizens of
Texas and Washington. In both her classroom and informal teaching, she emphasizes
the connections of archaeology to modern communities and to liberal arts education.
