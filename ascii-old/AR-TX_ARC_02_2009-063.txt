ABSTRACT
The Millersview-Doole Water Supply Corporation (Millersview-Doole
WSC) intends to construct approximately 139 miles of 2” to 8” waterlines
and a tank to upgrade their system in Tom Green, Conch, Runnels, and
McCulloch counties, Texas. These routes are in a variety of settings,
which include the bluffs and terraces overlooking the Colorado and
Concho Rivers and the O.H. Ivie Reservoir, the level uplands between
these two watersheds, and occasionally the creek and stream valleys of the
intermittent drainages that flow into these rivers. AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted the study in three phases, and after an initial survey of 23.5
miles of waterline, recommended that the routes in the high potential areas
near drainages be surveyed, while the routes in low potential areas in the
uplands be investigated for standing structures or cemeteries, but not
intensively surveyed.
The investigations resulted in the recording three prehistoric (41CC329,
41TG621 and 41TG622) sites and one historic (41RN243) site. The
portions of 41TG621 and 41TG622 within the currently proposed 30’
right-of-way and the Area of Potential Effect (APE) in Sections 47 and 55
are not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Their status outside the
30’ area of proposed ROW is unknown. Site 41CC329 south of Section 30
is outside of the APE and requires no further investigation. The majority
of the historic site, 41RN243, is outside of the ROW, and should be
avoided. The southern end of Section 30 must be rerouted onto the east
side of the road for approximately 0.25 miles to avoid an unmarked grave
on the west side of County Road 1445.
Based on these results of this study, ARC recommends that no further
investigations are warranted and that the Millersview-Doole WSC can
proceed with their project. If buried cultural resources are discovered
during the installation of the lines, ARC recommends that work stop in the
immediate area and the THC be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The Millersview-Doole Water Supply Corporation (Millersview-Doole WSC) intends to
construct approximately 139 miles of 2” to 8” waterlines and a tank to upgrade their
system in Tom Green, Conch, Runnels, and McCulloch counties, Texas (Figure 1).
Although the study area spans four counties, this study was confined to the proposed
waterlines routes that are located in various settings. These settings include the bluffs and
terraces overlooking the Colorado and Concho Rivers and the O.H. Ivie Reservoir, the
level uplands between these two watersheds, and the occasional creek crossing in stream
valleys of intermittent drainages that flow into the aforementioned rivers.
The temporary easement is 30’ wide and the permanent easement is 15’ wide with the
maximum depth of installation of 36” below surface. Jacob & Martin, Ltd. of Abilene,
Texas contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an archaeological survey
of the waterline routes. ARC arbitrarily numbered these routes (Sections 1-24, 26-77 and
79-85) for the purpose of this study. The high potential areas, as well as the initial 23.5
miles of waterlines were surveyed, and the remaining waterlines were driven as they were
considered to be in low potential areas. The high potential areas for prehistoric sites were
waterline routes located near the Concho River where development has not obscured the
landscape, along the terraces of the river, or the tributaries of the Concho or Colorado
Rivers with floodplain soils. For historic sites, high potential areas were in alignments
near rural communities adjacent to transportation routes. ARC recommended, and the
Texas Historical Commission concurred in a letter dated November 25, 2009, that the
routes in low potential areas be investigated for standing structures or cemeteries, but not
intensively surveyed.
The purpose of the investigation was to identify any cultural resources present within the
study area and to make recommendations about their significance and how they may be
impacted by the installation of the waterlines or tank. The cultural resources investigation
was required because the Millersview-Doole WSC received funding for the system
improvements from the Texas Water Development Board, which is a political entity of
Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5435 was issued for the archaeological survey.
This report was written in accordance with the report guidelines adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area. This is followed by the cultural history portion of the
report. The research design and methodology follow, then the results of the field survey
are presented in the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude the text, and
lastly a list of references cited ends the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed waterline additions for the Millersview-Doole WSC are located in the
Rolling Plains physiographic region of Tom Green, Concho, Runnels, and McCulloch
counties in West Central Texas. From east to west, the terrain rises upwards from the
relatively level prairies of the Cross Timbers towards the uplift of the Edwards Plateau.
The majority of the study area falls in the uplands of the Colorado River Watershed.
Four sections of the proposed waterlines are in McCulloch County where the bedrock
consists of Quaternary surface deposits of gravel, caliche, sand and clay with pebbles,
cobbles and boulders of Cretaceous and Paleozoic limestone and chert (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1976a). Overlying topsoils are relatively shallow and include Karnes
loam, Mearta clay loam, upland clays in the Reap series, and Owens and Tarrant upland
clay (Bynum and Coker 1974:20-23, 27, 32, 38).
Several routes are located in Runnels County, and in the southern half, bedrock consists
of Quaternary caliche cemented gravel then towards the north end of the alignment,
bedrock consists of limestone and shale in the Grape Creek Formation (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1976a). Soils are in the Portales-Potter-Mereta and Rowena Tobesa
associations and are loamy soils over caliche on outwash plains (Weidenfeld, Barnhill
and Novosad 1970:2-3). The rest of the proposed waterlines traverse Concho and Tom
Green Counties where the bedrock consists of caliche flats intermittently broken up by
clay and silt playa deposits to the west and Quaternary deposits of boulders and cobbles
of limestone and chert and shale in the Wichita-Albany Group (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1976b).
Soils overlying the upland caliche flats are Angelo and Mearta clay loams on outwash
plains (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976:3). The topsoils range from 6 to 18 inches
respectively. Kimbrough gravelly loam soils are found along slopes of intermittent
drainage valleys with topsoils being approximately 9 inches thick (Wiedenfeld and Flores
1976:12). Soils overlying the limestone, chert and shale bedrock in Concho County are
Angelo Mereta loamy upland soils and Cho-Mereta-Nuvalde loamy, gravelly soils in the
uplands (Clower and Dowell 1988:6-7).
Alluvial deposits of floodplain soils are found along the Concho and Colorado Rivers and
are mapped in a few of the larger tributaries that drain into these rivers, such as Bluff
Creek, Kickapoo Creek and Crows Nest Creek. The soils in these drainages are mapped
as Rioconcho and Spur or Frio soils. Fluviate terrace deposits are located on the north
side of the Concho River and terrace soils are mapped near portions of the Colorado
River (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976b). Soils in the terrace deposits are mapped as
calcareous and noncalcareous Angelo, Estacado and Kimbrough soils on outwash plains
(Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976:5-7, 11, 12-13). Smaller tributaries in the region may have
once been spring fed include Crows Nest Creek and the Middle Concho River, but
intensive land use and the lowering of the water table has contributed to the drying of
many of these springs.

The climate of the Rolling Plains is considered subtropical with extreme seasonal
temperature fluctuations and the average rainfall in the study area being less than 24”
annually (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976:55). The degraded environment and limited
amount of surface water in the region is attributed to 19th and 20th century land use which
has adversely impacted the topsoil, nearly eradicated the prairie grasses, and has fostered
invasive species such as cedar, mesquite and prickly pear cactus which have depleted the
sparse water sources available. Historically, large and small mammals would have
included bison, antelope, wolves, coyotes and prairie dogs, yet more recently the
predominant wildlife includes deer, beaver, fox, weasels, raccoon, skunks and a variety
of birds, fish and reptiles.

CULTURE HISTORY
A well-defined cultural chronology for Tom Green, Concho, Runnels, and McCulloch
counties have not been developed as few archaeological investigations have been
conducted in this area of the Rolling Plains. The intensive surveys in the region were
centered around the O.H. Ivie Reservoir on the Colorado River (Trierweiler and Kuhl
1993), and provide specific data for cultural resources in the Colorado River Watershed.
The routes cover a broader area in the Rolling Plains of Texas which fall into the larger
Southern Great Plains region in the southwest, a general cultural chronology developed
of the Southern Great Plains is synthesized below. The major prehistoric cultural stages
are the Paleoindian, the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric and the Historic which are defined
by environmental, technological and social changes that had occurred.
The earliest evidence of human occupation in Texas is in the Paleoindian period (11,500
– 5500 BC) yet the cultural material is sparse (Hofman 1989:25). A survey of recorded
Paleoindian points was conducted in the 1990s and in 2005 to identify the number of
distinctive fluted Clovis points in Texas counties. Clovis points have been recorded in the
study area and these include: Concho (1), Runnels (3), Tom Green (2) and none in
McCulloch County (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-70). The Paleoindian period falls within
the Pleistocene epoch, in which climate and vegetation were markedly different than the
later Holocene, with a cooler and wetter climate than the present day (Hughes 1991:8-9;
Mallouf 1989:83). There are primarily three site types for this period: big-game kill sites,
habitation areas referred to as campsites, which were used also for lithic production,
butchering or processing station sites, and lithic procurement or quarry sites (Hughes and
Willey 1978; Boyd 1989; Mallouf 1989:81).
The Archaic is typically divided into the Early, Middle and Late periods (Hofman
1989:45). Major climatic shifts occurred, eventually settling into a warmer and drier
environment similar to the modern one, with an increase in grasslands and a reduction of
forests. Site types that occur during this time period are similar to those in the Prehistoric
such as bison kill sites and campsites. During the Early Archaic period (5500 – 3000
BC), hunting for small game became the major form of subsistence which is evidenced
by a shift in lithics styles (Hughes 1991:15). Although bison kill sites date to the Archaic
(Hofman 1989:45), the large, stemless lance points of the Paleoindian period were
replaced with lithics such as stemmed dart points, and grinding implements such as
manos and hearth stones appear at this time. Evidence for long term occupation during
this period is scarce due to a long drought that may have caused the uplands to be
abandoned for more favorable settings near reliable water sources, and there are few
cultural resources to accurately describe occupation patterns in this time period (Hofman
1989). There are few sites that are clearly dated to the Middle Archaic (3000 – 1000 BC)
(Boyd 1989:39). The Late Archaic period (1000 BC – AD 200) is characterized by the
use of multiple types of dart points for hunting bison and other game (Hughes 1991:20).
Thousands of sites from the Late Archaic are found in the Southern Plains indicating a
dramatic population increase from the Middle Archaic, with the prominent site types
being open campsites that were near playa basins and along streams (Hughes 1991:21).

The Late Prehistoric period (AD 200 – 1700) is recognized as the period of transition
between hunter gather societies of the Archaic to the more settled villages of the Late
Prehistoric (Hughes and Willey 1978:28). In addition, there is an increase in occupation
of the region (Boyd 1989). The climate appears to have been moister with an increase in
reliance on deer and smaller mammals for subsistence (Hofman and Brooks 1989:61).
The introduction of the bow and arrow in the Late Prehistoric coincides with the
appearance of pottery and pit-houses on the Southern Plains (Hughes 1991:24).
Agricultural practices appear during this period, yet probably post date the appearance of
ceramics (Boyd 1989:44-45).
Spanish Explorers were the first Europeans to enter the region in the 16th century, and
were later followed by Euro American settlers in the mid 19th century. Until the late 19th
century, conflict was common between the Apache, Comanche and settlers. Following
the annexation of Texas, a series of forts were established, many were near the Concho
River, to stave off the Indian attacks on settlers in the region (Frazer 1965). Eventually
these conflicts ceased and the Native Americans were resettled into reservations in
present day Oklahoma. Tom Green County, Concho, Runnels and McCulloch counties
were established in the second half of the 19th century. The 1880s brought significant
change to the region with the development of large communities such as San Angelo and
Ballinger, and the advent of fencing with barbed wire. The loss of the “open range” due
to fencing and the arrival of the Santa Fe Railroad during the late 19th century changed
the way livestock were transported. The dominant industry in the region has remained
agricultural into the 20th century, with cattle, sheep, and goats as well as cotton, pecans
and poultry being significant to the economy (Texas History Online 2009).
Small towns in the region east of San Angelo include Wall, Mereta, Vancourt, Veribest
and Eola whose surrounding fields are dominated by cotton crops, and cotton co-op gins
are present in Wall, Vancourt and Mereta. Other towns such as Waldrip and Pear Valley
have all but vanished from the landscape. Several proposed waterline routes cross
through the small community of Mereta, Texas, 18 miles east of San Angelo, which is
between FM 1692 and Lipan Creek in the extreme east of Tom Green County. The town,
said to be named for twin sisters Meta and Reta Burns, had a gin, two stores, and a school
when the town plat was made in 1904 (Texas History Online 2009). The largest
population reported for Mereta was 75, which happened on a couple of occasions, with a
nadir of ten residents reported in 1934. Today the gin is still a central fixture in Mereta,
with a few small businesses, homes, and a church making up the rest of the town.
Previous Investigations
The counties in the Millersview-Doole WSC service area have not had extensive
archaeological work outside of the O.H. Ivie Reservoir studies in Concho, Coleman and
Runnels counties. The earliest investigations in were in 1919 where J. E. Pearce of the
University of Texas excavated burned rock middens. No other work was done until 1933
when a historic contact burial was excavated by a high school biology class in the Brady
Mountains. Two more burials were excavated near Salt Gap by A. M. Woolsey (1936).
Investigations were conducted at the Twin Butts Reservoir beginning in 1946 and

continuing for more than a decade (Stephenson 1949; Willis 1958; Green 1961). A small
area along the South Concho River was surveyed to correlate archaeological remains with
micro environmental zones (Creel 1978:241). These investigations determined that
occupation and food procurement activities occurred in riparian zones, while the flatlands
and outwash plains were used for used for procurement of food resources, and the
uplands were used for procurement of lithic resources. In the 1970s and 1980s the Soil
Conservation Service had surveys conducted prior to the construction of floodwater
retarding structures along generally intermittent tributaries of the Colorado and Concho
rivers (Bruseth 1975; Green 1974; Prewitt and Filson 1978; Skinner and Mahoney 1974;
Warren 1977; and Skinner and Bousman 1985).
The intensive studies conducted before the construction of O.H. Ivie Reservoir, which
was originally named the Stacey Reservoir. The reservoir is located at the confluence of
the Concho and Colorado rivers in Concho, Coleman and Runnels counties. These studies
included large area surveys of the floodplain and terraces as well as testing and
excavation of selected sites. The comprehensive studies have provided substantial data on
occupational and burial patterns for the region. Site types ranged from burned rock
middens, hearths, cairn burials, to possible tipi-rings and were concentrated on the
fluviate terraces above the river floodplain (Trierweiler and Kuhl 1993:15-17). Historic
sites recorded included homesteads, dugouts, a cairn, and multiple ranches (Earls, Lintz,
Trierweiler, O’Neill and Scurlock 1993:56-59). Nineteenth and early 20th century historic
homesteads, dugouts and ranch houses have been recorded on the bluffs and terraces less
than a mile from the Concho and Colorado rivers, while historic farmsteads were
recorded in the uplands away from the rivers but near larger drainages such as Grape and
Elm creeks.
Subsequent cultural resource investigations in this region have been limited to linear
studies for pipeline, transmission line, and highways (Turpin, Bement and Robinson
1992; Shortes, McMurtie, Sherman, Sills and Victor 2004) or studies concentrated on
drainage valleys by the Texas Water Development Board. Results from these
investigations have identified prehistoric sites such as lithic scatters, quarries, campsites,
and burned rock middens, while historic sites types are typically homesteads, farmsteads,
industrial architectural remains, artifact scatters or cemeteries. Prehistoric sites are
concentrated along the drainages and site densities dropped dramatically in the uplands in
this arid region.
In the last decade, ARC has conducted several studies for the Millersview-Doole WSC in
Tom Green, Concho, Runnels and McCulloch counties (Trask 2002; Trask 2003; Todd
2005). In 2002, ARC conducted an evaluation of approximately 200 miles of waterlines
and recommended that waterline routes that fell into high potential areas, specifically at
drainage crossings and bluff tops be surveyed (Trask 2002). The THC concurred with the
assessments of archaeological potential for the region, and in 2003 and 2005, ARC
conducted surveys of the high potential areas. During the 2003 investigations, only one
site, the N. Arrington Road site (41TG576) was recorded in the uplands south of the
Concho River. The site consisted of a surface scatter of chert lithic debris. No diagnostic
tools or ground stone tools were located, and it was classified as a lithic procurement site.

Combined data from these studies demonstrated that there is lower potential for cultural
resources, both prehistoric and historic, in upland settings away from drainages with
higher densities along the Colorado and Concho rivers and their major drainages. Lithic
procurement or production sites in the uplands are most likely disturbed in the deflated
environment, especially in areas of plowed fields.
The work at the reservoir demonstrates that prehistoric people utilized the resources
within floodplains and along major waterways. Surveys in the uplands, or areas away
from these larger drainages, found a lower density of sites in various settings. Burials
have been found on the bluff tops and sites at lower elevations include burned rock
middens and lithic procurement areas.
Previously recorded cultural resources that are located within a 1/2 mile of the proposed
waterline alignments are presented below by from east to west by USGS Quad.
Information regarding site types is primarily drawn from the Texas Archeological Site
Atlas (TASA 2009) and the O.H. Ivie Reservoir studies. Descriptions of the sites are
presented along with site proximity to specific waterline sections.
In the Doole Quad located in northwest McCulloch County Section 44 parallels FM 503
on the east side. The Stacy Cemetery is on the west side of FM 503, approximately 180
feet west of the proposed waterline route. Over 400 burials are within Stacey Cemetery,
the oldest marked burial is dated 1814.
Beginning at FM 765, Section 83 begins on the east, then south and terminates on the
east side of Waldred Road in the Fife Quad. The majority of the route crosses through
pastures adjacent to the roadway easement. North of the town of Waldrip, the route enters
the Colorado River Watershed. The Chaffin Cemetery is approximately 3000’ to the east
of the proposed alignment, while a single grave is recorded 1/2 mile to the north of the
alignment near the Colorado River.
Section 84 parallels the easement on the north side of FM 765 in the Whon Quad. The
majority of the route overlaps a linear survey conducted by the Texas Department of
Transportation for the construction of FM 765. Two prehistoric sites (41MK27 and
41MK10) were recorded on the edge of Bluff Creek in the roadway alignment
approximately 150 feet from the proposed alignment, and possibly were destroyed during
construction.
Historical Marker (5162) records the location of the Sweet Home School on the west side
of Old Sweet Home School Road (CR 252) southwest of the town of Rowena in the
Leaday Quad. The school was active at this location from 1922 to 1944, and all that
remains is a cellar. Section 28 of the waterline is on the east side of the road, and
installation of the line will not impact the cellar to the school. The TASA site forms notes
that the marker was reported missing in April 2009.
Sections 34-43, are located in Concho County near the O.H. Ivie Reservoir in the Leaday
Quad. The majority of these routes overlap areas already surveyed for the reservoir

studies (Trierweiler and Kuhl 1993; Earls, Lintz, Trierweiler, O’Neill and Scurlock
1993). East of Sections 39-43, a series of six sites (41CC47, 41CC 55-56, 41CC78,
41CC80 and 41CC 97) were recorded along Gattling Creek (as spelled on the USGS
map). Section 41 is the closest to these sites, being .47 miles to the west. Site 41CC47
burned rock surface scatter that had been disturbed mechanical excavation. Site 41CC55
(The Gatlin House) was on a small knoll overlooking the spring fed creek, and contains
both prehistoric and historic components. Site 41CC56 is an open occupation area
overlooking the creeks with mano fragments, burned rock, lithic debris and one Montell
projectile point. 41CC78 is the remains of a homestead contained foundation stones, a
well, and a cellar. Another historic site recorded along Gattling Creek is 41CC80, which
is a stone wall, possibly the remains of a corral. Finally, site 41CC97 is a multicomponent
site with cut limestone blocks and lithic debris. Only one site, the historic component of
site 41CC55, was tested for eligibility to the NRHP, and no further investigations were
recommended. These sites ultimately were inundated by the construction of the reservoir.
North of Sections 34-37, three prehistoric sites (41CC147, 41CC154, and 41CC157) are
located near O.H. Ivie Reservoir. Site 41CC154 is a deflated lithic scatter, while the two
others appear to be campsites of moderate intensity. Again, the reservoir survey overlaps
the project area and no sites were recorded where the waterline alignments are located.
In the Veribest and Wall Quads, Sections 2 through 4 are in the town of Wall on the
north side of Old Highway 87, now Texas Loop 570. Wall Cemetery is located
approximately 1/2 mile from these sections 2 and 4, and further from Section 3. Wall
Cemetery was established in 1906 when Mr. and Mrs. M.F. Elliot sold 3.7 acres of land
to the Lipan Cemetery Association (Tom Green County Historical Preservation League
2003:181). A chain link fence encloses the marked graves, and gravestones are along the
north and west fence lines. Over 250 burials are marked, with archival records noting
there are at least 3 unmarked burials. The earliest recorded graves are dated 1901.
Immediately to the west of Wall Cemetery is a second cemetery at the intersection of
Hawk Road and Texas Loop 570, the St. Ambrose Cemetery. This cemetery was
dedicated in 1952 and it is where the deceased parishioners of the St. Ambrose Catholic
Church are buried. It is also over ½ mile away from the proposed waterlines.
Eleven sites are recorded within a ½ mile east and northeast of Section 18 in the Leaday
and Concho Quads. Section 18 overlaps areas previously surveyed during the 1980
reservoir study and no previously recorded sites are within the proposed waterline
alignment. Eight of these sites are prehistoric (41CC148-152, 41CC183, and 41CC185186), representing lithic procurement areas or small, temporary camps. Two historic sites
were also recorded (41CC181 and 41CC184). Of these sites, one was tested for
eligibility; the multi-component site (41CC187). 41CC187 was discovered on two knolls
composed of alluvium typical of Quaternary terraces. The artifacts recorded included 311
lithics, some of which were recognizable tools, but none were temporally diagnostic. The
assemblage was consistent with lithic procurement and initial production.
Section 30 parallels CR 1445 on the west side in the Eola and Millersview NW Quads.
The route will cross to the east side for approximately .25 miles to avoid the unknown

grave recorded on the west side of the road. The grave is shown on the Millersview NW,
TX 7.5’ USGS map. The route then turns west to parallel the road and crosses Kickapoo
Creek on the north side of the road. Prehistoric sites have been recorded along this
drainage, yet their locations are over one mile to the north and south of the alignment.
Sections 21 and 22 are located in residential neighborhoods on the south side of the
Concho River in the Veribest Quad. Three recorded sites (41TG307, 41TG308,
41TG309) are on the north side of the Concho River and are within a ½ mile from
Section 21. Site 41TG307 is a large open occupation site on an alluvial terrace deposit of
the Concho River. Burned rock, mussel shell and chert flakes are present at this Early
Archaic site (Quigg, Peck, Lintz, Treece, Frederick, Clem and Ell 1998). The site was
recommended as eligible as a State Archeological Landmark. Site 41TG307 was
contiguous to and on the same alluvial terrace of site 41TG309, which is just to the north.
Also recommended as an SAL, 41TG309 dates to the Early Archaic, Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods and continued rock lined hearths and mussel shell lenses. Lithic
debris, mussel shell and burned rock were visible on the surface. Site 41TG308 is a lithic
procurement site on a bluff above the Concho River. Prehistoric and historic artifacts
were on the surface, as well as bedrock mortars were identified. Further testing was
recommended to determine eligibility for the NRHP.
Five other sites (41TG202, 41TG282, 41TG283, 41TG305, and 41TG306) recorded
along the Concho are less than ½ mile from Section 22. Site 41TG202, on the south side,
contained seven bedrock mortars near a spring that flowed into the Concho River, yet the
Concho Valley Archeology Society who recorded the site in 1982 recommended no
further testing. Additional testing was recommended after the initial survey for 41TG282,
a river terrace camp, 41TG283 a lithic procurement site, and for 41TG305 a terrace
campsite, all which are on the north or east side of the river near the bend. The final site
is 41TG306 on the west side of the river, and was described as an open occupation
campsite on a bluff.
In addition to the recorded cultural resources within 1/2 mile of the alignments, there are
structures mapped on the USGS maps within or adjacent to several of the waterline
routes. The USGS maps date between 1967 and 1984, therefore it is unknown if these
structures are more or less than fifty years old.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The combined data from the surveys performed in the region provide site distribution
patterns. From these patterns, we have identified areas of high and low potential for
cultural resources in the study area and these areas have been confirmed by the THC.
Two sets of research questions were developed to address the prehistoric and historic
archaeological potential.
The first question addresses the archaeological potential for finding prehistoric sites. The
majority of sites recorded in the region are close to rivers and their major tributaries on
fluviate terraces or in alluvial deposits. There is a high potential for locating larger, more
permanent campsites and lithic production sites near the Concho and Colorado rivers and
their major tributaries. These sites contain buried, stratified deposits with chipped stone
tools, hearths, ground stone tools, and possibly preserved faunal remains. Artifacts buried
at depths below the plow zone may contain intact cultural deposits. There is a lower
potential for finding ephemeral campsites near intermittent drainages that contained water
seasonally. These are most likely surface sites that would include burned rock middens,
lithic debris and chipped stone tools. Surface sites in the terrace gravel outcrops above
the Concho and Colorado rivers could include cores, flakes, and other lithic debris
associated with lithic procurement or production. In the uplands, there is potential for
finding burials on bluff tops and lithic production sites near chert outcrops. Artifact
manifestations in the lithic procurement sites would include cores, primary and secondary
flakes, bifaces, yet very few tools which would be typical for lithic procurement sites. It
is anticipated that areas where shallow topsoil is present has been heavily farmed since
the beginning of the 20th century, and that surface sites are likely to be heavily disturbed,
yet evidence of prehistoric occupation might appear as isolated artifacts within the
plowed fields. These upland settings are considered to have low potential for significant
prehistoric resources.
The second research question addresses the potential for finding historic sites. It is
anticipated that historic sites will be found along transportation routes throughout the area
or on the bluffs and terraces overlooking the Concho or Colorado rivers. There are
several mapped structures within or adjacent to the route on the USGS maps, with higher
densities centered around towns such as Mereta and Wall. Sites types might include
farmsteads, homesteads, cemeteries or artifact scatters. The proposed waterline routes
that are located in plowed fields, rocky pastures, or in narrow easements in existing
housing developments are considered to have low potential for containing significant
historic sites.
Therefore, high potential areas are those locations near the Concho River where
development has not obscured the landscape, and along the terraces of the river, or the
floodplain tributaries of the Concho or Colorado rivers. In addition, there is potential for
historic sites near rural communities and adjacent to transportation routes. Low potential

areas for both prehistoric and historic sites include the upland, level settings away from
drainages that are currently used for agricultural purposes.
Methodology
The survey and investigations of the waterline alignments was contracted in three stages,
and ARC conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the first 23.5 miles (Sections
1-49). Following the results of these and previous surveys, ARC recommended to the
THC that intensive survey be conducted in the high potential areas of the remaining
alignments, while the low potential routes be driven to identify any standing structures or
cemeteries that might be in the waterline ROW. Most of the proposed waterline routes
are on the boundary lines of private property and road easements of county or farm to
market roads. In these settings, the routes are within 30’ of the fence lines (where
present) or on the inside of the road easement to avoid impacting existing utility lines.
Shovel testing was conducted along the route as recommended by the Texas Historical
Commission (n.d). Compact clays from the shovel tests were manually broken and
inspected visually as were the pit walls. Loamy soils from the shovel tests were screened
through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel tests were concentrated on the upland edges above the
creek crossings and where ground visibility was less than 30 percent. The drainages will
be bored, and survey was concentrated at the drainage crossings to identify the presence,
and extent, of floodplain deposits. No trenching was recommended at the drainage
crossings during these investigations, as the floodplains, if present, were narrow and can
be avoided during the boring process.
Notes were made about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed
areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon
Elph 2.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests and trench locations were recorded with
a handheld Garmin GPSmap 76 receiver. Non-diagnostic artifacts were recorded,
sketched or photographed in the field but were not collected for curation.

RESULTS
The results section begins with description of the waterline routes surveyed, which are
presented by USGS Quad from east to west, beginning in McCulloch County, then
Concho, Runnels, and finally the routes in Tom Green County (Table 1). For each
waterline section surveyed, the terrain, ground visibility, and water sources present are
discussed as well as are the cultural resources within ½ mile of the proposed routes.
Overall, the routes are in upland settings. Following the survey results, the routes in the
low potential areas or areas heavily impacted by development are briefly described.
USGS maps showing the locations of each waterline route are referenced in the text and
presented in Appendix A and the detailed shovel tests descriptions are presented in
Appendix B. Conclusions end the chapter.
Vegetation varied throughout the waterline routes, but the primary land use was for crops
and pastures (Figure 2), with the occasional route following unimproved pastures
containing mesquite, prickly pear, agarita and pencil cactus or prairie grass. Most of the
proposed waterline routes are on the boundary lines of private property and road
easements of county or farm to market roads. In these settings, the routes are within 15’
of the fence lines (where present) on private property away from the road easement to
avoid impacting existing utility lines.

Pedestrian Survey of Waterline Routes
Whon Quad
Section 84 parallels FM 765 and an existing utility cable route for approximately 6.25
miles (Appendix A: Figure 52). Three intermittent drainages are crossed from west to
east, Cow Creek, Bluff Creek and Cedar Creek. The terrain is hilly, with bedrock exposed
on the surface of the hilltops and gravels on the slopes. Ground visibility was excellent,
between 30 and 80 percent for the majority of the route, except for in the Bluff Creek
drainage valley, which was overgrown with grasses, mesquites and cedars. Cow Creek
and Cedar Creek had exposed bedrock and gravels in the channels.
The route parallels a previous study conducted in the 1970s immediately to the south that
was conducted by the State Department of Highway and Public Transportation (now
TxDOT) for the construction of FM 765. Two sites (41MK10 and 41MK27) were
recorded within the Bluff Creek valley approximately 150 feet from the proposed
waterline route, yet no evidence of these sites being present within the route was
identified during the survey and shovel testing. Approximately one km of each side of the
Bluff Creek crossing was surveyed, and four shovel tests were placed in the Bluff Creek
valley to determine the extent of the floodplain and if buried cultural deposits were
present. Shovel test MD1 was placed 140 m southwest from the channel and the upper
loamy clay encountered compact gravel bedrock at 58 cmbs. Two subsequent shovel tests
(MD7 and B1) were placed closer to the drainage, 60 and 30 m respectively. Both shovel
tests encountered laminated clay loams to depths of 95 and 72 cm respectively with the
bottom 20 cm having 10-20 percent of CaCo3 filaments. Three mussel shells were
located between 20 and 30 cmbs in B1 in the clay loam, but above the compact clay. No

lithics, fire cracked rock (FCR) or charcoal were associated with the shell, and due to
their shallow depth in the soil, we conclude that they were naturally occurring. Shovel
test MD8 was placed on the northeast bank on a level area above the drainage slope,
approximately 30 m from the bank. A compact gravel layer representing the upper layer
of the bedrock was encountered at 75 cmbs.
Bluff Creek is mapped as having Frio clay loam soil in well drained bottom lands. The
drainage is nestled between two prominent hills of gravel and limestone bedrock (Figure
3). The channel is approximately 15 meters wide with steep slopes. The west bank is
higher than the east, approximately 3 m of soil overlies 60 cm of gravel which rests on
blocky, limestone bedrock. The east bank has a gentler slope and is lower with
approximately 2 m of soil overlying the gravel and limestone bedrock. Based on the
results of the survey and the shovel testing, it appears that the floodplain is wider to the
west (over 200 m) before the steep ascent of the hill, and narrower to the east
(approximately 90 m). No cultural resources were encountered during the survey or in the
shovel tests, nor identified in the creek banks.

Fife Quad
Section 83 is approximately 5.52 miles in length and starting at the northern end, it
begins on the east side, then crosses to the south side to terminate on the east side of
Waldred Road just north of FM 765 in cultivated cotton fields (Appendix A: Figure 51).
The north half of the route crosses through pastures adjacent to the roadway easement.
The waterline parallels the narrow roadway easement (between 2 and 5 m) that also
contains telephone corridors. North of the abandoned town of Waldrip the route enters
the the Owens Krum rolling uplands between high terraces. Ground visibility was
excellent along the route, and between 30 and 50 percent in the pastures north of
Waldrip. A modern ranch house is now present at the towns location. Terrace gravels
interspersed with foot long limestone rock underlaid shallow loam soils. Chert gravels
were present, yet only one flake and a tested cobble were identified on the northernmost
section of the route. No other artifacts were identified, and these two were determined to
be isolated artifacts.
Lohn and Salt Gap Quad
Section 19 parallels the east then the north side of CR 356 for approximately 1.32 miles
and begins in the Lohn Quad (Appendix A: Figure 12). The route was driven and sections
of the route were visually inspected every 100 m and near the drainage crossing. The
terrain was rolling, with steep slopes on either side of the intermittent headwater to Little
Saddle Creek in the northeast section of the route. Ground visibility was between 50 and
80 percent along the route and a two-track route follows the fence line. The land is
primarily used for pasture, and there were large push piles of limestone, chert cobbles and
mesquite near the fence line. Northwest of the drainage, a large stock tank had been
excavated. A structure mapped on the Lohn, TX 7.5’ USGS topographic map was present
northeast of the water route, yet it is out of the ROW. No cultural material was identified
on the surface, and this was not surprising, as the clay topsoil was very thin overlying
cemented bedrock (Figure 4).
Paint Rock Quad
Section 17 is located near the southern boundary of Runnels County on the north side of
CR 234 (Appendix A: Figure 10). From east to west, the .96 mile route crosses through
relatively level upland pastures with a small stand of mesquite trees near the center of the
route. Ground visibility was excellent, between 80 and 90 percent and exposed the clay
loam topsoil, and although there was limestone on the surface, there were no chert
nodules or cultural material on the surface.

Millersview NW Quad
Section 30 begins at the intersection of CR 1445 and FM 765 on the west side (Appendix
A: Figure 18). During archival research, references to an unknown grave on the west side
of CR 1445 was located. The grave is shown on the Millersview NW, TX 7.5’ USGS
map near an east-west property fence line approximately 225 feet from the road edge.
Although the majority of this section crosses through pastures and fields, two areas were
recommended for survey; where the route paralleled the grave location, and the Kickapoo
Creek crossing. The route parallels CR 1445 within 30 feet inside the fenceline on the
west side through pastures for approximately 5.55 miles. The route then parallels CR
1640 on the north side to the east for .63 miles and to the west for 2.01 miles where it
crosses Kickapoo Creek.
According to the location shown on the USGS map and conversations with the
landowner, Hansel Hoffman, the grave is located approximately one mile north of FM
765 and 224 feet west of CR 1445 between a fence line and a two track ranch road
(Hoffman, personal correspondence 2009). The boundary of the grave location once was
outlined with a wire fence, but Hoffman noted that the fence was removed when the
ranch road was established. The individual buried there had died of smallpox when
Hoffman’s parents owned the land in the first half of the 20th century, therefore he was
buried in this isolated location to prevent spread of the disease. No markers remain to
show the exact location of the grave, yet the narrative provided by Hoffman suggests the

location information shown on the USGS map is correct. The mapped location of the
grave is over 150 feet from the fence line that parallels CR 1445.
At the Kickapoo Creek crossing, portions of Section 30 were surveyed for approximately
1 km on either side of the drainage. The vegetation consisted of short grass pasture with
cedar and mesquite tree. Ground visibility was between 50 and 70 percent along the fence
row, as the route had been recently cleared of vegetation. Kickapoo Creek is mapped as
intermittent with Frio clay loam in the channel and silty clay loam terrace soils adjacent
to the channel. Shovel tests were placed on the level terraces, and the banks as well as the
erosional gullies were inspected for cultural materials. Shovel tests MD5 and MD6
encountered a compact gravel zone at 57 and 32 cmbs respectively, and this was
consistent with the bank profiles, which exhibited a 2 m thick gravel layer followed by
thick limestone bedrock (Figure 5). The soil was very shallow on the slopes as well, and
no floodplain soils are present at this crossing.

Figure 5.

Kickapoo Creek crossing in Section 30, view is to the northwest.

A hearth consisting of a single layer of fire-cracked rock was identified in a eroded gully
on the west side of the creek outside of the waterline ROW. The hearth was between 10
and 20 cm below the surface and was approximately 105 cm long (Figure 6). Recorded as
site 41CC329, the hearth is located on a small rise that once overlooked the creek, but
which has been destroyed by the road cut leading to the creek crossing (Figure 7). No
chipped stone artifacts or charcoal was found on the surface or in the eroded gully. The
site outside of the waterline ROW, and will not be impacted by installation yet it was
recorded since it is in the road easement between the ROW and road and is in danger of
eroding out of the gully.

Section 77 is approximately 1.36 miles long and parallels the north side of FM 765
(Appendix A: Figure 48). The route crosses the intermittent Duck Creek. The road
easement is approximately 25 feet wide, and a deer fence defines the boundary between
the private property and the easement. The ground visibility on either side of the upland
drainage was 50 percent in the short grass pasture. A two track road is on the north side
of the fence, and slabs of limestone bedrock are on the surface. The drainage was more of
an upland draw and less than a meter deep. The remainder of the route crosses through
pastures. No cultural material was noted on either side of the creek.
Rowena Quad
Section 63 begins at the intersection of CR 347 and FM 2872 (Appendix A: Figure 35).
The line will be constructed along the west side of the north-running CR 347 for 1.64
miles. The majority of the area is plowed fields with 90 percent ground visibility. A
narrow area of improved pasture is maintained around the Indian Creek crossing, which
traverses the route in an approximately west to east direction. Ground visibility in the
pasture area was 30 to 100 percent in the bottom of a dry tank. Limestone gravel was
visible on the surface and only a few pieces of pieces poor quality chert were noted. The
drainage channel was approximately 1.5 meters wide and 30 cm deep. Shovel test 005
was placed on 10 m north of the creek and encountered upland clay. No cultural
materials or chert was found in the shovel test. No shovel test was placed on the south
side of the crossing as it was heavily disturbed by the construction of a gravel pad for the
tank.
Section 67 is 1.33 miles long and begins at the intersection of FM 2133 and CR
401(Appendix A: Figure 39). The line parallels the northeast and east sides of CR 401 to
the southeast then turns south. The majority of the area is plowed, but a narrow strip of
improved pasture flanks Rocky Creek. Surface visibility in the fields was 50 to 80
percent and 30 to 60 percent in the improved pasture. Limestone gravel was visible on
the surface and in shovel tests, but no chert was encountered. The channel of Rocky
Creek is 2 meters wide and incised about 50 cm; no water was in the drainage at the time
of the survey. Two shovel tests were excavated at the creek crossing, one on the
northwest side (006), the other on the southeast side (007), both were 15 meters back
from the drainage crossing. Both confirmed the expectation of upland clay loam
presented by the soils map. No cultural materials were found in either shovel test.
Lowake Quad
Section 68 runs south southeast for 2.26 miles along a terrace between Deep Hollow and
Dry Hollow just south of the Concho River and ends at FM 765 (Appendix A: Figure 41).
The waterline route parallels a private road on the west side. The route was bisected by
multiple utility lines, and a cable line was paralleled the west side of the road. Soils are
mapped as shallow Cho gravelly loam, yet during the survey, it was noted that topsoil
was heavily eroded and caliche and eroded limestone were on the surface (Figure 8).
Ground visibility was between 50 and 70 percent, and no cultural resources were noted.

Section 11 is 1.25 miles long from north to south and parallels the west side of CR 363 in
southwestern Runnels County (Appendix A: Figure 7). The route is in a level, upland
setting and passes through a cotton field. Ground visibility was 100 percent, and nodular
chert was intermixed with the degraded bedrock in the loamy soils (Figure 9). Two
isolated artifacts were recorded in the waterline route, a unifacial scraper and a cobble
core approximately 30 meters apart. They were good quality chert. No other cultural
material was noted within the route, and these artifacts could have been discarded in
prehistory or brought in as part of the adjacent county road fill.
Section 47 is subdivided into three sections (a, b and c) which are north of the Concho
River near the town of Miles (Appendix A: Figure 25 for 47a, Figure 5 for 47b and c).
Portions of the route are in high potential areas are near the terraces of the Concho River
and at the crossing of an unnamed tributary to the river. The remainder of the route
crossed through low potential areas in the uplands along the edge of road easements to
South Douglas Loop, East Douglas Loop and Chandler Road.
Section 47a follows the south side of US 67 for a short distance before turning north to
parallel the west side of Northcross Road. The line runs almost entirely through cotton
fields with 90 percent ground visibility; limestone gravel was exposed on the surface, but
no chert was noted. A small section of line passed through improved pasture with 30 to
60 percent ground visibility and nothing was found.

Section 48 is 2.83 miles long and traces Chandler Road to the east, with a fork to the east
and a western fork which runs south of Twins Lane (Appendix A: Figure 26). Shovel
tests were placed on each side of an unnamed drainage to the Concho River where the
easternmost portion of the Section 48 alignment crosses. No cultural material was found
in ST 12 on the west bank, and bedrock was on the surface of the surrounding slopes.
During the survey of the eastern portion of the alignment, a prehistoric site (41TG622)
was recorded on the southeast side of Chandler Road on a bluff edge overlooking the
Concho River (Figure 10). Six shovel tests were placed within the original 30-foot ROW
where ground visibility was less than 30 percent, all contained cultural material (Table 2).
Based on the extent of the surface scatter, which was easily identified due to ground
visibility being over 50 percent to the north, east and west of the area shovel tested, it
appears that the site boundaries extended outside the waterline ROW and site boundaries
are north of the bluff edge. The site is approximately 110 m north-to-south and 60 m eastto-west (1.6 acres). No artifacts were located downslope from the bluff to the south and
west, and the buried cultural material appears to be contained in the soil deposit on the
north side of the limestone bluff.

location where buried concentrations of artifacts were recorded.

Artifacts on the surface and in the shovel tests included heat-treated chert cores, flakes,
broken bifaces, lithic debris and mussel shell, but only two pieces of fire cracked rock.
No charcoal was present (Appendix C). The site appears to be a campsite where lithic
production occurred. Artifact densities were highest in ST 14-16 where the soil was
deepest and much lower in ST 13, 17 and 18 where bedrock was encountered at 5 – 25
cmbs.

Based on the results of the shovel tests, it appeared that the topsoil was relatively shallow
on the bluff, except for the area between ST14 and ST16, where artifacts were buried up
to 95 cm in depth in ST15. After the initial survey, the waterline alignment was moved to
the west side of the road for several hundred feet to avoid impacting the front yard during
trenching.
Two trenches were placed within the water line ROW that continued on the south side of
the fence to determine if there were discrete features and to determine extent of the
topsoil on the limestone and caliche bluff. Trench A was placed near the western bluff
edge and was oriented east-west. Caliche and limestone bedrock were encountered
immediately below the surface and the trench was terminated. Trench B was placed 15 m
east of Trench A and was placed in the waterline ROW and overlapped with the bore
point location. The 6 m long trench was excavated to bedrock, which undulated and
varied in depths (Figure 11). The maximum depth of the trench was 110 cm. Two 20 cm
columns of trench wall were screened at 10 cm intervals at the 2 and 4 m marks from the
north wall. Artifacts similar to those from the shovel tests were found, such as heattreated chert and mussel shell, yet no fire-cracked rock or diagnostic artifacts were
located, nor were any features identified in the trench walls. Artifact density was
consistent between the screened columns, with artifacts distributed throughout the depth
of the deposit.

Trench B profile at site 41TG622.

The lithic production site is located in a narrow stretch of field adjacent to a residence,
and is bisected by the construction of Chandler Road (Figure 12). The artifact scatter
continued into the front yard of the residence to the northeast, where ground visibility
was excellent and there was little topsoil and caliche on the surface. The site contained no
distinct cultural stratigraphic layers, features or diagnostic artifacts. Based on these
factors, no further testing is recommended as the site does not appear to be eligible for
listing on the National Register for Historic Places.

Section 55 is .98 miles long and parallels the north side of the Concho River (Appendix
A: Figure 26). It begins at Chandler Road and ends just before Mullins Crossing Road to
the east. The route passes through three discrete areas, which are discussed from west to
east. They are the bluff top, residential tracts, and fields. The western 250 meters of the
line crosses through improved pasture on a bluff top with three small rises, much like the
one on which the Chandler Road site (41TG621) was found. Ground visibility in this
segment ranged from 10 to 90 percent. Lithics were found to be abundant on the surface
and the area was designated 41TG621 (Figure 13).

Figure 13.

Plan map of site 41TG621.

Lithic materials observed include two thin bifaces, several crude and thick bifaces, and
numerous flakes. No diagnostic artifacts were found. Four shovel tests were excavated
along the centerline with an effort to hit highpoints and the saddles between them where
sediments may have accumulated. Despite the excellent ground visibility, the shovel tests
were excavated to determine if there was any depth to the cultural deposits, while the site
boundary was recorded on the basis of surrounding topography and ground visibility,
which was well over 30 percent. Shovel test 25, on the western knoll of 41TG621, had
barely five cm of dark gray sandy loam topsoil before giving way to caliche indicating an
extremely deflated area. Several interior flakes were noted in the shovel test. Shovel test
26 was placed in a shallow saddle between the first and second knolls and had dark gray
sandy loam to 35 cm before hitting caliche. Artifacts were present on the surface at this

shovel test location, but none were found below the surface. Shovel test 27 was excavated
northeast of 26 as ground visibility here was less than superb. The shovel test revealed
the same sandy loam as ST25 to 43 cm before hitting caliche. A couple of tested cobbles
and a few interior flakes were noted, though the density was only a small fraction of what
we saw at 41TG622.
Shovel test 28 was placed east of ST27 near the divide between the bluff top and
residential areas. Here the topsoil was reddish yellow sandy clay loam in which flakes
were present to 42 cm, at which point caliche was encountered. A few pieces of worked
chert were observed east of the fence line, but no shovel tests were conducted here as it
was in residential property and ground visibility was over 30 percent. Given the high
degree of deflation and the close proximity of the site to residential areas, the lack of
diagnostic artifacts is attributed to the site type, which is most likely a lithic production
site where early stages of manufacture occur.
The residential tracts extend 440 meters east from 41TG621. Elevation decreases
throughout this area. Ground visibility was between 20 and 80 percent through these front
and backyard settings. Aside from 41TG621, no artifacts were observed on the surface in
the remainder of the route. One shovel test was excavated on the west side of a small, dry
draw (ST29) that separates the residential and field areas. The shovel test contained dark
brown clay loam to a depth of 60 cm, but no artifacts were found.
Finally, freshly plowed fields made up the remaining 800 meters of the waterline. The
elevation here was analogous to that of the residential area and ground visibility was
between 70 and 95 percent. No artifacts were observed on the surface. Four shovel tests
(30 through 33) were excavated at 200 meter intervals approximately 5 meters north of
the fence line to explore for cultural materials and the check sedimentation due to the
close proximity of the route to the Concho River. All four shovel tests contained brown to
dark brown sandy to loamy clays that became extremely compact with depth. The high
degree of compaction is likely due to caliche cementation.
Section 46 is approximately .50 miles long and south of US 67 where parallels South
Socha Loop on the north side of the road (Appendix A: Figure 5). Survey determined that
this route crosses through a low potential area of residential neighborhoods where ground
visibility was between 50 and 70 percent. No cultural material was recorded in either
section of the waterlines.
Section 12 runs from the southwest to the northeast on the north side of Switzer Road for
approximately .96 miles (Appendix A: Figure 8). It crosses through level terrain of
plowed fields and unimproved pastures. Ground visibility was between 40 and 90
percent, and one isolated flake and a tested core was identified along the fence line. The
gravelly loamy soil included chert nodules and eroded limestone bedrock, yet no other
cultural material was identified during the survey.

Harriet Quad
Section 10 is approximately 1.77 miles long and parallels the southeast side of the
Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and the north side of Harriett Road before it
crosses into a subdivision along Alma Jo Drive just north of US 67 (Appendix A: Figure
5). Ground visibility ranged from 30 to 70 percent, and the terrain was level along the
railroad and road easements (Figure 14).

Figure 14.

Section 46 parallels Harriet Road and the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad on the left side of the rail line, view is facing southwest.

Mereta Quad
Section 13 parallels for 1.01 mile Bledsoe Road on the south side to the western edge of
the town of Mereta (Appendix A: Figure 9). From east to west, the waterline route
crosses through front yards of residential lots, with a total of 22 houses or sheds, yet all
were out of the waterline ROW. The route then crosses through a recently mowed hay
field. The terrain was level, and ground visibility was between 40 and 80 percent.
Granular, poor quality chert was on the surface, yet no cultural material was recorded.
Section 14 is one road south of Section 13, and crosses east-west for approximately 1.90
miles on the south side of FM 388 (Appendix A: Figure 9). Three structures are set back

from the road and are south of the waterline ROW by 100 to 150 feet. In front of the
houses, fields of recently harvested cotton were walked, and the ground visibility was
excellent. Chert cobbles were in the fields, but no cultural materials were recorded during
the survey.
Section 15 begins at the intersection of FM 388 and 4th Road just west of Section 14
(Appendix A: Figure 9). The waterline route extends south for approximately 1.41 miles
through level cotton fields. Constant plowing of the field has developed a low berm along
the northern and western boundaries of the field. Ground visibility was 100 percent, and
limestone rocks and chert nodules were on the surface, yet none appeared worked and
could have been machine broken.
Section 16 begins at the intersection of FM 765 and 3rd Road and extends south for 1.14
miles, then splits to the west and east along Jarrett Road and Whitfield Road for .60 and
.93 miles respectively (Appendix A: Figure 9). As in the other upland settings, the terrain
was level, and the route primarily crossed through the loam and clay cotton fields and
pastures where ground visibility ranged from 80 to 100 percent. Chert nodules were
present within the route, and two isolated artifacts were recorded south of Jarrett Road, a
Thick Biface with one side heavily patinated, and one secondary flake. Although an
abundance of chert was present, these were the only worked pieces identified, and the
artifacts are considered isolated finds. At the east end of Jarrett Road near the waterline
ROW, an Aeromotor windmill stands adjacent to the fenceline. The house set back from
the road on the same property is modern, and appears to have been constructed in the last
10 years. No other cultural material was recorded within this section of the waterline.
Vancourt Quad
Section 59 begins at the intersection of Roberts Road and SH 87. The route parallels SH
87 on the south side and terminates in the town of Vancourt for a distance of 2.41 miles
(Appendix A: Figure 33). The northwest end crosses Lipan Creek and the southeast end
crosses Snake Creek. Rioconcho clay loam is present in the channels of the creeks.
Survey was conducted at the drainage crossings. Snake Creek is mapped as intermittent
and crosses under SH 87. In the town of Vancourt, The route crosses Snake Creek in
front of a gin complex and parallels a gravel entry road to the gin complex. The creek
was dry at the time of survey. The drainage is shallow with gently sloping banks that are
less then one meter deep at the property boundary where the route crosses. Limestone
cobbles were exposed on the west bank and east bank appears to have been modified
during the bridge construction and from the installation of a large gravel pad where a
metal tank is located. One shovel test (MD2) was placed on the west side of the drainage,
and caliche and limestone rocks were encountered at 60 cm below surface. The east bank
contained gravel fill from the construction of the pad (Figure 15). Although the drainage
widens where it is crossed by FM 765, it appears that the creek drains the uplands only
seasonally after heavy rains.
Lipan Creek is mapped as intermittent with clay loam in the channel bottoms. On the east
bank, the route crossed through a pasture and ground visibility was between 30 and 50

percent. Shovel test MD3 was placed approximately 20 m from the channel and compact
gravel layer was encountered at 40 cmbs. A second shovel test (MD4) was placed on the
east bank, and gravels were encountered at 62 cmbs. The route continued into a cotton
field, then terminated on the north side of FM 765. The drainage was approximately 25 m
wide with gently sloping banks that were 3 m deep. Limestone bedrock was exposed in
the channel bottom. The banks of the creek were examined, and a thick gravel layer sits
on top of the limestone bedrock beginning at approximately 40 cm from the surface on
the east bank. The west end of the route crossed through pastures and cotton fields. No
cultural resources were identified during the survey, on either bank or in the shovel tests.

Sections 2 through 4 are located in the town of Wall on the north side of Texas Loop 570
(Appendix A: Figure 2). The routes are .09, .3.and .13 miles in length and parallel
easements. Ground visibility was over 30 percent. These routes are over ½ mile away
from two cemeteries which are located on Texas Loop 570, the Wall Cemetery (Figures
16 and 17) and the St. Ambrose Cemetery.

Sections 5 through 8 parallel roads in a residential neighborhood; Hawk Street,
Commissioner Road, St. Anthony Street, and Lena Lane that are north and south of FM
765 (Appendix A: Figure 3). The waterline routes .31, .20, .43 and .08 miles in length
respectively run along the edge of narrow road easements where existing utilities are
present and the closely cut yards of the residences (Figure 18). No cultural material was
identified within the routes.

Figure 18.

Section 5 of the waterline improvements will run inside the fence line,
view facing south. This is a typical setting for Sections 5-8.

Section 9 is aligned north-south along an unmarked road north of FM 388 (Appendix A:
Figure 4). It begins at the FM 388 intersection on the west side and crosses through a
level, plowed field with 100 percent ground visibility. The route then passes to the east
side of the road to the end of the route to cross through a cotton field for a total length of
.50 mile. A few scatters of poor quality, granular chert were identified on the surface, but
no cultural material was present.
Section 45 is on the west side of Debbs Road and the south side of FM 765 on the
southeast outskirts of San Angelo (Appendix A: Figure 24). The route is approximately
.53 miles long and crosses through cotton fields and unimproved pastures where the
ground visibility was between 70 and 80 percent. The roadway easements on Debbs Road
were less than 10’, while the easements on the south side of FM 765 were approximately
25’ wide. No cultural material were recorded during the survey.

Section 49 is on the eastern outskirts of San Angelo and parallels the south side of FM
388 for .46 miles (Appendix A: Figure 15). Ground visibility was between 80 and 100
percent in a cotton field. No chert or other cultural material was present and there was
eroded bedrock intermixed with the loamy soils of the shallow topsoil.
Wall Quad
Section 53 begins at Milkulik Road on the west side, turns to the east and west to parallel
Walling Pecan Road on the north side, then turns south and parallels the east side of
Robby Jones Road for a total length of 7.12 miles (Appendix A: Figure 30). The route
continues slightly to the west onto the Pecan Station Quad. The majority of the route
crosses through pastures or plowed fields. Survey was conducted for the portion of the
route which crossed the intermittent drainage of Ninemile Creek for approximately 1 km
on either side of the drainage. The mapped soils in this branch of the creek are silty clays,
which are formed in upland valleys. The fencerow had been cleared of vegetation and
push piles of mesquite were east of the route. Ground visibility on either side of the
drainage was between 50 and 60 percent, and the dry drainage was shallow, less then one
meter deep from the road, and approximately 10 m wide. No cultural resources were
located during the survey, and it appears that the creek flows very intermittently, most
likely after heavy seasonal rains.
Section 1 is on the east side of CR 306 on southeast side of San Angelo (Appendix A:
Figure 1). The easements are approximately 50 m wide, and the waterline will run for
approximately 1.29 miles inside the fence lines of residential and commercial properties
(Figure 19). Ground visibility was between 30 and 50 percent the short grass yards. Thin
loamy topsoils overlaid the gravel and caliche bedrock.
San Angelo South Quad
Section 20 is located at the entry of a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of San
Angelo (Appendix A: Figure 13) The .20 mile route is on the east side of Broad Street,
and passes through a recently plowed field where ground visibility was 100 percent. No
cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey.
The 200’ x 200’ tank location is located on the northeast corner of Hawk Avenue and
Holik Road south of the town of Wall (Appendix A: Figure 14). The proposed tank site is
in a pasture where ground visibility is over 50 percent. Decayed bedrock was intermixed
with the loamy soils on the surface, and although chert is present it was of poor quality
and very granular. No cultural materials were located at the tank site.

Section 44 follows CR 368 on the north then east side (Appendix A: Figure 23). The
route continues south and east on the west side of FM 503 and the south side of CR 4698
for a total length of 1.18 miles. At the east end of the route, vegetation within the route
consisted of short grass and push piles of mesquite were in the field. An abandoned house
was over 100 feet from the road and out of the waterline alignment (Figure 20).

Ground visibility was between 30 and 50 percent at the southern end of the route and
thin, loamy topsoil barely overlaid the gravel and caliche bedrock. An unnamed draw was
crossed towards the northern end, and the line terminates in a plowed field where ground
visibility was 100 percent. No water was present in the draw. As the route extends south
along FM 503, it passes through upland pastures. The route is on the opposite side of FM
503 from the Stacey Cemetery. The route was investigated on October 22, 2009, and the
distance from the fence line of the cemetery to the proposed waterline alignment across
the road was measured. The route will be approximately 180 feet from the cemetery
boundaries if placed inside the private property fenceline. The route crosses through
pasture, and no further survey is recommended.
Section 82 is .97 miles long and parallels the east side of CR 330 (Appendix A: Figure
50). The route crosses through level, upland pasture that was overgrown with mesquite
and prickly pear. No survey was recommended.
Leaday and Mustang Quad
Section 80 follows the west side of Lake County Road north from its intersection with
FM 1929, then turns sharply to the southwest to run along the south side of FM 2134
(Appendix A: Figure 22). The route is 2.60 miles in length, and the terrain is primarily
rolling pasture land with a small plowed field at the northern end of the line. Ground
visibility was over 60 percent throughout. Eroded limestone bedrock was visible on the
surface, but no chert was observed. The route was driven, yet since it was in a low
potential area, no survey was recommended.

Sections 34-43 are located near the O.H. Ivie Reservoir (Appendix A: Figure 22). Most
of the routes (34-43) overlap areas previously surveyed before the development of the
reservoir and no previously recorded sites are less than ½ mile of the waterline
alignments. As demonstrated in the records review, although there are multiple
prehistoric and historic sites recorded in the area they are concentrated in the drainage
valleys and on the bluffs and terraces overlooking the Colorado River, not in the uplands
where the routes are located. In addition, the routes are in residential areas that have been
heavily impacted due to the construction of housing developments (Figure 21). Caliche
and limestone bedrock was on the surface in the waterline alignment of Sections 34-43
(Figure 22). The combined sections of these routes total approximately 6.5 miles.
Section 18 follows Apache Hills Road north from its intersection with Ray Stoker Jr.
Highway for 1.01 miles (Appendix A: Figure 11). The area is a mixture of pasture land
and residential development in an upland setting. Ground visibility throughout the section
ranges from 30 to 80 percent. Decaying bedrock is prevalent on the surface. Surveys for
the O.H. Ivie Reservoir have covered much of the surrounding area, showing sites to
exist in close proximity (within ¼ of a mile) to the drainage channels and the route does
not overlap any of the previously recorded sites. No further investigations were
recommended for this route.

Section 81 is .67 miles long a Categorical Exclusion located on the east side of
Millersview near the Athletic Field (Appendix A: Figure 49). The route crosses through
an upland field and parallels county roads on the east side of town and is replacing an
existing line. No further investigations are warranted.
Concho Quad
Section 33 parallels CR 4627 then turns east onto PR 1022 for a total distance of 5.33
miles (Appendix A: Figure 21). This section was driven on November 19th. From north to
south, the route crosses through plowed fields then pasture. Ground visibility was 100
percent in the plowed fields, and large push piles of reddish bedrock lined the fence rows.
In the pasture, ground visibility was between 50 and 70 percent with large limestone
rocks on the surface. A narrow unnamed draw is in the northern section of the line, and a
concrete culvert with the date “5 16 36” inscribed in it is spanned by the road. The culvert
is in the road easement, and the ROW for the waterline is approximately 30 feet to the
east in the plowed field and will not impact the culvert. Although recommended for
survey, the locked gate leading to PR 1022 at the north end of CR4627 was not crossed.
A sign on the gate cautioned would-be crossers of cyanide blocks in the fields and
warned of health hazard (Figure 23). From the gate the survey team saw improved
pasture land. Aerials show evidence of terracing.

Sections 31 and 32 are located in central Concho County (Appendix A: Figure 20). The
routes are located in the uplands away from major drainages and are 2.6 miles and .94
miles in length. The routes were driven to determine if there were any standing structures
near the waterline routes. Section 31 had large limestone rocks (4 to 5 feet in length)
were on the surface. Bedrock was on the surface and an examination of road cuts
determined that there was only a few centimeters of loamy topsoil on the surface. This
section of the waterline will be placed in an existing waterline easement to replace the
current pipe. Section 32 crosses through upland pastures had ground visibility near 50
percent with limestone and caliche on the surface. No survey is recommended for these
routes.

Ballinger Quad
Although no pedestrian survey was recommended for the following routes, they were
driven to determine if any standing structures were in the waterline ROW. Section 70
runs east-west on the north side of CR 240 for .69 miles; the intersection of CR 240 and
CR 259 is at the approximate center of the alignment (Appendix A: Figure 42). The
upland setting contains plowed fields as well as improved and unimproved pasture.
Ground visibility was 30 to 60 percent throughout. Decaying limestone gravel was on the
surface, but no chert was observed. A house foundation was noted on the north side of
CR 240, west of the intersection with CR 259. The 30’ ROW began at the easement, and
the foundations were an additional 20’ beyond the ROW.
Section 72 is in an upland setting on the west side of FM 1874 and follows it north from
its intersection with CR 236 for .83 miles (Appendix A: Figure 43). The entire line is
plotted through plowed fields where ground visibility was 90 percent. Relatively little
limestone gravel was observed on the surface at this location. No chert was observed
along the route. A house sits west of the line but is outside of the 30 foot temporary
easement. Section 85 is along the north side of FM 2406 for a short distance (Appendix
A: Figure 54). The area is an improved upland pasture with 50 to 70 percent ground
visibility. Limestone gravel was abundant on the surface. A few pieces of chert were
observed, but none appeared to be worked.
Paint Rock Quad
Section 71 follows the north side of CR 236 from its intersection with FM 1678 to the
west for .76 miles (Appendix A: Figure 43). The route crosses through plowed fields
(western section of the alignment) and improved pasture (eastern section). Ground
visibility in these two segments is 80 to 90 percent and 30 to 60 percent, respectively.
Limestone gravel is on the surface; one piece of poor quality, machine broken chert was
observed in the plowed field. Section 76 follows the north and east sides of CR 113 for
.55 miles (Appendix A: Figure 47). The area is unimproved pasture with ground visibility
between 50 and 90 percent. Decaying limestone gravel is evident on the surface, but no
chert was observed. No further investigations are recommended for these routes.
Section 28 is a continuation of Section 11 to the east then crosses north into the Miles
Quad (Appendix A: Figure 16). The 1.01 mile route is on the north side of CR 391 and
passed through a recently plowed field where ground visibility was 90-100 percent. To
the south, the route continued on the east side of CR 357 which was also recently plowed,
and terminated at US 67 in a terraced field. Ground visibility was 100 percent in the
plowed field, and 50 percent in the terraced field. No cultural materials were located in
this section.

Section 74 is located on the west side of CR 1329 which runs through the North Speck
Oil Field (Appendix A: Figure 45). The .64 mile route crosses through terraced fields and
pasture. Section 75 begins on the east then the north side of RR 2402 through the Speck
Oil Field for 4.47 miles (Appendix A: Figure 46). Bedrock was exposed in the road cuts,
and lease roads and oil well are concentrated in the northern end of the route, while
terraced fields are towards the southern end of the route. Due to the upland setting away
from drainages, no survey was recommended for these sections.
Rowena Quad
Section 66 this short segment (.47 miles long) parallels CR 440 through improved
pasture with 30 to 60 percent ground visibility (Appendix A: Figure 38). Limestone
gravel and the occasional poor quality piece of chert are visible on the surface.
Section 69 is south of Section 67 and begins on CR 244 (Appendix A: Figure 39). The
route is 2.05 miles long and runs parallel with the south side of IH 67 for a over half of
the alignment. Although no survey was recommended for this route, it was driven to
determine if any standing structures were near the alignment. At this intersection of the
two roads, it turns northeast to follow along the southeast side of US 67. The route along
CR 244 is plowed and recently harvesting cotton fields with 90 percent ground visibility.
Limestone gravel was abundant on the surface with poor quality machine crushed chert
scattered about. The stretch along US 67 exhibited the same surface conditions.
One historic site was recorded at the southeast corner of the intersection of CR 244 and
US 67 (41RN243); the northwest corner of the house sits within the 30’ wide temporary
construction easement, and it is approximately 26 feet from the edge of the road
easement. The site consists of three structures (Figure 24). The primary structure is an LPlan, 1½ story house set atop a pier and beam foundation with board and batten exterior
walls. The home was constructed with a gabled roof, out of which a dormer window
faces south. Bricks stamped with the makers-mark “ABILENE” were used to build the
chimney. A large metal water tank sits at the outside of the house, nearly abutting the
south wall (Figure 25). Two full porches complete the exterior; one is on the front (north)
side of the house, while the other is set within the “L” shape on the east side. Only wire
nails were seen in the home, indicating 20th century construction. Four interior rooms
were mapped on the first floor, but the second story could not be accessed. The second
structure, called Shed 1, sits about 15 meters to the southeast of the main house. It is has
a vertical wall finish with a concrete slab floor. There is one small interior room in the
northeast corner of the structure that may have been added after the original construction.

Again, wire nails were used exclusively. A brick fireplace/hearth and chimney is in the
northwest corner, suggesting that the structure may have been used as a tenant house at
some point. The bricks used for this hearth are stamped “ACME WICHITA FALLS
LUMBERMAN’S SPECIAL.” The third structure, Shed 2, appears to be a small work
shed set 7 meters east of Shed 1. This small structure is in the poorest condition of the
three, but it is clear that it was constructed with wire nails and finished with board and
batten on the exterior. All evidence points to 20th century construction for the entire site.
No shovel tests were excavated around the site as all available land was plowed and had
90 percent ground visibility.
Sheds 1 and 2 are outside of the APE. Though the house does extend into the
construction easement, work crews should have no difficulty in avoiding it during the
installation of the 2” pipeline. Further investigations would be necessary to determine site
eligibility for listing on the NRHP.

Lowake Quad
Section 27 is on the east side of CR 352 and crosses through a recently harvested cotton
field for .99 miles (Appendix A: Figure 7). Chert and limestone were on the surface, and
the chert appeared to be of poor quality. During the records review, it was noted that
there is a historical marker for the Sweet Home School on the west side of the road, yet
the marker was not visible during the survey. Nevertheless, the waterline route is on the
opposite side of the county road, and will not impact the remains of the school.
Eola Quad
Section 64 runs east to west for 1.41 miles in a relatively level setting that terminates at
SH 381 (Appendix A: Figure 36). Since the route crossed through upland pasture setting
parallel to easements, no survey was recommended.
Vick Quad
Section 65 parallels the east side of CR 381, the south side of CR 1386, and the west side
of CR 1391 through plowed fields for a distance of 2.53 miles (Appendix A: Figure 37).
No road easements are present, and the field edge meets the road. Due to the upland
setting in a low potential area, no survey was recommended.

Miles NW and Miles Quad
Section 60 begins at Raley Road and US 67 in Miles, Texas. The waterline will follow
the east side of Raley Road until it reaches FM 2872 (Appendix A: Figure 7). A portion
of this stretch is residential, while the remainder is through plowed fields with 80 percent
or greater ground visibility. The line passes an old house in Miles which sits 31 feet from
the road, and is outside of the 30’ construction easement (Figure 26) In this area there is
no road easement. The route then continues north along FM 2872 through plowed and
terraced fields until the road curves off to the east. Here the terrain rises and is
characterized by pasture lands. The route crosses a draw between two hills through which
FM 2872 is cut. This area was walked and a few tested cobbles were observed; no flakes
or other artifacts were noted on the deflated surface.

Figure 26.

Structure on the east side of Raley Road, Section 60. View to the north.

Another spur of Section 60 is plotted north of Miles, running east from the previously
described spur along the north side of Coke Co Road/FM 1692. This east-west segment
goes through plowed fields before turning north at FM 2333. The route parallels the west
side of FM 2333 to the intersection with CR 106, again through plowed and terraced
fields. Ground visibility was 80 percent throughout. Limestone and some poor quality
chert was evident. The total length of this section is 8.01 miles long. Section 61 is 1.21
miles long and is southeast of Section 55 in the southeast corner of the quad and
continues into the Mereta Quad (Appendix A: Figure 34). No survey was recommended
since the area is primarily pasture.

Mereta Quad
Sections 23 and 24 are between FM 388 and FM 765 (Appendix A: Figure 9). These
routes interconnect with Sections 13 through 16 that were surveyed in October of 2009.
Section 23 is 2.28 miles long and is on the west side of South 3rd Road. At the south end
it begins in a recently cleared cotton field. A shallow drainage, Lipan Creek, is crossed,
towards the north end of the line that is in a pasture but appears to be more of a erosional
draw than a creek (Figure 27). Section 24 begins on the east side of 4th Road and crosses
through cotton and plowed fields where ground visibility was 100 percent. The 2.9 mile
route then turns east and parallels the south side of FM 388, and although chert was
present, it was of poor quality.

Figure 27.

The shallow portion of Lipan Creek in Section 23, view facing west.

Section 26 begins on the north side of Bledsoe Road and loops through the town of
Mereta for a distance of 2.02 miles (Appendix A: Figure 9). The western half of the route
on Bledsoe Road crossed through a plowed field, then the front yards of residential
properties on the outskirts of town. In town, the route continues on the north side of the
road then goes south on the east side of Grand Avenue and Delagarza Road. The route
then turns to the west to parallel the south side of Broadway to terminate at FM 1692.
Multiple structures that could be older than 50 years old were identified in the town of
Mereta. One structure on the south side of Broadway is 50 feet from the road edge,
therefore out of the ROW (Figure 28). Additional structures that may be older than 50
years old are also outside of the waterline ROW on the east side of Grand Avenue and
will not be impacted by installation of the lines (29).

Section 56 is 1.23 miles long and south of SH 765, and crosses through a pasture.
Section 62 is east of Section 24 and is routed in an east-west direction for .86 miles
(Appendix A: Figures 31 and 9). No survey was recommended for these sections as they
are in upland settings away from drainages and parallel county roads or highways.
Vancourt Quad
Section 29 is on the north side of CR 1354 and crossed through terraced fields for 1.38
miles (Figure 30) and extends slightly into the Vick Quad (Appendix A: Figure 17). No
survey was recommended for this route.

Figure 30.

Terraced field in Section 29, the proposed waterline route parallels the
fenceline along CR 1354.

Section 58 is 1.64 miles long and located within the Lipan Flat region west of Lipan
Creek (Appendix A: Figure 32). No survey was recommended in the upland setting
where the route parallels a county road and crosses through a pasture.
Veribest Quad
Sections 21 and 22 are in residential neighborhoods on the east side of San Angelo and
parallel existing roadway easements for distances of 3.69 miles and .48 miles respectively
(Appendix A: Figure 15). The routes follow fence rows where eroded caliche and
limestone bedrock was exposed on the surface and ground visibility was between 50 and
80 percent (Figure 31). Small acreage cotton fields and pastures were between the
residences and the extent of development is shown in the aerial photo, Figure 32.

Section 51 is north of the Concho River and east of San Angelo (Appendix A: Figure
15). The route parallels Holiman Road on the west side through recently plowed fields
for 1.07 miles. No survey was recommended since the route is in an upland setting used
for agricultural purposes.
Section 52 is located near the Lipan Flat region southwest of Section 21 and crossed
through terraced cotton fields on the east side of Wilde Road for 1.11 miles (Appendix A:
Figure 24). The route was driven, but no survey was recommended.
Section 54 is east of Section 52 and crosses through plowed cotton fields in the uplands
for 4.57 miles (Appendix A: Figure 3). This route was also driven, and no further
investigations or survey was recommended.
Wall Quad
Section 57 crosses though the nearly level uplands of the Lipan Flat for 3.29 miles
(Appendix A: Figure 32). The route parallels Ripple Road on the east side through
plowed fields, therefore no survey was recommended.

Section 50 is on the west side of South Ratliff Road (Appendix A: Figure 29). The route
crosses through upland pastures to the South Concho River for .25 miles. No survey was
recommended for this section.
Conclusions
The results of the cultural resource investigations of the low potential areas and intensive
archaeological survey of the high potential areas for the improvements to the Millersview
–Doole WSC have contributed to our knowledge of the archaeological potential of the
Rolling Plains. As anticipated, there is higher potential of finding sites in close proximity
to the Concho and Colorado rivers and their major tributaries, while the site potential for
20th c. historic sites is within 150 feet of historic transportation routes. Several patterns of
site distribution emerged when the data from the present study was combined with that
from previous investigations.

Prehistoric sites are located within a ¼ mile or less of the Concho and Colorado rivers,
and adjacent to the larger drainages such as Kickapoo and Crown Nest Creek. As Creel
suggested for his micro environmental zones for the South Concho River, lithic
production sites and campsites are in riparian zones. Two prehistoric sites, the Chandler
Road site (41TG622) and the Barking Dog site (41TG621) were recorded in the riparian
zone at the confluence of the Concho River and an unnamed tributary. The first was the
Chandler Road site on a bluff edge immediately south of Chandler Road. The site was
located in a field at the edge of a residential neighborhood. Despite the fact that the site
was impacted by the construction of the road, evidence remained of lithic production
activity. To the east was the Barking Dog site, which was similar in character to the
Chandler Road site. Additionally, the hearth site (41CC329) recorded on a hill
overlooking Kickapoo Creek offers tentative evidence of prehistoric occupation. Chert
outcrops were identified throughout the survey area, and it appeared that the higher
quality material was in the western half of the study area, specifically to the north and
south of the Concho River.
Although previous investigations for the O.H. Ivie Reservoir study recorded multiple
historic sites on the bluffs and fluviate terraces overlooking the river, these sites were
over ½ mile away from the proposed waterline alignments and no sites were in the
waterlines near the rivers. Several previously recorded historic resources were
encountered near sections of the proposed waterlines: these included 19th and 20th century
cemeteries, an unmarked grave, and the multiple 20th century structures identified along
various routes and within the town of Mereta. Conversely, the areas surveyed in low
potential areas in the uplands demonstrated that limited cultural material, such as isolated
artifacts in plowed fields, can be present throughout the region, but may have no
contextual integrity. One historic homestead (41RN543) was recorded within the 30’
ROW, and several other structures that were potentially over 50 years were noted outside
of several of the waterline alignments, but within 150’ of the road edge. Investigations at
for the O.H. Ivie Reservoir recorded nineteenth century sites predominantly along the
Colorado and Concho rivers, while 20th century sites appear to be distributed across the
landscape and throughout the uplands. Occupation patterns in the 20th century became
more widespread with the mechanization of farming practices and the increase in
transportation routes to move the crops, specifically cotton, to the gin complexes in the
region. Tenant houses and farmsteads were placed in more centralized locations, and
were not necessarily placed to the closest water source.
The results of these investigations demonstrate the benefits and the limitations of linear
surveys. The benefit was that the waterlines were distributed throughout the landscape
and the investigations were able to examine a variety of topographic settings and to
identify cultural resources. The limitations were that the majority of the routes crossed
through low potential or heavily disturbed areas along road easements. These upland
settings away from water sources were not ideal for long-term prehistoric occupation, but
for resource procurement such as hunting and procurement of lithic resources. The nature
of these settings is that they are heavily trafficked, and disturbed by construction,
plowing, grading, and brush clearing. These activities do lend to excellent ground
exposure, but the results are disturbed artifact distributions with poor contextual integrity.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The investigations for the Millersview-Doole WSC resulted in the recording of four
archaeological sites, three prehistoric (41CC329, Chandler Road site and 41TG621) and
one historic (41RN243). The portions of 41TG621 and 41TG622 within the currently
proposed 30’ right-of-way and the Area of Potential Effect (APE) in Sections 47 and 55
are not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Their status outside the 30’ area of proposed
ROW is unknown. Site 41CC329 south of Section 30 is outside of the APE and requires
no further investigation. The majority of the historic site, 41RN243, is outside of the
ROW, and should be avoided.
In addition, the Wall, St. Ambrose, and Stacey cemeteries are over 100 feet from the
proposed alignments, and should not be impacted. The southern end of Section 30 must
be rerouted onto the east side of the road for approximately .25 miles to avoid the
unmarked grave on the west side of CR 1445.
The drainages will be bored, and in general the bore points will be over 50 feet from the
banks, which is not problematic for the majority of the drainage crossings, as the survey
results demonstrate that most of the drainages do not contain floodplain soils. The
exception is Bluff Creek on the north side of FM 765 which is crossed by Section 84, and
ARC recommends that the bore points be set back 300 feet on the west bank and 100 feet
on the east bank to avoid the floodplain deposit.
Based on these results of this study, ARC recommends that no further investigations are
warranted and that the Millersview-Doole WSC can proceed with their project. If buried
cultural resources are discovered during the installation of the lines, ARC recommends
that work stop in the immediate area and the THC be notified.
