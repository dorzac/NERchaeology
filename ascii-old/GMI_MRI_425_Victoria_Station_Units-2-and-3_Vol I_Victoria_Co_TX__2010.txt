EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In conjunction with the proposed construction of the Victoria County Station, Units 1 and 2,
project site, a Phase Ib cultural resources assessment was undertaken to satisfy federal
requirements for the identification and evaluation of cultural resources that might be affected by
the development of the proposed facility. The Victoria site is the proposed location for the
development of a nuclear power plant and is located approximately 13 miles south-southwest of
Victoria, Texas, on the southern Texas Gulf Coast plain. The Victoria County Station, Units 1
and 2, project site will encompass approximately 11,500 acres and is situated just west of the
Guadalupe River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico at San Antonio Bay.
Due to the potential impacts from the proposed Victoria County Station construction project on
cultural resources properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic-era buildings, structures, and
landscapes), Geo-Marine, Inc., was contracted by Tetra Tech NUS, Inc. (under Order Number
1029330, Modification 1), to conduct the Phase Ib studies (Geo-Marine project number
30320.00.05) to record and evaluate cultural resources in the area of potential effects (APE), as
required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347;
P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the guidance of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NUREG-1555]. This contract was initiated on 5 February
2008.
The Phase Ib investigations conducted in May and June 2008 consisted of three tasks: (1)
archaeological survey; (2) rural historic landscape assessment; and (3) historic resources and
visual impact analyses. The results of those investigations are presented in three volumes.
Volume I presents the archaeological investigations; Volume II consists of the rural historic
landscape study, and the historic resources and visual impact analyses; and Volume III contains
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) forms for architectural buildings and structures
identified during the rural historic landscape and historic resources/visual impact studies.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a Phase Ib cultural resources assessment conducted in relation
to the proposed development of the Victoria County Station, Units 1 and 2, project site. The
Victoria County Station site is the proposed location for the development of a nuclear power plant
approximately 13 miles south-southwest of Victoria, Texas. The Victoria County Station site
encompasses approximately 11,500 acres. Approximately 9,431 acres comprises the Area of
Potential Effects (APE) which would be impacted by the development of the power plant and a
cooling basin and reservoir surrounded by a berm approximately 25 feet in height. All
construction and operation activities for the site facilities would take place within the APE.
Based on previous investigations of the APE (Peter and Prior 2008) and with concurrence from
the State Historic Preservation Officer, a more focused 2,954-acre archaeological survey area was
developed from the larger 11,500-acre project site and this survey area is the focus of the current
report.
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed Victoria County Station project to cultural resource
properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic-era buildings and structures), Tetra Tech NUS,
Inc., contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., to conduct Phase Ib studies to record and evaluate historic
properties in the APE, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42
U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the
guidance of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NUREG-1555]. This contract was initiated on
5 February 2008. The results of the archaeological survey are the focus of this volume of the
report.
The Phase Ib survey conducted in May and June 2008 recorded five archaeological sites and three
localities. Two of the sites (41VT145 and 41VT146) were recorded as having exclusively
historic components and three (41VT147, 41VT148, and 41VT149) were identified as
exclusively prehistoric. Additionally, three localities (Locality 1, Locality 2, and Locality 3)
were exclusively prehistoric in nature. Using NHRP eligibility criteria, all sites encountered
within the survey area are recommended as not eligible. Both historic sites (41VT145 and
41VT146) lacked verifiable historical documentation and contextual integrity; severely impeding
their ability to yield significant information. The prehistoric sites (41VT147, 41VT148, and
41VT149) all lacked artifact assemblages or feature complexes that would retain sufficient data to
address questions of technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction.
v

Upon completion of the project, all cultural materials collected for this project will be returned to
the respective landowner or, upon landowner's written permission, transferred to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin for permanent curation and storage. All written
records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin for permanent
curation and storage.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of a Phase Ib cultural resources assessment conducted in relation
to the proposed development of the Victoria County Station, Units 1 and 2, project site. The
Victoria project site is the proposed location for the development of a nuclear power plant
approximately 13 miles south-southwest of Victoria, Texas (Figure 1). The Victoria County
Station project site encompasses approximately 11,500 acres and is situated approximately 1
kilometer west of the right descending bank of the Guadalupe River, which empties into the Gulf
of Mexico at San Antonio Bay. Approximately 9,431 acres comprise the Area of Potential
Effects (APE) that would be impacted by the development of the power plant and a cooling basin
and reservoir area with a surrounding berm that ranges in height from approximately 7–37 feet
(ft) above ground, based on the surrounding elevations. The tallest of the power plant structures
(the turbine building) would rise approximately 166 ft above the upland coastal plain surface.
Based on previous investigations of the APE and with concurrence from the State Historic
Preservation Officer, a more focused 2,954-acre archaeological survey area was developed from
the larger 11,500-acre project site (Peter and Prior 2008). Throughout this report, the term
archaeological survey area will refer to the 2,954 acres intensively surveyed for cultural
resources.
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed Victoria County Station project to cultural resource
properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic-era buildings and structures), Geo-Marine, Inc.,
was contracted by Tetra Tech NUS, Inc. (under Order Number 1029330, Modification 1), to
conduct Phase Ib studies (GMI project number 30320.00.05) to record and evaluate cultural
resources in the APE. These compliance investigation are required by the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852],
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. §
470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the guidance of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[NUREG-1555]. This contract was initiated on 5 February 2008.
The Phase Ib investigations conducted in May and June 2008 consisted of three tasks: (1)
archaeological survey; (2) rural historic landscape assessment; and (3) historic resources and
visual impact analyses. The results of those investigations are presented in three volumes.
Volume I (this volume) presents the archaeological investigations; Volume II consists of the rural
historic landscape study, and the historic resources and visual impact analyses; and Volume III
1

contains the Texas Historical Commission forms for architectural buildings and structures
identified during the rural historic landscape and historic resources/visual impact studies.
The prehistoric context, in conjunction with previous geoarchaeological investigations (Peter and
Prior 2008), clearly indicate that the landscape within the 11,500-acre project site is variable, with
significant implications for the location and contextual integrity of prehistoric archaeological
sites. Although no known sites are recorded for the APE based on data obtained at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, the highest probability area for prehistoric
sites appears to be along the Guadalupe River Valley margin, rather than on the dry upland
coastal plain. A sampling strategy, based on the diversity of the landforms present as well as
known regional prehistoric and historic settlement patterns, was developed to guide the
archaeological survey methodology.
Five archaeological sites and three localities were located as part of the Phase Ib archaeological
survey (Table 1). Two of these sites (41VT145 and 41VT146) were recorded as having
exclusively historic components and three sites (41VT147, 41VT148, and 41VT149) were
identified as exclusively prehistoric. Additionally, the three localities (Locality 1, Locality 2, and
Locality 3) are exclusively prehistoric in nature.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

This chapter discusses the environmental setting of Victoria County Station, Units 1 and 2. The
project area is located in the Guadalupe River drainage of the middle Texas gulf coastal plain,
approximately 13 miles south-southwest of the town of Victoria in Victoria County. The
following sections summarize the area’s geology and geomorphology, soils, hydrology, climate,
flora, and fauna. Finally, biotic and nonbiotic resources that could have been of potential benefit
to prehistoric peoples are discussed.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
Geoarchaeological investigations were undertaken in the project area in early 2008 to characterize
the landscape and the potential context of archaeological deposits (superficial or buried) within
different portions of the 11,500-acre project site (Peter and Prior 2008). Although there have
been few large-scale surveys of the coastal plain landscape that have examined the
geomorphology in detail, a solid start is provided by Abbott (2001), who compiled a broad suite
of local geomorphic and Quaternary stratigraphic information to achieve a similar goal for the
Houston District of the Texas Department of Transportation, which shares a geological landscape
similar to the project area. Site contexts within the coastal plain vary significantly, for the
landscape is dynamic, with factors such as alluvial sedimentation and erosion, eolian deposition,
colluvial deposition, and sea-level rise during the Holocene period, all affecting site location and
site integrity.
The project site consists of two distinct landscapes, the Pleistocene uplands and the Guadalupe
River valley margin, each of which contains a distinct suite of landforms and geomorphic history
(Figure 2). Although the Pleistocene uplands might be dismissed as having little potential for
containing sites with contextual integrity, the presence of wetland depressions, the potential for
eolian burial of site contexts, and the presence of Dry Kuy and Kuy creeks suggested that limited
areas of the uplands should be investigated for potential buried site contexts (see Figure 2).
However, the primary focus of the geoarchaeological investigations was along the Guadalupe
River valley margin where the potential for Holocene-period alluvial deposits and colluvial
toeslopes suggests that buried site contexts with contextual integrity would be common.
5

The Uplands
The middle Texas gulf coastal plain is underlain by a series of coastward-dipping fluvial and
fluvial-deltaic deposits that have largely been mapped on the basis of their geomorphic
expression as morphostratigraphic units. These surfaces are generally separated from one another
by gentle scarps and often differ significantly in terms of their topography and the clarity of relict
fluvial geomorphic features preserved on their surface as viewed from the ground (cf.
descriptions in Sellards et al. 1932:786, 792–793) or on aerial imagery. In general terms, as the
surfaces become older, the definition of relict fluvial geomorphic features diminishes, a process
referred to by Fisk (1940) as “landscape deterioration.” The relationship of these surface deposits
to subsurface geology is reported to be somewhat tenuous (Winker 1990b). In the vicinity of the
project area, two Pleistocene-age coastal morphostratigraphic units are present: the Lissie
Formation and the Beaumont Formation.
Which of these two deposits is present in the project site appears to be disputed. The most widely
cited authoritative source on the geology of this region, the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG
1975) Geologic Atlas of Texas, maps the project site as the Lissie Formation, and the upland
surface on the opposite side of the Guadalupe River as the Beaumont Formation (Figure 3). This
asymmetry in the spatial distribution of the two main Pleistocene coast-wise deposits on each side
of the Guadalupe River south of Victoria appears on geologic maps of the region as early as 1932
(e.g., Sellards et al. 1932:754, Figure 50). The most recent geologic assessment of this region
(Winker 1990a), however, has remapped much of the upland at the confluence of the San Antonio
and Guadalupe rivers as Beaumont Formation (see Figure 3, inset). Discussions with Charlie
Winker (personal communication 2008) reveals that the topography and surface gradient in these
two areas are nearly identical, and this, in part, led him to map the project area as Beaumont
Formation. It may also be relevant to note that recent papers on the geology of the gulf coastal
plain have adopted Winker’s map in favor of the BEG map (cf. Blum and Aslan 2006:179).
Because the geologic nature of the substrate within the project area is in doubt, a brief
introduction to each unit seems warranted.

The Lissie Formation
The older of the two coastal terrace deposits is the Lissie Formation, which was first named the
“Lissie gravel” by Deussen (1914). Sellards et al. (1932) trace the history of this deposit and note
that in common usage the Lissie Formation consists of sediments above the Willis Formation and
beneath the Beaumont Formation. It forms a belt of sediment that parallels the modern coastline
that is around 30 miles wide and extends roughly 50 miles inland.
The Lissie Formation is primarily composed of fluvial sediments that were deposited during one
or more Pleistocene interglacial periods (Aronow n.d.), although deltaic and marine sediments are
also present within this deposit (Sellards et al. 1932). The majority of the Lissie Formation is
coarse-textured sand and gravel, and below the modern soil, the formation exhibits reddish hues
in outcrop and bluish and greenish gray in cores (Sellards et al. 1932). Predominantly coarsetextured, fine, shrink-swell clays common in the Beaumont Formation also occur in the Lissie
Formation (Aronow n.d.; Price 1934:948).

7

The surface expression of the Lissie Formation is considered to be very gently rolling (as
compared to the Beaumont, which is generally quite flat and dips gently toward the modern coast)
and unlike the Beaumont Formation, the Lissie generally lacks clear expression of relict fluvial
landforms such as paleochannels and meander belts (Price 1934; Sellards et al. 1932). Aronow
(n.d.) notes that among the most common surface features of the Lissie Formation are pimple
mounds and circular wetland depressions, the latter of which are thought to be wind deflation
features.
Lissie Formation Age and Fossil Content: The Lissie Formation is clearly of Pleistocene age,
but the precise period of deposition is unknown. Existing age estimates are based primarily upon
its fossil content, magnetic polarity, and general stratigraphic position. A variety of vertebrate
fossils has been recovered from the Lissie Formation. Horses, in particular, were one of the
original finds upon which the formation was distinguished (cf. Dumble [1894] originally called
the Lissie the “Equus beds”; see also Deussen 1924:108; Hay 1915; Lundelius and Stevens 1970)
and), and two species have been recovered from the Lissie (Equus francisci Hay and Equus
complicatus). In addition to horse remains, Deussen (1924) notes that many of the fossils
recovered from the Lissie, such as Trucifelis fatalis, Elephas imperator, Bison latifrons, and
Glyptodon, are of early Pleistocene age. Although the inclusion of early Pleistocene vertebrate
fossils does not necessarily denote an Early Pleistocene depositional age (cf. Baskin 1991), these
remains comprise one line of evidence. Kukla and Opdyke (1972; as cited in Winker 1990b:586)
obtained reversed polarity paleomagnetic samples from the Lissie Formation, which suggest that
these deposits are of early Pleistocene age and were deposited during the Matayuma epoch that
dates between 1.7 and 2.48 million years B.C.

The Beaumont Formation
The Beaumont Formation is the youngest of the coast-parallel Pleistocene-age deposits. It crops
out on the coastward side of and laps onto the Lissie Formation. It was first named by Hayes and
Kennedy (1903) for exposures near Beaumont, Texas. Unlike the Lissie Formation, which is
generally considered to be relatively coarse-textured, the Beaumont is known for its clayey
deposits and relatively well-preserved relict fluvial geomorphic features (cf. Van Siclen 1985).
Deposition of the Beaumont Formation is attributed to fluvial-deltaic processes during an
interglacial period. The surface of the Beaumont Formation is generally flatter than the Lissie
Formation and is known for its prominent vertisols and well-developed gilgai that cover more
than 4 million hectares (Nordt et al. 2006).
Beaumont Formation Age and Fossil Content: A few vertebrate fossils have been recovered
from the Beaumont Formation (most notably Elephas imperator Leidy), but the most common
fossils reported are marine and brackish water invertebrates such as Rangia cuneata Gray and
Ostrea virginica Gmelin (Deussen 1924; Sellards et al. 1932). These are of little assistance in
dating the unit. Radiocarbon ages have been used to constrain the upper limit of Beaumont
Formation deposition at around 35,000 years (cf. Birdseye and Aronow 1991:A223; Gaston 1979;
Nordt et al. 2006), but many samples of potentially radiocarbon datable material (shells and
wood) that have been dated returned “dead” ages in excess of 40,000 years old (Aronow 1988;
Heinrich 2007; McFarlan 1961; Otvos 1971). The Beaumont clearly predates the Deweyville
terraces that are inset into it and mark the entrenchment of the modern streams. Recent
luminescence dating by Durbin (Durbin 1999; Durbin et al. 1997) has yielded ages for both the
Beaumont Formation and the Deweyville terraces along the Nueces River. Durbin et al. (1997)
9

report thermoluminescence (TL) dates for the Beaumont Formation derived from cutbank
exposures around Nueces Bay of 91.7±7.9 ka and 71.9±6.9 ka and suggest that these ages provide
an upper limit to Beaumont sedimentation that is consistent with TL dates from the High
Deweyville terrace of 52.6±5.2 ka by Durbin et al. (1997) and optically stimulated luminescence
(OSL) dates of 63.1±4.0 ka and 50.4±3.2 ka reported by Aiuvalasit (2006, 2007).
Recently, Blum and Aslan (2006) and Blum and Price (1998) have presented new stratigraphic
and geochronologic information for the Beaumont Formation near the mouth of the Colorado
River that demonstrates that it is considerably more complex than previously thought. In specific,
they have demonstrated that the complex of Beaumont Formation meanderbelts mapped by BEG
can be separated into at least three distinct incised valley fills that they informally named the
Lolita, El Campo, and Bay City. The oldest of these is the Lolita, which has yielded TL dates of
307 and 323 ka, placing its deposition in oxygen isotope stage 9. The intermediate age unit, the
El Campo, is undated but thought to have been deposited during oxygen isotope stage 7, whereas
the youngest Beaumont-age incised valley deposit, the Bay City, has yielded TL dates from
channel sands that range between 155 and 102 ka, placing its deposition during the falling sea
levels of oxygen isotope stage 6 and the sea level high-stand of oxygen isotope stage 5. As a
result, Blum and Aslan (2006) suggest that the Beaumont Formation likely includes deposits from
the entire post-Lissie period but preceding the incision and deposition of the first Deweyville
Formation deposits. This interpretation is in opposition to previous impressions of the Beaumont
Formation as a last interglacial high-stand deposit.
Although the precise geological age and the formation of the uplands within the project site are
disputed, the outcome is largely irrelevant for archaeological purposes given that both
depositional units are clearly of Pleistocene age and the potential for site burial by Holocene
depositional processes is minimal, except in specific landscape settings.

Geomorphic Features
The upland environment within the project site is relatively flat and exhibits significant
topographic variation only in proximity to the Guadalupe River valley edge and in proximity to
major streams. Away from the Guadalupe valley margin, the upland is nearly devoid of
significant geomorphic features. Surface elevation ranges from 70 to 80 ft. The most prominent
features present are variable-scale wetland depressions that are, in some cases, undrained and in
other instances appear to form cascading wet meadows that eventually link to existing drainage
networks but generally lack channels or evidence of channelized flow. These features are often
clearest on the very gentle convex drainage divides in sandy upland settings and are present in a
wide range of sizes, from more than half a kilometer wide to a few tens of meters.
The deposits in the uplands of the project site can be divided into two different groups based upon
the near-surface texture and co-occurring landforms: clayey deposits associated with gilgai and
sandy deposits associated with pimple mounds and wetland depressions. The landforms are
discussed in the following paragraphs, while further details of the clayey and sandy deposits are
presented in the Soils section later in this chapter.

10

Clayey Deposits—Gilgai
Gilgai are a form of patterned ground that is created by repeated wetting and drying of soils that
contain significant amounts of smectitic (shrink-swell) clay (see Ahmad and Mermut 1996 and
Gustavson 1975 for more discussion on these features). On flat surfaces, gilgai typically form a
mosaic of small enclosed depressions (often termed “microlows,” known in the vernacular as
“hog-wallows”) rimmed by linear bands of slightly higher ground (termed “microhighs”), but on
sloping surfaces they may form linear ridges and depressions (sometimes referred to as “linear
gilgai” [Gustavson 1975:3] or “tiger stripe gilgai” [Driese et al. 2000:187]) that have long axes
that are approximately parallel to the slope. Both forms were observed within the project site.

Sandy Deposits

Pimple Mounds
Pimple mounds are generally circular in plan form and consist of flat to gently convex mounds
between 30 and 50 m in diameter (sometimes smaller, sometimes larger) and less than 1 m in
height. These landforms are often referred to in general terms as Mima mounds (named after
similar landforms that occur on the Mima prairie in Washington State) and occur most often on
surfaces that are periodically flooded. Although these landforms may occur in groups and cover
large areas in this region, no large mound fields were seen at the project site. Occasional isolated
mounds were observed at the project site, and often when a single mound was seen, others
became apparent in the immediate vicinity. Some of the most prominent pimple mounds
observed were located within or around the margins of wetland depressions, and these mounds
may have a higher than average probability of prehistoric occupation.
The geomorphic origin of pimple mounds is a hotly debated subject and one of the few
outstanding geomorphic controversies in North America. Abbott’s (2001) summary of the
subject covers the main formation processes relevant to this region and provides a list of expected
observations that may be associated with each proposed formation process. At this time, three
main mechanisms are proposed to explain the origin of these mounds: (1) bioturbation by
fossorial animals, (2) eolian accumulation, and (3) differential erosion. The most compelling
formation process for such mounds is bioturbation by mammals that live underground (fossorial
mammals, e.g., pocket gophers in particular), and it is their activities around a central point or
nest and tendency to push earth behind them when they burrow that leads to net soil transfer
toward the nest area. The main recent proponents of this hypothesis, Cox and Gakahu (1986) and
Horwath and Johnson (2006), have compiled a compelling body of information supporting this
concept. In Texas, additional support for this hypothesis may be found in observations of
mounds that have formed in the Historic period, of which there are two from nearby Colorado
County. One of these is an account of a mound that formed under a house in 17 years (Bailey
1923:23–24), and another was documented in a Master’s thesis written by a petroleum geologist
who observed mound formation over a period of five years (Koons 1948; see also Price 1949).
Geologist Saul Aronow (n.d.) was a strong proponent of the eolian hypothesis and firmly believed
that most of these mounds on the Texas gulf coastal plain are coppice dunes. Although this
mechanism cannot be used to account for all Mima-like mounds across North America because
many contain a significant number of small stones that are beyond the transport capacity of wind,
the sandy composition of pimple mounds on the Texas coastal plain lends itself to this argument.
11

Finally, differential erosion is the last major mechanism proposed for mound formation (cf. Cain
1974).
Pimple mounds are well known as the preferred sites of prehistoric habitation on the Texas
coastal plain (see discussion in Abbott 2001), and such sites are likely to have low archaeological
visibility. The integrity of such sites is debatable and highly contingent upon the formative
processes. If the mounds are eolian, then the likelihood for archaeological sites in good context is
high, but if such mounds are an artifact of pedoturbation, then such sites are likely to be very
disturbed.

Upland Wetland Depressions
One of the most distinctive geomorphic features of the sandy uplands is the depressional
wetlands. These subtle depressions are generally very flat, often have pronounced edges, and
standing water that may be less than 30 centimeters (cm) deep.
Aronow (n.d.) notes that one of the most common surface features of the Lissie Formation is
circular-to-elliptical undrained depressions, but then goes on to note that such “rounded to
irregular undrained depressions, 50 to 250 m in largest dimension” are probably the product of
wind deflation and are locally abundant on the surfaces of both the Lissie and Beaumont
formations. He further notes that they appear to be restricted to areas of sandy and loamy soils,
and on the Beaumont they are confined to ancient meander ridges. It should be noted that the
depressional wetlands in the APE could have been created or made more persistent when the
ranch road system was established. Roads are landscape features, even with culverts, and can
block natural down-gradient flows along topographic corridors.

Guadalupe Valley Margin
Along the eastern edge of the project site is the margin of the Guadalupe River valley. The
topographic break at this margin creates a diverse series of landforms—eroded slopes, toeslopes,
alluvial fans, terraces, and other features—due to the interaction of erosive and depositional
forces along the transition from uplands to valley floor.

Eroded Slopes, Toeslopes, and Alluvial Fans
Eroded slopes were identified where the Pleistocene upland is generally exposed as a broad slope
down to Low Deweyville terraces. These slopes have experienced net soil loss and therefore
have limited potential for the preservation of archaeological materials. Alluvial fans at the
bottom of the eroded slopes, however, appear to contain deep Holocene deposits that have the
potential to contain archaeological material.

12

High Deweyville Terraces
Whereas the Beaumont and Lissie formations represent alluvial deposition during periods of
relatively high sea level during Pleistocene interglacial periods, alluvial deposition also occurred
during periods of falling and low sea levels associated with glacial periods. The best-preserved
deposits of this nature are series of alluvial terraces that were formed during the last glacial period
that are inset into and form terrace surfaces below the Beaumont Formation. These terraces were
formally named the “Deweyville beds” by Bernard (1950) for deposits exposed along the Sabine
River in southeast Texas and defined as alluvial terrace deposits that are lower in elevation than
the Beaumont Formation but higher than the modern floodplains. Deweyville terraces exhibit
relict channel dimensions considerably larger than modern river channels, a point first noted by
Barton (1930), and later Bernard. Details of the number, origin, and significance of the
Deweyville terraces has been the subject of considerable speculation for some time, with Blum
and Aslan (2006) providing the most comprehensive discussion to date.
Blum and Aslan (2006:191–194) note that the larger streams along the Texas coast exhibit at least
three suites of Deweyville landforms/deposits that represent streams that were graded to lower
sea levels than modern. The Deweyville streams were deposited into valleys cut into the
Beaumont Formation, and these incision events essentially define the modern river valleys along
the coast to this day. The deposits of the Deweyville streams are significantly different from the
Beaumont Formation deposits in that they are predominantly coarse-grained, with fine-textured
sediments largely confined to lenticular channel fills. Laterally extensive vertical accretion facies
(fine-grained deposits) are rare, and in this regard, the Deweyville stream deposits present a stark
contrast to the Beaumont Formation alluvial deposits that are largely fine-grained. Dating of the
Deweyville deposits is ongoing, with the most recent studies citing ages that date to oxygen
isotope stages 4 to 2 (ca. 58,000 to 14,000 years B.C.).
Within the Guadalupe River valley, the Deweyville terraces have been examined by several
projects. In a paleogeographic study of the lower Guadalupe River valley, Weinstein (1992)
identified the older Deweyville 1 and a younger Deweyville 2 terrace that correlate to our
identification of a High Deweyville (Deweyville 1) and a Low Deweyville (Deweyville 2) in the
project site. The chronology of these deposits was long debated (Blum et al. 1995), but recent
dating by OSL within the valley of the Guadalupe River (Aiuvalasit 2006, 2007) dated the High
Deweyville to 50–60 ka, and the Deweyville deposits at the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98) yielded
OSL dates between 49 and 53 ka. This correlates reasonably well with a 52 ka date for High
Deweyville terraces along the Nueces River (Durbin et al. 1997). The ages of these deposits
preclude the presence of archaeological materials being preserved in intact deposits of
Deweyville. However, archaeological materials are routinely recovered in the upper portions of
Deweyville deposits (Abbott 2001) where these sediments have presumably been reworked by
wind and/or slope processes, as they were at both Buckeye Knoll and McNeill Ranch sites. A
recent study of site formation processes in Deweyville deposits demonstrates that both localized
secondary deposition during the Holocene, and bioturbation processes, can bury archaeological
materials (Aiuvalasit 2007). Remnants of High Deweyville deposits on the upper backslopes of
the valley margin of the project site required deep testing to assess the potential for recovering
archaeological materials (Peter and Prior 2008).

13

Low Deweyville Terraces
The Low Deweyville terrace forms a well-defined constructional alluvial surface below High
Deweyville remnants at the foot of the valley wall. This surface was incorrectly mapped by the
Bureau of Economic Geology as Holocene alluvium. Unlike the High Deweyville remnants that
lack surficial expression as a terrace, the Low Deweyville exhibits typical terrace morphology of
a level tread and scarp slope. The elevations for this surface along the project site’s valley
margins range from 30–12 ft. Close to Linn Lake, the edge of this surface has clearly been
affected by erosion, whereas at the rear of this surface (adjacent to the upland margin/slope),
there appears to have been colluvial/alluvial fan sedimentation in the period of time that followed
abandonment of this surface by the Guadalupe River. Along the Nueces River, this terrace was
identified as the Middle Deweyville and dated by TL and OSL to 40-41 ka (Durbin et al. 1997).
The Low Deweyville terrace within the project site is nearly the same elevation as the Deweyville
terrace observed at the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), which was OSL-dated to 49–53 ka
(Frederick and Bateman 2007).
Following abandonment by the Guadalupe River, this surface has experienced significant erosion.
Post-Deweyville sedimentation has also occurred upon this surface in several discrete locations:
in alluvial fans at the mouths of low-order tributaries; in toeslope positions at the rear of the
surface immediately adjacent to the valley wall; and on low-lying surfaces adjacent to Linn Lake.
The broad Low Deweyville terrace surface situated immediately south of the confluence of Linn
Bayou and the Guadalupe River is the only place within the project site where extensive
Holocene sedimentation was observed. The presence of a significant shell lens in the root ball of
the upturned tree on a featureless, flat surface demonstrates that not all human habitation of the
area was restricted to positive relief features.

SOILS

Clay Soils
The location and extent of clay deposits observed in the field appear to be fairly well-defined by
the Lake Charles soil series as mapped by Miller (1982), with limited examples of other clays
such as Aransas, Rydolph, and Trinity. In the vicinity of the survey area, outcrops of the most
common clays, the Lake Charles series, appear to occur in roughly three northwest–southeasttrending bands (Figure 4). The most extensive of these parallels the course of Kuy Creek on the
western side of the project site. Another band roughly parallels the course of the eastern branch
of Dry Kuy Creek. The third band is represented by discrete, roughly circular areas of Lake
Charles series soils immediately adjacent to the Guadalupe River valley margin. The clayey
surface deposits are widely thought to represent flood basin depositional settings of the
Pleistocene rivers that deposited the coastal terraces.
The soils formed in the clayey deposits are typically vertisols (self-mulching soils), and
microrelief landforms such as gilgai may be present. On flat surfaces, gilgai microlows are
underlain by bowl-like structures consisting of organic-rich clay that exhibit many slickensides
and prominent wedge-shaped soil structure. The soil profile beneath the microhighs are
significantly different from the microlows in that these profiles generally have much thinner A14

horizons, shallower Bk horizons, and less well-developed slickensides. Within the microlows,
the organic-rich clay generally has been leached of calcium carbonate to depths ranging from
0.8 m to >1.5 m, and the microhighs are leached to a much shallower depth.
As with the soils formed in the sandy deposits, the subsoil horizons of the clayey deposits
typically exhibit evidence of possible pedogenic overprinting in the form of well-developed
redoximorphic features like iron manganese concretions in Bk horizons with abundant nodular
pedogenic calcium carbonate. It is possible that the co-existence of these features may be a
product of seasonal moisture differences, but their co-occurrence would seem to be better
explained by long-term climatic variation.
The prominent shrink-swell habit of vertisols presents conditions that are less than favorable for
good preservation of archaeological sites, and Abbott (2001) provides an extensive discussion of
the processes that prevail in these soils. Two processes are prominent in vertisols: upward
movement of large clasts, and the downward movement of small items through large cracks when
these soils dry. These cracks, which are often in excess of 5 cm and sometimes as wide as 10 cm
and up to 1.5 m deep, provide an expedient means by which artifacts may be transported to
considerable depth below surface. The expansion of wet clays imposes a prominent upward force
on large clasts in the soil, and if any are present at depth, they may be pushed to the surface.

Sandy Soils
These deposits are probably associated with ancient Pleistocene channel deposits, and some may
have been reworked by wind. The spatial distribution of the sandy deposits includes all upland
areas not devoid of the Lake Charles soils mapped by Miller (1982) (see Figure 4), with the
exception of the incised alluvial valleys. Aronow (1982), in particular, argues that the tops of
these sandy soils have been substantially moved around by wind, although it is very difficult to
demonstrate this with field evidence alone. The sandy facies deposits typically exhibit welldeveloped alfisols, with A-Bt-Bk horizons, and the subsoils appear to have experienced a wide
range of reduction (gleying) as a result of periodic seasonal saturation. The subsoils of the sandy
facies deposits typically exhibit evidence of pedogenic overprinting associated with alternating
wet and dry moisture regimes and often display attributes associated with climates drier than
today (during which time calcium carbonate accumulated in the B horizon) and periods wetter
than today (evidence of prolonged saturation in the form of gleying, and the formation of ironmanganese concretions). Although none of the extant geological maps appears to distinguish
these sandy deposits, their spatial location can be approximated by the location of soils with
sandy epipedons, such as the Telferner, Faddin, Dacosta, and Edna series as mapped by Miller
(1982).

HYDROLOGY
The uplands of the project site are drained by two low-order streams, Dry Kuy Creek and Kuy
Creek. Kuy Creek is mostly outside the project site, except for one small segment in the
southernmost point. The central portion of the project site is drained by Dry Kuy Creek, which is
a tributary of Kuy Creek. These two streams join together shortly before flowing into the San
Antonio River about 5 kilometers (km) southeast of the project site. Within the APE are two
main branches of Dry Kuy Creek: East Dry Kuy and West Dry Kuy. Both the east and west
16

branches of Dry Kuy Creek form incised valleys that gradually become wider in the downstream
direction. In the upstream direction (northwest), the creek floodplains are broad, shallow, panlike features that lack significant alluvial deposits.
Along the eastern edge of the APE is the margin of the Guadalupe River valley. This landscape
consists of a complex series of scarps and slopes at the break between the Pleistocene upland and
the Guadalupe River valley floor. The margin occupies a transition in elevation from 60–70 ft at
the edge of the upland valley wall to 10–15 ft on the floodplain of the Guadalupe River valley.
Numerous low-order incised streams drain the Guadalupe escarpment. Linn Lake and several
bayous lie on the valley floor between the APE and the Guadalupe River channel.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project site can be characterized generally as subtropical humid (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). Data from a local climate monitoring station (Southern Regional Climate Center
[SRCC] 2008) show an average daily maximum temperature of 80°F, with an all-time maximum
of 111°F in 2000, and an average daily minimum temperature of 61°F, with an all-time low of
9°F in 1989. The mean wind speed throughout the year is 10 mph, with a record high of 83 mph
in 2003. Relative humidity in Victoria averages 76 percent but increases dramatically throughout
each night, rising from a 6:00 P.M. average of 60 percent and a 6:00 A.M. average of 91 percent.
Precipitation averages 40 inches per year, with a 24-hour record of 10 inches in 1991, and
snowfall is negligible (SRCC 2008).

FLORA
According to the TPWD broad-scale map, Vegetation Types of Texas (Frye et al. 1984), the
project site lies within the bluestem grassland vegetation type (Figure 5). The project site is
bordered by cropland on the west and marsh barrier island on the east. Common plants in the
project site include bushy bluestem, slender bluestem, little bluestem, silver bluestem, three-awn,
buffalograss, bermudagrass, brownseed paspalum, single-spike paspalum, smutgrass, sacahuista,
windmillgrass, southern dewberry, live oak, mesquite, huisache, baccharis, and Macartney rose
(Frye et al. 1984).
GMI biologist Christie Hoffmeyer further refined the vegetation profile for the APE via published
literature, maps, and infrared aerial photography, supplemented by road-based field survey.
Vegetation communities observed in the field include Oat-Bluestem Prairie, BluestemWindmillgrass-Mesquite Prairie, Mesquite-Oak Shrubland, Oat-Windmillgrass-Paspalum
Prairie/Scrubland, Live Oak Woodland, Mesquite-Guajillo Shrubland, Flatsedge-Paspalum
Prairie, Mesquite-Huisache, Paspalum-Mesquite Prairie, Prairie Wetland, and Deciduous
Woodland (see Figure 5). Individual species observed within each vegetation community are
presented in Table 2.
Most of the vegetation in the APE is at or near the climax vegetation, defined by Miller (1982:43)
as “the stabilized plant community that reproduces itself and changes very little so long as the
environment remains unchanged,” or in other words, “the plants that grew there when [the area]
was first settled.” All vegetation communities appear to have some sort of past disturbance;
however, the land seemed to be in good to excellent condition. The least disturbed vegetation

FAUNA
Victoria County is home to a variety of animal species. Mammals include whitetail deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor Canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.). Birds residing in the area include herons (Ardea spp.), ducks (Anas
spp.), geese (Branta spp.), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), hawks (Accipiter spp.), and owls
(Strigidae spp.). Several species of snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles are among the reptiles and
amphibians living within Victoria County. Some of the aquatic species native to the county are
gar (Lepisosteus spp.), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), eel (Anguilla spp.), clam (Rangia
cuneata), eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and several mussel species (McGuff 1978;
White et al. 1989).

RESOURCE POTENTIAL
The Guadalupe River and to a lesser extent, the nearby uplands, provided a wide range of
resources useful to indigenous hunter-gatherers. The climate was generally warm to hot, with
relatively low levels of rainfall. Even though few natural caves and shelters were present, the
climate did not typically require tremendous investments in constructing substantial buildings.
Water was abundant in the Guadalupe River channel and associated bayous and small lakes.
Much of the vegetation tended to be thorny, but this does not seem to have been a major
impediment to human movement; after all, Cabeza de Vaca traversed the area in the 1530s in a
nearly naked state of dress (Krieger 2002).
Generally, prehistoric sites are found near water rather than in dry upland contexts (Ricklis 2004).
The Pleistocene-age Deweyville terraces discussed previously under Geology and
Geomorphology would have provided excellent settlement locations as sea (and river) levels rose
throughout the early and middle Holocene, reaching modern ranges approximately 3,000 years
ago (Paine 1991). The Pleistocene terraces along the Guadalupe River valley escarpment also
provided cobbles of workable lithic material such as chert. Stone tools knapped from these
cobbles were used to harvest a variety of plant resources, including reeds for basketry and wood
for sandals, shelters, tools, and other items. Given that few grinding implements have been
recovered from prehistoric sites in the area, it seems likely that edible legume beans and pods
were pounded in wooden mortar and pestles. Stone cobbles also served as heating elements in
stone boiling or griddle cooking activities; other stones were used as heating elements in hearths
for a wide range of activities.
The region also has a great diversity of animals, as discussed previously under Fauna. Many of
the larger animals could have been hunted using atlatl darts, spears, and later by bows and arrows;
the smaller game might have been caught in wooden snares or deadfalls. After meat and hides
were removed, animal bones provided the raw materials for various tools and ornaments such as
pins and beads. Riparian, lacustrine, and estuarine environments along the Guadalupe River
floodplain would have provided abundant resources, including various varieties of shellfish and
finfish. Downstream at Guadalupe Bay, shell middens demonstrate a continuous subsistence
focus on local mollusks from Archaic through Historic times (Weinstein and Scott 1992), as well
as utilization of fish with breeding cycles dependent on estuarine salinity fluctuations (Ricklis
2004). In addition to nutrients, mollusks also provided shells that could be made into scrapers or
ground into fragments for use as ceramic temper in the Late Prehistoric period (although it must
21

be said that the clays in the immediate study area often include a sandy fraction that serves as a
natural temper, obviating the need for additional temper material).
Spanish Colonial settlers used the local prairies and floodplains for cattle and sheep ranching, and
also built a dam and associated irrigation system for maize agriculture on the Guadalupe River
southeast of the project area (Morris 1953). The settlers maintained their connections with
economies in Mexico, bringing in majolica ceramics, as well as metal implements. Early
transportation routes probably mirrored aboriginal trails as horse-drawn wagons expanded the
range of goods brought to the region. Initial structures were probably made of adobe brick or
wattle and daub materials made from locally available trees.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

INTRODUCTION
Based on early taxonomic divisions within coastal archaeology (Ambler 1967; Aten 1983;
Campbell 1960), the Texas Gulf Coast has been divided into three basic zones: upper, central,
and lower coasts (Figure 6). This review of prehistory and history will only include the central
Texas coast in general, and more specifically, it will focus on the current project site and the
surrounding region within a 20-mile radius. The central Texas coast is most commonly discussed
as extending from the Colorado River south to the northern reaches of Baffin Bay (Ricklis 2004).
This area includes the barrier islands and coastal fringes and continues inland for approximately
25 miles. The central Texas coast has survived as a useful geographical unit because its
geomorphology, namely its five estuarine bay systems, has produced rather unique and bounded
assemblages from at least the Late Archaic period (1,150 B.C–1000 A.D.).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Professional archaeological investigations throughout the lower Guadalupe River valley date back
to the early 1930s. However, recent work in the valley has focused primarily on the construction
and upgrading of the Victoria Barge Canal. Only one archaeological excavation has been
undertaken within the project site boundary; the remainder are all located to the north and east
along the Victoria Barge Canal and the Guadalupe River (Figure 7).
A. M. Woolsey was the first to professionally survey sections of the Guadalupe River valley in
1932 (Campbell 1976; Weinstein 1992). Woolsey’s work included surveys of the lower
Guadalupe River from San Antonio Bay to Green Lake, recording and testing a series of shell
midden sites (Weinstein 1992). At that time, Woolsey also surveyed and tested the Morhiss
Mound (41VT1) site along the Guadalupe River, just north of Coleto Creek (Campbell 1976).
Further excavation of Morhiss Mound was performed as part of a 16-month Works Progress
Administration (WPA) project that began in 1938 (W. A. Duffen 1940).

23

Modern professional work in the 20-mile project region began in 1973 with a study of the effects
of shell dredging on the cultural resources of San Antonio Bay (Comstock et al. 1973). In the late
1970s, Frank Hole (1978, 1979) located a series of shell midden sites along the north shore of
Green Lake, many of which included burials. In 1982, as part of a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District, reconnaissance, Carolyn Murphy recorded a series of sites along
the Victoria Barge Canal, including the Buckeye Knoll (41VT98) site (Weinstein 1992). The
only previous archaeological work undertaken within the current project site occurred in 1985, as
part of a University of Texas, San Antonio, field school investigating the Eagles Roost (41VT80)
and Linn Lake (41VT81) sites (Hester 1985). The Eagles Roost site yielded Late Prehistoric
material, and Late Prehistoric and Historic contexts were recorded from Linn Lake (Hester 1985).
In 1988, Coastal Environments, Inc., began survey work along approximately 16 km of the
Victoria Barge Canal, recording six shell middens and three lithic scatters (Weinstein 1992).
Weinstein’s work also included the testing of seven sites adjacent to the canal: Taylor Ranch site
(41CL1), Guadalupe Bay site (41CL2), 41CL59, 41CL70, 41CL74, Buckeye Knoll (41VT98),
and 41VT99 (Weinstein 1992). With the exception of sites 41CL74 and 41VT99, all of these
sites were reported to contain cultural material dating to the Archaic through Late Prehistoric
periods (Weinstein 1992). Coastal Environments undertook data recovery work at the Guadalupe
Bay site in 1992, reporting a stratified shell midden dating from the Late Archaic to Early
Historic periods (Weinstein and Scott 1992).
Survey work for proposed dredge disposal areas along the barge canal was performed by Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., in 1993 and resulted in the recording of two new sites and revisiting nine
previously recorded sites to determine their condition and make recommendations regarding
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (Gadus et al. 1993).
More recent work by Prewitt and Associates occurred from 1995–1998 as part of the proposed
widening of the Victoria Barge Canal (Gadus et al. 1999). Test excavations were carried out at
six sites, and three (41CL9, 41CL77, and 41CL78) were recommended eligible for listing in the
NRHP (Gadus et al. 1999).
After initial testing in 1989, the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98) underwent continued
testing/mitigation excavation by Coastal Environments in 2000. Directed by Robert Ricklis, the
continued work at Buckeye Knoll involved the excavation of a large prehistoric cemetery
(approximately 75 individuals) in addition to extensive cultural deposits dating from the Early
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods (Ricklis n.d.). Detailed published reports of the Buckeye
Knoll excavations are still forthcoming.
In February of 2008, Geo-Marine, Inc., performed Phase Ia investigations of the 11,500-acre
Victoria County Station site (Peter and Prior 2008). These investigations included the
development of prehistoric and historic contexts, as well as geoarchaeological investigations to
characterize the nature of the landscape and to define the potential context of archaeological
deposits (surficial or buried) within different portions of the site. The Victoria County Station
site was found to consist of two distinct landscapes, the Pleistocene uplands and the Guadalupe
River valley margin, each with a different probability for cultural remains. The Guadalupe River
valley margin was found to have the highest potential for both prehistoric and historic period
cultural materials. Based on these findings, a survey strategy for Phase Ib investigations of the
2,954-acre survey area was proposed (Peter and Prior 2008) and later accepted by the Texas
Historic Commission (THC).

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Thomas N. Campbell (1960) was the first to fully synthesize the archaeology of the Texas central
and lower coasts. Using information from many of his own excavations within Copano Bay and
Laguna Madre, along with other existing yet sparse information, Campbell created a basic twopart chronology: the pre-ceramic Archaic Aransas focus, followed by the Late Prehistoric
Rockport focus. These taxonomic designations were created using artifact typologies and
apparent stratigraphic relationships without the assistance of radiocarbon dating techniques.
Since Campbell’s (1960) synthesis, there has been a tremendous increase in the number and
complexity of archaeological research projects along the central Texas coast. The vast majority
of this research in recent decades has been carried out as cultural resources management projects.
Many attempts have been made to organize the large amount of archaeological data from this
region into a cultural chronology that is both generally accepted and integrates well with adjacent
areas. As part of a review of south Texas archaeology, including the coast, Stephen L. Black
(1989) created a taxonomic cultural sequence for the central coast. Black’s elaborate system of
“phases” is a significant expansion of Campbell’s simplistic two-part chronology. In Black’s
system, there are eight phases from just the Late Archaic to Historic periods. Richard Weinstein
(1992) further expanded Black’s work, but cultural chronologies for the central Texas coast are
still the focus of much debate and little agreement (cf. Ricklis 2004).
In order to avoid debates of taxonomy, the current review will use a simple chronological
framework when discussing the indigenous archaeology of the central Texas coast (Table 3).
This chronology includes the Paleo-Indian (ca. 9,200–5,500 B.C.), Early Archaic (ca. 5,500–2,200
B.C.), Middle Archaic (ca. 2,200–1,100 B.C.), Late Archaic (ca. 1,100 B.C.–A.D. 1000), Late
Prehistoric (A.D. 1000–1700), and Early Historic (A.D. 1700–1800) periods.

Paleo-Indian (ca. 9200–5500 B.C.)
The Texas coastal region underwent dramatic changes in geomorphology throughout the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene. By the peak of glaciation within the Pleistocene (ca. 20,000
B.C.), sea levels were at least 100 m below current levels. Global warming trends ca. 18,000
years ago triggered sea level increases, which by 9,000 years ago allowed for the initial formation
of the modern bay systems of the central Texas coast (Brown et al. 1976; McGowan et al. 1976).
Sea levels continued rising throughout the early Holocene and did not approximate modern levels
until ca. 1,050 B.C. (Anderson et al. 1992; Brown et al. 1976; McGowan et al. 1976; Paine 1991).
The shallow water estuary/barrier island chain systems characteristic of the central Texas coast
began to approximate their modern forms during the end of the Middle Archaic Period ca. 3,000
years ago (Paine 1991).
Due to the dynamic nature of the Texas coast during the early Holocene, evidence of Paleo-Indian
archaeology is sparse on the central Texas coast and primarily consists of isolated, scattered finds.
Site 41VT112 is the only stratified site with Paleo-Indian components within the 20-mile project
region. Although some Paleo-Indian projectile points (Golondrina, Angostura and Plainview)
were recovered from the Morhiss Mound (41VT1) excavations of the 1930s, they were from
mixed contexts and provide little more data than the stray finds typified by site 41VT85 along the
Guadalupe River (Campbell 1976:84–85).

Early Archaic (ca. 5500–2200 B.C.)
For the first two millennia of the Early Archaic, sea levels continued to slowly rise, and the active
channels of the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers were still below their current depths (Pearson
et al. 1986). Phytolith data indicate that throughout the Early Archaic period the environment
underwent a gradual transition to drier conditions (Robinson 1979). Given the amount of general
geomorphological and climatic change occurring throughout the Early Archaic, it has been
difficult for archaeologists to locate occupations dating to this period. In spite of two notable
exceptions, intact sites attributed to the Early Archaic are rare for the central Texas coast. The
two exceptions, the Morhiss Mound site (41VT1) and the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), are both
located within the 20-mile project region.

Morhiss Mound Site (41VT1)
When first investigated in 1932, the 300 x 400-ft mound was over 20 ft in height. A. T. Jackson,
and later his assistant, A. M. Woolsey, began initial trenching of the site in 1932. This initial
work resulted in the recovery of 10 human burials, Pleistocene fauna, and a range of artifacts
(Campbell 1976). Although later determined to be a natural Pleistocene (Deweyville) terrace,
Jackson believed the mound was anthropogenic in origin and should be more thoroughly
excavated.
As part of a WPA excavation, Morhiss Mound was once again investigated for a total of 16
months from 1938–1940 under the direction of W. A. Duffen (1940). Duffen’s large WPA crews
often totaled more than 30 individuals, and they were able to excavate the entire mound, resulting
in the removal of 5,000 five-foot-square units. As methods of the day were crude, the excavated
material presently has little useful contextual information. Additionally, the excavation in its
29

entirety has never been properly published, and current knowledge of the site is limited to a few
specialists’ reports (e.g., Dockall and Dockall 1996). However, approximately 7,000 artifacts and
200 human burials were recovered from the WPA excavation. Although no formal absolute
dating has been carried out on organics from Morhiss Mound, lithics have provided one of the
few glimpses into its chronology. The Early Archaic period is represented at Morhiss Mound in
the form of Gower, Hoxie, and Victoria diagnostic projectile points (Campbell 1976).

The Buckeye Knoll Site (41VT98)
Located adjacent to the Victoria Barge Canal, site 41VT98 is situated atop a surviving
Pleistocene terrace (Beaumont Formation). The large site was first identified by E. Vogt in the
1960s, but professional work did not begin at the site until the late 1980s when the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, initiated testing of several sites along the Victoria Barge
Canal (Weinstein 1992). Testing of site 41VT98 revealed stratified deposits in excess of 2.5 m
deep beginning with the Early Archaic period (Weinstein 1992). Additional testing began in
November 2000 under the direction of Ricklis, and although results have yet to be published,
initial reports indicate the presence of approximately 75 human burials dating to the Early
Archaic, along with significant amounts of faunal material and other cultural remains (Ricklis
n.d.).
Although intact archaeological deposits dating to the Early Archaic are rare for the central Texas
coast, it is significant to note that both Buckeye Knoll and Morhiss Mound are located within the
20-mile project region. These two sites both occupy remnant Pleistocene terrace formations that
would have provided natural protection in the floodplain of the Guadalupe River system during a
time of sea level rise. As the central Texas coast continued to transform to its modern
configuration throughout the Early Archaic, Pleistocene terrace remnants would have not only
provided natural protection but also a higher probability of preserving archaeological deposits.

Middle Archaic (ca. 2200–1100 B.C.)
Sites with Middle Archaic components are slightly more numerous than previous periods. It has
been suggested that by this time, the San Antonio estuary system would have extended farther
north than in previous periods (Prewitt and Paine 1988; Weinstein 1992). Dated oyster reef
deposits collected three miles north of Green Lake indicate that by the end of the Middle Archaic,
productive estuary resource systems were well established for the lower Guadalupe River valley
(Weinstein 1992).
As for prehistoric occupation during this period, both Morhiss Mound (41VT1) and Buckeye
Knoll (41VT98) contain diagnostic Middle Archaic projectile point types. Nolan, Travis,
Bulverde, Palmillas, Kent, and Tortugas types were recovered from Morhiss Mound (Campbell
1976). Both Bulverde and Kent Middle Archaic points were reported from the initial testing of
Buckeye Knoll (Weinstein 1992). Other probable Middle Archaic sites within the 20-mile project
region include Sentinel Oak (41VT79), Linn Lake (41VT81), Texas West Indies Ranch (41VT9),
and Eagles Roost (41VT80). The Linn Lake, Texas West Indies Ranch, and Eagles Roost sites
all are situated on the western edge of the Guadalupe River valley.

30

Like the Morhiss Mound and Buckeye Knoll sites, each of the other four sites in the 20-mile
project region with Middle Archaic components are all located on Pleistocene terrace remnants at
the river valley edge. The Texas West Indies Ranch site (41VT9) contained both an occupation
area and a possible Middle Archaic cemetery in which a Palmillas point was found in association
with one of the burials (Huebner 1988). Nearby Linn Lake (41VT81) has produced Tortugas and
Palmillas points, and Bulverde dart points were found at Eagles Roost (41VT80) (Hester 1985).
Lastly, Middle Archaic Refugio projectile points were recovered from Sentinel Oak (41VT79).
Both Blue Bayou (41VT94) and Sentinel Oak (41VT79) have been tentatively associated with the
Middle Archaic (Weinstein 1992).
With the gradual stabilization of sea levels and establishment of active estuary systems
throughout the Middle Archaic, the central Texas coast likely became a more predictable
environment for the procurement of marine and brackish-water fish and mollusks. Throughout
this and previous periods, Pleistocene terraces were the preferred locations for sites.

Late Archaic (ca. 1100 B.C.–A.D. 1000)
The number of archaeological sites attributed to the Late Archaic period on the central Texas
coast is substantially greater than for previous periods. The reasons for the dramatic increase in
number of known sites for this time period are still uncertain. However, it has been suggested the
combination of sea level stabilization, increase in river sediments, and the gradual formation of
Matagorda Island would have acted to reduce salinity of the San Antonio Bay system, thereby
increasing the productivity of oysters and other estuarine resources (Nelson and Bray 1970;
Pearson et al. 1986) and leading to an increase in the population of people. Concomitantly,
evidence of Late Archaic subsistence is dominated by fish species—black drum, redfish, spotted
sea trout, and Atlantic croaker—whose yearly cycle is tied to estuary bay systems (Ricklis 2004).
In addition to the increased reliance upon estuarine resources, the archaeology of the Late
Archaic reveals a diverse shell tool industry and evidence of basketry (Campbell 1947, 1952;
Ricklis 1990, 2004). Although perforated oyster shell and edge-flaked clamshell scrapers are
known from the Early Archaic and continue to be found in later periods, the use of conch shell for
tools appears to begin only in the Late Archaic (Campbell 1952; Ricklis 1990, 2004).
Additionally, the number of bone artifacts (e.g., awls, socketed points) increases dramatically in
the archaeological record of the Late Archaic.
Within the 20-mile project region, Late Archaic occupations include both sites with earlier
contexts—Morhiss Mound (41VT1), Blue Bayou (41VT94), Buckeye Knoll (41VT98), Sentinel
Oak (41VT79), Linn Lake (41VT81), and Eagles Roost (41VT80)—as well as numerous sites
upstream along the Guadalupe River and Coleto Creek and downstream adjacent to Green Lake.
From Morhiss Mound, Late Archaic diagnostic material has included Morhiss, Marshall, Lange,
Marcos, Darl, Ensor, and Fairland projectile points (Campbell 1976; Suhm and Krieger 1954).
Campbell (1976) suggests that the majority of the burials from Morhiss Mound were interred
during the Late Archaic period. Castroville, Marcos, Darl, and Fairland points were reported
from the Sentinel Oak, Linn Lake, and Eagles Roost sites, suggesting similar components among
sites along the western edge of the Guadalupe River valley (Weinstein 1992). Sites adjacent to
Green Lake revealed Late Archaic diagnostics, and both sites 41CL1 and 41CL62 contained shell
middens that gradually changed composition from mixed oyster and clam (Rangia) to
predominantly Rangia (Weinstein 1992). This transition in taxa is cited as evidence of the
31

Guadalupe River shifting to a more western course away from Green Lake, which in turn led to
more brackish conditions in the lake.
As the central Texas coast estuary bay systems began to increase their biotic productivity
throughout the Late Archaic, areas such as the lower Guadalupe River valley possibly began to
offer more opportunities for prehistoric activities. In addition to the continued use of existing site
locations (e.g., Morhiss Mound and Buckeye Knoll) in the 20-mile project region during the Late
Archaic, other areas (both upriver and downriver) were for the first time associated with
significant increases in archaeology. The increase in both the number of sites and use of
estuarine resources is a trend that continues into the Late Prehistoric period.

Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1700)
Using a socio-cultural evolutionary taxonomic system, the end of the Late Archaic period on the
central Texas coast, like the remainder of the state, is signaled by the widespread adoption of the
bow and arrow and ceramics (Hester 1975, 1981; Suhm and Krieger 1954). Based on changes in
artifact types and suspected shifts in subsistence practices, the Late Prehistoric period for the
central Texas coast is divided into Initial Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1250/1300) and Final
Late Prehistoric ( ca. A.D. 1250/1300–1700) phases (Ricklis 2004).
The Initial Late Prehistoric phase along the central Texas coast is characterized by Scallorn and
Fresno arrow points along with plain, sandy paste ceramics similar to Goose Creek of the upper
Texas coast (Ricklis 2004; Weinstein 1992). By the Final Late Prehistoric phase, Perdiz arrow
points predominate along with a prismatic blade technology, thin bifacial knives, and Rockport
sandy paste ceramics (Fritz 1975; Ricklis 1996). Rockport ceramics are quite distinctive because
many have asphaltum decorations and were produced in a variety of shapes (e.g., bowls, jars, and
ollas) (Ricklis 1996).
Fishing continued to be a major focus of subsistence in the Late Prehistoric period and was
possibly of even greater importance than in the Late Archaic (Ricklis 1990, 1996; Weinstein
1992). At several sites (e.g., 41CL2) along the central Texas coast, Late Prehistoric fish-rich
middens are stratigraphically above Late Archaic shell middens, suggesting a possible shift in
resource selection (Weinstein 1992). Additionally, by A.D. 1250/1300, bison became a significant
resource for the region as numerous upland hunting camps, such as 41RF21, have been dated to
this period (Ricklis 1989, 1990, 1996).
The abundance of subsistence data gathered from Late Prehistoric sites has made it possible to
address issues of seasonality and group migration. Analysis of fish otolith data from large
shoreline sites has shown that the most important species (black drum and redfish) were collected
during the fall through early spring periods (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1996). Additional data from
Rangia cuneata shells in river margin sites have revealed late spring through summer occupations
(Aten 1981; Carlson 1988; Ricklis 2004). Collectively, these data along with site size
information suggest large aggregations of groups occurred during the fall and winter months
along the coast, followed by a late spring and summer dispersal of smaller groups into upland
river margin settings. Ricklis (1990, 1992, 1996), using archival sources, has suggested similar
seasonality patterns existed within the early historic period Karankawa along the central Texas
coast.

32

Within the 20-mile project region, Late Prehistoric sites occupy a range of settings from the upper
reaches of San Antonio Bay to just north of Victoria along the Guadalupe River. Some of the
major sites from earlier periods (e.g., Morhiss Mound [41VT1], Sentinel Oak [41VT79], Buckeye
Knoll [41VT98]) have very small Late Prehistoric components, but others (e.g., Linn Lake
[41VT81] and Blue Bayou [41VT94]) either continued at earlier size/use or took on greater
significance during the Late Prehistoric period (Weinstein 1992). The larger sites for this period
appear to be near the coast and appear to have operated as large aggregation centers for winter
fishing. One such aggregation center is the Guadalupe Bay (41CL2) site. Although first
established in the Late Archaic, the Guadalupe Bay site has a significant Late Prehistoric
component composed of Rockport ceramics, Fresno arrow points, and large amounts of faunal
material. Smaller sites for this period are those located upstream along upland settings, often at
the river margin. Many of the smaller upland sites are indicative of hunting camps such as the
Mellon site (41RF21) which yielded concentrations of deer and bison bone (Ricklis 2004).
Settlement patterns appear to have changed by the Late Prehistoric, whereby the larger sites
upstream along the river margin such as Buckeye Knoll and Morhiss Mound were largely
abandoned, as large aggregation sites along the coastal edge, such as Guadalupe Bay, became
prevalent. At the same time that upland sites such as Morhiss Mound were falling out of use,
many more were being created upstream along the river margin as short-term hunting/fishing
camps. In some cases, sites that were active in earlier periods such as Linn Lake appear to be the
focus of hunting and possible trade activities well into the historic period (Hester 1985; Weinstein
1992).

Early Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700–1800)
The current review is limited to the earliest component of the established historic record and
focuses solely on sites with primarily indigenous components. Sites meeting these criteria are
few, but they do extend the length of the 20-mile project region along the Guadalupe River
valley. Subsistence and seasonality data from the early Historic Period is severely lacking and
currently restricts our understanding of indigenous adaptation for the central Texas coast during
the first few centuries of European interaction. Although widely dispersed, each of the sites
discussed below represents indigenous interaction with colonial Spanish interests along the
central Texas coast.
Beginning just north of Victoria along the Guadalupe River, site 41VT13 represents the remnants
of an early eighteenth-century dam and irrigation canal reportedly built by Aranama Indians
(TARL site form). Farther south, multicomponent sites Blue Bayou (41VT94) and Linn Lake
(41VT81) both contain early European artifacts; additionally, a glass Guerrero point was found at
Linn Lake (Hester 1985). Downstream in the Green Lake vicinity, Spanish artifacts have been
recovered at several sites (41CL77, 41CL7, and 41CL2) that are believed to have been associated
with the late eighteenth-century Mission Nuestra Señora de Refugio or one of its associated
ranches. Although the original location of this mission is not known, it is has been suggested that
site 41CL10 may in fact represent its eighteenth-century location (Henson 1992).

33

HISTORIC CONTEXT

European Exploration and Settlement
The first European explorers reached the vicinity now encompassed by Victoria County during
the early sixteenth century. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, traversed the area but made
no attempt at permanent settlement. More than a century later, in 1685, René Robert Cavelier,
Sieur de La Salle, established Fort St. Louis, on behalf of France, on the west bank of Garcitas
Creek. The Spanish government soon took exception to French encroachments in the Gulf Coast
area. On 14 April 1689, Alonso de León discovered the Guadalupe River while on a mission
from the Spanish government to find and destroy Fort St. Louis. Father Damián Massanet, who
accompanied the expedition, named the river in honor of the patron saint of Mexico. De León
ultimately discovered that Fort St. Louis had been abandoned, with its colonists fallen victim
either to disease or to armed engagements with local Native American tribes (Morris 1953:n.p.;
Roell 1990a:126).
In 1722, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, built on the ruins of Fort St. Louis at Garcitas Creek,
marked the first Spanish settlement in what became Victoria County. On the east bank of the
creek in what is now Jackson County, Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (La
Bahía) was established (Morris 1953:n.p.), but both the mission and presidio were moved to the
Guadalupe River in August 1726. The Spanish built a dam across the river and added an
irrigation system to supply nearby agricultural fields. The area around the mission became
known as Mission Valley, an appellation it has retained (Morris 1953:n.p.). The mission and
presidio moved again in 1749, this time to the San Antonio River in present-day Goliad County.
Despite the relocations, the settlers enjoyed stability and prosperity by cultivating crops and
producing enough hay and corn to export their surplus to San Antonio and settlements in East
Texas. The mission also raised livestock, and an 1858 inventory listed 3,220 branded cattle, 120
horses, and 1,600 sheep (Roell 1990a:126).
After La Bahía moved to the San Antonio River in 1749, no further permanent settlement
occurred in Victoria County other than isolated individual holdings, such as Carlos de la Garza’s
rancho at Anaqua and Margaret Wright’s homestead at Mission Valley (Roell 1990a:126). In
1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain. The newly formed Mexican government
retained control over the vast holdings in what is now the American Southwest, including Texas.
Three years later, Don Martín de León successfully petitioned the Mexican government to
establish a colony on the Texas gulf coastal plain. The colony encompassed all of the territory of
present-day Victoria and Calhoun counties, as well as parts of Lavaca, Jackson, and DeWitt
counties. The center of government for the colony was the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de
Jesús Victoria settlement. Soon known as Guadalupe Victoria, the community prospered, with a
population of approximately 300 in 1834. For the colony as a whole, over 100 titles to land
grants had been issued by the Mexican government by 1835. Early General Land Office maps of
present-day Victoria County show land grants patented in the 1830s to numerous individuals with
Spanish surnames. Within and near the project area, headrights abutting the Guadalupe River
were patented to Juan Gonzales, Leonardo Rodriguez, Desiderio Nira, Francisco Ramón, Maria
Josefia Traviese, and José Valdez (GLO Maps 1858:n.d; Hammonds 1999:7.; Roell 1990a:126–
127; Shook 1990:113).

34

The Texas Revolution began the following year. Victoria and the nearby town of Goliad were
crucial points in the 1836 Texas Revolution. Goliad was the later name of the former Spanish
presidio La Bahía, and it stood 26 miles west of the town of Victoria. Representing the
northeastern point of defense for the Texas revolution, James W. Fannin, Jr., commanded 500
soldiers at Goliad. While determining what move to make in support of the revolution in early
1836, Fannin received orders from Maj. Gen. Sam Houston to march to San Antonio to assist the
Texan soldiers at the Alamo. Houston soon rescinded the orders, however, and commanded
Fannin to meet with other troops in Victoria. Fannin, concerned that Goliad might be attacked,
did not leave immediately. When he finally headed his troops toward Victoria, they soon
encountered Gen. José de Urrea of the Mexican Army. Outnumbered, Fannin surrendered,
believing that his troops would be treated properly as prisoners of war. He and his troops were
marched back to Goliad, however, whereupon Mexican President Santa Anna ordered their
execution (Handbook of Texas Online, “Texas Revolution”).
After the declaration of Texas independence, Victoria County stood among the original 23
counties established by the First Congress of the Republic of Texas in March 1836, and three
years later, the city of Victoria became the third city to receive a formal charter by the republic.
John J. Linn, an Irish immigrant and member of one of the original 41 families of Guadalupe
Victoria, served as a delegate to the convention in which Texas declared its independence and
established the Republic of Texas. Linn not only served in the republic’s congress and helped to
draft the new nation’s constitution, but was Victoria’s first mayor (Hammonds 1999:11; Roell
1990a:127; Shook 1990:113). Although the de Leóns and other Hispanic settlers in Guadalupe
Victoria supported the Texans in their bid for independence, most were ostracized after the war
and forced to flee. Anglo-Americans eventually resettled the area (Hammonds 1999:9, 11–12;
Roell 1990a:127; Shook 1990:113).
After Texas voters approved an annexation ordinance and state constitution, Texas joined the
United States in 1845, with formal transfer of government taking place the following February.
The same year, the Texas legislature settled conflicting territorial claims among Victoria, La
Vaca, Jackson, and Calhoun counties, and Victoria County’s boundaries were finalized to its
present configuration (Roell 1990a:127).

Nineteenth-century Development
Victoria County was a crossroads for southern Texas long before statehood had been established.
A cart road ran from the port at Indianola to San Antonio and New Braunfels, and the old Goliad
Road went from east to west. Located alongside the Guadalupe River, the city of Victoria strove
to secure its position as a trade center. In 1840, the county commissioners approved rates for a
municipal ferry across the river. A toll bridge, built by Richard Owens and Sylvester Sutton,
followed in 1851 (Roell 1990a:127).
Both Kemper’s Bluff and White’s Ferry, also in Victoria County, posed the most serious
competition to Victoria as trade centers and embarkation points (Roell 1990a:127). Situated
along the Guadalupe River, Kemper’s Bluff stood north of the present site of the McFaddin
community, while nearby White’s Ferry was a short distance southeast and downriver at the
confluence of the Guadalupe and Old rivers.

The competition among the river towns reflected the Guadalupe River’s early supremacy in
creating trade routes. The 255-mile river rises in Kerr County and flows into the San Antonio
Bay, and its tributaries include the Blanco, Comal, and San Marcos streams. The Guadalupe
joins the San Antonio River at the southeast corner of Victoria County (Morris 1953:n.p.). The
legislature of Coahuila and Texas attempted to improve the river’s navigability in 1828, 1833,
and 1835, but the Texas revolution foiled these efforts. The Republic of Texas authorized
improvements in 1840, and Victoria devoted one-fourth of the proceeds from the sale of its public
lands for this purpose. The Texas state legislature authorized further work in 1853 (Morris
1953:n.p.; Roell 1990a:127).
Construction of the San Antonio & Mexican Gulf Railroad from Victoria to Port Lavaca in 1861
marked the beginning of the end of river dominance in transportation. During the Civil War,
Confederate General John B. Magruder rendered the Guadalupe River impassable by sinking
boats and trees to prevent Federal troops from using the waterway. Magruder ordered the railroad
tracks torn up as well, but these were rebuilt immediately after the war. The Guadalupe River, on
the other hand, fell out of use until the 1880s. Storm and flood damage to the port town of
Indianola in 1875 and 1886 further hampered efforts to resume river commerce (Morris
1953:n.p.; Roell 1990a:128).
Victoria County voted for secession in 1861 and approximately 300 male residents served with
the Confederate army. Camp Henry E. McCulloch was established about 4 miles from Victoria
under the command of Colonel R. R. Garland. The county also functioned as a transportation,
military, and supply center through the early years of the Civil War. The city of Victoria stood on
the Cotton Road, which provided access to guns, ammunition, medicine, and supplies from
Mexico in exchange for crops. Confederate troops withdrew from the area following Magruder’s
order in 1863 to destroy navigation on the Guadalupe River and the tracks of the San Antonio &
Mexican Gulf railroad (Hammonds 1999:14–15; Victoria Sesquicentennial, Inc. 1974:51).
Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley arrived in July 1865 with Federal troops to occupy the city, thus
beginning the Reconstruction period. In addition to ruined transportation routes, the county
suffered extensive economic losses as a result of the Civil War, with the value of all property
declining from $3,088,476 in 1860 to $1,503,295 in 1870. The 1860 property enumeration
included considerable value that was embodied by the county’s 1,413 slaves while the 1870s
census did not include slaves as property (Hammonds 1999:14-15; Roell 1990a:128).
The agricultural economy that had depended on slave labor for much of its profitability had to be
reconstituted. For the short term, labor-intensive cotton was abandoned in favor of raising cattle
and other livestock. Production figures for 1870 showed that only 205 bales of cotton were
produced, while the number of cattle grew to 61,651 (Roell 1990a:129). A growing
manufacturing base also developed, with the number of manufacturing establishments increasing
from 10 to 25 by 1870. Reflective of the local agricultural economy, one of the area’s first meatpacking plants was established in 1869. An ample labor supply could be drawn from freed
African Americans, migrants from other parts of the United States, and European immigrants.
Since the 1840s, German immigrants had been arriving in Victoria County, many of them lured
by the German Immigration Society and seeking relief from the revolutions and oppression of
their native country. Italians provided a substantial portion of the labor for railroad construction
and often settled permanently in Victoria (Hammonds 1999:11; Roell 1990a:127, 129; Shook
1990:115).

36

Victoria’s strategic geographic location and transportation routes provided the basis for the
county’s economic resurgence after Reconstruction ended. The city’s bridge across the
Guadalupe River was rebuilt as early as 1865 by Jessie Obadiah Wheeler. By 1873, the Gulf,
Western Texas & Pacific Railroad connected Victoria with Cuero and the coast, and in 1882, the
New York, Texas & Mexican Railroad provided the first cross-country route. These lines, as well
as the old Goliad and Indianola roads and the city’s status as county seat, made Victoria the
logical focal point for shipping and commercial activity for both Victoria and surrounding
counties (Hammonds 1999:15; Roell 1990a:129). Improved transportation also spurred more
development in the city. For example, in 1882, A. de Rollepot established an ice manufactory in
Victoria. Local ranchers seized on the opportunity, and the following year, James McFaddin,
along with Thomas M. O’Connor, G. A. Levi, Leo N. Levi, J. M. Mathis, Tobe Wood, and others,
founded the Texas Continental Meat Company. With a capital of $1 million, the joint stock
company’s mission was to use the manufactured ice to run refrigerated train cars filled with fresh
meat to eastern cities (Petty 1961:75–76).

Cattle Ranching in Victoria County
In Victoria County, cattle ranching extended back to the days of Mission Espíritu Santo
established by the Spanish during the 1720s (Hammonds 1999:19; Roell 1990a:129; Wolff
1968a:365–366). The mission was located eight miles northwest of Victoria on the Guadalupe
River. By 1770, the ranch claimed 40,000 head of cattle (Wolff 1968a:366). The eighteenthcentury roots of cattle ranching earned Victoria County the nickname “Cradle of the Texas Cattle
Industry” (Hammonds 1999:19).
After Mexico achieved independence in 1821, the Spanish mission lands and cattle eventually fell
into the hands of European settlers. The settlers brought their own cattle with them, and crossbreeding between these and the Spanish cattle soon took place. The hybrids were known as
Texas Longhorns (Wolff 1968a:366–367). The cattle adapted quickly and easily to the natural
environment in southern Texas. Their numbers proliferated to a point that the local market was
saturated and local ranchers sought access to more distant venues.
Cattle drives were curtailed during the Civil War years. Among the area cattlemen who
completed wartime drives were Jim Borroum and Monroe Choate, who made a successful
journey to Mississippi with 800 head of cattle. In the boom period that followed the war’s end,
Victoria County ranchers joined the cattle drives on the famous Chisholm Trail to Kansas.
Thomas O’Connor, George W. Saunders, James A. McFaddin, Tobias D. Wood, Thomas Welder,
A. M. McFaddin, Dillard Fant, and Margaret Hardy-Borland ranked among the local ranchers
who participated. The journey lasted from two to four months with herds that typically numbered
3,000 cattle (Wolff 1968a:372–375).
During the 1870s, Victoria County ranchers followed statewide trends toward fencing pastures.
They initially used plank fences, but these were easily damaged by the severe storms that swept
up from the Gulf, and the lack of timber on the coastal plains made building materials scarce.
Barbed wire provided a more flexible and affordable approach to fencing. In 1875, the sons of
M. L. Stoner and the Thomas O’Connor ranch were among the first ranches in Victoria County to
add fencing to their pastures. James McFaddin followed suit during the early 1880s (Hammonds
1999:20; Hand 2000:101; Wolff 1968a:385–386).

37

In 1878, the Victoria newspaper, The Advocate, stated that Victoria County had 61,161 head of
cattle. Among the largest ranchers, James A. McFaddin owned 4,010 cattle, and the Stoner
Pasture Company had 2,000 head. McFaddin’s ranch comprised approximately 20,000 acres,
with David H. McFaddin serving as manager. Adjoining the ranch and lying alongside the San
Antonio River were the properties of E. M. Phelps, Captain J. T. Southwell, William Tom, and
Amanda Williams. On the Guadalupe River side of the McFaddin ranch, the Stoner pasture of
some 30,000 acres was located to the north. G. O. Stoner managed and resided at the ranch
(Wolff 1968a:388–389). By 1883, the number of cattle in Victoria County numbered 75,190,
with an estimated value of $1 million (Hammonds 1999:22). By the mid-1880s, Victoria
County’s total assessed property valuations reached $3,910,020, and cattle were assessed at
$1,001,702. A listing of the largest property owners included James A. McFaddin, with land
holdings worth $95,800; the Stoner Pasture Company, with $64,600; and Tobe Wood with
$16,620 (Wilson and Roell 1990:73; Wolff 1968a:356–357).

CONCLUSIONS
Although the body of knowledge regarding central Texas coast archaeology has grown greatly in
recent decades, it is still poorly understood overall. The prehistory of the region was intricately
tied to its slowly evolving estuary systems and resulting changes in biotic productivity. As sea
levels began to reach modern levels ca. 3,000 years ago, settlement along the central Texas coast
began to increase. This increase can also be seen within the 20-mile project region along the
Guadalupe River. In the Paleo-Indian and Early–Middle Archaic periods, sites predominate
along river margin settings. This trend increases through the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods, along with increased use of bay/shoreline localities as estuarine productivity develops.
Historically, settlement along the central coast was intrinsically tied to water courses such as the
Guadalupe River, much like the preceding prehistoric periods. Early Mission settlements and
later ranches and homesteaders were closely tied to the Guadalupe River and its tributary
systems.
For the current APE and archaeological survey area, there are no previously identified
archaeological sites. However nearby prehistoric sites are known along the river margin, just
west of the Guadalupe River. Middle Archaic–Early Historic period sites, such as Linn Lake,
attest to the long-term suitability of this area for prehistoric habitation. Based on previous
investigations within the 20-mile project region, the eastern edge of the APE (along the
Guadalupe River) has the highest potential for containing unrecorded prehistoric archaeology.
Upland sites in the 20-mile project region are rare and those that have been recorded are
associated with streams and other water features (Ricklis 2004).

The prehistoric context, in conjunction with previous geoarchaeological investigations (Peter and
Prior 2008), clearly indicated that the landscape within the 9,431-acre APE is variable, with
significant implications for the location and contextual integrity of prehistoric archaeological
sites. Although no known sites are recorded for the APE (TARL), the highest probability area for
39

prehistoric sites appears to be along the Guadalupe River margin. It must also be noted that the
early historic settlement of the region also focused on the Guadalupe River valley margin rather
than the dry uplands coastal plain. An archaeological survey methodology was developed based
on the diversity of the landforms present as well as known prehistoric and historic settlement
patterns of the region (Figure 8). This methodology called for the archaeological survey of 2,954
acres in both upland and river margin settings within the APE and a select few areas (Historic
Farmstead Areas, Heavy Haul Road, Southern Pipeline and Overflow Channel) that are either
linear corridors outside of the larger APE or are areas potentially located in or crossed by the
APE.

Uplands
The antiquity and relative geologic stability of the uplands landscape tend to preclude any real
potential for buried archaeological contexts. It is clear that the flat to very gently sloping portions
of the clayey landscapes, specifically those mapped as the Lake Charles soils, have been
relatively stable for a very long period of time, and archaeological sites in these contexts, if
present, likely have poor integrity, primarily due to argilliturbation. Therefore, given the
dynamic nature of the clay soils in the APE, further survey of areas containing Lake Charles soils
was not undertaken.
The majority of the uplands, however, are underlain by soils with sandy epipedons with low
archaeological potential. Although the sandy portions of the uplands landscape may have
experienced some eolian reworking, no evidence of substantial eolian accumulation or,
conversely, clear deflation was observed. The sandy epipedons of these soils are generally less
than 1 m thick and easily penetrated by shovel testing. In order to successfully survey these low
probability uplands areas, a block survey methodology was recommended. The uplands portion
of the APE encompasses 143 quadrats, each measuring 500-x-500-m. Thirteen of these are
composed of Lake Charles clayey soils and did not warrant survey. The remaining 130 quadrats
(91 percent) are occupied predominantly by sandy soils (see Figure 8). Shovel testing was
recommended for a 10 percent (n=13) random sample of these low probability 500-x-500-m
quadrats containing sandy uplands soils. Each quadrat is approximately 62 acres, and shovel test
density within each of the 13 quadrats was one shovel test per every two acres.
Some areas in and around the upland wetlands were expected to have a higher probability for
prehistoric occupation. It was believed that the wetland areas may have served as a major
attraction for migratory fowl and were thus targeted for shovel testing at 30-m intervals (see
Figure 8).
The only portions of the uplands landscape that have a significant potential for site burial by
Holocene sedimentation appear to be the small streams that drain the uplands. Previous trenching
(Peter and Prior 2008) in the upper reaches of these streams suggests that, although there has been
some sedimentation, these deposits are probably not more than a meter thick. In the lower,
incised reaches, however, the streams exhibit inset alluvial fills between 1 m and 2 m thick, and at
least two depositional phases are recognized. These small floodplains, above the Kinder Morgan
High Pressure Gas line, are probably too narrow to have attracted or supported prehistoric
settlement, but it is possible that downstream of the pipeline these surfaces may have been large
enough to have supported prehistoric habitation. Shovel testing at 30-m intervals was
recommended for these lower incised stream valleys both immediately above and below the
40

Kinder Morgan pipeline right-of-way (see Figure 8). Deep testing via mechanical means in these
areas was not recommended, given the number of buried utilities and limited proposed impacts
from future construction.

Guadalupe River Valley Margin
The portions of this landscape that have significant potential for buried cultural material are
floodplains of low-order tributaries, alluvial fans, colluvial toeslopes, knolls on sandy valley
margins, and mounds in the lake margin environment. Some of these settings have demonstrable
Holocene sediments and obvious formation processes whereas others appear to have Holoceneage sediments (e.g., sandy valley margin knolls and lake margin mounds), but the formation
processes associated with these landforms are not clear at this time. Given that one of the very
few places where prehistoric cultural material was observed on the ground surface was on the
clearly erosive foreshore of Linn Lake, shovel testing was the most appropriate method for
surveying the Guadalupe River valley margin.
Shovel testing at 30-m intervals was recommended for surveying the easternmost kilometer (east
to west axis) of the APE along the Guadalupe River valley margin. As with the uplands, the most
efficient means of targeting areas of significant sedimentation was to first perform a pedestrian
survey with shovel testing, keeping track of the precise locations where shovel tests were unable
to reach the Bt horizon. Upon completion of the shovel testing, a phase of deep testing
employing backhoe trenching examined those locations where shovel testing identified deep
deposits subject to impacts: near the spillway into Linn Lake, along the heavy haul road, and
adjacent to site 41VT146.
The potential for four map-documented historic homestead sites dating to the mid-nineteenth
century within this same area required a more focused strategy. Four historic farmstead areas
located along the old Kemper City Road that ran roughly north–south from Victoria to the
historic location of Kemper City are within or adjacent to the Guadalupe River valley margin of
the APE (see Figure 8). Using GIS, an area approximately 500-x-500 m was centered over each
map-documented farmstead and operated as its survey area. In addition to the 30-m-interval
valley margin shovel testing, it was recommended that each map-documented historic farmstead
area (500-x-500-m) undergo a metal detector survey. If the metal detector survey identified
historic artifacts in a given area, shovel testing was further refined to a 7.5-m interval in order to
define site limits.
Two linear rights-of-way within the project site were also surveyed along the river valley margin:
the Heavy Haul Road and the Southern Pipeline. The Heavy Haul Road right-of way, located
adjacent to Historic Farmstead Area 4 (see Figure 8), is approximately 352 m in length, with a
right-of-way of 400 ft. Six transects were placed along the length of the linear right-of-way, 20 m
apart. Shovel testing along these transects was carried out at 30-m intervals. The Southern
Pipeline right-of-way, along the southern edge of the project site (see Figure 8), is approximately
2,245 m in length with a 100-ft right-of-way. Two transects were placed along the length of the
pipeline, 20 m apart. Shovel testing along these transects was carried out at 30-m intervals.

43

Survey Field Methods
From May 9 to June 16, 2008, six five-person crews performed archaeological survey work of the
survey area using the above selection criteria based on geomorphology and the probability for
finding cultural material. Each five-person crew was equipped with either a Trimble® Pro XRS
or XT GPS unit for recording the position of shovel tests and transects, as well as surface cultural
material. All GPS data were downloaded each evening into ArcMap 9.2 software for the
generation of current project and site maps. All shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in
diameter and were excavated either to the top of the B-horizon or a depth of 80 cm, whichever
came first. The soil from each shovel test was screened through 0.25–inch hardware cloth. All
artifactual material, whether encountered on the surface or in shovel tests, was collected and
analyzed.
When positive shovel tests were encountered, radial shovel tests in each of the cardinal directions
were excavated at 10-m intervals until two negative tests were achieved. A scaled tape-andcompass map was created for each locality and site recorded. For each site, sufficient
information was recorded to permit the completion of site forms approved by the Texas Historical
Commission. Each site location was identified with a datum marker (rebar and aluminum cap)
and a temporary number in the form of “VCS-XXX.”
For areas containing historic artifact concentrations, pedestrian surveys were performed in 3-m
transects until no further surface artifacts were encountered for a distance of 50 m. All historic
surface artifacts were flagged and their positions recorded on a site map before being collected.
Historic sites were covered with a 7.5-m shovel test grid that continued in all four cardinal
directions, and shovel tests were excavated until two negative shovel tests were encountered.

GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY
Geophysical surveys were performed within the four 25-ha (62-acre) tracts previously identified
as containing historic farmsteads. The high probability of encountering relict ferrous metal oil
industry pipelines within the four areas called for a multi-instrument approach using both a Time
Domain Electromagnetic Induction Meter and a Fluxgate Gradiometer. Due to the large survey
area, instrumentation was pulled behind a four-wheel, all-terrain vehicle. One could have used a
metal detector; however, the use of the electromagnetic induction meter provides 16 readings per
second over a one meter-wide swath. That type of coverage is impossible with a standard metal
detector. The result is far greater precision of measurement than that achieved through the use of
a metal detector. In essence, one is using a high-grade metal detector (the same instrument is
used for finding unexploded ordnance).
Archaeogeophysics employs a range of techniques originally developed in the geological sciences
for the nondestructive prospection of archaeological deposits (Gaffney and Gater 2003). In
general, all geophysical techniques map, record, or sense different variables or properties of the
soil and the objects contained within the soil. The geophysical instruments are differentially
affected by variables such as soil type, moisture, metal trash or debris, and transmission of signals
such as cell phones and transmission lines. Data collection is also impacted differently for each
of the geophysical instruments by physical impediments such as trees, pavement, fences, and
vegetation.

44

Archaeologists have found that the first line of defense against this complex matrix of variables is
to come to the field prepared to collect data with several different instruments. The “multipletechnique” approach not only increases the likelihood of success in the ability to detect
archaeological features of interest, but can often enhance the visibility of the archaeological
targets that may be present at archaeological sites (Kvamme 2006a:57–58; Kvamme et al.
2006:251). Archaeogeophysical data have a long history of success in helping to focus
archaeological excavations to specific locations within sites, and under the right conditions, the
archaeogeophysical data can be used by itself as a primary source of archaeological information
(Kvamme 2003a).
The specific settings of the geophysical instruments used in this study differ greatly; however,
there are a few general concepts of data collection that apply to all geophysical technologies. The
density of the dataset is controlled by two factors: (1) traverse interval—the distance between the
passes the instrument makes as it is moved back and forth across the collection area; and (2)
sample interval—the distance between readings the instrument records as it passes along each
traverse. There are standards for these settings, but ultimately they depend on many factors,
including the size and depth of the targets of interest (i.e., archaeological features), the nature of
the sediment matrix, land use of the survey area, and duration of the survey, as well as the
investigative scope of the overall project research design.
There are different ways to record the locations of the individual geophysical readings.
Collecting gridded data requires surveyors to lay out grids on the ground that are then used to
guide the surveyor over the collection area. Some techniques allow for integration with GPS so
each data point is stored with UTM coordinates. This makes it possible to collect with little to no
site preparation. Data points are then gridded during post-fieldwork data processing.

Time Domain Electromagnetic Induction
Electromagnetic induction is a general process in which a weak electromagnetic eddy current is
transmitted through the ground and then recorded. The data can be used to determine the
apparent conductivity as well as the magnetic susceptibility of the ground through which the
current was passed. There are a range of electromagnetic induction meters (EM) used in
geophysics with different sizes and spacing of the transmission and receiving coils as well as
different methods of electromagnetic induction. The separation of the transmitting and receiving
coils has implications concerning the depth at which the eddy currents can be transmitted. If the
frequency of the EM signal is kept constant, increasing the distance between the coils allows for
deeper target resolution. There are two basic transmission methods: (1) continuous wave (CW),
where the coils are charged with a sinusoidal alternating current by the change in the inducing
primary magnetic field; and (2) transient electromagnetic methods (TEM), where the coils
produce small dipole magnetic fields that vary in amplitude and duration (Milsom 2005:129).
Time Domain Electromagnetic Induction Meters such as the Geonics EM61 employed in the
current survey use TEM principles and are designed specifically for locating unexploded
ordnance (UXO). These “super metal detectors” can also be used for precisely locating small
metal objects (Milsom 2005:147).
The EM survey was guided using a real time kinematic (RTK) GPS with ± 1-cm horizontal
accuracy. An ATV was used to pull the instrument across the collection area. The data logging
application, Trackmaker 61, has a “heads up” display on the Allegro CX data recorder providing
45

the surveyor with heading information, speed, and a visual display of the area covered. An
additional GPS unit, Tee Jet Centerline 220, designed to guide agricultural equipment in parallel
passes across a field, was used to help guide the collection. This ensured both equal and
systematic coverage. EM data were collected at 18 readings/second along traverses ranging from
10 m to 15 m apart depending on terrain and surface vegetation.

Magnetometry
Magnetometers and gradiometers are passive instruments that measure slight variations in the
magnetic properties of soil.
Magnetometers have become the primary tool for
archaeogeophysicists working on prehistoric archaeological sites due in part because geophysical
data can be collected and processed rapidly and efficiently. When conditions are right, due to the
properties of specific soils, magnetometers have proven useful in locating negative relief features
such as pits and postholes as well as thermally altered features such as fire hearths and burned
structures (Gaffney et al. 2000; Kvamme 2003b; Walker and Perttula 2007, 2008; Walker and
Schultz 2008).
Magnetometers record the minute fluctuations that sediments and objects have on the earth’s
magnetic field. This is known as induced magnetism because the object does not maintain its
own magnetic field. If the effects of this induced magnetism are strong enough compared to the
surrounding soil matrix, pit features or postholes can be identified or resolved in the geophysical
data. A second type of magnetism called remanent magnetism is created when an object
maintains its own magnetic field. In prehistoric archaeological examples, this occurs when
objects are thermally altered, thus creating a magnetic state called thermoremanent magnetism
(Kvamme 2006b:207). The specific magnetometer used in the current study is discussed in detail
by Bartington and Chapman (2004). Magnetometers can also be used to locate ferrous objects
such as historic metal artifacts—the objective of the current archaeogeophysical project.
Although the EM was used to efficiently locate the metal objects across the landscape, a more
refined high-resolution technique using a Bartington fluxgate Gradiometer (magnetometer) was
used to locate the individual pieces of metal for ground-truthing.
After the EM data were collected and processed (see below for details on data processing),
geographic locations for anomalies or “hits” were calculated and entered into the RTK GPS.
These points were then marked on the ground using non-magnetic pin flags for inspection with
the magnetometer. The magnetometer was used in “Scan” mode with a audible response set to
±5 nano-tesla (nt), so that each 5 nt increase or decrease increased the audible signal. The
magnetometer was passed back and forth across the area in the vicinity of where EM anomalies
were recorded. All readings of ±20 nt were marked with nonmagnetic pin flags and groundtruthed by researchers from GMI.

Geophysical Data Processing and Interpretation
Data were processed and filtered to remove extraneous false readings (spikes and drop-outs).
Datasets were processed to enhance the visibility of any target features through statistical
manipulation of the recorded data as well as through image processing of the image file output.
The general goal of data processing is to lessen the effects of background “noise” and to enhance
46

the quality of the “signal” or “target” in the geophysical data. In field geophysics in general, and
archaeogeophysics in particular, the term “noise” is used to discuss any return that is not a direct
result of the object under investigation, this being referred to as the “target” or “signal.” Hence,
in some cases what is discussed as noise can in another case become the signal or target (Milsom
2005:13–14). Accuracy of the geophysical readings are not as important for resolving targets in
the geophysical data as is the contrast between the target and its surrounding matrix.
The general approach to data processing follows Kvamme (2006c:236), in that computer
processing of the geophysical data is used to identify regular and culturally interpretable patterns
using pattern recognition principles: “In general, anomalies exhibiting regular geometric shapes
(lines, circles, squares, rectangles) tend to be of human origin” (Kvamme 2006c:236). After each
processing step, the results are closely compared to their previous processed state to ensure that
data manipulation is not in fact decreasing the clarity and quality of the data, thereby avoiding the
creation of processed images that are primarily products of the data processing itself.
EM data were processed using TrackMaker 61 by Geomar Software, as well as ArcGIS 9.2 ESRI.
TrackMaker was used to convert the files to an XYZ format positioned with GPS coordinates.
TrackMaker interpolates the locations of the points in-between GPS readings. A GPS reading
was logged every second, and 18 EM readings were logged every second. Thus, the positions of
17 of the 18 EM readings logged every second were interpolated by the TrackMaker program.
This interpolation process is conducted after the data are logged, and therefore it utilizes GPS
readings on both sides of the EM readings. After the data were converted into XYZ files, they
were imported into ArcGIS 9.2. The data were gridded using an inverse distance weighted
(IDW) gridding algorithm with a fixed 3-m search radius.
Gridded data files were projected as stretched images and overlaid onto both aerial photographs
and topographic maps. Areas with peaks in the amplitude of the EM response were marked with
a point on a shape file. When appropriate, the EM data image files were regained to redistribute
the images in gray scale. Attention was also placed on the locations of the amplitude peaks, and
areas on the crests of landforms were given close attention. In areas of rough terrain, the creation
of false positives was inevitable. Dragging the EM search loops over brush and extremely rough
terrain causes the instrument to shake or bounce and can create as much as a 2 to 3 milivolt (mv)
spike, well within the expected range of response for a deeply buried small metal object. Small
metal objects on the surface or in shallowly buried contexts typically produce a much stronger
20+ mv spike.

GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Deposits were examined in the field by means of exposures excavated with a backhoe. Trench
locations were chosen in order to examine a representative suite of geomorphic settings, with a
bias in favor of those that may represent dynamic Holocene depositional environments. A
geoarchaeologist cleaned the exposure with a trowel and/or a knife and then described the profile
in general accordance with Schoeneber et al. (2002). The exception was that the fundamental
unit of field observation, a “zone,” was used to represent any physically different deposit. All
zones were subsequently assigned soil horizon designations. Trench descriptions are provided in
Appendix A. The approximate age of the deposits examined in the field was inferred based on
the degree of soil development in accordance with local soil-geomorphic studies (e.g., Aiuvalasit
2006, 2007; Frederick and Bateman 2007) and general principles outlined by Birkeland (1999).

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS METHODS
All cultural materials collected during the survey and site recording were returned to the GMI
laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, where all artifacts were washed, catalogued, and labeled in
compliance with TARL standards. Following this, GMI personnel conducted the various types of
artifact analyses.
The artifact collection recovered from the archeological sites and nonsite localities investigated
during the present survey consists of 14 prehistoric lithic artifacts/debris and 986 historic
artifacts. Details of the observations collected on each class are summarized below and discussed
more fully in Appendix B.

Lithic Analysis
The major prehistoric artifact class used in the lithic analysis is lithic debitage. Variables
recorded for the lithic debitage included technological type of debitage, amount of dorsal cortex
(if present), heat-treatment or burning, material type, size range, and weight.
Of the 14 lithic artifacts collected, all are various pieces of flaking debris. No ground, pecked, or
battered stone tools were found. There were no bifacial fragments or projectile points recovered
during the survey. The lithic debitage was classified by technological reduction source (i.e., core
flakes, biface flakes, flake fragments, and shatter; see Appendix B).

Historic Artifact Analysis
Nine hundred and eighty-six historic artifacts were collected during the course of the current
project. These artifacts were examined by laboratory staff for particular attributes and diagnostic
traits, using morphological and/or functional classification systems developed by South (1977).
Four primary categories were used for the assignment of recovered artifacts—Activities,
Architectural, Domestic, and Personal (see Appendix B). The Activities category includes any
nonhousehold items, transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The
Architectural category includes all items related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails,
window glass, and electrical items. The Domestic category designation was used for items
related to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food preparation and tin cans);
Furnishings, a subcategory of Domestics, encompass household items such as furniture, stove
parts, and lamp glass. The Personal category contains generally contains items of individual use
such as clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS DATABASE
Various observations for each artifact classification mentioned above were recorded and entered
into an ACCESS database format on an IBM network system. In addition, computer printouts of
all data were compiled and archived with the permanent project files (see Appendix B). The
results of the analyses of this collection are presented along with the descriptions for each site in
the following chapters, and the raw data are presented in Appendix B at the end of the report.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

Phase Ib work included archaeological survey as well as geoarchaeological and geophysical
investigations. The results of each of the methodologies are presented below.

GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Personnel from Archaeo-Geophysical Associates, LLC (AGA), performed a geophysical survey
in order to identify metallic historic artifacts. The survey was conducted at four 25-ha (62-acre)
tracts identified archivally as historic farmstead areas potentially containing historic
archaeological deposits (Figure 9). Data were collected with a Time Domain Electromagnetic
Induction Meter as well as a Fluxgate Gradiometer. Numerous anomalies and obstructions were
encountered in Historic Farmstead Area 1; all related to modern oil industry activities. Several
additional anomalies were ground-truthed via shovel testing at the remaining three historic areas
(Historic Farmstead Areas 2–4); however, only the anomalies encountered in Historic Farmstead
Area 4 were of archaeological significance. Geophysical investigations at several of the historic
areas revealed extensive modern oil industry disturbance.

Historic Farmstead Area 1
Historic Farmstead Area 1, located in the southeast corner of the project site (see Figure 9),
revealed the most extensive modern oil industry disturbance, as 13 buried oil pipelines were
delineated (Figure 10). Additional disturbance in the form of surface wells, outbuildings, and
roads were encountered throughout Historic Farmstead Area 1. Because of the amount of
background noise, the geophysical work in Historic Farmstead Area 1 was not able to reliably
record isolated anomalies. Additionally, pedestrian survey of this area also failed to record any
historic-age artifacts predating the oil industry in South Texas.

49

Historic Farmstead Area 2
Historic Farmstead Area 2 is located adjacent to Linn Lake (see Figure 9). This particular area
was free of oil industry disturbance, and geophysical work here only recorded 12 isolated
anomalies (Figure 11). Each of these anomalies was ground-truthed by an archaeologist, and in
each case, modern ferrous metal debris was detected. Additional archaeological survey in
Historic Farmstead Area 2 also failed to detect any cultural material.

Historic Farmstead Area 3
Located along the APE boundary northwest of Historic Farmstead Area 2, Historic Farmstead
Area 3 revealed a mixture of oil industry disturbance and 27 anomalies of modern origin (Figure
12; see Figure 9). Additional archaeological survey work in Historic Farmstead Area 3, also
failed to detect any cultural material.

Historic Farmstead Area 4
Historic Farmstead Area 4 is located in the northeast corner of the project site (see Figure 9).
Geophysical prospection in this area detected six buried oil pipelines and numerous features
related to the modern oil industry. Twenty anomalies were detected in total for Historic
Farmstead Area 4, with 13 detected between two of the buried pipelines in the western half of the
area (Figure 13). Upon further inspection by archaeologists, these anomalies were historic-age
artifacts on the ground surface. After further pedestrian survey and shovel testing, this scatter of
historic artifacts was given the temporary site designation of 41VT145.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
As proposed by Peter and Prior (2008), the 11,500-acre project site was separated into survey
areas based on geomorphology and the potential for historic sites (Figure 14).
Geomorphologically, the APE was broadly dived into an Uplands region and the Guadalupe
River Margin, each with survey strategies reflecting the probability of cultural material. Areas of
high probability for historic sites outside of the APE were delineated based on the location of
structures found on historic maps of the project area. Additionally, two linear right-of-ways
(Heavy Haul Road and Southern Pipeline) were surveyed outside of the APE. Upon completion
of the archaeological survey, five sites and three localities had been recorded (Table 5). Two of
these sites were associated with historic period artifacts, and the remaining three sites and three
localities were associated with prehistoric cultural remains, all documented in the Guadalupe
River Margin survey area.

Uplands
Shovel testing performed in the uplands areas (sandy soils, wetlands, and creeks) did not reveal
buried prehistoric or historic cultural material. All excavated shovel tests were able to reach
subsoil, and deep excavation via backhoe was not necessary in any of the uplands areas. Due to
the lack of any cultural material being detected in any of these areas, no further work is
recommended at this time in any of the uplands areas (sandy soils, wetlands, and creeks).
Guadalupe River Valley Margin
Archaeological survey within the northern and southern reaches of the Guadalupe River Margin
areas (Figures 15 and 16) resulted in the discovery of three prehistoric localities, three prehistoric
sites, and two historic sites. A site was defined when materials were recovered from two or more
shovel tests or, for surface material, when five or more artifacts were found within a 20-m square
area. Artifact clusters not meeting the criteria for a site were given the designation of “locality.”
One of the two historic sites detected along the Guadalupe River valley margin was located
within Historic Farmstead Area 4. Each locality and site were delineated with a minimum of two
negative shovel tests (at 10-m intervals) in each of the cardinal directions from the original
positive shovel test. A temporary datum was placed within each site and its location recorded via
differential GPS. Sites were given identifying numbers: 41VT145, 41VT146, 41VT147,
41VT148, and 41VT149, and localities were numbered sequentially.
Historic Sites
Site 41VT145
Introduction
Located within Historic Farmstead Area 4, site 41VT145 is approximately 85-x-85 m, atop a
knoll covered in scrub and native prairie grasses, with views of the Guadalupe River valley to the
northeast (see Figure 9). 41VT145 was located during the survey of Historic Farmstead Area 4
57

after geophysical anomalies were detected. After the initial positive shovel tests investigating
ferrous metal anomalies were excavated, a pedestrian surface survey was performed of the
surrounding area. Once the historic surface scatter was delineated, a 7.5-m shovel test grid was
excavated over the area in order to determine the vertical and horizontal limits of the site (Figure
17). Historic artifacts from 41VT145 were found from the surface to depths of 20–30 cm and
were characterized as late nineteenth-century to early twentieth-century material (Table 6). No
features were located during the survey of 41VT145.
Archival Data
According to an 1864 map of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, the farmstead located in
Historic Area 4 is identified as belonging to “Bockmier,” but this label is erroneous (Peter and
Prior 2008). There is no listing of anyone by that name living in the project area in the Victoria
County Index to Deeds, 1838 – 1888, but there is a Thomas W. Babcock. While the historic map
was drawn in 1864, some eight years before Babcock bought his tract of land, it is possible that
he rented the property or worked as a tenant farmer on the property as these agreements do not
appear in the county records.
Babcock was listed as paying his taxes in December of 1868, but there is no listing of him
owning any real property until 1872 (Victoria County 1868, Victoria County 1872). In the fall of
1870, Babcock purchased some cattle from D. J. Ford, but the number of head is not listed in the
transaction (Victoria County 1870).
Thomas W. Babcock was listed in the 1870 Census as being a native of Missouri and a farmer by
occupation. He was 27 years old, and was living with his wife, Margaret W. Babcock, who was
25 and a native of Louisiana. The census listed her occupation as a house keeper. The Babcocks
had four children: Martha N. (8), Mary A. (6), Harvey N. (2), and Ida Lee Babcock (9 ½ months).
Martha Crier, a 55 year-old native of Louisiana, is also listed as living with the Babcock’s, and is
presumably Thomas’ mother-in-law (Census Bureau 1870).
In January of 1872, Thomas W. Babcock purchased 100 acres from John Hunt for $200.00 in
cash. The property was situated on the Desiderio Nira survey. He and his family did not settle
there long, as Babcock sold the same parcel of land for the same price to Elisha Thomas in
August of 1876. There is no further mention of Thomas W. Babcock in the public records in
Victoria County, except for when his parcel of land is sold after he vacated it. It is referred to as
“the Babcock Place” in these transactions (Victoria County 1876, Victoria County 1882). At this
time, the association between the 1864 map with the farmstead named “Bockmier” and Thomas
W. Babcock are uncertain.

Artifact Assemblage
A total of 724 artifacts was collected from site 41VT145, consisting of 48 ecofacts (15 pieces of
animal bone, 1 piece of mussel shell, and 32 pieces of baked clay), and 676 historic artifacts. The
historic artifacts are subdivided into functional classes, with 250 being considered architectural,
233 domestic, 5 furnishing, 9 personal, 27 activities, and 152 indeterminate. The indeterminate
artifacts are generally small fragments of glass or metal that cannot be placed in one of the other
categories.

The Architectural category consists of: handmade brick (n=74; pre-1903); mortar (n=29);
concrete (n=1); cement (n=1); cut stone (n=5); a large sandstone fragment (n=1); cut nails (n=21;
1840-1880); wire nails (n=4; post-1890); window glass (including aqua [n=36], clear [n=48; post1880], and light green [n=29]); and a screw head. The large numbers of handmade brick and cut
nails in the assemblage indicate that the site was first occupied in the mid- to late nineteenth
century, while the small numbers of wire nails may be related to later repairs. The clear window
glass also suggests a somewhat later occupation than indicated by the cut nails; once again, this
may be the result of replacing broken windows or the later addition of glass window panes to a
structure built without them.
The Domestic artifacts are composed of ceramics (n=77) and glass (n=156). Historic ceramics
include: blue tinted, high fired ironstone (n=8; 1850-1910); blue tinted, high fired ironstone with
an Alfred Meakin maker’s mark (n=1; 1870-1900); blue tinted, non vitrified ironstone (n=5;
1850-1910); burned/discolored ironstone (n=1); porcelain (n=23); Bristol and natural clay slipped
exterior/natural clay slipped interior stoneware (n=3; 1890-1915); Bristol exterior/natural clay
slipped interior stoneware (n=6; 1890-1915); and Bristol interior/exterior stoneware (n=3; post1900); light blue tinted whiteware (n=18; 1880-1930); pure white whiteware (n=5; post-1890);
burned/discolored whiteware (n=1); and yellowware (n=3). The glass includes: aqua (n=23);
clear with ash tint (n=12; post-1915); clear (n=47); clear basal sherd from a cup mold (n=1; 18801900); light green (n=16); manganese/solarized bottle glass (n=17; 1880-1920);
manganese/solarized bottle base with Owen’s ring (n=1; 1910-1920); manganese solarized table
glass (n=3; 1880-1920); milk glass (n=1); olive bottle glass (n=1); and purple table glass (n=8).
The diagnostic artifacts are generally consistent with a late nineteenth and early twentieth century
occupation.
The Furnishings category consists of clear lamp glass (n=4; post-1880) and a complete furniture
castor. Personal items include: a porcelain 4-hole button (n=1); a porcelain doll part (n=1); snuff
bottle fragments (n=2; post-1920); a milk glass 4-hole button (n=1); a shoe eyelet (n=1); a 1901
Indianhead penny (n=1); and shell buttons (n=2). Indeterminate artifacts include angular (n=7)
and burned/melted (n=1) glass fragments, unidentifiable metal fragments (n=133), and an
unidentified artifact consisting of a sheet of black rubber covering an unidentified yellow
material.
63

The Activities category includes: unidentified barbed wire (n=3); Glidden's Barb, Common
Variation barbed wire (n=1; post-1874); fence staples (n=7); a harness buckle (n=1); a
mattock/grub hoe head (n=1); a foot pedal, possibly from a tractor (n=1); a threaded rod with
square nut (n=1); an iron bar (n=1); a possible hand wrought hook and eye (n=2); a grommet
(n=1); cartridge cases (n=4); and shotgun shell bases (n=4). The cartridge cases consist of: a .22
caliber long or long rifle with no headstamp (post-1871); a .22 caliber short with no head stamp
(post-1857); a .38 caliber centerfire with “.38 W.C.F. WRA CO” headstamp (1875-1940); and a
.44 caliber centerfire with “W.R.A. CO./.44 W.C.F.” headstamp (1875-1940). The shotgun shell
bases headstamps include: “UMC CO./No. 10/NEW CLUB” (n=2; 1867-1911); “UMC CO./No.
12/NEW CLUB” (n=1; 1867-1911); and “WESTERN/No. 12/NEW CHIEF” (n=1; 1898-1940).

Summary
Site 41VT145 is located on a Lake Charles clay landform and as a result has suffered the effects
of repeated shrink-swell cycles typical of vertisols. At the time of survey, 2-inch wide cracks
were visible along the surface, across the site (Figures 18 and 19). Geophysical results also
located two buried pipelines running through the eastern and western edges of the site.
Additionally, a high percentage of recovered artifacts from 41VT145 revealed evidence of
burning.
Current pasture management includes controlled burning every 3–5 years.
Unfortunately, the limited assemblage together with the lack of any recognizable features,
severely limits the research potential of this site. At the present time, one cannot relate a
particular artifact assemblage to specific features or activities. In fact, the lack of wells and other
features typical of late nineteenth/early twentieth century sites, indicates this site may have served
as temporary or intermittent locations for early ranch-related activities and not as a homestead.
Due to its inability to yield significant historical information, (in addition to the ongoing process
of argilliturbation, the disturbance caused from burial of pipelines, and the repeated burnings of
the pasture containing site 41VT145), no further work is recommended.

Site 41VT146
Site 41VT146 is located along the southeastern edge of the Guadalupe River valley margin (see
Figure 16). The site is approximately 60-x-45-m and sits atop a small knoll covered in mature
live oaks. Documentary research was unable to associate 41VT146 with any known historical
farmstead within the survey area. Site 41VT146 was located during the survey of the Guadalupe
River Valley margin area. After the initial positive shovel test, a pedestrian surface survey was
performed in the surrounding area. Once the historic surface scatter was delineated, a 7.5-m
shovel test grid was excavated over the area in order to determine the vertical and horizontal
limits of the site (Figure 20). Historic artifacts from 41VT146 found from the surface to depths
of 50 cm are characteristic of late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century material (Table 7). No
features were located during the survey of 41VT146.

A total of 262 artifacts was collected from site 41VT146, consisting of ecofacts (animal bone
fragments {n=102}, shell fragments {n=5}, charcoal {n=3}, baked clay {n=6}), and historic
artifacts (n=152). The historic artifacts are subdivided into Architectural (n=76), Domestic
(n=50), Indeterminate (n=21), Furnishing (n=2), Activities (n=1), and Personal (n=2) categories.
The Architectural artifacts consist of: handmade brick (n=20; pre-1903), concrete (n=1), mortar
(n=10), cut nails (n=26; 1840-1880); wire nails (n=2; post-1890); window glass (aqua [n=4];
clear [n=7; post-1880], and light green [n=5]); and an escutcheon plate, probably from a door
lock. Once again, the architectural artifacts indicate that the site was built in the late nineteenth
century, while the wire nails and clear window glass probably indicate later repairs.
The Domestic category is composed of glass (n=28) and ceramic (n=22). The domestic glass
includes: amber/brown bottle glass (n=3), aqua bottle glass (n=5), clear with ash tint bottle glass
(n=1; post-1915); clear bottle glass (n=9; post-1880); clear table glass (n=1; post-1880); light
green bottle glass (n=3); manganese/solarized bottle glass (n=1; 1880-1920); and olive bottle
glass (n=5). The historic ceramics include: blue tinted, high fired ironstone (n=5; 1850-1910);
blue tinted, non-vitrified (n=7; 1850-1910); burned/discolored ironstone (n=1); porcelain (n=2);
redware (n=1); natural clay slipped exterior/interior stoneware (n=1; 1875-1900); light blue tinted
whiteware (n=1; 1880-1930); and pure white whiteware (n=4; post-1890). As with 41VT145, the
Domestic artifacts generally support an occupation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries.
The remaining artifact categories are much more limited in scope than at 41VT145. Personal
items are limited to a ceramic marble (1880-1920) and an iron, 4-hole button. Activities-related
items consist of a .44 caliber cartridge case with a “W.R.A. CO./.44 W.C.F.” headstamp (18751940). Furnishing consists of clear lamp glass (n=2; post-1890). Finally, the Indeterminate
artifacts consist of paper (n=2), a sample from an ash deposit, and unidentifiable metal fragments
(n=19).
Site 41VT146 is located within a small group of trees that acts as a natural shaded area for cattle
(Figure 21). This shaded area has a noticeable accumulation of dung and leaf litter. This area
was deep-tested via backhoe trenching and found to have very organic sediments to a depth of

60 cm below surface that included a mixture of historic artifacts, modern refuse, and dung. The
limited assemblage together with the lack of any recognizable features, severely limits the
research potential of this site. At the present time, one cannot relate a particular artifact
assemblage to specific features or activities. The lack of wells and other features typical of late
nineteenth/early twentieth century sites, indicates this site may have served as temporary or
intermittent locations for early ranch-related activities and not as a homestead. Due to its inability
to yield significant historical information, (as well as the ongoing cattle-related bioturbation
present at 41VT146), no further work is recommended.

Prehistoric Sites and Localities

Site 41VT147
Located approximately 1 km west of Linn Lake within native short grasses (see Figure 16), site
41VT147 consists of two positive shovel tests 10 m apart. Radial shovel tests were performed in
each of the cardinal directions (10-m interval) from the original positive until two consecutive
negative shovel tests were encountered (Figure 22). From the two positive shovel tests, a total of
three primary reduction flakes was encountered. No additional artifacts or diagnostic cultural
material or features were encountered in any of the radial shovel tests. Due to the low artifact
density as well as the lack of diagnostic material and intact features at site 41VT147, no further
work is recommended.

Site 41VT148
Northwest of site 41VT147, along the APE boundary, site 41VT148 sits atop a small rise covered
in native prairie grasses (see Figure 15). Site 41VT148 consists of four adjacent positive shovel
tests (10-m interval) containing a total of four secondary reduction flakes. Radial shovel tests
were performed in each of the cardinal directions (10-m interval) from the original positive unit
until two consecutive negative shovel tests were encountered (Figure 23). No additional artifacts
or diagnostic cultural material or features were encountered in any of the radial shovel tests. Due
to the low artifact density and lack of intact features at site 41VT148, no further work is
recommended.

Site 41VT149
Approximately 400 m northwest of site 41VT148, on the slight downward slope of a draw (see
Figure 15), 41VT149 consists of four adjacent positive shovel tests (10-m interval) containing a
total of four secondary reduction flakes. Radial shovel tests were performed in each of the
cardinal directions (10-m interval) from the original positive test until two consecutive negative
shovel tests were encountered (Figure 24). No additional artifacts or diagnostic cultural material
or features were encountered in any of the radial shovel tests. Given its location on the slight
downward slope of a large draw, it appears that site 41VT149 represents the colluvial
accumulation of cultural material from upslope rather than an intact archaeological deposit.
Because of its lack of integrity, low artifact density, lack of intact features, and no diagnostic
materials, no further work is recommended.

Locality 1
Situated along the APE boundary approximately 1.5 km west of Linn Lake (see Figure 16),
Locality 1 consists of one positive shovel test containing one secondary reduction flake. Radial
shovel tests were performed in each of the cardinal directions (10-m interval) from the original
positive unit until two consecutive negative shovel tests were encountered (Figure 25). No
additional cultural material or features were encountered in any of the radial shovel tests. The
results of investigations revealed that this area fails to meet the criteria for a site, and thus no
further work is recommended for Locality 1.

Locality 2
Located approximately 85 m east of 41VT148 (see Figure 15), Locality 2 consists of one positive
shovel test containing one secondary reduction quartzite flake recovered from 0–37 cm below
surface. Radial shovel tests were performed in each of the cardinal directions (10-m interval)
from the original positive unit until two consecutive negative shovel tests were encountered
(Figure 26). No additional cultural material or features were encountered in any the radial shovel
tests. The results of investigations revealed that this area fails to meet the criteria for a site, and
thus no further work is recommended for Locality 2.

Locality 3
Located approximately 90 m north of site 41VT149 (see Figure 15), Locality 3 consists of one
positive shovel test containing one secondary reduction flake. Radial shovel tests were performed
in each of the cardinal directions (10-m interval) from the original positive unit until two
consecutive negative shovel tests were encountered (Figure 27). No additional artifacts or
diagnostic cultural material or features were encountered in any the radial shovel tests. The
results of investigations revealed that this area fails to meet the criteria for a site, and thus no
further work is recommended for Locality 3.
GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Geoarchaeological investigations focused on areas where there was potential for archaeological
contexts below shovel test depth (>80 cm). The Phase Ia investigations revealed that the
Guadalupe River valley margin was the primary location for potential buried archaeological
contexts. For this reason, two locations along the river valley margin were selected for backhoe
trenching: the proposed locations for the Heavy Haul Road and the Overflow Channel (Figure
28, Appendix A). Additionally, backhoe trenching was carried out adjacent to site 41VT146 in
an effort to better understand site formation processes and geomorphology.
Site 41VT146
Historic artifacts were recovered from shovel tests at portions of site 41VT146 at relatively deep
depths (ca. 50–60 cm), and geoarchaeological backhoe trenching was advised as a means for
better understanding the site formation processes and mechanisms for possible disturbance.
Three backhoe trenches were excavated in and adjacent to site 41VT146 (Figure 29). Trenches 1
and 3 were placed at the perimeter of the site and revealed typical Lissie/Beaumont Pleistocene
formations overlain with approximately 30–50 cm of sandy Holocene sediments. Trench 2
(Figure 30) was excavated within the site adjacent to a shovel test that had yielded historic
materials from depths of 50–60 cm. This trench revealed a very organic level complete with
manure and leaf litter to depths of approximately 60 cm, suggesting recent formation and
continual disturbance. This evidence along with other ranching-related features noted at the site
(i.e., corral post and barbed wire), suggest that 41VT146 has served as a corral and herding site in
historic times.

Heavy Haul Road
The proposed heavy haul road route is located just east of Historic Farmstead Area 4, from the
river valley margin boundary north to the property boundary (Figure 31). A series of four
backhoe trenches was excavated along the edge of the terrace formation where deeply buried
Holocene sediments were most likely to be present. Two trenches (Trenches 4 and 5) were
placed along the terrace edge and revealed approximately 50–60 cm sandy Holocene sediments
atop Lissie/Beaumont Pleistocene formations (Figure 32). Trenches 6 and 7 were place farther
downslope from the terrace, and although they revealed colluvial processes, they did not contain
Holocene sediments greater than could be penetrated with regular shovel testing (i.e., 80 cm
below surface). In each case, Pleistocene formations were evident at approximately 40–50 cm
below ground surface.

Overflow Channel
Along the river valley margin, adjacent to Historic Farmstead Area 2, is the proposed location for
the cooling basin overflow channel (Figure 33). Three backhoe trenches (trenches 8, 9, and 10)
were excavated near the proposed overflow channel with similar results. Holocene sediments in
this area of the river valley margin were thin, not well developed, and never exceeded 20 cm in
depth below ground surface. The Lissie/Beaumont Pleistocene formation was evident at depths
of approximately 15–20 cm in each trench (Figure 34). Soils in this area were primarily of
aeolian derivation, which possibly explains the shallow nature of the A-horizon soils in this
particular section of the river valley margin. Due to the shallow nature of Holocene sediments in
this area, the potential for deeply buried cultural material is very low.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SUMMARY
Archaeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted archaeological survey of approximately 2,954
acres within the 9,431-acre APE in advance of the proposed Victoria County Station, Units 1 and
2, construction in Victoria County, Texas. The Phase Ib archaeological project area is located 13
miles south-southwest of Victoria, Texas. Five archaeological sites and three localities were
located during the archaeological survey. Two of the sites were recorded as having exclusively
historic components and three were identified as exclusively prehistoric. Additionally, the three
localities were exclusively prehistoric in nature.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY

Criteria for Evaluation of Eligibility
As part of the Section 106 review process, cultural resources investigations are undertaken with
the purpose of identifying resources that are listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. The assessment of significance of cultural resources is based on
federal guidelines and regulations. Any cultural resource that is listed on or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register is known as a “historic property,” and the term “eligible for inclusion in
the National Register” includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of
the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria (36 CFR [Code of
Federal Regulations] §800.2). The criteria for evaluating properties for inclusion in the National
Register (36 CFR §60.4 [a–d]) are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Subsequent to the identification of relevant
historical themes and related research questions, these four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and

85

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Note
that the application of Criterion D presupposes that the information imparted by the site is
significant in history or prehistory [36 CFR §60.4, emphasis added].

The physical characteristics and historic significance of the overall property are examined when
conducting NRHP evaluations. Although a property in its entirety may be considered eligible
based on Criteria A, B, C, and/or D, specific data are also required for individual components
therein based on date, function, history, physical characteristics, and other information.
Resources that do not relate in a significant way to the overall property may contribute if they
independently meet the National Register criteria.
The scientific value of archaeological sites is assessed under Criterion D. With regard
specifically to this criterion, the goal of prehistoric archaeological research and management is to
fill gaps in our knowledge about specific research domains. Scientific importance is partially
driven by the research paradigms of the time and in part by the amount of information available
about a particular research topic in a specific geographic area. The most robust forms of
scientific importance should honor diverse and occasionally competing schools of research
interests and their attendant approaches. In order to fulfill Criterion D, a site must possess certain
attributes, such as intact buried cultural strata with functionally and temporally diagnostic
materials, datable cultural features, and so on, such that further intensive research at the site could
be expected to add additional information to relevant research questions.
The research domains are addressed through testing and excavation programs; over time, data
required for addressing specific questions are collected, analyzed, and compiled. Eventually, the
potential importance, or significance, of sites that contain only the types of data already collected
may diminish. This suggests that the identification criteria of important historic properties are
tied to both a specific geographic area reflecting a cultural adaptation or cultural region and a
state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain topic. The criteria and priorities of
important sites are apt to shift as accepted research paradigms change or as data accumulations
approach redundancy. Archaeological sites that retain contextual integrity and contain artifacts
and features capable of contributing information toward addressing relevant research issues are
significant and should therefore be considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY SUMMARY
Archaeological properties considered in the present report were judged to be either eligible, not
eligible, or of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D. Eligibility
determinations for the five archaeological sites within the project area focused on two elements:
(1) the degree of contextual integrity exhibited by each site (i.e., are individual components
isolable within the sediment matrix?) and (2) the potential for data recovery that will contribute to
86

our understanding of regional research questions. A recommendation of “not eligible” was
applied to those sites that did not exhibit contextual integrity (e.g., argilliturbation) or failed to
exhibit an artifact assemblage or feature complex that would allow addressing meaningful
research questions related to technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extraregional
interaction. Using the above criteria, all sites encountered within the project area are
recommended as not eligible under Criterion D (Table 8). Additionally, due to the inconclusive
documentary research for 41VT145 and 41VT146, these two sites are also recommended as not
eligible under Criteria A and B. The remaining prehistoric sites (41VT147, 41VT148, and
41VT149) all lacked artifact assemblages or feature complexes that would retain sufficient data to
address questions of technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extraregional interaction.
