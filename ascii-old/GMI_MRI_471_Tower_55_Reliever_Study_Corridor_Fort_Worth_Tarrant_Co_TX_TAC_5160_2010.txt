EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Jacobs Engineering, Inc., the prime contractor for the North Central Texas Council of
Governments (NCTCOG), subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine), to conduct the
cultural resources survey of the Tower 55 Reliever study corridor (CSJ 0902-48-693), which is
designed to improve the movement of all trains within and around current rail infrastructure that
converges on Tower 55 in Fort Worth. Geo-Marine was responsible for investigating the project
area for compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915], requiring cultural
resources surveys. In addition, the ultimate client, NCTCOG, is a political subdivision of the
state of Texas and thus must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the
Natural Resources Code of Texas]. Geo-Marine conducted this project under Texas Antiquities
Code permit #5160 in February and early March 2009.
Tower 55 is located in the southwest quadrant of the Interstate Highway (IH) 30/IH 35W
interchange. This interchange includes the rail corridors of the Union Pacific Railroad, the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company, the Fort Worth & Western Railroad, and public
rail. This report presents the findings of the cultural resources background research and intensive
survey conducted along the Tower 55 study corridor between Page Avenue in the south, to the
intersection of the joint use line at Old Denton Road in the north. Additionally, the central
portion of the APE includes an area to the east toward Meacham Boulevard where new rail siding
tracks will be placed between IH 35W and Meacham Boulevard. The Tower 55 Reliever corridor
is approximately 11.37 miles long and the right-of-way is generally about 100–150 feet wide.
With the exception of the rail trench, which will have drill shafts to 100 feet and a maximum
depth of 30 feet, all of the work will be at grade; in other words, maximum depth of the
remainder of the project is 3 to 6 feet. The archaeological survey was confined to the existing
right-of-way.
The ultimate goal of this project was to identify and inventory cultural resources properties
contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. The
entire right-of-way exhibited severe disturbance from the original construction of the rail lines in
the late nineteenth century and subsequent reworking through the years. No archaeological
resources were found. No further archaeological investigations are recommended within the
iii

current investigated rail right-of-way. However, should future project plans call for modification
to be made to the landscape outside the current right-of-way, intensive archaeological survey
would be necessary.
All materials generated from this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine), was subcontracted by Jacobs Engineering, Inc., the prime
contractor for the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) to conduct the
cultural resources surveys (Geo-Marine Project #30389.01.01) along the Tower 55 Reliever study
corridor between Page Avenue in the south to the intersection of the joint use line at Old Denton
Road in the north. Additionally, the central portion of the APE includes an area to the east
toward Meacham Boulevard where new rail siding tracks will be placed between IH 35W and
Meacham Boulevard. (Figure 1). Tower 55 is located in the southwest quadrant of the IH 30/IH
35W interchange. This interchange includes the rail corridors of the Union Pacific Railroad
(UPRR), Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF), Fort Worth & Western
Railroad (FWWRR), and public rail. The Tower 55 Reliever corridor is approximately 11.37
miles long, and the right-of-way (ROW) is generally about 100–150 feet in width. The UPRR
siding track area measures 1.08 miles long and 0.40 mile wide at its maximum point. The
proposed improvements would be conducted within the current rail ROW (approximately 268
acres) and the ROW of several existing private rail spurs in the northern half of the project area
that will be purchased for the project (approximately 5 acres). In total, 273 acres were surveyed
for the current project. With the exception of the rail trench, which will have drill shafts to 100
feet and a maximum depth of 30 feet, all of the work will be at grade; in other words, the
maximum depth of the remainder of the project is 3 to 6 feet. Right-of-entry (ROE) permission
was acquired for any proposed new ROW parcels, and ROE for the UPRR and BNSF property is
in hand. The area of potential effects (APE) for the archaeological survey is confined to the
footprint of the project, the current rail ROW and the ROW of the private rail spurs to be
purchased.
The current survey was undertaken to provide baseline information for the project environmental
assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§
4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852]. This investigation was conducted to fulfill compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through
2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915], requiring cultural resources survey. In
addition, the ultimate client, NCTCOG, is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and must
comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of
Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigation was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code
permit #5160. The ultimate goal was to identify and inventory cultural resources properties
1

contained within the proposed project area APE and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL).
The NCTCOG is developing a long-range transportation plan, of which the Tower 55 Reliever
project (CSJ 0902-48-693) is a part. The proposed project improvements would improve the
movement of all trains within and around current rail infrastructure that converges on Tower 55,
with the goals of enhancing access to intermodal hubs, freight movement centers, airports, and
the foreign-trade zones in the region; reducing freight rail congestion from goods moving across
the Dallas-Fort Worth region; improving the safety and security of rail movements at Tower 55;
and increasing possible passenger rail and commuter rail operations in and around Tower 55. The
project components consist of the following:
1. Series of crossovers from Allen Street to Page Street between BNSF’s Fort Worth
Subdivision and UPRR Ney Bypass
2. Additional crossover between Rosedale Street and Magnolia Avenue on the UPRR Fort
Worth Subdivision
3. 3-Track “Trench” (approx. 8,000 feet) constructed between Rosedale Street and MLK
Freeway (Spur 280) with multiple crossovers to facilitate BNSF and UPRR movements
(requires new ROW)
4. “Trench” vertical profile closes Vickery Boulevard; 4 options being evaluated (potential
changes to vertical profile)
5. Reconstruction of Lancaster Avenue from Jones Street to Kentucky Avenue and IH 30
ramp connections due to construction of “Trench”; and maintaining the Nineteenth Street
connection (potential changes to vertical profile)
6. Bridges over trench for NW Wye, SW Wye and Dallas Subdivision connections
7. Temporary Dallas Subdivision crossovers opposite T&P Station during construction
8. New bridge parallel to TRE bridge between ITC and T&P Station for initial purposes
during construction transferring to TRE for permanent use
9. At-grade track on west side parallel to trench from Rosedale Street to Spur 280 (requires
new ROW)
10. At-grade track on east side parallel to trench along UPRR Choctaw Subdivision from
Rosedale Street to Spur 280, including NE and SE quadrant tracks at Tower 55 (requires
new ROW)
11. Widening “Hole-in-the-Wall” to allow construction of two additional tracks to create
three-track underpass benefitting both freight rail and commuter rail
12. New connections between Choctaw 1/Wichita Falls Subdivision and UPRR North Siding,
extension of BNSF Track 9598 to north and new parallel crossovers near Fourth Street;
upgrade BNSF Tracks 9598, 9599, 9501 to main line status and quality
13. New 7,600-foot track from south end of Trinity River Bridges to Fourth Street parallel to
Choctaw 1/Wichita Falls Subdivision; track will be connected to BNSF’s Fort Worth
Subdivision and BNSF’s Track 9599 by crossovers and turnouts
14. Set of crossovers at Tower 60 to facilitate train movements
15. New 8,500-foot siding track from Beach Street on the DART-owned Cotton Belt to IH
35W in a location within right-of-way (ROW) allowing for future double tracking of
SW2NE rail
16. A new grade separation of Sylvania Avenue over the Cotton Belt line with clear span of
railroad ROW (requires new ROW)

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Environmentally, the upper Trinity River basin is located in the Southern Plains and includes
three physiographic zones. Moving from east to west, these zones are the Trinity River Flood
plain Forest, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Grand Prairie (see Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31
for a treatment of the environment of the upper Trinity basin). The project area is located
predominantly in the Grand Prairie, which is characterized by black, calcareous clay soils and by
a dominance of grasses, with shrubs and trees present along stream bottoms and flood plains. The
Grand Prairie is supported by the limestone and clay formations of the Pawpaw Formation, Weno
Limestone, Denton Clay, Fort Worth Limestone, Duck Creek Formation, Goodland Limestone,
and Walnut Clay with sands introduced in alluvial settings from the Paluxy Formation farther to
the west.
The entire upper Trinity River basin, including the project area, falls within Blair’s (1950:100–
102) Texan biotic province. Yates and Ferring (1986:22) point out that the Texan province is not
so much a distinct geographic unit as it is a giant ecotone in which species from both the east and
the west overlap at the limits of their ranges. Species composition and forest density varies
greatly between the Eastern Cross Timers and the Grand Prairie. For prehistoric hunter/gatherers,
the potential for each zone to provide exploitable floral and faunal resources would have been
different from zone to zone.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The uplands of the Grand Prairie are host to small, widely scattered trees, but mature oaks and
cottonwood trees dominate the flood plain environments. Although tall grasses and forbs are
historically the principal vegetation on the prairie, urbanization and growth on the Northcentral
Texas prairie have vastly altered the flora and fauna from that which would have been available
to prehistoric populations. Many of the species growing on the prairie could have provided
nutritious nuts and fruits for prehistoric human and deer populations, but the density of these
foods was too low to have been a significant resource for human subsistence. The Grand Prairie
would have supported occasional herds of large mammals opportunistically hunted for protein
and fat, and larger mammals such as pronghorn and, later, bison may have browsed the prairie,
but in low numbers and with intermittent frequency. Complete listings of the faunal resources of
5

the upper Trinity River basin can be found elsewhere (Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31), but the
region as a whole was characterized by a high species diversity with the majority of these
resources in the bottomlands (Lynott 1977; Yates and Ferring 1986:22). The undergrowth of
berries and grasses would have provided a variety of microhabitats of exploitable floral and
faunal resources for early hunter/gatherers. In addition to the large numbers of mammals and
birds attracted to it, the riverine flood plain area was also a source of fish, turtle, waterfowl, and
shellfish for prehistoric peoples. Despite the intermittent presence of large mammal prairie
species such as buffalo and pronghorn, faunal remains recovered from archaeological contexts
indicate that deer was the primary source of meat protein throughout the prehistoric period (Yates
and Ferring 1986:27).

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology consists of Lower Cretaceous limestones, mudstone, and sandstones,
unconformably overlain by Quaternary-age fluvial, colluvial, and alluvial deposits. From south
to north, they are mapped as the Lower Cretaceous Pawpaw Formation, Weno Limestone, and
Denton Clay Undivided; Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek Formation undivided;
Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits, and Holocene Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1972). Together, this series of fossiliferous, shallow-water marine limestones, claystones, shales,
and sandstones form a package no more than 120 meters in thickness, with the bulk of the
sediment being limestone or limey shale. These units dip gently to the east into the East Texas
Embayment so the oldest units are exposed farther to the west and the youngest to the east except
where erosional downcutting has removed the younger units and so exposed the older units
sooner (Barnes 1988). Erosional sculpting of these units has produced very steep, 30–40-metertall bedrock scarps on both sides of the valley of the West Fork of the Trinity River. During the
extended period of erosion between the end of the Cretaceous and the late Quaternary, the more
erosionally resistant limestones of this sedimentary package probably served to inhibit valley
widening and formed topographic benches and knolls within the flood plain itself.
The active channel of the West Fork is very narrow in the area near the current project and is
deeply entrenched with very steep, almost vertical banks in many places; the surrounding flood
plain is located over 9 meters above the normal water level of the river. The West Fork does
appear to be highly sinuous in the vicinity of the study areas and, despite the level of alteration of
the flood plain by historic construction activities and channelization, the flood plain does have
what appears to be a considerable number of distinct, preserved fluvial topographic features such
as abandoned channels or sloughs.

SOILS
Soils in the Tower 55 Reliever study corridor area are mapped by the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service as (from south to north) those in the Sanger-Purves-Slidell association, Aledo-BolarSanger association, Frio-Trinity association, and Bastil-Silawa association (Ressel 1981). The
Sanger-Purves-Slidell soils are nearly level and gently sloping, deep and shallow, clayey soils
found on uplands. Aledo-Bolar-Sanger soils are gently sloping to moderately steep, very shallow
to deep, loamy and clayey soils found on uplands. Frio-Trinity soils are nearly level, deep, clayey
soils on flood plains, in particular, the Trinity River flood plain (Ressel 1981). The Bastil-Silawa
association soils are nearly level to sloping, deep loamy soils (Ressel 1981). Twenty-one soil
6

units are mapped within the project area with ten being either mixed with Urban Land (areas that
are 85 to 100 percent works and structures such as buildings, railroad yards, airports, streets,
sidewalks, and paved driveways (Ressel 1981:57) or Urban Land itself (Figures 2 and 3).
Moving from south to north, the non-Urban soils include Arents and Frio silty clay (Frio-Trinity
Series) within the floodplain of the West Fork crossing (see Figure 2). Although these soils
would normally be considered to be of higher probability for buried archaeology, the bridges and
their approaches spanning the West Fork will not be impacted as part of the current project and
thus soils in these areas will not be disturbed.
North of the West Fork Crossing, several non-Urban soils as part of both the Bastil-Silwa and
Frio-Trinity series are present within the ROW (see Figure 3). The soils considered to be of
highest probability for containing buried archaeological materials were within the Frio-Trinity
Series, associated with the crossings at Little Fossil and Big Fossil creeks (see Figure 3).

CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Several major reports concerning the archaeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize most of the
archaeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archaeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27–29), much of the excavation efforts within
the upper Trinity River basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner
et al. 1982) and the East Fork of the Trinity River (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and
Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations by the University of Texas
at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s
(Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and
McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have
provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the adaptations along the
West Fork of the Trinity River.
Cultural resources investigations in Tarrant County in the last decade have been limited in scope
and results. The city of Arlington, Parks and Recreation Department, sponsored a series of
projects in southeastern Tarrant County (Hunt 1991; Hunt and Krapf 1996; Hunt and Peter 1993a,
1993b, 1995, 1996a, 1996b; Hunt et al. 1994; Peter and Gaither 1990). Three small projects also
were conducted for the Fort Worth Zoo (Edwards 1991; Edwards and Peter 1991; Peter et al.
1994). In 1996, a survey was undertaken at the Westside Recycling Facility in western Tarrant
County (Hunt et al. 1996) and at a housing complex in northern Tarrant County (Krapf and Hunt
1996). In 1994, a cultural resources survey was undertaken by Geo-Marine for the proposed
replacement of the East First Street Bridge over the West Fork of the Trinity River. That project
included intensive pedestrian survey, backhoe investigations, and architectural evaluations of
standing structures. Site 41TR138, a prehistoric site with deposits to a depth of 4 meters, was
tested and recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Geo-Marine conducted additional
surveys and excavations in 1996 for the proposed Randol Mill Road extension in Fort Worth,
where site 41TR138 was again encountered. Geoarchaeological testing suggested that the site
could date as early as 4,650 years before present (yrs B.P.) and was of significance to
understanding early human adaptation in the area (Hunt and Peter 1997; Largent 1994).
13

During a 1997 survey, AR Consultants identified 41TR160, a buried prehistoric site. That project
consisted of a pedestrian survey with limited shovel tests and backhoe trenching conducted in the
route of anticipated pipeline construction (Skinner et al. 1997:Figure 3). Thirteen trenches were
excavated in select locations along the route to identify buried cultural and geological deposits.
Freshwater mussel shell was found eroding out of a sump and was also seen in the gully created
by an earlier pipeline excavation. Trenches were placed west of the earlier pipeline excavation to
locate the source of the mussel shells. Mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and large mammal bones
were found below 1 meter in the trenches. Skinner surmised that the site deposit could extend to
the west as far as 35 meters to the sump edge, but no more than 4 meters to the northeast toward
Trench 11 where no cultural materials were encountered. Bison and deer were represented in the
faunal collection. Two chert flakes, fire-cracked rock, animal bone, and mussel shell were found
at 1.22 meters below surface. Fire-cracked limestone was found at 2.2 meters below the surface
(Skinner et al. 1997).
In 1995, AR Consultants conducted cultural resources investigations along the West Fork in
Grand Prairie, Dallas County. Survey and shovel tests revealed no cultural resources, though
archaeological monitoring of construction was recommended (Trask et al. 1995). Two
investigations in the city of Arlington in Tarrant County reported cultural resources deposits on
the Metrovest Development property, bound on the west by FM 157 and on the east by the Trinity
River (Ferring and Byers 1996; Shaunessy et al. 1994). An additional investigation reported
cultural resources just west of FM 157 at the Trinity River Linear Park in Arlington (Ferring
1994). Though both properties had been heavily mined for river gravels, the studies investigated
a total of 10 historic and prehistoric deposits on the north, central, and west sides of the parcel.
At the Trinity River Linear Park, Ferring (1994) reported four prehistoric sites (41TR143–
41TR146) buried in the flood plain. The sites consisted primarily of charcoal, shell, and bone,
with some fire-cracked rock and a few stone flakes. Cultural resources deposits were observed at
depths ranging from 0.25 meter to over 5 meters below surface. Ferring estimated the age of the
sites at between 750 and 3,000 yrs B.P. He concluded that despite low artifact density, the sites
were significant examples of occupation in aggrading fluvial environments.
Following the Linear Park project, two newly discovered sites on the Metrovest property (now
the Lakes of Arlington development area), 41TR142 and 41TR141, were investigated and
recorded. Previously recorded site 41TR128—most likely destroyed by gravel quarrying over the
past years—consisted of the historic-era Bird’s Fort and prehistoric components ranging from the
Late Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric periods (Shaunessy et al. 1994:11). Shaunessy et al. (1994)
concluded that the land immediately west of the West Fork, in addition to several other small,
undisturbed portions, had a high potential for yielding buried cultural resources and
recommended backhoe testing. Ferring and Byers (1996) also felt that the flood plains on the east
edge of the Metrovest property exhibited a high potential for preserving cultural remains.
Investigations of site 41TR142 to the west revealed an occupation surface, including artifacts,
fauna, and a hearth, at roughly 140 cm below surface. Evidence suggested primarily Late
Archaic occupation, with some Late Prehistoric artifacts. Ferring considered both site 41TR142
and the potential deposits in the narrow strip of undisturbed flood plain along the West Fork to be
significant in their preservation, complexity, and contributions to paleoenvironmental
reconstruction. He strongly encouraged the protection of these areas from subsurface
disturbance.

14

In 1998, Ellis (1998) surveyed a 3-mile linear segment of the Metrovest property for the
development of a hike-and-bike trail that was developed with funds from the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). He encountered a scatter of buried archaeological deposits along the
3-mile length of the riverbank throughout the Metrovest property that he inclusively designated as
site 41TR167. The observed cultural deposits ranged from roughly 50–350 cm below surface and
contained mainly burned earth and shell lenses, with very sparse bone, lithic artifacts, or burned
rock. Essentially, the length of the site encompassed the entire proposed hike-and-bike project
area, even though relatively discrete clusters of cultural materials were recorded. Ellis’s
designation of the entire left-bank-stretch of river as a single site without specific loci made it
difficult to manage or interpret prehistoric behaviors within the expansive site area. A
radiocarbon date from a deposit roughly 1 meter below the terrace tread surface at the western
end of the site indicated that the upper portion of the terrace was occupied 940–1160 years ago
(Ellis 1998). Nevertheless, the significance of this date is overwhelmed by the expanse of the site
and the number of discrete occupations in the deposits.
In 1999, Geo-Marine conducted a survey that included backhoe excavations of an alluvial terrace
setting along the proposed TRA 72-inch sewer pipeline (Burson et al. 2000). Burson’s survey
resulted in the identification of a large, diffuse site, 41TR174, during the trenching of flood plain
deposits on the left bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River. Backhoe trenching demonstrated
that cultural deposits extended from approximately 80 cm to 200 cm below surface, located
entirely within the ubiquitous Pilot Point alloformation and its associated West Fork paleosol as
defined by Ferring (1990, 1994; and Ferring and Byers 1996). The site yielded quantities of
burned rock, burned clay, charcoal, shell, and mammal and fish bones. A radiocarbon assay of
charcoal collected during the survey from approximately 130 cm below surface in survey
Backhoe Trench 2 at site 41TR174 indicated that the cultural deposits were 1,530–1,735 years old
(Burson et al. 2000).
It was later discovered that site 41TR174 actually occurs within the northeastern part of Ellis’s 3mile-long (5-kilometer) site 41TR167. Nevertheless, the portion of the site dated by Ellis for
TxDOT is located at the extreme opposite end of site 41TR167 and some 5 kilometers southwest
of site 41TR174. During 2003, Geo-Marine was contracted to conduct testing at 41TR174 prior
to the pipeline installation (Lintz et al. 2004). Testing included monitoring mechanical Gradall
excavations and opening manual excavation units around observed features or occupation zones.
The 2003 project resulted in the identification of three distinct buried cultural zones. Six hearth
and discard features were identified within one of these cultural zones designated as Analytical
Zone II. Despite the presence of these buried features, however, the absence of diagnostic
materials and the low quantities of archaeological materials were an indication that the
occupation being investigated was too sparse to be considered eligible for inclusion in the
National Register or for designation as a Texas SAL.
Geo-Marine conducted investigations in 2002 on the Riverside Oxbow Project through the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (Huhnke and Wurtz 2004). That project included
shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and pedestrian survey of a portion of the West Fork flood plain
in Fort Worth. Those investigations resulted in the identification of 41TR198, an 11-acre site
dating to the Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric periods. Buried components of this site yielded
four hearth-like features containing bone, mussel shell, and chipped stone between 50 and 200 cm
below surface. This site, although sparsely tested, exhibits a density of cultural materials that
exceeds many other previously identified sites in the region bearing similar assemblages and
retains great research potential. Geo-Marine began mitigation work at site 41TR198 in January
2009 and analyses are currently ongoing.
15

In 2005, Geo-Marine conducted test excavations at site 41TR170 prior to the construction of a
portion of the proposed State Highway 121 over the Clear Fork of the Trinity River (Lintz et al.
2008). A three-stage tactic was taken in testing the site: archaeological monitoring of the
mechanical excavation of 28 backhoe trenches with geomorphological studies conducted; manual
excavation of 10 test units; and mechanical scraping to target occupation surfaces and the
excavation of three blocks. A series of low-density, highly stratified occupations dating to the
Transitional Archaic period was encountered, and though site context, integrity, and preservation
was good, the paucity of remains was generally insufficient to provide adequate data to address
significant regional research questions. The site was recommended ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no additional investigations recommended.
Projects in the immediate vicinity or within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of this current project,
according to the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas included a 1991
TxDOT survey for the widening of Beach Street from IH 820 to Long Avenue. No
archaeological evidence was noted (Weir 1991). TxDOT also conducted a small survey for the
Hemphill Street extension and construction in 1993; no sites were recorded (Weir 1993). In
2008, AR Consultants, Inc., conducted a reconnaissance survey for a bridge/culvert replacement
at 28th Street over an unnamed drainage. No sites or remains were identified (Davis 2008). Two
other surveys were noted on the Atlas, but unfortunately, no additional information was available.
In 2005 and 2006, Geo-Marine (Osburn and Shanabrook 2005; Shanabrook et al. 2007) utilized
geoarchaeological coring as a preliminary assessment of the potential for cultural resources
within the Central City hydraulic mitigation areas associated with flood plain development along
the West Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth (Shanabrook et al. 2007). Approximately 291
noncontiguous acres divided into three discrete zones—hydraulic mitigation (Zone 3A), dam
construction (Zone 3B), and recreation (Zone 3C)—were examined through intensive coring.
These high-potential areas were in or adjacent to former meander belts of the West Fork. In
addition, three sites (41TR202 and 41TR203 in Zone 3C; 41TR204 in Zone 3A) were identified
during the coring investigations, and one previously recorded site (41TR160) was revisited in
Zone 3A. Each site was identified by cultural materials that were located stratigraphically within
or just below the West Fork Paleosol. Based on the apparent age of the sediments observed and
the location of the cultural materials observed below or in the basal portion of the West Fork
Paleosol, it seemed likely that the cultural materials observed date to the latter half of the
Holocene. None has received adequate investigations to date to determine NRHP eligibility and
all have been recommended for further work as the Central City project proceeds.

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Prehistoric Framework
Despite a long history of archaeological research in Northcentral Texas and the Southern Plains
(Jelks 1967; Krieger 1946, 1947; Prewitt 1981, 1985), as well as several recent summary
overviews (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Vehik 1994), the chronological
framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed. The available data allow the
delineation of only a generalized chronology. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for the Late Prehistoric
period, although the overall regional applicability of the phases recognized there is still in some
16

dispute. Prikryl (1990) presented a chronological sequence of six periods, but he relied almost
entirely on diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant
from the upper Trinity River basin. Despite this, chronological data from recent excavations at
Ray Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake reportedly conform well to his suggested sequence
(Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998).
The prehistoric chronology presented here (Table 1) is taken from the introduction to the regional
preservation plan for the Prairie-Savanna Archeological Region, of which the upper Trinity River
basin is a part (Prikryl 1993). A brief summary of the adaptations and archaeological remains
associated with these periods is presented below.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9950–6500 B.C.) generally includes those
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for recent reviews relevant to this period in Northcentral Texas, see Hofman
1989a; Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation
of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from
surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever
1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example of typical
site contexts (Jensen 1968). Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl
(1990) has suggested that the most common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview
and Dalton. Ferring and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to about 9,500–10,000 years
ago, based on cross dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond
with the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the Trinity River valley.
Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best-known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths, and a low density of artifacts, including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early
age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 yrs B.P.), more recent work by the Smithsonian Institution
17

(Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation
there. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel
or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually
accepted date of 12,000–10,000 yrs B.P. for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable
estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
A more spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral
Texas is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of this site, buried
approximately 7–8 meters below the top of the Elm Fork flood plain just below the Lake Ray
Roberts dam, suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be
found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations.
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group
mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of
presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith
1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of megafauna
by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar
animals in Northcentral Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Slaughter and Hoover
1963), has resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that big game hunting was part of the
Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. However, the recent important
excavations at the Aubrey site have indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game
animals alone. Rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used by the occupants of
the site, including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989; Ferring
and Yates 1997). Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, mammoth exploitation
has not been substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized
foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern
Woodlands and the focus on now extinct, big-game species is more characteristic of a Plains
adaptation remains to be documented; but Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general, the
Clovis people probably employed “very flexible adaptive strategies.”

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle,
and late subdivisions, has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990, 1993). Thus, the
Early Archaic has been dated from 6500 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700. Relatively recent overviews that
cover the Archaic period in this portion of Texas include Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and
Story (1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently
mixed with later material. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based
upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are
no longer recognized as being acceptable for this area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988;
Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends that have been proposed as characterizing
18

the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas include an increasing complexity of settlement systems,
increasing population size and density, decreasing mobility, and the development of distinct
group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6500–4000 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined
territories, with a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story
1985:35, 39). Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly
documented, and no sites with isolatable Early Archaic components in this area are known
(Prikryl 1990). Based on surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized huntingand-gathering economy during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization,
and “little in the way of recognized territorial boundaries” (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point
forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northcentral Texas include Early Split
Stemmed and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). In comparison to the
Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (4000–1500 B.C.) is even less
well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for any other period,
but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional cultural differences
by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the
Middle Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice),
Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). An intact Middle
Archaic component was identified at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts by Ferring
and Yates (1997) and is summarized as follows:
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier Middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the [Middle Archaic] period are evident [Ferring and Yates 1997:305].

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (ca. 1500 B.C.–A.D. 700). Evidence for this can be found in an apparent increase in the
number of Late Archaic sites, a greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of
decreasing group mobility (Prikryl 1990). At the same time, interregional contact may have
diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to unequal
destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing use of
all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic period
occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of buried
sites are also known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring 1990:51). Dart points that may
be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time period and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbit, turtle, and
mussel being primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). In summarizing the results of
investigations at a number of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) state:
19

The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr B.P.) of
the [Late Archaic] period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits
our understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these are
recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are clear.
Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the [Middle
Archaic] period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points,
while local raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite
quite good resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses. . . .

The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland Creek
and Chambers Creek drainages (Bruseth and Martin 1987) also suggests that important
sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the
significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca.
A.D. 700–1700) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period
be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and is
associated with the appearance of shell-tempered Nocona Plain ceramics, various unstemmed
triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), and Perdiz points (Lynott 1977;
Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period
(Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows:
There are no woodland-like sites in north-central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland
influence/contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were
found with [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These
appear to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation
compared to the Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these
20

occupations are essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological
information, rather than environmental change, probably is the factor behind the [Late Archaic] to
[Late Prehistoric] shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
that lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr B.P. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] faunas indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a “middle
subperiod” of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that
arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies
three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle
subperiod—the Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek in
the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34MA15) on the Red
River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that
maize is common at Haley’s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are
representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial
dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication
1999).
Although no one can dispute the presence of domesticates at Cobb-Pool and Haley’s Point, the
lack of any evidence for Late Prehistoric agriculture at Ray Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake
leaves open the question of how extensive and how early this agricultural pattern was. Maize
agriculture is known to have been present at Late Prehistoric sites along the East Fork, based on
the recovery of maize from the Hogge Bridge, Butler Hole, and Campbell’s Hole sites earlier
during this century (Stephenson 1952:305), but the dating of these remains has always been
uncertain (Prikryl 1990:77). As late as 1993, the available data allowed Fritz (1993:241) to state
that, apart from Cobb-Pool, Late Prehistoric sites in Northcentral Texas seemed to show a
generalized adaptation in which the most important plant foods were nuts, wild seeds, fruits, and
the problematic, possible tuber that might be a species of Psoralea. Since then, several small
projects have shed additional light on the introduction of maize horticulture into Northcentral
Texas. The Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork
of the Trinity River) yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by AMS analysis of bone
collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present, and a stable carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ indicates
that the group’s diet contained little or no maize (Cliff et al. 1996; cf. Lynott et al. 1986:Figure 2).
More recently, a disturbed burial (41DL373), located on Spring Creek (a tributary of Rowlett
Creek), was dated by AMS analysis of bone collagen to cal. A.D. 1155 (1220) 1275, with a stable
carbon isotope ratio of -17.8 ‰ (Peter and Clow 1999). This value is similar to stable carbon
isotope values believed to represent the initial introduction of maize agriculture in New York
around A.D. 1000 (van der Merwe and Vogel 1977) and is comparable to values of -18.0 ‰ to 20.0 ‰ for initial maize-consuming Caddo populations in Arkansas (Rose and Hoffman 1989).
21

Assuming that (1) these carbon isotope ratios directly reflect changes in the C4 plant contribution
to the human diet (see Herz 1990 for a discussion of other possibilities), and (2) these burials are
representative of more regional changes in prehistoric dietary patterns, then maize horticulture
may have been introduced into Northcentral Texas around A.D. 1200.

Historic Indian Period
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1700 to 1850 has been designated the Historic
Indian period (Prikryl 1993). Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European
presence in the Southwest and on the Southern Plains was sporadic at best (Coronado in 1540–
1541, the Rodriguez-Chamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582–1583, etc.). After 1598, Spanish
influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans
continued to be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area
(Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century
that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace. This was
the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians
to the north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725–
1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains,
known as the High Plains. After this time, the Comanche and Kiowa increasingly controlled the
area. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the
early historic period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and
amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the
aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains, including Northcentral Texas,
were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the
south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino,
encountered by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan
speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, apparently located at that time “on the Blackland Prairies between the
Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco”
(Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas
were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other
Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita
proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe. However, some
were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined
amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries.
The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
22

were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas
River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their
villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the
Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos
rivers. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages
was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of Dallas-Fort Worth (John
1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with
the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until
1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south
of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith
1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity
from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but
returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman
1989b:95).
Archaeological remains that can be associated with these early historic groups are rare compared
to the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of these
historic Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American sites with
European items (Sollberger 1953).

Historic Occupation/Utilization
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have been in 1542, when the remnants
of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered modern Texas
in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition
crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much
farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986;
Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until
the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River.
The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they
responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native
Americans in East and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France
ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the
security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern
Texas. More important, from the Native American viewpoint, was the severe military defeat
inflicted on the Spanish by Wichita and allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758. It
has been argued that this defeat put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the
north (Weddle 1964, 1965).
The first Euro-Americans to settle in the region were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The
settlement of Bird’s Fort, established in 1840, was the first permanent settlement in the DallasFort Worth area and was established by Captain Jonathan Bird. Located along the West Fork of
the Trinity River in present-day Arlington, the fort consisted of a blockhouse and several log
buildings and served mostly as a trading station. Additional families joined the initial occupants
23

of the fort in the fall of 1841, but the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Bird’s Fort was
not used again until the summer of 1843 when Sam Houston, President of the Republic of Texas,
attempted to meet with the Indian tribes and establish a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on
September 29, 1843, with representatives of the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Keechi, Caddo,
Ionic, Biloxi, and Cherokee present (Garrett 1972; Sergeant 1953). The settlement of Birdville,
located between Little Fossil Creek and Big Fossil Creek, was founded in 1848 12 miles to the
southeast soon after Bird’s Fort was abandoned.
Meanwhile, in 1841, the Republic of Texas had granted a large portion of land to the Texas
Emigration and Land Company (TELC), which hoped to encourage settlement of Northcentral
Texas. The grants distributed to settlers by the TELC became known collectively as the Peters
Colony. The majority of the Peters Colony settlers held property north of Dallas, which they held
in that name until 1852 when disputes between the TELC and the settlers caused some of the
settlers to band together to defend their title to the land they had settled.
In 1845, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Springs (later named Mary Le Bone
Springs) along Johnson Creek (formerly called Mill Creek). Although Carol Werdman’s
(1969:10) account of its location suggests either a Rush Creek or Johnson Creek location, an 1872
map of Texas (Petermann 1872) places Marrow Bone Springs on Johnson Creek. Colonel
Middleton Tate Johnson and a company of Texas Rangers also established their headquarters at
Marrow Bone Springs in 1847. Two years later Colonel Johnson received a land grant for his
services, and he established a plantation near Marrow Bone Springs. The community that grew
around the colonel’s plantation came to be known as Johnson Station.
On June 6, 1849, the United States Army established Camp Worth on the bluffs overlooking the
Trinity River, near present day Samuels Avenue. Major Ripley Arnold selected the site of the
installation, which served as a post along the army’s frontier defense line. The fort’s location
atop a high bluff provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area, and an increased
measure of security as a result (Selcer 2004:4). Despite undergoing a change in name from
“Camp Worth” to “Fort Worth” in November 1849, the installation at Fort Worth was not a
walled or substantially fortified structure as the name may imply. Soldiers did construct
buildings within the installation, however. In 1853 when the army’s frontier defense line shifted
west, the army withdrew its troops from Fort Worth and turned the installation over to a
population of less than 100 civilian settlers who moved into the abandoned structures and adapted
them for their own use (Selcer 2004:7–9).
In the early days of Fort Worth, despite the fact that the military installation had been abandoned
in 1853, the population of the frontier town continued to grow, due to the prevalence of water and
fertile land. An important step in connecting the town to a larger transportation network was the
commencement of regular stage service from Fort Belknap, northwest of Fort Worth near presentday Newcastle, and Dallas in 1857 (Selcer 2004:10–11). The first stage line to connect with Fort
Worth was the United States Mail Stage Line in 1856, and in 1858, Fort Worth became an
overnight rest stop on the Fort Worth-Jacksboro Stage Line, which connected to the Butterfield
Overland Stage that linked St. Louis to the West Coast (Sanders 1986:24; Schmelzer 1985). By
1860, Fort Worth’s population had grown to 450 (Roark 1991:5). In the wake of its being voted
as the county seat in 1860, settlement increased and spread from the town center (just west of the
present-day location of the Tarrant County Courthouse) to the south and northeast along the
bluffs.

24

Fort Worth’s population decreased significantly during the Civil War. By 1865, the population
had been reduced by nearly half from 1860 (Roark 1991:5; Sanders 1986:29). Development of
the town was stagnant during this time, but, unlike many former Confederate strongholds, Fort
Worth began to reshape its economy and identity relatively quickly after the Civil War. After the
war, prosperity returned to Fort Worth with the beginning of cattle drives through the area.
Following the war’s end, a great demand for Texas beef developed in northern states, as the war
had depleted the livestock population in that region (Campbell 2003:297). In April 1866, the first
contract cattle drive from South Texas to Missouri passed through Fort Worth. The town served
as a final stopover for the cattle drives heading from South Texas to shipping depots in Oklahoma
and Kansas along the Eastern Trail. The capital that cowboys brought to Fort Worth greatly
aided the city’s economic recovery.
The 1870s were a time of important developments in Fort Worth. In 1870, streets were surveyed
southward from Courthouse Square and assigned numbers from First Street to Tenth Street. On
February 17, 1873, the state legislature signed Fort Worth’s charter of incorporation, and the
town formally became a city with an area of approximately 4 square miles (Selcer 2004:19). In
response to its incorporation and in anticipation of the railroad’s imminent arrival, Fort Worth
again enjoyed a population and economic boom in the early 1870s with the population rising to
5,000 (Federal Writers’ Project, Writers’ Program [Texas] 1940:260).
Because the Trinity River created a natural barrier to early development to the north of
downtown, the southern and southeastern sections of the city developed relatively early in the
city’s history, beginning roughly concurrent with Fort Worth’s incorporation in 1873 (Knight
1990:198). The city’s southern boundary in 1873 included the stretch of Terrell Avenue between
Eighth Avenue to the west and Virginia Avenue to the east (Historic Preservation Council for
Tarrant County [HPCTC] 1986:2), thus crossing the Tower 55 APE. The line did not necessarily
reflect the extent of the city’s development, but rather the potential city officials hoped would be
realized with the arrival of the railroad (HPCTC 1986:2). The financial crisis of 1873 delayed
railroad construction and put boom hopes on hold for a few years, but the city rebounded, both
economically and population-wise, when railroad plans were finalized.

Arrival of the Railroad and Fort Worth’s Corresponding Growth
Throughout Texas, the railroads catalyzed the statewide population growth and economic boom
after the Civil War and continuing through the early twentieth century, when the railroads were
integral to the distribution of local products (Campbell 2003:309). Railroads proved essential to
the expansion of the city’s industrial growth, therefore essential to its long-term financial
stability. Each of the industries that developed in Fort Worth in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, namely the city’s meatpacking industry, lumber yards, and oil manufacturing
companies, relied on the railroad system in order to thrive, which in turn drove the city’s physical
growth.
The Texas & Pacific Railroad (T&P) reached Fort Worth on July 19, 1876, five years after
Congress granted it a charter to construct its transcontinental line (Selcer 2004:20). The T&P was
the only railroad in the state of Texas to operate under a charter granted by the federal
government (Campbell 2003:306). At the south end of the city, E. M. Daggett donated
approximately 90 acres of his family farm to entice the Texas & Pacific to build a line through
Fort Worth. The city constructed a train station on part of the land and opened a streetcar line
from the station to the public square (Selcer 2004:21).
25

After the success of the T&P, city boosters continued to sell Fort Worth as a terminus to the many
railroad companies that were being organized in the 1880s and after (Jackson 1996). The number
of lines coming into Fort Worth grew rapidly: Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe (1881); MissouriKansas-Texas (1881); Fort Worth and New Orleans, soon after acquired by the Houston and
Texas Central (1886); St. Louis, San Francisco and Texas (1887); Fort Worth and Denver (1888);
and Fort Worth and Rio Grande (ca. 1889). Historically, the Fort Worth and Denver tracks ran
parallel with the Chicago, Rock Island, and Gulf (chartered in 1902) and followed along Samuels
Avenue. At present, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific railroads own and operate
the historic tracks.
Much like the West and Clear forks of the Trinity River, railroad tracks served as dividers forcing
the growing city of Fort Worth into distinct sections: industry was concentrated along the river
and the tracks; commercial and civic activities remained primarily in the downtown area; and
residential development was being built everywhere else—between the tracks and downtown,
downtown and the river, between the tracks and the stockyards, and in the additions south of the
T&P line in the area of the current APE. By 1890, 11 railroad lines ran through Fort Worth, and
city officials donated approximately 300 acres at the south end of the city as a “Railroad
Reservation” on which the Texas & Pacific constructed its terminal and other supporting
structures.
By the end of the 1880s, the city’s economy was strengthened and stabilized by dozens of mills,
factories, foundries, and other facilities (Knight 1990:125). The growing population reflected the
economic prosperity. Fort Worth’s population had been approximately 500 in 1870, but by 1890
had grown to 23,076 (Campbell 2003:308).
Fort Worth maps drawn by D. D. Morse in 1876, 1886, and 1891 depict the evolution of the built
environment in the vicinity of the Tower 55 APE in the decades during the railroad boom. The
Morse maps illustrate the city’s growth due to the railroads and cattle industry, providing
essential information on the railroads’ ancillary buildings, related industrial and commercial
development, and residential settlement. His bird’s-eye map of Fort Worth in 1876, with a view
looking southeast, shows the concentration of buildings in the central business district and along
the bluffs, with limited development beyond Pecan and Ninth streets. Despite the fact that the
T&P Railway first arrived in Fort Worth on July 19, 1876, Morse’s map, drawn in April, depicts
a T&P train chugging into town along Sixteenth Street, with a handful of associated buildings
flanking the tracks.
Morse rotated the view for his 1886 and 1891 maps so they look southwest, illustrating the
extensive industrial development along the tracks, the arrival of additional rail lines, and the
resultant housing boom. The 1886 map features an inset with a version of the famed “Tarantula”
map depicting Fort Worth at the center with rail lines extending in all directions like a spider’s
legs. Jackson (1996) discusses the evolution of the “Tarantula” map in Fort Worth’s rise from
cowtown to major railroad terminus to industrial and manufacturing center by the end of World
War I. Illustrated in the final Morse map, neighborhood development south of the T&P line is
significant: houses, churches, and a few commercial enterprises are depicted as far south as
Leuda Street. The 1891 bird’s-eye view shows expanded rail lines and yards paralleling Jones
Street, larger industrial buildings along the T&P line south of downtown, and increased
residential density in the south and near-southeast neighborhoods.

26

Rail companies also built passenger stations in Fort Worth befitting the city’s newfound status
and projecting an impressive image for the company. At the turn of the twentieth century, an
estimated 50 passenger trains traveled through Fort Worth every day (Cashion 2006:24). The
volume of rail traffic required companies to invest in expanded facilities. In 1899, the Gulf,
Colorado, and Santa Fe built a large red brick and limestone terminal building at Fourteenth and
Jones streets, which was expanded in 1931 to include a new freight building (THC 1970). The
complex now serves as the Fort Worth Amtrak Station. In 1900, T&P built the first of its
monumental terminal buildings, a large red brick structure, on the property the city donated to the
company in 1873. After a fire destroyed the T&P terminal in 1904, it was promptly rebuilt
(Cashion 2006:24). The red brick terminal building was replaced in 1931 by a 13-story terminal
building designed by architect Wyatt C. Hedrick, on property adjacent to the original T&P
reservation.
As of 1891, the T&P line ran along what was, at the time, the southern city limit near Terrell
Avenue. The railroad’s location forced the focus of the city south, and development began to
“jump the tracks” and extend beyond the city boundaries (Knight 1990; Roark 1991; Schmelzer
1985). In the southern section of the project APE, the key to neighborhood growth at the outset
was the city’s annexation of the area. With annexation came city services including police and
fire protection, graveled streets, and water and sewer services (Cashion 2006:20). The other
essential element to residential living in the area was the establishment of the streetcar system
with mule-drawn cars in the 1880s and then electric cars circa 1890. Once the neighborhoods
moved beyond “paper subdivisions,” support services such as churches, schools, and commercial
enterprises helped create miniature towns within the larger urban infrastructure (HPCTC 1986:3).
Because Fort Worth served as a railroad hub, the numerous lines had to construct machine shops,
storage facilities, and other ancillary structures necessary to maintain operating schedules. As
indicated by both the Morse bird’s-eye maps and Rich’s (2006) account of the financial growth of
Fort Worth at the turn of the twentieth century, the railroad played an integral role in the city’s
industrial development. The railroad tracks were lined with manufacturing plants, lumber yards,
warehouses, and other storage and processing facilities. In 1880, Fort Worth’s population
numbered 6,663 and by 1890, the number had reached 23,076 (Rich 2006:279). In the wake of
this staggering 246 percent increase in population, housing necessarily increased dramatically,
with residential land usage in the southern section of the project area focused on working-class
and middle-class families (Historic Fort Worth, Inc. [HFW] 2001:1).
The northern project area near Samuels Avenue was settled primarily by the upper class and,
though earliest settlement dates to the 1850s and it is the home of Fort Worth’s earliest cemetery,
the area developed extensively in the wake of the railroad’s arrival (North Fort Worth Historical
Society [NFWHS 1977:3]. The Samuels Avenue neighborhood was developed from the 1870s to
the 1920s. At the southern end of Samuels Avenue is Pioneers Rest Cemetery, the city’s oldest,
officially established in 1870, but with burials dating back to 1850. Traders Oak Park, the site of
the Daggett and Leonard trading post, is also located in this neighborhood. Many of the lots are
long and deep, overlooking the Trinity River. Many early prominent citizens including
physicians, merchants, and businessmen lived on Samuels Avenue, which was a convenient
distance from both the central business district and the Fort Worth Stockyards, close enough for
easy streetcar access, but far enough to avoid the smells of the stockyards. When the Swift and
Armor meatpacking companies reenergized the Fort Worth economy in the early 1900s, Samuels
Avenue became a thoroughfare linking downtown and the stockyards. The only resources within
the current APE that are located near the Samuels Avenue neighborhood are the railroad tracks
themselves and several railroad bridges.
27

South of the T&P tracks, a number of neighborhoods developed around the turn of the twentieth
century, including the Fairmount-Southside (Historic District, NRHP), Near Southeast (Historic
District, NRHP), Elizabeth Boulevard (Historic District, NRHP), and Terrell Heights (city of Fort
Worth local designation). The 375-acre Fairmount-Southside Historic District was initially
planned as a middle-class neighborhood, but it soon became working class as vast numbers of
employment opportunities opened up in the city in the early 1900s. Roughly bounded by
Magnolia Avenue, Travis Avenue, Jessamine Street, and Hurley Avenue, the area features singlefamily houses, apartment buildings, and commercial development concentrated along Magnolia
Avenue. Residential development features uniform setbacks, wood-framed bungalow and foursquare houses, and narrow lots (HPCTC 1986:8).
Initially planned as a working-class neighborhood, the Near Southeast Historic District evolved
quickly into an exclusively African-American area, regardless of economic status. HFW notes
that the area, centered on East Terrell Avenue, was home to teachers, doctors, laborers, office
workers, and domestics (HFW 2001:1). Businesses are typically located on major thoroughfares
including Evans Avenue, and the area boasts a number of churches and schools scattered
throughout.
Elizabeth Boulevard Historic District, just east of the project APE between Eighth and College
avenues, is a residential enclave planned in 1911 for the upper class (Roark 2003:72). A local
developer, John C. Ryan, coordinated the efforts of a number of architects with an eye toward
creating a City Beautiful-type urban neighborhood reflecting a range of architectural styles and
building materials (HPCTC 1986:7). This district was Fort Worth’s first listed district on the
National Register, added in 1979.
The increased residential development on the south side of the city during the early 1900s was
reflective of the overall growth of the city and its various industries. By the late 1920s, rail traffic
through Fort Worth had increased to the point that larger facilities and infrastructure were
required to accommodate the continuously increasing volume of both passenger and freight traffic
through the city. In 1928 John L. Lancaster, President of T&P, together with the Fort Worth City
Council and Mayor William Bryce initiated a joint effort to expand T&P facilities and make
improvements to existing rail and vehicular traffic infrastructure where expanded sections of rails
were needed. Texas & Pacific financed the construction of the Lancaster Yards, a new terminal,
and warehouse facilities, while the city, using funds from a municipal bond election held
specifically to secure funding for the effort, financed the construction of a series of road
underpasses at relocated tracks (Minor 1983; THC 1978). The Texas & Pacific Terminal
Complex designed by architect Wyatt C. Hedrick consists of a 13-story passenger terminal and
both in-freight and out-freight warehouse buildings. The terminal complex was listed on the
National Register in 1978. Many of the road underpasses constructed at that time are extant, and
two are located within the current Tower 55 APE.
The construction completed by T&P and the city of Fort Worth facilitated an era of tremendous
prosperity for the railroads in Fort Worth for both passenger and freight service, and provided
facilities to support the evolving interface between rail and vehicular traffic. By 1936, there were
35 motor freight lines and 14 motor bus lines operating out of Fort Worth (Byars 1936). A
newspaper article from that year estimated that over a million pounds of freight were distributed
each day out of Fort Worth, transported within a 250-mile radius via motor freight lines. At the
same time, passenger service was bustling, with a train or bus departing Fort Worth
approximately every 12 minutes, 24 hours a day. It seemed at that time that rail and vehicular
28

traffic were developing in cooperative harmony in Fort Worth, with each mode flourishing with
the city’s role as a transportation hub.
The growing motor freight transportation industry required the construction of facilities at which
goods from the railroad could be offloaded, stored (if need be), and loaded onto motor freight
trucks, which would then transport the goods to their ultimate destination. The amount of freight
transported to and from Fort Worth required numerous facilities, and several warehouses located
south of the T&P terminal and northeast of the Santa Fe Depot served as distribution centers for
freight arriving on the railroad. In the vicinity of the current Tower 55 APE, numerous motor
freight warehouses are represented along Vickery Boulevard, Jones Street, and Daggett Avenue.
The primary intersection for rail lines traveling along the north–south rail corridor and those
traveling along the east–west corridor through Fort Worth was, and continues to be, a point
immediately southeast of downtown Fort Worth, approximately three blocks east of the
intersection of Vickery Boulevard and South Main Street. The intersection of individual rail lines
at right angles is known as an interlocker. Prior to the widespread use of remotely controlled
switch operation in the railroad industry, railroads employed individuals to monitor interlockers
and control the flow of rail traffic through the intersection. In order to provide better visibility to
those monitoring interlockers, multistory structures known as signal towers or interlocker towers,
were constructed near the interlockers (Berg 1893). The towers provided not only visibility to
operators, but also housed levers used to operate switches that controlled the train traffic through
the interlocker.
Legislation regulating the construction and operation of interlockers was first introduced in Texas
in 1901. At that time, the state legislature passed an act requiring railroad companies to install
interlockers and other safety devices approved by the Railroad Commission of Texas within one
year of the act’s passing. In 1902, the Railroad Commission established regulations requiring a
formal process for the commission to review and approve plans submitted by each railroad
company for the construction of interlocking plants (History of Interlocking Towers in Texas
2005). Often, the interlocking controls were housed in a shelter, typically a tower as discussed
above, but plans submitted to the Railroad Commission did not detail plans for the building itself;
rather, the plans focused on the layout and operation of tracks, signals, and switches controlled by
the interlocking mechanism, though footprints of the buildings are present on many plans
(Railroad Commission of Texas n.d.).
Since the early 1900s, two different towers have been located at the interlocker southeast of
downtown Fort Worth. The current Tower 55 was built in 1941 and replaced an earlier tower
built in 1904. Railroad Commission records consulted for this study indicate the earlier tower,
like the present Tower 55, was located in the southeast quadrant of the interlocker and had a
hipped roof and rectangular footprint. The 1904 tower was oriented lengthwise from west to east,
where the present tower is oriented lengthwise from south to north. Correspondence from T&P to
the Railroad Commission in 1941 state that the old plant [tower] would be abandoned and the
new plant constructed “using however certain amount of old material” (Gammie 1941:np).
Though extant, the present Tower 55 building is no longer used to monitor the interlocker, a job
that is now done remotely. The tower was decommissioned in 1995 and now serves the Union
Pacific police (U. P. Crossroads 1998). The interlocker at Tower 55 is currently the busiest atgrade rail intersection in the country (NCTCOG 2009).

29

The Highway System in Fort Worth
Since the arrival of the railroad in 1876 and its subsequent expansion, the other primary factor
dictating changes in land use within the project APE is the development of the highway system in
Fort Worth. For many years, streetcars served as the primary mode of transportation for many of
Fort Worth’s residents. Slowly, throughout the 1920s, bus lines began to replace streetcar routes,
and by 1938 a fleet of 140 buses serviced the city of Fort Worth, while remaining streetcars were
slowly sold and tracks removed (Cashion 2006:81). As the streetcar (as the primary mode of
transportation) declined in popularity and automobile ownership began to increase, road
improvements were necessary to facilitate travel in Fort Worth and to neighboring regions.
Highway 183 served as an early route connecting Fort Worth and Dallas. The road was jacketed
with concrete in 1950 just as early suburbs such as Hurst began to develop along the corridor
(Cashion 2006:103). Built during the apex of 1950s federally funded highway projects, the
Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike (now part of IH 30) opened in 1957, running approximately parallel
and just south of the original T&P line (now Union Pacific). The turnpike intersected with
IH 35W northeast of Tower 55; the network of feeder roads and on-ramps at the interchange were
popularly known as the Mixmaster, and resembled the network of intersecting rails to the
southwest. In 1959, Fort Worth Magazine boasted, “Eight important federal and state highways
fall out in every direction [from Fort Worth]” (FW 9/1959:7).
In 1970, Fort Worth and Dallas were joined into one Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area
(SMSA), and in 1972 the term “Metroplex” was copyrighted as the region’s name (Cashion
2006:130). A network of interstates and tollways now connects the two cities and provides
access to the many smaller cities that make up the Metroplex. The IH 35W/IH 30 interchange
was improved in the early 1990s, a change that had been deemed necessary since the 1960s.
Highway construction necessitated compromising original platting and the historic fabric of the
affected neighborhoods (U.S. Department of Transportation 1989:3.22), thus the remaining
historic structures have become focal points around which recent redevelopment efforts have
been structured (Fort Worth, Texas, Neighborhood Advisory Council 1983). Presently located
near the improved IH 30/IH 35 interchange, Tower 55 remains at the nucleus of both rail and
vehicular traffic in Fort Worth.

CHAPTER 4
SURVEY GOALS AND METHODS

The cultural resources survey documented in this report was designed to identify and inventory
archaeological sites in addition to other important cultural resources contained within the Tower
55 Reliever project area. The work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
The first of these goals was accomplished through the employment of analytical strategies
consisting of the use of a detailed background review and intensive pedestrian survey. These
methods are discussed below.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to beginning fieldwork, background information concerning the project area was collected
and reviewed. The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, an online electronic site records database
supported by the Texas Historical Commission, was consulted in addition to internal review of
regionally related reports and an extensive investigation of regional library holdings. In addition,
examination of topographical maps, aerial photographs, and soil survey data was conducted.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY
As initially planned, pedestrian survey with shovel testing was to be restricted to the ROW of
both the currently owned lines and the rail spurs to be purchased and conducted by Geo-Marine
archaeologists escorted by railroad safety personnel. Shovel testing was to be judgmental
throughout the APE within ROW areas that had not been previously impacted by railroad
activities. However, all ROW areas showed evidence of significant disturbance throughout the
length of the APE corridor and shovel testing was deemed unnecessary. The actual extent of any
cultural resources beyond the limits of the existing and proposed ROW areas was not evaluated
due to land access restrictions.
31

The Project Archaeologist maintained field notes, and detailed photographs were taken,
documenting survey conditions, vegetation cover, and area covered daily, as well as initial
interpretations noted concerning locations along the APE corridor. All documents, photographs,
and other materials related to this work will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project.

32

CHAPTER 5
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS

The APE for the archaeological survey was confined to the footprint of the project, the current
and projected rail ROW areas. The construction of the BNSF and UPRR lines from the southern
terminus of the APE to just north of the West Fork crossing and the joint-use line at the northern
terminus both date to the latter quarter of the nineteenth century (Figure 4). The archaeological
survey of the project area involved pedestrian inspection along the length of the approximately
11.37-mile-long ROW, visually assessing the potential for buried archaeological material. The
entire length of the ROW revealed evidence of significant disturbance due to cumulative urban
development and railroad-related construction from the last century. These impacts were
photographed along the length of the ROW and are reviewed below. For ease of discussion, the
ROW was subdivided south to north into three parts: Page Avenue to Tower 55, Tower 55 to just
north of the West Fork Trinity crossing, and from the Trinity crossing to Old Denton Road
(Figures 5 and 6).

PAGE AVENUE TO TOWER 55
From the southern end, the project ROW begins with the twin BNSF rails located just south of the
intersection of Page Avenue and Hemphill Street (see Figure 5). This southernmost portion of the
project area is residential in nature (Figure 7) and gradually shifts to industrial (Figure 8) by the
time the ROW reaches West Allen Street. The UPRR line joins the project ROW about midway
between Page Avenue and West Allen Street, west of the Ney rail yard. The ROW south of West
Allen Street is flat with gravel beds underlying the rails. Additional impacts in this subsection
include the highway overpasses at Main and West Allen streets.
From West Allen Street north to Tower 55, both BNSF and UPRR rails are adjacent to each other
within the ROW (Figure 9). This subsection is primarily industrial in nature, with the exception
of some undeveloped residential lots west of the ROW between West Rosedale Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue. The rail lines are elevated as they cross over West Rosedale Street (Figure
10). Moving north from West Rosedale Street, the ROW includes underpasses at Hattie Street
(Figure 11) and West Vickery Boulevard (Figure 12). From Vickery Boulevard northward to
Tower 55, the ROW passes under the intersection of IH 35W and IH 30. Tower 55 is located at
the intersection of the UPRR and BNSF lines (Figure 13). Just north of the Tower 55 building,

the north–south (BNSF and UPRR) and east–west running (UPRR) rail lines cross at-grade
(Figure 14; see Figure 5). The numerous rails within the rail yard and foundations for the
concrete underpasses of the interstate highways adjacent to Tower 55 have severely impacted any
archaeological deposits that may have been present within the ROW.

TOWER 55 TO WEST FORK CROSSING
Moving north from Tower 55, the ROW splits into two routes: a small BNSF spur on the west
paralleling the main north–south UPRR route on the east (see Figure 5). The BNSF spur begins
just north of Tower 55 and extends to just south of the Sixth Street junction (see Figure 5). The
ROWs of both the spur and the main route pass through areas of extensive urban development,
skirting the eastern edge of the commercial center of downtown Ft. Worth (Figure 15).
North of the Sixth Street junction, the ROW moves through a mixed industrial/residential area,
becoming more industrial northward (Figure 16). The ROW is flat through the Tower 55 to West
Fork crossing segment and crosses under highway underpasses at the Sixth Street junction, East
Weatherford and Belknap Streets, and East Northside drive.

North of Cold Springs Road, the BNSF and UPPR lines rejoin in parallel lines as part of the
ROW. North of East Northside Drive, the ROW crosses the West Fork of the Trinity River by
way of the Three Sisters Bridges (Figures 17 and 18; see Figure 6). The currently proposed
project does not call for the alteration or disturbance of the West Fork bridges or their
approaches. Due to these factors, shovel testing was not performed within the West Fork
floodplain.

WEST FORK CROSSING TO OLD DENTON ROAD
Just north of the West Fork Trinity crossing, the UPRR and BNSF lines merge into a joint-use
line heading north before changing to a northeast heading (see Figure 6). The area just north of
the Three Sisters Bridges is characterized by mixed industry (Figure 19). As the joint-use line
begins to move northward, it is briefly paralleled by a FWWRR line immediately west of Decatur
Avenue (see Figure 6). The historic Mitchell Cemetery is located between the joint-use and
FWWRR lines south of 28th Street, just west of Decatur Avenue (Figure 20). The Mitchell
Cemetery is not to be impacted by proposed work along the project ROW.

Moving farther along the ROW as it begins to head in a northeast direction (see Figure 6), the
joint-use line passes through a primarily residential area (Figure 21). East of IH 35W, the ROW
passes through an upland area that is a mixture of undeveloped rural land and new industrial
construction. The private rail spurs to be purchased are located in this section of the project area
and were formerly used in private industry. The joint-use line from east of IH 35W to just west of
Old Denton Road is elevated and crosses two intermittent streams (see Figure 6). Prior to survey,
these upland streams were considered to have the highest potential for intact cultural material
within the entire project ROW.

Figure

21. Grade crossing at Schwartz Avenue, looking northeast

Figure 21. Grade crossing at Schwartz Avenue, looking northeast.

Upon actual inspection, the ROW adjacent to Little Fossil Creek (Figure 22) has been heavily
impacted through the construction of the original elevated earthen track platform that slopes
steeply to the natural ground surface. Additionally, the ROW adjacent to Little Fossil Creek has
also been impacted by the construction of sewer lines at the base of the elevated track platform
(Figure 23).
To the east, Big Fossil Creek also had been impacted by construction of the original elevated
platform. Additional impacts to Big Fossil Creek include construction-related refuse dumping on
the north side of the ROW and a high-pressure gas pipeline (Figure 24) to the south of the ROW.
From the Big Fossil Creek moving northeastward, the joint-use line returns to grade and
continues so until the end of the project ROW at Old Denton Road (Figure 25).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive archaeological survey of the Tower 55 Reliever corridor was designed to
investigate properties within the project APE to document previously unknown cultural resources
and collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL. This chapter presents a summary of investigations and
recommendations for the project corridor.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
Archaeological sites are evaluated according to criteria based on federal regulations for
determining the significance of cultural resources for inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the identification of the following
criteria, relevant historical themes, and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(B) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history[36
CFR § 60.4].

Usually, Criterion D is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important information
is generally recognized to as referring to scientific importance. This importance is, of course,
driven by such factors as current research perspectives and the state of available information
regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. Over time, data requirements for
49

some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though complementary data
are often needed from different temporal periods, geographic settings, or site types to fully
understand the diversity of past human activities. If data approach redundancy, the need for
corroborative information from similar sites is diminished. This suggests that information
deemed important are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge regarding a research domain. Archaeological sites
with integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In many cases, and for various reasons of preservation, site formation processes, or postdepositional disturbances, some archeological remains are generally regarded as having very little
or no research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of history or
prehistory. For instance, an artifact assemblage might be disturbed from its primary context, or
components of various temporal periods might be mixed or otherwise not interpretable. In such
cases, a site is not regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

State Archaeological Landmark
At the state level, archaeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1.
2.

The archaeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
The archaeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archaeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Tower 55 Reliever corridor is approximately 11.37 miles long, and the ROW is generally
about 100–150 feet in width. The improvements to the Tower 55 Reliever study corridor (CSJ
0902-48-693) were designed to improve the movement of all trains within and around current rail
infrastructure that converges on Tower 55 in Fort Worth. Tower 55 is located in the southwest
quadrant of the IH 30/IH 35W interchange, which includes the rail corridors of the UPRR, the
BNSF Railway Company, the FWWRR, and public rail. All of the proposed improvements
would be conducted within current and private rail (to be purchased) ROW areas.

50

The scope of work consisted of the performance of archaeological and historic-age structure
surveys focusing on those properties within the 11.37-mile-long project APE, which consisted of
only the current and proposed new right-of-way areas, which together encompass approximately
273 acres. This report covers the results of archaeological survey; the historic-age structure
survey is presented in a separate document. The ultimate goal of this project was to identify and
inventory cultural resources properties contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate
their potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark. No archaeological resources were found within the ROW areas
because of disturbances from the original construction, subsequent reworking of the rail lines in
the late nineteenth century and utility emplacements within the ROW through the years. The
areas originally considered to be of high probability for buried archaeological materials were
either not to be impacted by the current project (West Fork flood plain) or had already been
heavily impacted by previous construction activities (Big and Little Fossil creeks). No historic
resources as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8
were identified during the archeological investigation of the current project APE. In accordance
with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. However,
should future project plans call for modification to be made to the landscape outside the studied
ROW areas, intensive archaeological survey would be necessary.
