ABSTRACT
In April and May of 2008, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an
inventory survey of approximately 830 acres of Garner State Park along the Frio
River in northern Uvalde County, Texas. All investigations were sponsored by
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) minimum standards for
archeological survey of 200 acres or less under TAC Permit 4889. The survey is
part of TPWD’s broader effort to identify and assess cultural resources within
many of the parks in its state park system for management and interpretive
development planning. During the course of survey, archeologists revisited the
mapped locations of (or the immediate vicinity of) six previously recorded
archeological sites (41UV9, 33, 73, 197, 349 and 449) and recorded ten newlydocumented sites (41UV466-475).
Archeologists attempted to locate Site
41UV449; however, they found no evidence of the site within park boundaries.
Prehistoric sites (and site components) varied in composition and age from
expansive lithic scatters of Late Paleondian to Late Prehistoric utilization to
Early Archaic burned rock middens. Historic sites (and site components)
included a possible early industrial complex and remnants of the Civilian
Conservation Corps (CCC), who constructed the park from 1935 through 1941.
Sites 41UV9, 33, and 73 were listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs)
prior to the current survey.
Site 41UV197 has been expanded and is
recommended for SAL designation. Sites 41UV466, 468, 470, 471, 472, 474
and 475 are newly-recorded sites that are recommended for SAL designation.
All remaining sites (41UV467, 469, and 473) lack significant research potential,
are tucked well away from most park visitors’ access, and/or are too severely
damaged by erosion or other action to warrant SAL designation. Revisit to the
mapped location of 41UV349 indicated the site had been mis-mapped and is not
at that location; however, surveyors did record Site 41UV475 there.
Additionally, surveyors identified and mapped 28 less conspicuous CCC-built
features within the park and attempted to identify construction dates and
techniques for each feature. All of these features are recommended for listing as
SALs. As an appendix, the report includes recommendations for the specific
management and preservation of each site as well as trends for higher and lower
archeological sensitivity within the park boundaries. All survey-related artifacts,
photographs, and documents are curated at the TPWD’s archeology laboratory
in Austin, Texas. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit 4889.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The survey could not have been conducted without the assistance of a number
of very helpful members of the TPWD. First and foremost, many thanks are
extended to Diane Dismukes, TPWD’s Region 7 Cultural Resources Coordinator,
for all of her insight into the park, excitement in the investigation, and
assistance during backhoe trenching. Aina Dodge of TPWD’s Archives assisted
greatly by providing a wealth of background information including the
invaluable National Parks Service (NPS) planning correspondence archives from
the design phases of the park. While on site, Garner State Park staff were
instrumental in completing the project with the maximum ease and insight
possible. Park Superintendent Rick Meyers paved the way for a smooth survey
while Ranger Frank Roberts provided a wealth of historical and locational
information related to park facilities. Our thanks go out to all of those who
helped in this investigation, both named and unnamed.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
In April and May of 2008, Hicks & Company archeologists, under Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit 4889, conducted an intensive archeological
inventory survey of approximately 830 acres of Garner State Park in northern
Uvalde County, Texas for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD;
Plate 1). Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the Great
Depression and officially opened to the public on June 1, 1941, Garner State
Park is the top overnight camping destination in Texas and remains one of the
top revenue earners in the state parks system (Strong 1996; TPWD 2007). The
TPWD-sponsored survey at Garner is part of a larger, statewide effort to gather
inventories of cultural resources within a number of its state parks for purposes
of increasing and improving Garner’s interpretive potential for visitors while
fulfilling requirements for cultural resource management planning and guidance
in future infrastructural development. This inventory included the identification
and documentation of recorded and unrecorded prehistoric and historic
archeological sites and features through a combination of archival research,
pedestrian survey, surface inspection, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching. In
conducting the survey, archeologists attempted to assess the current extent,
composition, and condition of all cultural resources within the surveyed portions
of the park in order to determine their eligibility for listing as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs). With this data, archeologists can assist TPWD staff in
designating areas of the park that are considered high or low archeological
sensitivity for future infrastructure development and park management.
Named for then-Vice President and Uvalde County resident John Nance Garner,
Garner State Park is located along the banks of the Frio River in the Edwards
Plateau region of western central Texas. While now occupying 1,419 acres,
when it opened, the park consisted of only the southern 640-acre area shown on
Plate 1. Citing its incredible popularity, Garner was expanded to its current
size in 1977. Throughout the park area, the landscape is highly varied with
steep, rocky hills and bluffs occupying the majority of the original 640-acre
tract1, a deep, low and open floodplain following the bend of the Frio River
toward the east, and an open upland prairie throughout much of the northern
expanded park area (Figure 1.1). The project area is drained by several small
tributary creeks that flow into the Frio River. Within the park, facilities include
a variety of camping and picnic areas, cabins, park staff residences, shower and
bath houses, swimming areas, hiking and mountain biking trails2, concessions,
and an original open-air dance floor. Garner State Park is the only Texas park
that continues to hold regular dances at its CCC constructed pavilion.

1

The highest point in Uvalde County is located in this portion of the park, immediately south of the original park
entrance road.
2
Many of the hiking trails currently in use at the park were originally designed and used as equestrian trails. The
park included stables for visitors to keep their horses and allowed riding throughout much of the trail system.
According to Ranger Frank Roberts, horse-back riding was prohibited in the park beginning in the late 1950’s
(1958-1959) (Frank Roberts, personal communication).

Introduction

Though funding was not available to survey the park’s full 1,419-acre extent,
archeologists intensively investigated all 640 acres within park’s original
boundary developed by the CCC (called “Old Garner”) and two additional
components equaling 190 acres within Garner’s expanded area (called “New
Garner”) for a survey total of 830 acres). The floodplain component of this
portion of the old park is by far the most densely developed and utilized of the
park, while the steep uplands are generally unimpacted by park infrastructure.
Immediately north of the old park boundary and east of US 83 a second 127.2­
acre survey area extends northward to Farm to Market (FM) 1050. This segment
was arbitrarily drawn along upland soil settings and surveyed under the scope
of the current investigations.
The final area of investigation, comprising
approximately 63 acres, is located on the east side of the Frio River, immediately
south of FM 1050. With the exception of the northernmost extent, this portion
of the park falls completely within the floodplain of the Frio River. This area
houses the Cypress Springs Group Camping Facility and Park Staff residence.
Through the course of survey, archeologists excavated a total of 19 backhoe
trenches and 146 shovel tests while identifying and assessing 14 archeological
sites (41UV9, 33, 73, 197, 449, 466-475). Archeologists revisited the mapped
location of 41UV349 but found no elements that matched recorded site data.
However, a prehistoric and historic site at this location was recorded as
41UV475. Of these sites, five were already documented through previous
cultural resource assessments (41UV9, 33, 73, 197, and 449) and nine were
newly-recorded during the current survey (41UV466-475).
Archeologists
determined that humans have occupied the Garner State Park area from nearly
the beginning of their presence in the New World into historic times and, of
course, continue to live there today.
In addition to documenting archeological sites, Hicks & Company archeologists
were tasked with locating and briefly recording any individual features
attributed to the park’s CCC-era construction. A total of 28 CCC-related
features were mapped and assessed for current condition.
Features
documented included infrastructural elements such as sewer manholes, water
tanks, overlooks, and abandoned intricately-fenced nature trails.

REPORT LAYOUT
Hicks & Company’s archeologists are keenly aware of the varied and significant
cultural resources within the park and the opportunity this presents to TPWD in
developing and presenting interpretational materials to enhance a typical Garner
visitor’s experience during their stay at the park. To assist with this, we have
structured the results of the archeological survey in a manner that we feel can
better develop these educational materials. The Introduction provides the basic
background information for the park and this project and identifies the relevant
survey staff.
The Research Design, Field Methods and Survey Narrative
introduces the research goals of the survey, details the methods used, and
briefly describes the results of investigations throughout the survey area. The
Natural Setting chapter creates a picture of the natural landscape from its
geological formations and climate to the vegetational and animal resources
available to the region’s inhabitants. This chapter also summarizes the results
of geomorphological interpretations of backhoe trench investigations as these
provide a natural framework for site deposition and preservation processes.
Following the Natural Setting, the report includes a brief summary of the
region’s prehistoric background and the archeological sites and surveys that
have already been recorded and conducted in the park. With a cultural
background in place, the report then includes a Prehistoric Site Discussion
section that details prehistoric sites and site components documented during
the current survey. Site discussion focuses on distributional and compositional
patterns observed among sites in similar and dissimilar topographic and
resource settings. Following prehistoric cultural resource discussion, the report
includes a Historic Summary and Site Discussion chapter. This chapter ties
cultural resource findings directly to the local historical background of the park
rather than isolating them to separate sections of the document. Specific to this
chapter, researchers have focused archival and field analysis to address Julie
Strong’s (1996) specific recommendations toward creating a more conclusive
CCC construction timeline for the park (including construction dates wherever
possible) while identifying features that may need preventative maintenance and
attention.
A Conclusion section completes the main report body by
summarizing information contained therein. Finally, a Resource Management
Plan is included as an appendix. This section summarizes the sites identified
during the survey and makes interpretational and management practice
recommendations for each. To assist park planners with future development,
identified Zones of High and Low Archeological Sensitivity are defined and
mapped in this section as well. Throughout this volume, reference is made to
the park’s various named trails.
The reader is encouraged to refer to
Appendix C for TPWD’s published trail map, which displays these trails’ names
and locations, along with other prominent features.

Research Design, Field Methods, and Survey Narrative

2.0 RESEARCH DESIGN, FIELD METHODS, AND
SURVEY NARRATIVE
By: Bradford Jones
The 2008 archeological survey of Garner State Park consisted of a pedestrian
survey of 830 acres, or 58% of the total park area of 1,419 acres (Plates 1-3).
Initially, the survey area was limited to a complete investigation of the original
640 acres of Garner State Park. Following the award of the contract, an
additional 190 acres were added to the proposed survey area. The expansion
included a 127-acre tract referred to as the Northwest Survey Extension situated
along the northwest edge of the park where it abuts US 83. This segment begins
at the northern boundary of the original park and continues north to FM 1050.
The second area added to the project is the “Northeastern Survey Extension”, a
63-acre tract located east of the river in the northeast corner of the park
property. This chapter lays out the research goals and field methodology
employed during the survey as well as a brief overview of the fieldwork’s results
with a focus on issues of methodology as applied in field contexts.

2.1

RESEARCH GOALS AND GENERAL FIELD STRATEGY
The primary goals of the archeological survey were to: (1) identify and document
the current condition of any previously recorded and/or new prehistoric/historic
period sites that exist within the project area, (2) document CCC period features
at the park, (3) provide recommendations on the eligibility of all recorded sites
for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL), and (4) develop a
comprehensive cultural resources management plan for these sites in order to
facilitate future park development and cultural resource management.
In order to achieve these goals, background research was conducted to establish
high and low probability areas for cultural resources within the park and to
develop an appropriate research design for the survey. This background
research included analysis of all pertinent topographic maps and geologic source
materials, review of all previously recorded archeological sites within the park,
and a detailed review of the archival documentation pertaining to the history of
the park and to the process of park construction by the CCC.
Soil surveys and geologic maps were utilized to identify areas where there was a
higher probability of encountering buried site deposits or that appeared too
steep or too disturbed by natural processes such as erosion and flooding to
contain significant archeological deposits. Topographic and historic maps were
consulted to establish high probability areas for historic structures or other
landscape features. Records of previously recorded sites were collected and
checked to ensure that these sites were re-visited and not accidentally re­
recorded as new sites, as well as to develop a general model of archeological
sites types and location within the survey area. Finally, the detailed archival
records kept by TPWD were studied to both identify locations of CCC
construction and to develop a comprehensive understanding of the types of
features and construction techniques employed by the CCC in order to
accurately identify and record them in the field.
Based on this data, archeologists overlaid a 30-meter-interval grid on the project
area and divided the portions of the survey into three general landform types for

which particular methods of survey were proposed: (1) Uplands – the ridge tops
and steep sides of the hills within the park, (2) Intermediate – the gently sloping
transitional area between the terraces of the lowlands and the steep ridge
slopes, and (3) Lowland/Terrace Sites – the relatively flat terraces and river
banks above the Frio River. In an effort to locate all cultural resources within the
park boundary, each traversable block was scheduled for 100% surface
inspection through pedestrian survey. Surface inspection was conducted by
crew members walking parallel 30-meter transects in all portions of the project
area considered to have a high probability for encountering archeological
remains. All portions of the blocks that did not lie within high probability areas
found in steeply-sloping contexts (>20% grade), or which bore clear evidence of
extensive disturbance, were surface inspected only, with no shovel testing
implemented. Steeper landforms were thoroughly investigated through surface
inspection for potential rockshelters. All steep limestone faces and overhangs
were visited on foot and examined for potential evidence of prehistoric or historic
activity. Throughout the project area, locations where park plans and archival
data suggested the presence of CCC related features or occupations were given
special attention, including shovel testing and backhoe trenching (where
necessary). The remainder of this section describes in detail the basic field
methodologies and techniques employed during the course of the survey. This is
followed by a section describing the overall results of the survey of each of the
different areas within the park with particular attention paid to matters of
method and how it varied in accordance with conditions on the ground.
Subsurface testing, including both shovel testing and backhoe trenching, was
conducted in those areas with low surface visibility (<30%) and areas with a high
probability of buried deposits, or at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.
High probability areas for significant buried cultural resources were shovel
tested at a rate exceeding the Council of Texas Archeologists’/Texas Historical
Commission’s (CTA/THC) standards for large-scale areal surveys of 200 acres or
less (1 test per 3 acres). Shovel testing rates declined within high probability
areas where conditions were favorable for thorough site identification through
surface inspection only. Shovel tests were typically terminated at shallow
bedrock throughout much of the project area, but were excavated to a depth of
one meter or to culturally sterile soils where appropriate. Soil from all shovel
tests was screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Investigators recorded their
observations and the results of shovel tests through notes, standardized shovel
test forms, and photographs. All shovel tests were identified and mapped using
hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) units.
Hicks & Company conducted backhoe trenching within the lowland portions of
the park where there was a potential for deeply buried deposits. TPWD’s
intention was to utilize backhoe trenching to develop a general geomorphological
model of the park’s deep soil deposits as well as identify deeply buried cultural
resources and sites. This model will provide TPWD a broad picture of higher
versus lower probability geomorphological settings for cultural resources,
allowing them to use that data to guide possible future park development
planning. Approximately 90 acres of the project area were backhoe trenched (or
roughly one backhoe trench per every five acres within deep soil contexts)
(Plates 2-3). While there were additional portions of the park where backhoe
trenching could have been utilized, these areas are currently occupied by camp
sites, cabins, or other park facilities (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941, TPWD 2008).
These park facility areas have been improved with roads, trails, and buried
sewer, water, and electric utilities. These improvements have not only minimally
disturbed the subsurface deposits, but also make avoidance of utilities difficult.

Research Design, Field Methods, and Survey Narrative

As a result, Hicks & Company only conducted backhoe trenching in the least
disturbed portions of these lowlands. During the 2008 survey, contractors were
under way conducting extensive additions and improvements to the buried
water system within the southern portion of the park, creating a large network
of open and filled utility trenches, staging areas, and push piles, further
reducing viable trenching sites within the southern, developed portions of the
park (Figure 2.1). As per TPWD request, Diane Dismukes was present during a
portion of the excavation to assist with trench placement and avoidance of
existing utilities.

Figure 2.1: Typical disturbance from water line upgrades during survey (in this instance
along Madrone Trail).
Particular attention was also paid to the portion of the park adjacent to Site
41UV449, which was recommended in 2005 for trenching to fully investigate
potentially deep cultural resources, south of the original TxDOT survey
boundary.
Trenches were excavated to the maximum depth of Holocene deposition, the
maximum reach of the backhoe (whichever is reached first), or until otherwise
obstructed.
All trench excavations were completed in accordance with
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for trench
safety. Sediment from occasional bucket sweeps (approximately one bucket for
every 20-25 centimeters of depth) was screened through one-fourth-inch
hardware cloth. Trenches were recorded on standardized trench forms, along
with profile drawings, photographs, GPS, and any additional documentation
deemed necessary.
The survey investigations followed a modified no-collection policy. Diagnostic
artifacts found on the ground surface and all materials encountered within
shovel tests and trenches were collected for analysis and curation. Artifacts that
were returned to their find location were documented to a level appropriate of

their significance through notes and/or photographs before discard.
All
collected artifacts will be delivered to TPWD for formal curation in partial
completion of the TAC permit.
Archeological site definitions complied with THC/CTA survey standards and
policy including additional requirements for assessing historic sites and
cemeteries (see below). Sites identified within the survey area were both
intensively studied for their surface and subsurface distribution in a manner
appropriate to fully assess their size, depth, composition, condition, and basic
significance. Site boundaries were defined to within five meters and, along with
shovel tests, were mapped using sub-meter GPS technology. Specific site
information was recorded on standardized forms and submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for inclusion in their archives. Site
trinomials have been produced for all newly recorded archeological sites and
revisit forms filed for previously recorded sites.
Archeological sites
demonstrating sufficient integrity, significant artifact recovery, the potential for
the site to make a contribution to data gaps in the region’s archeological record,
or were in imminent danger of being negatively impacted by current use were
recommended for preservation in place or SAL-eligibility testing if preservation is
not a viable option (Mercado-Alinger et al. 1996). Previously recorded sites found
within the survey area were revisited and evaluated for their current
composition, condition and potential for SAL eligibility.
Prehistoric sites were evaluated with respect to overall integrity, context, and the
uniqueness of the data provided. Historic archeological sites were evaluated
based on their integrity, context, historical association, and data potential. Sites
associated with certain significant themes, such as CCC activities (TPWD 2008),
early roads, or post-1850s settlement sites (Ochoa 2008) were considered
important.
Original park records and drawings show locations for a variety of
features within the park that were revisited including the CCC’s Camp Garner
(NPS and TSPB 1935-1941). TPWD supplied Hicks & Company with a GPS-tied
data dictionary related to typical CCC features, which archeologists utilized to
record the findings in greater detail for integration with TPWD’s Geographic
Information System (GIS).
As per the THC’s policy on late-19th and early-20th-century sites, any historical
sites identified during the survey were documented not only through field
efforts, but also through survey level archival research. This research included
deed record and historic map research in order to assess the SAL eligibility of
the deposits. Particular attention was paid to archival resources related to the
park’s CCC construction history and all identified features that were found
related to this key period in the park’s history (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941).

2.2

ON-SITE FIELD METHODS
As mentioned in the previous section, once surveyors arrived on site, it was clear
that the ruggedness and extreme variability of the landscape within the survey
area required some adjustment to the proposed field methodology to best suit
conditions on the ground while achieving the desired goals in a thorough and
timely manner. The remainder of this chapter provides a brief overview of the
actual fieldwork conducted within each of the zones.

2.2.1

Upland Areas
Given the steep slopes of the upland ridges and peaks, the prevalence of exposed
bedrock and shallow soils on the top of the upland ridges, and low intensity of
CCC development in this portion of the project area, these areas were targeted
for pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing in all accessible areas and
careful inspection of locations where possible rock shelters could exist. A crew
of two archeologists surveyed the upland areas, walking in parallel transects 30
meters apart. All upland ridge tops were fully surveyed to the edge of the ridge;
to the point at which it began to drop off precipitously (Figure 2.2). In most of
the upland areas the width of the ridge top was able to be surveyed in two to
four transects. As expected, there was little to no soil on the upland ridges, and
surface visibility was typically greater than 70 percent and often 95 to 100
percent. Several areas consisted of fully exposed limestone bedrock (Figure
2.3). A total of nine shovel tests were dug in the upland areas. These shovel
tests were all placed in areas where scatters of lithic debitage and small
numbers of tools were identified on the surface. None of the shovel tests
indicated the potential for subsurface archeological deposits in association with
the surficial scatters.

Research Design, Field Methods, and Survey Narrative

Figure 2.3: View of upland area ridge top with expanse of exposed limestone bedrock.
The side slopes of the uplands were minimally surveyed owing to their extremely
steep grade, the very unlikely prospect of encountering intact archeological sites
in these types of topographic settings, and the sheer difficulty of traversing these
areas on foot. Footing was particularly treacherous owing to the often unstable
scree that developed from repeated erosion and redeposition (Figure 2.4). Even
if prehistoric sites were perched at one time on these side slopes, they invariably
would have been swept downhill through extensive erosion and been lost. Side
slopes were found to be very steep but generally convex with minimal potential
for rock overhangs (which would be good candidates for rockshelter sites).
Whenever rock faces or overhangs were encountered with the potential to
contain caves or sites suitable for human habitation, the side slope was
intensively investigated through surface inspection and direct investigation of
any caves encountered. Field crews traversed the slope parallel to the outcrops,
carefully inspecting locations where there appeared any possibility of caves,
overhangs, or rock shelters. Four such caves and overhangs were identified and
investigated during the survey in the side slope areas, however, none contained
any evidence of prehistoric cultural activity (historic significance of some is
covered in the Historic Site Discussion; Figure 2.5).
All upland drainage channels (and channel terraces) were investigated for
cultural resources through pedestrian survey and occasional shovel testing. The
southwestern upland channel was targeted due to its generally high potential for
occupational sites such as burned rock middens while the eastern and northern
upland channels were listed on CCC records as check dam locations. The
northern channel was also targeted due to its indication on 1912 and 1927
USGS Topographic maps and CCC Planning documents as an ‘Indian Trail
(USGS 1912, 1927; NPS and TSPB 1935-1941; Figure 2.6).’ These channels
were often very steep and difficult to traverse and filled with large boulders,
gravels, fallen trees, and flood deposits. Surveyors found all of these channels to
be scoured of soils and generally appeared to be extremely high energy erosional

settings with minimal potential for preserving archeological sites. No prehistoric
cultural resources were encountered within the ‘Indian Trail.’ As described in
the discussion of the historic components of the survey, the clearly high energy
forces associated with the seasonal drainages has destroyed most archeological
sites located within them or in their immediate environments.
The results of the upland survey identified a large low density prehistoric
occupation on much of the ridge top where chert was found to outcrop from the
limestone bedrock; the location was designated Site 41UV466. The chert
outcrops were surrounded by concentrations of decortication flakes, tested
cobbles, cores, core fragments, and occasional tools. As noted above, no
subsurface deposits were identified, even though shovel tests were repeatedly
placed in locations where artifact concentrations were at their highest. This site
also has a historic stone fence component. While survey of the limestone cliff
faces and overhangs did relocate a previously recorded cave site, no new caves
or occupations were identified. The steep slopes of the ridges were only
minimally surveyed, but surveyors did occasionally encounter random flakes or
possible fire cracked rock indicating that erosional forces were likely
redepositing limited amounts of prehistoric material from the ridge top sites onto
these steep slopes. Similarly, erosion is believed to be responsible for a lack of
CCC period erosional control features described in the archival record. Very few
were actually located during field investigations.
2.2.2

Intermediate Area
The Intermediate area, which consists of the gently sloping flat terraces situated
at the toe of the upland ridges and the rear of the lower river terraces, often
along seasonal drainages, were surveyed by two person crews walking transects
with 30-meter intervals (Figure 2.7). The landscape was often covered in cedar

woods with grasses and cactus as understory. The surface conditions ranged
between areas of colluvial and alluvial soils with no surface bedrock to areas
with outcropping bedrock.
In the northwestern survey extension, the
intermediate areas were found to be rolling with sparse grasses and yucca and
steep, gravelly side slopes (Figure 2.8 and 2.9). Surface visibility consequently
fluctuated widely. Shovel testing was used in areas with less than 30% surface
visibility with the potential for buried deposits, and in site contexts. A total of
40 shovel tests were dug in this portion of the project area. Shovel testing was
found to be of limited utility in these areas due to shallow deposits, exposed
bedrock, and erosion. In general, sites in this portion of the project area tended
to be characterized by surficial deposits that have been negatively affected by
ongoing erosional forces associated with colluvial action on the slopes and
fluvial action adjacent to the drainages. A total of seven sites – 41UV33,
41UV467, 41UV469, 41UV470, 41UV472, 41UV473, and 41UV475 – including
both historic and prehistoric components were revisited (41UV33) or newly
recorded during the survey of the Intermediate Area.

2.2.3

Lowland/Terrace Areas
Finally, the lowland area, where there is the greatest potential for deeply buried
sites, was surveyed by field crews of two to four people walking 30 meter wide
transects and supplemented with shovel testing and backhoe trenching. A total
of 19 backhoe trenches and 97 shovel tests were dug in this portion of the
project area.
Surface visibility varied widely depending on the use and
prevailing vegetation. For example, along the lower terraces adjacent to the Frio
River, scouring and flood deposits had completely destroyed the potential for any
archeological sites to be encountered or found to be intact (Figure 2.10). This
was particularly true along the river in the northeast sector of the park and
along the river’s oxbow farther south where exposed channel deposits of gravels
were extensive (Figure 2.11). Secondary terraces above the river were found to
be large expanses of soils with the potential for buried deposits. The presence of
the soil also correlated with denser vegetation including sodded carpet grass in
many of the park areas that resulted in overall lower surface visibility (Figures
2.12 and 2.13). As a result, shovel testing was more important in this area to
determine the presence of archeological deposits than elsewhere, though many
sites found in this region – particularly historic trash scatters - continued to be
highly surficial in nature. The exceptions were the sites and deposits located by
backhoe trenching.

indications of prehistoric activity, likely having been extensively scoured by flood
waters (Figure 2.14).

With survey in the original park boundary in particular, the lowland and terrace
region was by far the most intensively utilized and disturbed. Virtually every
portion of the original park area in the lowland setting has been disturbed by
construction including park roads and shelters, a putt-putt golf course, a water
treatment facility, or camping sites and RV pads. As mentioned, disturbance
beneath the surface continued with a maze of historic and new buried water,
sewer, electrical and telephone lines further reduced site preservation potential
(Figures 2.15-2.18). The eastern-most quarter of the northeastern survey
extension was also disturbed by a buried telephone line (Figure 2.19; see
Previous Investigations).
A total of seven sites – 41UV9, 41UV73, 41UV197, 41UV449, 41UV468,
41UV471, and 41UV474 – were recorded or revisited (41UV9, 41UV73,
41UV197, and 41UV449) in the lowland area, representing a range of prehistoric
and historic site types. It should be noted that Site 41UV73 is technically
outside of the project area, but was found to extend from the original site area
that was mapped into campsites that were occupied by Hicks & Company
archeologists during the project. At the request of TPWD archeologist Diane
Dismukes, Hicks & Company archeologists re-recorded this site to include the
expanded site area encountered.

In summary, the field methodology employed during the 2008 survey of Garner
State Park generally adhered to the guidelines for archeological survey of
projects less than 200 acres in size established by the THC. At times, survey
methodology exceeded these recommendations where the possibility of
archeological sites was considered very probable. Such areas included the
original location of the CCC Camp Garner and in the vicinity of previously
recorded sites.

3.0 NATURAL SETTING
By: John A. Campbell

3.1

GENERAL SETTING
Garner State Park is situated in the northeastern part of Uvalde County on the
southern edge of the Edwards Plateau along the Balcones Escarpment. The
edge of the Edwards Plateau has been dissected by stream erosion producing
high, level uplands with steep slopes and is commonly referred to as the Hill
Country (Abbot 1986). The region is characterized by limestone mesas and
plateaus, which are divided by narrow streams in steep canyons. Soils within
the region are generally thin and calcareous, supporting predominantly oakjuniper savannah vegetation (EAA 2004). Overall the region supports a wide
variety of flora, fauna, water, and mineral resources that have been utilized
throughout history.

3.2

CLIMATE
The park is located within the Subtropical Subhumid climate region of Texas.
This region extends from north to south across the central portion of the state
and is characterized by hot summers and dry winters (Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The average annual precipitation within the region is about 27 inches, which
falls mostly as rain in the early summer and fall. Precipitation is highest in the
months of May and June (3.0 to 3.5 inches) and also in the month of September
(3.5 inches) (Larkin and Bomar 1983; Carr 1967; Anaya 2004). During these
rainy months, southerly, moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Mexico generally
clash with cooler, dryer air from the north, causing a release of moisture over
the Edwards Plateau during these months (Slade 1986). In addition, the warm,
moist, Gulf air rises along the Balcones Escarpment and cools, causing
precipitation and often heavy storms along the edge of the plateau (Slade 1986;
Carr 1967). During the winter months between November and February,
precipitation drops to around 0.75 to 1.5 inches as colder, dryer air moves in
from the plains.
Temperatures in the northeastern portion of Uvalde County typically reach into
the upper 90s during the summer months with low temperatures dropping into
the 30s during the winter. The average annual temperature of the region is 67
degrees. January is typically the coldest month with average low and high
temperatures of 36 and 62 degrees, while July is generally the hottest month
with average low and high temperatures of 70 and 96 degrees (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). Weather data collected by Carr (1967) and Larkin and Bomar
(1983) between 1931 and 1980 shows a slight decrease in the average annual
high temperature (-2.1 degrees) and an increase in the average low temperature
(+5.2 degrees).

3.3

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The geomorphology of the park is simply an expression of the underlying geology
and the weathering processes that affect landform and soil formation. The
weathering of limestone hills in the park by rain and wind has created thin soils
in high upland areas and deep, carbonitic soils in the lowlands (Abbott 1986).
The uplands are characterized by rocky landscapes with exposed limestone faces

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

21

Natural Settings

and steep slopes. These high uplands overlook slopes and low uplands with
rocky soils that descend into the deep alluvial soils of the Frio River.
3.3.1

Geology
The Balcones Escarpment, upon which Garner sits, represents the remains of
the Ouachita Mountains that formed during a tectonic event at the end of the
Paleozoic Era (EAA 2004; Anaya 2004). The Ouachita Mountains extended from
Mexico to Arkansas and allowed for the formation of shallow seas to the
northwest. During the Early Cretaceous Period shallow seas advanced across
this area, depositing sediments that formed the Glen Rose Formation and began
formation of the Stuart City Reef Trend and the more local Devils River Reef
Trend which makes up the Devils River Limestone (part of the Edwards
Limestone group) (Anaya 2004). In the Cenozoic Era, faulting along the buried
Ouachita Mountain range caused regional uplift forming the Balcones Fault
Zone, displacing Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary sediments (EAA 2004; Anaya
2004; Vaughan 1900). The current landscape has been formed by the continual
down cutting of streams and rivers through the Balcones Escarpment as these
waterways make their way to the Gulf of Mexico.
There are three primary geologic groups within the park boundaries, the Glen
Rose Formation, Devils River Limestone, and Quaternary deposits (BEG 1983).
The Glen Rose Formation and the Devils River Formation both formed during
the Cretaceous period beneath inland seas. The Glen Rose Formation consists
of limestone, dolomite, and marls formed during the Lower Cretaceous. Soft
marls alternate with the dolomites and limestones of the Glen Rose formation
creating a stepped landscape and are prone to landslides (BEG 1983; Mear
1995). The Devils River Limestone is part of the Edwards Limestone group and
consists of hard limestone and dolomite that sits atop the Glen Rose Formation.
Chert also occurs within the Devils River Limestone, which caps the high
uplands in the park. The Quaternary deposits are sediments in the lowlands
consisting of limestone, dolomite, and chert cobbles eroded out of the
surrounding limestone (BEG 1983).
Another geological formation worth mentioning is a series of Cretaceous igneous
rocks that occur south of the Balcones Escarpment. These formations do not
occur within the park, but their mention is noteworthy due to the recovery of a
basalt flake on Site 41UV197. These igneous rock formations contain alkalic
basalt and nontronite pyroclasts that are occurring in dikes, sills, volcanic
necks, or laccoliths. These igneous rocks are intrusive and are younger than the
surrounding limestone, having cut through these formations or floated them on
their surface. The subsequent erosion has left some hillsides south of the park
with exposed basalt faces as well as the presence of basalt sediments in the
surrounding gravels (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983; Vaughan 1900). There
are outcrops located approximately 21 and 23 kilometers from the park.

3.3.2

Soils
The soils within the park are mapped within the Rock land-Real-Eckrant
association and the Ector-Eckrant-Speck association. The Rock land-RealEckrant association consists of exposed limestone bedrock and nearly level to
gently sloping and undulating to steep, shallow to very shallow and gravelly,
loamy and clayey soils (Stevens and Richmond 1976). This association is
located primarily within the high uplands in the southern and western portions

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

22

Natural Settings

of the park. The lowland areas around the Frio River are within the Ector­
Eckrant-Speck association, characterized by nearly level to gently sloping and
undulating to hilly, very shallow to shallow and stony, clayey and loamy soils
(Stevens and Richmond 1976). These soils associations are further divided into
eleven different soil series. These soils are characteristic of the landscapes they
occupy which are divided into four geomorphic groups: high uplands, slopes and
low uplands, high alluvial terraces, and low alluvial terraces.
High Uplands
The high uplands geomorphic group is defined primarily as the areas in the
southern portion of the park, which contain the high, dissected limestone hills.
These upland areas have very thin soils and are dominated primarily by the
Rock land-Real association (RRE) of soils. These soils are mostly exposed,
indurated limestone with portions of the clayey loam Real soils occurring in
crevices and along slopes. Slopes in this group are steep and erosion is severe.
Vegetation in this group is also sparse with denser, woody vegetation occurring
on the northern slopes and less dense vegetation and grasses growing on the
southern slopes. The soils in this group are mollisols formed primarily in situ
from the weathered limestone of the Glen Rose Formation (Stevens and
Richmond 1976).
Slopes and Low Uplands
This geomorphic group is defined as the low slopes along the margins of the
uplands as they descend into the floodplain. These areas include the base of the
high uplands, the western portion of the park, and the far northeast corner of
the park. There are four soil series mapped within these areas: Brackett and
Real soils, Real and Eckrant soils, Pratley clay, and Speck soils. The Brackett
and Real soils (BRB) are gravelly loams along upland slopes that are only about
10 to 20 centimeters in thickness overlying soft limestone. These soils often
occur on benched landscapes. Real and Eckrant soils (REB) also occur on
upland slopes and consist of hard, friable clay loams to a depth of 25
centimeters, overlying soft limestone.
Limestone fragments are common
throughout this soil. The Pratley clay (PrB) is an upland soil on the lower slopes
of the uplands consisting of dark, blocky, calcareous clay. A petrocalcic zone is
indicative of this soil, usually occurring around one meter below the surface.
This petrocalcic zone is a zone of indurated caliche and limestone. Low upland
areas in the park typically consist of Speck soils (SpB). These soils are dark,
blocky, calcareous clays with limestone and chert fragments throughout, which
extend to a depth of about 35 centimeters overlying limestone. The soils in this
group are mollisols that formed in situ and in colluvium from weathered
limestone in the Glen Rose and Edwards Limestone Formations (Stevens and
Richmond 1976).
High Alluvial Terraces
The high alluvial terraces are located within the northern portions of the park.
This geomorphic group consists of the higher, older, and more developed alluvial
terraces. The soils in this group are inceptisols and vertisols that formed in
alluvium deposited during the upper and middle Pleistocene. There are three
soil series mapped within this group: Montell clay, Sabenyo clay, and Atco loam.
The Montell clay (MoA) is a vertic soil that formed in outwash deposits from
adjacent uplands in the northwest portion of the park. These soils consist of
deep, calcareous, blocky clays that occur between the uplands and the active

Natural Settings

floodplain. The Sabenyo clay (SaC) only occurs in the northeast portion of the
park along an intermittent tributary of the Frio River. These soils are highly
calcareous, deep clay loams overlying sandy loams. The Atco loam is the largest
soil series represented on the high alluvial terraces. These soils are deep,
calcareous loams and sandy clay loams on nearly level terraces (Stevens and
Richmond 1976).
Low Alluvial Terraces
The lower alluvial terraces in the southern and central portions of the park
comprise three mapped soil series: Bosque loam, Frio silty clay loam, and Orif
soils. The Bosque loam (Bo) occurs only in the southern portion of the park
below the high uplands and is flooded every five to ten years. This soil consists
of loams to fine sandy loams that are deep and calcareous. Rounded limestone
pebbles are common throughout all zones. The Frio silty clay loam (FoA, FoB,
Fs) occurs in the central and northeastern portions of the park and floods every
five to twenty years. These soils consist of deep, calcareous silty clay loams and
clay loams on nearly level terraces. The Orif soils (Or) occupy the broad point
bars of the Frio River in the southern and central portions of the park. These
soils consist of calcareous fine sandy loams, gravelly sand, and sand. Rounded
limestone pebbles and cobbles are common throughout. Along the edges of the
Frio River these areas of Orif soils are heavily eroded terraces of exposed gravels
and cobbles with sparse vegetation (Figure 2.18). The soils in this group are
mollisols and entisols that formed within recent alluvium (Stevens and
Richmond 1976).
3.3.3

Trench Discussion
A total of 19 trenches were excavated within the park boundaries during the
current survey (Plates 2 and 3). These trenches were located within the
floodplain of the Frio River in the south, central, and the northeastern portions
of the park. Trenches were excavated with the intent of assessing the park’s
geomorphology and soils while attempting to identify sites. All trenches were
excavated to approximately 300 centimeters below ground surface or to bedrock.
The back dirt from each trench was screened at a rate of approximately one
bucket for every 20 to 25 centimeters of depth. The length of the trenches
varied, but they were generally 375 centimeters in length with a width of 80
centimeters. The trenches are discussed below and are grouped according to
their location in the park.

Park Floodplain South
This area encompasses the portion of the Frio River floodplain at the southern
end of the park between the concession stand and the edge of the uplands. A
total of four trenches were excavated. This area is characterized by a low
floodplain that rises gradually to the northeast onto an alluvial gravel terrace.
The gravel terrace is completely exposed near the river where vegetation is
sparse, but is overlain with a thin organic layer in and around the cabin area.
The soils mapped in this area are Bosque loam (Bo) in the lower floodplain and
Orif soils (Or) on the higher terrace.
Trenches 1, 2, and 3 were excavated in the lower floodplain and all had similar
profiles. The excavation of Trench 3 was halted at around 120 centimeters
below ground surface when a CCC-era terra cotta sewer drain pipe was

encountered. Trenches 1 and 2 both contained silty loams overlying very fine
silty sands (Tables 3.1 and 3.2; Figure 3.1). The boundaries between each
zone are poorly defined and the soils seem poorly developed, as is typically the
case with younger alluvial deposits. Trench 1 bottomed out at bedrock, which
consists of large boulder colluvial sediments from the adjacent upland, at a
depth of 153 centimeters below ground surface.

Trench 4 was excavated on the higher alluvial terrace north of the lower
floodplain. This area is occupied by cabins and sparsely scattered old growth
hardwoods. This higher terrace is an extensive gravel bed with dense gravels
and cobbles that are exposed along the river. The soils observed in the trench
are generally silty loams with dense cobbles and gravels to a depth of 154
centimeters below ground surface. Underlying these gravels are very silty loams
that have few or no gravels to a depth of 315 centimeters below ground surface
(Table 3.3; Figure 3.2).

This area is located north of the high uplands and west of the Frio River; the
study area is bound on the north by the original park boundary. Three trenches
were excavated in this area within the mapped Atco loam (AtA). However, all of
these trenches have very different profiles. Trench 5 was located at the eastern
end of this section on a high terrace overlooking the Frio River to the east. The
soils in this trench were primarily silty loams that increased in clay content with
depth. All three zones were calcareous with an increase in gravels and cobbles
near the base of the trench, at bedrock (Table 3.4; Figure 3.3). Limestone
bedrock was encountered at a depth of 199 centimeters below ground surface.
This trench was positive for a single piece of chert shatter at 40 centimeters

Trench 6 also contains silty loams, but bottoms out at bedrock at a very shallow
depth, 55 centimeters below ground surface (Table 3.5). The top two zones of
this trench contained numerous gravels and bedrock fragments. The bedrock
observed in this trench appeared to be dolomite. Three features associated with
the CCC camp were identified in this trench and it is likely that the upper 55
centimeters of sediment was disturbed during that time. Trench 7 was primarily
silty sand overlying coarse channel deposits. The sand became increasingly
coarse with depth in this trench coupled with an increase in gravel density
(Table 3.6; Figure 3.4). Lithic debitage was recovered from this trench between
60 and 110 centimeters below ground surface.

Both Trench 5 and Trench 6 encountered bedrock at a very shallow depth.
There is also a caliche pit with shallow limestone just north of Trench 5 that was
used by the CCC during park construction. This occurrence of shallow bedrock
on the floodplain is likely a higher limestone formation that drops off to the
south and west as evidenced by Trench 7.
Park Floodplain Northeast
The far northeast corner of the park is bound by FM 1050 to the north, CR 350
to the east and the Frio River to the south. The study area is a level floodplain,
divided by an intermittent tributary of the Frio River, which rises gradually to
the east into the uplands. A total of twelve trenches were excavated within this
area; ten west of the tributary and two east of the tributary. Soils in this area
are mapped as Atco loam (AtA), Sabenyo clay loam (SaC), Frio silty clay loam
(FoA and FoB), and Real and Eckrant soils (REB). Trenches 8 through 17 were
excavated west of the intermittent tributary and all exhibited similar profiles.
The soils observed in these trenches generally consisted of silt and silty loams
overlying denser gravel deposits. Below these gravel deposits the zones generally
alternate in an upward fining sequence of gravels, sands, silts, and clays (Tables

3.7 through 3.16; Figure 3.5). The clay content in the trenches increases with
depth. All trenches exhibited a possible plow zone, but it is unknown if the area
was plowed historically. Trench 15 was the most northern trench in the area
and contained few gravels and no distinct gravelly horizon. This trench also
exhibited a possible buried soil horizon between 98 and 217 centimeters below
ground surface. Trench 17 was the only trench to encounter bedrock, at a
depth of 300 centimeters below ground surface. Trenches 14 and 15 were
excavated within the recorded site boundaries of Site 41UV449, but were
negative for cultural material. The remaining trenches were used to delineate
the site boundaries of 41UV468.

Trenches 18 and 19 were excavated east of the intermittent tributary. This area
is fairly level but is located at the base of the uplands and rises gradually to the
east. The soils in these trenches were silty clay loam with dense gravels and
cobbles with an increase in sand with depth (Tables 3.17 and 3.18). The soils
in this area are mapped as Frio silty clay loams, but appear to be a mix of the
Frio soils and the Real and Eckrant soils indicating a possible overprinting of
colluvial sediments on top of alluvial sediments.

3.4

PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC FLORA AND FAUNA
The variable landscape of Garner State Park has supported a wide variety of
flora and fauna throughout history. The park is located within the Balconian
biotic province as defined by Blair (1950). The first Spanish explorers to reach
the region reported stands of grama grass (Bouteloua sp.), live oak, (Quercus
virginiana) elm (Ulmus sp.), cottonwood (Populus sp.), hackberry (Celtis sp.),
mulberry (Morus sp.), and grapevines (Vitis sp. ) (Mecke 1996; Foster 1995).
Also, prior to settlement of the region big bluestem, sideoats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis), Texas wintergrass (Stipa
leucotricha), and buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) would have dominated the
uplands. Trees and shrubs in the uplands included live oak, burr oak (Quercus
macrocarpa),
shin
oak
(Quercus
pungens),
hackberry,

junipers (Juniperus sp.), catclaw (Acacia greggii), yucca (Yucca sp.), cacti of
various species, mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), and sumacs (Rhus sp.).
Lowland areas contained pecan (Carya illionensis), ash (Fraxinus sp.), bald
cypress (Taxodium distichum), walnut (Juglans sp.), mulberry, maple (Acer sp.),
willow (Salix sp.), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and cottonwood (Populus sp.)
(Mecke 1996; Landers 1987; TPWD 1976).
Although much of the same
vegetation occurs today within the park, overgrazing, range fencing, and control
of wildfire has greatly reduced the number of mid and tall grasses in the region
and allowed shrubs and trees to invade the upland areas. The most obvious
tree to replace the tall grasses on the uplands is the Ashe juniper, a common
species at the park. The lack of mid and tall grasses has resulted in increased
runoff and erosion and it has been estimated that many tons per acre of top soil
have been lost between 1930 and 1995 (Mecke 1996). This has likely had a
severe impact on the integrity of upland sites in the region.
Fauna observed during the early Spanish expeditions included white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), bison (Bison bison), pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra
americana), “wild goat”3 (unknown), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), cottontail
rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), coyote (Canis latrans), and numerous birds and fish
(Foster 1995). The bison, pronghorn antelope, and wild goat are no longer
present within the region due to over hunting and changing environmental
conditions. Although there is very little mention of wild goats by early explorers,
the bison and the pronghorn antelope persisted in the region into the late 19th
century (Foster 1995). Currently, the fauna within the park is very similar to
that of the past with white-tailed deer, gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), javelina
(Pecari tajacu), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), bats of various species, raccoon
(Procyon lotor), fox and rock squirrels (Scirius niger, Spermophilus variegatus),
cottontail, and numerous birds. Birds in the park include the mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura), bob white (Colinus virginianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes
aura), black vulture (Coragyps atratus), and the wild turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo) (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1976). The armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus) is a common sight in the park and first appeared in Texas in the
1850s (Foster 1995). The park also has over 49 species of frogs, salamanders,
snakes, turtles and lizards (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1976).

3.5

PREHISTORIC CLIMATE CHANGES
The region’s climate has varied over the course of human occupation. During
the Wisconsin Glacial Period much of the region was dominated by grasslands
and scrubby vegetation with some intrusion by conifer and deciduous forests
between 22,500 and 14,000 BP. This time period was cool and humid and
predates human occupation in the region (Bryant and Shafer 1977). Over the
next 4,000 years the climate shifted to a warmer, drier climate causing the
deciduous and conifer forest to retreat leaving large areas of scrub grasslands.
Several species of fauna begin to disappear from the fossil record as well during
this time (Antevs 1955; Bryant and Shafer 1977). From 10,000 BP to the
present Bryant and Shafer (1977) state that central Texas exhibits a significant

“Wild Goats” as they are referenced in early Spanish Chronicles are not likely actual feral goats but are probably
mis-identified undulates, possibly the Desert Bighorn (Ovis Canadensis), which is known to live in the adjacent
western mountains and may have ventured east during historic periods.

decrease in tree pollen in the fossil record coupled with a significant increase in
herb and grass pollen. Within this time period is a period that Antevs (1955)
defines as the altithermal which represents a drier less mesic period between
7,000 and 4,000 BP. Although it is debated as to the extent of droughts during
this period regarding their frequency or intensity, it is evident that the region
was progressing towards more xeric vegetation indicative of a warmer, drier
climate. Evidence of this climate shift is found in both the fossil pollen record as
well as the archeological record (McKinney 1981; Bryant and Shafer 1977;
Meltzer 1999). The current post-oak savanna vegetation common in the region
currently was likely established approximately 3,000 years ago (Bryant and
Shafer 1977).

3.6

SUMMARY
The region containing Garner State Park has rich diversity of topography,
vegetation, and fauna. All of these aspects would have been appealing to
prehistoric and historic settlers in the region. The most prominent resource in
the park is the Frio River, which would have provided fresh water, aquatic food
resources, and transportation during high water. The river also supported a
riparian zone along its margins that would have supported abundant wildlife,
pecans, mesquite, and other food resources. The wide range of woody plants in
the park would have also provided fuel, shelter, and tools. Upland areas served
as vantage points and areas of resource acquisition, including chert and
limestone, which can be found on the uplands, and slopes, and within the
channel of the Frio River. Although there were plentiful resources available
locally, the recovery of a basalt flake at 41UV197 suggests resource utilization
south of the Balcones Escarpment.
As stated, the trenching was conducted primarily to assess the geomorphology of
the park rather than as an intensive survey tool for identifying sites. Over the
southern and central portions of the park (within the old park boundaries)
trenching was not exhaustive (only seven trenches) with regard to deeply buried
archeological deposits. These areas have a high potential for deep, intact
deposits that may occur anywhere in the floodplain and possibly extend deeper
than the trenches excavated during this survey reached. In the northeast
portion of the park, however, trenching was exhaustive with regard to cultural
resource identification and delineation. Additional trenching in this area would
be useful during testing to increase resolution on the content and distribution of
more specific elements of Site 41UV468.
Soils in the park range from thin upland rocky sediments to poorly developed
alluvial sediments. Floodplain sediments are prime environments for preserving
archeological deposits. Soils within the Bosque, Atco, and Frio series are all
capable of rapid site burial by slow velocity sediments, which favors site
preservation. Soils in the low uplands are generally shallow or too deflated to
adequately preserve archeological sites. Sites in these locations would likely
manifest on the surface or be shallowly buried by adjacent colluvium. The high
uplands are similar, but the erosion in these areas is more severe. Rockshelters
and caves are an exception to the potential for preserved archeological deposits
in the high uplands, as they are relatively protected from active rain and wind
erosion (however, no archeological deposits were observed in caves during this
survey). Overall, the potential for archeological sites is high throughout the

park. However, the potential for intact, buried archeological deposits is greatest
in the floodplains and possibly the low upland terraces.

REGIONAL CULTURAL HISTORY AND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
By: Bradford Jones and Mason Miller
According to records on the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas, there are 12
archeological sites that have been recorded within one kilometer of Garner State
Park. Three prehistoric sites (41UV9, 41UV33, and 41UV197) have been
identified within the park’s original boundaries while the remainder, are found
either within the park’s later boundaries or beyond (41UV349, 41UV72,
41UV124, 41UV123, 41UV71, 41UV442, 41UV17, 41UV449, and 41UV42). Of
the prehistoric sites, the overwhelming majority are burned rock middens with
accompanying lithic and burned rock scatters (Sites 41UV9, 33, 442, 17 and
42). All other sites are minor surficial lithic scatters and/or quarry areas or are
historic sites that contain such prehistoric components. Historic sites in the
vicinity (Sites 41UV349, 442, and 124) are historic farmstead sites or scatters
associated with the early 20th century.
These sites are but a few of the many prehistoric and historic period sites that
are found within this region of Texas, and in order to appreciate the significance
of these sites and the new sites recorded during the 2008 archeological survey of
Garner State Park, it is necessary to situate them in the broader stream of
regional history. This chapter first presents a brief overview of the cultural
history of Central Texas and the Uvalde County area. An overview of the historic
period is provided in Chapter 6. This prehistoric cultural background is followed
by a review of previous archeological investigations in the park, and a summary
description of the seven archeological sites previously identified. Additional site
descriptions are provided in Chapters 5 and 6 for sites revisited during the
course of the survey, and the reader is referred there for more details.

4.1

REGIONAL CULTURAL PREHISTORY
TPWD’s Garner State Park lies within the northern portion of the Central and
Southern Archeological Planning Region as defined by the THC (MercadoAllinger, et al. 1996). More detailed physiographic and cultural designations
indicate that the project area lies on the southern central boundary of the
Edwards Plateau, primarily within the Central Texas archeological region,
however, the proposed study area also lies in very close proximity to the Lower
Pecos and South Texas archeological regions (Perttula 2004; Suhm et al. 1954)4.
With such a confluence of regional cultural traditions in this part of the state,
the prehistoric record of Garner State Park is predictably varied and diverse;
however, the Central Texas chronological model developed by Collins (2004)
provides the most appropriate temporal framework within which to analyze the
results of the current project. Collins’ chronology incorporates the results of
multiple investigations conducted at several major sites in the greater Central
Texas region including the Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and Pavo Real sites east of
the current project, and the Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2), located in Uvalde
County 21 miles form the park. Following Collins, the chronology is divided into

4

While the Lower Pecos region generally follows the Central Texas chronology, that of South Texas is more varied with a longer, later
Paleoindian and Early and Middle Archaic and a shorter Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric (Perttula 2004). Please refer to Hester (2004) for more
detailed discussion specific to the South Texas archeological region.

Regional Cultural History and Previous Investigations

four main periods with finer grained subperiods: Paleoindian, Archaic (Early,
Middle, & Late), Late Prehistoric, and Historic.
4.1.1

The Paleoindian Period (ca. pre-8800 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period (ca. pre-8800 B.P.) extended from the terminal
Pleistocene into the Holocene and is characterized as a low density population of
wide-ranging nomadic bands. Subsistence patterns during this period may best
be described as a generalized hunting and gathering economy, with a
combination of big-game and smaller faunal hunting as well as the collecting of
plants (Collins 2004; Suhm et al. 1954; Hester 1980). While very limited,
Paleoindian sites in central Texas tend to be located along the eastern ecotonal
region between the Balcones Escarpment and the Blackland Prairie, indicating
an intentional use of the varied resources of both these environmental contexts
(Collins 2004). The Kincaid Rockshelter in Uvalde County (41UV2), dating to the
Paleoindian period, is the best known Paleoindian occupation in the region. One
feature that sets the site apart from other investigated Paleoindian sites was the
discovery of a paved floor dating to this period. When set against the largely
ephemeral campsites typically known from Paleoindian sites in Texas, the
comparatively large amount of labor invested in this construction has been
interpreted to indicate a higher degree of stability and social organization than
what has often been attributed to these early inhabitants (Collins 2004, TBH
2005).

4.1.2

The Archaic Period (8800-1200 B.P)
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the region is increasingly common
throughout the Archaic Period (8800-1200 B.P.), and the Archaic components of
sites such as 41UV21 (Hester 1971), 41UV68 (Miller et al. 2007), 41UV88
(Decker 2000), and 41UV132 (Baker 2003) have been excavated, analyzed, and
published. Archaic Period sites are recognized by the recovery of varied,
temporally diagnostic projectile points that are often associated with evidence of
the intensification of the use of burned rock (burned rock middens, hearths,
scatters, etc.) and other specialized food processing techniques (groundstone
artifacts, etc.), as well as a gradual increase in overall regional population
(Collins 2004:119-122, Black et al. 1997). While the Early Archaic period sites
retained many technological similarities to the Paleoindian period and a
generally low population (Angostura, Early Split Stem, Uvalde-Martindale Points
are common types of Early Archaic; Black and McGraw 1985), the Middle
Archaic hunter-gatherer groups are increasingly distinctive, with a proliferation
of different tool morphologies and cultures as well as a gradual rise in
population (Bell, Andice, Nolan and Travis points are common types of Middle
Archaic; Collins 2004).
The Middle Archaic is climatically defined by
increasingly arid conditions in central Texas, likely spurring the diversification
of food resource utilization, such as plant processing and midden construction
(Karbula et al. 2007, Johnson 1995). The Late Archaic marks a period of
increasing regional moisture and more mesic climatic conditions, with evidence
of continued increase in population and cultural diversity (Pedernales, Montel,
Ensor, and Castroville points are common types of the Late Archaic; Prewitt
1981, Collins 2004). Burned rock middens were still common during the
beginning of this period, gradually decreasing in use through to the Late
Prehistoric.

Regional Cultural History and Previous Investigations

4.1.3

The Late Prehistoric Period (1200-400 B.P.)
The Late Prehistoric (1200-400 B.P.) is marked by the adoption of three main
technologies (in respective chronological order): 1) the adoption of the bow and
arrow; 2) the creation and use of pottery and; 3) the use of agriculture. The
abandonment of the atlatl and dart for the bow and arrow is the most prevalent
marker of the transition to the Late Prehistoric in central Texas with numerous
sites across the region containing much smaller, thinner arrow points (Perdiz,
Toyah, etc. points). While these changes in the material culture assemblages of
the indigenous groups of the region offer an effective means of differentiating
different temporal components and imply changes in local practice, excavations
at sites such as 41UV68 (Miller et al. 2007), 41UV86 (Creel and Goode 1997),
and 41UV132 (Baker 2003) all suggest that the shift in lithic tool types and
technology was not accompanied by significant changes in the broad-based
hunter-gatherer lifeways established at least as early as the Archaic Period
(Collins 2004).

4.2

KINCAID ROCKSHELTER
As this brief overview of the culture history of Uvalde County illustrates, the
region has been occupied by human beings for at least the past 13,000 years if
not longer. The Kincaid Rockshelter (41UV2), located approximately 21 miles
southeast of the park in Uvalde County, is one of the most significant sites in
the region, and its occupational history encapsulates the major trends in the
regional prehistory and history (TBH 2005). The site is found on a slight rise,
beneath a large limestone rock overhang cut by years of erosion from the
Sabinal River and seeping groundwater.
The Kincaid Rockshelter was
investigated by archeologists in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Believed to
have been occupied from the earliest Paleoindian periods to recent times, a span
of more than 13,000 years, the site contains a very extensive cultural chronology
defined within six natural and cultural stratigraphic layers investigated in the
shelter. While older sediments did not bear evidence of human occupation, they
did contain fossil remains of many living and extinct animal species including
horse, camel, mammoth, ground sloth, large cat, wolf, antelope, alligator, and
turtle. During the late Pleistocene, when environmental conditions were moist
and the shelter’s interior was very muddy, the occupants paved the floor with
stones to keep dry (making the pavement the first structural feature in North
America; TBH 2005). These stones indicate a degree of occupational sedentism,
making the site one of very few Clovis period occupational sites (versus kill sites
or temporary camp sites). Unfortunately, significant amounts of disturbance at
the site (both ancient and modern) caused a great deal of mixing of artifacts,
making conclusive relative dating more difficult than at other sites in central
Texas. Among the many artifacts uncovered during the excavations were dart
and arrow points from nearly every interval in central Texas prehistory (ClovisPerdiz), hearths from the Middle and Late Archaic periods, fossil and bone
remains of the occupants’ chosen prey (including extinct Bison antiquus), late
Prehistoric ceramics, human remains from at least four individuals, and a
variety of engraved, scratched, and pigmented stones that possibly served
artistic or ceremonial functions. In addition, the rockshelter also contained a
variety of historic materials including an 1857 half-dime and a confederate
infantry button (TBH 2005).

4.3

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The current project is the largest and most comprehensive archeological survey
to have been conducted within the park. George Kegley (2001) provides a
general summary of previous archeological investigations at Garner, which have
often occurred in piecemeal fashion in response to area specific projects within
or adjacent to the current study area. These investigations consist of both
informal site identification and recording by non-park individuals (Sites 41UV9
and 41UV33), as well as surveys conducted in concert with specific park
improvements or developments that have resulted in the recording of seven
additional sites (Sites 41UV71-73, 41UV123-124, 41UV197, and 41UV349).
Site 41UV9 is a prehistoric burned rock midden located on the east side of the
Frio River. The site was reported by Thomas Hester in 1963 while visiting the
park. No collections were made at that time. Site 41UV33 is located
approximately 80 meters west of the Frio River within the original park tract.
This was recorded as a burned rock midden by Bill Moore in 1971. Both sites,
though poorly documented, were recognized as SALs in 1983, and reevaluation
has been recommended for both sites in the park’s Resource Management Plan
(Kegley 2001). Bill Moore recorded another site, 41UV17, in 1974. Though
limited information is available, this site is described as an Archaic age burned
rock midden containing mussel shell and lithic debitage. It is located in the
southern portion of the current park property on the east bank of the Frio River.
No recommendations on SAL or NRHP eligibility were available.
The earliest organized survey of the park was conducted in 1976 and consisted
of the pedestrian survey of a 25 acre tract in the northern portion of the park,
along the Frio’s right bank (Kegley 2001). During this survey three sites –
41UV71-73 – were recorded. Site 41UV71 is recorded as a prehistoric lithic
chipping station encompassing approximately three acres. Sites 41UV72 and
41UV73 are recorded as lithic procurement locales approximately 18 and 1.3
acres in size, respectively. All three of these sites were assumed to be
approximately 90 percent intact with very shallow deposits and were officially
designated as SALs in 1983.
A 1983 survey along the course of a buried telephone cable on the east edge of
the park adjacent to FM 2748 was carried out by Ron Ralph on the behalf of
TPWD. A prehistoric quarry site (41UV123), a twentieth century trash dump
(41UV124), and the remnants of a burned rock midden demolished by road
construction (not registered as a site) were all recorded. The previously recorded
site of 41UV9 was also revisited at this time. Site 41UV123 was reported to be a
lithic procurement locale with a possible burned rock midden approximately 30
meters east of the Frio River. No subsurface testing was conducted. Site
41UV124, located approximately 50 meters east of the Frio River, consists of a
surficial scatter of historic debris that could be a result of 20th century trash
dumping. Both sites were estimated to be 90 percent intact and were designated
as SALs in 1984.
Seven years later, a 1990 TPWD survey of areas to be potentially impacted by
the replacement of an overhead power line resulted in the identification of Site
41UV197. This site consisted of a surficial scatter of burned limestone and
chert, three bifaces, and lithic debitage; however, no subsurface testing was
conducted. Surface disturbance was noted and the site was not recommended
for designation as an SAL.

Regional Cultural History and Previous Investigations

Subsequent survey and testing in advance of improvements to the Oakmont,
Pecan Grove, Shady Meadows and river Crossing camping areas during the fall
of 1991 and the winter of 1992. No sites were identified in the course of these
investigations (Kegley 2001).
In 1994 Kegley (2001) recorded Site 41UV349, a historic home site, within the
floodplain of the Frio River while surveying for the new park headquarters and
entrance road. Although the superstructure had been removed by this time,
artifacts observed on the surface dated to the early 20th century. A cedar post
foundation, stone chimney rubble pile, limestone slab-lined front walkway, fence
posts, and possibly a collapsed well were extant at the site. No subsurface
testing was conducted and the site was not recommended for designation as an
SAL.
In 2003, Site 41UV442 was recorded by TPWD archeologists in the vicinity Site
41UV17. This site also contains a burned rock midden in addition to lithic tools
and debitage and a 20th century historic scatter. Midden deposits were
observed to a depth of at least 20 centimeters below the surface and additional
surface investigation and shovel testing was recommended.
It was
recommended as potentially eligible for SAL and NRHP designation.
The most recent survey to have implications for our knowledge of the
archeological heritage of Garner State Park was conducted by SWCA, whose
investigations for proposed improvements to FM 1050 adjacent to Garner State
Park property in 2005 identified Site 41UV449. This site consists of a low
density of buried lithic material. This site was mapped, perhaps erroneously,
within the northeastern portion of the park on the broad flood terrace of the Frio
River. The site consisted of three pieces of lithic debitage and one core that were
found between 30 and 90 centimeters below the surface. No further work was
recommended for the portion of the site surveyed, but additional trenching was
recommended if the terrace south of FM 1050 was to be impacted.

EVIDENCE OF PREHISTORIC OCCUPATION
AT GARNER STATE PARK
By: Matthew Stotts and John Campbell

5.1

UPLAND AND INTERMEDIATE LANDFORM SITES
These sites are located within the high uplands, sideslopes, and footslopes of the
park. A total of six prehistoric sites were identified within this subgroup:
41UV33, 41UV349, 41UV466, 41UV469, 41UV472, and 41UV473. All of these
sites contain prehistoric components consisting of low to moderate density
scatters of lithic debitage and burned rock, with a small number of formal tools
as well as two projectile points from Site 41UV466. Two of these sites, 41UV472
and 41UV349, also contain historic components. These sites are all located in
the southern and western portion of the park. All of these site areas suffer from
moderate to severe erosion and therefore the archeological deposits manifest on
the surface. Preservation on these sites is poor, exhibiting little or no organic
preservation and surficial artifacts that are out of their original context. In the
case of Site 41UV473, all the artifacts appear to be in secondary context having
migrated down slope. The prehistoric artifact assemblages generally reflect early
stage lithic production with a few finished tools found in the uplands, with an
increase in tool occurrence on intermediate landform sites. The high upland
sites are consistent with upland sites in the region and most likely represent
temporary campsites focused on exploiting lithic resources and game. Within
the intermediate landform sites, the artifact assemblage is small and of a low
density, which leaves questions as to the function of these sites. These sites are
discussed in more detail below.
5.1.1

Site 41UV33
Setting
Located on a narrow upland bench, Site 41UV33 overlooks the Frio River
floodplain to the north and northeast (Plate 3). Evidence of heavy sheet erosion
is visible across the surface of the site, which is covered in large limestone
cobbles and leaf litter from the surrounding dense cedar woods and scattered
oak trees. Surface visibility ranged from 5 to 85 percent across the site. Rock
outcrop is mapped on these steep slopes with very little Real association soil.
Bedrock was found at depths of no greater than 15 centimeters.
Description
Site 41UV33 consists of a small and concentrated accumulation of lithic tools,
burned rock, and debitage that is confined to the ground surface and shallow
upland soil atop limestone bedrock. Although the original site record indicates
the presence of a burned rock midden that had been almost completely
destroyed by looting, no evidence of such a feature remains. Site 41UV33 is
located at approximately 1,450 feet above mean sea level (AMSL). The site
occupies approximately 600 square meters of a gradually sloping bench on the
north face of a steep side-slope and is most evident where heavy erosion has
occurred. Two shovel tests (GS12 and GS13) were excavated, one of which was
positive for cultural material. Three biface fragments and one edge modified
flake were collected from the ground surface. The site has been impacted by

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

43

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

erosion, historic tree clearing related to the use of the original park entrance
road, and looting. It is estimated that the site is less than 30 percent intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
Though only a single burned broken flake was recovered from subsurface
testing, four non-diagnostic lithic tools were collected from the surface (Figure
5.1). Three of these artifacts were bifaces, including two proximal fragments
(Lots 1 and 2) and a medial fragment (Lot 3), while the fourh artifact is defined
as an edge-modified flake (Lot 4). Flaking along the edge of this artifact is
bifacial, and it appears to have been extensively utilized as a cutting or scraping
tool.

Figure 5.1: Tools collected from Site 41UV33. Top (L-R): Biface fragments (Lots 1, 3);
Bottom (L-R): Bioface fragment (Lot 2); Edge-modified flake (Lot 4).
Discussion
Site 41UV33 is a SAL located atop a small, relatively flat terrace.
The
outcropping limestone bedrock bench is covered in limestone and chert cobbles,
within which investigators located a dense scatter of prehistoric lithics and
burned rock. No discernable features were noted, although a burned rock
midden may have once been present (Kegley 2001). It is unclear under what
Criteria 41UV33 was formally nominated for SAL listing. Given the evidence of
looting it exhibited at the time of recording, it was likely under Criterion 5
(which protects sites that are subject to disturbance and/or looting through
penalties and fines). This criterion is still applicable. Artifacts observed include
lithic debitage (mostly tertiary flakes), burned rock, and tool fragments. One
flake was collected from Shovel Test GS13 at 15 centimeters below the surface
along with three biface fragments and one edge modified flake that were found
on the ground surface. Due to the large presence of outcropping chert in the
area, it is likely that the site area was utilized as a lithic procurement resource.
A few historic artifacts, including beer cans and bottle fragments were also noted

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

44

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

but considered insignificant due to the site’s close proximity to the park road.
The research potential of 41UV33 is very low but the site should be periodically
monitored by park officials due to the ease of access by park guests and
potential for erosion.
5.1.2

Site 41UV466
Setting
This expansive, multiple component site occupies the peaks and inter-ridge
saddles in the southern portion of the park (Plate 3). Exposed limestone
bedrock, chert and limestone gravel deposits, with pockets of thin humic soil
characterize the Rock Outcrop-Real Association soil mapped in this area (see
Figures 2.3 and 2.4 for typical site terrain). The ground surface is sparsely
covered in patchy grass, cacti, and cedar and oak stands affording
approximately 80 to 100 percent surface visibility.
Description
Site 41UV466 is a large and diffuse upland scatter of lithic tools and debitage
with a historic, dry-stacked limestone boundary fence traversing the
southeastern portion of the site. A detailed description of the historic site
component can be found in the following chapter on historic occupation. The
prehistoric site component covers approximately 66 acres along the high
ridgetops, primarily above 1,700 feet AMSL. The site is described as a diffuse
surficial scatter of lithics and isolated burned rocks dotted with occasional
pockets of more dense utilization surrounding chert nodule outcrops
(Figure 5.2). A likely Angostura dart point and an Edwards/Scallorn arrow
point were collected from the ground surface. Burned rocks were difficult to
discern amongst the sheets of limestone cobbles in the site area and, when
noted, were extremely diffuse. Eight shovel tests were excavated on the site with
none containing buried prehistoric materials, confirming the surficial nature of
artifact deposition. The site has been impacted by erosion and the construction
of park trails. Recreational use of the area has likely resulted in the collection
and disturbance of surface artifacts; it is estimated that approximately 30
percent of the site remains intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
As a large area of lithic procurement, the artifacts observed on the site surface
primarily reflected the testing of outcropping lithic resources and some early
stage lithic reduction. The most common artifacts observed were large primary
and secondary flakes and cores or tested cobbles (Figure 5.3). Much of the
lithic material on the surface was of very poor quality and was primarily
classified as angular shatter with large amounts of surface cortex. This was
found interspersed with occasional flakes that exhibited the typical
characteristics of debitage – defined platforms, bulbs of percussion – and a small
number of tools including edge modified flakes, bifaces, and two projectile points
(Figure 5.4). Presumably the assemblage reflects a pattern of natural resource
procurement for more intensive use in other site contexts (such as the types of
sites found along the river).

lower right corner (Lot 3) refit.
The two diagnostic artifacts found, both projectile points, indicate a long period
of site use and visitation. The first specimen is a lanceolate projectile point
fragment which had been broken on the distal end. Its white coloration is a
result of extensive weathering (Figure 5.4 – Lot 1). Though significantly altered

by breakage and reworking, the general appearance of the specimen suggests
that it was originally finely flaked with parallel converging flakes and likely had
ground basal edges. The overall shape and the ground edges suggest that this
artifact is typologically within the range of Angostura dart points, though it is
somewhat small (Turner and Hester 1999: 73-74). Angostura points are
generally assigned to the Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic period. The modified
edge angles of the specimen also suggest significant resharpening over the uselife of the tool. The resharpening of the tool may in part account for its small
size for an Angostura point. Based on the characteristics of the negative flake
scar, the final break appears to be the result of an impact fracture emanating
from the distal tip (Johnson 1979: 25).
The second projectile point found during the recording of 41UV466 was a small
medial arrow point fragment (Figure 5.4 – Lot 2). The stem of this specimen is
missing, but the overall characteristics strongly suggest it should be classified
as an Edwards or Scallorn arrow point (Turner and Hester 1999). Typologically
these two points are very similar, but the missing stem and base make
clarification impossible.
Stylistically this specimen is similar to a point
recovered in association with a small hearth at Site 41UV68 in the town of
Uvalde (Miller et al. 2007). Radiocarbon samples from Site 41UV68 date to the
late Prehistoric period, around 1300 AD.
Discussion
Site 41UV466 encompasses the majority of the upland ridgetops in the southern
portion of Garner State Park. The expansive scatter of prehistoric artifacts
occurs in relatively discreet clusters in areas with exposed chert-bearing
limestone. The low density of artifacts and the limited types suggest that the

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

47

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

prehistoric use of the area was limited to short-term camps or visitation focused
on lithic resource procurement and possible opportunistic tool manufacture.
Debitage density was generally much lower than other regional quarry sites
previously observed by the Principal Investigator (such as Sites 41CM297-298 –
Miller 2006, 41CC310 – Miller et al. 2003), which could indicate severe erosion
and displacement. The presence of a (likely) Angostura dart point and an
Edwards/Scallorn arrow point suggests long term utilization of the area,
extending from the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric.
Furthermore, a stone fence extending through the site area (see Chapter 6)
extends site utilization into the historic period as well. Site 41UV466 is confined
to the ground surface and exhibits very low research potential. No further
archeological investigation is recommended. The site is, however, recommended
for designation as a SAL under Criterion 5, due to its location in a high visibility
portion of the park with heavy foot traffic. As a testament to looting potential,
surveyors noted a biface adjacent to the foot trail during the orientation hike,
marked its location and returned to the site the next day to find it gone. The
risk of vandalism and relic collecting is very high and sufficient to warrant legal
protection. The trails should be regularly monitored for evidence of continued
looting and additional mitigative actions such as controlled surface collecting
should be considered if monitoring indicates continued vandalism.
5.1.3

Site 41UV472
Setting
Site 41UV472 is a small prehistoric and historic surface scatter located on an
upland hilltop in the western portion of Garner State Park. Exposed limestone
bedrock and cobbles cover most of the surface. Vegetation is almost exclusively
cedar trees with a few live oaks and very little patchy grass between areas of
exposed rock. The silty clay loam in this area belongs to the Kerrville and Real
soil groups on hilly terrain and approximately 10 percent of the ground surface
is visible.
Description
The site area of 41UV472 covers approximately 1,600 square meters, but may
have once extended farther to the north before being destroyed by the park road.
Site boundaries were defined by the extent of the artifact scatter visible on the
ground surface. Two negative shovel tests were excavated in the northern and
southern portions of the site (Shovel Tests GS10 and 11). Shovel tests were
terminated at 20 and 40 centimeters below the surface where limestone bedrock
was encountered. The site has been disturbed by recreational and residential
activity related to park operation, erosion, and potentially disrupted by
construction. The site is estimated to be approximately 10 percent intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
No materials were collected from site 41UV472 during the current
investigations. Observed artifacts include mostly secondary lithic debitage and
occasional burned limestone. A very small scatter of recent or late historic trash
was noted including brown, clear and aqua bottle glass, and punch-top metal
cans intermixed with the prehistoric artifacts.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

48

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Discussion
Site 41UV472 consists of a sparse scatter of lithic debitage, burned limestone,
and historic trash on the edge of an upland hilltop. No diagnostic artifacts were
found to accurately assess the temporal period of prehistoric occupation, but
artifact density is very low and comprised primarily of large flakes from tested
cobbles and early stage lithic reduction. Due to the sparse lithic scatter and
associated burned limestone, it is likely that Site 41UV472 represents a shortterm prehistoric camp related to hunting and/or lithic resource procurement
activity. The historic site component is minor and may be related to hunting.
The research potential of Site 41UV472 is very low and no further archeological
investigation is recommended. Given 41UV472’s close proximity to the park
road and its impacts from previous construction, it is recommended for listing
as a SAL under Criterion 5.
5.1.4

Site 41UV473
Setting
Site 41UV473 is likely a secondary deposition of prehistoric material located on
a relatively flat upland finger ridge overlooking a tributary creek (for
representative image of site area, see Figure 2.8). Artifacts were observed
continuing a short distance upslope before dissipating into the scree. The
general area is situated on a cedar and oak wooded finger ridge between two
intermittent stream channels. Low vegetation consists of scattered prickly pear
cacti and both tall and short grasses. Very little soil exists on the side-slopes in
this area, which is defined by outcropping rock with sparse Real association clay
loam, mostly accumulating as a result of colluvial activity. Soils on the terrace
itself reached a maximum of 15 centimeters before contact with bedrock. As a
testament to the area’s minimal deposition and colluvial redeposition, natural
limestone cobbles are visible across the ground surface, of which 10 to 70
percent is visible across the site.
Description
Site 41UV473 is a diffuse upland scatter of lithic debitage and burned limestone
fragments of possible cultural origin. The site covers approximately 2,000
square meters on an upland ridge, extending up the side-slope to the extent to
which the steep terrain could be surveyed. The presence of artifacts in such an
area is indicative of secondary deposition from a location (likely a more
inhabitable location such as 41UV466) upslope. No diagnostic artifacts were
observed and no artifacts were collected. Two shovel tests were excavated on the
site, which were negative for cultural material (Shovel Tests BJ9 and BJ10).
Both tests revealed very shallow soil, terminating at bedrock encountered at
depths of five and fifteen centimeters below the surface. The site has been
created by, rather than impacted by, erosion and is therefore not considered to
be intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
No materials were collected from site 41UV473 during the current
investigations. Very few artifacts were observed on the surface, however
surveyors noted one flake, angular chert shatter, and possible limestone firecracked rock (FCR) scattered diffusely across the landform.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

49

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Discussion
While technically an archeological site, 41UV473 likely represents a secondary
accumulation of artifacts that have washed down a steep side-slope in the
southern portion of Garner State Park.
Artifact density is very sparse,
consisting of lithic debitage and angular chert and limestone fragments
attributed to thermal fracturing. This thermal fracturing often occurs as a
result of cultural activity (i.e. heat from cooking features, etc.), but in this case
the cause is uncertain due to a lack of contextual integrity. Since the site likely
constitutes an accumulation of secondary deposition, research potential of Site
41UV473 very low. No further archeological investigation is recommended. Site
41UV473 is not recommended for designation as an SAL because it does not
appear to meet any of the SAL criteria.
5.1.5

Site 41UV469
Setting
This small, prehistoric lithic scatter is located on a southeasterly sloping hill in
the western portion of Garner State Park. This area is characterized by gently
rolling hills in an intermediate topographical transition zone between the low
flood terrace of the Frio River to the east and the steep, rugged upland hills to
the west. Shallow silty loam belonging to the Kerville and Real soil associations
are found in this area. Cedar trees and scattered oaks cover the site with
minimal surface vegetation, affording approximately 75 percent surface visibility.
Chert and limestone cobbles along with outcropping bedrock are visible across
the surface.
Description
Site 41UV469 consists of a scatter of lithic debitage, burned rock, a uniface,
tested cobbles, and one chert core lying on the ground surface. Five shovel tests
were excavated to help define the horizontal and vertical extent of the site
(Shovel Tests GS34-36, MM11 and 12), of which one was positive for a single
burned rock between zero and nine centimeters below the ground surface
(MM11). Bedrock was encountered at depths ranging between five and sixteen
centimeters below the surface in all shovel tests. The site covers an area
roughly 35 meters east to west by 20 meters north to south (700 square meters)
at an elevation of 1,466 feet AMSL. Site 41UV469 has been impacted by
occasional foot traffic and sheet erosion and is estimated to be approximately 10
to 20 percent intact within a poor depositional context.
Materials Collected/Observed
No materials were collected from Site 41UV469 during the current
investigations. Observed artifacts at the site consisted of primary and secondary
flakes at a density of one flake per 15 to 20 square meters. All flakes were
diffusely intermixed with natural chert chunks and nodules while only
occasional burned rocks were observed. One 8.5 by 5 centimeter uniface was
noted adjacent to Shovel Test MM 11, but no other tools or diagnostics were
noted.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

50

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Discussion
Site 41UV469 is a small, surficial scatter of primarily lithic debitage and burned
rock located at the base of the rugged upland ridge surrounding the broad Frio
River flood terrace. Its topographical position would have provided easy access
to both the riverfront and upland resources. Owing to the presence of primarily
secondary and tertiary flakes, tested cobbles, and a chert core, it is possible that
Site 41UV469 was utilized as a lithic procurement locale by prehistoric
inhabitants. The research potential of Site 41UV469 is very low and no further
investigation is recommended. The site is not in a highly trafficked part of
Garner State Park, and as such, is not recommended for SAL designation.
5.1.6

Site 41UV475
Site 41UV475 was recorded when surveyors returned to the mapped location of
Site 41UV349, but found no evidence of the historic farmstead ruin that
composed the site (see Chapter 6). Archeologists did record a historic scatter
that could be related to gas/oil exploration and a moderate, surficial prehistoric
lithic scatter. These materials were recorded as 41UV475.
Setting
This multi-component historic and prehistoric site is situated at the easternmost
edge of the intermediate upland area to the west of the Frio River flood terrace.
The site area is largely open with occasionally dense stands of cedar and live oak
trees which obscure the ground surface with leaf litter. Exposed limestone
bedrock is visible in many spots, particularly in the southern third of the site,
and the remaining open areas are covered with short and tall grasses and
scattered prickly pear cacti which provide an overall surface visibility of
approximately 60 to 75 percent. Shallow silty loam belonging to the Kerrville
and Real soil associations did not extend in depth beyond sixteen centimeters
below the ground surface.
Description
The overall site dimensions were extended to encompass an area of
approximately 21,600 square meters. Within this area, the densest
concentration of lithic tools and debitage occurs in the southeastern portion of
the site, atop an exposed limestone bedrock shelf along the edge of the upland
landform (Figure 5.5).
Sparsely scattered artifacts were, however, found
throughout the majority of eastern portion of the site with none observed to the
west. Two shovel tests, MS17 and MM22, were excavated to depths of sixteen
and seven centimeters (respectively). Both were terminated at bedrock with no
subsurface artifact recovery. The site is located approximately 100 meters east
southeast of Site 41UV469 at a slightly lower elevation ranging between 1,410
and 1,450 feet AMSL. The prehistoric site component has been impacted by the
historic occupation including a two-track road that traverses the site from east
to west, as well as a transmission line corridor that crosses the eastern portion
of the site from north to south. The prehistoric portion of the site is estimated to
be approximately 25 percent intact.

Figure 5.5: Limestone bedrock shelf that contained majority of prehistoric component to
Site 41UV475.
Materials Collected/Observed
No materials were collected from Site 41UV475 during the current
investigations. Observed artifacts include primary and secondary flakes, a few
tertiary flakes, occasional burned rock, one medial biface fragment in the dirt
road, and several expedient core tools or rejected cobbles in the primary stage of
reduction (Figure 5.6). A curious accumulation of lithics was also noted on a
small limestone shelf near Shovel Test MM22, which is potentially a cull pile left
by visitors who have happened upon the site (Figure 5.7).

Discussion
Located along the western margin of the Frio River flood terrace, the prehistoric
materials present at Site 41UV475 indicate probable resource gathering activity
as opposed to long-term occupation. The artifact assemblage of this site differs
from the artifacts observed and collected from all other prehistoric sites located
within the project area. These artifacts seem to represent a limited focus of
activity. With the exception of one more finely edge modified scraping tool, the
core tools observed were large, roughly flaked and may be hand-held chopping
or cutting tools.
The cultural significance of Site 41UV475’s prehistoric
component is very limited and the research potential of Site 41UV475 is
considered to be low. While the site is not in imminent danger of extensive
vandalism, nor does it meet the remaining SAL significance criteria, the possible
cull pile may be an indication of some looting. Beyond periodic monitoring for
continued vandalism activity, no further archeological work is necessary (though
impacts to the site should be avoided). If continued looting is noted, a controlled
surface collection is recommended. Site 41UV475 should be listed as a SAL
under Criterion 5.

5.2

LOWLAND/TERRACE SITES
These sites are located within the older and younger alluvial sediments of the
Frio River floodplain. A total of five prehistoric sites were identified within this
subgroup, 41UV9, 41UV73, 41UV197, 41UV468, and 41UV471. The prehistoric
components of these sites consist of moderate to high density scatters of lithic
debitage and burned rock, three burned rock midden sites, burned rock
features, formal tools, and projectile points. With the exception of Sites 41UV73
and 41UV471, these sites are all located within the floodplain of the Frio River
and have been buried, either entirely or partially, by alluvial sediments. These
sites contrast with the sites in the uplands in that they represent more
permanent occupations.
The artifact assemblage on all of the sites is

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

53

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

characterized by numerous burned rocks and primarily late stage lithic
reduction, which is also reflected in the increased presence of formal tools. The
presence of burned rock middens at three of the sites, 41UV9, 41UV73, and
41UV471, also indicates a more permanent settlement pattern in the lowlands
and possibly a focus on plant foraging subsistence. This pattern is not
surprising, however, as the proximity to water, availability of expedient lithic
resources (river cobbles), game, and plant material would have been attractive to
groups living in the region. These sites are discussed in more detail below.
5.2.1

Site 41UV197
Setting
Located on the broad flood terrace of the Frio River, Site 41UV197 is a large
multi-component site along the north side of a seasonal creek drainage
(Plate 3). Most of the area is covered with maintained grasses and occasional,
large pecan and oak trees that are concentrated around the site periphery
(Figure 5.8). Near the northern periphery, the site occupies a prominent gravel
bar that is currently used as an impromptu campfire area (Figure 5.9). Soils
include Atco loam in the northern portion of the site and frequently flooded
Frio/Oakalla silty clay loam in the southern half. Throughout the site, these
alluvial soils typically extended beyond one meter in depth. Surface visibility
ranges between zero and 100 percent across the site.

Site 41UV197.

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Figure 5.9: Northern gravel bar area.
Description
Originally recorded as a small scatter of prehistoric debitage and tools
immediately west of the Frio River, Site 41UV197 was redefined by the current
investigation to encompass approximately 100,000 square meters, occupying the
River Bend camping area and extending 650 meters to the west between a
tributary drainage and the southern edge of the CCC camp (41UV474). The site
contains a minor historic component of likely camping-related trash found
mainly in the western portions that is discussed in the following chapter. A total
of 18 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated to assist in
determining the horizontal and vertical extent of cultural deposition. Although
the site is large, artifact density is very low; with approximately one artifact per
10-20 square meters. Artifacts were observed on the surface and found up to a
depth of 200 centimeters. Surficial exposure of lithics was most pronounced
north of the original property fenceline where the site overlaps a gravel bar.
Archeologists noted one possible burned rock hearth feature immediately
adjacent to Shovel Test MM8. Tested cobbles and primary flakes litter the
ground surface in this location. The cluster of six to 10, small to medium
burned limestone cobbles was exposed on the ground surface. No other features
were noted. The relatively flat, open terrace is at around 1,400 feet AMSL and
has been heavily impacted by surface grading for the construction of camping
facilities including shelter sites, underground utilities installation, and paved
roads. The CCC caliche pit occupies part of the northern portion of the site.
Investigators estimate that approximately 30 percent of the site remains intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
Historic artifacts that were collected from trenching and shovel testing will be
discussed in the following chapter. A total of 17 prehistoric artifacts were
collected from Site 41UV197 including debitage, an edge modified tertiary flake,
a core fragment, two pieces of heat shatter/FCR, and one artifact of uncertain

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

origin. Though it has the basic appearance of a flake, the specimen is clearly
stream rolled, and may be an incidental flake occurring as a result of natural
impact fractures. Artifacts came from four shovel tests (JC7, MS6, MM5, and
MM8) and two backhoe trenches (BHT5 and BHT7), and were recovered between
20 and 200 centimeters below the current ground surface. In addition to the
artifacts collected from subsurface testing, two unifaces were noted amongst the
varied tested cobbles and chert shatter on the gravel bar area. Finally, two
black basalt flakes were collected from the surface of an impromptu river access
trail that descended from a campground to the Frio. The flakes were found
amongst a diffuse scatter of lithics exposed along the access trail. While these
flakes are rather insignificant in terms of temporal or functional association,
they are not of “local” origin and therefore indicate manual transport of raw
lithic material from a distance of at least 15 or 20 miles to the south, where the
nearest source of this material can be found (BEG 1983). Although the sample
is far too small to characterize the types of activities that have been associated
with the deposition of the artifacts, their general small size and tertiary
classification strongly suggest they are from prepared cores.
Discussion
Site 41UV197 is a large surficial and buried prehistoric campsite located at the
confluence of the Frio River and an unnamed seasonal drainage. Because of the
scarcity of artifacts and burned rock (perhaps due to heavy surface disturbance)
it is difficult to assign a functional typology or relative period of occupational
duration to the site. Artifact density was greatest in the area immediately
adjacent to the river, with artifacts visible on the bare surface, although this
could easily be a result of increased surface visibility rather than actual artifact
distribution. One possible hearth feature was noted adjacent to Shovel Test
MM8. Site 41UV474, which lies within the boundaries of Site 41UV197 relates
to the CCC construction Camp Garner only and prehistoric components found
within this smaller site are considered part of the latter. From what was
encountered during this survey, Site 41UV197 exhibits very little research
potential but should continue to be monitored by park officials, particularly in
regard to heavy foot traffic along the terrace edge, which is depleting surface
vegetation and hastening soil erosion. Due to the highly accessible site location,
Site 41UV197 is recommended for designation as an SAL under Criterion 5 to
protect the remaining cultural deposits. Though artifacts were encountered at
significant depths within the site boundaries, these items were very diffuse and
lacked associated features. That does not mean that significant, deep deposits
could remain within 41UV197. As such, the site is also recommended for listing
as a SAL under Criterion 2. Aside from recreational use of the area, there are no
proposed impacts to the site and no further investigation is recommended at
this time. Since Site 41UV197 likely continues northeast to Site 41UV71, if
future work is to impact the unsurveyed area to the north of Site 41UV197,
additional survey and shovel testing is recommended due to the possibility of
encountering significant buried deposits or features.

Site 41UV9
Setting
A large burned rock midden site is located on the east bank of the Frio River
(Plate 3, Figure 5.10-5.11). The site is perched on the edge of the first terrace
immediately overlooking the rocky riverbed. A paved road that once provided
access to an inactive portion of the park forms the western edge of Site 41UV9.

Figure 5.11: Burned rock midden at Site 41UV9.
The site is naturally bounded on the northern edge by a steep break in the high
terrace but the eastern limit was not thoroughly investigated beyond the
boundary of the current survey area. The site area is wooded with a mixture of
large oak trees and cedar undergrowth, particularly in areas that have been
cleared. Frequently flooded Orif soils are mapped in the site area, which consist
of silty loam and clay loam. Although the large midden is highly visible, leaf
litter obscures much of the surface, affording approximately 25 percent surface
visibility.
Description
Site 41UV9 is a massive burned rock midden site that can be easily seen on the
east bank of the Frio River within the old boundary of Garner State Park. The
midden itself is approximately 15 meters north to south by 30 meters east to
west. Overall site dimensions are approximately 50 meters (N-S) by 80 meters
(E-W), but may extend further to the east than was surveyed during the course
of the current investigation. At least three looter pits were evident in the side of
the burned rock midden, which is largely intact and covers the south side and
base of a high terrace (Figure 5.12). In the 1950s a picnic table was
constructed at the edge of this midden deposit, that remains in a weathered
state but is no longer in use (for a representation of picnic bench, refer to
Chapter 6 and Figure 6.50). Six shovel tests were excavated to help define the
southern site boundary, four of which were positive for cultural material. Shovel
Test MM9 contained three intact, clustered burned rocks at approximately 35
centimeters below the surface that are likely either midden talus or midden
progenitor features (Karbula et al. 2007:101-167). Artifacts were encountered to
a maximum depth of 90 centimeters below the surface. The site is found at
approximately 1,380 to 1,390 feet AMSL in an area that has been frequently
flooded and subject to sheet erosion. Artificial impacts include the construction
of a park road and picnic tables in the 1950s, recreational use of the site area,

property fences, a telephone pole, and looting activity. The site is estimated to
be approximately 60 percent intact.

Figure 5.12: Typical looters’ pit at Site 41UV9.
Materials Collected/Observed
A total of 109 artifacts were collected from shovel tests dug at the site of 41UV9
while numerous cores and flakes were observed on the ground surface. Only one
tool fragment was recovered. This artifact is the medial section of a biface with a
serrated edge and a slight alternate bevel, but because of the small size of the
fragment it is not clear if the original tool was a projectile point or a more
generalized bifacial blade (Lot 15) (Figure 5.13). The most common artifact type
recovered was debitage (N=92), consisting of small secondary (N=8) and tertiary
flakes (N=27), and a majority of broken flakes (N=56). Only a single, very small,
primary flake was recovered. In addition, 14 pieces of chert shatter, likely debris
from lithic reduction or the fracturing of chert nodules as a consequence of heat
or other natural processes, were recovered as well as two pieces of fire cracked
rock. Based on the secondary and tertiary flake types, the debitage appears to
pertain to primarily later stage biface thinning and/or tool refurbishing.
Discussion
The large burned rock midden suggests that Site 41UV9 represents the remains
of a long-term occupational site where a number of daily activities, such as
those related to food processing and preparation, are likely to have occurred.
The midden accumulation itself consists of a very dense aggregate of burned and
angular limestone cobbles, burned chert, and lithic debitage. Artifact density
was very high on the top of the terrace and in the area immediately surrounding
the burned rock midden, but quickly tapered off moving to the south. Just
beyond the old park boundary to the north and immediately west of the burned
rock midden, the high terrace drops off steeply, creating a natural site
boundary.

The presence of a long-term occupation site with a largely intact burned rock
midden and the potential for buried features presents a high potential for
contributing valuable information toward a regional understanding of prehistoric
site formation. While the mapped boundaries are likely complete, survey farther
east may reveal additional components. The site is listed as a SAL likely under
Criterion 5 but also falls under eligibility Criteria 1 and 2. It should continue to
be routinely monitored by park personnel to keep track of and possibly deter site
depletion as a result of illegal activity. If looting continues, additional actions,
such as mitigation, may be required. Impacts to the site should be avoided, but
if unavoidable, formal NRHP eligibility testing should occur to accurately assess
the
site
composition
and
significance.

recommendations, including gating, vegetational screens, looters pit treatment,
etc. are described in Appendix A.

Site 41UV73
Setting
This large prehistoric open camp is located in the northern portion of Garner
State Park (Plate 2). The site is situated on a very high terrace overlooking the
Frio River to the northeast. Campsites currently occupy the site area, which is
largely open with scattered oak trees and cedar stands. Soils in this area are
very thin and are classified as Atco loam in the northern portion of the site and
Speck soils in the south. The surface texture consists of dry silty clay. Surface
vegetation mainly consists of short and tall grasses and scattered patches of
prickly pear cactus that, along with leaf litter, afford surface visibility that
ranges from zero to 100 percent across the site.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Description
Site 41UV73 is a broad scatter of burned limestone, lithic debitage, and tools
located along the southwest edge of the Frio River. The site is laterally
expansive, extending for approximately 350 meters along the edge of the high
bluff, but artifacts were observed no greater than about 50 meters southwest of
the bluff edge. The current investigations expand the site to the north from its
originally mapped location to encompass an area that is roughly 17,500 square
meters in size. Most notably, the site contains an approximately 10-meter
diameter burned rock midden, which is centered directly beneath a cement
picnic table pad at a campsite in the northern portion of the site. The midden is
composed of large angular pieces of burned limestone with chert flakes
interspersed and scattered around the remainder of the area. This area is also
the densest artifact accumulation as archeologists recovered two projectile point
bases along with a possible projectile point perform from the ground surface.
Archeologists excavated two shovel tests, which recovered artifacts to a
maximum depth of 30 centimeters (Shovel Tests MM100-101). Both were
excavated near the bluff edge and revealed shallow soil containing artifacts from
the surface to bedrock. The area has been impacted by the construction of park
facilities including a restroom, the paved campsite loop, buried utilities routing
and the subsequent recreational use of the area. The site has undoubtedly been
subject to uncontrolled collection of surface artifacts by park guests and is
estimated to be approximately 70 percent intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
Prehistoric artifacts were found to occur in a high density on the surface across
much of the site area. The most common artifact types observed were lithic
debitage and burned rock. The burned rock was a combination of chert and
limestone. Most debitage was relatively small in size and consisted of the types
of secondary and tertiary flakes associated with middle to later stages of lithic
tool manufacture or tool rejuvenation and flake production from prepared cores.
Tools included edge modified flakes, bifacial tools, and projectile points. A nearly
complete projectile point was collected from the surface that bears strong
stylistic affinity with the Gower or Uvalde types (Lot 6) along with another
bifurcated basal fragment that is also likely Gower or Uvalde (Lot 7) (Figure
5.14). Points such as this are attributed to the Early Archaic period of
prehistoric occupation in the region. An abandoned bifacially reduced flake may
be a side-notched projectile point perform (Lot 9). Another very finely worked
stem fragment was also collected from the surface, but was too incomplete for
positive identification (Lot 8).
Artifact recovery from the two shovel tests excavated at the site reflects the
composition of the surface scatters. A total of 21 pieces of debitage and nine
pieces of shatter or fire cracked rock were recovered from the shallow soil
deposits sampled on the site. The most common type of debitage was late stage
tertiary manufacturing debris (N=10), but also included four secondary flakes
and seven broken flakes. No tools or diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the
shovel testing.

Discussion
Site 41UV73 is a broad scatter of lithic debitage, tools and burned rock, which
contains one dense burned-rock midden. Based upon the recovery of the two
Gower/Uvalde points, the site likely represents an Early Archaic occupation.
Most of the debitage across the terrace consists of secondary or tertiary flakes
from tool production and reworking activity. This contrasts the assemblages
encountered in the upland areas, which more strongly suggest resource
gathering activity. Ten centimeters of red clay was encountered in Shovel Test
MS101, from 20 centimeters to bedrock, which may have been sterile with
artifacts becoming mixed from the upper zone while digging. A low density
scatter of artifacts was observed eroding down the face of the bluff onto the
riverbank.
The shallowness of soil, along with disturbance in the area of the site, limits the
potential productivity of further excavation. The site is a listed SAL and should
remain a protected resource that is preserved in place. While there is no
information available regarding which SAL criterion was used for nomination,
41UV73 was likely listed under Criterion 5, due to its close proximity to park
visitors and high potential for vandalism. This continues to be applicable. It is
recommended that Site 41UV73 be systematically studied to observe the impact
of human activity and natural processes on surficial archeological sites. With
the potential for such a study, Site 41UV73 is also eligible for SAL listing under
Criterion 4. A detailed methodology for this proposed action will be discussed in
the attached park management plan (Appendix A).

5.2.4

Site 41UV468
Setting
On the east bank of the Frio River, investigators encountered a buried
prehistoric open occupation site (Plate 2). The area is mostly level and cleared
on the low flood terrace (see Figure 2.14). Deep alluvial loam belonging to the
Atco soil series defines the sediment within which site deposition has occurred.
Tall grasses obscure the surface over approximately 80 percent of the surface
area; however, artifacts can be seen eroding out of the terrace edge between the
river bank and the park road, where surface vegetation is minimal.
Description
Site 41UV468 consists of scattered lithic debitage and burned rock that was
observed from the surface to a depth of 180 centimeters. Horizontally, the site
covers approximately 72,000 square meters of the flood terrace around 1,390
feet AMSL. Six backhoe trenches and six shovel tests were excavated within this
area, of which three trenches and two shovel tests were positive for cultural
material.
One burned rock accumulation (Feature 4) was identified at
approximately 50 to 60 centimeters below the surface extending from the west
wall of BHT10 (Figure 5.15). This feature consisted of a concentration of
approximately 13 limestone cobbles, many of which were fractured, six flakes
and an increased concentration of rabdotus shell from the surrounding matrix.
Limestone slabs within the feature were smooth and rounded and were initially
identified as possible metates.
A total of 27 flakes and 12 potentially heat fractured chert and limestone
fragments were recovered from subsurface testing at Site 41UV468. Artifacts,
including lithic debitage, one edge modified flake, and shattered burned rock
were observed on the surface and encountered to a maximum depth of 180
centimeters below the surface within three backhoe trenches and two shovel
tests. Eleven flakes were recovered from BHT 8 between 110 and 180
centimeters, with the majority of artifacts originating between 110 and 130
centimeters below the surface. Artifacts from the remaining positive trenches
and shovel tests, including a possible burned rock feature (Feature 4) were
recovered between 20 and 88 centimeters. A park road that parallels the edge
of the river and impacts related to clearing and maintaining the large open field
that contains the bulk of the buried deposits have disturbed the upper portions
of the site, but overall the site appears to be relatively undisturbed.
Investigators estimate the site to be approximately 80 percent intact.
Materials Collected/Observed
Thirty-nine lithic artifacts were collected from backhoe trenches and shovel tests
excavated at Site 41UV468. With the exception of a single edge modified flake
fragment and possible limestone hearthstones (N=6), all the collected material
was lithic debitage (N=26) or chert shatter/FCR (N=6). The debitage consisted of
secondary (N=2), tertiary (N=7), and broken flakes (N=17), most of which were
small in size and likely associated with biface thinning and core reduction. While
the sample is far too small to characterize the types of activities that have been
associated with the deposition of the artifacts, their general small size and
tertiary classification strongly suggest they are from the latter stages of tool
manufacture or refinishing.

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Discussion
Site 41UV468 was identified during the course of backhoe trenching on the flood
terrace of the Frio River. Due to dense grasses across much of the site, no
artifacts were visible on the surface except for along the site margin where
ground cover was sparse. Burned rock and minimal amounts of debitage were
observed eroding out of the edge of the terrace in this area. The presence of
burned rock and primarily tertiary flakes suggests late stage biface reduction
activity and at least ephemeral occupation of the area. Although the artifact
density was not as great, this is not dissimilar to the activity set evidenced at
Site 41UV73, which is located on the high terrace directly across the Frio River
from Site 41UV468.
The rapid alluvial deposition on Site 41UV468 presents a high potential for
additional buried features and preserved organic remains. Although the site is
currently not threatened by any proposed construction activity, it should be
routinely monitored by park employees to ensure site preservation. TPWD staff
will explore and implement the best means of site stabilization if features are
noted eroding from the terrace wall or general erosion worsens. The site is
recommended for SAL designation under Criteria 2 and 5, due to its location in
a high visibility portion of the park (along the eroded Frio River banks) along
with its overall high research potential. The risk of vandalism and relic collecting
is therefore very high and sufficient to warrant legal protection. Should future
development of the area occur, Site 41UV468 should be formally tested for
NRHP eligibility.
5.2.5

Site 41UV471
Setting
This burned rock midden and quarry site is located on a terrace, between two
unnamed Frio River tributary drainages (Plate 2). Site 41UV471 sits atop a
finger ridge composed of Real and Eckrant silty loam, with a prominent gravel
bar at the top of the terrace. This area is heavily wooded with cedar trees and a
variety of hardwoods along the western and southern periphery but generally
open near the site’s center. FM 1050’s right of way fence marks the site’s
northern boundary. Overall, depending on location, surface visibility varied
from zero to 100 percent.
Description
Site 41UV471 consists of a severely deflated burned rock midden and lithic
scatter overlooking a tributary drainage of the Frio River. The midden is
approximately three meters in diameter with a dark (black) powdery soil that
differs from the surrounding matrix. It is perched on the lip of a rock terrace
overlooking the creek channel to the west with burned rocks washing extensively
downhill (Figures 5.16 and 5.17). Artifacts were notably minimal adjacent to
the midden; however, approximately 15 meters east, the landform rises to the
upper terrace which is littered with tested cobbles and a variety of flakes at a
density of approximately 10 flakes per 3 square meters. This area corresponds
to a natural chert gravel bar that occupies the eastern half of the upper terrace
(Figure 5.18). Occasional pockets of increased debitage correspond to areas of
increased gravel deposits. Artifact density decreases with distance to the east
with only occasional flakes Site dimensions are approximately 240 meters east

Three shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of approximately 37
centimeters in the lower terrace and seven centimeters on the upland area with
no artifact recovery. No diagnostic artifacts were observed. The site has been
extensively impacted by sheet erosion on the southern and western periphery
with minimal impacts elsewhere. It is estimated that approximately 20 to 30
percent of Site 41UV471 remains intact.

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

Materials Collected/Observed
No materials were collected from site 41UV471 during the current
investigations. Archeologists observed a moderate to heavy amount of tested
cobbles, and lithic debitage consisting of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes
(Figure 5.19). One medial biface fragment was recovered from the surface of this
area, which was the only tool noted from Site 41UV471.

Figure 5.19: Typical artifacts observed on the ground surface at Site 41UV471.
Discussion
In the far northeastern corner of Garner State Park, Site 41UV471 sits atop a
narrow finger ridge between two ephemeral drainages. This location would have
afforded excellent resources for extended occupation during the prehistoric era.
The site, however, has been subjected to extensive natural impacts from sheet
erosion. Lacking diagnostics to further refine estimations of age, Site 41UV471
is attributed to the Archaic period. Very little of the midden is left intact with
only a broad, dark scatter discernable from the remaining natural chert cobbles
that are washing down toward the creek to the west. With such disturbance,
the perceived research potential of Site 41UV471 is minimal but it is
recommended for preservation with possible corrective action to minimize
further erosion. It is tucked away from park visitors but is sufficiently close to
two access roadways to warrant its protection under SAL Criterion 5. The site
should be routinely monitored for evidence of looting and corrective action taken
should such occur. Erosional impacts to the burned rock midden are too
extensive to warrant corrective action. Further management recommendations
are included for the site in Appendix A.

5.3

PREHISTORIC SITE DISCUSSION
A total of eleven prehistoric sites were investigated within the uplands and
lowlands of Garner State Park. The artifacts observed on these sites indicate a

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

68

Evidence of Prehistoric Occupation at Garner State Park

pattern of site function indicative of the landforms they occupy. In general, the
upland sites consist of early stage lithic production, a lack of features, and few
formal tools. The sites were likely temporary camps used to exploit game and
lithic resources outcropping from the local Devils Reef Limestone. The low
density of artifacts at these sites also suggests a short term occupation. Only
two diagnostic artifacts were identified in the uplands and both were on
41UV466. An Angostura point from the Late Paleoindian period (ca. 9,000 B.P.)
and an Edwards/Scallorn point from the Late Prehistoric (ca. 1,300 BP) were
both recovered from this site indicating a prolonged utilization of this region.
Contrasting the behavior exhibited in upland sites, the lowland sites are
characteristic of more long term settlement. This is evidenced by the presence of
burned rock middens, burned rock features, formal tools, and late stage lithic
production.
Two diagnostic artifacts, both Gower/Uvalde projectile point
fragments, were also found in the lowland areas within Site 41UV73. These
points date to the Early Archaic period (ca. 8,000 to 4,500 BP). The lowland
sites, which are subject to frequent flooding, have the highest potential to yield
intact, buried archeological deposits with good organic preservation.

EVIDENCE OF HISTORIC OCCUPATION AT
GARNER STATE PARK
By Mason Miller
Numerous sites and features attributed to the park’s historic occupation and its
construction were found during the course of the archeological survey
(Plates 2-4). Below is a discussion of the Garner State Park area’s historical
context and the findings made that can be directly attributed to it.

6.1

EARLY HISTORIC OCCUPATION
The Nueces Country and the Frio River Canyon area in which the modern
Garner State Park is found has been a very fruitful place for occupation in the
historic period as well as for prehistoric peoples. The historic period of
occupation in central Texas is marked by contact with European settlers and
explorers in the region who recorded the native inhabitants’ activities in the
written record (Collins 2004). Commonality of Caddoan ceramics (typical of
northeast Texas) in Toyah sites in central Texas confirms increased mobility of
Native American groups following food, escaping European camps and acquiring
additional territory (Perttula et al. 1995). The initial period of European contact
is sparingly documented, however, being located along a primary trade route
between Mexican Coahilla and San Antonio, Uvalde County was very frequently
visited and inhabited by European (particularly Spanish) travelers (Foster 1995).
While the main route to and from San Antonio passed southeast of the current
project area, there is little doubt that these people influenced native groups
living in the vicinity of what is now Garner State Park. Among the many Native
American groups known to have lived in the region during the historic period are
the Coahiltecans, the Lipan Apaches, and later the Comanches (Strong 1996;
Newcombe 1961). The influx of plains Indians, such as the Comanche, during
the early to mid-18th century pushed the Coahiltecans, decimated by European
disease, out of the region, leaving only the Lipan Apaches and Comanches as
well as later plains Apaches competing for this fruitful region well into the 19th
century.
Portuguese soldier Andres do Campo was likely the first European5 to pass
through the area sometime between 1542 and 1547 when he escaped from 10
months of captivity by plains Indian groups and traveled south, heading for
Eagle Pass. While additional Spanish explorers continued to occasionally pass
through the area in the following centuries (Fernando del Bosque. 1675; and
Alonso de Leon, 1689), missionaries were the first to attempt to establish
permanent settlements in the area. The closest such mission, Mission Nuestra
Señora de la Candelaria del Cañon was located on the Nueces near the present
town of Montell, west of Garner (Chipman 1992:177). None of the area’s
missions prospered due to a lack of support from the Spanish government,
minimal food and water, as well as disease outbreak and harassment from
neighboring Comanche. Native groups (namely Lipan Apaches) who lived under

Common interpretations state that Cabeza de Vaca was the first to pass through the region in the 1530s, however,
revised interpretations of his route (Hester 1999; Chipman 1992) place him traveling much farther south from
present day Rio Grande City to just west of Matagorda Bay.

the protection of these missions eventually abandoned them, leaving the priests
to fend for themselves.
In an effort to punish the deserters for leaving the missions, the Spanish
government appointed Juan de Ugalde to pursue and engage the Lipan Apache
in battle. During his 1790 action, Ugalde, with his complement of 600 to 700
Spanish cavalry, Comanches and settlers from San Antonio, first engaged the
Apache near Uvalde and pushed them northward into the canyonlands. Ugalde
encountered and destroyed three villages and fought the Apache warriors in
several battles, each time ending up the decisive victor. Ugalde’s engagements
in the region were so storied that his was later chosen as the namesake for the
City and County of Uvalde (Strong 1996; Chipman 1992).
Following this action, Indian control over the region progressively waned.
Spanish and later Mexican government officials began inviting Anglo-American
settlers to the area, which dramatically altered the historic landscape and the
lifeways of those who lived there.
No archeological sites in the park can be conclusively shown to date to this early
historic period of occupation in the region.

6.2

ANGLO-AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT OF
THE REGION
A slow trickle of European (particularly German) and American settlers reached
the fertile region by the 1850s and found it hostile and unforgiving. Land
prospectors, such as William Washington Arnett from San Antonio, were among
the first to purchase land within Uvalde County, focusing on prime locations
along the many creeks and rivers, likely including land that is now Garner State
Park. This land was shortly thereafter sold to later settlers who came to the area
for wild cattle and lumber (Ochoa 2008). Indian raids were a constant threat to
the settlers, who banded together for social as well as defensive purposes. At
this time Fort Inge, in nearby Uvalde, was known to be in a “continual state of
warfare” with Native American groups (Strong 1996). Immigrants came to the
area under a promise of abundant land and ranching and agricultural
opportunities. The canyons were the last to be settled as they were difficult to
reach, harsh, and generally considered the last refuge of hostile Indian parties.
Settlers most often lived in single or double-room log cabins, though occasional
stone structures were also built. Cattle, hogs, and goats were the primary
livestock of the region’s rocky uplands during the latter decades of the 19th
century while corn, tobacco and, to a nominal extent, cotton were farmed in the
lowlands during this time (Strong 1996:25). Sheep and goat raising was
particularly popular in the park region given the animals’ surer footing in rough
terrain and their browsing food habits. Goat and sheep ranching only increased
in popularity into the 1920s as mohair and wool produced on ranches such as
those along the Frio Canyon were routinely taken to Kerrville, Sabinal and
Uvalde and shipped to the East Coast of the United States where it was
particularly popular.
One archeological feature, a stone fence, was encountered during survey that is
likely associated with the formative ranching period of the Garner State Park
area.

6.2.1

“Old Stone Fence”
Setting
This dry-laid limestone cobble fence is found running generally northeastsouthwest along the southern ridge near the center of “Old Garner” within Site
41UV466’s boundaries (Plate 3, Figure 6.1). The fence is situated on the
relatively flat upper ridge terrace, extending from the southern park boundary
(extremely dense vegetation did not permit clear visibility beyond the boundary,
however the fence did appear to continue to the south) through the ridge saddle
to approximately 75 meters below the 1867-foot peak. The fence is limited to an
entirely upland setting with vegetation primarily consisting of interconnected
cedar motts, prickly-pear cactus and sparse upland grasses. Expanses of
exposed limestone and gravel deposits were encountered throughout the fence’s
length.

Figure 6.1: Historic stone fence
Description
The “Old Stone Fence” is constructed entirely of dry-stacked natural and/or very
roughly-hewn limestone blocks and cobbles. Within the park, the fence follows
a continuous 765-meter path from the southern park boundary to its gradual
terminus near the 1867-foot peak. Near its linear center, the fence is bisected
by the Bird and Bridges Trails with all stone removed from the dirt pathway.
The fence’s dimensions vary depending on location and degree of completeness
but in more intact areas, it stands approximately 70 to 90 centimeters tall with
a width of approximately 50 to 70 centimeters. The fence appears to be
constructed using two different techniques that alternate along its length. In
some areas, the fence is constructed by placing large, thin limestone blocks on
end at the outside fence edges and filling the center with smaller stones. Where

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

73

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

intact, flat stones are used as capstones. In other areas, the fence is entirely
composed of large, stacked blocks with no filler or capstones.
In general, the fence is considered 50 percent intact. In many areas the fence
has been either partially or completely knocked over with the blocks forming
loose piles along its length. It is unclear what has caused these impacts as it
could be any combination of erosion, vegetational intrusion (tree branches and
roots growing into and under the fenceline), climbing animals (both historicperiod livestock and undomesticated varieties), and park visitors (either
intentionally, or inadvertently by visitors climbing across to explore either side).
The fence is sturdy, but once compromised can easily be damaged further.
Discussion
The stone fence likely pre-dates the advent of barbed wire in the 1880s and
1890s (McKallum and Owens 2008); however it is difficult to discern who may
have built it as the land on which it stands was owned by the State of Texas well
into the 1920s (Strong 1996:30). Curiously, the fenceline does not match any of
the original survey or parcel boundaries in the area, and instead follows the
landform. If this example served as boundary marker, the landowners were
clearly occupying more than was rightfully theirs. Since landowners often
fenced into public lands, it is possible that the fence was built by Anthony
Blackmon, who was granted a patent to a significant portion of adjacent land
(immediately east of the parcel) from the State of Texas in October of 1874.
Louis Lee purchased the parcel from Mr. Blackmon in 1878. All subsequent
landowners purchased the land after the proliferation of barbed wire (Survey 11
in Strong 1996:Appendix D). The fence may have also been used for livestock
purposes, namely hogs and goats, which were the primary livestock of the region
during this period (Strong 1996:25). Given the extreme topographic setting, this
was more likely a goat fence than one for hogs, as hogs could not likely climb
into the higher landforms. The fence appears, however, too short for keeping
goats in place, and furthermore ends in open territory, gradually grading into
the hillside near the peak, essentially leaving it open to crossing near the peak
and thus practically useless. As such, its ultimate use remains unclear.
The fence may in fact be a CCC-related feature as well.
According to 1937
planning documents, the fenceline corresponds to a “Ridge Trail” that extends
southwest to an overlook (NPS and TSPB 935-1941:Sheet165). Given the
minimal deposition in this setting, the trail itself was not easily visible. If the
fence was constructed by the CCC, it may have served as a barrier to keep
visitors on the path. However, it is impossible to discern which may have come
first: the trail following an existing fenceline, or a fence that was built along a
trail.
Similar stone fences are common throughout the state and this example would
not likely contribute further to our understanding of their construction or use
(for examples of those observed by Hicks & Company archeologists see Jarvis
and Miller 2006; King 2005). While part of 41UV466, the fence alone should not
be listed as a SAL under Criteria 1-4, however, Criterion 5 may be viable given
the degree of rockfall and direct, frequent contact with park visitors.

6.3

THE MAGERS AND STREIB FAMILIES

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

74

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

The land upon which Garner State Park sits was entirely owned by two families
prior to its transfer to the State in 1935. Henry Streib and William and Effie
Magers were immigrants born in Germany in the 1850s, who purchased land at
what is now Garner State Park (Strong 1996:27, 29). The Streib and Magers
families, given their similar backgrounds and situation, became close friends
and remained so for many years to come.
In 1901, Magers purchased
approximately 1,270 acres of land that began east of the Frio and extended west
to occupy much of the southeastern portion of the park. While he raised sheep
and cattle and occasionally farmed in the open field west of the basketball
courts, the Magers generally did not use the Frio’s right (west) bank area as it
was too rough for his livestock. By the 1920s he did, however, often allow
campers (for a modest fee) to set up camp in this area. The campers would
arrive on the eastern side of the river and carry their gear across on foot (Strong
1996).
From 1907 to 1910, Henry and Dovie Streib purchased a total of approximately
1,400 acres of land in piecemeal fashion that included the western bend of the
original park and all of the expanded portions of the park to the north. The
Streibs built a house overlooking the Frio at the end of the dirt road depicted on
the USGS Magers Crossing Topo. Primarily focusing on raising sheep and cattle,
the Streibs also raised hogs, horses and occasionally cultivated portions of their
land. In 1928, Henry and his son Fritz purchased the large, 330-acre parcel
that occupies most of the center of the original park from the State of Texas, as
portions of this land were still under public ownership. To facilitate the
purchase, the Streibs borrowed an unspecified sum of money from their friends
the Magers. Henry’s son, Fritz, moved his family to the extreme northeast
corner of the original park boundary, building a house overlooking the river and
several outbuildings (Strong 1996). The locations of these structures are not
known from available maps of the time. A small well was dug on the river’s right
bank opposite the house site.
With the Great Depression sending wool and mohair prices and property values
plummeting, Fritz Streib, now working as a ranch foreman and construction
worker to make ends meet, was challenged to repay his debts to his friends the
Magers. Approached by the State in 1935 for a proposed state park, the Streibs
sold what is now the northern and western three-quarters of the original park
area for a total of $6,124 (Strong 1996:34-35). The Magers family, also
monetarily challenged by the Depression, sold the western outskirts of their land
to the State a year later for more than $3,000. This purchase tripled the park’s
available river frontage (Strong 1996:47-50) and brought the state’s available
parkland to 640 acres. With those purchases, design and construction began
on the historic Garner State Park.
No evidence of Fritz Streib’s house was encountered during survey of the
northeastern edge of the original park boundary, and dense fallen wood and leaf
matter (presumably from flooding) along the northern portion of the Frio’s right
bank hindered any potential of discovery of Streib’s well. One archeological site,
41UV349, can be tentatively linked to the Streib family, and potentially isolated
to the pre-park era.
6.3.1

Site 41UV475
Archeologists revisited the mapped location of Site 41UV349 during the course
of the archeological inventory (Plate 2). Described as an early 20th century
farmstead and house foundation, the site was recorded in 1993 during a survey

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

75

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

of the proposed new park road. Among the features recorded were cedar post
foundation remnants, a walkway that leads to a property fence, a toppled
chimney remnant and a small historic domestic sheet midden. The site is not a
listed SAL. The site was mapped on the 1960 USGS Magers Crossing quad at
the structure location within the northwestern survey extension. However, site
records place it 150 feet (50 meters) east of the then-proposed park entrance
road. Since the survey boundary for this investigation was entirely west of the
park entrance road that would place the foundation well east of the current
project area (Kegley 2001). Despite careful and thorough survey of the area on
two separate occasions, no elements of the site were found within the current
survey corridor that matched the site description. Since site recording data
stressed its likely preservation in a park environment, it is not likely that the site
has been destroyed. Indeed Diane Dismukes has visited a homestead site east
of the park entrance road that matches the description of Site 41UV349. Hicks
& Company archeologists did record a multi-component historic (early 20th
century) and prehistoric archeological site at the mapped site location that is
now listed as 41UV475. While the prehistoric component has been described in
the previous chapter, below is a description of the historic components
discovered at that location.
Setting
Site 41UV475 is situated east of US 83 and north of the original park boundary
on a slight upland terrace that overlooks the broad Frio River floodplain to the
east. Portions of the site descend into the lower landform near its eastern
terminus. A currently unused dirt road winds through the site area, essentially
bisecting the main portions of the site in an east-west direction while a cleared
telephone right-of-way (ROW) cuts northwest-southeast through the site area
along its eastern third (Figure 6.2). The site area is composed of equal parts
exposed limestone bedrock sheets (particularly in the southern third), short
ranch grasses and cactus (in the central and eastern portions), dense to
moderate cedar brakes (along the eastern and western periphery) and non-native
scrub plants in the eastern lowland areas. Surface visibility was generally
greater than 50 percent throughout the site area.

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Figure 6.2: General Site 41UV475 Area
Description
Occupying an area of approximately 21,600 square meters the additional
historic components of 41UV475 consist of a small (22 by 17-inch) concrete
slab, a large (seven by seven-foot) concrete slab, five vertically-buried 2.5-inch
steel pipes (four of which formed a approximately 10-foot square near the
southwestern site boundary; Figure 6.3) along with five cut pipe fragments
scattered throughout the site area, and two surficial trash scatters. Overall the
site is considered approximately 40 percent intact. Near the eastern periphery
of the mapped extension, archeologists noted a small decorative wire fence and
gate that met the dirt road along with a small cedar post picket fence (Figure
6.4). Embedded in the ground immediately west of the fence was a small pink
granite slab. Of particular interest, archeologists noted a partially exposed
possibly historic buried gas line near the site’s center (Figure 6.5) and two
rusted metal gauges (interpreted to be gas gauges) near the four-pipe possible
platform remnant. It is interesting to find a buried gas line at this site since
natural gas home heating did not gain widespread access until after World War
II (Lebanon 2008). All of the surficial scatters were extremely diffuse and were
noticeably devoid of typical domestic debris, instead containing ceramic (4-6
inch[?]) and metal pipe fragments (1-3 inch), machinery parts (including a
possible transmission near the northeastern site boundary) and undetermined
metal fragments, indicating a more industrial site use. The site area has been
used for storage of fencing materials and T-Posts in the recent past. Due to the
excellent surface visibility conditions at the site, archeologists excavated two
shovel tests during site investigations at 41UV475. These tests, MS17 and
MM22 were devoid of cultural materials within shallow upland soils and
bedrock.

Figure 6.5: Exposed Gas Line
Discussion
Archeologists are unsure of the true function of Site 41UV475. 1940 aerial
photography does indicate two to three structures once stood at this site
location with the largest found at the eastern end of the dirt road (beyond the
survey boundary). Aside from the galvanized steel pipes and the small cement
slabs, however, no structural elements were found within the survey corridor.
The historic components of Site 41UV475 are clearly 20th century in origin while
the prevalence of ceramic pipe fragments would further refine its age to the first
half of the century. Lacking temporal diagnostics, it is difficult to carry the
estimation any further. These outbuildings are likely associated with Fritz
Streib (Henry’s son) who undoubtedly moved to the northern parcels once he
sold his land and house to the state in 1935 (Strong 1996:35). There is one
interesting possibility though. According to Strong (1996:30), during the early
1920s Fritz Streib leased sizeable portions of his land to the Bexar Petroleum
Company in San Antonio for oil and gas exploration. The large number of
galvanized steel pipes and pipe cuttings, the four-pipe platform foundation, the
buried gas line, and the gauges could all be remnants of this enterprise. The
site lacks any evidence that would create a conclusive connection to this brief
enterprise and it is unclear why those structures would be extant in a 1940
aerial photograph; nonetheless the possibility exists.
Overall, Site 41UV475 is not considered significant and is too diffuse to warrant
any additional investigation beyond what has been completed. The site is set
well away from any park trail or access road, making it unlikely to be impacted
by park visitors. A telephone line that extends through the eastern third of the
site area does provide a means for the public to gain access to the site, however
the site materials within view would be very few and insignificant. Also the site
is generally devoid of evidence of erosion or other natural impact. As discussed
in Chapter 5, given evidence of possible looting of its prehistoric components,
this site is recommended for listing as a SAL under Criterion 5. Efforts should

be made to rectify the original 41UV349 find location and potentially
functionally connect these two components (if possible).

6.4

THE CCC, GARNER STATE PARK, AND CAMP GARNER
During the worst years of the Depression, more than half of the United States’
male population under the age of 25 was unemployed. Newly elected President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, making good on his campaign promise to create jobs,
signed into law the Emergency Conservation Act, which funded the Works
Progress Administration (WPA) and CCC (Freeman 2003:1).
Government
programs such as the CCC intended to create gainful employment for its citizens
by improving the nation’s infrastructure, increasing understanding of its
heritage, and developing recreational facilities. The CCC, overseen by the United
States Army, employed local young men in a variety of land and recreational
improvement projects from national and state parks such as Garner to forest
rehabilitation to cropland terracing (Strong 1996:32). The workers learned a
trade through on-the-job training while earning a modest income of $30 per
month (Strong 1996:38), which in turn helped feed the local economy.
Garner State Park was one of 56 state parks developed by the CCC in Texas
between 1933 and 1942. Uvalde County Judge C.P. Spangler, seeing the tourist
potential of the Frio River canyon area with its picturesque views, great
swimming, and close proximity to San Antonio, urged Vice President John
Nance Garner, a resident of Uvalde and Real Counties, to push for funding for a
CCC state park along the Frio. While initially cool to the idea, Garner warmed
when Fritz Streib, in an ingenious political move, suggested to Garner that the
park bear his name (Strong 1996:33-34). Political wheels turned at the State
and Federal level, applications for parks were filed (NPS 1935-1941:CON 172­
178), and by 1935, the United States Department of Interior National Parks
Service, announced that CCC Camp 879, then completing work at Indian Lodge
State Park at Fort Davis, Texas, would move to Garner. Immediately upon
purchase of the land, park designers began the planning process while
carpenters started construction at Camp Garner (Figure 6.6).
While independent of parks in the National Parks Service (NPS) system, the
Texas State Parks Board (now the TPWD) worked closely with NPS designers and
often collaborated and sought review and approval of plans and ideas during
development. Park planners tended to follow NPS design philosophies developed
following World War I which focused on “landscape preservation and
development that harmonized with nature (Freeman 2003:6).” Park elements
were meant to fulfill their function while enhancing the visitor’s natural
experience. Roads were to sweep across the natural terrain (rather than cut
through it) and provide grand views of the surroundings while bringing visitors
in. Trails were meant to be just visible enough to follow easily without
detracting from the natural setting. Native plants were placed to provide natural
screens of modern or intrusive park elements (like machinery, concession
buildings, etc.), while rock boulders were commonly used as barriers that were
obvious but inconspicuous at the same time. Park elements were often initially
planned and then made subject to repeated review and revision in a constant
effort to fulfill function while maintaining a natural setting (Freeman 2003: Table
2; NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Whole Volume).

Figure 6.6: Early Views of Garner State Park and Camp Garner
To complete the work at the park, local carpenters immediately descended on
the open meadow in the northern center of the original park and began
constructing Camp Garner. Ultimately comprised of 39 barracks to house the
CCC workers, officers’ quarters, bath houses, an infirmary, a kitchen and mess
hall, classrooms and a variety of garages, lumberyards, blacksmith shops and
sawmills (65 buildings total), the camp occupied a total area of approximately 12
acres. For recreation, the camp also had tennis and basketball courts and a
baseball field.
Immediately east of the camp area, CCC workers also
constructed stables that were to be used by equestrian park visitors. Beginning
on July 26, 1935 and continuing for the next six years of construction at the
park, this was CCC Camp 879’s home, recreation area, and classroom (Figure
6.7; Strong 1996).6 Once park construction was nearing completion in 1941,
the Texas Parks Board proposed leaving portions of the camp and its buildings
in place to be used as a group camp facility for groups like the Boy and Girl
Scouts, 4-H Clubs, the Future Farmers of America, etc. (letter Quinn to Diggs

The workers were popular with the local community, particularly the local girls. A CCC worker from construction
activities at a different park (near Stephenville), James Boggus, stated they “… always had a little money. The boys
in town didn’t have no money.” (Vetter 2000)

January 23, 1941 in NPS 1935-1941:CON 270), while others were to be used as
administrative buildings (letter Diggs to South Texas CCC District Commander
May 1, 1941 in NPS 1935-1941:CON 270), Ultimately the camp was abandoned
on May 1, 1941, and efforts were made to remove all trace of its existence
(Kegley 2001:15; Dismukes to Miller, Personal Communication 3/17/08).
During the course of survey, archeologists recorded two archeological sites and
one cultural feature that are likely related to the CCC Camp and its occupants.
6.4.1

41UV474
Setting
The remains of CCC Camp Garner are situated in an open grassy field at the
northern center of the original park boundary (Plate 2). This site overlaps the
newly-expanded boundaries of Site 41UV197 and only includes historic site
components. All prehistoric artifacts encountered within the site boundary are
considered part of Site 41UV197 (see Chapter 5). A park access road extends
through the site area from the southeast corner to the northwest corner.
Connected to this road is the current Garner State Park Visitor’s Center and
associated parking lot. Aerial photography was used as the primary means of
delineating site size once it was determined that elements of the camp were
extant (Plate 5). Sparse, large oaks and mesquites dot the area while dense
manicured grasses reduce surface visibility to zero percent.
Description
Archeologists focused intensive shovel testing and backhoe trench survey in the
area near the center of the original northern park boundary as this was the
likely location of the original CCC Camp Garner. The site is estimated to be
approximately 11 acres in size.
The primary physical representation of
41UV474 is exposed in Backhoe Trench 6 with additional artifacts unearthed in
nearby shovel tests and one backhoe trench. Within Trench 6, oddly-shaped
trench, archeologists unearthed three historic cultural features including a post

hole (Feature 1), a cement foundation for a wooden post (Feature 2), and a large
caliche deposit (Feature 3) buried between five and 48 cmbgs (Figure 6.8).
Feature 1 was a circular post hole exposed approximately four centimeters below
the surface, approximately 12 inches (40 cm) in diameter and approximately 43
centimeters deep that had been filled with small loose concrete chunks and
gravel. A small round finishing nail was found in sediments adjacent to the
feature. Approximately 250 centimeters (8 feet 3 inches) nearly due south, the
backhoe exposed the eastern half of a concrete post base measuring 12 by 18
inches and extending to a maximum depth of approximately 48 centimeters
(Feature 2). The negative mold of the original wooden post was visible on the
western interior of the cement chunk (Figure 6.8). Approximately six meters
west of Feature 2 was a large, amorphous caliche sheet that measured
approximately two meters long (E-W) and 1.5 meters wide (N-S) buried at
approximately 25 cmbs. No other features or historic artifacts were observed
within Trench 6, which reached bedrock in some portions at 50 centimeters.
In addition to Trench 6, archeologists excavated one other backhoe trench
(Trench 7) and five shovel tests within the mapped boundaries of Camp Garner.
None of the shovel tests or trenches excavated in the site area bore clear
indications of soil changes consistent with a camp. Instead, sediments were
generally uniform (10YR4/3 blocky clays and silty clay loams) through the upper
70 centimeters. While no other features were noted, Trench 7 contained a single
orange paste brick fragment and Shovel Test GS4 contained an asphalt shingle
(both at 40-50 cmbs). Outside of the 41UV474 area, within Site 41UV197,
additional shovel tests contained historic artifacts at a similar elevation
including a crown-type bottle cap (Shovel Test JC 1 at 40-50 cmbs) and charcoal
and cut bone fragments (likely non-prehistoric, potentially historic; Shovel Test
JC 3 at 40-43 cmbs). These peripheral historic finds could be related to the
camp, but are equally likely to be remnants of camping.
Discussion
Once Backhoe Trench 6, excavated in the apparent Camp Garner area,
contained historic features, the site boundary was delineated using georeference
1940 aerial photography (Plate 5). According to the photo, Backhoe Trench 6
was excavated in the vicinity of the northern-most barracks, specifically near
Barracks 2 (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 122; Figure 6.9). The two northsouth post holes/molds (Feature 1 and 2) likely held foundation piers for
Barracks 2 (potentially further refined to its western wall) with the caliche likely
representing the common area between it and its neighbor. Backhoe Trench 7,
which contained the brick fragment, was dug near the park’s technical quarters.
Finally, Shovel Test GS8, which contained the shingle fragment, was dug in the
southern outskirts of the park, adjacent to the CCC’s softball field.
Given the sparse camp remnants uncovered during this excavation, it is clear
that very little is left intact, however, Trench 6 confirms that some elements
have survived in situ. It is likely that the camp has been severely impacted by
its removal process but has since been largely preserved beneath the soil. While
additional investigations at the site would provide a more accurate
understanding of how severely the camp has been modified/removed, it can be
estimated from test data that 41UV474 is less than 20 percent intact. The site
is on a flat, open, grassy field and is not subject to erosion or significant grounddisturbing activities beyond what has already taken place. Given the site’s
direct association with a significant and unique period in the park’s and state’s

history, 41UV474 is considered eligible for SAL listing under Criterion 3 and
should be preserved in place. TPWD cultural resource specialists may wish to
create an interpretive addition to the park by denoting the camp’s approximate
outline on site using this survey’s GIS data as a reference. Accompanied with a
display describing Camp Garner and the CCC, the camp’s perimeter could be
enhanced with a small berm or the corners denoted with small concrete or stone
markers.
6.4.2

Site 41UV470
Setting
Archeologists noted an isolated historic trash dump that likely dates from the
1910s into the 1930s or 40s as well as occasional more recent deposits during
field survey. The site is found primarily within a low gully between two
prominent upland terraces with portions of the site deposits laying on the higher
landform at the western site edge (Plates 2 and 5, Figure 6.10). An abandoned
dirt road winds along the terrace edge from the southwest toward the northeast,
approximately 10 meters to the west of the western dump boundary. The site
area is sparsely vegetated with occasional, small cedar motts to the north and
west and yucca to the east.
Description
Site 41UV470 was primarily defined through the clear surficial distribution of
artifacts and two shovel tests (MM28-29). The site measures approximately 50
m east-west by 30 m north south and essentially fills the bottom and lower rim
of the western terminus of the gully (a total area of approximately 1,500 square
meters). The maximum depth of deposits was measured at the western
terminus (Shovel Test MM28) to a depth of 22 centimeters before contacting
limestone bedrock with Shovel Test MM 29 reaching only 8 centimeters before
terminating at bedrock. The trash deposits are profuse throughout the site area,
but appear to be clustered in three to four deposition events. According to
MM28 shovel test data, the northwesternmost cluster was likely also burned.
Materials Collected/Observed
The dump site was composed of typical historic trash including a variety of
metal, glass and ceramic artifacts. By far the most common artifact type of the
dump area was large, rusted metal cans, identified as either paint cans or large
food storage cans. Other metal artifacts identified included square gas or food
cans, car parts (including an early- to mid-20th century car door and body
fragment), three to four large, conical, perforated, tin pieces that have been
interpreted to be roof ventilation stacks, aluminum Texas Pride beer cans (likely
post-1960; BCCA 2008), as well as countless unidentifiable fragments.
Glass artifacts were equally strewn across the site area. Among the numerous
glass pieces were a variety of blue glass panel bottle bases and fragments. One
small cluster of manganese bleached clear bottle bases and fragments (preWorld War 1) was noted near the site’s western terminus. Additional glass
included clear and aqua soda bottles and bottle fragments including likely pickle
and ketchup bottles, ring pepper sauce/spice bottles and hobble-skirt Coca-Cola
bottles and fragments (likely dated 1923-1942), and a variety of brown glass
quart Clorox (dated 1929-1960, but likely 1930s) and bottle bases from Owens

Clorox 2006, Lockhart 2004). In addition, surveyors found numerous colored
glass shards throughout the site.

Figure 6.10: Site 41UV470 Map
Ceramics were generally the least numerous artifact type in the dump site,
though also potentially the most intriguing. While archeologists did encounter
two transfer-printed whiteware sherds (one in MM28 and one on the ground
surface near the western site terminus) and a single glazed coarse earthenware
ceramic sewer pipe fragment (inscribed with “W.S. DICKEY… MFG CO… SAN
ANTONIO…”), the overwhelming majority of ceramics were plain, institutional
whiteware. These ceramics were noted in two disparate groupings (one at the
western terminus and one near the eastern edge) that were very similar in count
and composition (Figures 6.11 and 6.12). Each cluster included one to two
large platters or serving dishes, one to two coffee mugs, a bowl, and, curiously, a

gravy boat. Where identifiable, the western whiteware cluster was entirely
composed of ceramics with “TEPCO – Vit. U.S.A. – CHINA” printed on the base.
The eastern cluster was likewise entirely composed of ceramics with the same
maker’s marks, though this time printed with “SHENANGO – NEW CASTLE, PA.
– ‘CHINA’ – U.S.Q.M.C. – W 431 ECW 73.”

Discussion
Given the variety of artifact types as well as the somewhat broad range of
datable artifacts (bleached glass fragments, aluminum beer cans, bottle and
ceramic typologies) it is likely that this dump site was used repeatedly over
several decades. While impossible to conclusively link to the storied CCC, this
dump site does hold some tantalizing indications to that effect, the most
important and telling of which, lies in the ceramics discovered.
Whiteware fragments observed in the site were very plain and identical–looking
(institutional) despite being made by two different manufacturers. TEPCO is
registered to the Technical Porcelain and Chinaware Company, which made
institutional and restaurant dinnerware beginning in 1922 (Lehner 1988:468­
469). Shenango is listed as a large ceramic manufacturer that began business
in 1901 and was known for its institutional and hotel ware production
particularly during the 1920s and 1930s and beyond (Lehner 1988:419-427;
Bagdade 1994:141-143).
What is most intriguing is the inclusion of
“U.S.Q.M.C.” on the Shenango pieces. These are the initials of the United States
Quartermaster Corps which oversaw the U.S. Army’s provisioning. This is the
same group that in all likelihood provided the CCC with their supplies. While
textual sources could not assign a specific date to the Shenango mark, a scan of
a variety of online auction and collectibles sites with similarly-marked listings
have been dated by the sellers to the 1930s and 1940s with those of the 1940s
including a date on the maker’s mark - something missing from these examples.
According to James Boggus, a CCC worker on the original Garner State Park in
Stephenville, each mess hall table was set with a complement of necessary bowls
and plates and food was delivered to each table on large serving dishes,
potentially like those observed (Vetter 2000:49). It is unlikely that a single
family would have more than one identical large serving dish and gravy boat and
more unlikely that they would throw two away at essentially the same dump
site.
While not within the original park boundary, Site 41UV470 is fairly close to the
CCC camp and is easily accessible off a dirt road (Plate 5). The dump could
have been used by the CCC even as a one-time dump location. Though it is
certain that not all of the dump site can be attributed to the CCC, there are
enough converging lines of evidence to place a very strong likelihood that at least
portions of this dump site were left by them. If this is the case, the artifacts left
therein represent a very rare assemblage of CCC material culture at Camp
Garner. As such Site 41UV470 is eligible for listing as a SAL under Criterion 3.
The site is tucked well away from any park visitors and, while perched on the
edge of and within a drainage gully, does not appear to have suffered from
erosional damage. The site is considered 75 percent intact and should be
preserved in place through avoidance.
For interpretive purposes, park
personnel may wish to remove some of the better, and more complete whiteware
examples and include them in a CCC-related park display (should such be
developed).
6.4.3

The Old Park Treeline
During investigations at the CCC camp, archeologists noted a straight line of 20
mature mesquite trees that extended from the second park entrance road, east
to the dense woods just east of the current park entrance road (trees are visible

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

90

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

on Figure 1.1 immediately south of the large parking loop and depicted on
Plates 2 and 3). The treeline matches the northern boundary of the original
park and likely is the result of seed germination from bird droppings as they
perched along the old park fenceline. It is important to note, however, that
aerial photography from 1940 (Plate 5), as well as other photographs of the
period do not show a treeline at this location. While these trees were not likely
present at the time of CCC occupation, this treeline serves as a visual
representation of “Old Garner” where the CCC Camp stood. The densest trees of
the line are found along the eastern side of the original camp area in what was
the recreational area and the proposed stables (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet
122). The woods beyond the park entrance road were too dense to continue
isolating the treeline but it is likely that the trees continue for some distance as
1940 aerial photography shows the area clear of woods (Plate 5). The trees
should be preserved and highlighted for park visitors, but are not considered
directly associated with the camp. As such they are not recommended for SAL
listing.

6.5

EARLY PARK CONSTRUCTION PHASE (1935-1936)
During the first phases of construction at Garner (1935-1936), work focused on
improving access to the park through construction of the park’s roads (primarily
the 2 ¼-mile main park entrance road), culverts, and overlooks. With heavy
rains and steep slopes, road construction was paramount to continued practical
work at the park, as without them trucks were being noted as unable to exit
(NPS 1935-1941:CON 369). As NPS Inspector B.A. Tripp stated, “It strikes me
that a surface binder should be applied as early as possible to lay the dust and
to prevent rutting due to heavy washing on the steep slopes. Once these roads
start going to pieces it will be a costly operation to put [back] into shape (NPS
1935-1941:CON 15).” Part of the road construction included, Garner’s original
and impressive entrance portal. Work at Garner during the first two years also
included installing facilities such as foot and bridle trails, the Keeper’s Lodge
and the Service Court. Finally, work began on the Combination Building.
Several elements of this earliest phase of construction were encountered during
the course of archeological survey including culverts, overlooks and the original
park road, which was re-routed very early in the design and construction
process (Plate 4).
6.5.1

Site 41UV467
Setting
This historic road remnant and accompanying historic scatter is located near
the park’s original access gate and connects the original access road to the
park’s western fenceline at roughly a 45 degree angle (Plate 3). The site is
nestled beneath a moderate to dense cedar stand on the gradual northwarddescending hillslope immediately north of the original park entrance road. The
ground surface is largely obscured by cedar tree litter and blown leaves,
affording approximately 30 to 50 percent surface visibility. Two shovel tests
excavated during site investigations (BJ6 and 7) reached less than 15
centimeters in depth through 10YR4/2 clay loams with neither containing
buried components.

Description
The primary component of 41UV467 is an abandoned roadway that begins at
the park’s western boundary, approximately 160 meters northeast of the original
park entrance portal and extends approximately 45 meters southeast where it
merges with the original park entrance road (Figure 6.13). The site occupies a
total area of approximately 900 square meters. The roadway is a single track,
approximately five to seven meters wide and sunken slightly below grade.
Historic debris is scattered both within and north of the abandoned roadway.
The two main artifact scatters are found approximately 20 to 25 meters west of
the old park road and five meters north of the abandoned dirt roadway, with
each covering an approximate three- by five-meter area. The eastern scatter was
primarily composed of undetermined machinery and car parts (10 pieces of
undetermined iron and steel rusted machinery, a fan belt, a possible brake pad
fitting, etc.), a sterno can, several standard tin cans, a clear bottle glass base, a
green glass vessel, and a variety of plastic fragments. The western scatter was
composed of numerous (more than 20) glazed stoneware flowerpot sherds, a
brown ‘Duraglass’ bottle base, and additional tin can fragments. The flowerpot
sherds are glazed duff on the exterior and brown on the interior with a variety of
fragment sizes. All of the sherds were found in close association and were likely
the result of a broken vessel being thrown into the woods from the roadway.
Occasional rusted metal fragments and brown bottle glass were scattered within
the roadway with notable examples including an older Pearl Beer bottle and an
‘Owens Illinois’-marked brown bottle with a production date of 1962.

Figure 6.13: Historic Road of 41UV467.
Near the site’s eastern terminus immediately south of the possible road,
archeologists also noted a conspicuous, tabular, dark gray limestone block that
was large and angular enough to likely be culturally modified. The block was

92

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

fractured medially but measured approximately 39 inches by 22 inches by 6
inches thick (100 by 56 by 15 cm; Figure 6.14).
The site has been impacted by minor erosion, particularly north of the dirt road,
in the vicinity of the historic artifact scatters. The Wild Horse Creek Trail bisects
the site near its western terminus while occasional modern pieces of trash
indicate some park visitors have frequented the area or trash has blown in from
US 83. Generally, dense vegetation and cedar leaf litter have obscured the road
from view from the old park road leaving the dirt roadway relatively intact
(greater than 60 percent) while the accompanying historic scatters are estimated
to be 40 to 50 percent intact.

Figure 6.14: Limestone Slab found in 41UV467
Discussion
According to available sources, diagnostic glass fragments from 41UV467 can be
dated from 1940 (the year the Duraglass name was introduced; Lockhart 2004)
through the early 1960s (1962 was date stamped on the Owens Illinois bottle
base). The remaining historic artifacts are likely of similar or later vintage and
generally unremarkable. Given their close proximity to the old park entrance
road and US 83, it is very likely that the artifacts observed are the result of

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

93

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

occasional refuse dumping by passers-by. As a result, this component of
41UV467 is not considered particularly significant.
What may be of more interest historically is the road itself and the large
limestone block found adjacent to it. CCC Master Plan documents from the
early park planning process do indicate that the park entrance location was
revised with an earlier entrance connecting to US 83 farther north than the
ultimate entrance location (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 32). The September
1936 document depicts the “Present Entrance” at the same location and
orientation as 41UV467 (including a representation of a drainage culvert
immediately southeast of the junction with the revised park road, as was seen in
the field; Figure 6.15). While an undated (but likely contemporary) inspector’s
memo from the NPS recommends “revision of the entrance” (NPS 1935­
1941:CON 337), is unclear whether this road was in place well before
construction began at the park; however, a February 1937 entrance road plan
indicates a “Wagon Road” at the site’s location (TPWD 1937:Sheet 26;
Figure 6.16). Since CCC workers generally used trucks for supplies, this likely
means, that the road potentially predates the CCC’s activities (Vetter 2000).
However, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the roadway
component of 41UV467’s significance lies in its use as the original entrance road
to the park.

Figure 6.15: 1935 Planning Drawing of Existing (right) and Revised (left) Park Entrances.
As described above, the large limestone slab measured 39 by 22 by 6 inches and
appeared to be clearly a cultural artifact. Archeologists noted that the slab
looked similar to the park road’s drainage culvert. These dimensions are nearly
identical to the lintel stones of the original park road’s stone culverts (measured
at 39 by 27 by 6 inches with comparable engineering dimensions in CCC
planning documents; NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 37). Given the stone’s
close proximity to the drainage culverts and it’s nearly identical dimension, this
artifact is very likely a broken culvert lintel block.

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Figure 6.16: Wagon Road on 1937 Road Planning Schematic.
The extraneous minor historic trash scatters aside, 41UV467 is likely a direct
remnant of CCC construction activities at the park, including the original park
entrance and drainage culvert construction. While it is impossible to assign a
date of origin for the road, it was in use in September of 1936. The site does not
appear to be subject to significant natural or artificial impacts and is in
generally good condition. Beyond data gathered through this survey, this site
does not meet any of the formal SAL criteria and as such is not recommended
for that designation.
6.5.2

Minor Drainage Culverts
Archeologists recorded a total of seven small stone culverts along the park’s
original main access road from the entrance to the “Y” at the combination
building (Plate 4). Connected by a drainage ditch which ran along the length of
the uphill side of the park access road, the culverts facilitated drainage beneath
the access road from a capped inlet on the uphill side of the road to a drainage
core outlet on the downhill side along a 2 by 3-foot, stone and white mortarlined subsurface drain (Figures 6.17-6.19). The drain was often built to the
natural grade face prior to road construction, then extended to meet the artificial
grade following the road’s completion. While each varied somewhat from one to
the other, Culvert 1 was typical of the series and consisted of a rectangular,
open, stone inlet covered with a large 44 by 31 by 9-inch solid limestone cap.
The culvert’s outlet measured 39 by 23-inches with a 6-inch-thick lintel stone
(like that observed in 41UV467). It is unclear when these smaller culverts were
constructed, however, culvert designs that are similar to those found in the park
are depicted on planning diagrams as early as June of 1935 (NPS and TSPB
1935-1941:Sheet 37). Construction on the subterranean portions likely closely
followed these early plans. All visible portions of the culverts were likely
completed after road construction to minimize damage and allow for variations
in final grade. As can be seen in a 1936 design, planners include details on
extending culverts to meet the final hillside grade following road placement (NPS
and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 36). Finalizing these culverts continued for several
years as a 1938 inspection recommends that Culvert 7 at the “Y” needed to be
extended and that the job would likely be completed by April 15th of that year

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

(NPS 1935-1941:CON 16). All culverts were in generally good to excellent
condition with no readily apparent structural problems, though many
(particularly lower on the hillside) could benefit from leaf and debris clearing at
the inlets to allow for better water flow and easier visibility by visitors. These
features should be preserved and are recommended for listing as SALs under
Criteria 3 and 5.

6.5.3

Major Drainage Culverts
Archeologists briefly recorded two larger drainage culverts (one that crosses the
main park road at Javelin(a) Hollow and one at the Wild Horse Creek Hiking
Trail in the northern portion of the original park; Plate 4, Figure 6.20). The
Javelina Hollow culvert was recorded due to its location well below the existing
grade in a dense cedar thicket and some indication of wear. Its western
headwall was very large with an inlet size of approximately four feet tall by six
feet wide.
The shaped limestone face contained small stone courses
(approximately 8 inches tall) near the base and larger ones (up to 14 inches tall)
near the top. Aside from a buildup of modern trash and some colluvial
deposition on the inlet’s flagstone, the culvert is in excellent condition and does
not bear any indication of structural problems that may need to be addressed.
The eastern headwall is even more substantial (too inaccessible to take
measurements), and grades into a small, steep stone retaining wall along the
southern face of Javelina Hollow. This face and the attached retaining wall are
in somewhat worse condition. Some of the blocks of the eastern (outlet)
headwall and particularly the retaining wall appear to be missing mortar with
rocks clearly loosening and falling away. The construction timeline for this
larger culvert was likely similar to that of the numerous minor culverts along the
main park road.
The Wildhorse Creek crossing culvert is located within the Shady Meadows
camping area, running east-west beneath the “trailer road” near Camping Areas
118 and 119 (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 19). This culvert is prominent in
the area but was recorded due to some indications of wear that will likely need
attention to prevent further damage. The culvert, like the one at Javelina
Hollow, is constructed of shaped limestone blocks and white smooth-paste
mortar. At the western (inlet) headwall, the culvert is approximately six feet
wide with a channel opening that is approximately 26 inches high and five feet
wide. Given its greater width, the center of the channel has been supported by a
single course of limestone, in effect creating two separate culvert channels. To

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

97

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

add support, two, six-inch-wide iron bars extend across the full channel opening
width, immediately below the lintel stones. The stair-stepped parapet has a
maximum height of approximately 44 inches. The eastern (outlet) headwall is
comparable in dimension and shape but is curved in plan to allow room for a
large tree and curvature in the road. It appears that the tree adjacent to the
outlet is crowding the culvert as the mortar is cracked and missing on portions
of the face and the metal support bars appear to be buckling under the lateral
pressure (Figure 6.21). Construction on this culvert likely began sometime
between late July of 1938 (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 19), when culvert
designs for the trailer road were drafted, and late August of that year when
construction on the road began (NPS 1935-1941:CON 18).

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Figure 6.21: Eastern Headwall of trailer road culvert.
The larger stone culverts within Garner bear clear indications of adherence to
the Post-World War I design philosophies of the NPS. Surveyors noted the rocks
were horizontally oriented, weathered smooth with no fresh breaks visible on the
outer face, and were irregularly spaced (no four stone joints met). This created a
more harmonious design aesthetic with the natural setting which was preferred
by the park planners of the time (Freeman 2003:Table 2). These culverts should
be preserved and stabilized to prevent further deterioration.
They are
recommended for SAL listing under Criteria 3 and 5.
6.5.4

Overlooks
Archeologists briefly documented the two less prominent overlooks (Overlooks 1
and 2) along the original park entrance road (Plate 4). Since this road is no
longer used by vehicular traffic, the overlooks have fallen into a degree of
disrepair and are being overgrown. Each overlook measured approximately 30
feet across and extended 20 feet off the road. Each had a paved terrace surface
that has now become partially overgrown with grass and a natural limestone
boulder face. Overlook 1, the western-most, is generally open with a jumble of
picnic tables and a concrete slab in its center that presumably once was the
base of a telescope. Surveyors noted a set of six natural limestone block steps
descending the western corner of the overlook to a natural terrace below
(Figure 6.22). While somewhat overgrown, the view from Overlook 1 was more­
or-less intact, open and framed by vegetation, though modern park construction
in the expanded portions of the park have compromised the setting and feeling.
Overlook 2, the middle overlook, has fallen into disuse and has become
completely screened by dense cedar growth (Figure 6.23). No stairs were noted
descending the edge of Overlook 2.

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Overlooks such as this were considered essential to the park planners of the
day. They provided temporary parking and rest areas while giving park visitors
a spectacular panoramic view. Park planners often used overlooks such as this
to give entering park visitors a progressively grand series of views (almost like
view tale being told) as they progressed farther and farther into the natural
environment, with each overlook providing several “principal views” (Freeman
2003). Each overlook was designed and positioned to best frame a series of two
to four “principal views” of the surrounding area. To keep the visitor oriented, a
principal view target of a former outlook was reacquired at its succeeding
overlook (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941: Sheet 28; Figure 6.24). While Overlooks 1
and 2 both faced the valley and Camp Garner to the north and west, Overlook 2
was lower on the hillslope and likely provided a more detailed picture of the
valley to the west and a new view of the Frio River to the east. The increasingly
grand overlook views then culminated at Overlook 3 (still in use in its original
roadside context), which faced east over the Frio River, the steep hillsides and
the open country to the east.
According to available planning documents, the stairs observed on Overlook 1
descended to a “Rock Garden” a very short distance below the overlook
(Figure 6.25). These stairs adhere to the NPS design guidelines of the time, as
they appear to be natural ledges, not introduced rock steps (Freeman
2003:Table 2). It is unclear where the target rock garden is as the trail abruptly
became indistinguishable at the dense lower vegetation. From planning
drawings the garden may well be the cluster of large limestone boulders that lie
at the base of the overlook (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 27). It is unclear
when construction on the overlooks began or concluded, however, they most
likely immediately followed the main park road’s construction, which was an
early phase construction project. Overlook design documents, dated to late
1936 and early 1937, would indicate that construction was underway around
the beginning of 1937 and likely completed some undetermined time thereafter
(potentially by that summer; NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheets 26-28).
Due to the original park road’s decommissioning to vehicular traffic, Overlooks 1
and 2 have naturally fallen into disuse. While no longer being used as parking
areas, they should still provide visitors with the views park planners initially
intended. If efforts are made to enhance a visitor’s historic experience at
Garner, overlooks should be cleared to allow for easy views to the surrounding
landscape. The “Rock Garden” trail should also be enhanced (if present) and
with trailhead access made more prominent. The picnic tables and the cement
telescope pad (likely post-dating initial construction) should likewise be
removed. Beyond being overgrown, the overlooks are in generally good condition
and do not require further preservative attention.
The overlooks are
recommended for listing as SALs under Criteria 3 and 5.
6.5.5

Caliche Pit
Within Site 41UV197’s extension, archeologists noted an open pit measuring
approximately 40 meters across that was somewhat recently used as a dumping
ground for old cement picnic tables. Inspection of the tables indicates that these
do not match tables designed by park planners and installed by the CCC and
are more likely later forms similar to those observed on the left bank of the Frio
and within a small park dumpsite in the extreme southwest corner of the park.
This open pit is only depicted twice in planning correspondence. A late 1940
diagram of the northern park area and the CCC Camp depicts a caliche pit at

this location with work roads leading to its southern edge. A February 1941
landscaping memo from the NPS recommended (among other items) that all
work roads leading to the caliche pit should be removed, broken up, and
resodded. It is unclear from this documentation when this pit was created as
numerous earlier representations of the area do not include it however, this
could just as likely have been an omission as later documents also do not
include it. Dug into a gravel bar terrace, the caliche pit likely provided trail and
road materials for park construction. Since roads were essential to park
construction, it is likely that this pit was in use from the beginning. The pit is
not recommended for SAL listing due to its nominal contribution to park history
and its impacts from recent dumping.

6.6

MIDDLE PARK CONSTRUCTION PHASE (1937-1939)
During the middle phase of construction (1937-1939), most of the roads were
completed or were fast on their way to being so. The major buildings in the park
like the Keeper’s Lodge and Service Court were completed and the Combination
Building was continuing with construction. Work focused more on enhancing
the camping experience and campers’ facilities. The overnight cabins began
construction during this period as well the picnic and camp grounds, cooking
units, the park’s sewage system, and additional trails. Park planners also
listened to visitors in their preparation of their designs at this time. From the
moment construction began, Garner was open to the public and visitors’
opinions and recommendations were often included in planning correspondence
(NPS 1935-1941:CON 352, 372).

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

103

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Archeologists documented several features within the park that date to this
period including elements of the sewer system, the water storage tank, and the
now abandoned Bluff/River Walk.
6.6.1

Wastewater Elements
Archeologists documented two minor components of the park’s original sewage
disposal system including one brick and mortar manhole along the Madrone
Trail and a short segment of ceramic sewer line pipe within Backhoe Trench 3
(Plate 4). The sewer line manhole measures approximately three feet in outside
diameter and stands approximately 18 to 24 inches above grade. Above the
ground surface, archeologists noted five offset courses of radially-laid red brick
with a dense, white plaster/cement mortar. The manhole’s opening is curiously
small (at approximately two feet in diameter), by our estimations too small to
climb down into; however, at least one iron bar step was visible above the dirt,
rock and trash that now fills the center (Figures 6.26 and 6.27). The manhole
was generally considered to be in moderate to good condition with the upper
courses suffering from degradation from exposure to the elements and likely
park visitor traffic. The center was filled with occasional pieces of trash and
limestone cobbles. While only one such manhole was noted during the survey,
according to contemporary design plans, several manholes such as these were
located within the park. Each led an unspecified distance down to a six-inch
vitrified ceramic sewer line pipe which began at the Keeper’s Lodge, proceeded
southeast to the Combination Building and on to the cabin area and eventually
to a septic tank (not located during the survey) which then fed a short distance
to a disposal field buried beneath the open grassy field west of the basketball
courts (Figure 6.28). The disposal field is described as a series of eight buried
parallel sewer pipes that are dry-butted together to allow sewage to slowly seep
out at the seams into the surrounding soil matrix, where it is absorbed (Personal
Communication Dismukes to Justen 4/30/08). The pipes met at a central
“distribution box” (four pipes per side; not located during survey) that had

removable baffles to close off certain pipes to allow them to “rest” and open
others for use. Archeologists recorded one brown, octagonal vitreous ceramic
pipe segment near the disposal field area within Backhoe Trench 3. The short
pipe segment was running east-west at a depth of approximately 117
centimeters (46 inches) below the ground surface. While the closest sewage
system depicted on CCC planning documents is the disposal field described
above, this system was oriented north-south. In addition, this is deeper than
the prescribed depth in CCC planning documentation (2-3 feet; NPS and TSPB

1935-1941:Sheet 68). No park structures were planned in the vicinity that
could have connected to the disposal system. It is unclear what this sewer pipe
might have connected to however, the pipe was found to be in good condition,
photographed (Figure 6.29) and reburied in situ.

Figure 6.29: Buried sewer line in Backhoe Trench 3.
Construction of the sewage disposal field, was one of the middle-period projects
undertaken by the CCC, following construction of the camp and the park roads.
With construction of the cabins, combination building, and keeper’s lodge under
way, park planners needed a means to dispose of the sewage that would be
produced.
Contemporary documents do not provide a specific start or
completion date or cost for the sewer system and disposal field construction
however, an inspection report from late February or March of 1938(?)7 states
that the sewer system was well under way with “all but 900 feet of excavation
complete…” and that six of the eight disposal field lines were complete. The
report estimated a completion date of April 15, 1938 (NPS 1935-1941:CON 16).
It is likely that all sewer system components (with the exception of the cabin
area connection lines which were completed a year later; March 3, 1939
Inspection Record in NPS 1935-1941:CON 30) were in place by this April 15th
estimate date, including the manhole documented near the Madrone Trail and
the sewer disposal field. The CCC manhole should be preserved in place and
highlighted for park visitors. It is recommended for SAL listing under Criteria 3
and 5. Too little of the remaining sewer system was observed to warrant
preservation or SAL listing recommendations.

The record does not include a year, however, several neighboring documents in the archival volume are dated to
1938, indicating that this record is likely also of that year. Furthermore, the CCC design plans for the disposal field
and septic tank are dated to December 20 of 1937.

Water Supply
Approximately 40 meters west of Overlook 3, perched on the hillside, surveyors
located two square cement manholes, loosely covered with iron lids (Figure
6.30). The manholes were approximately eight meters apart and in moderate to
poor condition. When lifted, the covers revealed that sediment had been
introduced inside to the present grade. This site matches the planned location
of an 11,000-gallon water storage tank (Figure 6.31). Made of iron-reinforced
concrete and dug eight feet into the hillside, the tank was split into two 11 by 9­
foot chambers with an inlet and outlet pipe at opposite end. Perched on the hill
as it was, the water was initially pumped from a well near the northeast corner
of the park. At the higher elevation, the tank not only provided water storage,
but also sufficient water pressure to supply the various structures and water
fountains. While no planning correspondence was available that pin-pointed the
date of construction, planning schematics date from August of 1937.
Construction on the facility likely followed shortly thereafter.

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

A more recent storage tank was found immediately west of and above the CCC
water tank. This tank had round manholes and covers and was somewhat
larger than the original tank. This feature is not considered significant to the
park’s history. The CCC tank is in a state of moderate to high disrepair. Should
TPWD wish to highlight CCC features such as this for park visitors, it should be
restored (at least at its exposed surfaces). Given its association with the CCC it
is recommended for SAL listing under Criterion 3.
A survey of the northeast corner of the park did not reveal a conclusive location
for the original CCC well site, however, a concrete slab and large water(?) line
(both appearing of more recent construction) at the approximate well site could
be all that remains (Figure 6.32).

Figure 6.32: Modern Water (?) Well Site near northeast corner of original park boundary.
With utility maps in hand, subsurface testing intentionally avoided all known
CCC-related water, sewer, and electric lines, however, one water line was
accidentally encountered during survey. A single waterline was unearthed 35
centimeters below the surface within Backhoe Trench 1 near the southeasternmost corner of the park. Running approximately northwest-southeast, the line
corresponds to a buried waterline that served the picnic areas along the river. It
is unclear when construction on this waterline began or terminated, but the
earliest representations of it are dated to August of 1939 (NPS and TSPB 1935­
1941:Sheet 45). Construction likely followed some time shortly thereafter.
6.6.3

Bluff/River Walk
Just off the southeast corner of Overlook 3, archeologists noted a series of five
limestone stairs, obscured by piled up brush, which led down the hill to a lower
riverfront bluff. Extending south, behind the keeper’s lodge and service area
and terminating at the northern edge of Javelina Hollow (a total distance of 160
meters), was a mortared limestone and cedar fence that followed the outer edge

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

108

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

of the bluff (Figure 6.33). At Javelina Hollow, the fenceline abruptly stops with
no indication of the suspension bridge that is described in early design
documents (see below). A chainlink fence constructed around the south side of
the service area blocked access to the Javelina Hollow area, so more detailed
investigation in this area was not possible. Whenever this chain-link fence is
removed, additional investigation is recommended. Fenceposts were large and
tapered, approximately three feet tall and two feet wide, and composed of
overlapping, narrow limestone blocks with recessed mortar. Suspended between
each fencepost were two parallel cedar log rails. A barely perceptible trail was
also noted following along the inside of the fenceline. While some fence
segments were missing the cedar rails, the fence was generally in very good to
excellent condition. Replacing missing cedar segments would be preferred if the
park ever plans on reusing this trail, however, due to safety concerns if this trail
is to remain off limits, it is well hidden and not easily accessed and as such will
not likely require additional attention beyond avoidance.

Figure 6.33: Mortared Stone and Cedar Fence

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

This trail, known as the Bluff Walk or River Walk, was intended to connect
Overlook 3 with the Combination Building to the south, passing behind the
recently completed Keeper’s Lodge and Service Bay.8 The route followed the
picturesque Frio River’s steep bluff overlook along a gravel and sand pathway
(NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 149). Scattered along the trail were portable
wooden picnic tables and bench combinations to rest and eat at (NPS and TSPB
1935-1941:Sheet 44). The walk was initially proposed to span Javelina Hollow
at a suspension bridge then proceed south along the current extent of the
Madrone Trail, eventually meeting up at the dance terrace. A landscape plan
dated June 8, 1937 (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941: Sheet 147) includes fence
design drawings and recommendations for placement as well as a description of
the path fill (Figure 6.34). It is likely that construction of the Bluff/River Walk
commenced shortly thereafter with the intention of installing the suspension
bridge at some point as well. Several early representations of the Bluff/River
Walk from 1936 and 1937 include this proposed suspension bridge (NPS and
TSPB 1935-1941: Sheets 2, 4, 147, 185; Figure 6.35), however, no actual
construction plans for it are known.
Furthermore, 1939 and 1940
representations of the trail do not include a suspension bridge and instead
depict the Bluff Trail turning sharply to the south and following the west bank of
Javelina Hollow to the road, where it crosses, then joins what is now the
Madrone Trail (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheets 38, 44, 50; Figure 6.36). It is
likely that conditions on site or economic constraints halted construction of the
proposed suspension bridge. Ultimately the trail was altered to make its
connection by the existing park access road bridge. At this location, surveyors
recorded four steps rising up to the Madrone Trail that likely are the only
remnants of the connection with the Bluff/River Walk.

Figure 6.34: Planners’ representation of the Bluff/River Walk fence
The walk’s fenceposts were very similar in form and composition to those
observed at the original park entrance portal. While park design philosophy at
the time preferred that park elements used a variety of forms and materials in
an effort to blend in with a more natural feeling (Freeman 2003:Table 2), this
may have been done to create a design continuity across the park (NPS and
TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 7A). The stonework was in line with the preferred NPS
guidelines with weathered stone facing the exterior, thin, horizontal blocks, and
generally deep set mortar seams with no four joints meeting (Freeman
2003:Table 2).

8

There is some confusion regarding the actual name of the trail as many representations do not include an actual
name. Early maps that do name the trail call it the “River Walk” (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941: Sheet 149) however
later representations put that trail at the base of the bluff and refer to a “Bluff Walk” nearby along what is now the
Madrone Trail (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941: Sheet 44). As such the trail is referred to by both names.

The fenceline is a significant element of the park’s history and a symbol of the
craftsmen who built it. It should be preserved in place. If it is to be highlighted
in the future the fenceline should be restored and the chain-link fence removed.
It is recommended for SAL listing under Criteria 3 and 5.

6.7

FINAL PARK CONSTRUCTION PHASE (1940-1941)
During the final phase of park construction (1940-1941) CCC work focused on
finalizing the camp experience for its visitors and refining and fine-tuning the
park facilities. Among the many projects undertaken during this phase were the
addition of five more cabins (bringing the total to 14), design and installation of
most of the park signs, planting and landscaping, eradication of hazardous
plants, fire-hazard clearing, utilities placement, and flood and erosion problem
reduction. The Combination Building (increased in size to include employees’
facilities) was also brought to completion during this period (Strong 1996; NPS
1935-1941:CON 118-123). Finally, in the last months (March of 1941), workers
commenced obliterating as much evidence of their work as possible, namely
digging up and resodding construction roads and trails as well as portions of
Camp Garner itself (NPS 1935-1941:CON 123, 127).
Several features associated with this last phase of park construction were also
encountered during survey including elements of the park’s water supply well,
check dams and the group barbecue pit.
6.7.1

Check Dams
In an effort to control apparently significant erosional problems along the park’s
minor tributaries, CCC workers built a series of 20 check dams. Twelve dams
were placed along the northern creek tributary, west of the Shady Meadows
camping area and eight were placed in the channel southwest of the cabin area
(NPS 1935-1941:CON 415-416). The dams were made of any combination of
earth and/or limestone rock and rip-rap (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 132)
and intended to slow down fast-moving water flowing from higher elevations to
reduce erosion within the channel and lower on the landform. According to CCC
planning documents the dams were to be more than 30 feet long and ramped
toward the center to a maximum height of two feet. As needed, the dams were
to be cut into the channel sides and lined with limestone rip-rap (Figure 6.37).
As a testament to the powerful waterflow in these areas, archeologists followed
these channels with the specific intent of locating the check dams and were only
able to document three examples, all in very poor (almost non-existent)
condition (Plate 4). All check dams were found within the northern channel
with none encountered within the much steeper (and presumably higher-energy)
southern channel. The western-most dam still spanned the full width of the
channel but the center had largely been knocked away. All that remained of the
others were the rip-rap channel walls that had been cut into the sides
(Figure 6.38). All the dams that were relocated are considered to be in poor
condition and any further preservative efforts on them should be accompanied
with significant increase in dam strength and retention efforts (such as recessed
cement mortaring). The check dams were completed in April of 1941 at an
outlay of 876 man-days (NPS 1941:CON 415-416).

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

A curious, loose jumble of similar-sized limestone cobbles measuring
approximately 15 meters in diameter was noted on a flat terrace approximately
60 meters southwest of the located check dams. Initially considered of natural
origin, the stones were too centralized and too uniform to not be cultural.
Archeologists noted that the rocks in the jumble were of similar size and
composition to those observed in the more intact check dam and made a
tentative connection between the two. While there is no record of such a rip-rap
sheet in any CCC documentation, it is postulated that this may have served as a
staging area during construction of the dams with the stones dumped at this
central location and brought by hand to each dam site. According to the April
1941 Job Completion record, the northern channel’s check dams required some
180 loads of rock, and those loads likely would have been brought to a central
location to facilitate distribution (NPS 1935-1941:CON 415-416). This jumble is
considered to be largely intact with no indication of intrusion or disturbance.
Overall the check dams and rock jumble are too diffuse and disturbed to
warrant preservative efforts and are not recommended for SAL listing.
6.7.2

Well Site
Approximately 20 meters northeast of (and 10 meters directly below) Overlook 3,
archeologists documented a series of four vertical cedar posts descending
downhill to a small intermediary terrace overlooking the Frio River to the east
(Plate 4). Perched on the narrow terrace is a six by six-foot tiered square
cement slab standing approximately 20 inches above grade with a second,
smaller slab on a second terrace approximately six feet lower and to the east
(Figure 6.39). Next to the upper slab is a single vertical cedar post with,
curiously, 15-20 nails hammered into its top (Figure 6.40). The area is littered
with a variety of trash items from people discarding refuse over the edge of the
overlook. The path down to the slabs from the overlook is too steep and densely
vegetated to be accessible and only slightly easier to traverse from the shoreline
below, making it essentially inaccessible to the average park visitor.

Figure 6.39: Cement Slab along lower bluff below Overlook 3

114

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Figure 6.40: Cedar post with numerous nails driven into its top.
This accumulation of cedar posts and concrete slabs is likely the remnants of
the CCC’s park well (specifically well caps) and water pump (NPS 1935­
1941:CON 87-94; NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 56; Figure 6.41). The CCC
proposed one of two well locations to service the Keeper’s Lodge, the
Combination Building and the camping areas. One proposed well location was
near the current chlorinating facility just south of the Frio’s junction with the
northern tributary (Figure 2.18). This initial site was selected as it was lower
on the landform and would be cheaper and easier to dig, however, the National
Parks Service determined that this site would be prone to inflow from surface
water during floods and would thus be less sanitary. The reinforced concrete
well had a four-foot internal diameter and was dug to 25.4 feet below the Armysupplied three horsepower electric Hi-Lift pump. To sanitize the incoming water,
the CCC workers installed a Wallace & Tierman Co. Chlorine driver.
Surrounding the well, pump, and chlorinator was a nine by nine-foot pump
house made of yellow pine which is no longer extant (NPS and TSPB 1935­
1941:Sheet 52). It is unclear what purpose the lower cement platform/slab may
have served, but correspondence between the National Parks Service Geologist
and the parks inspector John Diggs regarding the well location included the
recommendation to place the well “preferably near the site where the engine for
the Army pump, recently installed, is located (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941: CON
78).” This secondary pad may have been that pump engine site, as an Army
pump is noted on a design plan for the well site (NPS and TSPB 1935­
1941:Sheet 53). The vertical cedar posts observed may have supported steps to
the pump, acted as a guide for the three-inch galvanized steel pipe that ran
uphill and connected to the 11,000-gallon storage tank above Overlook 3
(described above), or guided electric lines to feed the pump and chlorinator. A
CCC-built telephone line dating to early 1941 extended through the area from
the combination building to Camp Garner that used 20-foot-tall cedar posts,
however, according to planning documents the line’s location is higher on the
hillside than the poles found and the poles are too close together to be

telephone-related (NPS and TSPB 1935-1941:Sheet 48). Construction on the
well, pump, chlorinator and pumphouse was completed in February of 1941,
near the end of the CCC’s occupation at Camp Garner, at an outlay of 794 mandays and $1,048.24 (NPS 1935-1941:CON 85). This feature is too non-descript
and destroyed to warrant SAL status. It should be avoided but does not warrant
significant preservation efforts.
6.7.3

Barbecue Pit
Near the western end of Shady Meadows camping area, then a trailer camping
area, archeologists recorded a single large barbecue pit that was built by CCC
workers in the later stages of park construction (Plate 4, Figure 6.42). While
not measured in the field, planning documents indicate the pit’s interior was
approximately 10.5-feet long and three feet wide and was approximately four feet
tall (approximately 15 inches being below grade; NPS and TSPB 1935­
1941:Sheet 11A; Figure 6.43). To keep with the design aesthetic, CCC workers
lined the pit’s exterior with native stone, dry-laying the first two feet and
mortaring the remainder (Job 185 Completion Record in NPS 1935-1941:CON
357). The pit was ‘U’-shaped with an opening at one end and topped with two
large iron grates (stacked next to the pit). Some of the lining stones are missing
and some of the interior mortar is cracking, but the pit is considered to be stable
and in generally good condition. The pit should be highlighted and preserved.
Since it represents a unique period in Texas history and is in close proximity to
park visitors, it is recommended for listing as a SAL under Criteria 3 and 5.

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Figure 6.42: CCC Barbecue Pit in Shady Meadows area

Figure 6.43: Planners’ Schematic of Barbecue Pit
In the Fall of 1940, Garner management requested two such pits (one at this
pit’s location and one closer to the Combination Building; NPS 1935-1941:CON
351-353), however the National Parks Service approved only one be built (NPS
1935-1941:CON 356). In the original job application, the CCC noted that they
planned to use “… an old barbecue pit which has been used by the general
public for many years and by the camp for four years… We propose to rebuild
this old pit, making it available to the continued public use (NPS 1935­
1941:CON 352).” The pit was said to be situated at the foot of the mountain, on
the edge of the meadow. The National Parks service stated that the proposed pit
location was not necessarily a good one and recommended considering another
location. It is unclear if this recommendation was followed as a northern picnic
area plan that post-dates the NPS response tentatively places a barbecue pit
(250 meters) southeast of the actual pit’s location (NPS and TSPB 1935­
1941:Sheet 44).
Both the mapped and actual pit generally match the

117

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

contemporary textual location description. If the mapped barbecue pit is the
revised location, CCC workers might have returned to the original pit’s location,
however, the job completion record indicates that the pit was likely completely
new construction. If the latter is the actual occurrence, the “old barbecue pit”
was not located during the course of survey. Whatever the case, the job was
completed in October of 1940 at an outlay of 562 man-days and $10.16 (Job
185 Completion Record in NPS 1935-1941:CON 357).

6.8

UNDETERMINED CCC-RELATED FEATURES
Several features that are likely (or potentially) CCC-related were also
documented throughout the park for which a specific (or even approximate) date
cannot be conclusively derived. These include two limestone retaining walls, the
upland trail benches, and the cedar lantern posts in the Shady Meadows
camping area.
6.8.1

Retaining Walls
Forming the western edge of Campsite 119 in the Shady Meadows camping area,
archeologists noted a single, isolated stone retaining wall that has created space
for the campsite’s picnic table (Figure 6.44). Forming a 90-degree angle, the
feature consists of mortared, natural limestone blocks forming one 15-foot long
north-south and one 15-foot long east-west wall. The wall is cut into the
relatively steep westward rising hillslope that marks the boundary of the
camping area. The walls are approximately 18 inches thick with a maximum
height of 39 inches at the northeast corner and are stair-stepped south and west
to match the existing grade. The wall is in excellent condition with no apparent
structural problems noted. The wall appears very similar in design and
composition to the nearby culvert that likely dates to the summer of 1938 and
may have been constructed with surplus rock following its completion.

Figure 6.44: Retaining Wall in Shady Meadows Area

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

118

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

Near the park’s paddleboat ramp, immediately adjacent to the Frio river
channel, surveyors recorded a second retaining wall that extends along the right
riverbank over a distance of 140 meters. Consisting of large, tabular limestone
slabs set on end along a concrete base, the wall likely is used as an erosional
control feature. Though this wall looks comparable in form and workmanship to
defined CCC structures, this feature is not represented in any of the CCC
archival documentation and therefore may be a later addition to the park,
potentially following a period of severe beach erosion. The wall is in generally
good condition with no apparent structural problems noted. The feature should
be listed as a SAL under Criteria 3 and 5.
6.8.2

Cedar Lantern Posts
Within the Shady Meadows camping area, surveyors noted a component to camp
sites that was unique to the whole park and could be of particular interest to
future park planners who want to focus attention on the park’s historic aspects.
At campsites 105-119 and 124-132, lantern posts are single cedar posts
standing approximately six feet tall with bent steel rebar driven through the top,
forming two lantern hooks (Figure 6.45). Throughout the rest of the park,
lantern hooks are much more modern, made of curved, galvanized steel pipes
with a bent nail welded to the end. A thorough examination of CCC planning
documents and drawings was fruitless in finding a representation of the cedar
lantern posts, however, they were well weathered and could date to this period.
Archeologists found these posts to be in generally moderate to good condition,
providing a ‘nice historic touch’ to the campsites. The surveyors expressed an
interest in seeing more of them in the other historic campgrounds (such as
Pecan Grove and Oakmont). While the posts at Shady Meadows should be
preserved in place, if future development plans call for replacement of the steel
posts and hooks, it is recommended that considerations be made to replace
them with similar cedar posts to enhance the historic ‘feel’ of the campgrounds.

6.8.3

Upland Trail Benches
During investigation of the park’s upland ridgeline, archeologists recorded two
dry-laid stone benches at strategic points next to the hiking trail (Plate 4,
Figure 6.46). The benches are composed of a single large, rough, unshaped
limestone slab resting atop two smaller dry-laid stacks of limestone. The
benches did not match any of the design aesthetics observed throughout the
rest of the park and were thought, following recording of the second site, to be a
product of later park development. Subsequent to survey, investigators noted
Julie Strong’s (1996:57-58) interpretation that the benches indeed were likely
made by the CCC during the later phases of park construction, to occupy
workers during periods of down time. Given the preponderance of planning
documents and job applications and approvals, it is difficult to agree that these
benches were constructed without some form of prior approval. In fact a 1936
memo from NPS Inspector Thomas Thompson outright states, “It is not a custom
of the Inspector to authorize work on unapproved jobs except in emergency
cases (NPS 1935-1941:CON 369).” That being said, archival records available to
this researcher are incomplete and approvals may have been given that are now
missing. Ms. Strong delved much deeper into the park’s history and may well be
correct in her hypothesis. The benches are generally intact but are falling into
disrepair. TPWD should consider restorative efforts to reduce potential damage
from use.

6.8.4

Caves
During initial planning for the park, NPS designers noted three caves along the
park’s upland areas that could have served as points of interest for hikers.
These caves: White Rock Cave, Crystal Cave and “Dos Equis” Cave, were noted
on master plan documents and, in Crystal Cave’s case, slated for entrance
clearing to allow easier access to its interior (Figure 6.47). It is unclear when
this work was completed, however, from Figure 6.47, it is evident that the trails
were already in place, so clearing could have been conducted during the latter
stages of park development.

Figure 6.47: National Parks Service representation of Crystal Cave Prior to entrance clearing.
Dos Equis Cave was found to be a very small, nearly vertical slit in the northern
face of the park’s highest peak. Once several feet below the ground surface, the
cave does open up but is clearly not practically accessible, particularly for the
average park visitor. The cavern received its name from the “XX” painted on its
face (Figure 6.48). Approximately 10 to 20 meters south (and uphill) from the
cave entrance was a similarly-painted sign for the entrance on a limestone rock
face with “50’ ↓” added (Figure 6.49). According to Ranger Frank Roberts
(pictured in Figure 6.48), these were reportedly painted by the CCC, however,
inspection indicates that the paint is in too good of condition to be attributed to
this era. It is possible that the signs have simply been overpainted.

ADDITIONAL FINDS AND FEATURES
Several isolated finds and features were also documented that can not be
attributed to the more significant periods of the park’s history.
In Backhoe Trench 1, archeologists recorded the remnants of an old campfire in
the upper 10 centimeters of sediments (Plate 3). Intermixed within the ashy
deposits were a variety of recent-historic artifacts including (among other items)
green bottle glass, aluminum foil, pull tabs, and plastic.
With the

122

Evidence of Historic Occupation at Garner State Par

preponderance of more recent artifacts (namely plastic) within the soil column,
this camp fire is not likely very old, potentially dating to the 1970s.
Several shovel tests were excavated in the open field south of the cabin area
(north of Backhoe Trench 1) that contained a variety of camp-related modern to
recent-historic trash and debris (Plate 3).
Some items, however, are
noteworthy. Along with a large variety of other modern items, a single mirror
shard was recovered from 40-50 centimeters within Shovel Test BJ14, along the
base of the steep hillside to the west. The mirror could be a remnant of the
CCC’s proposed “Women’s Toilet” which stood near this location (NPS and TSPB
1935-1941:Sheet 4). Given that the same shovel test also contained plastic
grass and a twist tie from a similar elevation, it is more likely that this shard is a
modern remnant, but it’s find location is intriguing. At the same elevation range
(40-50 centimeters) within Shovel Test GS19, archeologists recovered a metal
medallion. The piece depicted a stylized sun with a bird on the front and
"GLORIA EN ESPIRITU SANTO" engraved on the back. The Catholic medallion
was probably dropped by a park visitor.
Near the northern end of the northwestern survey extension, archeologists
recovered a single brown bennington glaze stoneware body sherd in the upper
10 centimeters of Shovel Test MM24 (Plate 2).
No other artifacts were
encountered within the test nor were any encountered within any of the
additional shovel tests dug immediately adjacent to the find area. This find is
well away from any documented structures or dump sites and is likely the result
of a random depositional episode.
Three modern or recent park dump sites were noted during the course of survey
(Plate 3). While the first is within the CCC caliche pit described above, the
remaining two sites are located at the extreme southwest corner of the park at
the base of the hill. All three sites were strewn with concrete picnic tables
(different from those designed by the CCC - which had benches on all four sides
of the table - but rather a later form) and undetermined chunks of concrete,
while the two at the southwest end also contained barbecue pits and discarded
trash cans along with a diffuse scatter of other materials. None of the sites were
considered significant to the park’s historic makeup and are merely noted for
reference.
Archeologists recorded an abundance of similar park benches standing in place
on the small eastern bank area within the original park boundary (Plate 3).
Each picnic table was found to be intact and composed of reinforced concrete
with two benches and a single large table. Supports for the table were tapered
along their side. Archeologists noted and marked a total of 25 of these benches,
which were part of a planned day-use area that was eventually abandoned
(Dismukes to Miller, Personal Communication; Figure 6.50). Within this area,
surveyors noted two buried water lines with hose bibs in place along with a
modern hunting blind.
In the northeastern survey extension, near Backhoe Trench 18, surveyors noted
an unusual grouping of seven cedar posts, sawn smooth approximately one-foot
above the ground surface (Plate 2). The grouping formed a rectangular shape
approximately 10 feet long and four feet wide (Figure 6.51). Approximately 20
meters south of the odd post collection was a standing cedar post corral with
wire fencing. The corral was in generally good condition and did not appear to
be of significant age (maybe 1950-1960s). A small jumble of bricks, were strewn

between the corral and the post area along with a small scatter of recent historic
metal and plastic trash. The features observed are likely agricultural remnants
from the Streibs’ later occupation on the property and were not considered
significant or worthy of site designation.

CONCLUSIONS
By Mason Miller and John Campbell
The archeological survey of 830 acres within Garner State Park revealed a
diverse physiographic and cultural landscape. The breadth of the survey,
encompassing upland and lowland environments, enabled the investigators to
paint a picture of prehistoric and historic settlement within the park area. The
span of human occupation in the park encompasses almost 10,000 years from
the early prehistoric aboriginals, to early ranching, to CCC construction and the
present day park. All of these episodes of human occupation are present within
the current park boundaries and these resources are all characteristic of the
environs that they occupy. The process for identifying these resources was
established within the research design that outlined a systematic approach of
intensive survey to include pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and deep
trenching. The intensive survey utilized a total of 146 shovel tests and 19
backhoe trenches and identified and reinvestigated 14 prehistoric and historic
archeological sites.
Eleven prehistoric sites were investigated within the uplands and lowlands of
Garner State Park (Table 7.1). These sites are characterized as lithic scatters,
burned rock scatters, and burned rock middens. As expected sites in the
uplands are all ephemeral low density lithic scatters with few formal tools and a
focus on primarily early stage lithic reduction. These upland sites have poor
integrity and lack features or organic preservation, due to the absence of soil
and severe erosion. The sites were likely temporary camps used to exploit game
and lithic resources. The low density of artifacts at these sites also suggests
short term occupation.
The lowland sites contrast this pattern and are
characteristic of more long term habitation. This is evidenced by the presence of
burned rock middens, burned rock features, formal tools, and late stage lithic
production. The lowland sites, which are subject to frequent flooding, have the
highest potential to yield intact, buried archeological deposits with good organic
preservation.
Evidence of historic occupation at Garner, and the work of the CCC in
particular, was found to be especially rich during the course of survey.
Archeologists encountered seven archeological sites within the park boundaries
that bore historic components ranging from the 19th century through to fairly
recent park visitors. Many of these sites can be attributed to specific people or
families or, in the case of the historic dump site and CCC Camp Garner, a very
unique phase in the state’s history. While many of the CCC’s creations are
prominent within the park (such as the Keeper’s Lodge and Combination
Building), other, more subtle additions are equally storied. Through archival
investigation, many such minor features were isolated to specific construction
phases and can provide visitors with a timeline of park construction.
With such a valued and well-visited state park as Garner, there is still a great
deal more that can be offered to the average park visitor. It is hoped that some
of the information developed and provided in this report can go a long way
toward providing TPWD with knowledge of the precious cultural resources it
stewards while developing new avenues for learning and participation during
visits to the Frio River Valley.

APPENDIX A
GARNER STATE PARK CULTURAL RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT PLAN

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY FOR ARCHEOLOGICAL
RESOURCES WITHIN GARNER STATE PARK
By Mason Miller
Hicks & Company’s Spring 2008 archeological survey of approximately 830 acres of Garner
State Park has afforded cultural resource management personnel at Texas Parks and Wildlife
(TPWD) with a great deal more information on management, protection and preservation of the
previously unknown historic and prehistoric archeological sites in the park. During the course
of the survey, archeologists were able to access approximately 56 percent of the park, newlyrecording ten archeological sites (41UV466-475), revisiting five previously documented site
locations (41UV9, 33, 73, 197, and 349) and briefly mapping and recording 28 CCC-related
landscape features. The mapped location of Site 41UV349 was found to be inaccurate, but a
seemingly unrelated multi-component site at that location was recorded as Site 41UV475. Site
41UV449 was targeted for additional investigation but does not extend within the park
boundaries. Sites documented during the survey span nearly the full spectrum of human
occupation in the area from the Late Paleoindian through the recent historic.
This survey has resulted in a much more comprehensive view of the cultural landscape of
much of the park, including the entirety of the original park’s 640 acres and 190 acres of
additional park land. The resulting data set will assist the TPWD with new and directly
relevant interpretive and educational materials for park visitors, a better understanding of site
location and conditions for protection and preservation, and a representation of areas of high
and low archeological sensitivity for future development planning.
This section will summarize the legal requirements for cultural resource management within
state lands and define management recommendations for each site and landscape feature
recorded within the survey area. These recommendations do not extend to the approximately
580 acres of land that were outside of the survey boundaries.

LEGAL GUIDELINES
According to the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resource
Code of 1977, as amended; TAC), the State of Texas is mandated to locate and protect all
archeological sites that are found on lands owned by the State or any political subdivision
thereof (hereafter referred to as ‘state land’). State parks, such as Garner, are state land and
must adhere to the rules and guidelines of this mandate. It is TPWD’s responsibility to identify
and record archeological sites that are located within land it controls and to maintain those
sites that are found. Often inventories of archeological sites on state land are completed in a
reactive manner, in response to proposed future development (such as state highway
expansions or the construction of a public school), however, proactive inventories such as that
conducted at Garner are occasionally utilized as well and often provide the public with greater
understanding of the overall cultural landscape while providing greater flexibility in future
development.
According to the TAC, any archeological site that exists on state land is considered a state
archeological landmark (SAL), making it eligible for formal designation as such. Site locations
and content are not considered public information and are not subject to the Open Records
Act, making their protection and preservation more manageable, however SAL status assists in
this process. With this designation, SALs indicate sites that have a high research value and
carry increased penalty for looting and vandalism. The Texas Historical Commission (THC), the
State of Texas’ State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), has the ultimate authority to
designate SALs following nomination. To be formally designated, SALs must meet at least one

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-1

of the five criteria shown below (from Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code
of Texas, Chapter 26, Section 26.8):
1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the
prehistory and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important
information;
2) the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservations interests of
the site;
3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory
and/or history
4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could
occur and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal
protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the
effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.
Vandalizing or digging in SALs without a state antiquities permit is considered a criminal act
and punishable by a fine of $50-1000, 30 days in jail or both (Antiquities Code of Texas,
Section 191.171). Archeological sites in state parks receive further protection, with
unauthorized damage resulting in a fine of up to $500 (Texas State Park Rules, Section
59.134dd).
With the findings made during this inventory and with future research goals in mind, TPWD
has a tremendous opportunity to provide for thorough protection of the cultural resources it
stewards and can use the below site-specific recommendations to further the effectiveness of
this process.

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY INVENTORY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION
Funds were available to investigate approximately 830 acres of Garner State Park’s full 1,419­
acre extent. The 830-acre survey tract was selected for survey for four main reasons: 1) the
area was the most historically significant and had densest accumulation of CCC-related
features and structures for investigation; 2) the area housed numerous recorded significant
archeological sites that needed to be reassessed; 3) the area was situated in a high probability
area that had not been previously (or only minimally) surveyed, and/or; 4) the area was
situated in a lower probability area and could be fully inventoried quickly. The survey
produced a nearly comprehensive inventory of all historic and prehistoric archeological sites
within investigated areas of Garner. Within the uplands and intermediate areas of the original
park boundary and along the full northwestern survey extension, archeologists successfully
traversed all viable portions of the landform and consider the segment fully inventoried. The
northeastern survey extension was fully traversed and extensively subsurface investigated. All
cultural resources in that portion of the park are likewise considered identified and fully
inventoried. Finally, within Old Garner’s floodplain (see Chapter 3), archeologists made drastic
strides toward a full investigation of cultural resources and consider the region’s inventory
largely complete, however, in rare instances of particularly expansive impacts, additional
investigation is recommended.
Cultural resource managers should not consider all areas of the park covered by this survey
cleared for all future construction. Several significant archeological sites have been recorded or
reassessed as a result of investigation. TPWD cultural resource managers will need to take
into account effects of construction to the sites discussed in this volume and will need to

consider more intensive site investigations, should such a site be impacted by park
development or maintenance.
Additionally, due to the intensity of development and extent of subsurface utilities in Old
Garner’s floodplain, investigators could not fully assess deep-soil contexts through all of the
deep sediment contexts. Since trenches were regularly excavated to the maximum reach of the
backhoe without contacting bedrock or another indication of likely sterile soils, there is the
potential that more-deeply buried archeological sites and materials could be preserved beneath
the development zone and the maximum depth of investigation. Away from site contexts,
shallow impacts in the park’s floodplain will not likely affect significant buried cultural
resources, as historic and modern artifacts were regularly encountered at depths of up to 50
centimeters, however, deep construction activities in Garner’s floodplain should be preceded
with intensive mechanical survey to the maximum depth of impact to fully assess potential for
site preservation.
While the areas investigated during the 2008 survey are considered well inventoried and
documented, whenever funding is available, a similar archeological inventory is strongly
recommended for all portions of the park not covered during the course of this investigation.
Particular attention should be paid to the park’s floodplain and riverfront terrace, which has
proven to be particularly rich in sites and site preservation but is also the most intensively
utilized by park visitors. As part of this investigation, surveyors should reassess the extent
and composition of all known archeological sites in the area. After many years of exposure to
the elements and park activities as well as a limitation of previous investigations to clearancerelated survey areas, known sites, site components and boundaries within park areas not
studied in the 2008 survey may be larger and/or more significant than originally thought. Two
sites located beyond this survey’s study area (41UV197 and 41UV73) were found to be just
that. It is likely that additional sites or site components may be recorded through this
additional investigation.
In addition to the above recommendations, please refer to the site-specific recommendations in
the following section.

MANAGEMENT OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES AT GARNER STATE
PARK
A total of 14 archeological sites and 28 historic CCC-related landmark features were identified
and recorded during the course of survey of approximately 830 acres of Garner State Park
including its original 1935 boundary and two extended survey areas (Table A-1). Funding was
not available to fully inventory the park’s full 1419-acre tract, however one archeological site
was expanded into the surveyor’s camp area, illustrating the necessity of further investigation.
Additional investigation within unsurveyed portions of the park as well as additional,
supplemental, CCC-context specific investigations in the original park area, are recommended.
Park-Wide Management Recommendations for Archeological Sites.
Archeological sites in Garner State Park are quite numerous and widespread with many in
frequent, direct contact with park visitors. It is important that all park visitors be made aware
of the significance of archeological sites in parks and the penalties carried therein for
vandalizing them. Notices of penalties and fines should be made prominent on brochures, field
maps, and potentially receipts. It is recommended that unless specifically stated otherwise, all
sites be monitored at least biennially for evidence of vandalism or damage from park visitation
or maintenance activities.

Site-Specific Recommendations
Below is a brief summary of each of the sites and features visited and a definition of each site’s
SAL status/recommendation as well as its management priority. Discussion will begin with
site discussions in order by trinomial, followed by isolated landscape features. For ease of
discussion of a site’s research potential and management priority, TPWD has developed an
incremental scale for site management that is defined below:






Management Priority 1: Officially designated SALs that retain a high
degree of integrity and research potential;
Management Priority 2:
Sites that are recommended for SAL
designation due to their research potential;
Management Priority 3: Sites that are recommended for SAL status
due to potential for destruction from vandalism or erosion, regardless
of research potential
Management Priority 4: Officially designated SALs that have a low
research potential, however warrant additional preservation efforts;
and,
Management Priority 5: Sites that are not recommended for SAL
status but should be protected.

41UV9 – Listed SAL – Management Priority 1 & 3 – 60 % Intact
This prehistoric burned rock midden site covers an area of approximately 200 square meters,
abruptly ending at a gravel bar to the south, the Frio River to the west and an access road to
the north. As observed, the site is primarily subject to looting and pedestrian traffic. As such
this is listed as a SAL likely under Criterion 5. Additionally, Criteria 1 and 2 also apply.
Even during its initial recording by Thomas Hester, the site was noted to have been heavily
surface hunted and looted. During this survey’s site revisit, looter’s holes were likewise noted
in abundance - some appearing to be relatively recent. The site has been bisected along its
western edge by a dirt road, while a barbed-wire fence (marking the park’s original northeast
corner) is placed through the midden’s center. Additionally, a picnic table is located
immediately southwest. No diagnostics were noted within shovel tests or through surface
inspection so temporal definition is limited to likely the Middle to Late Archaic. Cultural
deposits extend from the ground surface to a depth of 90 centimeters with a possible buried
feature encountered at approximately 30 centimeters. Research potential for the site lies in its
potential for midden formation studies in unlooted areas (there are several) as well as an
indication of intact preservation below the ground surface along the midden’s southern talus.
It is clear that the site has been and continues to be frequented by looters, with looting being
the primary impact to site integrity. The site does not bear indication of significant disturbance
from erosion. The site area is overgrown enough that it is generally not a destination of park
visitors and devoid enough of surface diagnostics and tools that the occasional park visitor may
not notice the site for what it is. If future park use warrants the expansion of accessibility to
this area, additional mitigative measures may be required that are beyond the scope of this
study. However, the following steps should be taken to further protect and preserve the site:
1) Given the clear abundance of looting, the site should be monitored at least monthly to
identify new episodes of looting. If noted, the site should be obscured by the addition of
brush and reduction of access along the dirt access road.
2) The Frio River road crossing that leads to the base of the midden should be blocked
with screening vegetation.
3) Access to the site from the dirt road is unimpeded. TPWD may wish to consider adding
a lockable gate west of the ranger’s residence to prevent access to the site.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-5

4) Park visitors should be made aware of state antiquities law and penalties contained
therein. This should likely be posted at the park entrance and on trail maps.
5) To avoid curious eyes, and to prevent further erosion and slumping, looters’ holes
should be appropriately recorded then filled with a neutral clearly-defined introduced
material.
6) To minimize a park visitor’s opportunity to linger in the site area, the park bench
closest to the midden (approximately 10 meters to its south-southwest) should be
removed from the area.
7) Site records on file at TPWD, the THC, and TARL should be updated to reflect the
accurate site position as determined during this survey.
8) The site should continue to be avoided during all park maintenance and construction
activities.
Site 41UV33 – Listed SAL – Management Priority 4 – 30% Intact
Site 41UV33 was briefly revisited during the course of survey on a small terrace overlooking the
Frio River’s floodplain. Archeologists found a distinct surficial scatter of lithics and burned
rocks eroding downhill. The site encompasses an area of approximately 600 square meters
and has been subject to significant erosion and looting but is generally away from most park
visitors. Despite thorough surface inspection and subsurface testing, the site’s burned rock
midden was not found within the mapped site area. Several areas of increased burned rock
and flake density could denote where the midden once was but following extensive looting and
erosion the feature is no longer extant. This site is a listed SAL, likely under Criterion 5. This
criterion continues to be applicable.
The site should continue to be monitored quarterly and following significant rains to assess
further damage from erosion. All ground-disturbing activities in the area should be avoided.
Erosion in this context is unavoidable and continued damage to the site is likely through rains
and sheet wash. Efforts should be made to reduce further damage to the site, if possible,
through resodding and application of brush. No further management recommendations are
made for this site.
Site 41UV73 – Listed SAL – Management Priority 1 – 70% Intact
Site 41UV73 was expanded an additional 100 meters northwest to encompass surface finds
encountered at surveyor’s camp areas, bringing the revised site area to approximately 17,500
square meters. The prehistoric lithic quarry and occupation site sits on an upland terrace
overlooking the Frio immediately to the east.
The site contains surficial and buried
components up to 30 centimeters below the surface and is composed of exposed and eroded
scatters of lithics, burned rocks and at least one midden. Two definitive dart points found
during site survey refine its occupational period to the Early Archaic period. The site area
within expanded portions is eroded and deflated and is severely impacted by campsite, road
and utilities construction. One picnic table pad was placed directly over the deflated remnants
of a small midden. Away from developed areas, the site is largely intact. Being found directly
within a camping area, the site is susceptible to intensive pedestrian traffic. Finally portions of
the site were noted eroding off the Frio’s bluff face. While site components at 41UV73, in and
of themselves, will not contribute significant new knowledge of prehistoric peoples, they carry a
great deal of research value for park management practices. As such the site (already a listed
SAL) fulfills listing Criterion 4.
TPWD cultural resources personnel should establish set monitoring locales within different
locations of the camp area (areas of varying use intensity) and record findings (through brief
artifact counts, notes, and a photograph) at each locale, potentially within a predetermined
area (i.e., within a one by one-meter or two by two-meter square at a predetermined, fixed
location). To keep recording accurate, TPWD may wish to consider permanent datums placed

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-6

flush with the ground surface at each locale. Each locale should be revisited regularly (we
suggest quarterly) and recorded in the same manner, with particular attention paid to any
changes observed. To reduce the burden on cultural resources staff, recording can also be
completed by trained park personnel or volunteers. Through repeated visits, these fixed locales
can be assessed for changes over time, ultimately identifying how intensive campsite use
impacts cultural resources.
Site 41UV197 – Recommended SAL Listing – Management Priority 2 & 3 – 30% Intact
Site 41UV197 has been significantly expanded to encompass most of the River Crossing and
Shady Meadows camping areas (100,000 square meters). Survey data concludes that the
northern third of the site (generally all points north of the original park boundary) is composed
of minor surficial lithics scattered across an open gravel bar while tests through the southern
two-thirds contained prehistoric cultural resources at depths of up to 200 centimeters. While
this contract did not allow for survey north of the original park boundary in this area, Site
41UV197 very likely extends north to meet the boundaries of Site 41UV71. Surficial scatters of
flakes were noted within many of the impromptu river access trails along the eastern edge of
the site. One of these scatters contained, among numerous chert specimens, two basalt flakes,
for which the closest source is some 15-20 miles to the south, which indicates extended
resource transport into the region. Several historic artifacts buried at 40-50 centimeters within
shovel tests along the site’s southern and western perimeter may be related to the CCC Camp
Garner or are more likely associated with general camping activity. It is likely when survey is
conducted farther north, the site will extend to the mapped boundaries of 41UV71. The
northern surficial scatter is subject to sheet erosion, repeated pedestrian traffic, and
unauthorized campfires. The southern component has largely been impacted by shelter
construction, road and utilities placement, erosion, and camping.
The significant site deposits (generally south of the original park boundary) are sufficiently
buried that they will not be impacted by regular camp activities, however ground-disturbing
construction in the area should be avoided. To reduce additional erosion from the site’s
eastern boundary, it is recommended that impromptu river access paths be replanted and
screened to focus river access to certain designated locations. No further management
recommendations are offered for the site. This site is recommended for SAL listing under
Criteria 2 and 5.
Site 41UV349 – Not Listed as SAL – N/A – Mismapped/Not in Survey Area
Archeologists revisited the mapped location of Site 41UV349, described as the remnants of a
historic farmstead (cedar post foundation remnants, a chimney, and a sheet midden), but
found no features or artifacts that matched those described in George Kegley’s 1993 site
recording form. The available description places the site east of the new park entrance road,
while the current survey was limited to areas west of it. Diane Dismukes of TPWD has seen
the recorded Site 41UV349 and acknowledges that it is in another location than that mapped.
Being outside of the area slated for the 2008 survey, archeologists did not locate the actual
41UV349 position. Archeologists did record a multi-component prehistoric and historic site at
the mapped Site 41UV349 location that is now listed as Site 41UV475 (described below). At
the earliest opportunity, TPWD should ground-truth 41UV349’s actual locality and revise site
records and maps with its actual position.
Site 41UV449 – N/A – N/A – Not Present within Park Boundary
Recorded in 2005 within the FM 1050 ROW (immediately north of the park boundary), Site
41UV449 contained a small collection of flakes and a core buried at up to 90 centimeters. Site
recorders recommended additional trenching south of the site boundary (within the park) to

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-7

identify additional components. Archeologists intensively investigated the park adjacent to the
site area with shovel tests and backhoe trenches and found no remnants of the site and
conclude that it does not extend into the park. No further management recommendations are
offered for this site.
41UV466 – Recommended SAL Listing – Management Priority 3 – 30% Intact
41UV466 occupies the overwhelming majority of the park’s high ridge. Overall, the site
occupies an area of approximately 66 acres. Cultural deposits are entirely limited to the
ground surface with no site shovel tests containing buried materials. Two surficial diagnostics
found during site investigation include Late Paleoindian and Late Prehistoric forms, indicating
occupation on the site through almost the full prehistoric period, while a dry-laid stone fence
shows site use during the historic period as well. The site is generally very diffuse and has
been subject to extensive erosion and has likely been surface picked by park visitors and
previous landowners for centuries. The site is estimated to be 30 percent intact with low
research potential beyond the effort already conducted.
The stone fence that runs through the site’s southern portion was identified as likely dating to
the late 1870-1880s and could be a property boundary fence or ranching fence from the early
settlement periods of the region’s history. It is possible, as well, that since the fence is located
along the CCC Ridge Trail, it may be an artifact of the Ridge Trail Construction. On the other
hand, the trail could have been constructed to follow the pre-existing fence. The fence is
considered 50 percent intact but many segments have fallen from animal or foot traffic or
simply natural action.
The site should be monitored quarterly (potentially at varying isolated find locations) to assess
the effects of erosion and looting. If extensive looting continues, TPWD may wish to conduct
surface collecting. There is little that can be done in this environment if erosion is identified,
however, newly-exposed surficial diagnostics should be located, recorded and collected,
potentially enhancing our understanding of site function. The stone fence should likewise be
investigated during site revisits to identify evidence of further collapse and take corrective steps
should the wall continue to degrade. Additional research and on-site examination may shed
more light on its origin and function. For interpretive purposes, the fence’s extent and location
should be revised on park visitors’ trail maps and further defined as to its likely age and
association with the earliest landowners in the park area.
This feature would be a good
interpretive opportunity, a wayside could be employed to identify the fence and tell its story.
Given ease of visitors’ access and evidence of looting, this site is recommended for SAL listing
under Criterion 5.
41UV467 – Not Recommended For SAL Listing – Management Priority 5 – 50% Intact
41UV467 occupies a small 900 square meters immediately north of the old park entrance road
near the park’s western boundary. The site’s main component consists of an abandoned road
that is identified as an early wagon road that was further utilized as the original CCC park
entrance road. Additional elements include a possible abandoned CCC drainage culvert lintell,
and a scatter of historic metal, glass, and ceramics. Cultural deposits are entirely limited to
the ground surface. The site connects to the original park access road and a park pedestrian
trail and is subject to occasional pedestrian traffic and slight erosion (the nearby park entrance
road buffers more extensive erosion). The site is not recommended for SAL designation as it
does not have a high research potential beyond that conducted as part of this investigation. If
park personnel wish to highlight CCC activity in the park, the road could be identified on trail
maps and enhanced. The site could be included in a self-guided “CCC at Garner” tour. The
site, however, is not considered significant and no further management practices are
recommended.

41UV468 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 2 – 60% Intact
This buried prehistoric occupation site occupies a large portion of the northeastern group
camping area, encompassing a total of 72,000 square meters. The site contains intact
prehistoric components at a consistent elevation of up to 180 centimeters below the surface. A
buried feature at 50 to 60 centimeters contained possible charcoal flecking, indicating the
potential for organic preservation. In addition to buried site components, flakes and burned
rocks were observed eroding from the Frio River Bank west of the park access road. The site
has been impacted by the group camping area access road and by cutbank erosion, but is
otherwise largely intact. With intact buried deposits and organic preservation, 41UV468 is
recommended for SAL Listing under Criteria 2 and 5.
The site should be avoided and preserved in place. Any ground-disturbing activities within the
site boundaries should be preceded with formal testing excavations to assess the content and
extent of the site in impacted areas. While the majority of the site area is on a relatively stable
terrace, the western periphery is exposed to erosion and possible vandalism and looting by
park visitors. Creekside components of the site should be monitored quarterly to biennially,
with additional revisits following periods of significant rainfall, to determine if erosion is further
impacting intact site components. If significant erosion or looting is observed and features are
exposed, preservative measures (fill introduction and resodding) should be employed to
preserve the feature. The site should be further screened from park visitors through increased
vegetation planting. If erosion or looting are noted and are too significant, exposed features
and other elements should be excavated and recorded in a manner appropriate of the extent
and significance of the deposits.
41UV469 – Not Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 5 – 10-20% Intact
This surficial open lithic scatter is located in a slight cedar clearing, covering an area of
approximately 700 square meters. The site is likely eroding downhill (toward the east) during
periods of rainfall, however, it is remote enough that it is likely not prone to vandalism. The
site is extremely diffuse and contains only a small number of surficial artifacts. Overall
41UV469 has minimal research potential and is not recommended for SAL listing. Beyond
avoidance, no further management recommendations are offered.
41UV470 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 3 – 75% Intact
This surficial historic trash dump site sits along the base and rim of a small drainage gulley
with minimal vegetation. Occupying an approximately 1,500 square meter area, the site is
located well away from any easy access by park visitors and appears to be largely unimpacted
by vandalism or erosion. While artifacts at the dump can be attributed to a variety of periods
of deposition, certain elements are likely attributed to the CCC. These CCC components of Site
41UV470 represent a unique period of the park’s history and the history of the state. The
artifacts further represent a very limited pool of material culture of this group during their time
at Garner.
Given its association with a unique period in Texas’ history, this site is
recommended for SAL designation under Criterion 3. Beyond the information gathered
through this investigation, the site does not bear any significant research potential.
The site should be avoided and monitored biennially to determine if it is being impacted by
vandalism or erosion. If collectors are frequenting the site, it should be covered by brush. For
interpretive purposes, if park staff ever considered creating a CCC-related exhibit, cultural
resource staff may wish to collect some of the better examples of artifacts from the site for
inclusion in the display as it represents what is a likely very limited collection of the camp and
workers’ material culture.

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

41UV471 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 3 – 20% Intact
This prehistoric burned rock midden and open lithic procurement site is situated on a
limestone terrace and gravel bar overlooking two unnamed tributaries of the Frio River.
Occupying an area of approximately 24,000 square meters, the site consists of a single, heavily
deflated burned rock midden perched on the rocky terrace with an open, moderate to dense
lithic scatter on the top of the rise within a large gravel bar. No surficial diagnostics were noted
and no artifacts were recovered within three site shovel tests. All materials are limited to the
ground surface. By far the most significant impact to the site has been erosion and sheet wash
(particularly along the perimeter) while construction of FM 1050 likely also damaged northern
site areas. While the site is generally tucked well away from park visitors, it is very close to two
roads and could be impacted by looting (though no evidence thereof was noted during the
survey).
The site in and of itself is entirely surficial and lacks any diagnostics and as such does not
likely contain significant research potential beyond what has been conducted during this
survey. The burned rock midden is too eroded and damaged to warrant efforts to preserve it.
The site is, however, recommended for SAL listing to afford legal protection from looting given
its location (Criterion 5). The site should be monitored quarterly to determine if looting is
taking place on the site and additional screening plants should be added to the property’s
fenceline should such activity be noted. No further management recommendations are offered
for this site.
41UV472 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 3 – 10% Intact
This prehistoric open lithic scatter with a minor inclusion of historic trash occupies and area of
approximately 1,600 square meters and is situated on a limestone bedrock sheet with no
deposition. The only vegetation is a moderate dotting of cedars. Lacking soils, the site is very
prone to sheet erosion and has likely already suffered significantly from this process over time.
Though it is located immediately south of the second park entrance road, this area is off-limits
to park visitors and is not likely subject to vandalism. However, it has been impacted by road
construction and additional impacts should be avoided. The site is recommended for SAL
listing under Criterion 5. The site components are not considered significant and do not
contain a high research potential.
41UV473 – Not Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 5 – 0% Intact
This prehistoric open lithic scatter site is situated on a wooded, rocky finger terrace overlooking
two branches of Javelina Hollow. Occupying a total area of approximately 2,000 square
meters, the site is largely composed of diffuse lithic debris and occasional burned rocks that
are subject to significant erosion. Being found in a generally inaccessible portion of the park,
this site is not prone to vandalism. Artifacts are likely equal parts primary and secondary
deposition elements that have gradually migrated downhill. Overall the site has minimal
research potential and is not considered eligible for listing as a SAL. Beyond avoidance no
further, management recommendations are offered.
41UV474 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 2 – >20% Intact
The combination historic and prehistoric 41UV474 occupies the northern center of the original
park, just south of the boundary. Situated on a flat, open floodplain meadow, the site has
been impacted primarily by road and facilities construction but is not exposed to the surface
and as such has not been impacted by park visitors. The site contains likely elements of the
CCC’s Camp Garner in the upper 50 centimeters. With only one trench containing elements of
the camp and an abundance of nearby shovel tests that did not, it is unclear how much of the
original camp is left, however, some elements of it clearly have remained. As such the site is

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-10

considered significant to the park’s history and to this unique period of the history of the state.
The historic components of the site are recommended eligible for SAL status under Criterion 3.
The site should be avoided and preserved in place. Any potential ground-disturbing activities
in the area should be preceded with intensive investigation for intact site elements related to
the CCC Camp to better assess the extent and composition of this significant site component.
Barring subsurface impacts from future construction, the site will likely be preserved in place
without concern for erosion or looting. For interpretational purposes, TPWD may wish to
consider using GIS data developed through this survey to delineate the camp’s layout and use
context-appropriate permanent materials to demarcate those features on site, or, for more
subtle denotation, simply use permanent stone markers to plot out the camp’s four corners.
This could be accompanied with a small display or sign detailing the camp and the CCC’s
activities at the park. It could also serve the starting (or stopping) point along a CCC at Camp
Garner self-guided park tour (see below).
Site 41UV475 – Recommended for SAL Listing – Management Priority 3 – 30 % Intact.
This minor surficial prehistoric lithic scatter and early- to mid-20th century historic industrial
or domestic site occupies an area of approximately 21,600 square meters. All cultural deposits
(historic and prehistoric) are entirely limited to the ground surface. The site is so sparse that it
is difficult to assess its completeness, however it is estimated to be approximately 30 percent
intact. The site has been used (likely by park personnel) as a deposit for fencing materials but
has otherwise largely been unimpacted beyond installation of the telephone line along its
eastern third. Surveyors did note possible evidence of looting in the form of a possible cull pile
near the southern site terminus. The site has minimal research potential beyond that
conducted for this investigation. If interest arises, descendants of the Streib family should be
contacted to identify the function of the site’s historic component. Generally the site should be
avoided and routinely monitored for evidence of looting. If further looting is noted, additional
preservative or mitigative actions should be considered. The site is recommended for listing as
a SAL under Criterion 5.
CCC Elements beyond Sites 41UV470 and 41UV474
Particular attention was paid toward locating and briefly documenting design and aesthetic
elements created by the CCC-builders during their more than five year span at the park. Given
funding and time concerns, this was not an exhaustive, dedicated survey of all CCC built
components within the park, but a targeting of less obvious remnants within the less welltraveled portions of the park as well as documentation of more well-known features that may
be in need of stabilization. These features were photographed, recorded with GPS and
documented on standardized CCC Data Inventory forms as provided by TPWD. Obvious built
features, such as cabins, the combination building, the keeper’s lodge, and railings along the
various park roads, were not included.
A total of 28 historic features were identified within the park that are attributed to the CCC’s
construction of the park between 1935 and 1941 (beyond 41UV474 and 41UV470). These
features were found to largely be intact with minimal indication of vandalism by park visitors.
Below are recommendations specific to some of the resources encountered:
•
•

The minor culverts were nearly pristine and beyond clearing away leaf debris and dirt
from the intakes of some, no further work is recommended. Recommended SAL listing
(Criteria 3 and 5).
Headwalls of both of the major drainage culverts, while largely intact, did show signs of
weakening or missing mortar and loosening limestone blocks. Corrective measures
should be considered. Recommended SAL listing (Criteria 3 and 5).

Overlooks 1 and 2 are intact but could benefit from vegetation clearing to restore the
park planners’ intended views. Recommended SAL listing (Criteria 3 and 5).
The manhole along the Madrone Trail was in generally good condition, but should be
cleared of rocks and modern refuse to dissuade its use by park visitors as a trash can.
Planners may wish to replace missing bricks. Recommended SAL listing (Criteria 3 and
5).
The CCC’s 11,000-gallon water tank is largely in disrepair, and, should TPWD planners
wish to highlight the historic built environment, the manholes should be returned to a
semblance of working condition. Recommended SAL listing (Criterion 3).
The Bluff/River Walk is nearly completely inaccessible to park visitors. If this is the
preferred state, no further work is recommended, however, if the park’s historic built
environment is to be highlighted, park planners should clear inhibitive vegetation and
remove chain-link fencing from the fenceline’s southern-most extent. Recommended
SAL listing (Criteria 3 and 5).
The CCC barbecue pit should be preserved and highlighted. Recommended for SAL
listing (Criteria 3 and 5).
The retaining wall at Shady Meadows is recommended for SAL listing under Criteria 3
and 5.
While it is uncertain if they are CCC-related, the cedar-post lanternhooks found in the
Shady Meadows camp area provide an excellent ‘historic touch’ to the camping area.
Should park planners wish to enhance Garner’s historic environment, metal lantern
hooks should be replaced with cedar ones similar to those at Shady Meadows.

Other Features
Several other features were noted during the archeological survey of Garner State Park that are
not directly associated with a historic or prehistoric theme, but do offer interpretational
opportunities and preservation planning.
•

•

The park boundary treeline should be preserved in place and potentially enhanced with
the addition of a sign or incorporation with any CCC Camp Garner signage.
The Champion Cedar (not discussed in this report) was noted and acquired with GPS.
Park management should consider preparing a more significant sign that faces both
directions on the trail so visitors do not pass it without noticing. The sign should be
more descriptive than its current ‘Champion Cedar’ designation. The tree could also be
denoted on trail maps. A specialist should assess the tree’s health and condition and
make recommendations specific to its preservation.
The park’s many caves are either very accessible to park visitors or nearly inaccessible.
In accessible locations (White Rock and Crystal Caves), the formations have been
severely impacted by park visitors with graffiti and etchings and occasional monitoring
at these locations should continue. Inaccessible caves (such as Dos Equis) should be
preserved in place with no further management practices recommended.

INTERPRETIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists have attempted to construct this archeological survey report in
a manner that will assist TPWD staff in the development of interpretational materials to
enhance park visitors’ experience while reducing the load on its natural resources. While none
of the prehistoric sites can be discussed with any degree of specificity, Hicks & Company
recommends using the prehistoric backgrounds and site discussions sections of this volume to
develop either brochures or ranger-guided tours to discuss prehistoric people in the Camp
Garner area and the types of sites that are found here. A great deal of information can be
provided through general discussion of the topic without exposing the sites to curious visitors

or relic hunters. Park interpretive staff may wish to define the known history of the park area,
what types of sites would be found in what contexts and the typical activities of each of the
sites. Educated visitors may be more keen to ‘take ownership’ of the park and be interested in
notifying rangers or staff of artifacts or features they may find rather than taking them.
The park’s historic aspect affords a much greater opportunity for interpretation. Many of these
sites and features are very visible to park visitors and will likely not suffer from relic hunting or
vandalism. Discussion of the historic and specifically CCC features and sites within Garner
was tailored to directly address Julie Strong’s (1996:61-63) recommendations for increased
historic interpretation at the park. More specifically, to provide examples of planning maps
and drawings, to establish a design context for the park’s historic built environment, and, to
the best of our ability, develop a more precise and conclusive chronology for construction
within the park. Ms. Strong’s extensive history and the specific findings from this survey could
be combined to provide park visitors with an excellent self-guided tour of many of the park’s
historic elements, with a CCC-related tour being a particularly exciting prospect.
TPWD planners may wish to develop a map and accompanying narrative that could logically
begin at Camp Garner (which may be highlighted on site or through interpretive signs), proceed
northwest along the Wildhorse Creek Trail (along the way describing check dams) to the park
entrance portal and then proceed east along the original park entrance road. The various
culverts and overlooks could be pointed out and described while hikers proceeded along the
path.
The walk could highlight the intentionally varied materials, the importance of
harmonious interaction with nature, and other themes of early park design concepts. At some
of the sites, planners may wish to include interpretive signs (the overlooks would be good
candidates) that includes some of the planning documents. At Overlook 3, the water tank
could be highlighted as could the Bluff Walk and well. The walk could pass by the Service
Court and Keeper’s Lodge and culminate at the Combination Building, walking along the
Madrone Trail. Similar ranger-guided tours and walks would also be quite feasible with the
information gathered in Ms. Strong’s report and this volume.
Park planners may wish to enlist the assistance of local (or regional) Boy Scout troops to earn
their
Historic
Trails
Award
Merit
Badge
through
(http://scouting.org/boyscouts/advancementandawards/meritbadges/trail.aspx)
developing or installing original material signs along the park trail system or GPS-mapping the
trails themselves as they are remnants of the CCC. A guided tour such as that described above
could also be included in the activities.
This park’s historic heritage is significant and should be a key component of the visitor’s
experience. As it is now, these features are passed without much notice when they should be
highlighted. While it is doubtful that anyone can resist floating the Frio on a hot day (or two
hot weeks, like this study’s surveyors), the park’s rich cultural history may provide some relief
to the taxed natural resources by bringing visitors away from the waterfront if even for a day.

DEFINITION OF ZONES OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY
As part of this survey investigation, Hicks & Company archeologists have developed a model of
High and Low Archeological Sensitivity for all surveyed portions of the park as well as
unsurveyed areas for which there is a generally good understanding of site probability. High
and Low Sensitivity models such as this are used by TPWD and the THC to anticipate probable
impact of construction projects on archeological sites. They assist TPWD planners in guiding
construction projects toward areas that are the least likely to impact archeological sites or to
alert TPWD and THC regulators of potential requirements for additional investigation if
avoidance measures are not viable. As can be seen in Plate A-1, significant portions of Garner
State Park can be considered Zones of High Archeological Sensitivity (at least 465 acres). The

Archeological Survey – TPWD Garner State Park – August 2008

A-13

Zones of High Archeological Sensitivity include all recorded archeological sites, all areas of less
conspicuous CCC development and unsurveyed portions of the park that, from current survey
data, are likely to contain significant archeological sites. These areas are considered to be the
least preferred for park development.
Zones of Low Archeological Sensitivity includes all portions of the park that were surveyed and
were found to be devoid of archeological sites, are too steep to contain any potential for
containing intact cultural resources, or are too developed to likely contain intact resources
within standard construction elevations. These areas are the most preferred for park
development planning.
It is very likely that this model should be adjusted to include additional areas of High
Archeological Sensitivity, however, surveyors did not access significant portions of the park
area and are unable to assess site potential in those areas.
