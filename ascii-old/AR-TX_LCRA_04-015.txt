Abstract
In May and June 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff conducted
test excavations at site 41SS178 in San Saba County, Texas. The site is positioned on a low terrace
within a meander of Mill Creek a short distance upstream from its confluence with the San Saba River.
The test excavations were necessitated by the LCRAâ€˜s proposed construction of a new footbridge that
will cross Mill Creek along the path of a hiking trail. Three 1x2 meter units were placed in the proposed
construction area, each dug in 10 cm levels to a depth of one meter. In addition, one half of each 1x2
meter unit was excavated down another 50 cm.
The test excavations show that this portion of the 41SS178 terrace was occupied exclusively during the
Late Prehistoric Period. Two cultural zones are recognized in the deposits. Cultural Zone 1 lies between
approximately 9 and 24 cm below the surface and contains scattered mussel shell, bones, a few burned
rocks, lithics, and stone tools and bone-tempered sherds belonging to the Toyah Phase. However, this
zone also contains side/corner-notched arrow points that appear to be of the Scallorn type, a diagnostic of
the Austin Phase. Cultural Zone 2 lies from about 19 to 23 cm below ground surface to 41 to 43 cm
below the surface. It contains dense mussel, burned rocks, bone, and lithics. A radiocarbon date from
this zone corresponds to the second half of the Austin Phase, and all diagnostic artifacts also appear to
belong to the Austin Phase. Within Cultural Zone 2, two features -- a burned rock cluster and a mussel
shell lens -- were identified. The mussel shell lens is best preserved in Unit 3, where it rests on an
inferred living surface at approximately 32 to 36 cm below ground surface. In the other two units, the
shells are more dispersed, both horizontally and vertically, by animal burrowing and tree roots. Within
the tested area of 41SS178, an emphasis on mussel harvesting can be inferred from the Austin Phase
deposits while an increase in the consumption of large mammals such as bison can be inferred from the
overlying Toyah deposits.
Only the sample of the mussel shells that was analyzed was curated. This sample as well as all
specimens of the other artifact classes recovered during the testing have been curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

Chapter 1. Introduction
By Daniel J. Prikryl and Charles A. Hixson

Description of Undertaking
In May and June 2010, the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA) Cultural Resources staff
conducted test excavations at site 41SS178 in San
Saba County, Texas (Figure 1). The site is
located within the LCRAâ€˜s new San Saba River
Nature Park (Figure 2), and the test excavations
were necessitated by the LCRAâ€˜s proposed
construction of a new footbridge that will cross
Mill Creek along the path of a hiking trail (Figure
3). Specifically, the construction of a stairway
and
a
semi-circular
ramp
for
handicapped access down the slope of
the terrace for visitor access to the
footbridge landing will affect the
archaeological deposits at the eastern
edge of 41SS178.

different parts of the site, and that it is possible
that more deeply buried components are present at
depths greater than one meter below ground
surface. Importantly, evidences of buried, intact
burned rock features were found at three separate
locations within the site boundaries during the
survey.
The preservation of intact features
suggested that deposits may have a high degree of
contextual integrity, and thus the site was assessed
as potentially eligible for formal designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL). In April
2010, the Archeology Division staff at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) concurred with this
assessment. Later, in October 2010, site 41SS178
was one of six sites in the park that the THC
formally designated as SALs.

Site 41SS178 is one of several
prehistoric campsites that were recorded
during LCRAâ€˜s intensive cultural
resources survey of the park (Prikryl et
al. 2010). At 41SS178, two backhoe
trenches and 13 auger and shovel tests
were excavated during the survey to
demonstrate that buried prehistoric
deposits extended for horizontal distance
of 120 meters on a north-south line by
90 meters on an east-west line. The
subsurface sampling of the upper one
meter of the alluvial deposits during the
survey revealed moderate numbers of
artifacts consisting of chert tools and
debitage, burned rocks, mussel shells,
and animal bones.
The subsurface tests at 41SS178 also
indicated that the depths and thicknesses
of cultural deposits are variable within

The footbridge will be constructed on an east-west
line across the deeply entrenched creek just
downstream from a scenic waterfall (see Figure
3). On the west end of the footbridge where site
41SS178 will be affected by construction, the
terrace top is higher in elevation than the terrace
top on the east side. Thus, the bridge platform
and its associated piers and abutment will placed
approximately one-third of the way down the
terrace slope on the west side of the creek so that
the footbridge will be a level platform (Figure 4).
A circular ramp for handicapped access and a
stairway will be constructed down the west slope
for visitor access to the footbridge landing (see

Waterfall

Figure 4). Depth of subsurface soil disturbances
will generally be 45 to 60 cm in the areas where
the circular ramp and stairway will be constructed.
However, the depth of soil disturbance may be
greater on some steeper downslope sides of
circular ramp. Concrete piers or driven piles will
be used for the bridge landing supports.
No heavy machinery that could potentially
damage the archaeological site deposits through
compression will be allowed within the
archaeological site boundaries during the
construction of the footbridge. Instead, all such
machinery will operate from the opposite side of
the creek. Although it is not expected that
construction of the hiking trail will
impact any of the site deposits, since
the top of the site deposits is at 10 to
15 cm below ground surface, the trail
construction will be monitored by an
archeologist. Also, small light-weight
vehicles, as opposed to heavy concrete
mixer trucks, will be utilized to
transport concrete to various locations
for the trail construction within the site
boundaries to ensure that site deposits
are not damaged.
The test excavation field project at
41SS178 was carried out under Texas
Antiquities Permit #5639 in May and
June of 2010. Daniel J. Prikryl of the
LCRA Cultural Resources staff was
the Principal Investigator and Charles
A. Hixson, a contracted archeologist,
was the Project Archeologist. Other
personnel involved in the fieldwork
were Andrew F. Malof of the LCRA

Chapter 2. Environmental
Background
By Daniel J. Prikryl
Site 41SS178 is located in Central Texas in the
east-central part of San Saba County. The site is
situated on a Holocene-aged alluvial terrace
within the San Saba River valley (Kier et al.
1976). Mill Creek, a tributary of the San Saba
River, loops around the east, north, and west sides
of the site. The creek enters the San Saba River
about 275 meters to the east of the site.
The bedrock geology of the area north of the river
valley consists of the sandstone outcrops of the
Pennsylvanian-aged Strawn Group, while to the
south it consists of the Pennsylvanian Marble
Falls Formation and Smithwick Shale. Numerous
fault lines are present in areas where these later
two geologic units border each other and where
they border the much older Ordovician-aged
Gorman Formation. It appears that a number of
springs issue along these fault lines, including one
or more springs along the upper end of Mill
Creek.
The topsoil at 41SS178 is the Frio silty clay loam
(Bynum 1982: Map Plate 25). This topsoil is
widespread across the entire Holocene-aged
alluvial floodplain of the San Saba River in the
surrounding vicinity. The total depth of the
alluvium ranges from 1.8 to 9 meters (6 to 30 feet)
and it overlies sand, gravels, or limestone
bedrock. Because floods occur once every five to
12 years in the site vicinity, these soils see
incremental deposition of parent material while
they are concurrently undergoing pedogenic
processes. This results in an â€•overthickenedâ€– A
horizon with the upper soil zone less weathered
than the underlying soil zones (Ferring 1992).
This topsoil is described as silty clay loam
reaching an average depth of 165 cm (65 inches)
(Bynum 1982). The color of the upper 55 cm (22
inches) is a dark grayish brown to very dark
grayish brown due to high levels of organic

matter. From 55 cm down to a depth of about 106
cm (42 inches), the soil is a dark brown with
calcium carbonate films. The basal zone from
106 to 165 cm is a C horizon that is brown in
color with many calcium carbonate films and
treads.
The site area is located in the Juniper-OakMesquite Vegetation Region (Arbingast et al.
1976:13). It is generally thought that prior to
Anglo-American settlement, deciduous forests
grew in the valleys of the major streams in Central
Texas while upland areas were covered by a
mosaic of woods and grasslands (Black et al.
1997). This basic pattern still exists today, but the
composition and distributions of plant species
now largely derive from disturbances caused by
modern land-use practices (McMahan et al. 1984).
Much of the San Saba River floodplain today is
considerably altered from its natural state by
agriculture and development. The site is located
in an abandoned pecan orchard that now includes
some hackberry and other trees. No evidence of a
plow zone showed in any of the soil profiles of the
excavation units or backhoe trenches, so it does
not appear that the site area was ever under
cultivation. However, on the opposite side of Mill
Creek to the north and west, the floodplain is now
an open field that may have originally been
cleared for cropland, while to the east on the
opposite side of Mill Creek, a lower terrace
floodplain is now a large pecan tree orchid (Figure
5).
Some nearby areas within the boundaries of the
LCRAâ€˜s proposed park appear less modified.
These include the low terraces and benches near
the confluence of Mill Creek and the San Saba
River, where large pecan trees grow with little
understory woody vegetation, and areas along the
steep banks that harbor a riparian woods (Figure
6). In such areas, the predominant trees are pecan
and hackberry, with a few live oaks also being
present. Other common plants noted on the
terrace slopes along Mill Creek in the immediate

area are pokeweed, elderberry, Virginia creeper,
green briar, and flameleaf sumac. Common
grasses appear to consist of Texas wintergrass,
little bluestem, and Texas grama.
Wildlife found in the project area is typical of
Blairâ€˜s (1950) Balconian Province. Animals
common to the immediate project area are white-

tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, squirrel, raccoon,
oppossum, coyote, gray fox, and skunk. Prior to
their elimination in the historic period, bison,
black bear, pronghorn, jaguar, and red and gray
wolf would have been found in the project area.
Fish that are common to the streams in the project
area are channel catfish, various bass species,
various gar species, buffalo, and carp.

Chapter 3. Prehistoric
Background
By Charles A. Hixson
The project area lies in the northwest corner of the
Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined
over the years by various researchers (Suhm 1960,
Prewitt 1981, Brown et al. 1982). Archeological
regions are identified on the basis of â€•cultural
sameness,â€– a list of material cultural traits that set
one region apart from other regions. For central
Texas, these traits have mainly centered on
projectile point styles. The validity of defining
â€•archeological regionsâ€– and specifically of
defining a central Texas archeological region, has
been addressed by archeologists in recent years
(Collins 1995, Ellis et al. 1995, Black 1997). As a
geographical unit, central Texas has no natural
boundaries and is more an artificial construct
resulting from the present political boundaries of
the state. It does not necessarily correspond to
any past social or cultural network and, in any
event, the geographical extent of any socialcultural systems would have fluctuated over time
making it impossible to define a single boundary.
In the 1960s and 1970s, many processual
archeologists argued that a culture operates as a
system with adaptive functions; as Lewis Binford
(1961), referencing anthropologist Leslie White
(1959), put it, â€•culture is the extra-somatic means
of adaptation for the human organism.â€– Human
ecology and cultural adaptation have remained
important research topics in hunter-gatherer
archeology. Since Central Texas is an
environmentally diverse region, many different
cultural systems must have operated in the past,
probably encompassing more than one natural
subregion. San Saba lies at the ecotone between
the limestone hills of the Edwards Plateau and the
Mesquite Plains to the north, and presumably both
subregions played key roles in the subsistence
strategies of the local population.

Regardless of oneâ€˜s theoretical orientation,
chronological frameworks are considered
important tools for ordering the past.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have
been fine-tuned over the years, with the one most
in use at present being that of Johnson and Goode
(1994). As with all such frameworks for the
region, projectile point forms are used as time
markers to recognize various time periods and
subperiods. Most of the information used to
create the chronological frameworks for central
Texas has come from stratified sites well to the
east of the project area (Prewitt 1981, Johnson
1995, Collins 1998). All these frameworks start
with the three cultural evolutionary periods used
for North American prehistory based to a large
extent on subsistence patterns. â€•Paleoindianâ€– and
â€•Archaicâ€– are terms universally used in North
America for the earliest of the three periods, while
â€•Late Prehistoricâ€– is now commonly used to name
the last of the prehistoric periods in central Texas,
although other terms have been proposed such as
Post Archaic (Johnson 1995) emphasizing a
continuation of subsistence strategies.
The Paleoindian period in Texas has been dated
from 11,500 BP (before present) to 8800 BP
(Collins 1998) and includes the earliest known
archeological cultures of North America. This
period has been traditionally divided into an Early
subperiod, when Pleistocene megafauna such as
mammoths were still part of the subsistence base,
and a Late subperiod after these animals had
become extinct. Paleoindians in Central Texas
appear to have practiced a generalized huntergather or foraging strategy.
The succeeding Archaic period is dated from 8800
BP to 1200 BP (Collins 1998) and has been
divided into three subperiods based in part on
differences in projectile point technology
(Johnson 1995). Like most of the Paleoindian
cultures, the Archaic peoples were generalized
hunter-gathers, with the defining difference being
9

their intensive use of hot rock cooking technology
(Collins 1998). The degree to which such
technology was used on the Edwards Plateau and
adjacent regions to the north and west can be seen
in the size and frequency of fire-cracked rock
accumulations known as burned rock middens
(Black et al. 1997).
The Late Prehistoric periods begins around 1200
BP with the adoption of the bow and arrow and
lasts until 300 BP, when local cultural systems are
starting to be profoundly influenced, directly or
indirectly, by Europeans. Archaic subsistence
patterns seem to persist throughout this period
(Dering 2008), although the appearance around
A.D. 1250 of Toyah cultural traits that includes
new lithic artifact forms and ceramics, would
suggest that changes were taking place. Some
researchers interpret the new artifact types as part
of a toolkit used by a specialized hunting culture,
perhaps to better exploit bison herds that may
have had an increased presence in Central Texas
at that time.

Chapter 4. Previous
Investigations
By Andrew F. Malof and Charles A. Hixson
Archeological work within a 20-mile radius of the
town of San Saba has been summarized in Prikryl
et al. (2010). A comprehensive synthesis of sites
in larger San Saba, Mills and Lampasas counties
area was done in conjunction with the testing of
41SS164, located near Richland Springs (Bonine
et al. 2008). Many sites in the area were recorded
in the 1990s during Texas Tech Archeology field
schools conducted by Grant Hall. During the
1991 field school, 31 sites were recorded on the
Barnett Ranch 25 miles north of San Saba on the
north side of the Colorado River. From 1993
through 1996, Texas Tech field schools recorded
46 sites on the Sloan Ranch, located on both sides
of the San Saba River about 12 miles downstream
from San Saba. Test excavations were conducted
during the field school at one of these sites,
41SS51(Troell 2003). Texas Tech recorded a
smaller group of sites in an area about two miles
east of San Saba.
Colorado Bend State Park, located 15 miles
southeast of San Saba, has been intensively
surveyed for cultural resources by Texas Parks
and Wildlife archeologists and contracted
agencies. The investigations through 1996 have
been summarized by McNatt et al. (2001) when
3,021 acres of the park had been surveyed with 39
sites documented. These included both historic
period sites, such as the Scholten Brothers cedar
cutting operation of the early 20th century, and
prehistoric terrace sites, rock shelters, and burned
rock middens. A sinkhole cave and pictograph
site were also recorded.
A subsequent survey of 1,125 acres of the park by
SWCA (Lawrence et. al 2009) recorded an
additional 18 sites on either side of the Colorado
River. The sites included open camps, terrace
sites, rock shelter and lithic scatters as well as

additional historic sites largely associated with the
cedar operations. Eleven of the recorded sites
were considered eligible or potentially eligible for
formal SAL listing.
San Saba River Nature Park Survey
An intensive cultural resources survey of LCRAâ€˜s
proposed San Saba River Nature Park was
conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services
staff in stages from mid-2009 through early 2010
(Prikryl et al. 2011). It was during this survey that
41SS178 was first recorded.
The survey of the 46.6-acre park tract consisted of
pedestrian survey and the excavation of 83 shovel
tests, 17 auger tests, and 16 backhoe trenches. As
a result of the survey, six new cultural resources
sites, 41SS175-178, 41SS181, and 41SS182, were
recorded and assessed.
Additionally, one
previously recorded site, 41SS113, was revisited
and assessed. Sites 41SS113, 41SS176, and
41SS177 were determined to be multi-component
sites with both prehistoric and historic materials.
Sites 41SS175, 41SS178, and 41SS181 were
found to contain prehistoric materials exclusively,
while site 41SS182 was found to contain only
historic materials.
All prehistoric components appear to be terrace
campsites with site 41SS177 also including a
burned rock midden feature.
Shovel and
mechanical testing generally examined the upper
1.0 to 1.2 meters of cultural deposits at each of
these prehistoric sites. All of these prehistoric
components revealed artifacts mostly consisting
of large numbers of mussel shells, and smaller
quantities of burned rock and chert tools and
debitage.
Diagnostic
prehistoric
artifacts
recovered during the survey investigations consist
of single Late Archaic II dart points found at sites
41SS175 and 41SS176, along with a Toyah Phase
arrow point from site 41SS177. Importantly,
buried, burned rock features were found during

11

the survey work within the prehistoric
components at sites 41SS175-41SS178 and
41SS113. The presence of intact, buried features
suggests a high degree of contextual integrity of
deposits at these sites.
Thus, there is good
potential for stratified cultural deposits at these
sites and there is also a possibility that buried,
stratified deposits with intact features could also
exist in unexamined portions of the remaining
prehistoric component site, 41SS181. Therefore,
all prehistoric components discovered during the
park survey are assessed as potentially eligible for
formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SAL).
The four sites that have historic period materials
are 41SS113, 41SS176, 41SS177, and 41SS182.
At 41SS176 and 41SS177, historic period house
site remains are present. Features associated with
the residential occupations included a standing,
three-room structure at 41SS176 and the chimney
associated with a former house structure at
41SS177. Artifacts recovered around the two
house areas primarily date from the early to mid20th century. A very limited number of artifacts
at these sites date to the late19th century.
Although one informant stated that the house at
41SS176 was occupied during the 1880s by E. E.
Risien, the well-known father of the pecan
industry in San Saba County, there are no written
records to corroborate this information.
A
detailed physical inspection of the house at
41SS176 shows indications of three to five
construction modification phases. The house at
41SS176 was assessed as not architecturally
significant, and the details of its early history
remain uncertain.

Previous Investigations at 41SS178

The LCRA Cultural Resource staff made a brief
reconnaissance of the property in the fall of 2008

prior to its purchase by the LCRA. A few burned
rocks and mussel shells were noticed in the roots
of fallen trees or in eroded areas on the terrace
slopes, but no prehistoric materials were visible
on ground surface.
To further examine the
terrace deposits within the bend of the creek, a
series of auger tests and backhoe trenches were
excavated during the intensive cultural resource
survey of the park in 2009. In total, 12 auger and
shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were
excavated. These subsurface tests showed that the
site extends for a length of about 105 meters
north-south by 75 meters east-west.
Backhoe trenches #1 and #2 were excavated on
the east edge of the site on the terrace edge
overlooking Mill Creek. In BHT #1, a burned
rock feature was observed in the walls of the
trench at a depth of about 50 cm below ground
surface (Figure 7). Approximately 3,000 grams of
burned rock were recovered during the screening
of a sample of fill from Level 3, the level in which
the feature occurred.
BHT #1 was also
noteworthy for having the highest yields of
debitage and larger bone fragments from any
single level excavated during the entire survey.
Some of these bone fragments are the remains of
large mammals, including bison.
At BHT #2, which was placed approximately 30
meters south of BHT #1, moderate amounts of
burned rock were found in the upper 60 cm of
deposits, but no evidence of any actual burned
rock features was seen. The numbers of artifacts
in all other categories were also lower in BHT #2
than in BHT #1.
Shovel Test #30, which was excavated about
midway between these two backhoe trenches,
yielded a moderate amount of burned rock. In ST
#32, which was excavated about 20 meters south
of BHT #2, an apparent burned rock hearth
feature was struck at about 70 cm below ground
surface. Artifacts yields were lower in ST #18,

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
present south of BHT #1 along the east edge of
the site. Cultural materials were found
throughout the 100 cm deep subsurface tests,
and it is possible that other materials may be
present at greater depths. Due to the presence
of intact buried features and indications of
stratified cultural deposits, the prehistoric
materials at 41SS178 were assessed as
potentially meriting formal designation as an
SAL.
Geotechnical Monitoring

On April 28 and 29, 2010, LCRA Cultural
Resources staff monitored geotechnical borings
conducted in advance of the scheduled
development of the San Saba River Nature Park
in San Saba County. The geotechnical crew
placed 12 borings in the Holocene terraces of
the river, reaching depths of 6, 15, or 25 feet.
One boring was done within the 41SS178 site
area on the terrace edge at the west end of the
proposed footbridge. The boring was arbitrarily

About 50 meters west of BHT #1, AT #19 hit the
top of an apparent burned rock feature at depths of
59 to 61 cm. Although few artifacts were
recovered from the screening of fill from this
auger test, the presence of an apparent intact
feature suggests that higher yields of artifacts are
probably present in the vicinity of this feature.
Based on these subsurface tests, it appeared that
the densest cultural materials are located in the
northeastern part of the site where BHT #1 and
Auger Test #19 were excavated.

Chapter 5. Research Design and
Methodology
By Daniel J. Prikryl
To assess the siteâ€˜s research potential, three 1X2
meter excavation units were placed in the
proposed construction area to obtain data that
would address the following questions: 1) Are
intact features such as hearths present? 2) Are
discrete cultural components present? 3) How
disturbed are any components and/or features? 4)
Are artifact classes of sufficient density present
for meaningful research? 5) Is charcoal present
that is suitable for radiocarbon dating?
During the intensive survey, Backhoe Trenches
(BHTs) #1 and #2 along with Auger Tests (ATs)

#30 and #32, and Shovel Tests (STs) #75, #76,
and #102 had all been excavated in the vicinity of
the proposed footbridge and hiking trail. The
circular wheelchair ramp will be constructed
between the areas where BHTs #1 and #2 were
excavated during the survey. Moderately dense
cultural materials were found in the upper meter
of soil deposits in these two trenches and shovel
test.
At BHT #1, which is located about 15
meters north of the circular ramp, a burned rock
feature was observed in the wall of the trench at a
depth of 50 cm below ground surface. A screened
sample of fill from 40 to 60 cm below ground
surface in BHT #1 was also noteworthy for having
the highest yields of chert debitage and animal
bones of any single level sampled from any of the
subsurface tests in the entire survey. The stairway
will be constructed immediately north of
BHT #2 location and several meters south
of the spot where ST #30 was previously
excavated.
Artifact recovery in this
backhoe trench and subsurface test was
not quite as high as in the area of BHT
#1. Although no evidences of features
were observed in the immediate area
around the proposed stairway, an apparent
burned rock feature was struck at 70 cm
below ground surface in ST #32, which is
located about 20 meters south of the top
edge of the stairway.
From the survey subsurface testing, it was
known that mussel shell would constitute
a major if not the largest class of cultural
material from 41SS178. Mussel shell
seemed to be spread out vertically within
the previously examined areas and could
potentially provide diachronic data on
subsistence,
ecology,
and
the
environment.

Figure 8. Crew beginning the excavation of Unit 2 adjacent to
Trench B.

Answering the first question required that
at least one of the test units encounter an
intact feature. To increase the odds of

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
finding an intact feature, two
exploratory backhoe trenches - Trench
A and B - were excavated before any
test units were laid out (Figure 8). The
trenches were placed in areas where
the greatest impacts were expected:
Trench A was placed parallel to the
terrace edge at the upper end of the
proposed wheelchair ramp and Trench
B was placed 10 meters to the southsoutheast on the terrace edge where the
stairway will begin its descent down to
the footbridge platform (Figure 9).
Unit 1 was to be placed adjacent to
Trench A over any exposed features
that may have been exposed in either
the east or west wall. In the same
fashion, Unit 2 was to be placed
adjacent to Trench B.
As it turned out, no features were
visible in Trench A and therefore Unit
1 was placed alongside the trench in
the direct pathway of the wheelchair
ramp. Unit 2 was placed adjacent to
what at the time appeared to be a pit
feature â€“ a bowl-shaped discoloration

Chapter 6. - Results
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl
All three test units encountered approximately 30
to 40 cm thick cultural deposits just below the
surface of the terrace. Within these deposits, two
cultural zones, designated as Cultural Zone 1 and
Cultural Zone 2, are postulated based on
differences in artifact types and densities (Figure
11). While these zones probably represent two
periods of occupations of the site by separate
cultural groups, the material within them is
presumed to have been mixed somewhat by
bioturbation caused by tree roots and burrowing
animals prevalent in the floodplain environment.
Cultural Zone 1 contains Toyah and Austin phase
artifacts and has a low mussel shell density. It
overlies Cultural Zone 2, which is composed of
dense mussel shell deposits containing artifacts
with Austin Phase attributes.
Burned rock
densities are also significantly higher in Cultural
Zone 2.
The upper zone (Cultural Zone 1) lies from 9 to12
cm below ground surface to an average of 19 to

23 cm below the surface. The zone contained
burned rock, scattered mussel shell, animal bone,
lithics, and a few sherds of bone-tempered
pottery. Arrow point styles included Perdiz and
Scallorn. Cultural Zone 1 rests immediately on
top, and perhaps merges with Cultural Zone 2,
which extends from an average of 19 to 23 cm
down to an average depth of 41 to 43 cm. It
consists mostly of a dense stratum or lens of
mussel shell with scattered burned rock and one
burned rock cluster. The lower zone also contains
animal bone and lithics, but in smaller percentages
than Cultural Zone 1 (see Figure 11). The lower
zone appears to have formed during the Austin
phase, based on the recovery of a medial fragment
of a serrated arrow point and two triangular arrow
point preforms. Additionally, a radiocarbon age of
AD 1040 to AD 1260 (Beta 287767, 2 Sigma
correction) was obtained from wood charcoal
recovered within the upper part of mussel lens in
Unit 3.
Below Cultural Zone 2, cultural material was
recovered in decreasing amounts down to the
bottom of the excavation 1.5 meters below

Figure 11. Line chart showing percentages of four artifact classes according to depth. Only two unit halves were excavated
below 98.8, so artifacts recovered from below this elevation came from one-third the volume of soil than those recovered from
above this elevation..

surface. The material appears to have migrated
downwards from Cultural Zones 1 and 2 through
krotovinas and tree root disturbances, which could
be clearly made out in the lighter-colored
sediments.
Five soil zones were encountered in the upper 1.5
meter of the terrace (see Figure 12). The soils are
composed of brown silty clay loams that derive
from the silts deposited by overbank flooding.
Zone 1 extends from the surface to a depth of 36
cm in Units 1 and 2, and 22 cm in Unit 2. It
contains all of Cultural Zone 1 and most of
Cultural Zone 2 in Units 1 and 3. Soil Zone 1 is
somewhat more clayey than the deeper deposits
and darker in color. The dark color is due to a
higher organic content from decayed vegetation
that grew naturally on the terrace and from carbon
staining, charcoal particles, and other organic
material resulting from human activities that
occurred during the Late Prehistoric and perhaps
in recent times as well.
Fine roots from
herbaceous plants and insect tunnels were
common. Zone 2 reaches a depth of 66 cm in
Units 1 and 3 and 54 cm in Unit 2. It contains the
lowest portion of Cultural Zone 2 in Unit 1 and 3
and essentially all of Cultural Zone 2 in Unit 2.
The soil is still mostly a dark grayish-brown but

slightly lighter in color than Zone 1 due to small
calcium carbonate nodules dispersed throughout
the silty clay loam. Larger tree roots up to 10 cm
across were occasionally encountered, and
staining from decayed roots and krotovinas was
fairly common. Zone 3 extends down to 90 cm in
Unit 1 and 82 cm in Unit 2. The bottom of Unit 3
ended at 100 cm still within this zone. The soil is
brown silty loam with heavy calcium carbonate
staining. Several active animal burrows were
struck in this level in Unit 3. Zone 4 extends
down to 120 cm in both Units 1 and 2. It is
composed of a brown silty loam similar to Zone 3
but with less calcium carbonate staining. Zone 5
is the deepest soil zone encountered in the test
units. Like the zones above, it is composed of a
brown silty loam but has virtually no carbonate
staining.

Unit 1 Summary
Of the three test units, Unit 1 contains the least
amount of cultural material in all the major
categories of mussel shell, debitage, burned rock,
and bone. As shown in the Figure 13 graph, the
majority of cultural material in Unit 1 came from
Levels 2, 3, and 4 (99.8-99.5). The percentage of
bone peaks in Level 2 with 65% of the bone by
count coming from that level. Debitage also

peaks in Level 2 but remains high into Level
3. Mussel shell and burned rock percentages
peak in Level 3. The pattern of bone and
debitage peaks overlying mussel shell and
burned rock peaks is seen in Units 2 and 3 as
well. This probably reflects the different
behaviors that took place at the site between
the early and late occupations. The early
group or groups focused their subsistence on
freshwater mussels, which apparently were
cooked on hot rocks, and the later groups
focused more on large game.
A second, smaller peak in burned rock and
debitage occurs in Level 7 (99.3-99.2). Some
of this cultural material appears to have
migrated downwards from the relatively dense
cultural deposits above through the
disturbance observed in the northwest corner
of the unit. However, most of the cultural
material from this level came from the south
half, so the presence of a deeper component
cannot be entirely ruled out. Still, the small
number of artifacts and the clear evidence of
disturbances in the north half (and also in to
the other two test units) suggest that the Level
7 material migrated from the upper levels.
In this unit, Cultural Zone 1 corresponds to
Level 2 with materials generally coming from
about 9 cm to 18 cm below ground surface.
Two arrow points were recovered from near the
bottom of the cultural zone. One represents the
distal portion of a long, narrow point that
probably represents the Perdiz type. The other is
a side-notched point with minimal pressure
flaking that probably belongs to the Scallorn
type. Cultural Zone 2 materials were found in
Levels 3 and 4 from 18 cm down to 38 cm
below ground surface. Deeper, the mussel shell
frequencies decline sharply. The only lithic
artifact apart from debitage from this zone was a
small core.

Figure 15. Floor of Level 2, Unit 2, a depth of 22 cm below
surface.

Unit 2 Summary

Unit 2 located at the terrace edge contained
considerably more lithics, burned rock, and bone
than the other two units, and nearly as many
mussel shells as Units 1 and 3 combined.
Cultural Zone 1 lay from 9 to 24 cm below the
surface, which comprises the bottom half of
Level 1 and all of Level 2 (Figure 15). As with
the other units, it is capped by 9 cm of nearly
sterile soil. This 15 cm-thick zone contained
scattered mussel shell, animal bone, debitage,
and burned rock All diagnostic artifacts appear
to be affiliated with the Toyah Phase and include
one Perdiz point, one probable Perdiz point, and
one end scraper. A rim fragment from a
soapstone vessel probably also belongs to the
Toyah Phase.
21

Figure 16. Profile of east wall of Unit 2 at a depth of one meter below surface.

Cultural Zone 2 lies immediately below Cultural
Zone 1 and consists primarily of a mussel shell
lens that varies in thickness from 19 to 28 cm
(Figure 16). In terms of the excavated levels,
Cultural Zone 2 includes Levels 3, 4 and the
upper part of Level 5. Disturbances caused by
roots and animal burrowing have dispersed the
shell both upwards and downwards in the
sediments from what was once probably a thin,
more discrete lens. Besides mussel shell, the
zone contains appreciable burned rock.
Vertically, the burned rock co-occurs with the
mussel shell and suggests that the mollusks were
cooked with hot rocks. A cluster of burned rock
was uncovered within the shell lens in the north
half of the unit. This could represent a hearth
used to cook the mussels. This feature is
described in depth in the Features section.

In addition to burned rocks, the shell lens
contained scattered charcoal, debitage and tools,
including two bifaces, two arrow point performs,
and an edge modified flake. No obvious Toyah
artifacts were recovered from Level 3. Both
arrow point preforms are triangular in form.
They lack the beginning of a constricting stem
often seen on Perdiz preforms and probably
were destined to become Scallorn points. The
Figure 17 graph shows a slight spike in the
number of bones in Level 12 (98.7 - 98.6).
These bones were recorded as being within a
dark area that appeared to be a krotovina. The
bones represent species that are common in the
upper levels and probably migrated down the
animal burrow when it was still open.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178

Figure 17. Line chart showing Unit 2 artifact percentages according to depth. Artifacts below 98.8 came from south half
only.

The soil profile for the unit shows an upper soil
zone (Zone 1) of dark grayish-brown silty clay
loam 24 cm thick (see Figure 16). Zone 2 is a
somewhat browner silty clay loam 30 cm thick
containing the densest cultural deposits. Zone 3
is also about 32cm thick and changes in color
and texture, becoming a brown silty loam. As
can be seen in Figure, this zone has been
disturbed by large roots or animal burrows that
show up as dark grayish-brown stains in the
otherwise brown sediments. These disturbed
sediments often contain cultural material such as
mussel shell, bone, and lithics. Zone 4 is 42 cm
thick and composed of a brown silty clay loam.
It has been disturbed by animal burrows or tree
roots. Zone 5, the deepest soil zone encountered
in Unit 2 consists of a dark brown silty clay
loam. No obvious disturbances were recorded in
this zone.

Unit 3 Summary
The cultural deposits in Unit 3 are the best
preserved of the three units in that patterning of
the mussel shell deposits can be discerned. As

with the other units, the top of the cultural zone
lies about 9 to 12 cm beneath ground surface.
Cultural Zone 1 includes all of Level 2 and the
top half of Level 3 (Figure 18). In this Zone 1,
two bone-tempered potsherds and a cornernotched arrow point, probably of the Scallorn
type, were recovered in addition to mussel shell,
burned rocks, and debitage.
Cultural Zone 2 takes in the lower half of Level
3 and all of Level 4. In this zone, the mussel
shells occur in clumps or humps that appear to
rest on an occupation surface 32 to 36 cm below
the ground surface. This surface at the north end
of the unit appears to lie at slightly higher
elevation than at the south end, following the
natural incline of the terrace towards the south
(Figure 20). No diagnostic artifacts were found
in close contact with this surface, although an
unusual knife form was recovered within the
shells (see Figure 26a). Charcoal chunks and
flecks were scattered throughout Cultural Zone
2. A radiocarbon sample was taken from the top
of one of the shell clusters in the north half, the
results of which are given in the Features section
of this chapter.

Beneath the shell lens, the amount of cultural
material drops considerably. Many examples of
clumps of artifacts, usually shell, were observed
inside krotovinas or filled-in roots in the lower
depths of Unit 3 (Figure 19). However, these
disturbances were not as extensive as those in
Unit 2.

features were identified Feature 1, a mussel shell
lens, and Feature 2, a burned rock cluster. These
features are described in the next section.

Test Pit Summary

One of the reasons for undertaking the test
excavations at 41SS178 was to determine if intact
features such as hearths are present where the
circular ramp and staircase will be constructed.
During the 2009 survey-level testing, apparent
stone hearths were encountered at depths of
between 50 and 70 cm below the surface to the
north, south, and west of the planned construction.

Two cultural zones are inferred in the cultural
deposits at 41SS178 (see Figure 12 and Table 1).
Cultural Zone 1 lies between 9 and as much as 24
cm below the surface. It contains scattered
mussel shell, bones, a few burned rocks, lithics,
and stone tools and bone tempered sherds
belonging to the Toyah Phase. It also contains
side/corner-notched arrow points that appear to be
of the Scallorn type.
The top of cultural Zone 2 varies from 19 to 24
cm below ground surface and the bottom varies
from 41 to 43 cm below the surface. It contains
dense mussel, burned rocks, bone, and lithics. A
radiocarbon date corresponds to the second half of
the Austin Phase and all diagnostic artifacts also
appear to belong to the Austin Phase. Two

Figure 21. Unit 2 South, Level 3 with top of mussel
shell lens exposed.

Features

Two features were identified during the testing,
both within Cultural Zone 2. Feature 1, a lens of
freshwater mussel shells and other comingled
cultural material, was encountered in all three test
units. Feature 2 is a burned rock cluster found
within the shell lens (Feature 1) zone.
Feature 1, Shell Lens

Feature 1 is a buried midden lens of dense mussel
shell with smaller amounts of scattered burned
rock, bone, charcoal, and lithics. It essentially
corresponds to Cultural Zone 2 (Figure 21). This
lens was encountered in all three units at average
depths of 24 to 43 cm below the ground surface.
Shell density is greatest in Unit 3, slightly less in
Unit 2, and significantly less in Unit 1. Therefore,
the shell lens extends at least 15 meters in a north
northwest line, following the terrace edge. The
earlier, survey-level testing showed that buried
mussel shell is present over a large portion of the
site, covering around 2700 square meters, or
slightly less than half the 41SS178 site area of
5500 square meters.
In Unit 3, many of the shells are arranged in
small, irregular clusters that are 15 to 30 cm
across and 10 to 15 cm thick (Figure 23). One of

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178

clumps.

the larger clusters contained about 50 valves or
half-shells. The shells are stacked together with
little or no soil separating them. The clusters rest
on an inferred former surface buried 32 to 36 cm
below surface. In the other two units, the
clustering was not so obvious and the shells are
more evenly distributed horizontally across the
unit with fewer instances of stacking.

Feature 2, Burned Rock Cluster
Feature 2 was uncovered in Level 3 of Unit 2
South within the dense mussel shell lens or
stratum designated as Feature 1 (Figure 22 and
Figure 24). The feature consists of around 16 firecracked limestone rocks loosely arranged in one
or two layers within a triangular area measuring
50 cm east to west and 50 cm north to south. Ten
of the rocks measure between 5 and 16 cm in
length while the rest are smaller. The largest rock
weighed 600 grams. The entire rock cluster was
not weighed. However the weight of all the rocks
from the level, most of which came from Feature
2, totaled 5,450 grams. The base of the feature
rests at an elevation of 99.50 m, which is
approximately 32 cm below the ground surface.
No evidence of a pit outline, ash, or carbon
staining was observed in the soil matrix around
the burned rocks, although small charcoal flecks

The presence of stacked shell clusters appears to
be the result of human agency and indicates that at
least the portion of the feature in Unit 3 is
substantially intact. The only visible disturbances
were roots and krotovinas that pierced the shell
lens and dislodged shell and artifacts downwards
into the underlying, culturally sterile sediments.
Similar but more substantial disturbances in the
other units probably cause more vertical
movement in those areas.
A radiocarbon date (Beta 287767) was obtained
from a small charcoal sample taken from Unit 3
South at a depth of 27 cm. The sample lay in the
upper portion of one of the shell clusters. The
Conventional age of the sample is 870+/-40 BP
with a 2 sigma calibration of AD 1040 to 1260 .
This date falls within the latter part of the period
for the Austin phase.

were scattered throughout the unit at this level
(99.60 to 99.50 m). Seven larger charcoal pieces
were recovered from outside the feature. Nine,
mostly thin, burned limestone rocks were
scattered to the west of the feature.
Feature 2 could be a dispersed rock hearth or
oven. However, the lack of carbon staining and
charcoal within the core suggests that it might be
a dump, perhaps rocks removed from a larger
burned rock feature located outside the unit. That
this feature was found within the shell lens
suggest that it might have to do mussel cooking.
Hot rock platforms have been used successfully to
cook mussels (Dugas and Rollins 2003).

Chapter 7: Stone and Ceramic
Artifact Analyses and Vertebrate
Faunal Summary
By Daniel J. Prikryl, Glenn T. Goode, and Charles
A. Hixson

Chipped Stone Tools
In the San Saba County vicinity there are three
major sources of siliceous stone that could be
utilized for the production of chipped stone tools.
These consist of chert and chalcedony from the
general Paleozoic Era, the Edwards Formation of
the Cretaceous Period, and Pleistocene-aged
gravels in stream terrace deposits. Although some
of these lithic material types can be distinguished
by color, comparative samples sufficient for a
high level of accuracy in identifying the sources
of these raw materials do not exist at the present
time.
Chipped stone artifacts are divided into two main
classes â€“ tools and debitage. The chipped stone
tools consist of seven projectile points, three
projectile point performs, five other bifacially
worked tools, and one unifacial tool. The major
references used for typology and description of
the project points are Suhm and Jelks (1962) and
Turner and Hester (1993). Other data on these
tools includes metric measurements.

Arrow Points

Perdiz
Lot 71 (Unit 2 North, Level 1): This unfinished
specimen has a contracting stem that is wellformed by pressure flaking, and is the typical
shape of a Perdiz point stem (Figure 24a). The
blade is relatively long and narrow with a
maximum length of 28 mm. Maximum width of
the stem is 16.1 mm, and the overall maximum
thickness is 3.5 mm. The original flake scars are

visible on both faces of the blade, although there a
very small amount of pressure flaking along one
edge. Most of the opposite blade edge retains
cortex. It is probable that the manufacturer
stopped work on the arrow point because of the
anticipated difficulty in removing this cortex
without breaking the blade. The artifact was
recovered from Cultural Zone 1.
Lot 72 (Unit 2 North, Level 2): This fragmentary
specimen has a thin blade with a maximum
thickness of 2.4 mm (Figure 24b). Pressure flakes
extend across both blade surfaces. One shoulder
of the blade has broken off, and the existing
shoulder is barbed. The proximal half of the stem
has also broken off, but the upper portion that is
still present appears to be contracting toward the
base. This characteristic along with the barbed
shoulder suggest that this arrow point was a
Perdiz specimen. The artifact was found in
Cultural Zone 1.
Scallorn
Lot 63 (Unit 1 North, Level 2): This arrow point
has a damaged blade and stem but enough of the
specimen is intact to determine that it has a corner
or side notched stem and an expanding base that
conforms to the Scallorn type (Figure 25c). The
total length of the specimen is 21.8 mm and the
maximum width and thickness are 10.5 mm and
3.5 mm, respectively. This arrow point has a
narrow blade with one side being asymmetrical
due to a break during use and subsequent
resharpening. One side of the blade shows flake
scars from pressure flaking while a portion of the
opposite face of the blade is the original flake
surface. The asymmetrical side of the blade
aligns with a stem side that has also been
damaged from use. The opposite side of the stem,
which is more intact, suggests that the stem
expanded due to side or corner notching. The
base of the stem is convex. This artifact was
recovered in Cultural Zone 1.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Lot 95 (Unit 3 North, Level 2): Only a portion of
one blade edge of this arrow point has its original
edge, as all of the edges of the blade have broken
edges from use (Figure 25d). The specimen has a
mostly intact, expanding stem formed by corner
notching, and the base of the stem is straight. The
maximum thickness of the specimen is 3.3 mm.
Although fragmentary, this specimen appears to
conform to the Scallorn type. This artifact was
found in Cultural Zone 1.
Lot 100 (Unit 3 North, Level 7): This extremely
thin flake with a maximum thickness of 2.1 mm
was apparently minimally modified for production
of an arrow point before the blade broke
diagonally (Figure 25e). The modification
consists of two corner notches for initial
formation of a stem and removal of several
pressure flakes along the base of the stem.
Evidence suggests that the tool maker was
intending to manufacture a Scallorn point. The
specimen was found in an animal burrow well
below the main cultural zones.
Probable Scallorn
Lot 73 (Unit 2 North, Level 3): This arrow point
fragment has the proximal half of the blade and
the distal half of the stem still present (Figure
25f). The maximum thickness of the specimen is
4.4 mm. Although at first appearance one of the
blade edges appears to be serrated, this may be
due to post-use damage. Both blade faces show
pressure flake scars. The portion of the stem
present is relatively wide and appears to be
slightly expanding toward the base, which is
suggestive of the Scallorn type. This artifact was
recovered from Cultural Zone 2.
Arrow Point Fragment
Lot 63 (Unit 1 North, Level 2): This long, narrow
distal blade fragment may come from an arrow
point that was broken during use or manufacture.
Alternatively, the specimen may be a broken
perforator tool. The artifact has one flat face on

which a portion of the original flake scar can be
seen. The opposite face is convex and shows
numerous flake scars on its surface from pressure
flaking. The maximum width of the blade
fragment is 10.1 mm. This artifact was found in
Cultural Zone 1.

Arrow Point Preforms

Lot 42 (Unit 2 South, Level 3): This specimen is a
thin biface that has its distal end missing. The
artifact has a maximum thickness of 4.0 mm and
appears to have been in the middle stages of
manufacture (Figure 25h). The artifact has broad
flake scars on both faces and no pressure flaking
along the edges is present. Overall, the evidence
suggests that the toolmaker was intending to
manufacture an arrow point. This artifact was
found in a level that contains both Cultural Zone 2
artifacts.
Lot 71 (Unit 2 North, Level 1): This thin biface
fragment has a snap fracture suggesting that the
artifact broke during manufacture (Figure 25g).
The artifact has broad flake scars on both faces
and some edge retouch on a small section of one
blade edge. The maximum dimensions of the
portion of the artifact that was recovered are
length â€“ 21.6 mm, width â€“ 20.8 mm, and
thickness â€“ 4.4 mm. The artifact is thought to
represent a broken arrow point perform. This
artifact was recovered from Cultural Zone 1
deposits.
Lot 73 (Unit 2 North, Level 3): This very small
thin biface fragment has broad flake scars and
some pressure flaking along the edge of one face.
Because of the extremely fragmentary nature of
the artifact, the only meaningful measurement is
maximum thickness which is 2.4 mm. This
measurement suggests that the artifact is probably
an arrow point perform. This artifact was found
in Cultural Zone 2.

mussels.

Lot 73 (Unit 2 North, Level 3): This triangular,
bifacially worked specimen has a slightly convex
base (Figure 25i). The blade edges of the distal
half of the specimen appear to have been
reworked so that this part of the blade is much
narrower than the proximal half. One face of the
artifact has a large pot mark resulting from the
artifact being within or near a fire. The maximum
dimensions of the artifact are length â€“ 34.3 mm,
width â€“ 16.5 mm, and thickness â€“ 4.7 mm.

Biface Fragments

The thickness of the proximal half of the artifact
and the reworking the distal half suggests that it
was used as a perforator tool rather than a
projectile point. The artifact was recovered from
Cultural Zone 2.

Bifaces

Complete
Lot 84 (Unit 3 South, Level 4): This complete
specimen is a finished triangular biface with a
narrow, slightly beveled blade and a convex base
(Figure 26a). Rather than having a pointed tip at
the distal end, it has a narrow blunted straight
edge that shows some evidence of retouch. The
specimen
has
the following maximum
dimensions: length - 81 mm, width - 28.5 mm,
and thickness 6.3 mm. The artifact shows minor
indications of small side notches that formed a
stem that may have been more recognizable
before blade resharpening.
This specimen appears to have been a
multipurpose tool that was used as a knife for
cutting with the tip being used for scraping.
Although the artifact was found within the upper
part of the Cultural Zone 2 dense mussel shell
accumulation in Unit 3, it does not appear to

have

in

processing

Lot 42 (Unit 2 South, Level 3): The specimen is a
biface fragment that appears to have been broken
during the middle stage of manufacture (Figure
26b). The artifact has broad flake scars and lacks
any pressure flaking along its edges. The portion
of the artifact that was recovered has a maximum
length of 38.8 mm and a maximum thickness of
6.9 mm. This artifact was found in Cultural Zone
2.
Lot 71 (Unit 2 North, Level 1): This artifact is the
distal end of a thin biface. One face is the flat,
original flake surface and has little retouch while
the opposite side is convex and shows more
evidence of pressure flaking. With a maximum
blade thickness of 3.6 mm, the artifact is within
the range of arrow point performs. However, the
8.0 mm maximum width of the blade makes it
possible that this artifact functioned or was
intended to function as a bifacial cutting tool. The
artifact was found in Cultural Zone 1.

Scrapers

Lot 117 (found during removal of balk between
Unit 2 North and Backhoe Trench B): This
specimen is a complete, circular-shaped scraper
tool (Figure 26c). One side of the biface has a
moderately steep backed edge for scraping while
the remainder of that side of the specimen is
shows evidence of retouched flaking.
The
opposite face of the specimen is essentially flat
like many scrapers, but rather than having a single
flake scar on the surface, 7 or 8 moderate- to
small-sized flake scars are visible. Unfortunately,
the artifact was found during removal of a balk so
that its exact provenience is uncertain.

Lot 47 (Unit 2 North, Level 2): This artifact
represents the distal end of scraper (Figure 26d).
The scraper was made on a simple flake so one
face of the artifact is flat while the opposite side
has a convex surface shaped by several broad
flake removals. However, the bit edge of the
scraper has numerous small flake removals and it
also exhibits numerous hinge fractures resulting
from usage. The artifact was recovered from
Cultural Zone 1.

Other Miscellaneous Stone Artifacts
Steatite Fragment (Unit 2 South, Level 2):
This small gray-colored artifact measures 18.0
mm by 16.2 mm and has a maximum thickness of
5.1 mm (Figure 26e). It was retrieved from the
screening of excavated fill because it appeared to
be a ceramic sherd. Further inspection of the
specimen showed that it was a soft material, and a
series of striations on one surface of the artifact
are visible to the naked eye. These striations
become more apparent under a microscope.
Milton Bell, a former archeologist at TxDOT who
photographed the artifacts in this publication,
independently stated that he believed that this
artifact was steatite. Additionally, Chris Lintz, an
archeologist at the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department, also identified the artifact as steatite.
By definition, steatite is a soft, heavy compact
variety of talc having a soapy feel. Its most
common colors are grayish-green and brown. It is
also known as soapstone, lard stone and potstone.
One edge of the specimen narrows to a beveled
rim edge. In laying the specimen on a ceramic
rim diameter scale, it would appear that the
artifact had a maximum diameter of 20 cm, which
place within the realm of a small bowl.
The closest known source of steatite is the nearby
Llano Uplift where steatite has been documented

in mines near the Oxford community in southern
Llano County about 45 miles south of the project
area (Beste 2005:395). However, no steatite
artifacts of local manufacture have been
documented in Central Texas to the authorsâ€˜
knowledge.
Elsewhere, steatite outcrops in
eastern North America along the eastern flank of
the Appalachian Mountains from eastern Alabama
northeastward to New England (Truncer
2004:489). Steatite pipe bowls and cooking
vessels are found in this region, especially during
the Late Archaic (1800 to 800 B.C.). Steatite also
outcrops along the West Coast from California up
into British Columbia and steatite artifacts are
well-known from those areas. Steatite can also be
found in other isolated locations between
California and the Appalachian Mountains. Aside
from the Llano Uplift, the closest of these isolated
locales to 41SS178 appears to be Hudspeth
County in West Texas.
Central Texas archaeological sites rarely produce
artifacts suggestive of long distance trade.
Perhaps the best researched Central Texas artifact
category suggestive of long distance trade is
obsidian. Although obsidian artifacts are rare in
Texas, Hester has documented the origin places of
many of these rare artifacts through obsidian
sources laboratory analyses. In particular, Hester
et al. 1986 (510-522) have noted that obsidian
artifacts documented at 41SS2, which is one of
the Fall Creek sites at the upper end of Lake
Buchanan, come from the Malad source in
southeastern Idaho, as do other obsidian artifacts
in areas near San Saba County, including Llano,
Bell, Coryell, Bosque, Hill, and Williamson
counties. Since steatite outcrops and artifacts
have been reported in adjacent northwest
Wyoming, consideration should be given to
Wyoming as a potential source of the steatite
artifact.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Red Pigment Stone (Balk Soil off West Wall of
Unit 2 South, 99.56 m):
This rock fragment measures 32.0 mm by 19.7
mm and has a maximum thickness of 12.2 mm
(Figure 26f). The specimen appears to consist of
two distinct layers such as is sometimes seen on
concretions. The outer surface of the specimen is
dark red color that registers as 10R3/6 on the
Munsell Color Chart, while the inner surface is a
yellow color that is 10YR7/6 on the Munsell
Color Chart.
This artifact is thought to have been a pigment
stone that provided red ocher paint, perhaps for
ritual usage, although there are no obvious signs
of use. The red streaking material is most likely
hematite, while the yellow colored material on the
interior is probably limonite. The artifact was
recovered when a balk between the Backhoe
Trench B and the west edge of Unit 2 South was
removed. The depth of the artifact was recorded
as 99.56 m, which would place the artifact on the
boundary between Cultural Zones 1 and 2.
Red and yellow ochre stone materials are
commonly found in the Post Oak Savannah region
of East Central Texas where sandstone bedrock is
common in Eocene-aged deposits.

Lithic Debitage
A total of 922 specimens of lithic debitage from
Site 41SS178 was analyzed using a system of
multiple attributes applied to seven debitage
categories. From what is known of the general
vicinity of San Saba County it appears that all of
the lithic raw materials used at this site came from
sources native to the region. These various cherts,
commonly called flint and chalcedony, were
collected from sources within areas dominated by
either Paleozoic or Mesozoic limestone, as well as
from gravels of Cenozoic age. While our
familiarity with the region's lithic resources is not

great, there have been sufficient observations to
draw general conclusions regarding origins of the
lithic sample.
The method of analysis used by Goode for this
collection has been used on other sites in the
Central Texas region, including previous LCRA
projects at 41BT37 (Prikryl et al. 2004) and
41CM25 (Malof et al. 2007). In this method, flake
debitage is separated into seven categories, based
on (1) the completeness or fragmentary condition
of a specimen, and on (2) the kind of indentor, or
tool (hammerstone, antler billet, etc.) believed
used to produce each specimen. Other key
attributes such as size, color, cortex, use
modification, thermal alteration, and patina are
also recorded.
Debitage Category Descriptions
Debitage Categories (DC) 1 and 2 are flakes
believed to have been made by hard-hammer
(hammerstone) percussion, with DC 1 being
complete flakes and DC 2 being flake fragments
that retain their platforms. DC 3 and 4 have traits
common to flakes made by soft-hammer (mainly
antler billet/hammer) percussion, with DC 3 being
complete flakes and DC 4 being incomplete
flakes. DC 5 and 6 are flakes whose method of
manufacture is inconclusive, or indeterminate,
because their platforms lack distinctive traits of a
particular stone-working method. In many cases
these â€—indeterminateâ€˜ flakes have traits of both
hard-and soft-hammer percussion, while other
specimens resemble pressure flakes, or flakes
made by a less common technique such as
hammer-anvil
percussion.
A
significant
percentage of DC 5 and 6 flakes have, for various
reasons, such a small platform area that
manufacturing
tool
identification
cannot
reasonably be made. DC 7 is for flake fragments
that lack the platform. DC 8 is for lithic objects
such as natural flints, nonflint pebbles, and burned
rock shatter, etc., which are not considered to be
artifacts, although some objects modified by
37

cultural activities are included; most common are
burned fragments of flint. The results of the
debitage category tabulations are provided in
Appendix 1A.
For the analysis of debitage size, the greatest
dimension of the debitage piece is recorded as its
â€•size.â€– Ten size classes were used with size 1
being 1-5 mm, and size 2 being 6-10 mm. The
rest of the size divisions are increments of 10 mm
(i.e. size 3 is 10-20 mm, etc.). Data on debitage
size is provided in Appendix 1B.
Debitage Category Statistics and Comparisons
Flakes vs. Fragments
Of the total of 922 flake specimens, 538, or 58
percent, retain the platform, while 384 specimens,
or 42 percent, are fragments without platforms.
Based on the finding of several arrow points,
arrow point preforms, and one radiocarbon date,
and the absence of Archaic materials, it is
believed that most, perhaps all, of these artifacts
are from Late Prehistoric components. In very few
cases has the lithic debitage from other Late
Prehistoric sites--none from this region--been
analyzed in a way that allows comparison with
Site 41SS178. Therefore, it is not known whether
or not the ratio of 58 percent platform flakes to 42
percent fragments is typical for this place and
time, but 58 percent is high for certain Late
Prehistoric assemblages in the southern part of the
Texas hill country. These assemblages are the
only ones available for comparison.
This also would not be a typical flake-to-fragment
ratio for Archaic assemblages across central
Texas, where the average figure for flakes with
platforms is slightly less than 50 percent. For this
reason, the 58 percent to 42 percent ratio is seen
as one possible corroborative clue to the finding
that the 41SS178 tool and debitage assemblage is
entirely, or almost entirely, of Late Prehistoric
age.

Hard-Hammer vs. Soft-Hammer vs. Indeterminate
Flakes
The next comparison involves only the flakes with
platforms, which is an exercise intended to
identify the kinds of stone-working tools most
commonly used at the site. Of the 538 specimens,
a total of 71 (13 percent) hard-hammer flakes
(HHF) was identified, compared to 349 (65
percent) soft-hammer flakes (SHF), and 118 (22
percent) flakes of indeterminate (IND)
manufacture. Although only flakes with platforms
are used here, it should be noted that the
origin/type of many flake fragments can be
deduced from their morphology and other
features. This was done to some degree for the
experimental Debitage Category called 'Flake
Type. In many cases it is reasonable to deduce
flake type because certain features of both hardand soft-hammer percussion are so distinctive as
to rule out any other method of manufacture.
The main point to make in this comparison is that
it is not known whether or not these
percentagesâ€”13 percent HHF, 65 percent SHF,
22 percent IND--are typical for Late Prehistoric
components in this region. It is known, however,
that these figures are not typical for a small
number of Late Prehistoric components from
another region--Uvalde and Bandera counties-where the 13 percent hard-hammer flakes would
be extremely low and the 65 percent soft-hammer
flakes would be extremely high. All but one of the
studied components from these â€—southern Hill
Countryâ€˜ sites are of the Austin Period. In these
Austin components, the percentage of hardhammer flakes is not only higher, but actually in
the majority. Sites with such components are
Anthon/41UV60
(Goode
2002),
Heard
Schoolhouse/41UV86 (Creel and Goode 1997),
and Rainey Sinkhole/41BN33 (Henderson 2001).
Flake analysis from these sites was also done by
Goode.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Intermediate between these two areas, in the
Mustang Branch site complex of Hays County,
there is a Toyah component at site 41HY202-A
(Ricklis & Collins 1994) whose debitage is high
in soft-hammer flakes and low in hard-hammer
flakes, much like the sample from 41SS178.
Unfortunately, Site 41HY202-A cannot be
compared directly to Site 41SS178 because the
debitage analyses are not at all similar. Site
41HY203, another site in this Mustang Branch
complex, has both Austin and Toyah components,
and there is just enough description to indicate
that both are significantly different from nearby
41HY202-A. The very limited kind of debitage
analysis done for 41HY203 also does not permit
comparison with Site 41SS178, except in the most
general way.
Hard-and Soft-Hammer Summary
The hard-hammer flake sample at 41SS178 is so
small that about the only conclusion possible is
that a limited amount of mostly initial and
secondary stage reduction of flint cobbles was
done on site. A small number of blade fragments
suggest that at least some final stage hard-hammer
work was also done. Such work appears to have
included making flake blanks for arrow points,
unifaces and expedient tools. The small size of the
hard-hammer sample also suggests that there was
no significant source of suitable siliceous stone
nearby. However, the overall debitage sample is
small and only one portion of the site was tested,
so any conclusions are made with that in mind.
The reason that soft-hammer flakes predominate
at Site 41SS178 is not obvious, as the assemblage
contains only eight bifacial specimens which are
mostly fragments of unfinished bifaces. In other
words, there are not enough bifaces to understand
what kinds of bifacial tools were being made at
the site. Suffice it to say that soft hammers were
the flint knapping tools most often used in the
tested portion of the site, and bifaces are the stone
tools that most likely were made.

In terms of lithic debitage, site 41SS178 does not
have a close match in any other reported Late
Prehistoric sites. In fact, the hard-hammer vs. softhammer figures are very similar to many Archaic
lithic assemblages from across central Texas. This
is believed to be merely a coincidence, though, as
there appears to be no question about the age of
the main components at Site 41SS178. Even so,
there may be minor admixture of Archaic
materials, as there does not seem to be evidence
that a small amount of Archaic material could not
have been on the surface, or shallowly buried
when the Late Prehistoric occupations began.
Flakes of Indeterminate (IND) Origin
The flakes in this category lack features, primarily
of the platform area, that are necessary to identify
their method of manufacture. The flake sample of
indeterminate origin is a fairly high 22 percent, as
it has been observed in many assemblages, mostly
Archaic, that samples between 10 percent and 20
percent are more common. The reasons for this
larger sample are not readily apparent, but the
relatively small size of the raw materials/artifacts
being worked can promote small, thin, and
irregular platforms that are more subject to shatter
and atypical shapes. The flint knapping tools used
to produce this sample are the same hard- and-soft
hammers and pressure tools that produced the
identifiable sample, but the IND flakeâ€˜s platforms
do not have clear features of any one kind of
knapping tool. As far as is known, the somewhat
higher percentage of indeterminate flakes is not a
significant cultural feature.
It is clear that soft hammers were most commonly
used at 41SS178, but inasmuch as hard hammers
tend to produce more platform shatter, etc. than
soft hammers, it would not be unreasonable to
suspect that hard hammers produced numbers of
indeterminate flakes disproportionate to overall
hard-hammer usage. If so, then the actual hard
hammer sample might be closer to 20 percent,
with the actual soft hammer sample conceivably
39

being as high as 75 percent. In any event, the
actual numbers of hard-and soft-hammer flakes
produced at the site are somewhat higher than the
stated figures.
Austin Phase vs. Toyah Phase Debitage at Site
41SS178
Analyses of lithic debitage from a small number
of sites have revealed that the debitage from
Austin Period and Toyah Period sites can be
similar, but also quite different. For example,
both periods usually have a relatively high
percentage of hard-hammer flakes even though
they were to some extent making different kinds
of tools from those hard-hammer flakes. At Site
41SS178 the two components are not absolutely
discrete and there doubtless is some mixing, but it
does seem possible to say that the majority, if not
all, of certain levels is either Austin or Toyah.
Based on the apparent semi-stratification of the
Austin and Toyah components, 295 of the 922
debitage specimens are considered to be of Toyah
age.
The percentages of DC 1 - 7 from the Toyah
component, then, are virtually identical to the
overall percentages already obtained. Toyah hardhammer flakes comprise 14.5 percent; softhammer flakes comprise 65.5 percent; and
indeterminate flakes comprise 20 percent of the
total. Compare that to: HHF - 13 percent; SHF 65 percent; and IND - 22 percent of the overall
samples. In other words, there does not appear to
be any discernible difference between Austin
phase and Toyah phase debitage at this site.
Size of Soft-hammer Flakes
A notable feature of the soft-hammer flakes is
their overall small size. The great majority of
them are less than 30 mm in greatest dimension
(Size Cat. 4: 21 - 30 mm), with the most abundant
category being Size Cat. 3: 11 - 20mm. A
preponderance of soft-hammer flakes this small

come from the final stage, or nearly so, of tool
production. Of the Size Cat. 3 flakes, and the even
smaller Size Cat. 2, there are some that may very
well be pressure flakes. The platform
characteristics of some small soft-hammer flakes
and certain pressure flakes overlap, making
identification or separation impossible. In most
cases, however, such identification is not a critical
issue--the important issue is that both kinds of
flakes come from the final stage of biface
manufacture. An unusually high percentage of
these very small flakes are complete flakes, which
is not obviously significant but is perhaps the
result of a particular knapping technique in the
final stage of manufacture.
The greatest number, by far, of these small softhammer flakes are tertiary, or interior, specimens
lacking cortex. This is usually the case with small
soft-hammer flakes because, as previously noted,
they are from the final stage(s) of tool making.
The combination of the two attributes -- small size
soft-hammer and lack of cortex -- is a deadgiveaway that tools were made/finished at the site.
In this case, the most likely kinds of tools finished
at Site 41SS178 include bifaces such as knives of
small-to-moderate size, arrow points, unifaces,
and trimmed flakes.
Size of Hard-hammer Flakes
In the small sample of hard-hammer flakes there
are enough of sufficiently large size, and mostly
with some cortex, to indicate that at least some
primary reduction of cortex-covered cobbles
occurred at the site. A majority of hard-hammer
flakes are smaller than 40 mm and derive from
various activities such as core shaping, platform
preparation, and initial stage biface shaping.

Cortex, Thermal Alteration, and Patina in the total
sample:

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Cortex
Cortex, a surficial covering or rind on flint
cobbles, was present on 223 specimens, or 24
percent of the debitage sample (Appendix 1C). A
majority of specimens had less than 50 percent
cortex, and the overall modest sample suggests
that a substantial source of flint did not occur
nearby, as noted previously. Percentages of cortex
such as these often indicate that most of the tool
stone came to the site in an already reduced state.
Thermal Alteration:
Thermal alteration of one kind or another was
present on approximately 195 specimens, or 21
percent of the lithic sample (see Appendix 1C).
This
figure
includes
both
specimens
unintentionally burned in fires and specimens
from intentionally heat-treated preforms, and it is
an approximate figure because it is often difficult
or impossible to distinguish one kind of thermal
alteration from another.
Patina
Silica loss and color change from the weathering
of certain lithic debitage specimens resulted in a
patina that is mostly some shade of white or
yellowish white. Quite often, it can be
demonstrated that patinated specimens are the
oldest, or among the oldest, at a particular
prehistoric site. A relatively small sample of 52
specimens, or 5.5 percent, had patination in
widely varying degrees (see Appendix 1C). Lithic
artifact patination in Late Prehistoric contexts is
relatively uncommon, and the artifacts with
patination often were patinated before they were
collected by Late Prehistoric peoples. The
collection of older artifacts was a common
practice in Late Prehistoric times.

These sources are Paleozoic limestone, Mesozoic
limestone, and gravels of Cenozoic age. An
attempt was made to identify the sources where
raw material was procured, although comparative
samples sufficient for a high level of accuracy do
not exist. There is a wider range of color in this
debitage sample than exists in most samples from
central Texas. 'Color' was the main criterion used
to separate specimens believed to be from
Paleozoic formations from those apparently
derived from Mesozoic formations.
The considerable variation in color and
combinations of colors made it necessary to use
15 color codes and some of these codes cover a
range or mixture of colors. For example, there is a
considerable range of color within Code 1-brown. Most of the specimens believed to be
Paleozoic fall within these Color Codes: 4 (Paleo
gray), 5 (yellowish red), 8 (yellow brown), 9
(white/mottled), 11 (red mottled), 12 (black), and
13 (pink). With the exception of Color Codes 6
and 14, which represent burned and patinated
specimens, all of the other color codes were
assigned to Mesozoic era cherts.
The tabulations in Appendix 1D show that 59
percent of the cherts and chalcedonys are
Mesozoic and 31 percent are Paleozoic. The
remaining 10 percent cannot be confidently
assigned to either category because of burning or
patination. Basically, the Mesozoic era specimens
are approximately twice as numerous as the
Paleozoic specimens. These percentages may be
due to the fact that there is probably less chert and
chalcedony present in Paleozoic era outcrops and
formations. Further, it is probable that the
Paleozoic chert and chalcedony cobbles are
generally smaller in size and thus were less
desirable to Native Americans for the production
of chipped stone tools.

Color
In the vicinity of San Saba County there are three
major sources where siliceous stone can be found.
41

rounded grains of quartz sand were seen in the
otherwise fine paste. The more oxidized areas of
the sherdsâ€˜ surfaces are very pale brown
suggesting all were made from clay with a low
iron oxide content. Cores were generally less
oxidized than the surfaces with a pale gray color.

25 mm maximum dimension.

Aboriginal Ceramics from 41SS178
Three aboriginal ceramic sherds were recovered
during the test excavations, all from within the
upper 20 cm of sediments. The three sherds are
very similar in color, surface treatment, paste and
temper, and all could come from the same vessel.
The analysis of the sherds was done by visually
examining their surfaces and broken edges with a
binocular microscope.
The sherds contain
abundant crushed bone but no attempt was made
to quantify the density. The bone has been
reduced to a very fine size, nearly all fragments
being a few tenths of a millimeter or less in
maximum dimension. In shape, the temper is
generally angular with a few showing the
cancellous, or spongy structure of osseous tissue.
In color, the bone particles are predominately
white but grade into black from carbon
absorption, which may have occurred during
burning of the bones prior to crushing. Carbon
absorption may also have occurred during firing
and its subsequence use as a cooking pot. A few

The Lot 53 sherd shown in Figure 27 was
recovered while screening dirt and leaves from the
surface of the south half of Unit 1. Presumably it
migrated to the surface by means of some
unexplained disturbance since the sediments
containing cultural material at the site are
typically covered by nine centimeters of sterile
soil. This sherd is the largest of the three
recovered during the testing, measuring 25 mm in
its longest dimension and 21 mm in its shortest.
Because of its size, the sherd exhibits a slight
curvature when viewed on edge and therefore an
exterior and interior surface can be discerned,
which is not the case with the two smaller sherds.
This sherd also differs from the others in its
greater thickness, which varies between 9 mm and
7.5 mm. It probably came from the outer edge of
the base since the bases of bone-tempered pots
from the region are typically thicker than the
walls. The interior surface of the sherd is free
from carbon soot and the clay relatively welloxidized. The Munsell color is 10YR 7/3,
described as a very pale brown. The interior
surface is fairly well burnished and reflects light.
The burnishing has embedded numerous
fragments of crushed bone flush with the surface,
which probably lightens the color, or decreases
the chroma, somewhat. The exterior surface is
about 70 percent covered by carbon impregnation
(fire-clouding) giving it a very dark gray Munsell
color of 5Y 3/1. The remaining surface has a light
gray Munsell color of 10YR 7/2. This slightly
lower chroma than the interior surface indicates a
less oxidized clay. Tempering is much less
noticeable on the exterior surface, but it too has
been burnished and shows a slight sheen. The
core color grades from gray near the exterior to

1 cm

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
pale brown towards the exterior with slight carbon
staining.
No organic residue was seen on the interior
surface of this sherd. However, on the exterior
surface were several small patches of a translucent
brown substance less than 1 mm across. These
might be resins from wood used to heat the pot
during firing or cooking, or could be the result of
post-depositional contact with the surrounding
soil. Because they are attached to the exterior
surface, these residues are probably not the
remains of any foods that were cooked, served, or
stored in the vessel.
The two sherds found in Cultural Zone 1 of Unit 3
are nearly identical in size and in all other
visually-apparent characteristics. Both are about
10 mm across and 5mm thick. Sherd 3N2-4 was
recovered from the north half of the unit while
screening dirt taken from Level 2, which lies from
six to 16cm below the surface. Sherd 353-1 was
recovered from the south half at a depth of 20 cm,
which places it near the top of the shell lens of
Cultural Zone 2. While no fire clouding is evident
on these sherds, one surface of each appears more
oxidized than the other, since it has a slightly
higher chroma. The more oxidized surface has a
Munsell color of very pale brown (10YR 7/4)
while the opposite surface, which is also described
as a very pale brown, has less chroma at 10YR
7/3. The surface with the lower chroma side
appears slightly more burnished than the other
surface and reflects light along polishing marks.
The temper appears similar to that of the Lot 53
sherd with numerous bone fragments embedded
flush on both surfaces.
Because of the strong similarities in paste and
surface treatment, not to mention their tight
provenience, the sherds probably came from the
same vessel, the Lot 53 sherd from along the
vesselâ€˜s base, and the other two from near the rim
where the potâ€˜s wall would be thinnest. Neither
the vesselâ€˜s approximate shape nor its size can be

inferred from these small sherds. The fact that
both surfaces are smoothed and polished suggests
that the vessel was an open form, either a jar or
bowl, since an enclosed form, that is an olla,
would probably not have its interior surface so
carefully finished.
The abundant bone tempering suggests that the
vessel was manufactured by someone with a
Toyah cultural affiliation. At 41SS178, this
cultural group is represented by the Cultural Zone
1 component from which one the sherds, 3N2-4,
was recovered. The other two sherds presumably
originated from this same cultural zone but were
subsequently displaced vertically by unknown
disturbances, one upwards onto the ground
surface and the other downwards into the Cultural
Zone 2 deposits.

Summary of Analyses of Vertebrate
Faunal Materials
A complete analysis of the vertebrate materials
recovered during the test excavations at 41SS178
was conducted by Barbara Meissner and is found
in Appendix 2. Meissner found that of the 329
bones examined, 265 could be identified only as
mammal bones.
Only 16 bones could be
identified to the genus taxonomic level, and these
16 represented eight different genera. Meissner
divided the bones into four categories consisting
of 1) very large, 2) large, 3) medium, and 4) small
in order to provide data on the relative importance
of various sized vertebrates to the diet of the site
inhabitants. The results of this exercise, which are
provided in Table 5 of Appendix 2, indicate a
reliance on deer-sized and bison-sized animals.
Also, turkey-sized birds appear to have been
important to the peoplesâ€˜ diet. Meissner notes an
absence of rat-sized animals and a near absence of
fish.

43

A comparison of the types of vertebrate faunal
materials recovered in the two cultural zones is
shown on the Table in Appendix 3. The most
striking data in the recovered materials are as
follows: 1) a noticeably higher percentage (64
percent) of large mammal bones were recovered
in Cultural Zone 1 than in Cultural Zone 2, 2) a
higher percentage of mammal bones of
indeterminate sized mammals were recovered in
Cultural Zone 2 in comparison to Cultural Zone 1,
3) thirteen turtle bones were found in Cultural
Zone 2 but none in Cultural Zone 1, and 4) a
much higher percentage of large bird bones (78
percent) were found in Cultural Zone 2 in
comparison to Cultural Zone 1.
The higher number of very large mammal bones
in Cultural Zone 1 is interpreted as related to
bison procurement to the Toyah Phase occupants.
The larger number of mammal bones of
indeterminate size in the Cultural Zone 2 levels
could be the result of more intensive food
processing including smashing mammal bones
into small fragments for extraction of marrow and
for bone grease rendering. The larger number of
very large bird bones in Cultural Zone 2 and the
fact that all identified turtle bones come from
Cultural Zone 2 may suggest that the occupants
related to that era needed to exploit birds and
turtles for food due to the lower numbers of
available very large mammals. These data along
with the prolific numbers of river mussel shells in
Cultural Zone 2 may indicate a wider diet breadth
in comparison to Cultural Zone 1. However, it
should be emphasized that the sample size is too
small to make strong interpretative statements.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Chapter 8. Mussel Harvesting at
41SS178
By Charles A. Hixson

Introduction
The most striking feature at 41SS178 is the
mussel shell lens, apparent evidence that intensive
mussel harvesting took place during the Austin
Phase of the Late Prehistoric Period as indicated
by a radiocarbon date of AD 1040 to 1260 (2
sigma calibration) and the occurrence of several
diagnostic arrow points. The shell lens was
encountered in all three test units in roughly the
same stratigraphic unit at depths averaging from
24 to 43 cm below ground surface (see Table 1).
A detailed description of the shell lens is provided
in the Feature section in Chapter 4 of this report.
Mussel shells were also recovered from other
areas of 41SS178 that were tested during previous
surveys, although with less vertical control, which
indicates that the feature could extend across a
large area of the site (Prikryl et al. 2011). The
shell lens also contains lithic artifacts, bone,
charcoal, and significant amounts of burned rock.
The close association of shell and burned rock at
the site suggests that the mussels were cooked (or
steamed) using heated rocks, a process described
both ethnographically (Parmalee and Klippel
1974) and by modern experimental archeology
(Dugas and Rollins 2003).
Freshwater mussels are a type of bivalve mollusks with two shell halves or â€•valvesâ€– classified under several closely related families,
the largest being Unionidae. All native mussels in
Texas belong to the Unionidae family and as a
group are referred to as unionids (Howells et al.
1996). They are not closely related to the marine
mussels, which belong to a separate subclass
altogether but share the same common name
because both have asymmetrical, usually
elongated shells. The term â€•clamâ€– is often

reserved for bivalves that have round,
symmetrical shells, but â€•clamâ€– can also be used in
a general sense for all bivalves, including
unionids.
Other native freshwater bivalves
besides unionids are found in Texas streams but,
with the exception of the Rangia mollusks that
live in coastal brackish waters, were of little
economic importance in prehistoric times because
of their small size and, for some species, patchy
distribution.
While mussel valves are commonly found at
prehistoric habitation sites in central Texas, these
are usually scattered in low to moderate densities
within site deposits or clustered in small features
containing less than one hundred valves. The
density is often so low that it has led to
speculation that the mussels or their shells were
brought to some sites for reasons other than for
food or that they reached the site through natural
forces such as floodwaters or carnivores.
However, the large number found at 41SS178 is
strong evidence that the mussels were brought to
the site to be consumed as food.
The ultimate expressions of intensive mollusk
harvesting are shell mounds or middens that can
be seen on shorelines worldwide. On the Texas
coast, prehistoric middens containing oyster shells
and Rangia clam shells are well documented
(Aten 1983). Saltwater mollusks are often more
efficiently harvested than freshwater species
because they are found in dense and extensive
beds near the shoreline. Freshwater mussel beds,
in contrast, contain fewer mollusks and thus
extend the harvesting time and range. Some
exceptions are found in the American Southeast
where dense freshwater mussel beds do occur and
that were intensively harvested during the Shell
Mound Archaic from 5500 to 3000 years ago
(Claassen 1991).
Despite the strong evidence for the consumption
of shellfish by foraging groups worldwide,
45

mollusks are generally considered a â€•low valueâ€–
food source by both researchers (Parmelee et al.
1974) and by some members of the communities
who harvest them (Claassen 1991). Part of this
may have to do with the low food value relative to
that of vertebrate animals (Table 2 ), a topic that
will be discussed in detail later in the chapter.

over a long period of time.
It appears that mussel harvesting dropped off
significantly in the latest, apparently Toyah
occupation at 41SS178, since Cultural Zone 1
contains much less shell and proportionally more
bone than Cultural Zone 2. It is even possible that
all the shell in the upper component was dislodged
from the shell lens and that the Toyah occupants
shunned mussels all together, relying completely
on terrestrial animals and perhaps plant foods that
have not preserved.

Mussel shell is by far the most common class of
cultural material recovered from all the prehistoric
sites along Mill Creek during the archeological
survey of the San Saba River Nature Park (Prikryl
et al. 2010). Another mussel shell lens of similar
if not greater density and thickness to that at
41SS178 was encountered in a backhoe trench
dug at 41SS176, the site furthermost upstream in
the park. The only diagnostic artifact found at
41SS176 is a Darl point, which suggests that the
site was at least partially occupied during the later
part of the Late Archaic. The frequency of intense
mussel harvesting is unknown and can only be
learned through excavation of more sites.
Geophysical coring at 41SS177 immediately
upstream on Mill Creek from 41SS178
encountered mussel shell fragments continuously
from the surface down a depth of 12 feet (3.6
meters). The ages of the deeper deposits at
41SS177 are unknown, but this evidence does
show that mussel exploitation in the area occurred

Analysis of the Mussel Shells
Considering the amount and depth of mussel shell
recovered during the survey-level testing at
41SS178, it was hoped that the data from the
testing phase could be used for a diachronic study
of the effects of long term harvesting on mussel
demographics, such as size and species
composition. As it turned out, the site was
occupied by humans during a relatively narrow
time frame, and these occupations are poorly
separated in sediments near the surface. More
importantly, significant mussel harvesting
apparently occurred only during the earliest
occupations. The present study is by necessity
synchronic, dealing with a shell accumulation

for a subset of each species in the sample
measured using metric calipers.

Even before an analysis was done on a sample of
the mussel shell recovered from the site, several
aspects about the 41SS178 shell lens stood out:
(1) the large number and high density of mussel
shell in Cultural Zone 2 compared to that in
Cultural Zone 1 and, for that matter, to other sites
in the central Texas region; (2) only two types or
species of mussels make up nearly all the
specimens recovered even though ten species are
known to inhabit the San Saba River system at the
present time, with an additional nine species
known elsewhere in the Colorado River system
(Table 3); and (3) the size range of the mussel
shells is considerably below that of adult
specimens of the same species found today, a
phenomenon consistently noted in archeological
assemblages from Texas and the Southeast (see
Peacock 2000).

The shells from 41SS178 were well-preserved
relative to those typically found at archeological
sites and measurements using interior shell
features as described in Randklev et al. (2009)
were not used. Instead, shell length was measured

The analyzed sample consisted of all the mussel
shell valves, including hinge fragments with the
pseudocardinal teeth from the south half of Unit 2.
The sample contained 626 valves, or 21.3 percent
of the total recovered during the test excavations.
This unit half was chosen for the sample because
it had a relatively large number of shells and
because it was excavated down to 1.5 meters,
which world provide information on the vertical
displacement of the shells by tree roots and animal
burrowing.
The analysis included species
identification and shell dimensions for each of the
15 levels of Unit 2 South.

A description of this mussel shell sample is
provided in Table 5 and Table 6. Table 5 gives
numbers for each species per level. Species were
identified using information provided by Howells
et al (1996) and Howells (2002). Robert Howells
was also consulted in person to help identify
certain specimens. Table 6 gives the dimensions

as the greatest possible distance between the
anterior and posterior margins. Height was
measured as the greatest possible distance
between the dorsal and ventral margins. A
particular dimension was recorded only if both
shell margins were intact. Of the 536 shells that
were identified as to species, 207 (39 percent) had
all their margins intact, and 107 (20 percent) had
enough of their margins intact so that either length
or` height could be measured. Width was
measured by placing one end of the calipers at the
highest part of the shell between the dorsal edge
and the anterior slope and other end of the calipers
on the shellâ€˜s margins at the open side. This
measurement was then multiplied by 2 to account
for the missing half.

Mussel Shell Density at 41SS178
Mussel shell valves were recovered from nearly
every unit-level excavated. However, most of
these shells (70 percent) came from a 20 to 30 cm
thick stratum that includes all of Cultural Zone 2
and the lower few centimeters of Cultural Zone 1.
As discussed earlier in the report, there is
evidence that the majority of the shells were
originally deposited on a surface now buried
about 32 to 36 cm below the present ground
surface.
The shells have apparently been
dispersed by bioturbation and other disturbances
and their original pattern was only clearly
observed in Unit 3 as a series of clumps.
There are problems with any dietary interpretation
of the shell lens at 41SS178. The time duration of
Feature 1â€˜s accumulation is unknown and the
feature could have formed slowly over many
visits to the site, minimizing the nutritional
contribution of mussels. In the last 900 years,
aggradation of the terrace sediments has occurred
at the extremely slow rate of about four
centimeters per century. This figure is based on

the thickness of the sediments that overlie the base
of the shell lens, radiocarbon dated to AD 1040 to
1260 (2 sigma calibration). Another problem is
that other foods were also consumed at the site
during the period in question and these could have
provided even more calories and other nutrients
than mussels without leaving an archeological
signature. Also, the place we have designated
41SS178 may represent a special activity area
primarily used to cook mussels that lies within a
larger site with other areas where other kinds of
foods were processed and cooked. The adjacent
site, 41SS177, for example, has a burned rock
midden, a type of feature that forms around ovens
primarily used to cook plant foods such as
geophytes or desert succulents (Black et al. 1996).
Shell density ranges from a low of 199 valves per
cubic meter in Unit 1 to a high of 698 valves per
cubic meter in Unit 3. The average shell density
in the tested area is 490 valves per cubic meter.
The survey-level testing done earlier in the site
suggests that the shell lens may cover an area of
around 2,700 square meters. If the shell density in
the excavated area is representative of the entire
feature, then as many as 1.3 million valves could
be present at 41SS178, or the remains of over
600,000 individual mussels.
Mussels would
appear to have been a major component of the diet
during the Austin phase occupations. However,
as we will see, the small size of specimens
collected from the site indicates that the amount of
meat represented by the shells is extremely low.
Lintz (1996) provides nutritional data on mussels
collected from the Colorado River drainage
upstream from the San Saba River. The Quadrula
species in his study were considerably larger than
the Quadrula species from 41SS178.
His
minimum shell length measurement for this genus
(60.2 mm) was almost twice the average of the all
the 41SS178 Quadrula species (31.8 mm) from
the analyzed sample. Quadrula species make up
most of the mussels from the site. Extrapolating

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
from Lintzâ€˜s data, the average 41SS178 mussel
with a shell length of 35.0 mm would provide
roughly 3 grams of meat, or 2.4 K-calories and
0.37 grams of protein. An individual would have
to eat around 600 mussels of the average size
found at 41SS178 to meet their daily caloric
needs. A small band of 20 to 30 individuals
would require 12,000 to 18,000 mussels daily if
they were relying exclusively on this food
resource. A major problem with relying on
protein to satisfy caloric needs is that it can lead to
a form of malnutrition called rabbit starvation
syndrome, also known as protein poisoning or
lean meat starvation. When protein provides more
than 35 percent of a personâ€˜s caloric requirement,
the liver is unable to covert the excess nitrogen to
urea, leading to nausea, diarrhea, and in extreme
cases, death (Bilsborough and Mann 2006). A
person experiencing protein poisoning would not
only feel bad but would continue to be hungry
regardless of the number of mussels consumed.
There would also be intense cravings for fat and
sugars.
Much effort was made by the aboriginal
inhabitants to harvest a food resource that
consisted mostly of inedible shell with little meat
and, without being supplemented with foods
higher in fats or carbohydrates, would still fail to
satisfy hunger. Explanations for why mussels
were consumed at the site during the period
represented by Cultural Zone 2 involve both
cultural and environmental factors.
Clearly,
mussels were available in the local streams, and
perhaps especially abundant at the confluence of
Mill Creek and the San Saba Rivers, but this alone
is not sufficient to explain the unusually high shell
number at the site. Other foods no doubt were
available in the local habitat, so for some reason
the decision was made to harvest mussels.
Questions regarding food choices made by
foraging humans are often addressed using models
borrowed from evolutionary biology, an approach

called Human Behavioral Ecology (Foley 1985,
Winterhalder 2001). The premise of behavioral
ecology is that natural selection is operating on
human behavior, favoring certain cultural
practices that enhance survivability and
reproduction within a particular ecological
context. Over time an optimal set of behaviors
will be selected from the field of all possible
behaviors, leading to a better chance of survival
over other human competitors. Its methodology is
a â€•self-consciouslyâ€– reductionist approach in that
it takes one aspect of human behavior, food
acquisition in this case, and determines which
choices maximize fitness relative to other choices
(Winterhalder 2001). Some of the first models
applied to food choices of foragers include dietbreadth, the range of foods that will be taken
when encountered, and patch choice models that
address which food patch will be selected for
harvest, and optimal harvest time before moving
on to the next.
Mussels were not randomly encountered during
most foraging forays â€“ except possibly during
fishing - but instead their harvesting was
premeditated.
Patch models are therefore
applicable to understanding how prehistoric
foragers went about deciding which mussel bed to
harvest and how long to continue there before
moving to the next mussel bed. In this study, the
mussel bed that presumably existed at the
confluence of Mill Creek and the San Saba River
can be looked at as a resource patch, existing
within a larger geographic unit call a habitat, in
this case the floodplain of the San Saba River and
its major tributaries where other mussel bed were
located (Winterhalder 2001). Mussel beds are
different from other food patches in their longer
duration compared to plant resources that may last
a few weeks. Also, mussels are not as easily
visible as other food patches, such as ripening
fruit or animal herds, and the richness of a
particular mussel bed is not easy to assess. The
potential harvester must enter a body of water and
49

feel around for the shellfish. Also, the actual size
of the shellfish bed remains unknown until the bed
is eventually depleted.
There is always
uncertainty about the productively of this resource
even long after it is first encountered.
Other food patches were present in the floodplain,
some seasonally available for harvesting such as
pecan groves and elderberry stands, while other
were potentially available at any time of the year
such as deer and other game . These resources are
ranked by their â€•profitability,â€– the amount of food
value versus the acquisition and preparation costs.
The mussel beds near 41SS178 were potentially
rich resource patches, considering the amount of
suspended nutrients, such diatoms, provided by
the two streams since mussels feed by filtering the
water for this suspended phytoplankton. Still, it
may not matter how abundant a resource was if
other, higher ranking foods were available in
sufficient numbers (Winterhalder 2001).
Shellfish are a low value food resource because
laboratory tests have shown them to be low in
calories (Parmalee and Klippel 1974). Calories or
energy optimization has often been used as a
proxy for reproductive fitness and as â€•currencyâ€–
in optimality models. The caloric value of other
foods available to hunter-gatherers in the region
rank much higher. Terrestrial animals have twice
the protein than shellfish and pecans. The
aboriginal people, through taste alone, were
probably aware of relative caloric values of most
foods. Mussels, being low in fat, satisfied hunger
less than certain other foods. They are on par
with tubers and most fruits, although they lack the
high sugar content of the latter group.
However, the profitability of mussel harvesting
can be relatively high because the costs of
gathering and preparing them are low, depending
on density and depth of the mussel beds, thus
raising their profitability (Lintz 1996). The only
equipment needed to harvest them is a net bag or

other container. Cooking mussels is a simple
process requiring only fuel and perhaps rocks to
steam the mollusks (Parmalee and Klippel 1974).
Most of the 41SS178 mussels appear to have been
steamed open since they show no evidence of
having been forced open. A small percentage of
the shells is dark gray in color and highly
fragmented, suggesting they have been burned.
These burned shells might have fallen between the
heated rocks during cooking and come into
contact with the coals.
Site 41SS178 appears ideally situated to exploit
mussels and other aquatic resources. Within a 500
meter radius, they would have had close to 3000
linear meters of streambed to harvest. Presumably
one reason they moved to the spot was to harvest
mussels, possibly because the people were
undergoing food stress. If so, then we might
expect other, lower ranked foods to be present in
the faunal assemblages at 41SS178.
This raises the problem of the small numbers of
mussel shells seen at most prehistoric sites in
central Texas. If they represent food remains,
then they only contributed a small fraction of the
food consumed at these sites. This would mean
that diet breadth was large and that a large range
of food types were being sought even when their
nutritional contribution would appear negligible.
If the early occupants of 41SS178 were
undergoing food stress and broadening their diet
to include other low-ranked foods along with
mussels, then this should be reflected in the faunal
assemblage from Cultural Zone 2. Vertebrate
animals are usually ranked by their body mass, the
larger the animal the higher its rank. If the
41SS178 foragers were harvesting mussels
because large animals were scarce, then the
animals represented by the bones in Cultural Zone
2 should be dominated by smaller species
reflecting an increased diet breath compared to
that of Cultural Zone 1.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Figure 28 shows the bone weight separated by
animal size plotted against depth. Bone weight
for large and very large animals peaks in the
deposits above the mussel shell lens (Cultural
Zone 1). Weights of these bones drop in the level
of the shell lens, with very large animal bone
falling to near zero.
Bone weights for these
animal sizes rises again in the deposits below the
shell lens where disturbances were most evident,
particularly in Unit 2. From this, it can be
inferred that few if any very large animals (i.e.,
bison) were being consumed at the site during the
formation of Cultural Zone 2, but were definitely
part of the diet, and perhaps an important one,
during the late occupations represent by Cultural
Zone 1.
Deer-size animals were probably
consumed during both periods, but substantially
more so in the upper cultural zone. It is also
possible that all the large animal bone in Cultural
Zone 2 migrated down from the upper deposits
where large animal bones were densest.
If mostly low-valued foods were being consumed
during the formation of Cultural Zone 2, then we

would expect the amount of small animal bone to
be relatively large within that zone. Also, if diet
breadth was narrower during the formation of
Cultural Zone 1, then that zone should have a
significantly higher bone count for the larger
animal species than Cultural Zone 2. As the
Figure 28 graph shows, small animal bone weight
does peak in Cultural Zone 2, with a similar peak
well below the cultural deposits and a slightly
smaller peak in Cultural Zone 1. Interestingly, at
the elevation of the shell lens, bone count for all
species is lowest than at any elevation within the
cultural deposits, with the exception of deer-sized
animals. The unexpectedly high bone weight for
large animals in the shell lens can be accounted
for by two relatively large bone fragments that
skew the numbers. Clearly large and very large
animal bone peaks in Cultural Zone 1.
The data suggest that exploitation of deer and
bison size animals was more common during
Cultural Zone 1, which formed at least in part
through the activities of people who possessed
Toyah cultural traits, than during the earlier period

of occupation. It is unclear if significant numbers
of other animals were consumed at the site when
mussels where being intensely harvested. Animal
bone occurs in relatively low amounts in the level
with the densest mussel shell. In Unit 3, where
the shell lens is best preserved, only very small
fragments of bone were recovered within the
feature. These represent both small animals â€“
birds, rabbit-size mammals â€“ and deer-size
mammals. From the faunal data, it can be inferred
that few vertebrates were being taken when the
mussel shell lens was accumulating and that
mussels were the principal animal food, perhaps
supplemented by a few birds and mammals.
However, most of these species are low in fat and
would do little to solve the problem of protein
poisoning discussed earlier.

Mussel Species at 41SS178

part of the analyzed sample, one Yellow Sandshell
(Lampsilis teres) was noted in the mussel valves
recovered from another unit (see Figure 29 and
Figure 30). Because most of the mussel shells
appear to have originally been deposited in a
single lens and then vertically dispersed in the
deposits by bioturbation, no obvious differences
in the proportions of these species are expected
from level to level. This appears to be the case as
is shown in the Figure 31 graph, with relatively
high numbers of all species in Levels 3, 4, and 5,
which corresponds to the Mussel shell lens
(Feature 1), and a second smaller but
proportionate rise for all species in Levels 8, 9,
10. No unusually heavy disturbances were noted
for these levels in the south half of Unit 2, where
the mussel shell sample was taken but their
species proportion is similar to that of Cultural
Zone 2 and suggests that most, if not all, these
shells migrated downwards.
Central Texas Pimplebacks

At least six species of freshwater mussels were
recovered during the test excavations (Figure 29
and Figure 30). The majority of the shells (52
percent of all valves in the analyzed sample)
belong either to the Texas Pimplebacks (Quadrula
petrina)
or
Smooth
Pimplebacks
(Q.
houstonensis). Because these closely related
species are difficult to distinguish from one
another in their eroded condition, Howells
(personal communication) suggests they be
grouped in this report under the term Central
Texas Pimplebacks. The other mussel species in
the analyzed sample, listed in descending order,
are Threeridges (Amblema plicata) at 29 percent,
Southern Mapleleafs (Quadrula apiculata) at 2.1
percent, Pistolgrips
(Quadrula verrucosa,
formally Tritogonia verrucosa) 1.5percent and,
and False Spike (Quadrula mitchelli, formally
Quincuncina mitchelli) at 0.5 percent. Another 15
percent of the valve sample could not be
identified, primarily because of the eroded or
fragmented condition of the shells. Although not

The shell shapes of both the Texas Pimplebacks
and Smooth Pimplebacks are very similar,
differing slightly in proportions and in some
minor disk sculpturing. In a slightly eroded
condition the two species can be difficult to
distinguish. Their historic range is thought to
overlap in the lower reaches of the San Saba
where 41SS178 is located (Howells 2002).
Knowing which species of Central Texas
Pimpleback occurs at 41SS178 has cultural
relevance for determining size bias during
harvesting in that Q. petrina is larger, adult shell
length averaging from 60 to 90 mm, while that of
Q. houstonensis averages from 45 to 60 mm.
Both species have seen dramatic reductions in
their ranges in the last century. One reason for this
might have been the overgrazing that occurred in
latter half of the 19th century, particularly on the
Edwards Plateau, causing increased rain runoff
into the streams and scouring of the stream
bottoms (Howells, personal communication). At

present, Texas Pimplebacks are found in the
Colorado River drainage north of Lake Buchanan.
The damming of the Colorado River for the
Highland Lakes may have extirpated them from
southern half of their former range in part because
this particular species does not do well in
impoundments. Smooth Pimplebacks are no
longer found in the Colorado River drainage
except near the coast. Their present range is
primarily restricted to the middle Brazos River
drainage.
Texas Pimplebacks tend to be
proportionally longer and less inflated than
Smooth Pimplebacks. Howells (2002) gives the
means and ranges for the proportions of shell
height to shell length and shell width to shell
length for both species. Forty-five percent of the
Central Texas Pimplebacks from 41SS178 sample
have height to length ratios that fall within the
range for the Texas Pimpleback, and 46 percent of
the shells fall within the range for Smooth
Pimpleback. Nine percent of the shells fall outside

the range of both species, being nearly round in
shape. The percentage of shell width to shell
length demonstrates the degree of shell inflation.
Nearly 31 percent of the shells fall within the
range of Texas Pimplebacks and 64 percent within
the range for Smooth Pimplebacks. Five percent
of the shells fall outside the typical ranges for
both species.
From these data, it appears that both the Texas
Pimpleback and Smooth Pimpleback are
represented in the collection. However, many of
these Central Texas Pimplebacks appear to have a
series of parallel ridges on the posterior slopes,
which are seen mainly on Texas Pimplebacks
(Howells 2002). Because of the eroded surface of
the shells, these ridges are indistinct and their
actual presence uncertain. The mussel shells from
the 41SS178 sample referred to here as Central
Texas Pimplebacks could be composed of all

Figure 31. Line chart showing how mussel species frequencies vary with depth in Unit 2 South.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
Texas Pimplebacks, all Smooth Pimplebacks, or
both species. These two species do not hybridize
(Howells, personal communication).
Cultural bias
Looking at published data from archeological sites
in north-central and east central Texas,
Threeridges and Central Texas Pimplebacks make
up the bulk (96 percent) of all the identifiable
mussel valves, with smaller percentages of other
species (Howells et al. 2003, Mauldin et al. 2003).
Even though different cultural groups inhabited
these sites â€“ with presumably different cultural
biases â€“ the fact that the most common harvested
species are the same would suggest that in the
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods,
Threeridges and Central Texas Pimplebacks were
indeed the most common species in the middle
Colorado and Brazos River drainages. One caveat
to this statement is that both these species have
thick shells and are more likely to be preserved in
archeological
sites
(Howells
personal
communication).
Threeridges are one of the most common species
at 41SS178, comprising 29 percent of the mussel
sample from the test excavations.
Because
Threeridges are on average over twice the shell
volume of the siteâ€˜s Central Texas Pimplebacks
(Table 6), they provided most of the mussel meat
consumed. Threeridges represent one of the most
common mussel species recovered from
archeological sites within the Colorado and
Brazos River systems and were probably present
in large numbers in the lower San Saba River and
its tributaries during the Late Holocene. Despite
its economic value in the shell-button industry,
this species remains common today and, unlike
the Central Texas Pimplebacks, is not considered
threatened. One reason for this is its ability to
tolerate poor water conditions relative to other
mussel species. One way of answering the
question of cultural bias would be to compare the

archeological samples from 41SS178 to early
historic records of the kinds and frequencies of
mussel species found in the San Saba River
system, as was done by Peacock (2000) in
Mississippi. Unfortunately, little data from early
or even recent times exits. While museum
specimens are known (Winemiller 2010), the
lower San Saba River remains poorly surveyed
(Howells, personal communication). Even if good
modern day records were available, it would still
probably be impossible to know if the foragers at
41SS178 were favoring particular species for
harvest and rejecting others. Ideally, a researcher
would need to know the composition of the
mussel beds at the confluence of Mill Creek and
the San Saba River as it was 1,000 years ago.
That said, there is nothing unusual about the
41SS178 mussel species assemblage and it is
probably representative what was found in the
areaâ€˜s streams during the Late Prehistoric.
At 41SS178, most mussels were presumably
harvested from mussel beds present in Mill Creek,
a narrow, spring-fed stream that loops around the
site on three sides. Since mussels could be
transported in net bags or other containers, some
of the 41SS178 mussels could also have come
from beds in nearby stretches of the San Saba
River. In fact, the site is well-positioned for
exploiting mussels from a variety of streambed
habitats. Within 500 meters of the site there are
close to 3000 linear meters of stream bed, varying
from about one to 10 meters in width. Depth also
varies from quite shallow to several meters deep
in holes in the river. The stream bottoms consist
of mud, silts, and sand, substrates that support a
wide number of unionid species. In general,
heavier shelled species prefer firmer bottom
conditions, since they would sink deep into soft
mud. The thinner shelled types can remain
suspended in soft substrate and still be able to
filter feed. Nearly all the species from the
41SS178 sample, with the exception of the few
False Spikes and Yellow Sandshells, have heavy
55

shells and would prefer the firmer substrates
provided by the areaâ€˜s streams.

Mussel Shell Size at 41SS178
Mussels recovered from prehistoric sites in the
Southeastern United States tend to be small in size
compared to modern specimens of the same
species (Peacock 2000). This includes specimens
collected from archeological sites in Texas as well
(Howells et al. 2003, Randklev 2009). The
41SS178 mussel shells appear to follow this trend
in that the average size of each species falls well
below their present day adult size (see Table 6).
Explanations for the small size of mussels in
archeological contexts include cultural bias
because of taste or texture (shell size correlates
positively with age), overharvesting, and
harvesting practices (smaller mussels inhabit
shallower water and were easier to collect).
Howells (personal communication) states that
while both large and small mussels can be found
in shallow water, the smaller ones tend to occur in
larger numbers in part because smaller mussels
are active and will move into shallow areas that
were previously dry, whereas large individuals
tend to stay put in areas that do not go dry as
often.
Overexploitation by aboriginal harvesters is
sometimes cited as a possible reason for the small
sizes of mussel shell collected from archeological
sites. Peacock (2000) feels that this is an unlikely
cause since many modern mussel populations
have also been heavily exploited. However,
harvesting practices by prehistoric North
Americans must have differed considerably from
those used in modern times. For example,
sustained harvesting of a particular mussel bed
may prevent individuals from reaching full size.
Environmental explanations for the diminutive
size of archeological mussels have also been

proposed. Mussels are filter feeders and stream
current velocity, volume, and depth all play a role
mussel growth patterns. The small size of central
Texas streams could be a factor in inhibiting
mussel growth. Modern land-use practices may
have inadvertently led to increased mussel
growth. For example, clearing vegetation from
creek banks allowed more sunlight to reach the
water and thus increased water temperature
(Peacock 2000).
While the 41SS178 mussels are considerably
smaller than present-day adult specimens,
individuals in the area streams could reach a very
large size during the prehistoric period. A
Threeridge valve recovered from a shovel test in
the neighboring site 41SSS177 had a length of
188 mm, the maximum size known for this
species in Texas (Howells et al. 1996). This
specimen came from near the surface, so it could
possibly belong to the historic (early 20th century)
component of 41SS177.
However, another
slightly smaller Threeridge valve was recovered
from the same shovel test from a depth of between
20 and 40 cm along with many smaller valves in
deposits that probably date to the Late Prehistoric,
based on diagnostic artifacts recovered from other
shovel tests at the site.
In the 41SS178 mussel sample, most Threeridges
measure between 31.3 and 55.2 mm shell length
(one standard deviation) with the smallest being
23.4 mm and the largest being 81.1 mm (Figure
32). The average shell length of the 41SS178
sample is less than a third that of a full grown
Threeridge (Howells et al. 1996). Threeridges in
Ohio have been reported to reach sexual maturity
at a shell length of 52 mm (Howells et al. 1996).
If this is true for Texas Threeridges as well, then
only 7 of the 31 measurable specimens in the
sample reached this stage. The Central Texas
Pimplebacks were mostly harvested between 26.0
and 37.2 mm (one standard deviation) in shell
length 26.0 to 37.2 mm, with the smallest being

21.3 mm and the largest being 53.3 mm (Figure
33). Even if the 41SS178 specimens represent
mostly Smooth Pimplebacks, the smaller of the
two Central Texas Pimpleback species, their shell
lengths still fall below the present-day size range
of 45 to 65 mm and are considerably smaller than
60 to 90 mm for adult Texas Pimpleback
specimens (Howells 2002).
If size were indeed the main criterion for selecting
or rejecting a particular mussel, then it would be
expected that any mussel regardless of species
would be taken up to an absolute, culturally
prescribed size. In the 41SS178 sample, Central
Texas Pimplebacks occur up to a maximum shell
length of 37.2 mm with a few taken up 53.3 mm,
whereas Threeridges were commonly harvested
up to a shell length of 55.2 mm and up to 81.1 mm
in a few cases. It appears from these data that
Central Texas Pimplebacks were rarely available
in sizes above 37.5 mm. Otherwise, they would
have been taken to lengths of 55.2 mm if that was
the culturally prescribed maximum shell length
for harvesting mussels. Apparently all the Central
Texas Pimplebacks were being taken within a
particular harvesting area and that their numbers
decreased sharply above a shell length of 37.5

mm. Possibly all Threeridges were being taken
when encountered, and few of those were above a
length of 55.2 mm.
The length of a full grown Texas Pimpleback
measures between 60 and 90 mm, but some of the
larger specimens do overlap the size range for an
adult Smooth Pimpleback, which reaches lengths
of between 45 and 65 mm (Howells 2002).
An explanation for the lower end of the mussel
size in the sample is easier to come by. Small
mussels are difficult to find in streambed sediment
(Howells, personal communication). This might
account for absence of shells less than 21 mm in
length. Another factor may be the container used
to hold them while harvesting, most likely this
was a net bag. The average mesh width for net
bags from a sample recovered from Val Verde
County cave sites is around 18 mm (Schuetz
1963).

histograms for Central Texas Pimplebacks in 41SS178
sample.

Previous studies indicate no obvious preference
regarding the size of mussel being harvested.
Peacock (2000) saw no obvious size bias in
mussel shell assemblages from a Late Woodland
site in Mississippi. Using similar methods,
57

Randklev et al. (2009) came to the same
conclusion for Late Archaic sites in north Texas.
Both used histograms to show that size
distributions of their respective samples are
similar to what would be expected of a healthy
recruiting population. Such histograms show a
gradual rise in the number of specimens as size
category increases and then after reaching a
certain maximum abruptly drops off with a few
exceptionally large individuals (Figure 34).
Healthy, recruiting populations have this
histogram shape because mussels grow rapidly
early in life and then once reaching adult size,
growth slows considerably.
Histograms for Threeridges (see Figure 32) and
Central Texas Pimplebacks (see Figure 33) in the

Figure 34. Bar chart showing size distribution of Central
Texas Pimplebacks in 41SS178 sample (blue) and the
expected distribution of modern recruiting population.

41SS178 sample seem to show a curve that is
reverse to that of a recruiting population, with a
steep increase in frequency with increasing length
up to 37.2 cm followed by a gradual decline in
frequency. Part of the problem with the analyzed
sample is that the maximum size for each species
is so small that smaller mussels simply would not
be likely to be harvested for the reasons stated
earlier, creating the steep rise in the histograms.
For example, the Threeridges from one of the
North Texas sites (41HI115) have their maximum
representation in a size category (80.0 â€“ 83.3 mm)
twice that of the 41SS178 sample (40.0-44.9mm).
Because the streams around 41SS178 are small
with fewer nutrients, it would be expected that the
mussels would tend to be smaller. Sustained
harvesting of mussels by aboriginal groups must
also be considered a major factor in the small size
in light of the fact that very large individuals have
been recovered from an adjacent prehistoric site,
41SS177. The way unionid mussels reproduce
means that few if any of the mussels in a
particular bed need to reach sexual maturity for
that bed to continue recruitment. Juveniles
resulting from spawning elsewhere in the river
system will continue to be released over the
harvested mussel bed by the host fish.
Hypothetically, an initial episode of mussel
harvesting of a particular bed could remove most
mussels with shell lengths greater than 25 mm.
Thereafter, harvesting could take place at two year
intervals, creating the size range seen in the
41SS178 sample. This is because growth is rapid
in juveniles, perhaps around six millimeters per
year in Threeridges and Central Texas
Pimplebacks (Howells et al. 1996), and a mussel
considered too small at a shell length of 23 mm
would after two years be close to 39 mm in
length, about the average size for all mussels in
the sample. Of course, the interval between
harvestings doesnâ€˜t have to always be two years â€“
it could vary between one to three years â€“ but the

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
average interval would be around two years for
the size range seen in the 41SS178 sample.
Why would mussels be harvested at an average of
every two years, since waiting longer between
harvests would allow mussels reach a larger
average size and increase productivity? Pecans
are another food source in the same habitat that
has a biennial production cycle, bearing large
crops one year with low yields the next year.
Biennial production is common in fruit bearing
trees but is severe in pecans because the fruit (nut)
matures late in the growing leaving little time for
storing carbohydrates for next yearâ€˜s crop
(University of Georgia 2010).
Aboriginal
foragers no doubt relied heavily on the abundant
pecan groves in the San Saba floodplain. When
pecan crops failed, often every other year, there
would have to be an alternative food source in
mussels to fall back on. Still, overreliance on this
low fat food for extended periods of time would
lead to rabbit starvation syndrome causing
sickness, death, at the very least continued
feelings of hunger. Calories from some other
food sources high in carbohydrates or fats would
be needed in order to remain healthy (Bilsborough
and Mann 2006).

Texas Hill Country were probably too small to
support sustained harvesting, or even brief but
intensive harvesting on a yearly basis. However,
in times of severe food stress they could be relied
on until other foods became available. Despite
the problem of protein poisoning, the
archeological record at 41SS178 and other sites
shows that during certain times freshwater
mussels were harvested and eaten in large
numbers, relieving hunger (at least initially) and
potentially sustaining small populations for longer
periods when supplemented with foods having a
higher fat or carbohydrate content.

Modified Mussel Shell
Eleven mussel shells recovered during the testing
were found to be perforated, all from Cultural
Zone 2 or slightly below. This represents a very
small percentage â€“ about 0.33 percent -- of the
total shell count of 2,955 valves or umbos. For
the most part, the perforations occur in the umbo
portion of the shell, although in one shell the
perforation occurred in the posterior slope (Figure

If it could be shown that the season of death for
the majority of 41SS178 mussels occurred in fall
and early winter, it would obviously lend support
to theory that mussel harvesting was a wellingrained fallback strategy when pecan crops
were unproductive. While mussel growth ring
analysis have been useful in determining
seasonality from shell samples in regions where
summer and winter seasons are more
pronounced, in central Texas, where winters are
mild, drought and other unpredictable factors
may be more influential to growth patterns than
the conventional seasons (Howells 1996).
The mussel beds in the streams near 41SS178
and perhaps in most of the braided streams of the

35). Six of the holes were circular or nearly so,
varying in width from 2 to 6 mm with an average
of 4.2 mm. The other holes were irregular, some
appearing as two holes adjacent to one another.
The smallest dimension of these irregular holes
averages to nearly the same as the circular holes at
4.25 mm. The holes appear to be smaller on the
interior and larger and jagged on the exterior,
suggesting that they were struck by some sharp
pointed object from the interior. However, a more
plausible explanation is that a small portion of the
exterior umbo was planed off, exposing the
interior of the shell. Therefore, it is possible that
some of these holes were created unknowingly by
the archeologists while scraping with trowels or
shovels during the test excavations.
Replication studies will be needed to see if
scraping with a trowel can indeed create this kind
of perforation. However, I have seen mussel
valves from surface collections of nonexcavated
sites, such as 41TV250 on Lake Travis in Travis
County, that have similar perforations, so other
factors, perhaps including prehistoric cultural
practices, could be involved. Additionally, the
perforated shells recovered from the 41SS178
testing cluster in two discrete areas: Unit 2 North
in levels 5 and 6, and Unit 3 in levels 3, 4, and 5,
suggesting that they were used in groups of five or
six valves (Table 4). If troweling or shovel

Summary
Freshwater mussels are a highly visible
component of the faunal material at 41SS178.
Based on the associated diagnostic artifacts and a
radiocarbon age of AD 1040 to 1260 (Beta 287767, 2 sigma calibration) from charcoal within
the shell midden, most of shells accumulated
during the Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric
Period. The site could contain the remains of over
600,000 mussels if the densities seen in the tested
area are representative of the entire mussel shell
feature. However, their small size â€“ on average
about a third of the size of their respective species
today â€“ meant that the quantity of available meat
was low. Since mussel meat is lean, additional
calories from fats or carbohydrates would have
been needed to prevent rabbit starvation. These
nutrients may have been provided by nuts, but if
the pecan crop was abundant, low-valued foods
such as mussels probably would have been
eschewed altogether. Fats could also have been
provided by the other animal species whose bones
were recovered from within the shell lens,
including a few bones from deer-size animals as
well as a few bones from small animals, such as
duck-size birds and rabbit-size mammals. More
telling is the highly fragmented condition of the
bones indicating that efforts were made to extract
as much nutrients from the animals as possible.
This suggests that the resident population was
undergoing food stress.

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178

Chapter 9. Summary
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl
The test excavations show that the 41SS178
terrace was occupied during the Late Prehistoric
Period, perhaps when aggradation of this
landform slowed due to less overbank flooding in
the San Saba River/Mill Creek confluence area.
During the earliest occupations, an approximately
20 cm thick lens of mussel shells accumulated
over the site area, probably discarded by
aboriginal people who harvested these mollusks
from the surrounding streams and cooked them
for food on hot rocks. The shell lens and its
associated artifacts and other features were
defined as Cultural Zone 2 at the site. A probable
Scallorn arrow point, several triangular arrow
point performs, and a radiocarbon date with a 2
Sigma Calibration range of AD 1040 to 1260
(Beta 287767) recovered from the shell lens ties
Cultural Zone 2 to the Austin Phase of the Late
Prehistoric Period.
Directly overlying the shell lens is a thin cultural
zone of 10 to 15 cm thickness that contains
relatively more bone fragments but fewer mussel
shells and burned rocks. This cultural zone,
which was designated as Cultural Zone 1, also
contains a small sample of Perdiz points, end
scrapers, and bone-tempered pottery sherds, all of
which are traits of the Toyah Phase culture of the
Late Prehistoric.
However, this zone also
contains several edge-damaged, side- and cornernotched arrow points that are most likely of the
Scallorn type. Unless these side- and cornernotched points represent some as yet unidentified
type post-dating the Austin Phase, their presence
alongside the Toyah Phase diagnostics is an
indication of some mixing of Austin and Toyah
Phase materials. That Cultural Zone 1 is mixed
would not be surprising considering the relative
thinness of the deposit and slow aggradation of
the terrace sediments.

The mussels were potentially a major food item
for the Austin Phase occupants within the tested
area at 41SS178, although large numbers would
be needed to satisfy caloric needs since the size of
the mussels was small. The small size of the
mussels, one-third to one-half the size of modern
mussels, may be the result of intense harvesting at
two-year intervals when all mussels over 2.5 cm
in length were taken. This minimum size may
reflect the mesh size of the net bag used to store
the mussels during harvesting. A two year respite
from harvesting would allow the surviving
mussels to grow another 1.4 cm on average, which
would put the larger individuals within the
harvesting size range.
Exploitation of these small mollusks with low
caloric value suggests that other, more
nutritionally rich foods were not available in
sufficient quantities. Some higher-ranking animal
foods were taken during the accumulation of the
shells, including a few deer, along with some
smaller mammals and birds, which would be
expected if diet breadth was wide. Perhaps the
highest ranking food source in terms of fats and
calories within the floodplain habitat is the pecan.
Although no direct evidence of pecan
consumption was found during the test
excavations, scheduled visits to the pecan groves
to harvest this food source were probably wellingrained in the aboriginal settlement and
subsistence patterns.
Unfortunately for the
aboriginal foragers, pecan trees are strongly
biennially bearing, producing abundant pecan
crops one year and little or none the next. During
an off year, foragers could still schedule their fall
visits to the pecan groves in the 41SS178 vicinity
by relying heavily on mussels in combination with
other available foods with a higher fat or
carbohydrate content. This strategy would work
since mussel harvesting was periodic and allowed
a sizable population to reach harvesting size.
Many Toyah components across central Texas
show evidence of bison exploitation, e.g., Creel
67

(1990) and Quigg (1995). The 41SS178 Toyah
faunal assemblage appears to follow this trend.
By weight, 44 percent of the bone from Cultural
Zone 1 is from bison compared to 21 percent for
the Cultural Zone 2 component. The influx of
bison after AD 1260 provided a new and major
food source at 41SS178 that may have led to a deemphasis of mussel harvesting and perhaps less
reliance on pecans as a high-fat food source.
However, it is not certain that this pattern applies
to the broader central Texas area or throughout the
entire period from AD 1250 to 1700, when Toyah
material culture dominated the region.
The test excavations show that the 41SS178
sediments harbor features, including the shell lens
mentioned above and a burned rock cluster that
may represent a disturbed hearth. Portions of the
shell lens appear to be well preserved with distinct
clumps of mussel valves discernable. The shell
lens also has numerous charcoal particles within
it, one of which was used for the radiocarbon date
mentioned above. The shells occur in numbers
more than sufficient for meaningful research.
This could also be said for animal bones as well,
which happen to be in a good state of
preservation.
Because of the poor separation of the Late
Prehistoric components in the tested area of
41SS178, additional excavation there would add
little to the knowledge base of this site. However,
this tested area represents only a small part of the
site and separation of these components may be
greater elsewhere. Also, 41SS178 may be related
to 41SS177, which lies immediately to the south,
especially since Toyah phase ceramics and lithics
have been found at the north end of 41SS177.

Appendix 2. Analysis of Vertebrate
Faunal Remains from 41SS178
By Barbara A. Meissner

A total of 329 bones, weighing 334.80 g, were
recovered during the project (see Table 2.1). Of
these, 265 (80.5 percent) could be identified only
as mammal bone. Only 16 bones (4.9 percent)
could be identified to the genus taxonomic level,
however these 16 bones represented eight genera.
The collection studied for this report was
encountered during two phases of the project at
41SS178. In the beginning, two backhoe trenches
were dug (see Chapter 3), though bone was only
recovered in Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1. A total of
40 bones, weighing 143.98 g were recovered from
BHT 1. Table 2.2 lists the bone recovered during
this part of the project.
In a later phase of the project, three 1 x 2 m units
were hand excavated (see Chapter 4). A total of
283 bones, weighing 190.82 g were recovered
from the hand-dug units (Table 2.2). This report
will focus on the bones recovered during the
hand-dug excavations.
Methodology
The bone had been washed and labeled and was
bagged by provenience at the time it arrived for
analysis. The bones were identified to the most
specific taxon possible, using the comparative
collection at the Center for Archaeological
Research, the University of Texas at San Antonio,
as well as several standard reference texts
(Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992; Boessneck 1970;
Gilbert et al. 1981; Gilbert 1990; Hildebrand
1955; Hillson 1986; Olsen 1960, 1980; Schmid
1972; Sobolik and Steele 1996). The authority for
the taxonomic nomenclature used in this report is

the Integrated Taxonomic Information System
(ITIS 2010). Identifications were conservative.
For instance, bone that appeared to be bison-sized
was not identified as Bison bison unless it could
be differentiated from cattle (Bos taurus) and
horses (Equus caballos). When a mammal or bird
bone could not be identified to at least the Order
taxonomic level, it was classified by the apparent
size of the animal, if possible, as shown in Table
2.4.
After examination, the bone was placed in 4-mil
archival-quality ziplock plastic bags by taxon,
with a printed tag on acid-free paper, listing lot
number, provenience, taxon, count, and weight.
This tag was placed inside a smaller bag to
separate it from the faunal material. The taxon
bags were then placed in larger bags by lot
number and returned to LCRA for curation. The
collection will be housed permanently at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin.
Data Collected
Data collected from this collection varied
depending on the specificity of the identified
taxon and on the size of the bone. Table 2.3 lists
the types of data collected for each category of
bone. Data collected from all bone included taxon,
count, weight, and evidence of exposure to heat. If
the bone in question was large enough (generally
at least 2 cm in largest dimension) evidence of
chemical and/or atmospheric weathering was
noted. Data collected for bones identified to at
least the Order taxonomic level included all the
data described above as well as element, portion
of element, butcher marks, evidence of
immaturity, evidence of animal gnawing,
evidence of any pathologies. When bones in a
single provenience appeared to have been broken
during excavation and could be mended they were
counted as a single bone. A list of definitions and

Archeological Test Excavations at 41SS178
coding precedes the list of all data recovered from
these bones in Table 2.5. Although elements,
portion of elements, and side are listed in the
complete data set listed in Table 2.6, the nature of
the very small collection scattered over more than
10 meters makes the determination of Minimum
Number of Individuals (MNI) of little value.
Because MNI is of most use when used in
collections of limited scope, such as the contents
of a feature or other temporally well-delineated
context (Grayson 1984:94), a combination of the
Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) and bone
weight is considered the best technique to
estimate the relative importance to the diet of the
inhabitants of 41SS178 represented by the bones
of this collection.
Results

Table 2.1 lists all bone, with common names,
counts and weights analyzed for this report. With
the exception of the bison (Bison bison) and
probably the javelina (Pecari tajacu), all
identified animals may be encountered in
undeveloped or semi-developed areas in San Saba
County today. Bison was completely extirpated
from Texas in the past, though today there are a
few small herds that have been reintroduced in
recent decades. Javelinas are much more likely to
be found today further to the south and west of
San Saba County, though they were part of the
natural animal population in the past. (Davis and
Schmidly 1994:269).
The bone in this sample was highly fragmented,
with an average bone weight of only one gram,
but was otherwise in moderate to fair condition.
Virtually every piece that was large enough for a
determination to be made showed evidence of
slight to moderate chemical weathering (see Table
2.5). This degree of chemical weathering can be
considered normal for areas of Texas that do not
have acidic soils. Although acidic soils do

damage bone, the type of chemical weathering
seen on this bone is caused by microbiological
activity, which is more prevalent in relatively
alkaline soils.
In addition, a small number (n=8), including the
single identified bison bone, showed evidence of
slight to moderate atmospheric weathering, caused
by exposure to sunlight and wetting and drying
cycles before the bone was buried (see Table 2.6).
This is evidence that some of the bone lay on the
ground surface for some time before burial, which
probably happened as a result of fluvial processes
or during overbank flooding.
Due to the small sample size and the degree of
fragmentation, the amount of evidence of
butchering on some of the bone is a little unusual.
The turkey bones (Meleagris gallopavo) in
particular showed evidence of meat and/or
tendons being sliced off the bone with stone tools.
The tarsometatarsus, a part of the lower leg, of
one turkey had been chopped in two places. The
shaft of a tibiotarsus, also a part of the lower leg,
of a turkey was sliced open along the long axis,
opening the medulary cavity. The latter was
clearly done with a stone tool. The tibia of a
javelina (Pecari tajacu) was also sliced open in a
similar fashion (Figure 2.1). The remaining

butcher marks were made on bone that could be
identified only as belonging to a very large bison
or cow-sized animal. In both cases, impact scars
were present. Thin cuts were visible on one of
these bones, and a possible cut was seen on the
other.
Thirty-nine bones showed evidence of burning, of
which 32 (82.1 percent) showed only charring of
the bone. The small number of burned bones
(11.9 percent) and the large proportion of burned
bone that had only limited charring suggests that
bone was not deliberately disposed of in a fire,
and such burning as there was was incidental.
The possible exception to this is the distal end of a
Whitetail Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) radius,
which was thoroughly charred throughout with
little sign of calcining, suggesting that the bone
was burned during cooking of the meat still
attached to the bone.
Because the sample size of identified animal is so
small, very little can be said with confidence
about the meat diet at the site. It is somewhat
remarkable that the only fish bone was a large
otolith from a Freshwater Drum (Aplodinotus
grunniens), and even this may have been brought
to the site as a curiosity, given the lack of any
other fish bone present at the site. The relatively
small number of turtles is also somewhat
surprising given the nearness of the creek and the
use of the mussels.
In order to get a rough idea of the relative
importance of variously sized vertebrates to the
diet at the site, all mammals and birds whose size
could be determined (including those that had
been identified) were divided into four categories:
1) very large; 2) large; 3) medium; and 4) small.
In addition, all turtles and all fish were combined.
The bones from BHT 1 were not included in
Table 2.4. Table 2.4 clearly shows a reliance
largely on deer-sized and bison-sized animals.
Bone weight for these animals was 84.5 percent of
the bones included in Table 2.4. In addition,

birds, especially turkey-sized birds, provide a
respectable percentage of the bone weight.
Invertebrate animals, especially freshwater
mussels, are known to have added to the menu at
the site. The complete lack of rat-sized animals is
a surprise here, as is the near absence of fish. The
relatively small amount of bone, at least in the
areas excavated, suggests a fairly short-term
occupation, and the presence of significant
amounts of both bison and deer-sized bones, and
the presence of turkey in significant amounts
suggests that both fish and rat-sized animals were
not worth the effort of collecting them at the time
the site was inhabited. It is important to consider
the above with considerable reserve, however, as
the collection analyzed for this project was quite
small, and the amount of bone and other dietary
evidence that might still lie buried at the site is
unknown.

Authorâ€™s note:
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Dr. Steve Tomka, director of
the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of
the University of Texas at San Antonio, for his
support for this project, and in particular for
allowing the use of the comparative collection at
CAR.

Table 2.5. List of definitions and coding.
Juvenile
There were no bones showing evidence of immaturity at the time of death. This may be due to the very
fragmented nature of most of the collection.
Burned
Exposure to heat, either to very high temperatures or long exposure or both, causing partial (charring)
or complete (calcination) oxidation of the carbon component of the bone (Lyman 1994:384). Partial
burning of a bone is sometimes considered evidence of roasting, but experiments by David (1990)
indicated that roasting did not result in calcining, indicating that cooking is rarely the cause of calcining
in bone, and it is more likely that calcined bone was thrown into a fire as a disposal method, or, in rare
occasions, used as part of the fuel for the fire (Meissner 2004:96).

Stage 1, Charred: At least some portion of the bone is blackened
Stage 2, Partially calcined: Most of the bone is blackened and part of the bone is showing
the white, tan, or brown colorations of calcination
Stage 3, Calcined: Bone is completely white, tan, or brown indicating a long period of
heating at high temperatures.
Weathering
Weathering is a term used to describe destruction of bone by natural agents after deposition, including
rapid wetting and drying on the ground surface as well as diagenetic factors such as leaching as a result
of soil chemistry and/or biological agents in the soil (Lyman 1994:354-375). Weathering will be
divided into two basic types here, chemical and atmospheric.

Chemical weathering: Chemical weathering is caused by acid etching by bacteria, and/or fungi
during the process of ingestion of the bone. Most common in mild to moderately alkaline soils,
chemical weathering appears as a series of tiny, shallow, flat or cup-shaped depressions in the bone.
Stage 1: Scattered shallow pits over surface of bone. Original bone surface largely intact.
Stage 2: Many shallow pits, sometime overlapping each other, creating a roughened texture
to the bone, with little of the original bone surface unaffected.
Stage 3: Original bone surface is completely obliterated, pits are covering next layer of
bone, often created a â€•chewedâ€– look to the bone.
Atmospheric Weathering: This form of weathering is caused by the bleaching effects of direct
sunlight on the bone surface and by the effects of rapid wetting and drying during rain events. It is
almost always confined to a single side of the bone and the extent will depend on the degree to which
the bone is unburied.
Stage 1: Bone surface slightly bleached, very slightly roughened, showing tiny shallow
cracks.
Stage 2: Bone surface somewhat roughened, cracks more numerous and deeper.

87

Stage 3: Bone rough, cracks are large and deep, sometimes all the way through to medulary
cavity, some splintering is occurring. Bone surface is beginning to exfoliate.
Stage 4: Cracks are large and splintering. The remainder of the bone surface has
completely exfoliated.
Butchering
None of the butcher marks seen in this collection appeared to be made with metal tools
Thin Cut: Narrow cut that does little more than scratch the bone surface
Thick Cut: Deeper and thicker cut, but does not reach medulary cavity
Chop: Thick heavy cut that at a minimum reaches the medulary cavity (or equivalent) and
may completely sever the bone
Impact scar: Usually somewhat rounded area where bone is crushed and breaks on inner
side of compact bone are beveled indicating blow to a narrow area of bone.

Pathologies
No pathologies were noted in this collection
Animal gnawing
Canid: Evidence the bone was chewed on by coyote-sized carnivore
Small Carnivore: Evidence of skunk-size chewing
Rodent: Evidence bone was chewed on by rodents

Appendix 4. Snails from 41SS178
by Andrew F. Malof
A total of 104 snail shells from the excavation
units were analyzed from 111 shells that had been
collected. Following analysis, during which very
small fragments were discarded, the final shell
total was 105 specimens, with a single
unidentifiable shell fragment (Table 4.1).
Once the shells were identified as to genus or
species using standard reference texts and a
comparative collection, they were coded to
correspond, as closely as possible, with the two
identified cultural zones, between elevations of
99.80 and 99.30, and the noncultural zones, at
elevations above and/or below, depending upon
unit (Table 4.2).
Of the 104 identifiable shells, 63 (61 percent),
were Rabdotus species snails. Members of the
family Polygyridae (N=38) made up 37 percent of
the total. There were two nonnative Rumina
decollata in the very upper portion of Unit 3, and
a freshwater Elimia comalensis between 99.20
and 99.30 in Unit 2.

There were 20 identifiable snails in each of the
two cultural zones. Cultural Zone 1 had only
Polygyridae, with 15 (75 percent) of those
members of the Polygyra genus. Cultural Zone 2
contained 14 (70 percent) Rabdotus and the
remainder were Polygyridae.
Of the 64 remaining noncultural-zone snail shells,
49, or 76 percent were Rabdotus. There were 12
Polygyridae along with the two nonnative shells
and the single freshwater snail. Twenty-nine of
the 49 Rabdotus were between elevations of 98.40
and 98.60 in Unit 2, where a series of burrow-like
disturbances were mapped. The remainder were
scattered fairly evenly throughout the column.
Discussion
The most obvious observation is the lack of
Rabdotus species snails in Cultural Zone 1. This
zone contains only Polygyridae, which are
primarily associated with moisture retaining
features within woodland environments (Cheatum
and Fullington1971:2). Fully 73 percent (N=28)
of all Polygyridae were at elevations above 99.60,
and with some retaining coloration, it is likely
they are a mix of both an in situ death assemblage

93

and more recent burrowing described for the
species.
No Rabdotus species snails were recovered above
an elevation of 99.60. If the 29 snails that are
considered to be intrusive are discounted, then 41
percent of recovered Rabdotus was within
Cultural Zone 2. While no attempt to classify
Rabdotus by any type of size break was
attempted, it was noted that there was a fairly high
number of small-bodied specimens present
overall. This appears to be a natural population,
especially as there is little other evidence to
suggest human consumption.
Although not individually analyzed, the Rabdotus
species compare favorably overall with Rabdotus
dealbatus, and the Polygyra appear to be
dominated by Polygyra texasiana. R. dealbatus is
reportedly commonly found in Texas within open
woodlands (Fullington and Pratt 1974), while P.
texasiana is described as found both in deep
woodlands and in open prairie (Cheatum and
Fullington 1971). Of the other Polygyridae,
Mesodon roemeri (N=3, 99.30-99.70) is described
as found commonly in dense woods near water.
Praticollela (cf berlandieriana) (N=1, 99.6099.70) may be somewhat drought tolerant and can
be interpreted as found in open woods.
Stenotrema leai alicia (N=8, 99.00-99.87
[surface]) are found in both dense and open
woods. This lack of specificity in environmental
preference of these snails does not help explain
the lack of Rabdotus from the upper levels. It is
possible that human use of the site area made it
inhospitable for the larger bodied Rabdotus snails.
The single Elimia comalensis, (99.20-99.30) is
endemic to Comal Springs in Comal County, but
is found across the state. It is usually found in
clear running water with a gravel substrate. The
two Ruminella decollata (99.80-99.85) are
recently introduced species, probably arriving
through greenhouse or nursery businesses.
