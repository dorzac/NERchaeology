MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report documents the results of an intensive cultural resource survey of 1 horizontal
directional drill (HDD) bore entry/exit location along Eagle Rock Energy Partners, LP‘s (Eagle
Rock EP), proposed natural gas pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in south-central Nacogdoches
County, Texas. The HDD location would be utilized to install a segment of the proposed
pipeline under a 30-meter- (m-) (100-foot- [ft-]) wide abandoned tram road ROW owned by the
US Forest Service (USFS). Although the HDD bore entry and exit locations are situated on
private property adjacent to the USFS-owned abandoned tram road and the undertaking is
privately funded, the installation of the proposed pipeline via HDD across property owned by the
USFS would require a Special Use Permit issued by the USFS. As such, the segment of
proposed pipeline ROW to be installed via HDD falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact
significant cultural resources, Eagle Rock EP was required to provide for a cultural resources
inventory and assessment of the project‘s Area of Potential Effect (APE) and to evaluate the
project‘s possible impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE. The APE of the
proposed undertaking consists of the entry and exit points of the proposed HDD to the east and
west of the abandoned tram road, each of which cover an area measuring only approximately
0.01 hectares (ha) (0.02 acres [ac]) in size, totaling 0.02 ha (0.04 ac).
To meet its responsibilities under the NHPA, Eagle Rock EP contracted with Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed
0.04-ha (0.02-ac) APE. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological and/or
historical sites are located within the APE, and, if any exist, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). On February 5, 2010, Horizon
archeologists Michael Mudd, crew chief, and Jared Wiersema, archeological field technician,
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive
survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed project. The APE was traversed by Horizon‘s archeologists, the modern
ground surface was thoroughly inspected for historic and prehistoric cultural resources, and
4 shovel tests were excavated within the APE, including 2 shovel tests each on the east and
west sides of the abandoned tram road ROW at the HDD bore entry and exit locations, thereby

Management Summary

exceeding the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) requirements
for a project area of this size.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey. Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the project area as a result of intensive survey
activities, and no previously documented cultural resources are present in the vicinity of the
project area that would be adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the USFS and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of
the discovery.

This report documents the results of an intensive cultural resource survey of 1 horizontal
directional drill (HDD) bore entry/exit location along Eagle Rock Energy Partners, LP‘s (Eagle

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed project area is located in a remote, rural area in south-central
Nacogdoches County. The APE lies within the Coastal Plains physiographic region (Fenneman
1938:605-630). Environmentally, the Gulf Coastal Plain is characterized as:
…an area where the temperate southeastern woodlands gradually give way to the
grasslands of the plains. It is a land of mixed forests, pine barrens, open savannas, tall
grass prairies, and littoral marshes. Much of the terrain is gently rolling but mountains
(the Ouachitas) and coastal flats are to be found in the northern and southern margins of
the region, respectively. A number of perennial rivers and streams cross the area,
ending in the deltas and bays along the…Gulf of Mexico (Story and Guy 1990:2).

Northeastern Texas supports 3 major physiographic communities—the Blackland
Prairie, the Post Oak Savanna (or Oak Woodlands), and the Pineywoods (Diamond et al. 1987).
The Blackland Prairie is a narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to
the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. This area consists of low, rolling land that
extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River
Valley in Northeast Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams
flow at very gentle gradients. The Blackland Prairie supports a tall-grass community that
commonly includes such species as little bluestem, yellow Indian grass, big bluestem,
switchgrass, and various forbs (Diamond et al. 1987:209, 211). The distribution of the tall-grass
prairie is closely related to patterns of rainfall and soil character, as the prairie tends to occur in
areas that receive less than 102 centimeters (cm) (40 inches [in]) of rain annually and that have
clayey, calcareous soils (Collins and Bousman 1990:29).
The Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods support medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests, and shortleaf loblolly pines are common in the Pineywoods on upland fine sandy loam
soils with adequate moisture. Small areas of tall-grass prairie may occur in both communities
(cf. Jordan 1981). The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow, southwest-to-northeast-trending
woodland belt that marks a natural transition zone, or ecotone, between the more xeric
Blackland Prairie to the west and the more mesic Pineywoods to the east (Kuchler 1964). The

HJN 100019 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Post Oak Savanna is composed primarily of post oak, blackjack oak, hickory, pecan, and ash
(Kuchler 1964).
The Pineywoods region is composed of 2 distinct forest communities—mixed pinehardwood forest and longleaf pine forest. The mixed pine-hardwood forest is characterized by
medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous hardwoods, including a wide variety of oak, elm, hickory,
maple, sweetgum, and other mesic species. In some cases, the presence of pine represents a
subclimax vegetation association. The longleaf pine forest, within which the current project area
is situated, is most common in the southern part of Northeast Texas, extending south to the
coastal prairies of Southeast Texas. Longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines, as well as a variety
of hardwoods such as oak, hickory, beech, birch, gum, and magnolia, as well as tupelo and bald
cypress in swampy floodplain areas, are constituents of this vegetation region. Within both
Pineywoods vegetation communities, bottomland forests and wetlands are common. These
communities are dominated by hardwood and swamp forests, marsh and bog vegetation, herbs,
shrubs, and other plants that tolerate extended periods of stream overflow. Common trees in
these habitats are sweetgum, black tupelo, elm, green ash, bald cypress, water oak, overcup
oak, cottonwood, black willow, and American hornbeam (Diamond et al. 1987:212). Herbs,
shrubs, ferns, cane, wax myrtle, sassafras, holly, yaupon, cane, and buttonbush occur along the
margins of marshes, bogs, and channel lakes and sloughs.
As a result of moderately high rainfall and extensive aquifers, perennial rivers and
streams are common across most of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Story 1990:8-9). With the
exception of some small coastal streams, 6 major river basins occur in this region—the Brazos,
Neches, Red, Sabine, San Jacinto, and Trinity—all of which flow in a more or less southeasterly
direction and discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. Under current climatic conditions, all of the
larger rivers are reliable sources of surface water, though smaller streams are more variable.
The most dependable are those that receive groundwater discharge and delayed runoff
(Thurmond 1981:29-36). The least reliable are those fed solely by direct runoff. Two other
sources of surface water, lakes and springs, also occur in the area. With the exception of
Caddo Lake (a natural, albeit artificially enlarged, impoundment) on the Cypress River and lakes
on the Red and lower Brazos floodplains, most lakes in the region occur on smaller streams, are
dry at least part of the year, and have minimal subsistence value. Springs are fairly numerous
in the region, and even high-order streams often have sustained water flow because they are
fed by groundwater discharge and aquifers (Story 1990:8-9). Changing land use practices,
farming, and erosion have caused many springs to dry up over the last 150 years or to have a
much reduced flow (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:38).
Nacogdoches County is extensively dissected by creeks and rivers. The project area is
situated within the Angelina River watershed on the distal end of an upland ridge overlooking
the floodplain and terraces of Finley Branch, a tributary of Dorr Creek, which, in turn, discharges
into the Angelina River arm of Sam Rayburn Reservoir a short distance south of the project
area. The Angelina River flows generally southward to its confluence with the Neches River,
which, in turn, flows southward, discharging into the Gulf of Mexico in the vicinity of Port
Neches, Texas.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is situated within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Sedimentary bedrock formations of limestone and sandstone
laid down during the Cretaceous Period parallel the margins of the ancient, receding coastline of
the Gulf of Mexico and crop out as cuestas or escarpments across the generally southward dip
of the modern land surface (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Little internal relief of over 50 m
(164 ft) occurs except along the eroded fronts of the cuestas and in the ironstone hills (Fisher
1965; Godfrey et al. 1973).
Soils in Northeast Texas are divided into 2 broad groups—upland soils and alluvial
valley soils (Godfrey et al. 1973). Upland soils support tall grasses and hardwoods and tend to
form directly on bedrock, except where colluvial deposition has occurred during the Quaternary
Period. These soils vary from moist, acidic soils with a sandy to loamy surface horizon and
clayey subsoil to soils whose basic loamy surface horizons overlie clay-enriched B-horizons.
Bone and shell preservation is common in archeological deposits in the latter soils (Story
1990:9). Mixed hardwood and pine forests occur on the acidic upland soils in Northeast Texas.
Tall-grass prairie occurs on the dark, clayey soils of the Blackland Prairie to the west of the
project area (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993).
As a region, Northeast Texas exhibits relatively little topographic relief. The bedrock is
exclusively sedimentary and is not very resistant to erosion. Drainage is well developed,
including major river systems that arise outside of the region (i.e., Red and Trinity) as well as
within it (i.e., Angelina, Attoyac, Cypress, Neches, Sabine, and Sulphur). Much of Northeast
Texas is dominated by fluvial transport systems in which streams tend to meander within their
valleys, locally cutting into the outer banks of bends and depositing sediment packages against
the inner banks of bends (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Valley soils are important
archeologically because they often contain stratified cultural deposits, usually in association with
buried, cumulic soils. Point bars, levees, and flood basins are distinctive geomorphic features
that share the common attribute of active aggradation. In theory, archeological sites may be
expected to form in such landforms and, depending on the rates of sedimentation and human
occupation, may develop internal stratification. To date, however, most archeological surveys
conducted along streams in Northeast Texas have documented almost no sites on levees or
point bars (Hsu 1969; Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth et al. 1977). The low density of recorded
archeological sites in such areas likely results from the low site visibility and difficult survey
conditions. The low number of archeological sites recorded in these drainages is almost
certainly a function of the difficulty of surveying floodplain environments partially covered by
impenetrable swamps (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993; Perttula 2004:370).
Natural lakes, ponds, and swamps are also common features of Northeast Texas
floodplains, and they typically represent sections of abandoned channels of rivers and streams
that have not been filled by alluvial deposits (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Lakes generally
contain some open water, marshes are heavily vegetated (usually with grasses) but do not form
peat, and bogs are waterlogged and spongy areas in which mosses and other decaying
vegetation produce an acidic environment conducive to peat development. Lakes, ponds, and

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

marshes in Northeast Texas are generally of fresh water and form aerobic, basic
environments—they may contain excellent stratigraphic records and preserved bone, though
they are not conducive to botanical preservation. Bogs, on the other hand, are anaerobic,
acidic, and may have remained permanently saturated over long periods of time. Such
environments are optimal for the preservation of normally perishable artifacts (Chelf 1946) as
well as the entire spectrum of natural organic remains (Bryant 1989). Bog material is suitable
for direct radiocarbon dating, and the 2 pollen cores upon which much of the palynological
record of Northeast Texas is based were obtained from the Boriack and Weakly bogs in Lee
and Leon counties, respectively (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al.
1987).
Valley margins in Northeast Texas streams include colluvial slopes and occasional
alluvial fans. Such geomorphic features represent areas of natural deposition that may be well
suited to some kinds of human activity, a combination favoring the formation of stratified
archeological sites (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The lower reaches of such features afford
high ground adjacent to flood basin resources, and archeologists commonly find sites in these
settings in Northeast Texas.
Aeolian landscape features pose a somewhat more complicated scenario in Northeast
Texas (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). These are extensive surficial sand deposits that are
subject to modification by wind at any time that vegetative cover is disrupted. Some indications
of aeolian modification of sand deposits have been noted in and near the region (e.g., Gunn and
Brown 1982; Mandel 1987; Perttula et al. 1986), but the validity of some of these interpretations,
the possible extent of Quaternary aeolian-modified landscapes, and the timing of any increased
aeolian activity are in question.
Geologically, the Eagle Rock EP project area is situated on the distal end of an upland
ridge overlooking the broad terraces and floodplain of Finley Branch, a tributary of Dorr Creek.
This upland landform is part of the Sparta Sand Formation, a deep deposit of very-fine- to finegrained quartz sand with lignitic clay and silt partings that formed during the middle Eocene
(Flawn 1968). While the landform on which the project area is situated formed prior to the
Holocene epoch, Holocene-age sediments are ubiquitous on the terraces and floodplain
environments surrounding the confluence of Finley Branch and Door Creek in the lowlands to
the east of and below the project area. Geomorphologically, the project area is underlain by
Darco loamy fine sand, 8 to 20% slopes (20), which consists of loamy residuum weathered from
sandstone and shale (NRCS 2010). A typical profile consists of loamy fine sand from 0 to
122 centimeters (cm) (0 to 48 inches [in]) below surface underlain by sandy clay loam to a depth
of 213 cm (84 in) (NRCS 2010).
Aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep sandy sediments in
Northeast Texas, especially adjacent to major streams. The proximity of the current project
area to the confluence of 2 major streams and to the Angelina River proper, combined with the
deep sandy and clayey loam sediments mapped within the project area, suggest that the APE
has at least moderate potential for intact, buried archeological deposits to occur within any intact
alluvial sediments. Historic-age cultural resources may occur in any physiographic setting.

2.3

CLIMATE

The environment in Northeast Texas has not remained the same throughout the ca.
12,000 years during which humans have lived in the region. Archeological, faunal, geological,
and pollen evidence suggests that significant changes have occurred, and these changes have
major implications for the development and maintenance of human adaptive strategies in the
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). At present, these changes are poorly understood as only
limited evidence of past environments prior to ca. 3,000 years ago has been obtained (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Collins and Bousman 1990; Story 1990).
Evidence for climatic change from the late Pleistocene to the present is most often
obtained through studies of pollen sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Few pollen studies
have been conducted in Northeast Texas—to date, only a few studies from Buck Creek Marsh
and Jewett Mine have provided interpretable pollen data from this portion of the state (Jacobs
1991; Scott-Cummings 1991), but these are poorly dated or have serious gaps in their records.
Nevertheless, an important series of pollen sites occur in areas surrounding Northeast Texas
(cf. Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The best dated and most informative pollen sequences come
from Boriack Bog in Lee County and Weakly Bog in Leon County (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway
and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). The radiocarbon dates from Boriack Bog suggest a
regular accumulation of deposits and indicate that Boriack Bog surface sediments are
approximately 3,000 years old. Bryant (1977) indicates that the bog was drained and the
surface peat was excavated in the 20th century; thus, the surface of the peat was lowered to
sediments of that age. Weakly Bog, by contrast, covers the last 3,000 years or so, and the
bottom samples roughly match the younger portion of Boriack Bog. Thus, Boriack and Weakly
bogs cumulatively provide a general picture of vegetation change throughout most of the late
Pleistocene and Holocene periods for this region of Texas.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for East Texas that
includes 3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.),
the Late Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. The limited available evidence suggests
that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods and
that, prior to ca. 10,000 years B.P., it was forested with species that prefer cool, temperate
conditions, including boreal taxa such as spruce (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This late
Pleistocene/early Holocene climate is inferred to have been cooler than today, with increased
precipitation and/or more effective moisture, but with perhaps less seasonal climatic constraints.
The Late Glacial Period was characterized by a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 2004)
during which the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak
savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial Period, the environment appears to have been more stable.
During the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.P.), warmer temperatures prevailed, with less
moisture and presumably a lower density of forest cover. The deciduous forests were replaced
by prairies and post oak savannas. Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that significant

HJN 100019 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

expanses of grassland were present along the western edge of the Northeast Texas region.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. In the middle Holocene, the period between
ca. 7000 and 4000 B.P., much drier and warmer conditions may have characterized the region‘s
climate, possibly resulting in even more widespread grasslands and replacement of forests
along its western edge. The forest cover in Northeast Texas is suspected to have been at its
lowest density during this time period (Collins and Bousman 1990:62).
Following the warm and dry interlude of the middle Holocene, environmental data
suggest that a gradual reforestation of the region continued into the late Holocene (ca.
4000 B.P. to present). Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that prairie areas were replaced
first by oak savanna, then by oak-hickory forest in the western part of the region and by oakhickory-pine forest in the eastern portions of the region. Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest
that essentially modern environmental conditions in Northeast Texas were probably achieved by
about 1,500 years ago.
Stable carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope analyses are becoming
increasingly important sources of information about past climatic conditions and changes. A
14,000-year stable isotopic record from the Aubrey Site in the Trinity River Basin in NorthCentral Texas documents changing climatic conditions with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler)
or more humid climates from ca. 11,000 to 7500 B.P., again between 4000 and 2000 B.P., and
yet again after 1,000 years ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Perttula 2004:371). Conversely,
the Aubrey Site record suggests periods of warmer-than-present climate between 7,500 and
4,000 years ago and between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Interestingly, fossil vertebrate,
pollen, and stable isotope data from Central Texas and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat
different story, highlighting 2 dry climatic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/2500 B.P. and after
1,000 years ago (Toomey et al. 1993; Perttula 2004:371). The timing and nature of such
climatic changes have major implications regarding the relative position of the prairie-forest
border, the possible presence or absence of bison, and the natural resource potential of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna.
The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm,
humid weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The
climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm.
Winters are short and mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing
weather interspersed with cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or
cold temperatures are rare. Sudden temperature changes are not very common during
summer, but may occur frequently in winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by
cold waves or sudden, strong north winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average
winter temperatures range between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and average summer
temperatures range from 85 to 95°F. Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on

early winter mornings, but freezing temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free
season is 246 days (March 15 to November 16) (Bomar 1983).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and
May, and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about
45 inches. Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and spring, and light snows fall
occasionally in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but do occur in the vicinity of
the project area. Precipitation generally increases from north to south across the region and
decreases from east to west in a clinal pattern. The wettest counties in the area (Shelby,
Sabine, and San Augustine) receive more than 48 inches of annual precipitation, while the
driest counties (Fannin, Henderson, and Anderson) receive between 36 and 40 inches of
precipitation each year. Droughts are not uncommon, and periods of lower summer
precipitation are often accompanied by extended droughts caused by warm continental Pacific
air masses moving across the area from the west.
Dendrochronological analyses of tree rings suggest that numerous wet and dry spells
occurred during the last 1,000 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and
the worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again
in the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). Stahle et al. (1985) suggest that the worst
June drought to occur in the past 450 years occurred during the period between A.D. 1549 and
1577. More favorable conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially
between ca. A.D. 1390 and 1440, then in the late part of the 16th and early 17th centuries
(Perttula 2004:371). Such climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and
success of maize harvests during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods and neighboring
Post Oak Savanna (Perttula 2004:371). Similar fluctuations throughout the Holocene would
also have affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and
animals upon which non-agricultural human populations relied.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Northeast Texas Archeological Region is situated within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas. Its western boundary, which is approximated by a line running north from
western Harris County to western Red River County (Dice 1943), is the western boundary of the
main body of pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. In Texas,
Austroriparian vegetation consists of 2 vegetation regions, the long-leaf pine and pine-oak forest
regions. The project area is situated in a forested upland environment within the mixed pinehardwood forest section of the Pineywoods vegetation region.
Before the advent of the lumber industry in the 1880s, the area was covered by forests
of immense trees. Though these forests have since been destroyed by more than a century of
intensive logging, many areas are now reforested, and much of Jasper County is dotted with
reforested pine and hardwood forests. Forested uplands within the project area generally
consist of a mix of hardwood and pine stands with dense understories composed of trees,
shrubs, and vines. These areas are typically dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleaf

pine (Pinus echinata), water oak (Quercus nigra), post oak (Quercus stellata), southern red oak
(Quercus falcata), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), winged elm (Ulmus alata), eastern red
cedar (Juniperus virginiana), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), and blackberry (Rhubus sp.). Upland shrubland consists of small tree
species such as various elms, various oaks, sweet gum, and pine, as well as a variety of shrub
species such as eastern false-willow, sumac (Rhus sp.), Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), and
rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum). Upland grasslands are dominated by bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactylon), nettles (Solanum spp.), and yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolium).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, a
subdivision of the THC‘s Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The cultural
history of Northeast Texas can be subdivided into 9 broad temporal periods, although the
historic period has been differentiated into overlapping Historic Caddoan and Historic
EuroAmerican periods to distinguish between the highly divergent historical experiences of the
indigenous Native Americans and EuroAmerican settlers during the settlement of Texas
(Table 1).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9500 TO 7000 B.C.)

The initial human occupation of the New World can be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft
Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern North America as
early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent discoveries at
Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human occupation in South America by
at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al. 1997). Most archeologists
presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation in North America during the
Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Northeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This period
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of small animals,
fish, and shellfish during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in Northeast Texas for
hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America; rather, a
broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced until the Late Prehistoric
period.
The distribution of PaleoIndian artifacts within the region suggests that these early
aboriginal occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Anderson 1996; Perttula 2004:373; Thurmond 1990) as well as in resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment to the north (Anderson 1996). Anderson (1996) hypothesizes
that the initial and most intensive PaleoIndian settlement of the Southeast (including Northeast
Texas) occurred in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.
From there, PaleoIndian groups spread throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 250-to-400-km (155-to-249-mi) intervals. The relatively sparse PaleoIndian
archeological record, combined with the dispersion of artifacts across many different landforms
and physiographic settings, seems to indicate that PaleoIndian groups were highly mobile,
generalized hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields
and Tomka 1993), as has been inferred for PaleoIndian populations on the Great Plains.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 7000 TO 200 B.C.)

Throughout most of North America, the onset of the hypothesized Hypsithermal drying
trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.P.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). In many regions, this climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle—the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Northeast Texas, however, a generalized hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory prior to the advent of large-scale
agricultural systems during the Late Prehistoric.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture have been noted as well. Johnson
(1962) employs archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
to bring chronological order to the diverse Archaic archeological record in Northeast Texas.
Johnson‘s (1962) temporal divisions are based on projectile point sequences and on the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic period. More recent refinements of the
projectile point sequence (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990) document straight and expanding-stem

forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic subperiods and contracting-stem darts
during the Late Archaic and subsequent Early Ceramic periods (Schambach 1982, 1998).

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (CA. 200 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), also known as the Woodland
period, is characterized in much of Northeast Texas, especially from the Sabine to the Red
rivers, primarily by plain, relatively thick ceramic bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted
axe heads, smaller and thinner versions of Gary dart points, and later in the period by cornernotched arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Early Ceramic sites along the Red River in
southwestern Arkansas and in Northeast Texas have abundant ceramics, though many sites of
this age, especially between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, do not evince such prevalent use of
ceramics (Perttula 2004:376). This situation suggests regional differences in food processing
technologies and/or dietary habits, and may further highlight differences in the degree of
sedentism among populations across the area (Skibo and Blinman 1999). Lower Mississippi
Valley ceramic styles (e.g., Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised,
Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some regularity at sites in the Sabine,
Sulphur, and Big Cypress basins (Story 1990). These ceramics may provide evidence of
contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South and Lower Mississippi Valley
populations, or they may represent the adoption of Lower Mississippi Valley stylistic and
decorative attributes by local potters (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
The Early Ceramic inhabitants of Northeast Texas were still primarily hunter-gatherers,
though they may have lived in increasingly large groups and/or resided for longer periods of
time at certain sites (Perttula 2004:377). Larger villages and multiple mound centers begin to
be constructed during this period on the major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers). Some
sites have relatively substantial midden deposits, particularly along the Red River and in the
upper Sulphur River basin (Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982), and some evidence for
structures (probably daubed pole and thatch structures), but the degree of settlement
permanence is still less than that seen in the subsequent, long-term, Caddoan settlements of
Northeast Texas (Perttula et al. 1993:99).
On the basis of available paleobotanical information, Early Ceramic groups may have
cultivated squash (McGregor 1996) and used native seeds, tubers, and roots in addition to a
variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources (Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Early Ceramic occupations suggests that some level of
horticultural activity was occurring, though intensive use of colonizing weedy annuals may
similarly account for the presence of these implements. Bruseth (1998) has suggested that
maize was being cultivated during the latter portions of this period, but stable isotope analyses
of some 25 or more Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Formative to Early Caddoan human
remains indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet at this time (Rose et al. 1998).
Early Ceramic period burial mounds have been documented in bluff top and alluvial valley
settings on the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach
1982, 1997; Webb 1984) and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Northeast Texas
(Story 1990). Mortuary ceremonialism included the interment of costly, non-local raw materials

HJN 100019 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and artifacts, including chert, copper, and Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic vessels, in the burial
mounds. Evidence of mortuary or ritual practices also occurs in non-mound contexts such as
the Hurricane Hill Site, which contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill, and the Mahaffey
Site on the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, which had a large cemetery with flexed
and semiflexed burials without grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978). In the broadest sense,
the establishment of bounded cemeteries is often interpreted as a correlate of increasing
sedentism in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004:378).

3.4

FORMATIVE, EARLY, AND MIDDLE CADDOAN PERIODS (CA. A.D. 800 TO 1400)

The Caddoan archeological record represents the fluorescence of aboriginal complex
societies in northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and
southeastern Oklahoma, and generations of archeologists have long been captivated by the
beautifully manufactured ceramics and other material goods, the earthen mounds, the wellpreserved villages and hamlets, and the existence of a paleobotanical record (e.g., Perttula
2004; Swanton 1942). In the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, the timeframe referred to
in many surrounding regions as the Late Prehistoric period is usually subdivided into the
Formative Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1200), the
Middle Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400), and the Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) periods
(Perttula 1993a). European contact with Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas began around ca.
A.D. 1540, but it was sporadic until after ca. A.D. 1680 (Perttula 1992), and the Historic
Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1680 to 1860) therefore covers the period of regular interaction with
Spanish, French, and other EuroAmerican settlers up to the expulsion of the Caddo peoples
from their homelands and forced removal to Indian Territory in 1859. General characteristics of
Caddoan tradition are discussed below.
In general terms, the Caddo were characterized by:
…a large population represented by many small settlements scattered within particular
resource areas; a reliance upon horticulture as one of the primary means of subsistence;
differentiated and undifferentiated mound/habitation sites with structurally differentiated
mound classes (producing an apparently hierarchic division of places on the landscape);
differential treatment of the dead reflective of a system of ranking; [and] indications of
long-term cooperation in disposal of the dead by groups represented by some of the
archeological units (Prewitt 1974:76).

Broadly, these basic characteristics of settlement, subsistence, sociopolitical organization, and
mortuary practices are representative of the Caddoan archeological area from ca. A.D. 750 to
1750 and are similar, if not identical, to what constitutes the Mississippian period cultural
traditions of the Mississippi River Valley and Eastern Woodlands of North America (Griffin 1967,
1985; Smith 1990). Despite these similarities, Caddoan archeologists maintain that the
prehistoric and early historic Caddoan tradition developed largely independently of
Mississippian-period chiefdoms elsewhere (Smith 1990).
Formative to Middle Caddoan period groups seem to have been horticulturalists,
cultivating maize and squash along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth
1983). They also gathered nuts, tubers, and roots and were proficient hunters of deer, fish,

16

100019_arch_survey_report.docx

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a Proposed HDD Location
Under an Abandoned Tram Road in Nacogdoches County, Texas

rabbits, raccoon, turkey, squirrel, and turtles. Available paleobotanical and bioarcheological
evidence from Northeast Texas and elsewhere within the Caddoan area, including stable
carbon isotope analyses of human remains (Rose et al. 1998), suggests that Caddoan groups
became dependent primarily upon maize and other domesticated crops only after about
A.D. 1300. By ca. A.D. 1450, maize comprised more than 50% of the diet (Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998), though local variation in dependence upon cultivated plants
has been noted (Cliff 1997; Largent et al. 1997; Perttula 1999).
The most distinctive material culture item of the Caddo populations living in Northeast
Texas was the ceramics they made for cooking, storage, and serving needs (Perttula et al.
1995). The variety of styles and forms of ceramics recovered from the region hint at the range,
temporal span, and geographic extent of prehistoric Caddoan groups across the landscape
(Thurmond 1990). Story (1990:246-247, 277-319) suggests that the earliest ceramics in the
region date between ca. 500 and 100 B.C. and are closely related to the ceramics being
produced in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Between the introduction of ceramics in the region
and the emergence of distinctive Caddoan vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D. 800,
the local plainware traditions seem to have continued relatively unchanged.
Aside from ceramics, Formative to Middle Caddoan period populations in the
Pineywoods possessed a sophisticated technology based on the use of stone, bone, wood,
shell, and other media for the manufacture of tools, clothing, basketry, ornaments, and other
items (Perttula 1992:15). Well-made corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points
were common, along with siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools, such as unifacial flake scraping and cutting
implements (Perttula 2004:386). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes, as well as ceramic earspools and figurines, were also manufactured by the
Caddo at this time (Newell and Krieger 1949).
Locally available lithic materials were usually employed for the manufacture of stone
tools, but non-local raw materials and finished goods made from these raw materials were also
obtained through trade (Brown 1983; Perttula 1990). The development and maintenance of
long-distance east-to-west and north-to-south trade networks were notable features of
prehistoric Caddoan tradition. Trade items included bison hides and salt; raw materials such as
copper, stone, and marine shell; and finished objects such as pottery vessels and large
ceremonial bifaces (Brown 1983; Creel 1991; Early 1990; Vehik 1988, 1990). Many of the more
exotic trade items, especially marine shell and copper artifacts, were obtained from areas more
than 186 km (300 mi) away from the Caddoan area (Perttula 1992).

3.5

LATE CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1400 TO 1680)

As currently defined, the Late Caddoan period extends from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680
(Story 1990). Late Caddoan occupation in Northeast Texas was arguably centered on the
Great Bend area of the Red River, where Late Caddoan archeological sites are included in the
contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases (Schambach 1983). Texarkana phase sites
occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line, as well on
the lower Sulphur River (Jelks 1961), while Belcher phase sites are distributed from about

HJN 100019 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Fulton, Arkansas, to below Shreveport, Louisiana (Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; Webb 1959).
The McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex upstream from
the Texarkana phase (Bruseth 1998). Texarkana and Belcher phase sites include large,
permanent settlements with mounds, cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads (Perttula 2004:393).
The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds used as temples, burial
mounds, and/or ceremonial fire mounds, as during earlier Caddoan periods (Kelley 1998; Webb
1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural communities with
complex societies led by individuals with high status (Story 1990).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been
termed rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula 1991) because they were distributed along
secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted of functionally equivalent farmsteads
and hamlets. Small mound centers were being constructed by Titus phase and other Late
Caddoan groups up until ca. A.D. 1500, and possibly later, in Northeast Texas, but they lack
evidence of burial mounds or large platforms; rather, these mounds contain buried, burned
structures (Perttula 2004:398). The larger Caddoan towns were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These communities were
hierarchically arranged, with civic-ceremonial centers at the ―top‖ surrounded by associated
towns of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures (such as bark- or
brush-covered shelters and storage platforms) (Schambach 1983:7-8), followed by hamlets,
farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales, such as salt-making sites
(Early 1993; Gregory 1980:356-357).
Faunal subsistence remains are known from a few sites in Northeast Texas dating to this
time period but have so far received relatively little attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond 1990).
Vertebrate species represented in trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, squirrel, beaver, turtle, and fish, though deer and turkey appear to have been the
dominant economic species (Perttula et al. 1982; 1993). In general, subsistence evidence
suggests that Pineywoods Caddo practiced a strongly maize-based economy at this time (Fritz
1990:421, 425). Floral evidence from trash midden deposits suggests that maize (Zea mays)
provided a dietary staple, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source
(Perttula 2004:4005). Nuts and seeds were gathered but appear to have been of lesser
importance than during earlier time periods (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et
al. 1982).
By early historic times, the Caddoan nation comprised at least 25 separate groups,
bands, or tribes organized into loosely affiliated kin-based groups referred to by European
observers as the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches confederacies (Perttula 1992). The
Hasinai groups lived in the Angelina and Neches river valleys in East Texas, the Kadohadacho
groups on the Red River in the Great Bend area, and the Natchitoches groups on the Red River
in the vicinity of the French trading post of Natchitoches established in A.D. 1714.

3.6

HISTORIC CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1519 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico (Weddle 1985). While no

18

100019_arch_survey_report.docx

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a Proposed HDD Location
Under an Abandoned Tram Road in Nacogdoches County, Texas

documentary evidence exists for direct contact with Caddoan peoples during these initial forays,
Europeans were already conducting slave raiding and native resettlement projects along the
Texas coast by 1550 (Bolton 1912). From 1528 to 1534, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and
other survivors of the Narváez Florida expedition crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked
along the Texas coast near Galveston Bay (Bandelier 1964). Swanton (1942:29) does not
believe that Cabeza de Vaca actually encountered any Caddoan people during his wanderings,
though his dealings in Native American trade goods between coastal and inland groups suggest
that he might have traveled in the region (Perttula 1992:19). While direct contact between
Cabeza de Vaca and Caddoan peoples cannot be established by historical documentation,
Perttula (1992) argues that diseases such as typhoid and measles carried by the Narváez party
could have been transmitted to Native American groups living elsewhere along the Texas Coast
and then inland to Caddoan groups through aboriginal trade and other contact. Thus, the
Narváez and Cabeza de Vaca exploration may have been an important benchmark for the
initiation of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the Spanish Borderlands West
(Hester 1989:199; Perttula 1992:19, 1993b), and may have introduced epidemic diseases that
resulted in substantial population declines prior to the inception of more regular contact later in
the 16th century.
In the early 1540s, the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luis de Moscoso following the
death of de Soto along the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis, passed into the
Caddoan area, spending several months among the Caddoan groups who lived between the
Ouachita and Trinity rivers (Swanton 1939; Perttula 1992:19). The death of de Soto on the
Mississippi River at the province of Guachoya in the spring of 1542:
…freed the survivors from continuing upon the original objectives of the expedition.
There was only one thought shared by all: to escape from the whole dreadful adventure.
Under the leadership of Luis de Moscoso, they officially decided it was hopeless to seek
the sea…in fact, the cavaliers were clearly reluctant to take to boats…and instead
determined to march west in the direction of New Spain (Brain 1985:xlv).

Within what is now recognized as the Caddoan archeological area, Moscoso described
the provinces of Naguatex, Nondacao, and Guasco, for example, as groups that had dense
populations in scattered settlements and abundant reserves of maize (Swanton 1939:258-280).
Perttula‘s (1992) examination of Moscoso‘s travels suggests that his route passed through
settlements of aboriginal Caddoan groups known archeologically as the Late Mid-Ouachita (or
Social Hill), Belcher, Texarkana, Titus, and Frankston phases. Different versions of Moscoso‘s
route have been proposed by various researchers (e.g., Hudson 1986; Perttula 1992; Swanton
1939). The basic import of the de Soto-Moscoso expedition in 1542 is that these explorers
documented and described aspects of Caddoan settlement, subsistence strategies, aboriginal
routes of travel and trade, and social organization that are broadly consistent with inferences
that have been made based on the archeological record.
Between 1520 and 1685, various Europeans actually lived in the Caddoan area less
than 1.5 years in total, and it is virtually certain that most Caddoan peoples during this time
never saw a European (Perttula 1992:29). As a result, artifactual evidence of this phase of
European contact is minimal. As Krieger points out:

HJN 100019 AR

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

In any one site, something like twenty beads and two bits of iron may be all that can be
found to represent perhaps a century of contact; and this being true, there must be
scores of sites actually occupied during the same ‗historic period‘ from which the
archaeologist cannot recover a single European object (in Davis 1961:120).

The second major phase of European contact in the Caddoan historic period began with
the renewed exploration of the Mississippi Valley following the establishment of the Illinois
colony by the French in the 1670s. The Mississippi River, initially explored by Marquette and
Joliet in 1673 to the mouth of the Arkansas River (Delangez 1946), was fully explored to its
mouth by La Salle. Three years later, another expedition directed by La Salle intended to
colonize the area and link the Gulf Coast with the growing French colonies of Illinois and
Canada. For unknown reasons, this expedition missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and
came ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast at Matagorda Bay (Cox 1922; Gilmore 1986). La Salle
made several trips from Fort St. Louis to explore the region and try to find the Mississippi River,
visiting the Hasinai (or Cenis, in the French transcription) in 1686 before turning back with
several horses purchased from the Hasinai. Another effort was made in 1687 by the survivors
of Fort St. Louis; however, La Salle was murdered by several of the men partway through this
trip, and the remaining party decided to stay on with the Hasinai.
The years between 1685 and 1714 were a time of continual French and Spanish
exploration of the Caddoan area. The threat of French settlement in an area the Spanish
considered to be officially under their hegemony spurred serious Spanish efforts to settle and
missionize the country east of New Mexico and the Rio Grande known to them as the ―Kingdom
of the Tejas‖ (Bolton 1912; Perttula 1992:30). At the same time, the French were determined to
take advantage of the La Salle explorations to extend their claims in the region. Shortly
thereafter, English colonies were established along the South Atlantic Coast that wished to
extend trade routes west to Native American groups living on the Mississippi River and the
Texas Gulf Coast (Coker and Watson 1986; Crane 1929; Usner 1989). European political
relationship, trade and religious objectives, and the larger spheres of influence under the control
of the Spanish, French, and British in the developing world economy all played important parts
in the fate of the Caddo between ca. 1685 and 1800 (Braudel 1984:21-85, 387-429; Wallerstein
1974; Wolf 1982:129-231). Trade contacts, rumors of settlement, and exploration by one
government were responded to in kind by others as part of the unstable process of colonization.
The nature and character of sustained European contact has been comprehensively discussed
by many researchers (Bolton 1915, 1987; Cox 1909; Fieldhouse 1966; Galloway 1982; Gibson
1989; Giraud 1957, 1963, 1974a, 1974b; John 1975, 1985; Surrey 1916; Swagerty 1984; Usner
1987; Wade 1989), and only the broad outlines are presented below in the interest of
summarizing the varying European objectives as they impacted the Caddo.
From the 1790s, containment of the expanding US east of the Mississippi River
dominated Spain‘s concerns in its Texas and Louisiana colonies, and the allegiance of the
various Indian nations of the Provincias Internas, such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Comanche,
was perceived by the Spanish government as a critical factor in controlling the frontier. The
1790s were a period of growth in the American fur trade, and another major growth period in the
industry occurred from 1800 to 1808 (Clayton 1967). Beaver was the primary fur resource in
the trade from 1790 to 1820. The Kadohadacho and Hasinai participated in the trade from the

outset, and their contributions to the fur trade were considered important parts of the Spanish
and Louisiana economies (Ewers 1969:47-48; Flores 1984; Peake 1954:17-18). Following the
purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the US moved rapidly to explore the boundaries
and character of its new territory, and the federal government emphasized the establishment of
commercial and political relationships with resident aboriginal groups, including Caddoan tribes.
The Freeman and Custis expedition of 1806 on the Red River followed specific guidelines
regarding interaction with the Indians. This expedition was ultimately abandoned due to
interference with the Spanish related to questions about the boundary between Spanish Texas
and the Louisiana Territory. The US initiated a border war with Spain that resulted in the 1806
Neutral Ground Agreement. Possession of the Red River, as well as the territorial allegiance of
the Kadohadacho, remained unresolved (Flores 1984:287).
As Spanish and American trading ventures evolved through the first 2 decades of the
19th century, the actual settlement of the Red River, its tributaries, and the neutral ground
between Louisiana and Texas began in earnest (Strickland 1937; Haggard 1945). By 1818,
nearly 3,000 settlers from the Midwest and upper South had squatted illegally in Caddo country
along the south side of the Red River from the Great Bend to the Kiamichi River (Lottinville
1980:170-172). Anglo-American settlements increased up to and beyond the time of the Texas
Revolution in 1836 (Strickland 1937:64-238). This settlement expansion was also accompanied
by an influx of aboriginal groups from east of the Mississippi River and from the Arkansas River,
including Choctaw, Cherokee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Shawnee, and Koasati groups
(Anderson 1990; Everett 1990; Ewers 1969; Kniffen et al. 1987; Williams 1964). These groups
exchanged hides, corn, pumpkins, and beans at the trading house in Nacogdoches (Swanton
1942:88) as well as with American government traders at the new agency house at the mouth of
the Sulphur River. As the frontier moved west, Caddoan Indians in Louisiana became more
isolated in the Anglo-American community and were under continual pressure from these
settlers and from the immigrant Indians (Swanton 1942:88; Williams 1964). In Texas,
settlement pressures did not impinge on Caddoan lands until after 1830 (Strickland 1937:318355), though Stephen F. Austin viewed the aboriginal populations of Texas as a hindrance to
the security of settlement (Barker 1925).
Following the death of the Caddo chief Dehahuit in 1833, American pressure in
Louisiana on the new Caddo chiefs led to the ceding of Caddo homelands within the limits of the
US on 1 July 1835 (Swanton 1942:89-92). The Caddo relinquished their lands for $80,000,
agreed to move at their own expense within 1 year of the treaty date, and moved to Texas just
prior to the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The term Caddo Nation came to be
associated with the Cherokee as well as with the Hasinai, Anadarko, and other related tribes of
East Texas, and the Indians became subject to the repressive measures of successive Republic
of Texas administrations (Neighbours 1973, 1975). By the early 1840s, the Caddo Nation was
composed of remnants of the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and other once-independent Caddoan
tribes, and it had been essentially pushed out of East Texas along with the other groups who
had signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Republic of Texas in 1843 (Strickland
1937:355; Swanton 1942:97). In 1846, the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Anadarko lived together
in a village of about 150 houses on the Brazos River near the present City of Waco, Texas;
shortly thereafter, they moved near the Clear Fork of the Brazos to maintain their distance from

Anglo-American frontier communities. From 1846 to 1854, the US government and the Texas
legislature founded the Texas Indian Reservation on the Brazos River (Neighbours 1957, 1973),
but this reservation lasted only until 1859 due to frictions among white settlers, Indian agents,
and the agglomeration of tribal members. Accordingly, in August 1859, the Caddo Nation, then
about 1,050 people in number, was removed to the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency in
western Oklahoma. Since that time, the history of the Caddo peoples is largely similar to the
overall history of the US.

3.7

HISTORIC EUROAMERICAN PERIOD (CA. 1519 TO PRESENT)

When the first Europeans explored the region now encompassed by Jasper County, it
was inhabited by various Caddoan and Atakapan Native American groups, but diseases,
especially smallpox, ravaged these agrarian peoples by the time the first Anglo-American
settlers arrived.1 The area was also home and hunting ground to the Ais Indians, who lived
between the Sabine and Neches rivers. An early settler, William McFarland, noted in his diary
in 1844 that the Ais Indians were an older group incorporated in the Caddo confederacy.
Another tribe, the Biloxi Indians, established 3 villages east of the Neches River in Jasper
County before 1846. They were never large in number and were considered peaceful.
The first settler of European descent in the area was probably Spanish, but French and
English also traveled through the region. Early records and maps indicate that the Moscoso
Expedition may have crossed Jasper County on the return trip to the Mississippi River in 1542.
In 1754, several French trappers under the leadership of Joseph Blancpain were arrested by
Spanish authorities interested in fending off the French occupation of East Texas. English
explorers entered Sabine Lake and traveled up the Neches River by boat in 1774.
One of the earliest settlers was John R. Bevil, who moved to Texas prior to 1829 and
received a first-class land grant on the Angelina River near the site of present-day Jasper.
Bevil‘s settlement became known as Bevilport and was an important river-navigation point from
1830 until 1860. In 1829, Lorenzo de Zavala obtained a Mexican empresario grant covering
most of what is now Jasper County. During the Texas Revolution, volunteers from Bevilport
joined other Texans in confrontations with Mexican troops at Anahuac, Bexar, and
Nacogdoches.
Jasper County was established when the Convention of 1836 converted old
municipalities into counties, but it was not until 1837 that an act was passed defining the county
boundaries. The town of Jasper was named county seat by the county commissioners in 1836
and grew around a log courthouse and jail built on the main square. In 1846, the original Jasper
County was split into 2 parts—the eastern portion became Newton County and the western
portion became the current Jasper County. In 1847, Andrew Smyth built a sawmill near

Bevilport using the swift current of Indian Creek for power. After a fire destroyed the Jasper
County Courthouse and all county records in 1849, a new 2-story structure was constructed.
River transportation facilitated trade and helped to encourage growth in the area, though
riverboats came to Bevilport only when the water of the Angelina River was high enough to
permit navigation. By 1850, there were 123 farms in Jasper County. County farmers harvested
more than 16,500 bushels of corn that year, along with 3,750 pounds of tobacco, 3,565 bushels
of rice, and other crops such as sweet potatoes and wheat. According to the US census,
1,767 people were living in the county that year; 30% of them were slaves. The county‘s lumber
industry started in 1852 when a steam sawmill was built at Ford‘s Bluff (later named Evadale).
By 1860, just before the Civil War, the county had grown to include 250 farms
encompassing more than 275,000 ac, including 19,000 ac classified as ―improved.‖ Most of the
county‘s farms and plantations were smaller than 100 ac. Only 3 holdings were larger than
500 ac, and none was larger than 1,000 ac.
The census reported 2,426 whites and
1,611 slaves (39% of the total population) in the county that year. There were no free blacks.
According to the census, there were 170 slaveholders in the county, but only 3 of them owned
more than 50 slaves, and most owned fewer than 5 slaves. The county harvest that year
amounted to 112,400 bushels of corn, 14,500 pounds of tobacco, and 3,792 bales of cotton.
Almost 5,400 cattle and 1,549 sheep were also reported in the county.
The county's economy and population grew slowly between 1860 and 1880, then
contracted slightly between 1880 and 1890. In 1870, the census counted 4,218 people living in
the area, including 1,759 blacks.
By that year, the county had 411 farms, but only
21,600 improved acres; all but 2 holdings were smaller than 500 ac. Cotton remained an
important crop during this period, though acreage declined during the 1880s from 4,500 ac in
1880 to 3,800 in 1890. Meanwhile, cattle were increasingly important for the local economy;
almost 6,800 cattle were reported in Jasper in 1880 and almost 9,400 in 1890. The number of
farms in the county increased to 606 by 1880 but decreased slightly during the 1880s to stand
at 603 in 1890. The population mirrored the county‘s fluctuating economy during these years. In
1880, 5,779 people lived in Jasper County, but, in 1890, only 5,592.
Between 1890 and 1910, the county grew steadily despite the decline of cotton farming.
There were 849 farms in Jasper County by 1900 and 864 by 1910. Though the number of acres
cultivated in the county remained around 20,000 throughout this period, the farm economy
diversified. In 1900, county farmers produced 27,000 chickens, for example, and 10,000 sheep
were reported in 1910. The number of cattle in the county increased to more than 14,000 by
1910. Meanwhile, cotton was planted on only 1,571 ac. During the 1880s and into the
20th century, the timber industry steadily grew into an integral part of the local economy. In
1882, the Texas Tram and Lumber Company moved its logging camp to Magnolia Springs and
floated logs down Wright Creek into the Neches River. In 1894, Kirbyville began to grow when
the company moved a logging camp there. At about the same time, railroads were built into the
county, linking it directly with outside markets. In 1895, the Gulf, Beaumont and Kansas City
Railway completed its track from Kirbyville to Roganville in Newton County. Shortly after 1900,
the line reached Jasper, greatly increasing shipping capability for the growing timber industry,
which was previously dependent on river transportation. The county‘s agricultural economy

HJN 100019 AR

23

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

grew steadily but slowly during this period, while the rise of the timber industry helped to
increase the population of the county to 7,138 by 1900 and 14,000 by 1910.
The economy continued to fluctuate between 1910 and 1929, partly because of a brief
revival of cotton production in the area. About 2,250 ac were planted in cotton in Jasper County
in 1920 and more than 9,203 ac in 1929, when 878 farms were reported. Meanwhile, the
number of manufacturing workers, most of whom worked in the lumber mills, rose from 1,229 in
1919 to 1,748 by 1929. The population of the county increased to 15,569 by 1920 and to
17,408 by 1930.
The effects of the Great Depression in Jasper County are illustrated in the 1940 census.
Unemployment was high, with 1,054 jobless workers out of a total workforce of 5,875. The
number of industrial establishments, primarily related to the timber industry, declined from 22 in
1929 to 15 in 1940. Federal projects helped to stabilize the economy somewhat. During the
late 1930s, for example, the Jasper-Newton Electrical Cooperative was formed, with
headquarters in Kirbyville, to bring electricity to rural areas, and Jasper became the
headquarters for the Lower Neches Valley Authority. The number of farms in the county
increased from 878 in 1930 to 1,201 in 1940.
The county ceased to be a cotton producer during the 1940s, as farmers increasingly
turned to truck farming and raising poultry. The logging industry revived during that time, and
highway construction also helped to invigorate the economy; by 1945 US highways 96 and 190
were both paved. The population of the county grew to 20,049 by 1950 and to 22,100 by 1960.
Oil was first discovered in Jasper County in 1928, but production was minimal until the
1950s; subsequently, petroleum helped to stabilize the economy and provided the area with
welcome additional revenue, though not great wealth. Production was 4,560 barrels in 1948,
more than 202,600 in 1956, almost 770,300 in 1960, 486,400 in 1965, about 220,480 in 1974,
and almost 591,000 in 1982. In 1990, the county produced 835,816 barrels of crude, and, by
January 1991, almost 20,856,590 barrels had been produced in the county since 1928.
Angelina National Forest, within which the current project area is situated, surrounds
Sam Rayburn Reservoir off US Highway (US) 69 east of Lufkin, Texas. The preserve, which is
administered by the US Forest Service (USFS), with local headquarters in Lufkin, encompasses
a total of 153,176 ac, including 58,535 ac in Angelina County, 21,011 ac in Jasper County,
9,238 ac in Nacogdoches County, and 64,392 ac in San Augustine County (Miller 1984). The
national forests in Texas were established by an act of the Texas legislature in 1933,
authorizing the purchase of lands for the National Forest system. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt proclaimed these purchases on October 15, 1936. Angelina National Forest has
5 parks with campgrounds—Bouton Lake, Boykin Springs, Caney Creek, Harvey Creek, and
Sandy Creek. The area consists of pine and hardwood woodlands growing on flat to gently
rolling terrain. Facilities include boat ramps, hiking trails, and camping and picnicking areas.
Sam Rayburn Reservoir was constructed between 1956 and 1965 (Handbook 2008b).
Formerly known as McGee Bend Reservoir, this water-supply reservoir was renamed in honor
of Samuel T. Rayburn in 1963. The reservoir is designed for flood control and power generation

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated project area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
on the THC‘s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Park Service‘s (NPS) online
National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas State Historical Association‘s and the
General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin‘s Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a
program of intensive survey of the project area. No cultural resources were documented as a
result of this survey, so the second and third of these goals were not pursued. The rest of this
chapter presents the methodological background for the current investigations and the specific
survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to conducting the survey fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing archival
documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations conducted
in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural resource
properties in or near the survey area. Based on this archival research, no previously recorded
aboriginal or historic cultural resource sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1.0 mile [mi])
of the project area. The nearest previous cultural resource survey was conducted by Horizon
approximately 550 m (1,800 ft) south of the current project area for a similar HDD boring project
under the same USFS-owned tram road (Brownlow 2008). No previous surveys have been
conducted in the immediate vicinity of the current project area, and no previously recorded
cultural resources occur within the APE.

SURVEY METHODS

On February 5, 2010, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd, crew chief, and Jared
Wiersema, archeological field technician, under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. At the time
of the survey, the sky was clear and survey conditions were good. The APE is situated within a
moderately dense pine forest located near the northern end of the Angelina River arm of Sam
Rayburn Reservoir. The APE of the proposed undertaking consists of the entry and exit points
of the proposed HDD bore locations to the east and west of the abandoned tram road, each of
which cover an area measuring only approximately 0.01 ha (0.02 ac) in size, totaling 0.02 ha
(0.04 ac). The abandoned tram road under which the HDD bore would be conducted has been
excavated through the sloping distal end of the ridge finger, bringing it to grade, and the soil
push piles associated with this prior construction form a long, linear, earthen berm along the
western edge of the roadway that towers up to 6 m (20-ft) above the tram road grade (Figure 3).
West of the abandoned tram road ROW, the HDD bore location is situated in a moderately
dense forest composed of mixed pine and hardwoods. East of the abandoned tram road ROW,
the HDD bore location is situated in a low, marshy area that was saturated with water at the
time of the survey (Figure 4). Elevations within the project area range from 58 to 61 m (190 to
200 ft) above mean sea level (amsl); however, as noted, the natural topography of the project
area has been significantly altered by prior construction of the abandoned tram road grade.
The APE was traversed by Horizon‘s archeologists, and the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for historic and prehistoric cultural resources. As the project area is
situated within a longleaf pine forest, pine duff, underbrush, and grass obscured visibility of the
modern ground surface in many areas, and ground surface visibility was typically less than 30%.
Furthermore, the proposed HDD location east of the abandoned tram road was situated in a
low, marshy area, and access was partially restricted by the boggy conditions.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for cultural
resource surveys state that, for block-area surveys, a minimum of 3 subsurface probes (e.g.,
shovel tests, auger tests, backhoe trenches) be excavated per acre within APEs the size of the
current project area. The shovel testing density may be increased in areas with higher
probabilities to contain cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in areas with
low probabilities for cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland settings with
minimal soil cover. Horizon excavated a total of 4 shovel tests within the 0.01-ha (0.02-ac)
APE, including 2 shovel tests on the east and west sides of the abandoned tram road grade,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements (Figure 5). The Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using a Garmin Foretrex hand-held
Global Positional System (GPS) device based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
Shovel tests were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft), to the top of pre-Holocene
deposits, bedrock, or the local water table. Target depths were reached in the deep, sandy
sediments that composed the upland ridge west of the abandoned tram road ROW, though the
presence of a high water table east of the road forced early termination of shovel tests in this
area. Sediments appeared to be relatively intact aside from evidence of surface erosion and

artificial disturbances from prior construction of the abandoned tram road grade. No cultural
resources were encountered in any of the shovel tests. Appendix A presents the stratigraphy
and soil characteristics observed in the 4 shovel tests.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). While the project area is
situated adjacent to a riverine setting, it is situated on an upland landform that formed during the
Eocene, well before the introduction of humans in North America. Any cultural resources in the
project area would be present in surface or near-surface contexts; thus, shovel testing is
considered to represent an adequate and effective technique for assessing the presence of
cultural resources within the APE. Furthermore, the dense nature of the pine forest makes this
area inaccessible to heavy equipment.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a ―reasonable and goodfaith effort‖ to locate significant archeological sites within the project areas as defined in
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3, and the TSMASS shovel testing requirements
were exceeded for a project area of this size.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker‘s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same
location in which they were found. Modern roadside trash was fairly abundant throughout the
APE, but no historic or prehistoric cultural resources were observed during the survey, so the
collections policy was not brought into play.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This report documents the results of an intensive cultural resource survey of 1 HDD bore
entry/exit location along Eagle Rock EP‘s proposed natural gas pipeline ROW in south-central
Nacogdoches County, Texas. The HDD location would be utilized to install a segment of the
proposed pipeline under a 30-m- (100-ft-) wide abandoned tram road ROW owned by the
USFS. Although the HDD bore entry and exit locations are situated on private property adjacent
to the USFS-owned abandoned tram road and the undertaking is privately funded, the
installation of the proposed pipeline via HDD across property owned by the USFS would require
a Special Use Permit issued by the USFS. As such, the segment of proposed pipeline ROW to
be installed via HDD falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as
amended.
As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact
significant cultural resources, Eagle Rock EP was required to provide for a cultural resources
inventory and assessment of the project‘s APE and to evaluate the project‘s possible impacts on
any significant cultural resources in the APE. The APE of the proposed undertaking consists of
the entry and exit points of the proposed HDD to the east and west of the abandoned tram road,
each of which covers an area measuring only approximately 0.01 ha (0.02 ac) in size, totaling
0.02 ha (0.04 ac).
On February 5, 2010, Horizon archeologists Michael Mudd, crew chief, and Jared
Wiersema, archeological field technician, under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource
properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed project. The APE was traversed
by Horizon‘s archeologists, the modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for historic
and prehistoric cultural resources, and a total of 4 shovel tests were excavated within the APE,
including 2 shovel tests each on the east and west sides of the abandoned tram road ROW at
the HDD bore entry and exit locations, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a
project area of this size.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:
Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.
Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP evaluations.
At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objective is rather to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated
further in pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological
and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the
site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a function of
the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Archeological
resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of
archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the CFR in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The APE was traversed by Horizon‘s archeologists, the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for cultural resources, and a total of 4 shovel tests were excavated within
36

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a Proposed HDD Location
Under an Abandoned Tram Road in Nacogdoches County, Texas

the 0.02-ha (0.04-ac) APE, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of
this size. No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result
of the survey.

6.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the project area as a result of intensive survey
activities, and no previously documented cultural resources are present in the vicinity of the
project area that would be adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the USFS and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
