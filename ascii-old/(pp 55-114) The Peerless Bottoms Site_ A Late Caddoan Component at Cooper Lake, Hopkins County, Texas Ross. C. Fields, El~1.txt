The Peerless Bottoms Site: A Late Caddoan
Component at Cooper Lake,
Hopkins County, Texas

Ross C. Fields, Eloise F. Gadus, and L. Wayne Klement

ABSTRACT
In 1991, intensive excavations were carried out at the Peerless Bottoms site
(41HP175) at the Cooper Lake project in Hopkins County, Texas. The work
was done by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. under a contract with the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. The site lay in the upper 20-30 cm of a
soil buried beneath ca. 70 cm of sterile alluvium. The excavations revealed that
the cultural remains represent a single component occupation dating to the early
part of the Late Caddoan period (the A.D. 1400s). A single hearth and several
possible posts were identified, and large collections of lithic and ceramic artifacts and modest collections of faunal and macrobotanical remains were recovered. Most of the excavations sampled a hearth-centered outside activity area
associated with a sedentary or multiseasonal occupation by hunter-gatherers
who practiced limited horticulture.

INTRODUCTION
The Cooper Lake project in Delta and Hopkins counties, Texas (Figure 1),
has been the scene of archeological work since 1951 when a reconnaissance
survey was done by the River Basin Surveys of the Smithsonian Institution.
Between 1951 and the final episode of work in 1993, nearly 30 projects dealing
with prehistoric sites were completed by Southern Methodist University, the
University of North Texas, and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (see Fields et al.
1994 for a complete list). This work resulted in a large body of data, most of it
pertaining to intensive use of the upper Sulphur River valley over perhaps a
1,000-year span beginning in the Woodland period and ending in the Middle
Caddoan period at about A.D. 1300.
While artifacts indicating use during the Late Caddoan period have been
found in small numbers at many sites, isolable late components proved elusive
until 1991 when the Peerless Bottoms site, which was named for the nearby
community of Peerless, was excavated by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. under
contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (Fields et
al. 1993). This site was unusual not only because of its age but also because it

represented a single component occupation and because it contained wellpreserved information on intrasite structure. While Peerless Bottoms cannot be
considered typical of the kinds of Caddoan period sites that predominate at
Cooper Lake, it does provide valuable information about a little sampled time
period in the area, and it stands out as an important example of the value of single
component sites in northeastern Texas. This paper summarizes the excavations;
more detailed information, particularly for the artifacts, can be found in Fields et
al. (1993).

SITE SETTING
The Peerless Bottoms site (41HP175) is located at 420 ft above mean sea
level near the distal end of an alluvial fan extending northward along Finley
Branch into the flood plain of the South Sulphur River (Figure 2). The river is
730 m to the north, and the flood plain proper lies at an elevation of 416 ft. The
fan surface rises gently to an elevation of 440 ft at the base of the valley wall ca.

500 m south of the site. Immediately to the northeast of the site is the old channel
of Finley Branch, which was abandoned when the creek was channelized in the
early part of the twentieth century. The channelized creek is ca. 80 m west of the
main site area.
The site had been cleared shortly before the 1991 investigations. Prior to
this, much of the site was in pasture, although the areas along old Finley Branch
and just north of the site supported oak forest. This clearing and the subsequent
burning of brush and timber piles did not disturb the site itself, but it did disturb
parts of the fan just to the east and north. Other disturbances include an eroded
gully 1-2 m deep just south of the site, which probably occurred after Finley
Branch was channelized, and an eroded pasture road crossing old Finley Branch
on the north edge of the site.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Site 41HP175 was first recorded in 1989 (Jurney and Bohlin 1993). At that
time, a trackhoe was used to dig a trench 1-3 m deep between old Finley Branch
and the channelized creek, and cultural materials were discovered in the backdirt
near the eastern end of the trench. Two test pits were placed adjacent to the south
wall of the trench, and four units were dug north and south of the trench. These
excavations and screening of some of the trench backdirt yielded 331 chipped
stone artifacts and 137 sherds and indicated that the cultural remains are restricted
to a ca. 20 cm thick zone buried beneath ca. 70 cm of sterile alluvium. The
temporally diagnostic artifacts suggested a Late Caddoan age, which was
supported by a single calibrated radiocarbon assay of A.D. 1720 + 90 (SMU2326) on charcoal from an uncertain context.
The next effort at 41HP175 occurred in 1990 and consisted of a magnetometer survey (Bailey et al. 1991). This was done in anticipation of the 199t
intensive excavations. An area of 28 x 13 m south of the trackhoe trench was
surveyed, and eight magnetic anomalies were found. These were interpreted as
possibly representing modern metal or cultural features (e.g., small middens or
hearths), but they were difficult to assess because most were situated around the
edges of the surveyed area or near areas disturbed in the 1989 testing. Ultimately,
this survey did not provide much information that was useful during the later
intensive excavations because most of the magnetometer grid was effectively
outside the boundaries of the site (Ellwood and Fields 1993).

EXCAVATION STRATEGY AND
WO~ ACCOMPLISHED
The 1991 excavations were intended to define the horizontal and vertical
limits of the cultural deposits, obtain a systematic sample of the full extent of the

Fields et al. m The Peerless Bottoms Site

59

site, and intensively sample one or more concentrations of cultural materials.
This design focused on horizontal aspects of the site because of its geologic
context, which suggested that a limited span of time was represented, and the
likelihood that it contained a single component with the kind of preserved
information on internal site structure (i.e., the spatial arrangement of activities)
that cannot be recovered easily from multicomponent sites.
The first task consisted of cleaning out the 1989 trackhoe trench and
relating the stratigraphy observed in this exposure to the recovery of
archeological materials from the 1989 test units. This confirmed that the site
is contained within a discrete zone 10-30 cm thick buried beneath sterile
deposits, and it revealed that this zone is in the upper part of a generally
conspicuous buried soil. Further, it showed that the buried soil in the eastern
end of the trench is truncated by a filled channel of Finley Branch. With the
buried soil as a stratigraphic marker, Backhoe Trenches 1-10 were dug to
explore the horizontal extent of the cultural deposits, document the thickness
of the sterile overburden, and follow the course of the filled channel (Figure
3). Then, Excavation Units 1-18 were placed at roughly 5-10 m intervals across
the site area. The overburden was removed to within 10-20 cm above the buried
soil in these units, at which point manual excavations began in 10 cm levels.
To ensure sampling of the full thickness of the archeological deposit, these units
extended an average of 63.3 _+ 15.3 cm in depth (40-100 cm). This effort
revealed that appreciable quantities of cultural remains were present in a
restricted area of less than 500 m2 south of the trackhoe trench, south and west
of old Finley Branch, and east of Backhoe Trench 4 (see Figure 3). Only 3
percent of the 1,039 artifacts recovered from these initial units were from
outside of this core area.
The second phase of the excavations consisted of the manual removal of
Excavation Units 19-36 scattered across this core area (Figure 4). Most of these
units were 5 m apart, and along with the initial units placed in this part of the site,
they sampled most of the area on a staggered 5 m grid. Following removal of the
overburden, the manual excavations were done in 10 cm levels and extended an
average of 35.6 +_ 6.2 cm in depth (20-40 cm). This effort located a single hearth
(Feature 1 in Excavation Unit 21) and revealed that the core area of 41HP175
contained a single predominant concentration of archeological materials in its
eastern half (around Feature 1) and a small part of a second concentration in its
northwestern corner (see Figure 4). This second concentration was sampled only
by Excavation Units 14 and 36, although it was roughly quarter-sectioned by the
tracldaoe trench and Backhoe Trenches 4 and 5.
The third phase of the excavations consisted of opening 66 additional units
around Feature 1 (Figure 5). Following removal of the sterile overburden to ca. 5
cm above the buried soil, these full and partial units were dug manually in 10 cm
levels to an average of 31.1 + 3.1 cm in depth (30-40 cm). This block was
expanded until the limits of the concentration of materials around Feature 1 were
defined, except on the north where the block was bounded by the filled channel.

Counting the units dug in the first two tasks described above, the block covered a
total of 67.7 m2.
The final excavation task consisted of using a Gradall to strip ca. 78 m2 of
the site in five areas just southeast, south, and west of the block (see Figure 5).
This was done to search for cultural features, but none were found. The sediments were removed to just below the cultural zone, and the floors were shoveled
and troweled. Unlike the sediments from the other excavations, the sediments
from the Gradall units were not screened.
Concurrent with all of the excavation phases were geomorphic investigations. This entailed examination and recording of backhoe and trackhoe trench
walls, excavation of Backhoe Trenches 11-26 to document the extent and geometry of the deposit containing the archeologica! remains, and excavation of

SEDIMENTS AND STRATIGRAPHY

Sediment Descriptions
Eight formal profile descriptions were done, three of which are summarized
here to characterize the site sediments. Profile A, which was on the south wall of
the trackhoe trench 1.7 m east of Backhoe Trench 4, typifies the upper deposits
(Figure 6). The upper 15 cm consists of a brown friable silt loam to loam Ap
horizon. An A horizon consisting of dark grayish brown firm loam underlies this
at !5-35 cm. Between 35 and 67 cm is a very dark grayish brown firm clay loam
to loam B horizon. The underlying zone, at 67-90 cm, contains the cultural
deposits. It is a very dark gray to black clay loam to silty clay loam with
moderate fine subangular blocky structure; it is classified as a 2A horizon. A
radiocarbon assay on humates from this zone yielded a corrected age of 890 + 60
B.P. (Beta-48210; raw 14C age = 880 + 60 B.P.; 6t3C = -24.3), which in conjunction with the dates on the archeological materials from the site (see Dating)
suggests that this soi! developed over a period of at least several hundred years.
A 2AB horizon was recorded between 90 and 115 cm, and it consists of a
dark grayish brown friable silty clay loam with weak fine subangular blocky
structure. The lowermost zone, at 115-130+ cm, consists of a black extremely
firm silty clay loam to silty clay with moderate subangular blocky structure; it is
classified as a 3A horizon. A radiocarbon assay on humates from this lower soil

yielded a corrected age of 3620 + 60 B.P. (Beta-48211; raw 14C age = 3450 + 60
B.P.; 8~3C = -14.7); this implies soil development over a long span of time and
slow aggradation of the fan during much of the Late Holocene.
Profile C, which was on the south wall of the ta’ackhoe trench 8.4 m east of
Backhoe Trench 4, documents a filled channel, presumably an abandoned channel of Finley Branch, that cut through the upper buried soil and into the lower
one (see Figure 6). The uppermost zone, at 50-80 cm below the modern ground
surface (the upper 50 cm was excavated prior to recording of the profile),
consists of a brown friable silt loam with a gradual lower boundary. This zone
correlates stratigraphically with the B horizon of the surface soil in Profile A.
The three underlying zones constitute channel fill deposits and are classified as
2C horizons. Zone 2 at 80-122 cm consists of a dark grayish brown firm silt
loam, and Zone 3 at 122-177 cm is a dark gray firm loam. Both of these upper fill
zones are heavily mottled and contain charcoal fragments, and silt lenses (the
most conspicuous of which are shown in Figure 6) increase in frequency downprofile. The lowermost channel fill deposit, at 177-213 cm, consists of alternating lenses of very dark gray clayey sand and silt. These deposits are heavily
mottled and contain rare burned rocks, bones, burned clay lumps, and charcoal
fragments. A radiocarbon assay on charcoal from this zone yielded a corrected
age of 590 + 60 B.P. (Beta-48864A~TH-8896), which suggests that this channel
began filling before or during the early part of the primary occupation of the site
(see Dating). The abrupt lower boundary of this zone marks the base of the
channel.
The primary sedimentary structures in the three channel fill zones become
less distinct toward the edges of the channel, and this, along with the extreme
amount of animal burrowing noted in the profile just west of the channel, makes
it difficult to discern stratigraphic relationships precisely. Nonetheless, it is clear
that the channel was abandoned and filled before the culturally sterile sediments
above 41HP175 were deposited. Based on this, it is surmised that the upper
sediments (i.e., the Ap, A, and B horizons in Profile A) were deposited by
overbank flooding of Finley Branch flowing in a channel approximating the one
that borders the site on the northeast.
The lowermost zone in Profile C, between 213 and 290 cm, is a dark gray
very firm clay loam with moderate to strong subangular blocky structure. This is
a 3B horizon associated with the lower buried soil documented in Profile A.
The lower alluvial fan deposits were exposed in Backhoe Trenches 27 and
28, with the latter providing the most informative view. The upper 168 cm in
Backhoe Trench 28, which was in the bottom of the old Finley Branch channel,
consists of alternating layers of brown loam and silt to fine sand; these represent
channel fill modified by pedogenesis, and this zone is classified as an AC
horizon. At 168-250 cm is a mottled yellowish brown and gray silty clay. This
appears to be overbank deposits, and it is a 2C horizon. Between 250 and 282 cm
below the bottom of the old channel is a mottled dark grayish brown and dark
gray silt loam with medium moderate subangular blocky structure. This is

Fields et al. ~ The Peerless Bottoms Site

65

classified as a 3A horizon. It lies ca. 445-477 cm below the modern ground
surface in the core part of 41HP175. A radiocarbon assay on humates from this
lowest documented soil yielded a corrected age of 9710 + 110 B.P. (Beta-48212;
raw 14C age = 9570 + 1t0; 813C = -16.5), which implies a moderate rate of
sedimentation for this part of the fan during the Early to Middle Holocene.
Beneath this soil at 282-326+ cm is a mottled yellowish brown to grayish brown
loam 3C horizon.

Landform Geometry and Topography
The modern topography of 41HP175 is characterized by a low natural levee
running along the left bank of the old channel of Finley Branch (see Figure 3).
Thus, the modern surface and the immediately underlying deposits (i.e., the
culturally sterile alluvium above 41HP175) are related to this channel. The
buried soil containing 41HP175 shows a different topography consisting of a
low, generally east-west ridge offset ca. ! 5 m south of the modern levee (Figure
7). While this ridge parallels the filled channel exposed in the trackhoe trench
and Backhoe Trenches 5, 8, and 10, it is not adjacent to the channel. Hence, the
ridge does not appear to be a levee associated with this channel. Rather, it
appears that the depositional unit containing the site (except for perhaps its
uppermost part) was laid down by flooding of an undocumented channel and that
cutting of the filled channel postdated this depositional event. Figure 7 also
shows that the main part of 41HP 175 (the area of the excavation block and just to
the northwest) was situated between the ridge crest and the creek channel, and a
cross-section view of the landform reveals that the buried soil containing the site
thickens in this area. This may indicate slightly more rapid deposition in this area
than elsewhere.

DATING

The vertical distribution of the cultural remains, i.e., restricted to the upper
20-30 cm of the 2A horizon, and the geologic setting in an aggrading alluvial fan
suggest that a limited span of time may be represented by the deposits, and this is
supported by most of the 11 radiocarbon assays from archeological contexts
(Table 1). Four of the radiocarbon assays are from features, two on nutshells
from Feature 1 and two on wood charcoal from Features 3 and 8. The remainder
are on composite nutshell samples from general fill contexts in various parts of
the excavation block and from the secondary concentration of cultural materials
northwest of the block (Excavation Unit 36).
While Figure 8 shows long 1-sigma ranges for some of the calibrated
assays, most of the samples overlap to some degree between A.D. 1400 and
1450, and thus it appears that the site was used mostly during the early part of the
Late Caddoan period. This is consistent with the very high ratio of arrow to dart

points (31.5:1), the relatively high percentage of ceramics with shell temper
(40.6 percent), and most of the typeable arrow points (2 Bassett, 1 Catahoula, 8
Cliffton, 8 Fresno, 1 Homan, 31 Perdiz, 1 Rockwall, 1 Steiner, 4 Talco, and 33
Turney).
Three dates stand out as being earlier, however. The earliest one (A.D. 10431253) is from Feature 8. Given the likelihood that this feature represents a burned
stump (see Features), this assay probably is not relevant to understanding the
chronology of the site. The other two dates certainly are relevant, though, as
they are from Feature 1, the hearth that lies at the center of the concentration of
cultural materials sampled by the block excavation. These two assays may be
interpreted in two primary ways: (1) Feature 1 dates to the latter part of the A.D.
1200s, based on the near-overlap in the 1-sigma ranges (A.D. 1221-1272 and
1277-1404); and (2) Feature 1 was used multiple times during the A.D. 1200s,
1300s, and 1400s. As presented below (see Distributions and Conclusions), however, there is evidence to suggest that neither of these interpretations is correct
and that Feature 1 belongs with the A.D. 1400s occupation of the site. In brief,
this evidence involves consistent distributional patterns indicating that 41HP175
represents a single component occupation with activities focused around the

Fields et al. n Tile Peerless Bottoms Site

69

Feature 1 hearth. Based on this interpretation, at least one of the radiocarbon
assays from Feature 1 appears to be erroneous.
Two additional kinds of chronometric data were obtained, an
archeomagnetic date from Feature 1 and three thermoluminescence assays on
sherds. The archeomagnetic date provides some support for the contention that
one of the radiocarbon dates from Feature 1 is too old, as one of the two possible
date ranges (A.D. 1100-1150 and 1360-1380) is consistent with the later radiocarbon assay (Ellwood 1993). The thermoluminescence samples, analyzed by
Dr. Robert C. Dunnell at the University of Washington, consist of two plain
grog-tempered body sherds (A.D. 1251 + 92 and A.D. 1251 + 91) and a brushed
grog-tempered body sherd (A.D. 1261 + 64), with an assay on a shell-tempered
body sherd yielding anomalous and unusable results. These dates are difficult to
interpret given most of the radiocarbon assays. They may be consistent with the
early date from Feature 1 suggesting use during the A.D. 1200s, but the large
standard deviations extend their 2-sigma ranges into the late A.D. 1300s or early
A.D. 1400s. Given the distributional evidence discussed below and most of the
radiocarbon evidence, these thermoluminescence assays appear not to be fully
reliable.
In short, there is limited artifactual evidence (the four Catahoula, Homan,
Rockwal!, and Steiner arrow points and perhaps the few dart points), radiocarbon
evidence (at least one of the assays from Feature 1), and thermoluminescence
evidence suggesting site use during the Early to Middle Caddoan periods. Nevertheless, the majority of the arrow points (50 percent are late triangular forms and
37 percent are probably late stemmed forms), the high incidence of shell tempering and the ceramic types represented (Avery Engraved, cf. Ripley Engraved, cf.
Simms Engraved, cf. Taylor EngravedAVilder Engraved, and Nash Neck-Banded/
McKinney Plain~mory Punctated), and most of the radiocarbon assays indicate
occupation during the Late Caddoan period.

FEATURES

Of the eight features recorded, two (Features 2 and 4) were later judged to
be non-cultural, while one (Feature 7) was determined to be a fortuitous concentration of ceramics, bones, and other artifacts; these three are not discussed
further here. Of the five other features, three are small semicircular to rectangular
charred wood concentrations (Features 3, 5, and 6), one is a large piece of
charred wood (Feature 8), and one is a large burned clay hearth (Feature 1).

Feature 1
Feature 1 consists of a large concentration of burned clay with associated
soil oxidation, and it is identified as a burned clay hearth. This feature was
encountered in Levels 2 and 3 of four adjacent units (see Figure 5), with some

70

staining extending slightly into Level 4. The overall concentration is roughly
oval in shape, encompassing ca. 160 x 180 cm area (Figure 9). It contains several
smaller concentrated areas of burned clay, most of which appear to represent in
situ burning, and burned clay lumps and nodules are scattered throughout. Ash
deposits were not noted. Two primary soil zones exhibiting varying degrees of
oxidation were observed in cross section (see Figure 9). No pit outline or prepared basin was observed, and it appears that the hearth represents fires built on
the ground surface. The size of the feature and the presence of several areas of
concentrated burning suggest multiple episodes of use.
A total of 2,265.5 g of burned clay and 1.0 g of burned clay with stick or
grass impressions was recovered from the feature fill. Eleven burned mud-dauber
nests and several nest fragments (total weight = 88.3 g) also were recovered. Six
of the burned mud-dauber nests exhibit stick and/or grass impressions. The other
materials recovered from the fill consist of 1 manufacture-broken distal biface
fragment, 3 plain grog-tempered body sherds, 11 pieces of unmodified debitage,
2.8 g of burned rocks, 3.5 g of faunal remains (2 box turtle shell fragments and 2
unidentified bones), and 25.4 g of macrobotanical remains. The analyzed macrobotanical remains consist of 1 maize cupule, 1 squash rind fragment, 1 hackberry
seed, 240 hickory nutshells, 348 unidentified nutshells, 23 Pediomelum (formerly Psoralea) root or cortex fragments, 18 pieces of Carya wood charcoal, and
7 pieces of unidentified wood charcoal. Among the more distinctive artifacts
found immediately around Feature 1 are the following: five arrow points typed as
Turney (n = 3), Bassett (n = 1), and Cliffton (n = 1), with one of the Turney
points coming from Level 4 below the elevation of the feature and the other four
points coming from Level 2 above or just within the upper limits of the feature;
and parts of two Avery Engraved vessel sections (Vessels 22 and 23), three
sherds of two Nash Neck-Banded vessel sections (Vessels 31 and 34), and one
sherd of a red-slipped but otherwise undecorated carinated bowl with a crenelated
lip (Vessel 26).

Features 3, 5, and 6
Features 3, 5, and 6 are pieces of charred wood that exhibit the cross-section
grain of the wood in plan view. They are situated 0.3 m south-southwest, 0.8 m
north-northeast, and 1.9 m south of Feature 1 (see Figure 5). In Feature 3, a
single rectangular piece measuring 4 x 6 cm and extending 3 cm vertically was
encountered first. About 9 cm beneath this, two crescent-shaped pieces measuring ca. 2 x 6 cm and 1 x 6 cm in plan and extending ca. 6-7 cm vertically were
found lying 20 cm apart. Feature 5 consists of a single rectangular piece measuring 4 x 5 cm and extending only 1.5 cm vertically. Feature 6 is a single semicircular piece measuring 5 x 7 cm and extending 2.5 cm vertically. Outlines of
disturbances (e.g., posthole margins) were not visible around any of these, and
no associated staining or oxidation was observed. The only artifact recovered is a

The indistinct nature of these features limits interpretations, but the visible
wood grain in all three cases shows that they were oriented vertically, and thus
they could represent the remains of posts or stakes that were charred prior to
placement to retard rotting. Feature 3, with the most numerous pieces of charcoal, could be a single large (ca. 25 cm diameter) post or two small (ca. 7-9 cm,
based on the curvature of the crescent-shaped pieces) posts or stakes. A cultural
interpretation also is supported by the proximity of all three features to Feature 1.
The absence of discernible postholes favors a non-cultural interpretation, however, and thus they may simply represent burned roots.

Feature 8
Feature 8, ca. 1.9 m east of Feature 1 (see Figure 5), consists of a large piece
of charred wood that exhibits the cross-section grain of the wood in plan view. It
measures 8 x 11 cm in plan, extends 10 cm vertically, and exhibits a roughly
rectangular cross section. No posthole-like outline, soil staining, or oxidation
were observed. The only recovered’materials consist of 496.1 g of charred wood
identified as oak root. A radiocarbon assay on this charcoal yielded a 1-sigma
date range of A.D. 1043-1253. This early date and the identification of the
charcoal as a root indicate that Feature 8 is non-cultural, but the distributional
data suggest that this feature, in conjunction with others, served to structure the
use of space at 41HP175 (see Distributions and Conclusions).

CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS
Arrow Points
Of the 126 arrow points recovered, 50 are complete and 76 are fragmentary.
Fifty-four have use-related breaks, 22 have indeterminate breaks, one is exhausted, and 49 show no technological reason for discard. The majority (n = 94)
are of fine-grained quartzite, followed by medium-grained quartzite (n = 26).
The remaining points Consist of three specimens each of coarse-grained quartzite
and chert. Reworking is evident on 76 of the points.
Forty-seven of the complete arrow points and 43 of the fragmentary specimens can be typed, while three of the complete points and eight fragments can be
grouped into five descriptive categories. The identified types (Figure 10) are
Bassett (n = 2), Catahoula (n = 1), Cliffton (n = 8), Fresno (n = 8), Homan (n =
1), Perdiz (n = 31), Rockwall (n = 1), Steiner (n = 1), Talco (n = 4), and Turney
(n = 33), while the descriptive groups are Broad Contracting Stem (n = 1), Basalnotched Contracting Stem (n = 5), Bulbar Stem (n = 1), Triangular with Concave
Base (n = 3), and Triangular with Convex Base (n = 1). The remaining 25
specimens are too fragmentary to be typed or placed into descriptive groups.

Arrow Point Preforms

Included under this heading are 43 arrow point blanks and preforms and/or
arrow points broken in manufacture. Of these, four are complete and 39 are
fragmentary. The majority (n = 39) are of fine-grained quartzite, followed by two
of medium-grained quartzite, one of coarse-grained quartzite, and one of chert.
None exhibit evidence of reworking. Thirty-one were broken during manufacture, while eight have indeterminate breaks; of the remaining specimens, three
were discarded due to manufacturing difficulties (e.g., step fractures, knots, etc.),
and one shows no technological reason for discard.

Dart Points
Only four dart points were recovered. Two are complete, while the remaining two are a medial fragment and a barb fragment. Three are made of finegrained quartzite, and the other is of medium-grained quartzite. Grinding is
present on the stem of only one specimen, while reworking is evident on three.
The two complete dart points are typed as Gary (see Figure 10n), while the
remaining two are untypeable fragments.

Dart Point Preforms
Included in this category is a single specimen identified as a possible dart
point preform. It is a proximal fragment of fine-grained quartzite, exhibits a
manufacture break, and lacks any evidence of grinding or reworking.

Gouges
Twenty-nine gouges and gouge fragments were recovered. Sixteen are complete. Most (n = 21) are made of fine-grained quartzite, while six are of mediumgrained quartzite, and two are of chert. Use wear was recorded on 15, while haft
wear is evident on five specimens. Seven gouges exhibit use-related breaks, three
have indeterminate breaks, and three were broken during manufacture; of the
remainder, two appear to have been discarded as a result of manufacturing
difficulties, one is exhausted, and 13 show no technological reason for discard.
Three of the gouges contain a dark brown to black residue which may represent
resin or asphaltum used in hafting. Five are small triangular forms with minimal
shaping or ventral face resharpening (Figure 1 la), 16 are small triangular forms
with moderate to substantial shaping or ventral face resharpening (Figure 1 lb),
two are small triangular forms with moderate to substantial shaping or ventral
face resharpening and recurved lateral edges due to haft shaping, three are badly
fragmented small triangular specimens, one is a large triangular specimen with
minimal shaping or ventral face resharpening, and the remaining two are large

triangular forms with moderate to substantial shaping or ventral face

Bifaces
A total of 103 bifaces and biface fragments that were discarded in the early
to middle stages of reduction and four bifacial tools and tool fragments that could
not be grouped into any of the other formal tool categories were recovered. Of
the four tools, two are complete and two are proximal fragments. All of these
are late reduction stage bifaces. The two complete specimens are of fine-grained
quartzite. They are asymmetrically subtriangular to triangular in shape, with one
lateral edge that is greater in length than the opposite edge (see Figure 1 lc, d).
Both specimens show pressure flaking and use wear and no technological reason
for discard. In addition, both exhibit evidence of haft wear, and both have traces
of dark brown to black residue that may represent resin or asphaltum used in
hafting. These items appear to have functioned as cutting tools or knives but
also may have been used as scraping implements. The third tool is missing only
a small portion of the distal end and appears to have been broken as a result of
use (see Figure 1 le). It is relatively long and narrow and is made of fine-grained
quartzite. It exhibits use wear and evidence of haft wear, and the primary working
edge has relatively well patterned pressure flaking. Small traces of possible
asphaltum or resin were also noted. It appears to have been used primarily as a
bifacial knife. The last tool is of medium-grained quartzite (see Figure 1 lf). This
specimen exhibits use wear, pressure flaking, and an indeterminate break type.
It may have been used as a cutting tool and/or scraping implement.
Most of the specimens under this heading (n = 103) are bifaces broken or
aborted in the early or middle stages of reduction. Only nine of these are
complete. Discard and break patterns indicate that 43 were broken during
manufacture, and nine were discarded due to manufacturing difficulties; the
remaining 51 have indeterminate breaks. The majority (n = 71) are of fine-grained
quartzite, 25 are of medium-grained quartzite, six are of coarse-grained quartzite,
and one is of chert. Forty-four exhibit edge grinding. Pressure flaking is present
on 13 specimens, it is absent on most (n = 84), and it is indeterminate on six
others. Given the nature of this group of bifaces, the presence of edge grinding
and/or pressure flaking is likely related to platform preparation rather than use
as tools. In addition, none of the bifaces in this group show evidence of use
wear.

Un~faces

A total of 103 unifaces and uniface fragments was recovered. Most of these
(n = 59) are classified as expedient unifaces, 30 are formal unifaces, and 14 are
uniface edge fragments. Of the formal unifaces, 24 are end scrapers (Figure 12),

four are side scrapers, one is a combination end and side scraper, and one is an
indeterminate uniface. Eighteen of the formal unifaces are complete. Most (n =
24) are made of fine-grained quartzite, and six are of medium-grained quartzite.
All of the end scrapers and three of the side scrapers have single working edges,
while the remaining three specimens have two working edges. An analysis of
discard and break patterns indicates that seven are use broken, eight appear to
be exhausted, five have indeterminate breaks, one was discarded because of
manufacturing difficulties, and the reason for discard on the remaining nine could
not be discerned. Use wear is present on 25 specimens. Most of these (n = 20)
also have evidence of haft wear. In addition, 17 exhibit traces of possible asphaltum or resin that may have been used in hafting.
The majority of the expedient unifaces (n = 40) are classified as side scrapers, one is an end scraper, nine are combination end and side scrapers, and nine
are gravers. Of the side scrapers, seven have pointed projections and may have
functioned also as engraving tools, one has a concave scraping edge which suggests use as a spokeshave, and two have both pointed projections and concave
scraping edges. Twenty-three of the expedient unifaces are complete. Thirtyseven are of fine-grained quartzite, 20 are of medium-grained quartzite, one is
of coarse-grained quartzite, and one is of chert. Twenty-seven have single working edges, 17 have two working edges, 13 have three working edges, and two
gravers have four or more working edges. One specimen exhibits a manufacture
break, while the break type could not be assessed confidently on most (n = 35);
the remainder show no technological reason for discard. Use wear is present on
43 specimens, and none have evidence of haft wear.
The remaining unifaces (n = 14) are edge fragments. Of these, nine are of
fine-grained quartzite, two are of medium-grained quartzite, two are of coarsegrained quartzite, and one is of chert. Eleven have single working edges, and
three have two working edges. Break causes could not be assessed confidently.

78

Texas Archeological Society

Use wear is present on 10, while haft wear could not be discerned on any of the
fragments.
Cobble Tools
Seven cobble tools were recovered. Four are complete. One is of finegrained quartzite, two are of medium-grained quartzite, three are of coarsegrained quartzite, and one is of silicified wood. All seven have single working
edges. One has a use-related break, two have indeterminate breaks, and four
show no technological reason for discard.
Four of the cobble tools are relatively large and appear to have been used in
chopping tasks. One is cortex backed, and two exhibit battering on the proximal
ends. All four are bifacially shaped, although the single complete specimen
exhibits minimal modification from the parent core. Three of the chopping tools
have step fracturing and rounding on the working edges. The remaining three
cobble tools are smaller and appear to have been used as wedges. All three are
complete and have cortex-backed proximal ends. In addition, all of the wedges
have evidence of battering on the cortex-backed ends.
Edge-modified Flakes
Seventy pieces of edge-modified debitage were recovered. Of these, 28 are
complete flakes, 21 are proximal flakes, 19 are chips, and two are edge-modified
chunks. Most (n = 63) are of fine-grained quartzite, while six are of mediumgrained quartzite, and only one is of chert. Secondary flakes (specimens that
have cortex on 1-99 percent of their dorsal surfaces) make up 53 percent of the
edge-modified flakes (n = 36), tertiary flakes account for 46 percent (n = 31), and
a single edge-modified primary flake accounts for the remaining 1 percent. Of
the two edge-modified chunks, cortex is present on one specimen and absent on
the other. The majority of the edge-modified debitage (n = 52) exhibit single
working edges, while 16 specimens contain two utilized edges, one has three
utilized edges, and one has four working edges.
Cores
A total of 219 cores and core fragments was recovered. Almost all of these
are of quartzite (n = 216); 149 are of fine-grained quartzite, 65 are of mediumgrained quartzite, and two are of coarse-grained quartzite. The three cores of
non-quartzite materials consist of two chert specimens and one of silicified wood.
The mean number of flake scars is 3.0 + 1.9 with a range of 1 to 14 scars.
Unmodified Debitage
The excavations recovered 13,365 pieces of unmodified debitage. A sample
of 6,043 specimens was analyzed, consisting of all debitage from alternating

Fields et al. ~ The Peerless Bottoms Site

79

units in the excavation block. A limited set of attributes (raw material, flake type,
maximum dimension, dorsal cortex percentage, and chunk cortex presence/
absence) was recorded for 5,075 specimens. For the remainder of the analyzed
sample, consisting of all 968 specimens from seven randomly chosen units, three
attributes concerning platform characteristics (platform cortex, platform grinding,
and platform facet count) were also recorded.
The analyzed debitage consists of 17 percent complete flakes, 14 percent
proximal flakes, 69 percent chips, and 1 percent angular chunks. By far the most
common material type is quartzite, with fine-grained quartzite representing 76
percent of the sample and medium-grained quartzite constituting 23 percent. Few
specimens are of other raw materials, with 0nly 1 percent being coarse-grained
quartzite and less than 1 percent each being chert, silicified wood, novaculite,
and miscellaneous materials. Most of the debitage is in the 11-20 mm size
category (73 percent), and the next-largest class is 21-30 mm (20 percent).
Relatively few specimens measure 1-10 mm (4 percent) and 31-40 mm (3
percent), and even fewer are 41-50, 51-60, and 61-70 mm (<1 percent each). Just
over half (53 percent) of the complete flakes, proximal flakes, and chips are
tertiary (have no cortex). Specimens with cortex on 1-50 percent of their dorsal
surfaces constitute the second-largest category (31 percent), while 15 percent
have 51-99 percent dorsal cortex and 1 percent are primary. Among the angular
debitage, 82 percent retain some cortex. Of the fully analyzed flakes (n = 315),
86 percent have single-faceted platforms, 10 percent have two facets, and 3
percent have or three or more facets. Platform grinding and platform cortex each
are present on 24 percent of the platforms.
The debitage from 41HP175 indicates that local quartzites, and especially
fine-grained quartzites, were the favored materials for chipped stone tool production, almost to the exclusion of other materials. Differences in attributes
between the raw materials are minor, the most notable being that the fine-grained
quartzite debitage tends to be relatively small and decorticate compared to the
coarser-grained materials. This reflects the more intensive reduction of the finergrained materials (i.e., they tended to be carried further through the reduction
sequence). The extreme infrequency of specimens of chert and novaculite indicates that tools of these materials probably were resharpened but not manufactured on site.

CERAMICS

A total of 3,823 ceramic sherds was recovered. Ceramic crumbs make up
1,868 of these, and due to their small size they were not analyzed. Eight nonvessel ceramic fragments also were recovered, and they are discussed separately
below. The analyzed vessel ceramics number 1,947 sherds. They are described
under two headings below. The first discusses the entire sherd collection, and the
second discusses the vessels reconstructed from the more distinctive sherds.

80

Texas Archeological Society
Vessel Sherd Descriptions
The three primary types of temper in the sherds are grog, shell (most of

which has been leached away), and bone. Grog is the sole tempering agent in
over half (n = 1,108) of the sherds, while 773 sherds have only shell temper.
Bone temper alone occurs in just one sherd; 41 sherd have grog and bone, 16
have grog and shell, and eight have no temper.
The maximum dimensions of the analyzed sherds range from 1.1 to 12.0
cm, but the majority (n = 1,566) are less than 4.0 cm. Sherds that exceed 4.0
cm total 381 and form 20 percent of the analyzed sample. This relatively large
percentage of sizable sherds probably can be attributed to the discrete
occupation and limited trampling. The sherds range in thickness from 0.30 to
1.78 cm (2 = 0.66 _+ 0.17). The majority (n = 1,646) fall between 0.40 and 0.80
cm. Most of the body/base and base sherds, however, are somewhat thicker (X
= 1.10 _+ 0.29 cm). Of these, those with leached shell temper are slightly thicker
(2 = 1.25 _+ 0.24 cm) than those with grog temper (2 = 0.91 _+ 0.23 cm).
Body sherds make up the vast majority (n = 1,739) of the collection, rims
number 176, and the remainder (n = 32) are base sherds. Over half of the rims
are large enough to indicate form. Of these, 57 are everted, 24 are inverted,
and 10 are straight. The inverted rim forms are dominated by exterior rolled
lips (n = 10), with five rims having tapered lips, four having flat lips, and one
having a rounded lip. The everted rims have a more even distribution of lip
forms (18 exterior rolled, 14 rounded, 13 flat, nine tapered, and three indeterminate). Straight rims are evenly split between tapered (n = 4) and flat (n = 4)
lips, with two sherds having exterior-rolled lips. CrenelaLed lips occur only on
inverted rims (n -- 4) and on one rim of indeterminate form. Most of the base
sherds are too small to give an indication of form, but some of the more distinctive grog-tempered and leached shell-tempered specimens are flat bases
with simple contours, while a few leached shell-tempered sherds are suggestive of flowerpot-shaped forms.
Sherds with red-slipped surfaces number 103, while three sherds have a
white slip. Seventy-nine are body sherds, 26 are rims, and one is a body/base
fragment. Most (n = 92) are slipped on both their interior and exterior surfaces,
with 12 having only exterior slipping and two having interior slipping. An
additional nine sherds have red pigment within incised or engraved lines.
Decorated sherds comprise 21 percent (n = 411) of the analyzed ceramics.
Decorated shell-tempered specimens are relatively infrequent (n = 15), possibly
because of the higher frequency of exterior surface erosion. Engraving (n = 167)
and fingernail punctating (n = 113) are the most common decorative techniques,
followed by brushing (n = 66), appliqued fillets or nodes (n = 23), fingernail
punctating with appliqu~ (n = 15), incising (n = 14), stick punctating (n = 6),
cord impressing (n = 3), pinching (n = 2), and brushing/impressing (n = 2).

Vessel Descriptions
At least 54 vessels are represented. The 269 sherds assigned to vessels
constitute 14 percent of the collection, and most of the remaining sherds probably
represent portions of the undecorated bodies of the identified vessels. Thirty-nine
vessels are represented by rim or body sections large enough for classification
based on form. A variety of forms are identified, including carinated bowls,
simple bowls, deep bowls, bottles, globular jars, and cylindrical jars (Figure 13).

Carinated Bowls
Twelve vessels are carinated bowls (Table 2). All but two are grog tempered, with one of the grog-tempered vessels also containing bone. The other two
have leached shell temper and soft silty pastes with light gray to black cores and
light gray to light yellow brown surfaces. The exterior walls of both vessels are
eroded, but Vessel 42 does retain some evidence of smoothing on the interior
wall. The grog-tempered vessels have moderately hard pastes with generally
light gray to black cores. The core colors of Vessels 26 and 52 differ from those
of the other grog-tempered vessels in that they are red brown and yellow brown,
respectively. Wall colors vary from black to dark brown to yellow brown on
most vessels. In a few instances, it is clear that post-depositional weathering has
affected wall color, with eroded vessel walls exhibiting yellow to yellow brown
coloration. In the cases of Vessels 15 and 17, light yellow sherds were refitted to
chocolate brown vessel sections. Only Vessel 26 is red slipped. Burnishing is the
most prevalent surface finish, occurring on both the interior and exterior surfaces
of all but four (Vessels 12, 42, 43, and 52) of the grog-tempered vessels.
Everted, inverted, and straight rim forms are represented in the carinated
bowls. Vessels 26, 42, and 52 (see Figure 13) stand out in that they have rims that
tend toward the narrow, sharply inverted form characteristic of Simms Engraved
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:141). The lip of Vessel 26 is also unusual in that it is
crenelated (Figure 14a), and like the lip on Vessel 52, it is oriented almost at a
fight angle to the rest of the rim. The lips on the majority of the rest of the grogtempered vessels are exterior rolled. There appears to be no correlation between
lip form and rim orientation. Nine of the 12 vessels have rim sections large
enough to permit a diameter measurement. These range from 11.0 to 38.0 cm,
with seven (58 percent) ranging from 22.0 to 29.0 cm. Mean wall thickness for
all the vessels in the group ranges from 0.48 to 0.79 cm. No association between
the size of the vessel and the thickness of the vessel wall is apparent.
Rim decoration is similar in both technique and element/motif for the
majority of the vessels in this group. All except the Simms-like bowls and the
leached shell-tempered bowls, which are plain, have an engraved slanted scroll
or scroll motif encircling the vessel from the lip to the carination. A slanted scroll

is a derivation of the classic scroll, one example of which is found on Vessel 13
(Figure 14b). The slanted scroll consists of two parallel diagonal lines that define
an empty space flanked by two areas filled with circular or linear elements. In
some cases the diagonal empty space is bisected by a single diagonal line. The
slanted scroll and its flanking areas form a rectangular panel which may have
been repeated several times around the circumference of the vessel. Unlike some

Fields et al. m The Peerless Bottoms Site

87

slanted scroll motifs such as those found on some Ripley Engraved and Taylor
Engraved vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 64a and b, Plate 75i, 1, and o), the
slanted scrolls from 41HP175 appear to deemphasize spiral or circular elements
at the ends of the scroll. On Vessel 15, where the end of the slanted scroll is
preserved, the diagonal appears to terminate in a rectilinear fashion. In two other
examples (Vessels 6 and 12), the diagonals end abruptly at the horizontal lines
that define the edges of the decorated panel.
Three different element configurations are found as panel fillers flanking
the diagonal scrolls on these carinated bowls. Vessels 15 and 17 have concentric
semicircles separated by crosshatching or vertical lines and graded in size according to their position along the diagonal (Figure 14c). Another configuration
is size-graded ovoid elements separated by curved vertical lines, straight vertical
lines, or crosshatching. This is found on Vessels 7, 8, 11, and 12 (Figure 14d).
The last configuration occurs only on Vessel 6, and it consists of curved vertical
lines spaced at specific intervals (Figure 14e). Red pigment is contained in the
engraved lines of the slanted scroll on Vessel 6.

Simple Bowls
Six vessels can be classed as simple bowls. Vessel 48 is the only one within
this group to have a restricted orifice (see Figure 13). All except Vessel 48 are
grog tempered, and all have moderately soft pastes. Vessels 14, 16, and 36 have
exterior and interior surface colors of light gray to grayish brown and gray to
black cores. Vessels 24 and 25 have red-slipped exterior and interior surfaces.
Vessel 24 has a yellow brown core, and Vessel 25 has a light gray core. Vessel
48 has leached shell temper with a light orange brown exterior, a light yellow
brown interior, and a light yellow brown core. The exterior surfaces of the grogtempered vessels are burnished. The interior surfaces are burnished (Vessels 14
and 16), smoothed (Vessel 36), or too eroded to indicate treatment (Vessels 24
and 25). Vessel 48 is smoothed on the exterior and roughly smoothed on the
interior. The rim forms follow the restricted or unrestricted nature of the vessel
forms; only Vessel 48 has an inverted rim while the other five have everted or
straight rims. Two have lips that are exterior rolled, three have rounded lips, and
one has a tapered lip. Rim diameter could be determined for four vessels, ranging
from 11.0 to 30.0 cm. Mean wall thickness for the six vessels ranges from 0.50 to
0.73 cm. The two smallest vessels in this group, Vessels 14 and 48, fall within
the middle of this range.
All five of the grog-tempered bowls are decorated with engraving which
starts just below the lip and appears to be confined to the rim. The decorative
element on red-slipped Vessels 24 and 25, as well as on Vessel 16, consists of
zoned crosshatching which probably is part of a slanted scroll motif. The zoned
crosshatching on Vessel 24 surrounds a circular element (Figure 15a). Vessel 14
has a band of evenly spaced sets of three vertical curved lines encircling the

vessel just below the lip (Figure 15b). The vertical curved lines offsetting panels
of empty space are reminiscent of the motifs found on the carinated bowls
described above. Vessel 36 has a decorative motif that appears to contain two
roughly parallel bands of haphazardly executed horizontal curved lines encircling the rim (Figure 15c), but because less than 10 percent of the rim is present,
it is difficult to identify the full design. The leached shell-tempered bowl, Vessel
48, appears to be undecorated. This vessel does have a curious uneven lip edge
which, if repeated around the entire vessel, would have given the orifice a widely
scalloped effect.

Deep Bowls
All four deep bowls are grog tempered, have moderately soft pastes, and are
red slipped. The slipping on some of the sherds of Vessels 22 and 30 has faded to
an orange color probably as a result of weathering. Core colors are dark gray on
Vessels 22, 23, and 29, while Vessel 30 has a light brown core. The interior and/
or exterior surfaces are burnished, polished, or finely smoothed; Vessel 29 has an
eroded interior surface. Three of these bowls have everted rims, two with tapered
lips and one with a rounded lip. No rim sherds clearly associated with Vessel 30
were recovered. Two vessels with everted rims are represented by sections large
enough to establish rim diameter. In both cases, the median rim diameter is
greater than 30 cm. Wall thicknesses range from 0.65 to 0.71 cm.

Fields et al. m The Peerless Bottoms Site

All four deep bowls are decorated with incised or engraved designs in a
band 3-8 cm high that encircles the vessel just below the lip. Three have a similm"
motif within the band consisting of nested chevrons surrounding a circular
element set off by hatching. The chevrons are also separated by ladder-like
diagonals (Figure 16a). This motif is a rectilinear form commonly associated
with the type Avery Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:1-4; Perino 1983:52).

Vessel 29 has a 3 cm wide decorative band encircling the rim with an unusual
motif consisting of open rectilinear panels juxtaposed with areas of haphazardly
executed diagonal lines (Figure 16b). This motif is vaguely reminiscent of the
Avery Engraved chevrons.

Collared Bowl
Vessel 35 is a leached shell-tempered bowl whose form is unique among the
vessels identified from 41HP175. It is represented by a 15.3 cm section of rim
with a tapered inward-curving lip which is almost at a right angle to the straight
rim (Figure 16c). The vessel section retains enough of the body wall to show a
slight restriction just below the rim, thus forming a collared rim. The restriction
does not significantly reduce the orifice size relative to the maximum diameter of
the body, however. The paste of Vessel 35 is similar to that of the other leached
shell-tempered vessels from the site in that it is moderately soft and dark gray to
yellow brown on the outer surfaces and a gray core. The vessel has been smoothed
on both the interior and exterior surfaces. Its diameter is 26.0 cm, and its mean
wall thickness is 0.65 cm. The only decoration is a faint horizontal cord impression which encircles the vessel at the base of the collar.

Bottles
Only two vessels can be identified as bottles based on the arc of the
shoulder and neck sherds present. All of the interiors are scraped but otherwise
unsmoothed. Since few matches occur between the sherds of either vessel, the
reconstruction of vessel shape is problematic (see Figure 13). A large shoulder
section from Vessel 21 suggests, however, that at least this bottle had a short,
squat body similar to those associated with Ripley Engraved or Wilder Engraved
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:127-130, 155-156). Both vessels are grog tempered, but
they differ in hardness and paste color. Vessel 21 is hard and has dark gray
surfaces and a black core, while its exterior surface exhibits a high polish. Vessel
33 also has a black core, but its wall surfaces are gray on the interior and light
yellow with gray clouding on the exterior and its paste is moderately hard. Its
exterior surface is eroded, and a determination of exterior surface treatment is not
possible.
Both vessels appear to have engraved curvilinear decorations; on Vessel 21,
the decoration extends from just below the neck to over the edge of the shoulder.
Small triangular excised areas occur where two curving lines intersect, although
pendant triangles characteristic of Ripley Engraved are not present. Red pigment
is present in some of the engraved lines on this vessel. Vessel 33 has large areas
of excising between areas that have concentric curving lines. Although the
designs on both vessels are fragmentary, they are suggestive of the concentric
scroll designs found on Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved (Suhm and Jelks

Fields et al. ~ The Peerless Bottoms Site

91

1962:149-152, 155-156). Specifically, the excising at the intersection of curving
lines of the scroll motif occurs on bottles from both of these types.

Globular Jars
Three vessels are globular jars (see Figure 13). All have leached shell
temper and moderately soft pastes. Paste colors are light gray to yellow gray on
the exterior surfaces with gray cores. Both Vessels 47 and 50 have eroded
surfaces, and finishing treatment cannot be determined. Vessel 44, however,
appears to have been smoothed on both its interior and exterior surfaces. These
jars have both everted and inverted rim forms with flat or tapered lips. The
vessels with rims large enough to provide measurements are 15.0 and 22.0 cm in
diameter, and wall thicknesses range from 0.56 to 0.73 cm.
All three of the jars appear to be undecorated except for the occurrence of
appliqu6d nodes on Vessel 47. These nodes occur in pairs just below the juncture
of the neck and the body. A sherd with paired nodes was recovered which
appears to be part of this vessel but which could not be refitted to the vessel
section, suggesting that paired nodes were spaced around the circumference of
the vessel. These globular jars with inverted or everted rims, decorative nodes,
and leached shell temper are suggestive of the Nocona Plain, Woodward
Appliqu6, and Woodward Plain types (Brown 1971:141-146; Suhm and Jelks
1962:115-116).

Cylindrical Jars
All eight of the vessels classed as cylindrical jars are grog tempered. Surface colors for most range from light to dark gray, although a few, such as
Vessels 39 and 49, have orange brown exterior surfaces suggesting that they
were fired in an oxidizing atmosphere. Cores are gray to black in all cases. Most
have moderately hard pastes, but Vessels 31 and 32 are harder than the rest. Both
of these have light gray exterior surfaces and dark gray interiors with brittle
pastes. While the interior surface of Vessel 38 is the typical light gray color, its
exterior surface is a cream color which, viewed in cross section, appears as a thin
layer that is suggestive of a slip.
Six of the eight have roughened exterior surfaces. The interiors of these six
are mainly smoothed, but Vessel 37 is burnished and Vessel 40 is polished.
Vessel 34 has a smoothed exterior and a polished interior, and Vessel 49 is
burnished on both its exterior and interior surfaces. All but one have everted
rims, while the rim form for Vessel 40 is indeterminate. Flat, exterior rolled,
and rounded lips are present on these vessels. The rim diameters range from
27.0 to 37.5 cm, with four diameters greater than 30 cm. Assuming that these
jars were at least as tall as their maximum rim diameters, as is the case with
Nash Neck-Banded jars (Skinner et al. 1969:55; Suhm and Jelks 1962:114), then

92

Texas Archeological Society

these vessels appear to have been quite large. Wall thicknesses range from 0.55
to 1.10 cm.
The main decorative techniques used on the cylindrical jars are fingernail
punctations, pinching, and appliqu6d fillets or nodes. All except Vessel 49,
which is undecorated, are punctated (Figure 17a), pinched, or appliqu6d (Figure
17b) from the lip to the constriction of the rim. The punctated and pinched
decorations have been smoothed to varying degrees to give a roughened texture.
Body decoration can be confirmed for only one vessel in this group. Although
highly fragmentary, it appears that Vessel 34 has vertical lines of punctations
interspersed with vertical appliqu6d fillets, both of which extend down the body
from the rim constriction. These decorative treatments are common on vessels
typed variously as Nash Neck-Banded, McKinney Plain, and Emory PunctatedIncised (Perino 1981, 1983; Skinner et al. 1969; Suhm and Jelks 1962:97-98,
111-112).

Small Cylindrical Jars
Vessels 1, 41, and 54 are classed as small cylindrical jars (see Figure 13).
All three are grog tempered with moderately hard pastes that are gray brown on
the surface and gray to black at the core. The surface treatment of these vessels
consists of smoothing on the exterior and burnishing on the interior. No rim was
recovered for Vessel 1, but both Vessels 41 and 54 have everted rims with
exterior rolled lips, and both have rim diameters of 16.0 cm. Wall thicknesses
range from 0.38 to 0.64 cm.
The decorative elements common to these small jars are fingernail punctations and appliqu4d fillets and nodes. Vessels 41 and 54 have fingernail punctations below the rim which have been smoothed to produce a neck-banding
effect (Figure 18a). Vessel 41 also has an appliqued fillet positioned at the juncture between the rim and the body. It appears from the straight horizontal break

/

that the sherds recovered from Vessel 1 represent a section from just below the
juncture of the rim and body. Two appliqued fillets extend from the juncture to
fonn a V-shaped area filled with three lines of appliqued nodes (Figure 18b). A
vertical fillet is also present to the side of this V-shaped area. It is likely that
alternating V-shapes and vertical fillets encircled this vessel. In addition, horizontal rows of slanted fingernail punctations apparently encircled the vessel at
regularly spaced intervals, and horizontal appliqued fillets bounded the zone of
punctations. The decorative elements on all three jars are found on vessels of
similar form associated with the types Nash Neck-Banded, McKinney Plain, and
Emory Punctated-Incised (Perino 1981, 1983; Skinner et al. 1969:43, 52; Suhm
and Jelks 1962:97-98, 111-112).

Indeterminate Vessels

The size and shape of fifteen vessels could not be determined. Six are
represented by body sherds alone, while nine are represented by only one rim or
body sherd. Four have leached shell tempering. All of these have moderately soft
pastes with light gray to yellow gray surfaces and dark gray cores. Where the
exterior and interior surfaces are not eroded, they are smoothed. Rim forms that
could be determined are inverted, everted, or straight, and lip forms are rounded
or flat. The sherds of these vessels have a mean thickness ranging from 0.57 to
0.81 cm. Vessel 45 has two horizontal rows of roughened fingernail punctations
around its rim, while Vessel 10 has an unidentified motif containing straight
engraved lines. The characteristics of these vessels suggest that, given the recovery of larger vessel sections, they would probably be grouped with the globular
jar vessel category.
Vessel 27 also has leached shell temper but with the addition of a small
amount of grog. This red-slipped vessel has a light gray core and a moderately
soft paste. Its interior surface is eroded, but the exterior appears to have been
finished by smoothing. Decoration on Vessel 27 appears to be limited to the
body, but it is possible that erosion of the surface of the rim has obscured
decoration on that part of the vessel. The decorative technique used consists of
curvilinear engraved lines and excised areas. The decorated area is too small for
an identification of the motif, but a scalloped element offset by excising, apparently representing a border for a circular or oval panel, is present on one body
sherd. This element is similar to those associated with a curvilinear motif found
on the type Avery Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 1).
The remaining vessels in the indeterminate category are grog tempered.
Five of these (Vessels 2, 3, 4, 19, and 20) have gray brown exteriors and gray
cores. Vessels 5 and 9 have gray to dark gray exteriors with black cores. Vessel
53 has a tan paste both at the surface and at the core, and Vessels 28 and 51 are
red slipped while their cores are black and orange brown, respectively. The
majority of the vessels have moderately soft pastes; the exceptions are Vessels 9
and 53 which have moderately hard pastes. Most of these vessels are more highly
finished on their interior surfaces. Only four have associated rims; three of these
are everted (two with exterior-rolled lips and one with a rounded lip), and one is
inverted (with an exterior-rolled lip). The mean thickness of these vessels ranges
from 0.58 to 1.00 cm.
The decorative techniques associated with the grog-tempered indeterminate
vessels are fingernail punctations (Vessels 2, 3, 4, and 53), stick punctations with
engraving (Vessel 5), and engraving or incising (Vessels 19, 20, and 28). Vessel
51 is represented only by undecorated rim sherds. Of the fingernail-punctated
vessels, Vessels 2 and 53 have horizontal rows of punctations around the rim
(with Vessel 53 having a roughened rim), Vessel 3 has diagonal rows of punctations extending from the lip, and Vessel 4 is represented by three body sherds
that are covered by a field of random punctations. Vessel 5 appears to have zones

Fields et al. m The Peerless Bottoms Site

95

of stick punctations demarcated by multiple parallel diagonal engraved lines. The
single sherd representing this vessel has too little of the design to determine the
motif or a specific ceramic type. Vessel 9 is represented by two body sherds
which have intersecting sets of parallel lines probably representing a slanted
scroll motif. Vessels 19 and 20 have parallel curved lines with pendant triangles.
Although these vessels have the same element!motif, a difference in the design
execution is evident. The elements on these vessels are similar to elements on
Ripley Engraved vessels (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 65e, g, and h). Vessel 28 is
represented by one body sherd which has an engraved circular element above a
horizontal line. This is similar to elements from curvilinear Avery Engraved
motifs (Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 2a).

Non-vessel Ceramics
Seven pipe fragments and one ceramic bead were recovered. The pipe
fragments consist of one stem and six bowl fragments. The stem appears to be
complete, measuring 2.72 cm from its attachment point with the bowl and 1.06
cm in diameter (Figure 19a). The proximal end of the stem appears finished, and
thus it is too short to be classified as a long-stemmed Red River pipe (Hoffman
1967; Newell and Kreiger 1949:147-149), unless the stem has been broken and
reworked. This specimen appears to be tempered with shell, and it has a smoothed
exterior finish. The bowl fragments consist of two grog-tempered specimens,
two specimens with leached shell temper, and two temperless specimens. The
grog-tempered fragments, which are the only bowl fragments with intact lips,
have rounded lips. Both fragments are polished on the exterior. They measure
0.49 and 0.53 cm in thickness. The bowl fragments with leached shell temper
have eroded or smoothed surfaces and measure 0.51 and 0.55 cm in thickness.
The temperless fragments have eroded exterior surfaces and measure 0.33 and
0.36 cm in thickness. Most of the bowl fragments are too small to determine
bowl orientation. One of the leached shell-tempered fragments is large enough to
suggest that it was part of a flaring bowl of an elbow-shaped pipe. The stem of
this pipe did not extend beyond the distal end of the bowl.

The single ceramic bead is 3.0 cm long and 1.9 cm in diameter (Figure 19b).
The exterior surface is eroded and appears to have one broken end as a result of
heat spalling. The long axis of the bead is pierced by an oval hole that is 0.6 cm
in diameter. The paste is fine and temperless.

NON-CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS
Thirty non-chipped stone artifacts were recovered. These are fashioned
from a variety of materials and exhibit several kinds of use wear or manufacture
marks, including grinding, pitting, pecking, battering, and grooving. Often more
than one kind of use wear or manufacture mark is evident on a single artifact
suggesting that these tools served multiple functions. Six artifact types can be
distinguished: grinding stones (n = 4), pitted stones (n = 9), hammerstones (n =
10), abraders (n = 5), a celt (n = 1), and a lump of worked kaolin (n = 1).
One of the grinding stones is an end fragment of a tabular ferruginous
sandstone slab with one ground surface. Two are quartzite cobbles with single
flat surfaces showing evidence of smoothing and polishing, suggesting use for
grinding. The edges are also battered, suggesting that they were used as pulverizers. One of these is fragmentary, but both appear to be of a size that could
have been hand-held. The fourth specimen is a large hematite metate. It is tabular
with one concave working surface which exhibits extensive smoothing and
polishing.
The pitted stones are tabular or rounded quartzite cobbles with large central
pits on one or more flat surfaces. These stones may have been used as anvils for
cracking hardwood nuts. Three have two pits, one on each opposite flat surface.
The pits appear to have been made by pecking. Whether the pecking was done
initially to establish the pit or whether the pit resulted from use is unclear. Two of
these artifacts have striations or shallow grooves intersecting the pit. Again, it is
unclear whether these striations helped to establish the pit or whether they are
use related. The surfaces around the pits on three other artifacts exhibit evidence
of grinding and polishing. All of the pitted stones have crushed spots around their
edges. This evidence of crushing suggests that the pitted stones also were used
for battering.
The hammerstones are cobbles with crushing and battering along their
edges exclusive of any evidence of grinding, pecking, or polishing. Nine are
quartzite and one is silicified wood. Four of the abraders are small chunks of
ferruginous sandstone with one or more flat ground surfaces and one or more
deep grooves. The fifth abrader differs in that it is tabular, and it has a concave
working surface. Several shallow grooves cross the length of its working surface.
A reworked portion of a quartzite celt was also recovered (Figure 20). It has been
flaked on both its dorsal and ventral faces at the broken proximal end, perhaps to
reduce its thickness and facilitate hafting. The lateral edges have been pecked
while the bit edge has been finely ground. The final artifact under this heading is

a ground piece of kaolin; it is generally tabular with rounded and faceted edges,
striations across the fiat surfaces, and a shallow depression in the center of one
fiat surface.

FAUNAL REMAINS
A total of 2,062 vertebrate faunal remains was recovered; invertebrate
remains were not found. Fourteen taxa are present in the 14 percent of the
collection (n = 305) that is identifiable taxonomically (Yates 1993). The bestrepresented taxon is white-tailed deer (n = 155), with other mammals including
deer/pronghorn (n = 46), large mammal (n = 21), cottontail (n = 3), opossum
(n = 1), raccoon (n = 1), pronghorn (n = 1), bison (n = 1), and cow/bison/elk
(n = 1). Also present are indeterminate turtle (n = 45), box turtle (n = 17), slider
turtle (n = 7), mud turtle (n = 3), and large bird (n = 3). While small, the
collection suggests primary reliance on animals taken from woodland, woodland-edge, and aquatic habitats within the Sulphur River valley. Grassland taxa
are present only in small numbers. Modification indicating use as tools or ornaments is present on 22 specimens as follows: 11 grooved bison (?) rib fragments
possibly representing a musical rasp (Figure 21a); two possibly worked antler
fragments; five awl fragments; one beamer; two turtle shells with scrape marks;
and one bone pin (Figure 21b).

MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS
A total of 1,098.2 g of macrobotanical remains was recovered from general
fill contexts, from features, and from flotation column samples. Of these, 318.4 g
are burned nutshells, 773.8 g are wood charcoal, and 6.0 g are other charred

materials. Submitted for identification and analysis were all materials from six
units and 12 other general fill contexts in the block (155.0 g, excluding 15.2 g
used for dating), all materials (525.4 g, excluding 28.0 g used for dating) from
the screened fill of three features (Features 1, 3, and 8), the light fraction of the
flotation sample from Feature 1, and the light fractions of two flotation column
samples (Dering 1993).
Feature 1 yielded one maize cupule, one squash rind fragment, one hackberry seed, 240 hickory nutshells, 348 unidentified nutshells, 23 fragments of
PediomeIum (formerly Psoralea) root or cortex, 18 pieces of Carya wood charcoal, and seven pieces of unidentified wood charcoal. The maize and squash are
the only cultigens found at the site, and their sparseness suggests that subsistence
pursuits focused on wild plant foods rather than cultivated ones. Feature 8 was
found to consist of a large quantity of burned oak root wood, while the wood
charcoal from Feature 3 was unidentifiable. The sample from general fill contexts contains three honey locust seeds, two water locust seeds, 931 hickory
nutshell fragments, 33 pecan nutshells, four black walnut nutshells, two oak
nutshells, and 126 unidentified nutshells. These remains support the conclusion
that wild plant foods were of primary importance. The wood charcoal in the
general fill samples consists mostly of oak (n = 159), with elm (n = 50), Carya
(n = 29), locust (n = 12), yaupon (n = 8), and unidentified wood (n = 35) making
up the remainder.

OTHER MATERIALS
Fire-cracked Rocks
A total of 27.6 kg (n = 1,860) of fire-cracked rocks was recovered from nonfeature proveniences. Quartzite cobbles and cobble fragments make up the vast
majority (27.1 kg, n = 1,833), while limestone (<0.1 kg, n = 7), sandstone (0.4
kg, n = 15), and unidentified materials (<0.1 kg, n =5) are much less frequent. A

Fields et aL m The Peerless Bottoms Site

99

single piece of burned quartzite weighing just 3 g was recovered from a feature
context (Feature 1). Although these fire-cracked rocks were differentially distributed across the excavation block (see Distributions and Conclusions), they were
not clustered into recognizable features, and it is presumed that they represent
debris removed from Feature 1 or, perhaps more likely, from an undiscovered
hearth or processing feature.

Burned Clay
A total of 4.7 kg of burned clay lumps was recovered. Most of these
materials (3.9 kg) lack impressions, but the remainder (0.8 kg) exhibit grass,
twig, or rarely stick or cane impressions. Almost none of the impressed specimens (1.0 g) but much of the unimpressed ones (2.3 kg) are from the Feature 1
hearth, with the remainder being from general fill contexts. The burned clay
lumps from non-feature proveniences are generally small (1-3 cm in diameter),
while those from Feature 1 are 1-7 cm in diameter. The bulk of these materials
represent sediments incidentally fired during hearth use. Some of the impressed
specimens could represent daub from a wattle-and-daub structure, but this is not
clearly the case.

Mud Dauber Nests
Sixty-three fragments of mud dauber nests weighing 184.7 g were recovered. In all, 22 nest fragments (88.3 g), many of them large and well preserved,
were associated with Feature 1, the hearth found near the center of the excavation
block; most of the remainder were recovered just west of Feature 1. The preservation of the mud dauber nests is due to the fact that they had been fired,
presumably within the hearth.
Mud dauber is an appellation for the common black and yellow wasp of the
genus Sceliphron. This wasp is active from spring to fall constructing its nest of
mud in which it lays its eggs. Mud for the nest is gathered from pools or stream
edges and transported to the nesting site (Andrewes 1969:41-44). Nests are
composed of 4-20 cells, each containing a single egg. The wasp places as many
as 20 spiders in each cell to serve as food for its hatching larva. Once the wasp
has provided an adequate food supply, it closes the cell with a cap of mud. The
larva will hatch inside the closed cell, eat, and mature into the pupa stage,
emerging as an adult wasp the following spring (Andrewes 1969:41-44).
In natural settings, mud daubers place their nests in hollow trees or under
cliff overhangs (Evans and Eberhard 1970:102). Mud daubers select these nest
sites because they provide shelter from the elements which would damage the
nests and endanger the larvae during the several months they need to reach
maturity. The shelters provided by overhangs and niches in human-built structures also are utilized by mud daubers. Construction of the nest begins with the

100

Texas Archeological Society

wasp laying down a foundation of mud. This foundation fills in irregularities in
the surface to which the nest is attached and provides a flat surface on which
individual cells are built. Cells are built by adding concentric rings of mud. After
a number of cells are built, the wasp smears a final coating of mud over them
giving them a unified appearance (Evans and Eberhard 1970:104-106).
The nest fragments from 41HP175 have from one to seven cells, with most
having two to four. The majority of the surviving cells are closed, which may
suggest that the nests were burned after they were sealed and before the wasps
emerged (i.e., late fall to early spring). Unsealed cells are probably more fragile
than sealed ones, however, and thus they may be underrepresented because of
poor preservation rather than the season at which they were deposited.
Most of the larger nest fragments from 41HP175 have impressions
composed of two elements on one side. Specifically, they appear to have
contained grass or small sticks, usually emerging from a series of scalloped
depressions. These two elements are suggestive of a wattle-and-daub surface,
with the sticks and grass representing wattle showing through deteriorating, pockmarked daub as represented by the scalloped depressions. A second alternative,
that the stick impressions indicate that the nests were attached to brush piles or
dead wood which was used as fuel, is inconsistent with the kinds of impressions
observed, particularly the scalloped depressions from which the stick and grass
impressions emerge. In addition, this interpretation does not take into account
the nesting habits of Sceliphron, which, as noted above, prefer well-protected
nesting sites. It is doubtful that brush piles would afford adequate protection
from the elements.
While the impressions on the nests provide some positive evidence for a
structure at the site, it is difficult to be certain about how the nests ended up in the
Feature 1 hearth. Several explanations are offered here. First, it is possible that
parts of a dilapidated wattle-and-daub structure were used as fuel in the hearth,
thus resulting in the introduction of the mud dauber nests. Second, it is possible
that the nests were intentionally thrown into the fire, perhaps as a result of
structure cleaning and maintenance. And third, it is possible that the nests were
attached to a non-domiciliary structure, such as a ramada, that stood over Feature
1 and that burned, thus preserving the nest fragments. While this last scenario
would not explain the concentration of nests only in and adjacent to the hearth
itself, it is consistent with the possible burned posts or stakes recorded around
Feature 1 (see Features).

Unworked Rocks
Materials recovered from 41HP175 that may have been brought to the site

or burning consist of hematite/limonite, sandstone fragments, and siliceous
cobbles and pebbles. A total of 472.0 g of unworked hematite/limonite was

recovered, all from non-feature proveniences. These range in weight from 0.5
to 217.5 g. Some of the smaller specimens may be naturally occurring
concretions, hut several proveniences produced fragments that appear to be the
remains of larger chunks smashed during excavation, and these larger chunks
clearly were transported onto the site, perhaps for use as pigment sources.
Unworked and unburned sandstone, all from non-feature contexts, totals 268.5
g. Most are small fragments which range in weight from 0.5 to 9.5 g. The four
largest fragments range in weight from 20.5 to 90.0 g and make up most of the
collection. All of these are rounded and friable, and it is likely that they were
once part of larger pieces brought to the site to be used as abraders or as
hearthstones. The unmodified cobbles and pebbles consist of one cobble (>64
ram), one very large pebble (33-64 mm), and two small-medium pebbles (<17
mm). The two larger specimens are probably minimally used hammerstones or
pulverizers used on soft materials; the small-medium pebbles may be natural or
cultural.

DISTRIBUTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Because the cultural deposits at 41HP175 are restricted to the upper ca. 20
cm Of a buried soil within a Holocene alluvial fan and yielded radiocarbon assays
and artifacts suggestive of occupations primarily during the early part of the Late
Caddoan period, the site was analyzed as a single unit. Although no midden
staining was observed, the high frequencies of lithics and especially sherds, with
the latter representing at least 54 ceramic vessels, point to intensive use. The lack
of a midden comparable to those at many of the Early Caddoan components at
Cooper Lake probably can be attributed to the shorter span of time over which
41HP175 was occupied and the limited number of occupational episodes. Limited reoccupation also is indicated by the large size of many of the sherds and the
small size of the site.
Appreciable quantities of cultural materials are restricted to an area of less
than 350 m2, and within this small area there are two concentrations of remains.
The first covers ca. 150 mz in the eastern part of the core area and was the focus
of the excavations; most of the conclusions about the site are based on this
eastern concentration. The second, which covered at least 25 m2 and perhaps as
much as 50 mz in the northwestern comer of the core site area, received relatively
little attention. While little is known about this second area, the radiocarbon
dates and the artifact distributions discussed below show that it was associated
with the area sampled by the block excavations. At the time of the primary
occupation, this core area was bounded on the north by a recently abandoned
channel of Finley Branch, and it is likely that the channel bordering the site on
the northeast was the active channel.
Only five potential cultural features were recorded in or around the excavation block sampling the eastern part of the core area. One of these, Feature 1, is a

102

large unprepared hearth at the center of the eastern concentration. The other four
are concentrations of wood charcoal located south, east, and north of the hearth.
The visible wood structure in all four cases indicates *.hat they were oriented
vertically, but otherwise they are difficult to interpret. None are associated with
disturbances interpreted as postholes, and the cultural origins of all four features
are questionable. Nonetheless, it is surmised that three (!.q’eatures 3, 5, and 6)
could have been posts or stakes. The fourth, Feature 8, appears to represent a
burned tree stump. Such a limited assemblage of features would appear to
indicate that this part of the site was not used in an intensive fashion, but such an
interpretation is at odds with the high densities of artifacts encountered. An
explanation for this anomaly lies in the functional nature of the part of the site
sampled by the block, and this can be explored by examining the horizontal
distributions of the cultural remains.
Figure 22 shows the distributions of the chipped stone artifacts within the
excavation block. The most striking distribution is that of the unmodified debitage, which has a crescent-shaped distribution encircling Feature 1 on the south
and east and encompassing Features 5, 6, and 8. Most of the other categories
display distributions that are at least partly similar, but there are notable differences. For example, cores are especially common south and southeast of Feature
1, but they are abundant also north and northwest of the hearth. Manufacturebroken shaped tools also are frequent southeast and south of Feature 1, but they
are concentrated in an arc west of the hearth as well. Unbroken shaped tools are
abundant east, southeast, and south of Feature 1, but they are also frequent near
the western edge of the block and northwest of the hearth. Use-broken formal
tools are similar to manufacture-broken tools in that they are common southwest
and west of the hearth, but they are unusual in that they have high frequencies
just northeast and east of Feature 1 and conspicuously low frequencies to the
southeast. Finally, expedient tools (i.e., modified flakes and minimally modified
unifaces) have a more patchy distribution, being especially common east, south,
and west of Feature 1.
Burned rocks are distributed in a manner similar to some of the chipped
stone artifact categories in that they have a high density arc around the eastern
and southern sides of Feature 1, but they are also abundant north and west of the
hearth (Figure 23). Conversely, the vertebrate faunal remains exhibit a distribution unlike that of any of the lithic artifact classes, being abundant only north,
northwest, and west of the hearth. Burned nutshells are similar to the faunal
remains in that they occur in high densities at the western edge of the block and
to a much lesser degree just west and north of Feature 1, but they are notably
infrequent elsewhere. Ground and/or pitted stones and hammerstones, while
infrequent overall, also have distributions unlike the chipped stones. The former
are concentrated west of Feature 1, especially at the western edge of the block
(cf. burned nutshells) and northeast of the hearth, while the hammerstones occur
most commonly along the north edge of the block. The vessel ceramics are
similar to most of the chipped stone categories in that they exhibit a high density

arc southeast and south of Feature 1, but they also are quite frequent west of the
hearth.
More-detailed information on the ceramics can be gained by examining the
distributions of some of the vessel batches. Figure 24 shows the distributions
within the excavation block of the eight largest batches, in which the number of
sherds ranges between 10 and 32. While most of the sherds in these batches are
concentrated to a significant extent, most batches also contain sherds that are
fairly dispersed. Vessel 49, a large plain grog-tempered cylindrical jar, has the
most concentrated distribution, occurring entirely within the high density arc
southeast of Feature 1. Most of Vessel 47, a shell-tempered globular jar with
appliqu6d nodes, was found in roughly this same part of the block, although a
single sherd came from north of Feature 1. Vessel 33, an engraved grog-tempered bottle, also was concentrated in this area, but fair numbers of sherds were

found northward east of Feature 1; a single sherd in this batch came from the
concentration west of Feature 1. Vessel 34, a grog-tempered cylindrical jar typed
as Nash Neck-Banded, occurs almost solely west of Feature 1. Vessels 1, 23, 32,
and 39 (a small grog-tempered jar typed as Nash Neck-Banded, a grog-tempered
Avery Engraved deep bowl, a grog-tempered cylindrical jar with appliqu6, and a
grog-tempered cylindrical jar typed as Nash Neck-Banded) were found primarily
in this area and secondarily in the concentration south or southeast of the hearth
and/or in or just north of Feature 1.
These distributions show at least moderate movement of sherds across the
site, including movement between the ceramic concentrations south and west of
the hearth. This is indicated also by the fact that the mean distance over which
the 16 vessel batches with five or more sherds from controlled excavations are

distributed is 6.9 + 3.3 m. One of these batches (Vessel 11) contains sherds from
Excavation Unit 36 in the northwest corner of the core site area, ca. 14-15 m
from where the remainder of the sherds were found in the excavation block, and
additional long-distance matches between the block and outlying units can be
found in four of the smaller vessel batches (Vessel 17: Excavation Unit 30, 12 m;
Vessel 27: Excavation Unit 14, 14 In; Vessel 40: Excavation Unit 4, 22 m; and
Vessel 41: Excavation Unit 15, 11 m). Two other possible long-distance matches
were found by comparing the ceramics from the 1989 test excavations with those
reported here. One sherd probably belonging to Vessel 26 was found in the
backdirt near a 1989 unit just northwest of Excavation Unit 8, ca. 13 m from
where most of the Vessel 26 sherds were found in the excavation block. And a
sherd probably belonging with Vessel 23 was recovered from the backdirt at the
eastern end of the trackhoe trench (from the filled channel?), ca. 10 m north of
most of the Vessel 23 sherds in the block.
In combination with the relatively large size of many of the sherds and the
fact that only 3 of the 54 reconstructed vessels are represented by as much as
one-third of their rim portions, these distributions lead to four main conclusions.
First, they establish the relatedness of the two main concentrations of ceramics in
the block. Second, they show that the concentration of materials in the northwest
corner of the core area is associated with that sampled by the block. Third, they
show that substantial quantities of the materials deposited on the site were not
recovered in the excavations, with the most likely locations for these remaining
deposits being the northwest corner of the core area, the area just west of the
block, and the filled channel just north of the block. And fourth, they show that
the occurrence of sherds across the site probably has as much to do with the
transportation of parts of broken vessels for discard or reuse as it does with in situ
pot breakage and dispersal by foot traffic.
In the aggregate, the distributional evidence suggests a high degree of
spatial patterning within the block at 41HP175. All of the cultural materials
appear to be distributed around the hearth, with especially high densities of many
classes of remains occurring at a distance of 2-4 m from the edges of Feature 1,
especially to the south and east. Such a pattern is strongly reminiscent of the sorts
of hearth-centered activity areas documented in ethnoarcheological studies
(Bartram et al. 1991; Binford 1978; O’Connell et al. 1991).
The ring of debris (i.e., debitage, cores, manufacture-broken tools, unbroken tools, use-broken tools, expedient tools, burned rocks, and vessel ceramics)
situated 2-4 m from the southern and eastern sides of Feature 1 may represent a
consistently used discard zone for activities performed immediately adjacent to
the hearth. That this ring encompasses Features 5, 6, and 8 suggests that these
features served to structure the use of space around the hearth, perhaps as
supports for a brush arbor or other non-domiciliary structure. Certainly, the
presence of burned mud dauber nests with grass and twig impressions supports
the conclusion that some sort of structure stood over Feature 1, and the lack of
postholes and the large size and unprepared nature of the hearth indicate that it

Fields et al. -- The Peerless Bottoms Site

107

was not inside a house. The possible association of Features 5, 6, and 8 with a
structure such as a brush arbor is especially intriguing because Feature 8 appears
to represent a burned stump rather than a post or stake (based on its identification
as an oak root and the early radiocarbon assay). If both of these interpretations
are correct, Feature 8 must represent a burned tree that was still standing and
opportunistically used as a support post at the time 41HP175 was occupied.
While this seems far-fetched given the substantially greater age of the Feature 8
radiocarbon assay compared to most of those from the site, the distributional
patterns seem too consistent to be mere coincidence.
Interpreting the other distributional patterns within the block is somewhat
more difficult because of the problems of relating behavior to specific classes of
remains. Nonetheless, two suggestions are offered here. First, the concentrations
of cores, manufacture-broken tools, burned rocks, ceramics, and faunal remains
in the north part of the block may represent the intentional discard of bulky
debris, including the by-products of butchering, along the edge of and perhaps
even into the abandoned creek channel. While the channel was not exposed in
this part of the site, the cross section in the eastern end of the trackhoe trench
revealed that it does contain cultural materials, and this lends support to the
conclusion that this part of the site was used for trash disposal. Second, the
concentrations of manufacture-broken tools, complete tools, use-broken tools,
expedient tools, burned rocks, faunal remains, nutshells, ground/pitted stones,
and ceramics west of the hearth may represent the use of this area for a variety of
processing and maintenance activities, as welt as discard. Probably the most
significant aspects about this part of the site, both of which point to a complex
history of use, are the occurrence of high densities of so many classes of materials, excluding debitage, and their variable distributions between the edge of
Feature 1 and the west edge of the block.
Based on the features and the distributional evidence, the excavation block
appears to have sampled an outside activity area that was used intensively but for
a limited span of time. It is for this reason that the lengthy occupational history
implied by some of the absolute chronometric data is questioned. Judging from
the abundance of cultural materials, especially the large number of ceramic
vessels and the wide range of vessel forms (see Figure 13), and the presence of
cultigens, it is surmised that the site was occupied on a permanent basis and that
this outside activity area was associated with a house. No evidence for a house
was found in the block, in the Gradall units around the block, or in the isolated 1x-l-m units, but it is speculated that the house structure may be represented by
the concentration of materials in the northwest corner of the core area.
Certainly, the distributions of the ceramic vessels tie these two areas together, and contemporaneity is suggested by the radiocarbon dates. If a house
was located in the part of the site opposite the discard zone circling the hearth
on the east and south, the house was separated from this outside activity area by
a ca. 10 m wide expanse where relatively few artifacts were deposited and thus
where artifact-producing activities were performed infrequently. Unfortunately,

108

Texas Archeological Society

too little work was done in the northwestern concentration to interpret it with
confidence.
As noted above, the abundance of ceramic vessels (>54) and the range of
vessel and non-vessel forms (i.e., numerous jar and bowl forms of various sizes,
a few bottles, and a few pipes) are interpreted as reflecting broad ranges of
activities. The assemblage of chipped stones also seems to indicate a broad range
of procurement, processing, manufacture, and maintenance activities. The tools
and cores are dominated by arrow points (17 percent), bifaces (15 percent),
expedient unifaces/edge fragments (10 percent), and modified flakes (10 percent), while arrow point preforms (6 percent), gouges (4 percent), and shaped
unifaces (4 percent) occur in moderate percentages. The significantly higher
frequency of shaped unifaces at this site compared to others at Cooper Lake
suggests a greater emphasis on hide processing at 41HP175, but there is no
evidence in the faunal remains to indicate that this was associated with increased
use of bison (see below). Dart points (1 percent) and dart point preforms (<1
percent) are quite scarce, indicating that the dart and atlatl had been replaced by
the bow and arrow by the early part of the Late Caddoan period. Otherwise, the
tools that are least frequent (cobble tools, 1 percent) or absent (perforators and
burins) at 41HP175 are the same forms that tend to be infrequent at other sites in
the project area. Compared to other sites at Cooper Lake, ground/pecked/battered
stones are relatively common at 41HP175, but unlike at the other sites, hammerstones and pitted stones are more frequent than grinding stones. This may reflect
the increased use of wooden mortars for processing plant foods during the Late
Caddoan period, or it could be due to a greater emphasis on the processing of
hardwood nuts and perhaps core reduction at 41HP175.
The latter is supported by the fact that cores constitute 31 percent of the
non-debitage lithic collection, and it appears that core reduction to produce
expedient flake tools and flake blanks for arrow point manufacture was an important strategy. Intensive core reduction probably explains the relatively small
size of the cores from 41HP175 (mean length = 13.7 + 4.4 mm; mean width =
9.7 + 3.6 mm; mean thickness = 6.0 + 2.5 mm), and this, along with the importance of tool manufacture overall, may explain the high ratio of unmodified
debitage to chipped stone tools (27.7:1). This site stands out in terms of lithic
technology from other sites in the area also in that it has a high percentage of
chips (69 percent) and low percentages of complete flakes (17 percent) and
proximal fragments (14 percent), a high percentage of flakes less than 21 mm in
maximum dimension (76 percent), and a high percentage of flakes with corticate
platforms (24 percent), all of which may be related to a focus on unpatterned
core reduction.
In terms of lithic raw material usage, 41HP175 is conspicuous for its very
high percentages of fine-grained quartzite among the shaped tools (74 percent),
modified flakes/expedient unifaces (76 percent), and unmodified debitage (76
percent). Non-quartzite fine-grained materials are even more scarce than at other
sites at Cooper Lake, constituting just 2 percent of the shaped tools, 2 percent of

Fields et al. -- The Peerless Bottoms Site

109

the expedient tools, 1 percent of the cores, and less than 1 percent of the
unmodified debitage. No artifacts of chalcedony were recovered, and there are
only a few pieces of debitage of novaculite. The higher percentages of these
materials in the tools than in the debitage suggest that most of the tools of chert
were manufactured elsewhere and saw limited further reduction or resharpening
at 41HP175. A strong focus on local lithic sources is further indicated by the
extreme infrequency of artifacts made of materials non-local to the region, with
just one shaped tool (source unknown), one modified flake/expedient uniface
(Red River gravels), and two pieces of unmodified debitage (Red River gravels)
being classified as non-local.
The collection of faunal remains is of limited interpretive value because of
its small size and poor state of preservation, which probably account for the
limited variety of taxa present and the lack of invertebrate remains. Nonetheless,
it does provide some insights into subsistence practices. The identified vertebrate
remains point to a focus on white-tailed deer (66 percent of the identified
elements are deer or deer/pronghorn) and turtles (24 percent), and in this respect,
Late Caddoan hunting strategies appear to have been quite similar to Woodland
and Early Caddoan ones in the upper Sulphur River valley. While pronghorn and
bison are present, they are not sufficiently frequent to indicate grasslands-oriented hunting strategies as has been proposed for the Late Caddoan period in
parts of the western Caddoan area (Perttula 1990:Part I, 112-122).
Modified bones are not frequent, especially considering that half of the
sample may represent parts of a single item. Nonetheless, the recovery of six
functionally distinct kinds of artifacts-a musical rasp (?), worked antlers, awls,
a beamer, a pin, and turtle shells with scrape marks-points to a diverse bone
tool assemblage.
Macrobotanical remains are moderately abundant, although most of the
wood charcoal is from Feature 8 and probably is not cultural. The economic
remains identified in the analyzed sample consist predominantly of hickory
nutshells, with pecan nutshells, black walnut nutshells, acorns, honey locust
seeds, water locust seeds, maize, squash, hackberry seeds, and Pediomelum
(formerly Psoralea) root or cortex fragments being present in much smaller
quantities. These data suggest primary reliance on wild plant foods (e.g., hardwood nuts, fruits, seeds, and tubers) during the Late Caddoan period, with
limited use of cultigens. The wood charcoal is relatively heavily dominated by
oak, and this may indicate selectivity of fuel use.
Fire-cracked rocks are moderately abundant at 4tHP175, but the relatively
low ratio (5.7:1) of burned rock weight to number of chipped stone tools (multiplied by 100) indicates that processing activities using these rocks were much
less important than they were at earlier sites in the project area. The low number
of burned rocks per kilogram (68) implies relatively infrequent reuse of rocks,
and this could reflect the limited number of occupational episodes. Burned clay
and burned clay with impressions are not very abundant in spite of the presence
of the large hearth, and this also could be a reflection of the limited occupation

110

Texas Archeological Society

span. In contrast, burned mud dauber nests are relatively common, and they may
indicate the presence of a structure.
In sum, 41HP175 is interpreted as a small hamlet that was occupied on a
permanent, or at least multiseasonal, basis by hunter-gatherers engaged in limited horticulture for a brief interval during the early part of the Late Caddoan
period. The argument for a limited span of occupation, which is not particularly
well supported by the absolute chronometric data, hinges on four main lines of
evidence. First, the site is too limited in size to represent a large number of
overlapping occupations, and it is implausible to suppose that repeated use episodes over a long span would have centered in the same place (i.e., Feature 1).
Second, the ceramic sherds tend to be large and can be placed into batches representing reconstructable vessel sections, the distributions of which are more
suggestive of the transportation of parts of broken vessels for discard or reuse
than in situ pot breakage and dispersal by foot traffic. Third, the artifacts and
other cultural materials exhibit highly patterned distributions within the excavation block suggestive of a hearth-centered activity area, and it is unlikely that
such patterning would have survived a large number of occupations. And fourth,
the temporally sensitive artifacts are most consistent with occupations dating to
the Late Caddoan period.
While the predominance of two distinct arrow point styles (i.e., Turney and
Perdiz) could be used to argue for use over a fair length of time, the power of
such an argument is diminished by the fact that a number of the graves at the
Tuck Carpenter site in Camp County contained both triangular arrow points
(typed as Talco and Maud) and contracting-stem points (typed as Perdiz and
Bassett), implying contemporaneous usage of these distinctly different styles
(Turner 1978:62). Further, Perttula’ s (1992:243-249) recent seriation of the burials from the Tuck Carpenter site and 11 other Titus phase cemeteries using arrow
point types and Ripley Engraved decorative motifs indicates partly contemporaneous usage of stemmed (Bassett) and triangular (Maud) points.
The similarities in the arrow point assemblages from 41HP175 and the Tuck
Carpenter site suggest some relationship between 41HP175 and the Titus phase
sites found mostly in the Cypress Creek valley. This similarity extends only partly
to the ceramics, however. While some of the bowls with scroll motifs, some of
the punctated and appliqurd jars, and the engraved bottles are reminiscent of
such Titus phase types as Ripley Engraved, McKinney Plain, and Taylor or
Wilder Engraved, the 41HP175 assemblage overall, with its low incidence of
brushing, high frequency of shell tempering, and prominent presence of Avery
Engraved, is quite different from the Titus phase assemblages characterized by
Thurmond (1990:228).
Closer similarities can be found with the burial assemblages illustrated for
the Roitsch-Williams-Roden site complex on the Red River, where Avery Engraved deep bowls, bowls typed as Simms Engraved and less frequently as
Ripley Engraved, and punctated and appliqurd utility jars typed as Nash NeckBanded, McKinney Plain, and Emory Punctated-Incised are common (Perino

Fields et al. -- The Peerless Bottoms Site

111

1981, 1983; Skinner et al. 1969). The ceramics from 41HP175 are different from
these Red River collections in some notable ways, though, especially the lack of
Avery Engraved vessels other than deep bowls, the predominance of bowl forms
and slanted scroll motifs that are more typical of Ripley Engraved than Simms
Engraved, and the presence of a few globular jars (especially Vessel 47) that are
more reminiscent of Plains vessel forms than those found on the Red River.
Also, the moderate percentage of shell tempering (41 percent of the sherds
and 20 percent of the vessels) at 41HP175 is at odds with the very low incidence
of shell tempering (2 percent) indicated for the vessels from the burials at the
Roden site (Perino 1981:47-54). Given the apparent predominance of shell
tempering in the 1968 collection from the Roitsch site (Skinner et al. 1969:3943), however, it is tempting to speculate that Perino’s (1981:47-54) identification
of bone as the primary tempering agent in the Roden site ceramics refers instead
to shell. In fact, the nearly exclusive use of shell temper among the types
represented in the 1968 vessel collection from the Roitsch site (i.e., Avery
Engraved, Simms Engraved, Hudson Engraved, Keno Trailed, Nash NeckBanded, and Emory Punctated-Incised) appears to contrast with the situation at
41HP175 where shell temper occurs primarily in a few utility jar forms and a
few undecorated bowls. The significance of this difference remains unclear,
however, since grog tempering is well represented in the sherd (as opposed to
the vessel) collection from the 1968 work at the Roitsch site (Skinner et al.
1969:47-51, 64-67).
In any case, part of the ceramic assemblage from 41HP175 forms a subset
of the collections from these Red River sites in terms of vessel forms and
decorations, if not in terms of temper type percentages, while part (i.e., most of
the carinated and simple bowls) is more typical of assemblages found in the
Cypress Creek valley. Thus, the ceramics point to some connections with both
the McCurtain phase and the Titus phase, while, as noted above, the presence of
Perdiz points at 41HP175 hints at stronger connections with groups in the
Cypress Creek valley than on the Red River.
Complicating the issue of phase affiliations is the scarcity of non-local lithic
raw materials at 41HP175, which suggests extreme provincialism for the inhabitants of the site. Based on these data, it appears that the site was occupied by
groups who had limited mobility outside of the Cooper Lake area into regions
with higher quality lithic materials (e.g., the Red River) and/or limited interaction with groups occupying these regions. From this perspective, it appears that
41HP175 may represent an occupation by an indigenous group rather than a
group intrusive from elsewhere.
