THE McCARTER SITE, A LATE ARCHAIC
OCCUPATION AT MUSKOGEE,
OKLAHOMA
By JAMES B. SHAEFFER

During October, 1956, Mr. and Mrs. Knowles Montgomery of
Muskogee, Oklahoma, brought to the attention of Prof. Robert
E. Bell and the writer the fact that impending industrial construction on the outskirts of Muskogee would shortly destroy
some sites well known to collectors. As a result the site was
visited and negotiations begun with Callery Chemical Co. and
the Department of the Navy for permission to excavate. By
February a right of entry permit was secured and at the same
time funds were made available by the National Park Service
for the salvage operation.
Appreciation is expressed to the institutions and agencies
mentioned above for their co-operation which made this work
possible, and to the individuals involved, especially Dr. John
M. Corbett, Dr. Erik K. Reed, and Mr. Charlie R. Steen of the
National Park Service, Lt. Cmdr. L. W. Graves, U. S. N., Mr.
R. G. Schmidt of the Callery Chemical Co., as well as to Mr.
and Mrs. Montgomery for their hospitality and interest.
LOCATION
About six miles west of Muskogee, U. S. Highway 62 crosses
the Arkansas River. For several miles north and south of this
highway bridge there is almost continuous surface evidence of
prehistoric occupation along the west bank of the river. Because
of the sporadic occurrence of sherds it was thought that this
area might represent outlying villages of the Hughes Mound
and other mounds located just north of Muskogee on the Arkansas and Grand rivers, and it was with this thought in mind that
the excavations reported here were begun. It now appears that
the greater part of the evidence represents an earlier pre-pottery group and that the occupation of the ceramic horizon was
more scattered and superficial, at least along this section of the
Arkansas River.

The McCarter Site, ~ Late Archaic Occupation

241

The area of this Archaic or pre-pottery occupation, though
rather extensive on its north-south axis along the river, does
not extend back from the bank much over fifty yards. This is
due in great part to a shift in the course of the Arkansas River
against its high western bank. This change has undermined the
bank and swept away the greater part of many of the sites. It
might be added that prehistorically as now the western bank
was well above water, being at present probably a hundred feet
above the stream, while the even higher eastern bank is four
to eight miles away, being formed by a series of low hills. Between these two banks is a wide flat first terrace cut by the
present and former channels of the Arkansas which has shifted
intermittently within these broad confines. The exact channel
of the river at the time of the Archaic occupancy is problematical. At present the sites command a major bend of the river
to the south and prehistorically might have been situated on a
point commanding both the northern and southern approaches
of the river for a distance of several miles.
THE SITES
The four areas with which this report is concerned actually
present an almost continuous area of occupation beginning
about a mile south of the highway bridge to which reference
has been made. The area under excavation was separated into
two sites (sites Ms15 and Ms16) based upon the presence
of Indian pottery as well as pioneer pottery and crockery in
the northern two thirds, and their absence in the southern
third. Subsequent excavation substantiated this original division
but established further that the lithic culture extended over
the entire area while the ceramic horizons were only superficially present in the northern section.
EXCAVATION
The writer began excavation on February 16 and worked
until the Navy construction deadline of March 7. Excavation
was hampered by poor weather throughout this period and a
number of days of digging were lost because of combinations
of fog, wind, rain and cold. The writer was assisted in the excavation by Mr. A. L. Roberts who worked throughout the

z~

period and by Mr. Ira Williams who dug during the final
week. Volunteer assistance was given by Mr. Albert Gorman
who is responsible for the finding and excavation of a charcoal
log from Area A which has been accepted by the Humble Oil
and Refining Company for radiocarbon dating.
FIELD PROCEDURES
After reconnaissance, five areas were chosen for testing
(Fig. 59). These, designated as Areas A, B, C, D, and E, were
staked off into 50 foot blocks. Work was begun at the north end
of the site in Area A. Here two trenches five feet wide
were begun at one corner and extended at right angles to each
other for twenty feet. Two additional trenches at right angles
enclosed a square. This preliminary trenching established the
stratigraphy, the general paucity of the ceramic horizon and
the source of the scattered stone which had been found previously on the surface of the site. This stone was found to be
concentrated just above a sarid layer overlying the native red
clay and just below the dark occupational debris underneath
the surface. However, the stone layer at this location was
about two and a half feet below the surface and it was soon
realized that it would be more profitable because of the limitations of time and money to find a shallower area so that a
larger area could be uncovered. Work was therefore shifted to
Area E at the opposite end of the site. Here Houses A and B
were uncovered within an excavated area 22 x 30 feet under
an average overburden of 15 to 18 inches. The major excavation
effort was made here to establish the living area and the house
type, and it was from this area that the majority of artifacts
came. Upon the excavation of the house units, Area E was
tested by means of five foot square test pits carried down to
native soil, as indicated on the area plan (Fig. 59). Area D
was then briefly tested, only one pit showing evidence of the
rocks which had come to be associated with the living area.
Finally, a test in Area C disclosed House C which was entirely
excavated by the writer while the other workers returned to
Areas A and B for final testing to determine if possible the
location of the ceramic occupation and the extent of the Archaic
village.

STRATIGRAPHY
It was found that the entire site had identical stratigraphy,
varying only in the relative thickness of the four characteristic strata (Figs. 60, 61). The upper stratum, 5 to 8 inches
thick, was a light brown soil disturbed by cultivation over all
areas except E which was in pasture. Below this cultivated
stratum was the dark soil of occupational debris containing
charcoal flakes, flint chips, and occasional sherds in Area A, and
pioneer glass, metal, and crockery in Area C. Below this zone
were occasional concentrations of small sandstone rocks which
were for the most part flat, irregular in shape, from one to two
inches in thickness, and five to eight inches at their greatest
measurement. This rock layer, or in its absence the occupational debris, rested on a yellowish sand 4 to 8 inches in depth.
This sand was compacted and discolored on top, becoming more
sandy and yellowish as it reached the native clay beneath. The
latter upon exposure was yellow-orange but gradually darkened
to a distinct red. It might be added that this change upon exposure applied as well to the top of the yellow soil. Troweling
often revealed post and rodent holes which, after an hour or
less, darkened and disappeared until retroweled.
In general the test pits showed that while the native clay
sloped slightly toward the west and away from the river, the
black overburden was considerably higher along the river bank.
Seventy-five yards from the river bank the occupational debris
was two to three inches thick or less, indicating a considerable
spreading out of the occupational debris from a higher area of
occupation which has since disappeared into the river.
WHITE OCCUPATION
An old cistern represented by a tree-rimmed depression in
the ground was located in Area C. It was here that the so-called
pioneer culture was concentrated. During the test pitting 13
pieces of china and crockery, 4 pieces of glass, and 9 pieces of
metal were recovered. This material probably dates from the
end of the 19th or beginning of the 20th century.

In addition one clay marble was recovered within five inches
of the surface in Area D. One sherd of an 18th to 19th century
clay trade pipe was found on the surface of Area A.
HOUSES A AND B, AREA E
During the initial excavation at Area A it soon became apparent that the numerous stones encountered were localized
in a thin layer between the sand stratum and the overlying
charcoal flecked black soil above. In Area E it was therefore
decided to attempt to excavate a sufficiently large area to determine whether or not there was a pattern in the distribution
of these sandstone fragments or whether they extended as a
carpet over the entire site (Figs. 60; 62, B, C, D). It had been
surmised at first that these stones on the surface represented
the remains of hearths but excavation during the initial period
seemed to indicate that the great majority of them were flat
stones in a horizontal position, which seemed unusual for
scattered hearth material. A rock concentration 30 x 21 feet in
Area E was isolated on three sides and apparently continued to
the north. Since all artifacts recovered were either just above,
just below, or in these rock concentrations, it was felt that
the rocks represented a general habitation area and level and
that they had served to outline hearths, to flag work areas, to
reinforce soft spots in floors, and to serve as underpinning for
auxiliary roof supports. A circular structure made of boulder
type rocks found in this area appeared to be the hearth despite
the absence of ash. The separation of the general rock area into
two house units was based upon the dearth of stone between
the areas. Whether this represents the true state of affairs or
whether the whole area was part of a much larger structure
could not be determined because of time limitations. However,
the nature of the habitation was established to the extent that
it can be said to have been a pole structure with possibly some
sort of extended entryway, floored with irregular flagged areas
and probably containing a hearth. The irregular post pattern
represents the molds of the major supports which were revealed at clay level and it is entirely possible that all poles did
not penetrate to this same depth.
While the results of this effort to establish a house type were

The McCarter Site, a Late Archaic Occ~pation

249

disappointing, it can be attributed in part to the facts that no
Archaic house type as yet has been reported in Oklahoma and
that the flagging was rather indefinite. In conferring with
Robert Bell on this point it was learned that several years ago
a large irregular flagged area was found under a low mound at
the Harlan site in east central Oklahoma. The report on this
work is in preparation. The flagging in this case, while not coyering the entire floor of the rectangular structure of which it
was a part, was nevertheless quite definite. It apparently was
made of larger stones, and the structure itself was large enough
(40 x 60 feet) to be considered of ceremonial or communal
nature. The Harlan site is part of the early ceramic Gibson
Aspect and is dated circa 600 A. D.
The only other reference to flagging which has been located
in the literature of the immediate area is the description by
Cyrus Ray (1934, p. 197) of a rock pavement covering an area
27 x 25 feet on a mesa near Abilene, Texas. This flagging, exposed at ground level, differed from the McCarter and Harlan examples in being a definite rectangle and about a foot thick. Approximately a foot and a half below it was a somewhat similar
pavement made of flat stone only one layer in thickness. No
artifacts or other associated materials were reported other
than an extended burial two feet below the lower stone layer.
The burial was thought to be associated with the Clear Fork
Complex of the Edwards Plateau Archaic.
The occurrences cited perhaps suggest that flagging as a
house building trait begins in the late archaic period and persists into the early ceramic horizon. It is possible that the
irregular and rather fragmental remains at the McCarter and
Harlan sites may represent the results of "robbing" for structural material for later houses while the Abilene example represents a complete and later form.
HOUSE C, AREA C
The outline of the house posts surrounding the flagged area
was obtained by troweling off the top of the sand stratum
just below the rock level (Figs. 61; 62, A). The discoloration
of some, but not all, of the post molds continued to the native

soil. The unit here, of course, represents a small house with the
same general construction as Houses A and B but having more
flagging in proportion to the floor space. While in Houses A
and B the relation of the hearths to the interior walls is not
too definite, the fireplace in House C is definitely within the
walls. It might be noted here that the three house areas are contemporaneous, judging by the presence of Plainview-like points
on the floors of Houses B and C and the presence of Gary-like
points in all three house areas.
The house in this case is quite small compared with houses
reported for the Fort Coffee, Spiro, McCurtain, and Bryan
Foci. The only rectangular house of comparable size (10 x 12
feet) in the literature appears to be one from the Sanders Focus
in northeast Texas, a late ceramic focus of the Gibson Aspect.
This Sanders house does not provide a satisfactory comparison
with House C at McCarter. It might be noted that in general,
the rectangular house plan is characteristic of eastern Oklahoma during the Gibson Aspect while the circular and oval
houses are found in northeastern Texas (Bell and Baerreis,
1951, p. 60). It is only in the later Fulton Aspect, in the Fort
Coffee Focus and in the McCurtain Focus, that the circular
house appears occasionally in Oklahoma, while in the northeast
Texas area the rectangular house appears in the Sanders focus
of the late Gibson Aspect (Suhm et al., 1954, p. 178). In the
case of the iKcCarter site this suggests northern rather than
southern basic affiliations for House C during the late Archaic.
PITS
This site was characterized by a lack of deep pits. None were
found during the rather extensive test pitting of the area.
Whatever cache pits existed must have been shallow depressions
between the sand layer and the native clay, a depth of usually
less than a foot. One such stone-rimmed pit occurred beside
the fireplace in House C. Absence of cache pits is a negative
characteristic shared with the Archaic culture of northeastern
Oklahoma (Baerreis, 1951).

The McCarter Site, ~ Late Archaic Occz~patio.~

253

REFUSE
Characteristic, likewise, was the general absence of animal
bone and shell refuse scattered in the fill. A few shells were
noted in Area C on the surface but none were encountered in
excavation. Stone chips were lacking in the shallower parts
of the site except in proximity to stone concentrations (i. e.

habitation areas). There were exceptions, of course, where
ploughing had occurred.
HEARTHS
Hearths were distinguished from other structural concentrations of stone by the use of river boulders as opposed to the
fiat horizontal stones. Three such areas were encountered and
are designated as hearths in the site plans (Figs. 60, 61).
Charcoal concentrations were found in one location in Area A.
It is believed that all three occurrences are contemporaneous,
representing the roof timbers from one structure.
ARTIFACT TYPOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION
Descriptive and distributional data on the artifacts from
the McCarter site are presented in the table and Appendix,
pp. 261-266.
DISCUSSION
Economy
The Table of Artifact Distribution by Areas (p. 261) raises
some questions concerning the type of economy followed at
the McCarter site. The data from this single site are insufficient
to answer these questions definitely. However, it is apparent, if
Area E is assumed to represent an earlier phase than Area A,
that there was a shift of emphasis in the economy during occupancy of the site.
If Area E, which lacked evidence of pottery and small points,
is taken to represent an earlier phase, the outstanding fact in
comparing it with Area A is the relatively numerous fragments
of handstones found in Area E and the dearth of them in Area
A. It should be emphasized that the handstones in Area E are
not, for the most part, well formed. In fact the abraded stone
complex is so amorphous in shape as to suggest something in
its beginning. This is especially true if these handstones are
compared with those of the later phases of the Grove Focus.
The lack of defined grinding planes and the depressions found
on some of the surfaces suggest pounding and crushing operations connected with the preparation of roots, fruits, nuts, and
seeds rather than the true milling of cultivated grains.

The McCarter Site, a Late Archaic Occzqgation

255

In chipped stone likewise, Area E yields tool types which are
not found or which occur infrequently in Area A, notably the
flint blades, planes and choppers. Quite probably these had more
to do with the preparation of plant foods and with skin preparation, since the occurrence of points in both areas is roughly the
same although the types differ. The small points correlate with
the pottery bearing areas. There is nothing significant in this
distribution except that it suggests a continuity in the hunting
aspect together with a change in the gathering aspect, which
was presumably increasingly supplemented by agricultural
products, although this particular excavation does not establish
this interpretation.
In summary, it would appear from the rudimentary nature of
the sandstone tool complex found in Area E, especially the
handstones and slabs for grinding seeds, that they had been
added to a well-established flint-working complex. The presence
of the choppers, planes and blades which are fairly well made
and not too advanced technically from the finish of the flint
points suggests that a gathering-hunting economy had been
established for some time. The sandstone abraders may, on the
other hand, represent an increment due to gradual climatic
changes affecting the environment generally or subsequent
direct or indirect contact with groups having a developed grinding complex.
COMPARISONS
Grove Focus of Northeastern Oklahoma
There are some general similarities between the McCarter
site and those of the Grove Focus (Baerreis, 1951; Hall, 1954).
Among the more obvious are absence of cache pits and bone
and shell fragments together with the occurrence of large and
small flint scrapers, grinding stones, choppers and certain types
of points in both areas. Both are open sites of fairly large size.
Differences are seen for the most part in a number of traits
which are present in the north and lacking or infrequent at
the McCarter site, such as axes, drills, mortars and large numbers of scrapers. Conversely, traits not present in the Grove
Focus but present at Muskogee are high backed pebble planes,
large choppers or hand axes and spuds as well as definite
differences in the major types of projectile points.

Texas Archeological Society

256

The greatest correlation between the two areas is to be found
in the general technological similarity of form in the chipped
stone industry. However, even here the two industries are distinguishable on the basis of material, the Grove Focus material being lighter in color because of association with limestone deposits while the Muskogee material is darker chert
with more sheen, known generically as Boone chert. Further
distinction in finish can be detected in the large patinated surfaces which are retained on the Muskogee flint material as
opposed to the almost total removal of patinated surfaces on
the Delaware specimens.
The greatest differences between the industries of the two
areas lie in (1) the frequency of projectile points in comparison
to the other types of artifacts, (2) different dominance of
projectile point types, and (3) the relative numbers of scrapers,
grinding stones, knives and projectile points. Projectile points
outnumber all other classes of artifacts in the Grove Focus.
This situation is not found at the McCarter site. Of the 14
major projectile point types listed for the Grove Focus only four
were recovered in situ at the McCarter site though other types
have been found on the surface by collectors. In the table below
these four types are listed in order of frequency and compared
with the frequency table for the Grove sites:

As a further correlation of the chipped stone work between
the two areas a comparison can be made with the classes of
artifacts on which Baerreis based his temporal differentiation
of the Grove material into the three phases A, B, and C. Of
these six classes only four are present in the McCarter material
and are listed as follows:

From the tables of relative frequency listed above it is apparent that the McCarter chipped stone falls in temporal position either between Grove Phases B and C or at the beginning
of Phase C.
Fourche Maline Focus
Superficially there appear to be resemblances in form between the illustrated material from the Scott site (Bell, 1953,
Fig. 98) and that from the McCarter site. Examination of the
specimens, however, shows that they differ in proportions, size,
and thickness as well as material. For instance, while the Gary
type point predominates in both areas, the Fourche Maline type
is for the most part of a dark quartzite and in size is smaller,
slenderer, and thinner. This typical and distinctive quartzite
material is absent from the McCarter site, even in the form
of chips. At the same time, the characteristic flint from the
McCarter site, Boone chert, is recognizable in fragments from
the Dlev site in the Grove Focus material.
This combination of generalized typological resemblance with
some small correspondence in secondary material (notably a
few fragments of the black flint at the McCarter site which is
also found at the Scott site) suggests a cultural relationship,
not contemporaneity. Considering that the Fourche Maline
River is but 60 miles away, some intrusive material and closer
typological resemblances would be expected if the Fourche
Maline Focus were contemporaneous with the McCarter site.
The fact that this is not so and that the McCarter material
is present to some extent in Delaware County suggests that
Fourche Maline is later. This assumption would seem to be
strengthened by the fact that the chipped stone work decreases
in size, as noted above, a characteristic trend of technological
maturity in stone work.

258

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

On the other hand, contemporaneity with Fourche Maline is
expressed by the presence of a few Williams Plain pottery
sherds, Williams Plain being the typical pottery of the upper
levels of that focus. It could be that (1) these sherds are intrusive, being derived from a part of the site which has washed
into the river; (2) the sample at the McCarter site was insufficient to reveal basic correlations in stonework with the Fourche
Maline focus; (3) the Williams Plain designation includes
plainwares derived from more than one source or tradition;
(4) Williams Plain was derived from an unidentified source
other than Fourche Maline; or (5) the Williams Plain type of
east central Oklahoma was derived from the Early Woodland
types of northeastern Oklahoma which as it diffused southward became more abundant and developed a smoother finish.
In this last regard, the finish of the McCarter site Williams
Plain sherds is not as smooth under magnification as that on
specimens from the Scott site and is intermediate between the
former and the sandy surfaces of the Woodland types.
At any rate there appears to be a contradiction which awaits
clarification in the presence of Williams Plain, so typical of the
Fourche Maline Focus, and the total absence of quartzite which
is the equally typical stone material of the Fourche Maline
chipped stone industry. In fact, so different are the general
characteristics of the sites in the almost complete absence of
bone and shell at the McCarter site and their abundance on the
Fourche h{aline sites that, except for the anamoly of the sherds,
either a later time level for Fourche Maline or more numerous
signs of culture contact in other traits and activities could be
expected. It is therefore likely that the Williams Plain sherds
were not contemporaneous with the excavated portions of the
site.
The Webber Falls-Arkansas Slate Industry
Several traits, the spud or digging tool and the rectangular
hoe, are made of an argillaceous slate, and neither the material nor the tools appear to be derived from any of the sources
discussed. The U. S. Geological Survey has stated that the only
local outcroppings of this material are to be found in eastern
Arkansas and near Webber Falls, Oklahoma, about 20 miles
southeast of the McCarter site (personal communication from

The McCarter Site, ~ Late Archaic Occ~pation

259

Mr. Cecil Cleavenger, Fort Smith, Arkansas). Northeast of
Fort Smith in Arkansas there is a group of sites which appear
to equate roughly with the Fourche Maline sites in the abundance of shell and bone debris, the number of sandstone fragments and the scattering of grit tempered pottery. The slate
tools, however, differ typologically in being rather large, coarse,
and somewhat thick, the characteristic form being a bulbous
digging tool with a narrow half reminiscent in outline of the
McCarter spud. It is, however, considerably smaller and not
as well defined or carefully worked. No close relationship with
either of these areas is recognized. Again, as in the case of the
pottery, the slate tools at the McCarter site may represent a
late, indirect or intermittent contact.
Middle Archaic Survival
A further orientation of some of the material from the McCarter site appears to be toward the south and possibly to the
west. The striking aspect of the stone industry at the McCarter
site, when compared with material from the Grove Focus, is
the large proportion and higher percentage of crust remaining
on the flint tools. This is especially noticeable in the category
designated as planes. These are simply flint river boulders of
fist size with an end knocked off and secondarily chipped on one
side of the steeper end. The complex suggests a pebble industry
rather than a true core industry. While no exact similarities
have been noted in the literature, the nearest parallel is to be
seen in the gouge-planer of the Edwards Plateau (Kelley, 1947)
and Trinity (Crook and Harris, 1952) Aspects of the Balcones
Phase of north and north-central Texas. There also seem to
be generic similarities with the Cochise planes from the southeastern part of Arizona (Sayles and Antevs, 1941).
In Oklahoma on the basis of an initial surface survey (Lawton, 1957) and a preliminary study (Shaeffer, 1956) this type
of tool has been noted as part of a crude quartzite pebble or
core industry apparently centering in central Oklahoma. The
Muskogee planes differ from the central Oklahoma types in material and in having more definite form. Presumably, if derived
from this source, they are more advanced and later than their
prototypes to the west and south.

260

Texas A~âcheological Society

CONCLUSIONS
The McCarter site appears to be basically a peripheral manifestation of the Grove Focus of northeastern Oklahoma, equating with its Phases B and C. It differs in the greater emphasis
on gathering activities as evidenced by the greater occurrence
of handstones, choppers and planes, the source of which is believed to be a middle Archaic level of culture diffusing from the
area to the southwest. The lesser emphasis on hunting was possibly a local adjustment to a new and/or changing environment.

APPENDIX: ARTIFACT TYPOLOGY
For location and number of specimens, see Table, p. 261.
Bone
Unidentifiable fragments only.
Pottery
Type A:

Williams Plain as described;
marks.

one sherd shows wiping

Type B:

Woodward Plain, Leached Variant, surface color orange
with no core discoloration; uniform oxidation; surface
soft and powdery; fracture crumbly; surface--angular
leaching pits under magnification; probably shell-tempered and subjected to very hot fire; fine sandy clay,
surface smoothed but not polished. Undoubtedly, a late
intrusive. Not associated with culture reported here.
Stone, Abraded

Handstones
Type A:

Natural river boulders, round to squarish with some
flat planes showing rubbing; surfaces and edges pitted,
some specimens show definite pitting;, soft, light to
very heavy homogeneous sandstone.

Type B:

Sandstone river boulder shaped at end to squarish form;
top and bottom lightly rounded and worn smooth; considerable pecking and pitting on all edges; deep
scratches on flat surfaces; a heavy stone probably used
as a hammer, crusher, grinder and pestle.

Milling Stone

A block of unfinished, hard sandstone of stratum thickness, one end slightly thicker than the other forming a
slight slope; natural surface irregularity. One side
shows pronounced flattening and wear of higher surfaces surrounding depressed areas; the other side shows
slight flattening. Wear confined to upper half of block.
Worn area contains minute holes and scratches as if
something sharp had been crushed or pulverized on surface.

Palette, Proto(?) Fragments of flat sandstone river rocks too thin for
handstones; some of the surfaces looked stained.
Stone, Chipped
Blades

Choppers
Type A:

Percussion chipping of river pebbles; biracial; in several
cases all traces of exterior patination removed; three
general shapes--elongated, leaf, and discoidal; considerable variety of flint used; possibly a later introduction
from a more advanced technological tradition as evidenced by all-over, bifacial chipping and material variation.
Wedge shape; thick side for grip tapering to half-moon
shaped cutting edge; House B material--black slate;

The McCarter Site, a Late Archaic Occupation

265

Area A specimen of soft sandstone with edge rounded;
some red stain on surface; both formed by rough, unifacial, percussion flaking.
Type B :

Flat, natural, river rock; formed as above but larger
and thinner; material--hard limestone.

Disk (Knife)

Thin circular shape, flat across top; appears to be
shaped from standstone stratum; use unknown but
repetition of shape in three specimens suggests specific
tool function.

Hoe

Rectangular fragment of thin, porous slate; chipped on
three edges; high area on both surfaces worked to
smooth finish; slate badly pitted by erosion of natural
inclusions.

Points
Type A:

Area D specimen side notched with straight base chipped
along sides and over point only; both sides of central
area unworked; shoulder almost straight, one being
more prominent than the other; material--white flint;
general effect crude or careless work. Area B specimen
same general form as above but larger stem, square
base and slightly contracting stem; side notches eliminated; biracial secondary chipping on sides and across
point on both faces; material--yellow-grey flint.

Type B:

Area A specimen is base fragment; secondary chipping
on edges and on all surfaces; secondary chipping is
irregular as though straightened by. rubbing rather than
pressure. Area D whole specimen is a flake; stemless;
flaring at shoulders; secondary chipping on edges and
over point; little chipping on central areas; material-dark grey flint, not Boone chert.

Type C:

Diagonal transverse percussion flaking with slightly serrated edge; in form it is an elongated triangle with
concave base; surface chipped all over; material--pinkish white flint.

Type D:

Fishtail shape; the side is notched into straight shoulder
and the stem has parallel sides, base deeply concave;
transverse diagonal flaking; no secondary pressure flaking; material--Area A light grey flint with small inclusions, Area C light pink and white; both show poor
fracture.

Type E:

Triangular shape, straight base; side notched above
straight-sided base; triangular part above stem; primary flaking on one side of flake only; secondary chipping along edges.

Type F:

Deeply side notched with expanding stem having convex
base; sides also tend to be convex above stem; some
secondary chipping from use or rubbing as flakes are
very irregular resulting in slight serration.

Planes
Type A:

Small, heavy flint river boulders with one end knocked
off and rounded by unifacial percussion flaking; char-

266

acteristic end is concave, rounded and slightly longer on
one side than the other, has a high, steep side; some
secondary flaking along the edge with moderate serration; favorite material at this site for this tool is brown,
iron patinated "Boone Chert."

Type B:

As above but made from cores rather than natural
shapes; other characteristics the same with unifacial
percussion flaking.

Type C:

Modification of a natural form but material is a flatter
block of black slate; function may have been that of a
chopper; a general al~ea of percussion tends to result
in a more ovoid form to fit the pahn; the under side
is a flat plane with a rough natural surface while the
upper surface is rounded; chopping edge tends to be
convex while the top or grasping end is the natural
flat smfface of the stratum; the angle of percussion of
the chopping edge is steep; percussion is unifacial.

Spud

Spatulate shaped tool; a stem with parallel sides below
a blade in the shape of a half moon; material--hard,
black slate river rock; chipped along edges and sporadically on both faces; carefully made and fairly symmetrical. Stem or handle flares into head like a large
Gary point. Might have been form of digging tool
though surfaces show no use-polishing.

Scrapers
Type A:

An unusual form of core scraper
longitudinally split boulder or flint
worked edges--one edge being on
the other on a concave edge on the

made from a large,
block; has unifacial
the convex surface,
opposite side.

Type B:

A triangular shaped flake; roughly percussion flaked
with unifacial flaking on alternate faces producing an
alternate bevel; some secondary chipping over the point
area. Could be classified as a point if the shape were
more definite or as a blade if thicker.

Type C:

Reworked faulty Gary point with scraper edge on convex side of point; percussion chipped with secondary
chipping on edge and high centered face.

Type D:

Flint flakes and chips slightly worked or showing use;
used as multiple purpose tools in scraping, sawing and
cutting.

Type E:

Thumbnail end scraper from Area A of Boone Chert;
Triangular shape, straight base side notched above
symmetrical in shape; specimen from Area D of irregularly surfaced chip, unifacial, secondary chipping
on end only--forming steep angle, sides unworked, also
made from Boone Chert.
