The society was organized and chartered in
pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking;
for the study of the history, pre-history and the
rna j or artifacts of man and the fossils representing the past floras and faunas of Texas; for the
encouragement of the proper collection and preservation of such artifacts and fossils in museums
and their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident
thereto.
The

ANOTHER PUEBLOAN TRADE SHERD
IN EAST TEXAS
E.

w. HAYNER

Five potsherds representing trade from the Puebloan
Indians of the Southwest to the Caddo of East Texas have
previously been described. 1 They were found in Lamar,
Red River, Cass, Franklin, and Shelby counties. The one
farthest east, a sherd of Chupadero Black-on-white originating in eastern New Mexico, was found in Shelby County,
about 30 miles west of the Louisiana border. The other
four were of types originating farther west, in the Upper
Gila area of western New Mexico, although these types
may have spread more widely over southern New Mexico
before trade with the Caddo Indians began. In New Mexico.
all five sherds would fall within the general period of 1200
to 1500 A. D. In East Texas, three of the five , including the
Chupadero, came from sites assigned to the Titus Focus.
Fulton Aspect, but the association of the other two was not
determined. The Titus Focus has also been estimated to
have existed during part or all of the time between 1200
and 1500 A. D.
This report deals with a sixth Puebloan trade sherd in
the Caddo area. It was found in the spring of 1951, catalogued as No. 4-L.3, and placed in storage, where it remained
until May, 1955, when Dr. Krieger briefly visited my base
camp on Caddo Lake. He became very interested in this
sherd, thinking it might be from the Pueblo culture. and
that if so, it would be farther east than any of the others.
It was Krieger's suggestion that the sherd should be sent
first to Dr. James B. Griffin, director of the Ceramic Repository of the University of Michigan, to see whether it
might belong to any known type in the Eastern United
States. However, Dr. Griffin was unable to identify it.
Krieger then suggested I send it to Mr. Stanley Stubbs,

Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico, a noted
authority on Southwestern pottery types. Fortunately,
Stubbs was able to report on it as follows:
"After comparing your sherd with many examples in
our collections, I would be inclined to place it as coming
from central Arizona in the general Salt River-Tonto
Creek area. The type is variously named, but fits in the
Mogollon brownware series, often called 'undifferentiated
brownware'. The only trouble is that the series covers a
rather long time span-at least 500 years-and regional
extensions. It would be difficult to pin it down to any
exact date. Your sherd has a little better finish than the
average from the Tonto area, but it is not extreme. It
was finished by the paddle-and-anvil method, and the
temper is also characteristic of many of the brownware
specimens from that area. My guess is: this sherd is
Mogollon brownware from the Tonto area of Arizona.
Charlie Steen of the National Park Service office in Santa
Fe, who has done considerable work in that region, also
feels that the sherd is Mogollon." (Letter received in October, 1955).
The sherd is shown full size in Plate 40. It measures
em. long, 8 em. wide, and 1.4 em. thick. It was found on
archeological site on the south shore of Caddo Lake,
land formerly owned by the writer and now owned
Curtis Roark.

The site is in Harrison County, about two miles from the
Louisiana border. The Mogollon sherd is therefore farther
east than any of the five described by Krieger, and its source
area is also farther west, in Arizona rather than New Mexico. The straight-line distance between Caddo Lake and the
Tonto basin is between 950 and 1,000 miles, but any practicable route of travel between the two areas would have
been at least 1,200 miles. This is a long way for Indian trade
goods to travel. However, the writer has a celt found in
East Texas which is made of basalt granite which occurs at

only two places in the United States: in Idaho and Massachusetts.
The site from which the Mogollon sherd came is a small
sandy "pimple mound" about 150 yards from the present
shore of the lake. It has so far yielded only five other
artifacts: a pitstone of brown flint; a combined mano and
pitstone of native sandstone; a mano of gray granite; and a
small square block of native sandstone with a groove cut
around it by which it could have been hafted and used as
a weapon. The site has not yet produced any flint chips or
other pottery, which indicates it might belong to the Archaic Stage. However, it has not been completely explored .
If this site is really Archaic, we may be wrong in supposing the Mogollon sherd was traded to the Caddo Indians,
for Caddoan culture in East Texas can only be proved with
the appearance of pottery and other distinctive artifacts of
the Gibson and Fulton Aspects. It must be pointed out that
only a quarter of a mile south of this site there is a large
mound which does have Fulton Aspect pottery on its top.
It may be possible that pre-Caddoan people brought trade
material into East Texas from the Southwest, but as of this
date this question cannot be definitely answered.
