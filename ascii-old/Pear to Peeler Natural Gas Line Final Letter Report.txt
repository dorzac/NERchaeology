Natural Gas Line, Atascosa County, Texas

Dear Ms. Vader,
This letter provides a Final Report of our cultural resources survey of the Pear to Peeler Natural Gas
Line right-of-way (Figures 1-3).
The right-of-way (ROW) was examined by two archaeologists on December 7, 2015. Our
observations of the Project Area revealed that virtually the entire length of the pipeline has been
disturbed in historic times, and at the time of our survey the ROW was covered in secondary low
mesquite brush, other thorny brush, and prickly pear and tasajillo cacti, or otherwise coursed through
a recently cultivated field (Figures 4 and 5).
A thorough pedestrian survey of revealed no evidence of cultural material, and the intermittent
drainage crossed on the southwestern portion of the right-of-way is broad and ephemeral, with no
evidence of terrace building. Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the
Pear to Peeler Natural Gas Line as it is currently planned be allowed to proceed with no further
archaeological investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development along the pipeline, such finds
should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
If there any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

David L. Nickels
Principal Investigator/Project Archaeologist
