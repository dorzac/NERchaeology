Abstract
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey along 12.62
kilometers (7.84 miles) of Farm to Market Road (FM) 548 in Kaufman and Rockwall
Counties, Texas on February 12–16, 2018. The project is sponsored and overseen by
the Texas Department of Public Safety (TxDOT) under CSJ numbers 2588-01-017 and
2588-02-008 and was surveyed under Texas Antiquities Permit 8315. The project extends
northeast from Forney, Texas, north of U.S. Highway (US) 80 to State Highway (SH) 205.
Using a potential-based survey methodology, areas were identified by inspecting historic
aerial imagery and topographic maps and areas within the Area of Potential Effects (APE)
identified by the TxDOT Dallas Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) as having
moderate to high geoarcheological potential for buried sites. These areas were selected
for intensive survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5.
Two newly discovered historic-age sites (41KF174 and 41KF175) were observed and
recorded within the APE. Both sites are early to mid-twentieth century farmstead sites
with sparse scatters of mid-century artifacts. Site 41KF174 contains a concrete slab,
most likely from the porch of a structure that has been subsequently removed from the
property. Site 41KF175 contains a partially collapsed brick-lined water well. Neither site
meets any criterion for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and are therefore recommended as ineligible. However,
future work outside the current APE may require further investigation of 41KF175, which
extends south, outside the proposed right-of-way (ROW).
No further archeological work is recommended for the proposed improvements to FM 548
and construction is recommended to proceed.
All land surveyed was privately-owned and will be acquired as new ROW or for use as
permanent drainage easements. No artifacts were collected during investigations. All
notes and forms generated during fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Management Summary
On February 12–16, 2018 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) carried out an intensive
survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. Joel Butler acted as
principal investigator, Heath Bentley as field director, and Danielle Blut as field technician.
Seventy-two person-hours were expended during fieldwork. Seventy-four shovel tests and
three backhoe trenches were excavated in support of the survey.
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Dallas District proposes to widen and
make improvements to Farm to Market Road (FM) 548 from U.S. Highway (US) 80 in the
City of Forney to State Highway (SH) 205 in Kaufman and Rockwall Counties, Texas. This
project is assigned CSJ numbers 2588-01-017 and 2588-02-008 and the archeological
survey was carried out under Antiquities Permit 8315. The total project length is 12.62
kilometers (7.84 miles) with a total approximate Area of Potential Effects (APE) of 169.76
acres, 98.26 acres of which are existing right-of-way (ROW), 63.49 acres of proposed new
ROW, and 8.01 acres of permanent drainage easements.
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section
106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled
by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway
Authority (FHWA).
Areas targeted for survey were identified using a potential-based survey methodology.
Historic aerial imagery and topographic maps were inspected for potential historic-age
sites and areas within the APE identified by the TxDOT Dallas Potential Archeological
Liability Map (PALM) as having moderate to high geoarcheological potential for buried
prehistoric sites were selected as well. The selected high potential areas were subject to
intensive survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. As a result of
this selection process, approximately 23,150 linear feet (7,050 meters) of proposed ROW
encompassing 27.8 acres were surveyed; the existing ROW was observed to be entirely
disturbed from existing drainage improvements, utilities trenching, and road construction
activities.
Two newly discovered historic-age sites (41KF174 and 41KF175) were observed and
recorded within the APE. Both sites are early to mid-twentieth century farmsteads containing
limited structural remnants and sparse artifact scatters. Neither site meets any criterion
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) and are therefore recommended as ineligible within the project area.
However, site 41KF175 may extend south of the proposed ROW and further investigation
may be required if future work in the vicinity has potential to impact the site.
No further archeological work is recommended for the current undertaking and construction
is recommended to proceed.
All land surveyed was located on private property. No artifacts were collected during
investigations. All notes and records generated during fieldwork will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Chapter 1

Introduction
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey of proposed
improvements along 12.6 kilometers (7.3 miles) of Farm to Market Road (FM) 548 from
north of U.S. Highway (US) 80 in the City of Forney to State Highway (SH) 205 in Kaufman
and Rockwall Counties, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Under management of the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Dallas District, proposed new right-of-way (ROW)
for widening and improvements to the existing roadway is planned. This project is being
constructed under TxDOT CSJ numbers 2588-01-017 and 2588-02-008 and field survey
was carried out under Antiquities Permit 8315. Detailed schematics and typical sections
are presented in Appendix A. The project area is depicted on Forney North, Forney South,
and Terrell North, Texas 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles, as seen in Figure 1.
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section
106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled
by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway
Authority (FHWA). As described in the Programmatic Agreement between FHWA, TxDOT,
and the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation, FHWA projects in Texas are administered by TxDOT. Therefore, the field
survey and this report adhere to TxDOT guidelines and requirements.
Currently, FM 548 consists of two 12-foot travel lanes, three-foot wide shoulders, and
open ditches. The proposed roadway would include six total lanes (two 12-foot wide inside
lanes, one 14-foot wide outside shared-use lane with two-foot wide curb offsets on each
side), as well as proposed sidewalks for the length of the project. The proposed alignment
typically matches the existing alignment, though the existing horizontal curve south of
University Drive will be realigned. The proposed project includes the replacement of an
existing bridge structure over Big Brushy Creek as well as replacement of five existing
bridge class culverts and four non-bridge-class culverts over minor ephemeral drainages.
The proposed typical section includes closed drainage (curb-and-gutter and storm sewer)
along FM 548 for the entire length of the project.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of
the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact, including all easements, and project
specific locations. Thus, the APE for archeological resources would cover a total distance
of 7.84 miles with a typical width of 140 feet. The total APE for the project is 169.76 acres
with 98.26 acres of existing right-of-way (ROW), 63.49 acres of proposed ROW, and 8.01
acres of proposed permanent drainage easements. The vertical APE would extend less
than four feet deep throughout the majority of the project area except in areas of proposed
bridge replacements (see also schematics and typical sections in Appendix A). In those
locations, proposed impact depths would exceed 20 feet.

The purpose of the archeological survey was to identify whether any archeological sites
would be affected by the proposed roadway improvements. Fieldwork was carried out
on February 12-16, 2018. Joel Butler acted as principal investigator, Heath Bentley as
field director, and Danielle Blut as field technician. Heath Bentley assisted in writing this
report. Seventy-four person-hours were expended during fieldwork and 74 shovel tests and
three backhoe trenches were excavated in support of investigations. No difficulties were
encountered during the survey. Weather was mild and overcast with dry soil conditions.
Two archeological sites were documented during fieldwork, 41KF174 and 41KF175.
No artifacts were collected during field investigations. All notes and records generated
during fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin.
This report is divided into five chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 includes the field methodology implemented during the
project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents
the summary and recommendations. Appendix A contains detailed schematics and typical
sections of the proposed project, survey results are plotted on aerial photographs in
Appendix B, and shovel test results tables are presented in Appendix C.

Environmental Setting and Cultural Background
Physical Setting
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie, a sub-region of the Blackland
Prairie ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2009). This ecoregion is defined by fine textured
clayey soils and predominantly prairie vegetation (Griffith et. al 2007) that includes an
assortment of perennial and annual grasses (Texas A&M 2015) such as little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), yellow Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (Griffith et. al 2007). The
Northern Blackland Prairie subregion was historically defined by tallgrass prairie vegetation
that was subject to frequent prairie fires that discouraged the growth of woody plants.
Riparian areas and stream bottoms were historically forested with bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), elm (Ulmus
spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and pecan (Carya)
(Griffith et. al 2007). Since large scale farming was introduced into this region in the late
1800’s and early 1900’s almost all of the native prairie grass communities have been
replaced by cropland and non-native pasture grasses such as Johnson grass (Sorghum
halepense), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), or King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa
ischaemum) (Griffith et. al 2007).
Vegetation within project area is a mixture of open prairie rangeland, developed commercial
or residential properties, and active cropland. Surface visibility throughout the area is
generally poor (less than 30 percent).

Geology and Soils
Topographically, the APE ranges in elevation from 476 to 511 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). The APE occurs 3.8 miles east of the East Fork Trinity River and crosses Big Brushy
Creek and several unnamed intermittent streams that flow into Mustang and Big Brushy
Creeks (AgSite 2017). The APE is underlain mostly by the Upper Cretaceous Neylandville
Marl (Knm) with Quaternary alluvium (Qal) along Big Brushy Creek. An underground
aqueduct crosses the project area near its north end (BEG 1992). According to the United
States Department of Agriculture –Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS)
Web Soil Survey (2017), soils within the APE consist of Burleson clay (0–1 percent and 1–3
percent slopes), Ferris-Heiden complex (2–5 percent slopes), Heiden clay (3–5 percent
slopes), Houston black clay (0–1 percent and 1–3 percent slopes), and Trinity clay (0–1
percent slopes, occasionally to frequently flooded; Table 1). Soils are characterized by clay
and silty clay to depths of more than 200 centimeters (6.5 feet) below the surface.

Dallas PALM
The Potential Archeological Liability Mapping (PALM) of the Dallas District classifies the
majority of the study area as low potential for archeological resources except along Big
Brushy Creek and its tributaries (Figure 3). The PALM is “an assessment of the shallow and
deep geoarcheological potential, or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural
materials” (Abbott 2011: 160). The proposed project consists of six named soils (see Table
1) with overall low geoarcheological potential. The PALM units correspond with the soils
data for the area.

Previous Archeological Work
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; THC 2016) and a
review of historical maps and aerial photographs. Research focused on the identification
of archeological sites, sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Recorded
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological surveys within 0.62 miles
(one kilometer) of the APE (Figure 4). The search identified six previously conducted
archeological surveys, one documented archeological site, and one cemetery. No RTHLs
or Historical Markers were recorded within one kilometer of the project area. Four of the
six archeological surveys cross or parallel the APE, while the remaining surveys are located
within 0.62 miles of the APE. No archeological sites, are locted within the APE.

Surveys
A total of six previously-conducted archeological surveys fall within one kilometer (0.62
mile) of the proposed project (Table 2). Of these surveys four overlap with the proposed
project area. Only two surveys resulted in the recording of archeological sites. All of the
sites were historic in age and none overlap with the APE.

Archeological Sites
Site 41KF149 is the only site that is located within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the
proposed project area. This is an early twentieth century house located south of the Dallas
to Tawakoni Pipeline. At the time of the site’s recording, investigators did not have access
to the property; thus, only visual observations from the existing ROW were made. However,
recorders recommended NRHP eligibility testing in the event the property would be affected
by the proposed pipeline. According to the Atlas, eligibility remains undetermined.

Cemeteries
The Prairie View Cemetery (Cemetery ID Number: KF-C036), also referred to as the
Oakhurst Cemetery, is located along the south side of East Broad Street in Forney, at
the southern terminus of the APE. The cemetery contains approximately 566 interments,
the earliest of which date back to the early twentieth century (ca. 1904). The cemetery
is located approximately 0.75 miles to the southwest of the project area and will not be
directly impacted by the proposed project.

Regional Cultural Chronology
This section provides a condensed summary of the archeological data collected in the
North-Central region of Texas. To date, archeological investigations in the North-Central
region of Texas have not been as extensive as adjacent regions (i.e., Central Texas, West
Central Texas, Northeast Texas, and Deep East Texas; see Perttula 2004:7), and better
understood regions will be referenced when relevant.

Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the Americas occurred between 16,000 and 14,500 before present
(BP) (Gilbert et al. 2008, Pitblado 2011), and until recently, it was generally thought that
the Paleoindian Period in Texas did not begin until around 12,000 BP (Perttula 2004).
However, new evidence from the Debra Friedkin and Gault sites in Central Texas have
begun to push the date of earliest occupation back to around 15,000 BP (Swaminathan
2014; Gault School 2016). The Paleoindian period in the north central region of Texas
dates prior to 8500 BP (Prikryl 1990). As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian
materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Plainview
projectile points entered the archeological record. One of the oldest confirmed Clovis sites
in North America is arguably the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479) in Denton County, Texas,
with a carbon date assay of 11,550 BP (Ferring 2001). This site yielded lithic material that
can be sourced to distant locations and was used to manufacture a wide variety of tools
(blade tools, flake tools, end scrapers, and gravers). Other notable Clovis sites recorded
in the northern portion of Texas include the Sam Kaufman site in Red River County, and a
smaller site in Lamar County. This site yielded a single Clovis point, a single Folsom point,
and three Dalton points (Story 1990:180). Some Paleoindian sites, like 41RR18 in Red
River County, contain deeply buried deposits such as hearth features 1.8 meters below
ground surface (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:73).
Typically, Paleoindian points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden
spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such
as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989).
In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely harvested smaller prey including

antelope, turtles, and frogs, etc. Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred
during this later portion of the period, eventually shifting to the Dalton, Scottsbluff, and
Golondrina traditions. While widespread in geographic range, these projectile types
occurred in high densities in the High Plains and Central Texas (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler
(Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to drier and warmer
conditions during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off
during the shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and
plant foraging.

Archaic
The Archaic period, broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic sub-periods,
signifies a more intensive reliance on local floral and faunal resources with an increase in
the diversity of projectile point styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record demonstrates
a heavier reliance on food processing, a wider variety of site functions, and more localized
geographic distributions of artifacts.

Early Archaic
According to Prikryl (1990), the Early Archaic spans the period of 8500–6000 BP. Prikryl
(1990) suggests there was a lack of regional differences in adaptive patterns during
this time. Subsistence data for this region of Texas during the Early Archaic is somewhat
scarce (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). Around 8000 BP, projectile point styles transitioned
from unstemmed to stemmed varieties such as the Martindale and Uvalde points (Black
1989). As the extinction of megafauna herds took hold, a subsistence shift towards elk,
deer, pronghorn, fish, and plants became necessary.

Middle Archaic
Many Early and Middle Archaic sites have been documented within North-Central and
Northeast Texas, but separation of the components has proven problematic. Diagnostic
points from this period in the north-central portion of Texas include Dawson, Wells,
Carrolton, Morrill, and Basal Notched forms (Prikryl 1990). The R. W. Watts Site Number
2 (41CP14) in Camp County exhibited dense midden deposits and burned rock features
dating to the Middle and Late Archaic, with possible earlier components (McKay et al.
2003:14). The Wild Bull site in Henderson County (41HE61) also contained Middle and
Late Archaic lithic assemblages and a burned rock feature (McKay et al. 2003:14). The
Calvert Site (41DN102) in the Trinity Valley of Denton County has a significant Middle
Archaic component. Data from this site suggest a drier Middle Holocene landscape, more
mobile populations, and subsistence economies based on smaller game such as deer
(Ferring and Yates 1997:30).

Late Archaic
Prikryl places the Late Archaic period from 3500 to 1250 BP and observes at least
three increases in site frequency relative to the Middle Archaic period (1990). Cultural
adaptations and regional differentiation appears more saliently in many sites, suggesting
possible increases in population saturation (Sabo and Early 1990:54). The frequency of
open campsites appears to increase, but the scales of sites tend to be smaller. Smaller
game such as deer continues to be exploited along with plants, the latter of which is
indicated by an increase in lithic tools associated with plant processing activities (Brownlow
et al. 1999). Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake
Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and Yates 1987) in Dallas County, Texas
suggest that deer and small animals were the primary Late Archaic food resources. Late
Archaic points include Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent, and Gary points. Refuse
pits observed throughout North Texas may suggest ritual feasting, indicating a possible
sociopolitical transition during this time (Bruseth and Martin 1987). A nearby Late Archaic
site from the Early Ceramic period, which coincides with the Woodland phase, is situated
in Hopkins County, Texas (the Hurricane Hill site, 41HP106). Simple ceramics and smaller
dart points are typical of the Woodland phase (Greaves 2003).

Late Prehistoric
There exists some degree of overlap between diagnostic tools that are considered Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric, but the commonly held date for the beginning of this interval
is 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric in North Central Texas is divided into two phases: Late
Prehistoric I (1250–750 BP) and Late Prehistoric II (750–250 BP) (Prikryl 1990). A hallmark
transition for Late Prehistoric I is the introduction of the bow and arrow, which enabled
prehistoric hunters to harvest prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless,
wide open spaces required for atlatl maneuverability in hunting. The use of arrows in the
north-central portion of Texas is demonstrated by the presence of smaller-sized projectile
points such as the Alba, Catahoula, and Scallorn types (Prikryl 1990:58). Late Prehistoric II
exhibits a steady increase in populations. Other technological traits include the regionally
ubiquitous Perdiz point, alternately beveled bifaces, and specialized processing kits as
an adaptation to flourishing bison populations (Ricklis 1992). There is also evidence of
early horticulture as Woodland communities continue to grow in the Low Plains area and
Caddo communities thrive in East Texas (Perttula 1995). The transition from the Late
Archaic Woodland to the Caddoan is evidenced by significant changes in technology and
subsistence. Distinctive ceramic vessels and decorative styles, burial practices, mound
architecture, and agriculture subsistence are seen in the subdivisions of the Caddo era.
Caddo lithic tool kits consisted primarily of arrow points, drills, utilized flakes, and celt
fragments (Story 1990). Ceramics are more widely used during this period, and typically
consist of fine-ware red-slipped ceramics, particularly along the Red River (Perttula 1995).
Over a dozen Formative to Middle Caddoan sites have been recorded within Red River and
Lamar Counties (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:125–129). Evidence from the Harrell Site
(41YN1), in Young County, suggests that interaction between Toyah and Caddo groups took
place in North and North-Central Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).

Historic Period
Europeans entered Texas starting around AD 1528, but visited only sporadically, and did
not settle in the region until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the continuous
threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas,
the Spanish erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth
century. Eventually, the newly independent Mexican government began granting impresario
contracts to allow more prominent Euro-American settlement to facilitate development.
Stephen F. Austin, one such settler, eventually spearheaded a movement by Anglo and
Mexican settlers against Mexican authority and towards independence.
The project area was historically occupied by several Caddo tribes. In the early nineteenth
century, Cherokee from east of the Mississippi relocated into the area of present-day
Dallas (Bass 2010; Hart 2010). In the 1840s, Anglo-Americans settled the area and by
the middle of the decade, the National Road of the Republic of Texas was surveyed and
constructed through Rockwall County (Bass 2010). This road ran from the Red River to
the Dallas area and was a major route for settlers moving into Peters Colony at the site of
present day Dallas (Bass 2010; Hart 2010).
Occasionally, flooding would occur along the Trinity River and prevent settlers from
crossing it while making their way westward. A camp was established at the east bank of
the East Fork of the Trinity River for settlers waiting for the waters to recede. This camp was
eventually established as a permanent settlement and grew into what is now the city of
Rockwall. Cattle ranching on the prairies east of the Trinity River was the primary industry
in the early days of the settlement. In 1873, Rockwall County was established, and the city
of Rockwall became the County seat (Bass 2010).
The first settlement in Kaufman County began with the establishment of King’s Fort in
1840. The settlement at King’s Fort was renamed Kaufman and established as the county
seat of Kaufman County in 1851 (Hart 2010). The Texas and Pacific Railway was built
through Kaufman County in 1873, which made shipment of agricultural produce more
economical. The establishment of the railroad and the success of the cotton industry led
to the spread of cotton cultivation in Rockwall County and a fifty percent increase in the
population from 1880 to 1890. The cotton industry continued to grow as the cattle industry
declined into the early twentieth century (Bass 2010).
Historically, the region surrounding the project area consisted solely of agricultural fields.
1936 Kaufman County and 1923 Rockwall County soils maps depict standing structures
alongside both sides of what is now FM 548 (Figure 5). These structures were most likely
farmsteads. One school, the Miller School, was located at the corner of FM 548 and League
Ranch Road. Additionally, a small community named Colquitt is depicted on the 1923 map.
This small farming community was founded in the 1880s and never grew to more than
100 people in size. Structures dating to the early twentieth century can also be seen in a
1953 aerial photograph of the project area (Figure 6). During the construction of FM 548
in the late 1950s and later realignments and expansions, many of the farmsteads were

demolished. Today, urban development is encroaching from the south with the growth of
Forney; however, the majority of the region surrounding the project area remains devoted
to agricultural land use.

Archeological Site Potential
Based on historical maps and aerial photographs, the potential for intact historic-age
archeological sites is considered low throughout most of the project area except where
nineteenth and early twentieth century farmsteads or former farmsteads were plotted on
maps and observed in aerial photographs near the roadway. The areas with the greatest
potential for historic-age archeological sites were expected to occur near the former
location of the Miller School and at the former Colquitt Community. However, during
AmaTerra’s survey, neither of these locations were found to contain any archeological
sites or isolated artifacts. In general, the currently proposed project corridor encompasses
numerous disturbances, such as roadside drainage ditches, artificially contoured surfaces,
buried utilities, urban development, and agricultural fields, which reduce the potential for
intact, historic period archeological sites or features within the project area. Prehistoric
archeological site potential is also considered low throughout most of the project area.
In fact, according to the PALM (Abbott 2011) the majority of the proposed project area is
characterized by low geoarcheological site potential with the exception of Big Brushy Creek
where Trinity clay soil is prevalent. Therefore, while cultural resource potential is considered
low throughout most of the project area, locations along FM 548 once associated with
historic occupation, and areas bordering natural waterways have high or moderate
archeological site potential, where disturbances are minimal. In preliminary background
studies and Antiquities Permit scoping, an archeological survey was determined to be
required within areas of moderate and high probability.
Based on previous surveys, local soils, historic maps and aerial photographs, and the
Houston PALM, it was determined that archeological sites encountered within the project
area would, in the case of prehistoric sites, be potentially intact, stratified, and potentially
buried to depths of up to two meters (6.4 feet) at large stream crossings or, in the case of
historic-age sites, at or near the surface.

Field Methods
Survey Area Selection
The selection process for areas to be surveyed for archeological resources was carried
out by first selecting areas from 1953 aerial imagery, 1962/1963 USGS topographic
maps, and the 1923/1936 Rockwall and Kaufman County soil maps where structures
were identified. Structure locations where major impacts such as road construction,
commercial construction, or tightly-spaced neighborhoods had occurred were eliminated
from the survey area. Additionally, portions of the APE identified as having moderate and
high potential for prehistoric archeological resources on the Dallas PALM were selected
as requiring surface inspection, shovel testing, and selective backhoe trenching at major
stream crossings. As a result of this selection process, approximately 23,150 linear feet
(7,050 meters) of APE (including the proposed ROW as well as intact portions of the existing
ROW) were surveyed; these areas are depicted in the survey results maps (Appendix B).

Methodology
On February 12-16, 2018 AmaTerra carried out an intensive survey, implementing
methodology described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. Artifacts, if
encountered during field investigations, were to be documented and left where discovered
(not collected). Portions of the APE selected for survey were visually inspected and shovel
testing was conducted in accordance with the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas guidelines for linear surveys (16 tests per mile within a 100-foot wide survey area).
At that rate, it was anticipated that investigators would excavate 71 shovel tests within the
APE with additional tests excavated when delineating site boundaries, near known sites,
within the Archeological District, or wherever there appeared to be heightened potential
for archeological resources. Fewer tests would be excavated where the APE had been
obviously disturbed or where subsoil was exposed.
Shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) or to culturally
sterile soils/bedrock, whichever was encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests was
screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. The results of each shovel test were recorded on
standardized forms documenting soil conditions, visible horizons, disturbances, or cultural
materials present.
Because the Dallas PALM identifies the area around Big Brushy Creek as having high
potential to contain deeply buried archeological deposits, up to four backhoe trenches
were proposed at that location. Samples of excavated soil were screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth to closely inspect for artifacts present. Trenches were excavated up to 4.5
meters in length and to maximum depths of 2.4 meters below the surface. Streambank
profiles were drawn and photographed for each trench, which was backfilled immediately
after documentation was completed.

Survey Results
Cultural resources survey for the proposed improvements to FM 548 in Kaufman and
Rockwall Counties was conducted February 12–16, 2018. Investigations consisted of
windshield survey through 100 percent of the existing ROW coupled with pedestrian
survey, shovel testing, drainage profiling and backhoe trench excavation throughout the
high probability areas mentioned in the previous chapter. Pedestrian survey was conducted
through 100 percent of the areas with high probability to contain cultural resources where
access was granted. Shovel testing generally occurred at 100-meter intervals. Shovel
tests were excavated at closer intervals in select areas where archeologists determined
that probability was particularly high for buried archeological deposits. This included high
drainage banks and areas where structures are depicted on historic aerial imagery. A total
of 74 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated throughout the proposed
ROW (see Appendix B). Of the areas selected with potential of historic-age resources, two
were found to contain archeological sites (41KF174 and 41KF175). No prehistoric sites or
isolated finds were discovered no artifacts were collected during field investigations.
Weather conditions were seasonably mild and no difficulties affected the survey. The project
area was observed to contain mixed development, consisting of residential, commercial
agricultural and undeveloped land within the surveyed parcels. Previous disturbances
were largely limited to the existing ROW and low probability areas (excluded during the
survey area selection process) and included modern construction, utilities trenches,
landscaping, and drainage improvements. However, there is evidence of extensive earthmoving disturbances within the surveyed areas in Rockwall County, as demonstrated by
the presence of mottled clays, imported gravels, and visibly-leveled surfaces. In addition,
extensive plowed agricultural fields were present throughout many of the high potential
areas, which would potentially displace archeological deposits down to approximately 50
cmbs. All of these disturbances would heavily impact and/or destroy any archeological
resources present. Two low-lying marshy areas with saturated soils were encountered
within the surveyed areas: one which crosses the northeast end of parcel 7311 near the
center of the APE and another which is a part of an unnamed tributary of High Point Creek
in Rockwall County (see Appendix B). Pedestrian survey was conducted within these areas
but no shovel tests were excavated.

Shovel Testing
Shovel tests generally encountered very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark gray
(10YR 4/1) compact clay throughout the surveyed areas, with some slight variation in clay
color. Due to the restrictive nature of the clay, shovel tests were terminated at depths that
ranged from 10 to 80 cmbs. Shovel tests placed near drainages were generally excavated
60–80 cmbs due to the increased probability for deep deposits in these areas. A total
of three positive shovel tests were documented, all of which were located within the two
newly recorded sites. Shovel tests are plotted on survey results maps in Appendix B and
tabular data is presented in Appendix C.

Backhoe Trenching
All three backhoe trenches were placed on the banks of Big Brushy Creek (Figure 7). It
was the aim of investigations to excavate a backhoe trench within each quadrant of Big
Brushy Creek’s crossing of FM 548. Due to limited access, a trench was not excavated
south of FM548 on the east side of brushy creek. However, the east bank at this location
was investigated through manual shovel scraping of the streambank profile.
The three trenches exposed similar profiles of clay and silty clay with some horizontal
laminations of white silt from flood deposits (Table 3, Figures 8 and 9). All three trenches
were excavated to a maximum depth of 240 cmbs and were terminated at the maximum
reach of the bucket in BHT1 or upon reaching compact clay with no macroscopic inclusions
(in BHT2 and BHT3).

Streambank Profiles
Vertical shovel scraping of cut banks was conducted at five drainage crossings (plotted
on survey results maps in Appendix B). These profiles were scraped to examine the depth
of Holocene soils and survey for evidence of cultural materials in the cut banks. A total of
seven bank profiles were examined at this five crossings. Aside from Big Brushy Creek, all
drainage banks did not exceed a depth of 1.5 meters. Soils encountered were generally
consistent with those encountered in shovel tests and in backhoe trenches. Soil color was
typically consistent throughout the soil column with a change to dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay
and mottled yellow (2.5Y 7/8) clay near the bottom of the bank at depths that ranged
from 30 to 80 cmbs (Figure 10). Investigation of the east cut bank of Big Brushy Creek
observed a similar soil profile to what was encountered in BHT-2. No cultural materials
were encountered in any of the profiled cut banks.

Newly Recorded Archeological sites
41KF174
Site 41KF174 is a 0.41-acre farmstead with a concrete slab and buried debris of historic
age located on a short ovular landform along the southeast side of FM548 (Figure 11).
Situated at 530 feet above mean sea level (amsl) the site is enclosed within recently
constructed steel panel and wire fencing. This fenced area is bisected by an old dirt twotrack road and is bordered by a cattle pasture with level terrain on three sides. Three
mature pecan trees loosely border a concrete foundation slab within the fenced area.
This fenced area includes a steel-pipe cattle chute and is currently used as a loading and
working pen for cattle. Ground surface visibility was estimated at less than 10 percent
and was obstructed by grass in most areas. Patches of bare ground were observed in
portions of the site where surface visibility was 75 percent or greater. The site boundary
was defined by the presence of the concrete slab and historic-age artifacts recovered in
shovel tests.

Figure 12. Site 41KF174 site setting with Feature 1 (porch slab) in foreground.
Note modern cattle chute in background, photo facing south.

Feature 1 is a rectangular concrete slab that measures roughly two by six meters
(Figure 12). The pad is oriented parallel with FM548 and has flat squared edges. The
concrete is partially degraded and cracked throughout. No sign of engraving or etching
was observed on this feature.
A total of six shovel tests were placed within the site area, two of which contained historic
materials, all dating to the early to mid-twentieth century. Soils encountered in shovel
tests consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay that extended to the depth
of termination. One shovel test (DB-4) encountered dark yellowish brown silty clay in the
upper 10 cm. overlaying the very dark grayish brown clay layer mentioned above. One of
the positive shovel tests (DB-3) encountered a layer dark brown clay in the upper 20 cm.,
in which an undecorated whiteware ceramic body sherd was observed. All shovel tests
were excavated to depths that ranged from 30 to 50 cmbs and were terminated due to
the restrictive nature of the clay. One shovel test (DB-5) was terminated at 20 cmbs where
it encountered a buried PVC pipe. No artifacts were observed on the surface at this site.
Artifacts observed in shovel tests consisted of window glass (n=2), whiteware ceramic
(mentioned above) (n=1), a melted fragment of colorless bottle glass (n=1), wire nails
of various sizes (n=3) and brick fragments (n=7). At least three of these brick fragments
appear to have been burned. All artifacts were recovered from between zero and 30 cmbs.
A house is shown at the site location on a 1936 Soil Survey map, and was likely constructed
during the 1910s. A 1961 aerial photograph shows a house structure with an American

25

Archeological Survey of FM 548 from North of US 80 to SH 205, Kaufman and Rockwall Counties, Texas

foursquare style roof in between the concrete pad observed on the ground and FM548.
This style of roof construction is commonly attributed to the 1910s. In the 1961 photo, the
house has a rectangular back porch that corresponds to the location Feature 1 (Figure 13).
Through a comparison of the 1961 imagery with subsequent aerial photography (from
1961 to the present) it is inferred that Feature 1 is associated with the back porch of this
house. A 1968 aerial photograph of the site does not show the house or any of its remnants
at this location. A shadow from the trees at the site obscures the location of the concrete
pad. In this photo, the former location of the house has a dark discoloration compared to
the surrounding area. All brick fragments, melted glass and nails were recovered from
a single shovel test (HB-4) placed in the location of a house depicted on the 1961 aerial
photograph. Burned structural and domestic debris found at this location with the dark
coloration of the house site in 1968 aerial imagery implies that this house may have been
destroyed by fire between the years 1961 and 1968. No structures are present at this site
on any aerial imagery between 1961 and the present. Based on information from maps it
is confirmed that this house was present at the site location at least as early as 1936 and
was demolished or destroyed sometime in the mid-1960s.
According to deed records held by the Kaufman County Clerk, the property on which the site
is located is a 245-acre parcel that was part of the S. Smith Survey (Table 4). The property
is currently owned by Harlan Properties Inc. and has passed between Harlan Properties
and TCI Thornwood Apartments LLC between 2002 and 2011. Prior to purchase by the
two development companies, the parcel was owned by W. R. Evans beginning in 1983
and W. E. Armentrout in 1979. The earliest records available for review at the Kaufman
County Courthouse lists the passage of the property between members of the Chapman
family between 1963 and 1979. The 1963 deed (455/467) describes the property as the
“Chapman tract”, which may imply that this family owned the property during the site’s midcentury occupation. According to the U.S. Census, Finis G. Chapman was a professional
car cleaner living in Dallas in 1930. In 1940 he is listed as a farmer with “other sources
of income” and lived in Kaufman County with his wife Lillie Chapman. According to the
census of this same year, Finis and Lillie lived in the same house in 1935. This timetable
corresponds to the appearance of the house on historic maps and the sale of the property
to Louis B. Chapman et ux in 1963, around the time that the house would have been
demolished.
Based on the results provided by map research, deed records and archaeological fieldwork,
this house was most likely built sometime around the early 1910s and occupied by Finis
G. and Lillie Chapman after they moved to Kaufman County from Dallas after 1930. The
artifacts recovered are broadly diagnostic of the early to middle twentieth-century and
likely reflect the occupation of the house towards the middle twentieth century based
on the inclusion of the wire nails. Due to the lack of diverse and informative diagnostic
artifacts observed at the site, it is unlikely that this site contains additional buried artifacts
that could contribute information regarding occupation at the site. Aside from the results
obtained from survey, map analysis and deed research, this site has little potential for
future research. Therefore, this site is not recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP
or as an SAL.

41KF175
Site 41KF175 (Figure 14 and 15) is a historic-age farmstead site located on the southeast
side of FM548 along the bank of an unnamed tributary of Brushy Creek containing buried and
surficial historic artifacts and one feature (a collapsed well). The site is currently bordered
by a stock tank with a large associated earthen berm oriented parallel to FM 548. Much
of the site is relatively clear of vegetation, while the portion along the unnamed drainage is
occupied by a thinly wooded area of eastern red cedar and elm trees. A dense line of trees
occurs along the boundary of these two areas and is oriented perpendicular to FM548.
The site boundary was determined based on the locations of the well, a single positive
shovel test and surface historic-age debris. The site occupies an area that measures 0.42
acres. The site area is covered in a bed of grass that is patchy in places with bare ground
exposed. Surface visibility ranges from zero to 25 percent throughout the site area.
Feature 1 is a buried and partially collapsed brick well (Figure 16). While initially thought to
be a cistern, subsequent research determined that it was about 20 meters (65 feet) from
the house and therefore most likely a water table well. The well consists of detached and
partially collapsed portions of an original partially above-ground structure. The uppermost
course of brick remains intact. This portion is partially collapsed, angled downward and
is detached from the lower portion of the well. The diameter measures approximately 1.5
meters. The well opening is exposed and lies slightly below the level of the ground surface.
This opening is currently covered by several wooden railroad beams. A short ovular earthen
berm that measures approximately five meters in diameter at its widest point in located
adjacent to the south side of the well. Water was present inside the body of the well at the
time of survey which obscured the interior and, by effect, made it impossible to estimate
the depth of the feature. The well is constructed of a single course of bricks. The bricks
inspected are all machine-manufactured bricks stamped with the label “FERRIS MED.
PINK” (Figure 17). Ferris bricks were manufactured first by the Ferris Press Brick Company
in Ferris, TX between 1901 and 1923, after which they became the Ferris & Reliance Brick
Company which was active into the 1980s (Steinbomer 1982). It is therefore probable that
the bricks used in lining the well were produced between 1901 and 1923.
In addition to the well, a diffuse collection of bottle glass fragments was observed across
the site surface in the wooded area along the drainage bank (Figure 18). An estimated 100
fragments of glass were observed and included green, amber and colorless body shards

along with two base portions. A variety of modern glass and other contemporary refuse
was observed in the adjacent drainage. A total of six shovel tests were placed within the
site area, only one of which contained for cultural materials. A total of 10 historic artifacts
were observed in shovel test DB13. These artifacts consist of the following domestic and
structural debris: whiteware ceramic sherds (n=2), bottle glass shards of light green (n=1),
colorless (n=5) and amber (n=1) colors and one wire nail (n=1). All artifacts in shovel test
DB13 were observed between 10 and 20 cmbs and date from the early to mid-twentieth
century.
Soils encountered in shovel tests consisted of clay of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2),
dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) and black (10YR 2/1) colors. This clay was consistent
through the vertical depth of each shovel test. Shovel tests at the site were excavated
to depths that ranged from 20 to 70 cmbs and were terminated due to restrictive clay
and upon encountering tree roots. Two shovel tests placed along the fence-line inside the
existing ROW encountered gravels mixed included in the clay. One shovel test (HB-10) was
placed on top of the small berm adjacent to the well and encountered mottled light gray
(10YR 7/2) clay. No artifacts were encountered in this shovel test and it is likely that this
berm represents fill excavated for the construction of the well.
The earliest evidence that was found of occupation of this site is a structure depicted at
this location on a 1936 Soil Survey map. A 1920s-style house appears on a 1961 aerial
photograph, depicted in Figure 19. The stock tank present at the site today was apparently
constructed between 1961 and 1968 based on a review of available aerial photographs.
The house is displayed on a 1974 topographic map but had been removed or demolished

by 1995. Given the style of the house and the use of the Ferris bricks, the house was likely
built in the early twentieth-century.
Site 41KF175 is located on a 240-acre parcel that is part of the S Smith Survey and is
currently owned by Forney ISD. Forney ISD purchased the property in 2003 from Clifford
Spratlan, and the south end of the parcel is now home to North Forney High School (Table 5).
According to deed records held by the Kaufman County Clerk of Court, Clifford Spratlan
obtained the property in 1995 from Kelly Jo Spratlan. A 1966 deed passed the property
from a Myrtle H. Senter, who was a widow, to her two daughters (each at one-half interest)
Helen Patterson and Kelly Jo Spratlan (495/116). The 1966 document refers to an earlier
deed (176/5) whereby Louise Duke grants the property to James F. Duke. The 1966 deed
details that the parcel once belonged to A. F. Duke and was “set apart to Burnie and James
F. Duke in the partition of the A. F. Duke Estate, a 467.1-acre parcel referred to as the “A.
F. Duke Tract” (495/116). According to a search in the United States census, Avery F. Duke
and his wife Louise Duke lived in Justice Precinct 2 (which now includes Forney and the
surrounding area) of Kaufman County in 1900 with their children. Their children at the
time include both James and Burney Duke. By 1910 the Duke family was living on Trinity
Avenue in Forney. As of the 1920 census, James F. Duke was living on Trinity Avenue and
operating a garage. In 1930 the Duke family was living in Kerrville. Given that the Duke
family was not living on a farm by the early twentieth-century when this house was likely
built, this house is likely associated with members of the Patterson or Senter families, of
which several members lived in Kaufman County in 1930 and 1940.
Given that the house is associated with the time when the Duke family was living in town,
it is most likely that the occupation of this site is associated with the Senter or Patterson
families during the early part of the twentieth-century. The single positive shovel test was
located on the edge of the proposed ROW. Therefore, it is probable that additional buried
materials remain outside of the proposed ROW where the house is depicted on the historic
aerial photographs. The remaining portion of the well and the buried material located within
the proposed ROW has little potential to provide additional data on the site’s occupation.
Therefore, this site is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL and
does not need to be avoided.

Summary and Recommendations
On February 12-16, 2018 AmaTerra carried out an intensive survey along FM 548, as
described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. The project was conducted
under the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA and all work conformed to the guidelines for
implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26 as well as 36 CFR 800. A
total of 72 person-hours was expended during fieldwork by Heath Bentley and Danielle
Blut. Seventy-four shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated in support of
the survey. Two historic-age archeological sites were recorded during field investigations,
41KF174 and 41KF175.
Site 41KF174 is an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead site consisting of a sparse
scatter of artifacts and a concrete slab (Feature 1), most likely from the porch of a structure
that has since been removed from the property. The site does not meet any criterion for
listing in the NRHP or as an SAL and no further work is recommended.
Site 41KF175 is an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead site consisting of a scatter
of artifacts and a partially collapsed brick-lined water well (Feature 1). While the site most
likely extends south of the project APE, 41KF175 is not eligible for listing in the NRHP or
as an SAL within the current undertaking’s ROW and no further work is recommended.
However, future work south of the surveyed area should evaluate the eligibility of any
potential intact portions of the site.
Construction is recommended to proceed for the project area without requiring further
archeological work.
The project APE included both public and privately-owned lands. All shovel tests were
located on private property. No artifacts were collected during investigations. All notes and
forms generated during fieldwork will be curated at TARL in Austin.
