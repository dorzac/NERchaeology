Abstract

ABSTRACT
Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to perform a
background review and cultural resources survey for the King Mountain to Roadrunner Solar 345-kilovolt
(kV) Transmission Line (Project) in Upton County, Texas. The survey was performed under Antiquities
Permit #8803. The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods
and results of the cultural resources background review and an archeological survey of an approximately
5.25 mile (8.45 kilometer [km])-long by 125 feet (38.1 meter)-wide proposed Area of Potential Effects
(APE) comprising 79.6 acres.
No previously recorded archeological sites or previously designated historic-age resources listed or
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL)were identified within the APE during the background review. An intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing was conducted between March 4 and March 8, 2019. Four prehistoric
archeological sites were recorded during the survey (Sites 41UT150, 41UT151, 41UT152, and 41UT153).
Three of the sites, 41UT150, 41UT151, and 41UT153, consist of burned rock scatters and remnant
thermal features associated with plant baking activities. Site 41UT152 is a ring midden of burned rock
with buried organics and two bifacial thinning flakes. Sites 41UT151 and 41UT153 are recommended
ineligible for the NRHP or designation as SALs, and site 41UT150 is recommended ineligible within the
project right-of-way. Further testing is needed to assess the eligibility of 41UT152 for NRHP listing or
designation as a SAL, and eligibility remains undetermined at this time. Burns and McDonnell
recommends avoidance of 41UT152 to prevent any adverse effects in association with the proposed
Project. As a result, no further consideration of impacts to historic resources under the Antiquities Code
of Texas or Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) is recommended in association
with the proposed Project. Burns & McDonnell requests concurrence that the Project would not adversely
affect historic properties and recommends no further cultural resources investigations of the APE in
association with the proposed Project. All project related paperwork will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Library (TARL).

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological survey for the King Mountain to
Roadrunner Solar 345-kilovolt (kV) Transmission Line (Project) northeast of McCamey, Upton County,
Texas (Appendix A: Figure A-1). The following report provides information regarding the Project and
includes the methods and results of the cultural resources background review and archeological survey
following the Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports.

1.1

Project Description

The Project involves construction of approximately 5.25 miles (8.45 kilometers [km]) of 345-kV
suspended power lines within GP&L’s proposed 125-foot (38.1-meters [m]) wide easement (Appendix A:
Figure A-1). The depth of impact is estimated to reach approximately 40 feet (12 m) below the

current ground surface. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is therefore defined as the total 5.25 miles
(8.1 km) long, 125 feet (38.1 m)-wide, 79.6-acre proposed transmission line to a maximum depth of 40

feet (12 m). The proposed Project is funded by GP&L, a not-for-profit municipal utility owned by the
City of Garland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Therefore, compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) is required. If the proposed Project requires a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
would also be required.

1.2

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. The archeological survey was conducted between March 4 and 8, 2019, by
archeologists Dan Rodriguez and Robert Brush under Antiquities Permit #8803 (Appendix B). Dan
Rodriguez served as Principle Investigator. Grant Cox provided GIS support.

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN

The overall objective of the background review and the cultural resources survey was to locate and assess
historic-age (50 years of age or older) properties or archeological sites listed or eligible for listing as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the APE
that could potentially be affected by Project construction. The following chapter provides information
regarding the sources consulted during the initial background review as well as the methods used during
the archeological survey.

2.1

Background Review Methods

A Burns & McDonnell archeologist performed an initial desktop review, including an examination of the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) to identify previously recorded archeological sites and other
previously identified historic-period resources extending 1-mile (1.6 km) (Study Area) from the proposed
Project (Appendix A: Figure A-2). This review included identification of NRHP-listed properties and
districts, SALs, historic-age cemeteries, and Official State of Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), such as
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), within the Study Area. The archeologist also used the
TASA to identify previous cultural resources surveys performed within the Study Area.
Additionally, the online Texas Geologic Map Data provided by U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Soil
Web supplied by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), historic-age maps provided by the
United States Geologic Service (USGS) Historic Topographic Map Explorer, and historic-age aerials
provided by Nationwide Environmental Title Research (NETR) were consulted These resources were
used to identify high probability areas (HPAs) for previously unrecorded cultural resources within the
APE (Appendix A: Figure A-2).

2.2

Archeological Survey Methods

Burns & McDonnell archeologists conducted a pedestrian survey along parallel transects spaced
approximately 30 m apart. Shovel tests were excavated at approximately 100-m intervals. Shovel tests
were approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated to a maximum depth of approximately
80 cm below surface (cmbs) or until pre-Holocene substrates were encountered. Soil matrices were
screened through 0.25-inch (0.65 cm) mesh when possible. Clayey matrices were hand-sorted and
visually inspected. All shovel tests were backfilled immediately after inspection. Additional shovel tests
were excavated to delineate the horizontal extent of archeological sites identified during the survey.
Additional 50 cm by 50 cm trowel tests were excavated to delineate the vertical extent of thermal features
identified during the survey. Shovel test and trowel test locations were recorded using Global Positioning

System (GPS) equipment. The field survey was performed in compliance with the ACT (Texas Natural
Resources Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, as amended) and the Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (THC 2014). Project records and
photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL).

Environmental Setting and Soils

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND SOILS

Understanding the region’s natural environmental and geological development contextualizes the region’s
cultural history and the survey results. The environment greatly influenced past human subsistence and
behavioral patterns and conversely, the environment has been significantly impacted through human
intervention. This section discusses the physiography, geology, soils, vegetation, and fauna of the Study
Area.

3.1

Physiography

Southwest Upton County is located in the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2017). The
Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion extends over 500 miles from the Madrean Archipelago in southeastern
Arizona, south into Mexico. The ecoregion, in much of the U.S. portion, is generally characterized by
basin and range terrain, with mountain ranges consisting of a geological mix of faulted limestone reefs,
rhyolitic intrusions, and volcanos and associated basalt and tuff extrusive rocks. The proposed Project
extends from King Mountain at an approximate elevation of 3100 feet above mean sea level to
approximately 2700 feet at the eastern terminus. The Project is crossed by four unnamed ephemeral
drainages that flow from the mountaintop.

3.2

Geology and Soils

Geologically, the Project is situated on the Washita Group, Fredericksburg Group, Quaternary deposits,
and alluvium (USGS 2019) (Appendix A: Figure A-3). The Washita Group includes alternating Early and
Late Cretaceous-age clay and limestone units that form much of the range topography of the region. The
Fredericksburg Group primarily consists of limestone, dolomite, chert, and marl dating from the Early
Cretaceous period. Quaternary deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravel indurated with caliche,
making up much of the basin topography of the region. Alluvial Deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and
gravel associated with floodplain and low terrace landform sediment assemblages. Soils within the
proposed APE are mapped as Reagan, Sanderson, and Tencee-Upton complex (NRCS 2019) (Appendix
A: Figure A-4). The Reagan soil series consists of very deep, loamy soils, formed in pre-Holocene
alluvium or eolian deposits derived from limestone. These soils occur on toeslopes, alluvial fans, or flats
with slopes less than 1 percent (NRCS 2019). Sanderson gravelly loam consist of very deep, well drained
soils formed in gravelly, calcareous loamy alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone. The
Sanderson series is located on fans and foot slopes of ridges on dissected plateaus (NRCS 2019). TenceeUpton complex soils consist of gravely loam and gravelly sandy loam formed in gravelly, calcareous
loamy slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone and marl. These soils are located on
nearly level to moderately sloping foot slopes or fans of ridges on dissected plateaus (NRCS 2019). Given

the age of these soils and the depositional environment in which they are located, cultural deposits in
these soils, if present are unlikely to be deeply buried.

3.3

Vegetation and Fauna

Vegetation of the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion primarily consists of semi-desert grasslands and arid
shrublands, with several species of oak (Quercus spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), and pinyon pine (Pinus
spp.) found at higher elevations. Natural vegetation includes grasses, shrubs, xeric plants such as
burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius), grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), river cane (Phragmites australis),
alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), and broomweeds (Amphiachyris and Gutierrezia spp.), fourwing
saltbush (Atriplex canescens), pickleweed (Allenrolfea occidentalis), Creosote bush ((Larrea tridentata),
tarbush (Flourensia cernua), saltcedar (Tamarix spp.), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), sotol
(Dasylirion spp.), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), pricklypear (Opuntia
spp.), and yucca (Yucca spp.) (Griffith et al. 2017).
Intensive, year-round cattle grazing during the late nineteenth century has drastically altered the
landscape, leading to gradual desertification and expanding shrublands within mountain foothills and
lowlands (Griffith et al. 2017). Wooded areas once dominated by riparian lowland trees and plateau live
oak (Quercus fusiformis) have been replaced by woody shrub species such as redberry juniper (Juniperus
pinchotii), ashe juniper (Juniperus. ashei), mohr oak (Quercus mohriana), and vasey oak (Quercus.
vaseyana) (Griffith et al. 2017).
The Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion supports numerous bird, lizard, and fish species such as muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.), kit fox (Vulpes velox macrotis), jackrabbits (Lepus
californicus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana),
blackthroated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), soft-shelled turtles (Apalone spp.), side-blotched lizard
(Uta stansburiana), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), little-striped whiptail lizard
(Cnemidophorus inornatus), Comanche Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon elegans), proserpine shiner
(Cyprinella proserpina), Rio Grande darter (Etheostoma grahami), and headwater catfish (Ictalurus
lupus) (Griffith et al. 2017).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Cultural Overview

Human occupation of the Southern Plains is divided chronologically into five cultural periods that span
over 11,500 years and include: Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, Protohistoric, and Historic (Perttula 2004;
Johnson and Holliday 2004). These divisions are marked by shifts in subsistence strategies and
technological innovations visible in the archeological record and through documented oral and written
histories. The following sections present an overview of the region’s cultural history and the associated
archeological and historic resources that could potentially be located within the study area.

4.1.2

Paleoindian

Archeological evidence suggests that people first lived within the region around 12,000 years ago. This
occupational phase is referred to as the Paleoindian period and extends from the end of the Pleistocene
Epoch until the early Holocene. The phase can be subdivided further into Clovis (11,500 to 11,000 B.C.),
Folsom (10,800 to 10,300 B.C.), and Late Paleoindian cultures, including Plainview (ca. 10,000 B.C.) and
Firstview (ca. 8,600 B.C.) (Johnson and Holliday 2004).
For decades, scholars commonly believed Paleoindian peoples traveled in highly-mobile hunting and
gathering bands living a nomadic lifestyle and exploiting, by choice, a limited number of resources.
However, more recent archeological research at the Aubrey and Lubbock Lake sites outside of Dallas and
Lubbock, respectively, has revealed evidence of a more diversified subsistence base that included small
and medium mammals in addition to the more traditional large and megafauna. The Folsom culture is
well represented at Lubbock Lake, and archeological investigations focusing on this period have provided
evidence of increased reliance on extinct species of bison for subsistence as well as shifting lithic
technologies (Carlson 2005).
Following the decline of the Folsom cultural phase, around 10,300 B.C., archeologists have identified a
series of varied cultural groups distinguished according to a wide range of projectile point styles.
Common Late Paleoindian points include Plainview and Firstview, but other points, some of which have
contracting stems, were also developed. It appears that people relied upon a diverse diet including plants
and small game as well as the continued exploitation of bison. Evidence of this subsistence strategy has
been documented at the Lake Theo site in Briscoe County and at Lubbock Lake (Harrison and Killen
1978; Johnson and Holliday 2004).

4.1.3

Cultural Background

Archaic

The start of the Archaic period (8000 to 2000 B.C.) coincides roughly with the start of the Hypsithermal
climatic episode that resulted in an overall warmer and drier climate (Hofman 1989; Kay 1998).
Consequently, a sudden extinction of mega fauna populations forced peoples to exploit faunal resources
in bottomland and forested areas (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Changes in overall subsistence practices
during the Archaic appear to have led to accompanying technological shifts. Stemmed (expanding and
contracting) and notched (corner and basal) projectile points began to be used, and hafting technologies
changed. The lithic toolkit was also expanded to include groundstone tools for the first time such as
manos, metates, and pestles.
During the Middle and Late Archaic period, there appears to have been further expansion of the lithic
toolkit. Varieties of stemmed, corner-notched, and shallow side-notched projectile points became
increasingly popular during this period, as did scrapers, perforators, drills, knives, grooved axes,
bannerstones, and plummets. The Archaic culture relied heavily upon bison as an important food source
along with other smaller game. There was also an increase in groundstone tool use, including manos and
pestles, a phenomenon that is believed to reflect further inclusion of seeds and nuts in people’s diets
(Blackmar and Hofman 2006).

4.1.4

Ceramic

The Early Ceramic period (2000 to 1000 B.C.) appears to have been a transitional time for peoples living
in the Texas Plains. Several new innovations, including pottery and the bow and arrow, were introduced.
Additionally, limited evidence of horticulture and the presence of storage features suggest people
continued a foraging lifestyle while moving toward a more sedentary existence (Johnson and Holliday
2004). Typical cultural markers for this time period include thick, conoidal-shaped ceramic vessels and
corner- and basally-notched arrow points.
Diagnostic artifacts of the Early Ceramic include corner-notched and stemmed arrow points and
brownware ceramics (Boyd 2004). Excavations at the Kent and Sam Wahl sites in the panhandle suggest
a continued foraging lifestyle with seasonal habitation sites and hunting and plant processing campsites.
Excavated features include burials, hearths, pits, burned rock features, and rectangular to oval pit houses.
During the Middle Ceramic period of the Texas Plains, people appear to have been primarily semisedentary horticulturists with semi-permanent to permanent residences. Artifact assemblages from this
period include cord-marked pottery, diamond-shaped beveled knives, triangular projectile points, distal
end scrapers, drills, bison bone digging sticks, and scapula hoes for practicing agriculture. It was during

Garland Power & Light

Burns & McDonnell

Cultural Background

this period that the first widespread permanent villages appear to have been established, typically on
ridges and terraces near perennial streams and arable land (Brosowske 2005). Subsistence strategies
included the harvesting of cultigens such as corn, squash, and beans, as well as hunting game and
collecting edible wild plants. Bison continued to play a major role in people’s diets (Brooks 2004).

4.1.5

Protohistoric

In general, scholars believe Apachean groups dominated the region during the period of European
contact, particularly the Lipan Apache with later incursions by the Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapahoe, and
Kiowa (Hofman 1989). Evidence from archeological excavations suggests people were primarily nomadic
bison hunters with some sedentary camp settlements and limited horticulture. The Tierra Blanca site in
Deaf Smith County contains some of the best evidence for protohistoric life on the Texas Plains. Features
include tipi rings, stone foundations, open hearths, and a semi-subterranean, slab-lined circular structure
(Hofman 1989).
The Comanche moved into the Texas Plains region during the eighteenth century. Originally from the
Great Basin region to the northwest, family bands and groups migrated south after the introduction of the
European horse, which drastically changed the Comanche social, economic, and political structure
(Wallace and Hoebel 1952). The Comanche were highly mobile, followed the seasons, and came together
to hunt bison. While groups of Lipan Apache, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other surviving
indigenous cultures continued to occupy the region during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the
Comanche dominated the Texas Plains during the Protohistoric period (Hofman 1989).

4.1.6

Historic

By the late nineteenth century most of the bison were gone and the Comanche were forced out of the
region by the U. S. Army and Anglo-American settlers. The first reported Anglo-American settler in the
county was Dr. George W. Elliot in 1881. The Chihuahua Trail, Butterfield Overland Mail, and
Goodnight-Loving Trail crossed the county. The area was part of the open range until the 1890s, when
sheep herders crossed the Pecos River to compete with cattlemen for the range. The population of Upton
county was only 52 people in 1890, and only 48 in 1900. According to the agricultural census for 1900,
there were 18 ranches that year with almost 39,000 cattle, but almost no crops were grown. The ranching
economy was affected when the State ended free use of public land in 1900. Agents were sent to collect
rents from ranchers on State land. Between 1901 and 1905, however, State law permitted sale of school
lands in West Texas, allowing individuals to purchase four sections of land with credit. Upton and other
west Texas counties experienced a rush of new settlers, which continued even after the law was changed
in 1905 to award land to the highest bidder. By 1910 there were 105 ranches or farms in the area, and the

Cultural Background

population had increased to 501. The county was organized that year, and Upland became the county seat.
The county was named for brothers John C. and William E. Upton, both colonels in the Confederate
Army (Hunt and Leffler 2016).
In 1911 the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway was constructed, bypassing Upland and by 1912
most of the people living in Upland had moved to Rankin. Rankin became the county seat in 1921.
Rankin became an oil boom town, supplying and servicing the Yates oilfield in Crockett and Pecos
counties. McCamey also developed to supply the oil fields and was serviced by the Santa Fe Railroad by
1926. By late 1927 several thousand people lived in McCamey. Water had to be freighted 10 miles from
Alpine and was sold at one dollar per barrel until 1929, when water from the Trinity sands wells 17 miles
away was piped into McCamey (Hunt and Leffler 2016).
The agricultural economy of Upton county developed slowly, and in 1930 there were only 36 ranches and
only 2 acres of crops were harvested in the entire county. However, the population grew dramatically
during the 1920s because of the oil boom and by 1930 there were 5,968 people living in Upton county.
The population declined during the early 1930s as the Great Depression drove oil prices down. The
population declined to 4,297 by 1940. Sheep ranching revived in the late 1930s, and cattle ranching
continued to decline. Oil production accelerated again in the 1940s after the beginning of World War II
and development of the area's oil continued after the war. McCamey's water system was expanded in the
1940s and 1960s, and with water resources McCamey became the power and oil field supply center for a
large part of West Texas. The county's population rose to 5,307 by 1950 and to 6,239 by 1960. Oil
production had begun to decline by the early 1970s and continues to drop (Hunt and Leffler 2016).

Results of the Background Review

RESULTS OF THE BACKGROUND REVIEW

Based on a review of TASA, two cultural resource surveys have been performed within the Study Area
(Table 5-1; Appendix A: Figure A-2). In January 2001, a cultural resources survey paralleling Highway
2463 was conducted on behalf of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). No additional information
regarding this survey was available on the TASA. On January 15, 2003, a cultural resource survey was
conducted on behalf of the U. S. Department of Agriculture Rural Utility Service (USDA-RUS). No
additional information regarding this survey was available on the TASA. No surveys have been
conducted within the proposed APE. In addition to the information on the TASA, Burns and McDonnell
has obtained a 2018 draft report of a due diligence survey of a solar farm and transmission line which
parallels the proposed Project (Anderson and Huntley 2018).

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

The following section outlines the results of the archeology survey of the approximately 5.25-mile (8.45km) APE (Appendix A: Figure A-5). Burns & McDonnell archeologists performed the intensive survey
between March 4 and 8, 2019. Ground surface visibility was generally greater than 50 percent across the
APE (Appendix D: Photograph D-1 though Photograph D-5). Disturbances within the APE included
current collocated transmission line ROW construction, previous oil and gas exploration, private roads,
and land clearing/grading. Archeologists excavated 190 shovel tests and two trowel tests within the APE
(Appendix A: Figure A-5; Appendix C). Shovel tests typically revealed either brown (7.5YR 5/3) silt
loam extending to 20 cm over light brown (7.5YR 6/4) argillic clay; or pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam
overlying indurated bedrock at approximately 20-30 cmbs. Four new archeological sites (41UT150,
41UT151, 41UT152, and 41UT153) were recorded.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Site 41UT150

Site 41UT150 is a prehistoric campsite located in a valley approximately 1.9 miles from Five Mile Creek.
Site 41UT150 measures approximately 50 m north-to-south by 38 m west-to-east but continues outside of
the surveyed right-of-way to the west and east (Appendix A: Figure A-6; Appendix D: Photograph D-6
through D-8). The site is situated within desert scrub brush with approximately 60 percent ground surface
visibility. Previous disturbances observed on site include slope wash, eolian erosion, and grading on the
southwest side, as well as a two-track road running down the middle of the site. A thin A soil horizon
appears to be irregularly present across the site, but erosion, likely exacerbated by the grading and
construction of the road, appears to have stripped most of the topsoil away.
Nine shovel tests were excavated, all of which were negative for subsurface cultural material. Shovel tests
revealed silt loam soil matching the Reagan soil series description (NRCS 2019). Artifacts observed on
the ground surface included between 500 and 1,000 fire-cracked rocks (FCRs). No lithics or other
artifacts were observed. The northeast side of the site appears very deflated and one feature, P1, was
observed east of the creek. Fire-cracked rock density on the northeast side of the site is approximately 1
FCR per 10 m2. The southwest side of the site has a much higher artifact density of approximately 3 FCR
per 1 m2 within approximately 10 m of the drainage, but quickly drops off to zero per m2 afterwards. One
feature, P2, was observed on this side of the site. The southwest side has small linear furrows which
suggests the area has been previously graded. Given the quantity of FCR, there were likely additional
cultural features on this side prior to the grading. The site and surficial FCR continues to the east outside
of the survey corridor.
Feature P1, on the northeastern side of the drainage, is an in situ remnant heating element (Appendix D:
Photograph D-9). Feature P1 is comprised of a single layer of FCR approximately 60 cm in diameter. The
feature is composed of limestone cobbles or cobble fragments measuring between 10-15 cm in diameter.
A 50 cm2 trowel test (Trowel Test 1) was excavated to 10 cmbs in the southeast quadrant of the feature
found no signs of organic staining and no charcoal was observed under lifted rocks of the feature
(Appendix D: Photograph D-10). Insect burrows were observed under every rock suggesting organics
would have likely been displaced or contaminated either way. Feature P1 likely represents the remnant
heating element of a single use oven given the large size and small number of FCR that make up the
feature.
Feature P2, on the southwest side of the drainage is a deflated limestone burned rock feature
approximately 100 cm in diameter (Appendix D: Photograph D-11). The feature is also composed of
fragmentary limestone measuring between 5-10 cm in diameter with one cracked in place rock measuring

Conclusion and Recommendations

between 10-15 cm. Trowel Test 2 was excavated to 10 cmbs in the southwest quadrant of the feature and
was also was negative for organic staining or charcoal beneath the lifted burned rocks (Appendix D:
Photograph D-12). The feature has likely been severely impacted by grading on this side of the drainage
and was likely larger in the past. Feature P2 likely represents more than one heating event as indicated by
the relatively small size of the FCR.

6.1.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41UT150 is a prehistoric campsite with two remnant burned rock features and associated FCR
scatter. The site is entirely surficial and appears to lack spatial integrity or datable organic material and
diagnostic artifacts which would provide significant information important to prehistory under NRHP
Criterion D. Therefore, the site is not recommended for NRHP inclusion, or for designation as a SAL,
within the surveyed right-of-way. Regardless, proposed tower locations will avoid the site.

6.2

Site 41UT151

Site 41UT151 is a prehistoric campsite located on the King Mountain mesa approximately 4.82 miles
from Five Mile Creek (Appendix A: Figure A-7; Appendix D: Photographs D-13 and D-14). Site
41UT151 measures approximately 19 m north-to-south by 12 m west-to-east. The site is situated within a
desert scrub brush and short, bunch grasses with 10 percent ground surface visibility due to the thick
vegetation. The site has been previously disturbed by slope wash and eolian erosion.
Nine shovel tests were excavated on the site. Of these, only shovel test DR79 was positive for subsurface
cultural material. Shovel test DR79 yielded 11 burned rock fragments between surface and 10 cmbs. No
organic staining or charcoal was observed in the shovel test. Artifacts were located between the surface
and 10 cmbs in silt loam soil similar to the mapped Reagan series (Appendix D: Photograph D-15)
(NRCS 2019). Additional artifacts observed at the site included between 100 and 200 FCR. Of the
observed burned rock, approximately 10 rocks measured between 5-10 cm in diameter. All the remaining
burned rocks were 5 cm in diameter or under (Appendix D: Photograph D-16). No features or other
artifacts were observed at the site.

6.2.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41UT151 is a prehistoric campsite with a surficial and shallowly buried FCR scatter likely
representing a deflated feature. The site has some cultural deposition but lacks evidence for datable
organic material or diagnostic artifacts. Site 41UT151 lacks significant information important to
prehistory under NRHP Criterion D. Therefore, the site is not recommended for NRHP inclusion, or for
designation as a SAL. Regardless, proposed tower locations will avoid the site by no less than 50 feet.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Site 41UT152

Site 41UT152 is a prehistoric burned rock midden located on King Mountain mesa approximately 4.75
miles northwest from Five Mile Creek (Appendix A: Figure A-8; Appendix D: Photographs D-17 through
D-20). Site 41UT152 measures approximately 18 m north-to-south by 30 m west-to-east. The site is
situated within a desert scrub brush and short, bunch grasses with approximately 50 percent ground
surface visibility. The site has been minimally disturbed by slope wash and eolian erosion.
Typical shovel tests conformed to the Tencee and Upton series with a silt loam overlying a dense
caliche/calcium carbonate layer and terminated at to pre-Holocene-age deposits or indurated bedrock
(NRCS 2019).
Artifacts observed on the surface at the site include 1,000 to 1,500 FCR and 2 tertiary flakes. The site
consists of a remnant ring midden, Feature P1, and a scatter of spoil FCR. The spoil FCR to the west is
slightly upslope from the midden feature and may be intact from the original removal events. Feature P1
measures approximately 8 meters in diameter and is comprised of an approximately 1.5-m wide band of
FCR which is evident almost all of the way around except for an eastern portion which was obscured by
vegetation.
Ten shovel tests were excavated on the site (see Appendix A: Figure A-8). Of these, only DR85 was
positive for subsurface cultural material. Shovel test DR85 was placed near the center of the midden ring.
This shovel test revealed organic staining, small charcoal flecks, and two in situ FCR fragments between
10 and 20 cmbs (Appendix D: Photograph D-21). Shovel Test DR85 was terminated at 20 cmbs so as not
to damage the datable component of the feature. Because preserved organics were encountered in the
shovel test, no additional trowel testing was conducted within the feature to preserve it for future study.
The ring midden consists of approximately 750 to 1,000 pieces of FCR mostly less than 5 cm in diameter.
Approximately 75 FCR measured between 5 and 10 cm in diameter and approximately 15 FCR measured
between 10 and 15 cm in diameter. The feature appears to be intact with only erosion stripping the matrix
around the spoil rock ring. The two tertiary/bifacial thinning flakes were found on the surface on the
eastern edge of the site boundary approximately 10 m from the ring midden. Both flakes appear to be
slightly rubified from heating and are made out of brown and gray chert (Appendix D: Photographs D-22
and D-23). No additional artifacts were observed.

6.3.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41UT152 is a prehistoric burned rock ring midden located in situ with associated FCR spoil and two
chert flakes. The site contains an intact subsurface component with datable organic material and may have

Conclusion and Recommendations

the potential to provide significant information important to prehistory under NRHP Criterion D, however
additional work is needed to assess the NRHP eligibility or SAL designation of the site. Therefore, the
site remains undetermined for the NRHP or as a SAL. Burns & McDonnell recommends avoidance of the
site to prevent any adverse effects to archeological deposits in association with the proposed Project in
lieu of further testing. Protective fencing and signage should be installed prior to clearing or construction
to prevent impacts to the site.

6.4

Site 41UT153

Site 41UT153 is an isolate burned rock feature located on King Mountain mesa approximately 4.3 miles
northwest from Five Mile Creek (Appendix A: Figure A-9; Appendix D: Photographs D-25 through D28). The site is situated within desert scrub brush and short, bunch grasses, with approximately 90
percent ground surface visibility due to sparse vegetation. The site has been previously disturbed by
heavy slope wash and eolian erosion.
Feature P1 measures approximately 80 cm in diameter and is partially exposed by erosion (Appendix D:
Photographs D-29 and D-30). The feature is comprised of approximately 50 FCR, half of which are
between 10 to 15 cm in diameter, and the remainder are under 10 cm. It appears to be resting in dense
caliche gravel close to indurated bedrock. Rocks appear to be in situ, but soil is now clast supported
matrix-filled with the Bk horizon in between. No organics were observed underneath the rocks that were
exposed. Rocks appear to be touching and overlapping one another further supporting in situ condition.
The area appears to be the remnants of the Bk horizons with exposed indurated limestone and caliche
gravels across the site. Because of the nature of the clast supported relict soil, or lack thereof, trowel tests
were not excavated within the feature. One shovel test, DR92, was excavated within 1 m of the exposed
feature and encountered bedrock at 15 cmbs. A gravel/dirt road is located immediately north of the site
and is currently used for access to a collocated transmission line. The isolated feature itself is eroding out
from under a rubber/black plastic pipe laid on surface. This likely caused increased erosion on the feature
further exposing it.
Nine shovel tests were excavated on site, none of which were positive for subsurface cultural material.
Shovel tests revealed 5-10 cmbs of silt loam soil matching the Tencee soil series description (NRCS
2019). No additional artifacts or features were observed at the site.

6.4.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41UT153 is an isolated burned rock feature partially exposed in the slope. The feature appears to be
in situ, however the surrounding matrix and any organics within have been eroded away. The site appears

Conclusion and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The background review and archeological survey of the approximately 5.25 mile (8.45 km)-long, 125-feet
(38.1 m)-wide proposed APE was completed between March 4 through 8, 2019. Four archeological sites
were recorded, sites 41UT150, 41UT151, 41UT152, and 41UT153. All four sites represent the remnants
of prehistoric campsites with remnant features or burned rock scatters. Based on the data recorded during
the survey, Burns & McDonnell recommends sites 41UT151 and 41UT153 do not contain the data
resources to warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion D or designation as a SAL and are recommended
ineligible. Site 41UT150 is also recommended as ineligible within the project right-of-way but extends to
the west and east and those portions are considered unevaluated. Site 41UT152 may have the potential to
provide significant information important to prehistory under NRHP Criterion D, however additional
work is needed to adequately assess the NRHP eligibility or SAL designation of the site. The site’s
eligibility for inclusion in NRHP or designation as SAL is undetermined at this time. Burns & McDonnell
recommends avoidance of the site to prevent any adverse effects to archeological deposits in association
with the proposed Project in lieu of further testing. Protective fencing and signage should be installed
prior to clearing or construction to prevent impacts to the site. No further consideration of impacts to
historic resources under Section 106 or the Antiquities Code of Texas is recommended in association with
proposed Project. In addition, if previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during
construction or significant changes to the Project plans are made, then additional assessments of impacts
to cultural resources would be required.
