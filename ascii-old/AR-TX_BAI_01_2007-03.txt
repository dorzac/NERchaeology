ABSTRACT
In February 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) conducted an
intensive archeological survey of approximately 1.21 miles of proposed and existing right-of-way (ROW)
for New Hope Road in the City of Cedar Park at the request of the City of Cedar. The intensive survey
was conducted prior to proposed roadway expansion and extension construction. Investigations surveyed
0.62 mile of existing and new planned ROW, as well as 0.59 mile of planned new ROW for the extension
of New Hope Road from the eastern edge of Gann Ranch Subdivision south to RM 1431. Investigations
discovered no cultural materials within the project area, no artifacts were collected, and curation was
unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations for the Proposed Expansion and Extension of New
Hope Road, City of Cedar Park, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing prior to proposed roadway expansion and extension construction
for New Hope Road in the City of Cedar Park, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas. Investigations
discovered no cultural resources.
The survey examined approximately 1.21 miles of existing and proposed right-of-way (ROW) for New
Hope Road. Approximately 0.62 mile of expansion construction would occur along the existing alignment
of New Hope Road between the eastern edge of the Gann Ranch Subdivision and Lakeline Boulevard.
This segment also contained proposed new ROW north of the existing ROW boundary. Investigations
also included 0.59 mile of planned new ROW extending from the eastern edge of Gann Ranch
Subdivision southward to RM 1431. The existing New Hope Road ROW is about 60 feet wide and
contains a two-lane undivided roadway with two 12-foot wide lanes. The proposed expansion and
extension would require an overall 120-foot wide ROW for, initially, an interim two-lane divided facility
with a raised median. However, the ROW will contain space for the future expansion to a four-lane
divided facility so that the 120-foot wide ROW would ultimately contain four 12-foot wide lanes, a raised
median, and two 10-foot wide sidewalks. Construction plans would accommodate the planned
construction of a future water transmission line within the New Hope Road ROW. This line will run on
the west side of the ROW in the proposed new location and on the south edge of the ROW within the
widened existing section.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in northwest Travis County and Southwest
Williamson County in the City of Cedar Park, Texas. The study area is located on the Leander, Texas,
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 17.6 acres.
DATE OF WORK: 16 February 2007.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4400
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.

COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing and proposed new ROWs without additional cultural resource investigations. The project area has
been extensively modified by buried utilities, drainage improvements, and roadway construction and/or
occupies upland landforms with thin clayey and gravelly to rocky clay soils that developed in situ. Given
such conditions, it is the opinion of Blanton & Associates that there is little to no potential for the project
area to contain intact buried cultural resources. If the planned construction should require additional work
space outside of the proposed new ROW, then additional cultural resource investigations in those areas
would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
In February 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) conducted an
intensive archeological survey of approximately 1.21 miles of proposed and existing right-of-way (ROW)
for New Hope Road in the City of Cedar Park, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas. The survey was
conducted prior to proposed roadway expansion and extension construction at the request of the City of
Cedar Park (Figure 1). Investigations involved the survey 0.62 mile of existing and proposed ROW in the
northern portion of the project area between the eastern edge of the Gann Ranch Subdivision and Lakeline
Boulevard. The southern part of the project contains 0.59 mile of planned new ROW location for the
proposed southern extension of New Hope Road and begins at the eastern edge of Gann Ranch
Subdivision and trends south-southwest to the projectâs southern terminus at RM 1431.
The existing New Hope Road ROW is about 60 feet wide and contains a two-lane undivided roadway
with two 12-foot wide lanes. The proposed expansion and extension would require an overall 120-foot
wide ROW corridor for, initially, an interim two-lane divided facility with a raised median. However, the
ROW will contain space for the future expansion to a four-lane divided facility so that the 120-foot wide
ROW would ultimately contain four 12-foot wide lanes, a raised median, and two 10-foot wide sidewalks.
The expansion of the existing ROW in the northern part of the project area would occur north of the
existing ROW boundary. Construction plans were designed to also accommodate the planned
construction of a future water transmission line within the ROW, which would run on the west side of the
ROW in the proposed new location and on the south edge of the ROW within the widened northern
section.
As the proposed construction would occur on property owned by a political subdivision of the State of
Texas, the City of Cedar Park, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas,
now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the
necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and
requires that any state agency must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions
that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of
Archeology administers the codeâs provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas
Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. The project was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4400 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all cultural resources discovered within the project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for formal SAL
designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make recommendations for future
cultural resource management options such as avoidance and preservation or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is located on the Edwards Plateau in southwest Williamson County and northwest Travis
County. This part of the plateau consists of a massive uplift of Cretaceous age marine limestone, marl,
and dolomite stone that rises approximately 2,000 feet above sea level (Spearing 1994). Along the
southeastern margins of the plateau is the Balcones escarpment, âa fault-line scarp caused by faster
erosion of the softer rocks which lie to the south and east of theâ¦faultâ (Spearing 1994:114). In general,
the western part of the Edwards Plateau is a high and relatively flat uplift, while the eastern Hill Country
part (i.e. the Austin and Cedar Park areas) has been deeply eroded, creating a more rolling topography
(Spearing 1994).
GEOLOGY
Geology of the project area consists of the Lower Cretaceous-aged Fredericksburg Group, which contains
a number of constituent limestone and marl formations. The majority of the study area consists of
Comanche Peak Limestone, a fine to very fine, nodular, and light gray formation roughly 80 feet thick.
Small Keys Valley Marl is also mapped within the study area. This formation is soft, white marl that
contains numerous marine fossils, such as Exogyra texana (Barnes 1974). Topographically, the project
area is nearly level to undulating, with the southern planned extension sloping gently to the southsouthwest.
SOILS
Soils in the project area belong to the Denton-Eckhart-Doss association, which consists of calcareous
clayey, cobbly, and stony upland soils. Constituent soils from this association in the Williamson County
part of the project area include Crawford clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes,
Denton silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Eckhart cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes, Fairlie clay 1 to 2
percent slopes, and Georgetown clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. Only very small areas of Denton silty
clay, Fairlie clay, and Georgetown loam are located within the project area. The dominant soils include
Crawford clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes, and Eckhart cobbly clay, 1 to 8
percent slopes. These are upland soils that formed in situ from clayey sediments or from limy earth
interbedded with weakly cemented limestone or from clayey material overlying indurated limestone
(Werchan and Coker 1983) and have, therefore, little to no potential for containing intact buried cultural
deposits.
In Travis County, the proposed ROW crosses small areas of Crawford clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes, Purves
silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes, and Tarrant soils, rolling with 5 to 12 percent slopes. In areas of Tarrant
soils (rolling), between 25 and 85 percent of the ground surface is covered in large limestone rocks. These
are upland soils that formed in situ from interbedded limestone (Werchan et al. 1974) and have little to no
potential for containing intact buried cultural deposits.

VEGETATION
The project area is located in the Balconian biotic province (Blair 1950) atop an upland ridge primarily
occupied by scattered Plateau live oak (Quercus virginiana var. fusiformis) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei). Common shrubs include flame-leaf sumac (Rhus copallina), agarito (Berberis trifoliata), Texas
persimmon (Diospyros texana), and pricklypear (Opuntia sp.). Dominant herbaceous species include
common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), King Ranch
bluestem (B. ischaemum), and fall witchgrass (Digitaria cognata). In the approximate center of the
project area is occupied by a small stand of woodlands dominated by Plateau live oak and Ashe juniper.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of data available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and on the THCâs
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted to determine the presence of any previously
recorded sites or previous project areas within or adjacent to the current study area. The review indicated
that there are no previously recorded archeological sites within the proposed ROW, but there are a
number of previously recorded archeological sites and project areas near the study area.
The earliest recorded site near the current study area is 41TV81, a prehistoric open camp with five burned
rock middens sitting on a hill above a spring along Lime Creek. The site is located approximately 1,350
meters southeast of the southern terminus of the project area at RM 1431 and was recorded in 1959 by
avocational archeologist J. Greer. In 1971, prehistoric site 41TV124 was recorded about 200 meters
southeast of the current project areaâs southern terminus on RM 1431. The site is located on the canyon
rim at the head of an unnamed tributary of Lime Creek. This site was recorded by avocational
archeologist P. W. Millican.
In 1982 the Texas Water Development Board, on behalf of the EPA, conducted a large area survey
approximately 1,200 meters northeast of the northern end of the study area and recorded 41WM279, Long
site. This site is a multicomponent prehistoric and historic site roughly 100 acres in size and containing
two standing ranch structures and a broad prehistoric component consisting of a surface and shallow
subsurface scatter of chipped stone debitage and burned limestone rock. The City of Leander sponsored a
cultural resources survey of 150+ acres of land north of, and adjacent to, the existing section of New
Hope Road in 1997. The previous project area is at the northern end of the present study area and no sites
were recorded during those investigations.
In 2002, a survey was conducted prior to proposed improvements to the City of Cedar Parkâs RM 1431
wastewater system. The project area paralleled parts of RM 1431 at the southern end of the New Hope
Road project area before turning south. During those investigations, previous recorded site 41TV124 was
reassessed and one new historic site (41TV19915) was discovered. Site 41TV1995 was described as a
light surface scatter of circa AD 1890 to 1970 glass, metal, ceramic, wood and plastic. The site probably
represents the remains of a dump or a residential site that could be associated with a nearby quarry. Sites
41TV124 or 41TV1995 were not recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL
designation (Hubbard 2002).
The City of Cedar Park sponsored a cultural resources survey in 2003 prior to the construction of an
elevated water storage tank and two waterline easements on the north side of the existing New Hope Road
approximately 1,000 meters east of the northern end of the current project area. Investigations found no
archeological sites or historic structures within the study area. Additionally, the rocky clay soils of the
area have little potential to contain buried, intact cultural deposits (Brownlow 2003).
In 2005, the Leander Independent School District required an archeological survey of 16 acres of land
prior to the planned construction of a new elementary school (no. 17). The survey found no cultural
resources (Russell 2005). The same year, prehistoric site 41TV2157 was recorded near the intersection of
RM 1431and HUR Industrial Boulevard approximately 400 meters southwest of the southern end of the

present study area. Site 41TV2157 is comprised of a burned rock midden and an associated lithic scatter
at the head of an unnamed tributary of Lime Creek. This site is roughly 400 meters west of 41TV124. The
midden extends for 40 meters following the rim of the steep canyon of Lime Creek. The upper surface of
the midden is complex with mounded areas and depressions. A small rock shelter with an associated
burned rock midden is located down slope below the 40-meter long midden.

METHODS
Blanton & Associates conducted an intensive pedestrian archeological survey with surface and subsurface
investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of
any cultural resources discovered within the proposed project area. The survey adhered to THC survey
standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the Secretary
of the Interiorâs Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983). The survey was designed and executed in
accordance with the Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and
TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian examination of the ground surface within the
existing and new proposed ROW. The THCâs survey standards for linear project areas less than 200 acres
in size require that surface surveys be augmented by systematic shovel testing in locations where surface
visibility falls below 30 percent. However, the soils in the study area are upland soils that developed in
situ and are not conducive for containing buried intact cultural deposits. Additionally, the existing New
Hope Road ROW area has experienced extensive subsurface disturbances (i.e., dense buried utilities,
drainage improvements, and roadway construction and maintenance) that have resulted in a lack of intact
sediments within the APE. Because of the above conditions, judgmental shovel testing was employed
throughout the project area. The proposed new and existing ROW crosses no drainages so backhoe
trenching was not warranted.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in diameter and excavated with a standard square head shovel to a
depth of 100 centimeters or until soil characteristics or bedrock prohibited further excavation. Shovel tests
were excavated in 20-centimeter levels and all removed soil was screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh to
ensure artifact recovery. All shovel test locations were plotted with hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receivers and documented on an appropriate Blanton & Associates shovel test form. The field
investigations were thoroughly photo-documented with digital cameras.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Surface and subsurface disturbances from erosion, urban development, buried and overhead utilities,
drainage improvement, and highway construction has removed or thoroughly disturbed all of the soils
within the New Hope Road project area (Figure 2). The northern 0.62 mile part of the study is a
developed residential area with curb, gutters, and sidewalks. The southern 0.59-mile long new location
ROW traverses undeveloped pasture and woodland of juniper and live oak.
PROPOSED EXTENSION ROW
The southern end of the study area begins at RM 1431 and extends 0.59 mile north to the existing New
Hope Road ROW in the Gann Ranch neighborhood (see Figure 2). In the northern end of this section is a
juniper and live oak woodlands, while to the south is open pasture (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Because of no
right-of-entry (ROE), an approximately 60-foot wide by 300-foot long area of the ROW in this section
could not be investigated.
Surface investigations along the proposed new ROW revealed exposed limestone bedrock, as well as
bedrock gravels and cobbles, amidst a cover of various grasses where ground surface visibility varied
from 25 percent to greater than 50 percent (Figure 5). Inspection along the western edge of the property
with no ROE from the immediately adjacent, accessible ROW observed no standing structures or
structural debris. The same inspection found no prehistoric materials on the stony ground surface in those
areas visible along the property boundary. In the central portion of this section of the project is a complex
of modern structures and corrals within 200 feet or less of the eastern edge of the proposed ROW
(Figure 6). Surface investigations found no prehistoric or historic cultural materials within the APE or on
adjacent private property that could be inspected from the proposed ROW.
Subsurface investigations in the southern study area consisted of the excavation of 14 shovel tests (STs)
to prospect for buried cultural deposits in areas with less than 30 percent ground surface visibility
(Appendix). Subsurface tests revealed very dense, compacted, gravely to rocky, and moist to hard very
dark brown to black clay. No archeological deposits were discovered in any shovel tests. Shovel tests
extended no deeper than 50 centimeters below ground surface because deeper tests were considered
unnecessary in the relatively thin and rocky upland clays.
Surface and subsurface investigations in this part of the project area discovered no prehistoric or historic
cultural resources, only thin stony and eroded upland clay overlying limestone bedrock. Given these
conditions, it is unlikely that any intact cultural resources will be impacted within the APE, including the
inaccessible property, by the construction of the proposed New Hope Roads extension.
EXISTING AND PROPOSED EXPANSION ROW
The northern part of the study extends from Lakeline Boulevard to the western end of the existing New
Hope Road at the Gann Ranch subdivision (Figure 7; Figure 8; see Figure 2). Because of no ROE, an

approximately 60-foot wide by 600-foot long area of planned expansion ROW on private property in this
section could not be investigated (Figure 9).
Surface investigations in the northern study area revealed that the existing ROW has been significantly
impacted horizontally and vertically from residential and commercial development, buried and overhead
utilities, and roadway construction (Figure 10 and Figure 11). The entire southern half of the existing
ROW in this section consists of sidewalks and utility easements and, therefore, possesses no intact
sediments (Figure 12). The northern part of the existing expansion ROW in this area has a lower density
of buried utilities than the south side. The property with no ROE was easily inspected from the fence line
separating the tract from the existing ROW, as the area was clear of brush and ground surface visibility
was at least 50 percent (see Figure 9). No standing structures or structural debris were observed on the
inaccessible tract.
Subsurface investigations in the proposed expansion ROW consisted of the excavation of STs 15â19 (see
Appendix). Given the lack of intact sediments south of the roadway, shovel testing was limited to the
north side of New Hope Road where the planned expansion ROW was located. Subsurface tests revealed
shallow very dense, compacted, gravely to rocky, and moist to hard very dark brown to black clay
overlying limestone bedrock gravels and/or cobbles. No archeological deposits were discovered in any
shovel tests. Although the property with no ROE could not be accessed, given the thin stony soils of the
project area and the results of shovel testing across the study area, there is little potential for this property
to contain buried intact prehistoric deposits.
Surface and subsurface investigations in this part of the project area discovered no prehistoric or historic
cultural resources, only thin stony and eroded upland clay overlying limestone bedrock. Given these
conditions, it is unlikely that any intact cultural resources will be impacted within the APE, including the
inaccessible property, by the construction of the proposed New Hope Road expansion.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts along the existing and proposed ROW for New Hope Road found
no cultural resources. Surface and subsurface investigations revealed that the proposed 0.59 mile planned
southern extension of New Hope Road contains eroded thin, gravelly, and stony upland clay soils that
developed in situ. The 0.62 mile of existing ROW in the northern part of the project area has been
extensively disturbed by urban development, buried and overhead utilities, drainage improvements, and
roadway construction. Additionally, the planned ROW north of New Hope Road also has thin gravelly to
rocky upland clay soils that developed in situ.
Given the negative results of the survey and the eroded clay soils of the project area, it is the opinion of
Blanton & Associates that there is little to no potential for the study area, including the two properties that
could only be inspected from the adjacent ROW because of no ROE, to contain intact buried prehistoric
deposits or intact historic resources. Blanton & Associates recommends therefore that, as no prehistoric or
historic cultural resources that could contribute new or important information to our understanding of
regional or local prehistory and history would be impacted by the proposed project, construction should
be allowed to proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
If it is determined that the construction requires impacts to occur outside the existing and proposed new
ROW locations, then further cultural resource investigations would be necessary in those areas before
construction occurs. If evidence of archeological resources is identified during construction, work in the
immediate area should cease until the THC is contacted and accidental discovery procedures can be
implemented.
