ABSTRACT
This multivolume report contains the substantive findings and management
recommendations of three cultural resource inventories conducted by Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for the Property Inventory Project (PIP),
Project Blue Sky, and Trigg Lake Access Road projects located within the
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas and Tarrant Counties,
Texas. As each project transpired on the DFW property, approval from the Federal
Aviation Administration was required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to
reflect the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the
projects subsequently required compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the projects
were subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The results of the three projects, conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #7373,
were documented within seven interim reports. Each interim report has been
included as a separate volume within this report. The interim reports are organized
in order of when field investigations occurred from August 2015 to November
2017. The entirety of the projects included 2,705 acres of the DFW property. The
individual interim reports contained within this document received formal review
from the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The THC comments issued for each
interim report are included in Volume VIII. Records collected for each report will
be curated temporarily at IES and permanently curated at Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
The goal of the surveys was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work conformed
to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.
Through the inventories, six archeological sites were revisited, 16 new
archeological sites recorded, and three historic-period cemeteries were assessed.
Of the 22 archeological sites encountered by IES investigators, 17 historical (H),
two prehistoric (P), and three multiple component (M) sites were evaluated (see
following page for listing of all sites). Through subsequent analysis, 21 sites were
determined to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL and one was of
undetermined status. Investigations surrounding three cemeteries did not encounter
any evidence of unmarked graves within the APE and indicate the cemeteries will
be avoided by the undertaking. No further work warranted at this time.
However, if during construction any cultural resources (other than those detailed
within this report) or evidence of unmarked graves are unearthed, the operators
should cease work immediately in that area. The project cultural resources
consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC
prior to resuming construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations
of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located within the Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. As the
project will occur on the DFW property, approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect
the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will
subsequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In
addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the project will
be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The PIP is designed to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial
development. The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW
Commercial Development Department and subsequently organized into four
separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4). While the survey for all four tranches
was conducted under a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that
each tranche be discussed within a separate report deliverable. This report
documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 1.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work conformed
to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone and
Joshua Hamilton between the 4th and 6th of August, 2015. Prior to IESâs pedestrian
survey, several areas along Valley View Lane and West Walnut Hill Lane, within
the eastern portion of the Tranche 1, were identified as potentially containing
historic-period cultural features and/or deposits. During the IES survey, six
archeological sites (41DL521, 41DL522, 41DL523, 41DL524, 41DL525, and
41DL526) were documented within the APE. In addition, the boundaries of
Harrington Family Cemetery were assessed to determine the potential for unmarked
graves near the APE. Through the subsequent analysis, sites 41DL523, 41DL524,
41DL525, and 41DL526 were determined to be ineligible for listing on the NRHP
or as a SAL. Two sites, 41DL521 and 41DL522, were determined to be ineligible
within the project right-of-way with the remaining portions of these sites being
undetermined. No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural resources,
other than those documented within this report, are unearthed during construction,
the operators should stop construction activities in those areas, and immediately
contact the project environmental representative to initiate coordination with the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of Potential
Effects (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and
recommendations. This report documents the cultural resources survey necessary to satisfy the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As requested by the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport, Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located
on the DFW property in Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. Compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) and the NHPA are required for the project as the DFW is seeking approval from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP), which is a federal action.
In addition, as the DFW is an entity of the state, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the proposed project is to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development.
The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development Department and
subsequently organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4) (Figure 1.1). Each tranche
was comprised of a variable amount of smaller âareas,â which were in turn comprised of smaller âtracts.â
Within the four tranches, there were a total of 11 areas and 49 tracts. The tranches are primarily located
within the eastern half of the DFW with approximately 53 percent located in Dallas County, 40 percent in
Tarrant County, and 7 percent in both counties. While the survey for all four tranches was conducted under
a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that each tranche be discussed within a separate
report deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 1. The
remaining tranches will be discussed within subsequent reports. The APE is plotted on the Euless and
Grapevine 7.5 Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets and recent aerial
photographs (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Archeological Resources
Tranche 1 contained three areas comprised of 13 tracts, which total 1,219.4 acres, and is referred to as the
APE for this project. Tranche 1 was located within the southern and northwestern portions of the DFW and
contained seven tracts in Dallas, three tracts in Tarrant County, and three straddling the Dallas/Tarrant
county line. These areas and tracts are summarized in Table 1.1.
Although exact project design details for each tract are still in the early stages of planning, ground disturbing
activities will be typical of those required for box-style warehouse and mixed use commercial development.
Exact depth of ground disturbing activities has not yet been determined; however, subsurface investigations
within APE were assessed to culturally sterile soil.
Historic-Period Resources
While an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with Section 106; an assessment of indirect effects would be required per the NHPA
Section 106 regulations. Thus, any standing structure of historic age, encountered within the footprint of
proposed construction, or within 300 feet (approximately 100 meters) of the project area, will be
photographed and assessed for their potential eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas and Tarrant Counties are in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 42.01 inches. About
half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of
the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008; Brooks et. al 1964).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is occasionally
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries for surrounding creeks. The periphery of the DFWâs
western, southern, and eastern limits contain more dramatic topography with more incised drainages and
named creeks. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the low-lying Bear Creek valley floor
correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay rich Blackland Prairie soils to the more erosive, sandy
soils of the Cross Timbers ecological regions.
The topography of Tranche 1 is similar to the overall topographic pattern of the DFW. Approximately 75
percent of the project area is located within the rolling upland setting with the remaining 25 percent located
within the more steeply sloped margins of the Big Bear Creek valley floor. Table 2.1 contains a specific
topographic description of each tract within Tranche 1.
Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
Tranche 1 was located along the western periphery of the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion. The
southernmost portion of the APE contained a small sliver of the Big Bear Creek valley floor. Big Bear
Creek flows from the northwest to the southeast through the western portion of the DFW. The current creek
channel was located adjacent to the Tract 1A1; however, the original natural channel cut through the
southwestern portion of the tract. The creek is a recognized natural division of the Northern Blackland
Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers regions (McGowen et al. 1984). Variation of soil and vegetation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999).
Northern Blackland Prairie
The northern and eastern portions of the APE were located within the Northern Blackland Prairie, which is
characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick, plastic clay soils typical of the Houston
Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils,
which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within the Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987).
This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised of sedimentary rock consisting of shale,
siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic clay (Coffee 1980, McGowen et al. 1987,
USGS 2015).
Eastern Cross Timbers
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987.) The countless hills were once heavily wooded by dense stands of oak, walnut,
blackjack, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the region
as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban expansion,
agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become highly fragmented
and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains today (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
[TPWD] 2015). The APE is underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation (Figure 2.1). The
Volume I: Property Inventory Project âTranche 1
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.033
Page 15

Woodbine underlies the Eagle Ford Formation and the strata dates back to the Late Cretaceous in the Upper
Cenomanian stage (Winton 1925). The Woodbine is primarily composed of sandstone, but also contains a
small percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay.

The southernmost portion of the APE contains the northernmost extent of Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt)
within the Big Bear Creek valley. These terraces were formed adjacent to the Trinity River and its
tributaries during the Pleistocene period and are comprised of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The deposits can
contain point bars, cutbanks, and oxbows with variations in stream bed activity. As a result, soil profiles
in terrace deposits may vary greatly over relatively short distances (Scoggins 2004).
Soils Description
According to soil surveys of Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the APE contained 25 soil series (USDA 2015)
(Figure 2.2). Table 2.2 provides a brief description of the 25 soils and their percentages within the APE.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicated that the entirety
of Tract 1A1 was previously surveyed for cultural resources. The survey was conducted by AR Consultants,
Inc. (ARC) between April 2007 to February 2008 under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4491 (TASA 2015).
Other than this survey, the TASA archives indicated four additional archeological surveys have been
conducted within one-mile of the APE (Figure 3.1). These surveys are summarized in Table 3.1.

The TASA records also indicated that a historic-aged cemetery was located adjacent to the APE. Harrington
Family Cemetery, also known as Estelle Cemetery, was situated 70 feet from the western boundary of Tract
1B1. The cemetery extended approximately 120 feet by 100 feet along a north/south by east/west
orientation. According to records made by the THC in 2004, the cemetery contains six gravestones, the
earliest dating to 1892; however, there is evidence of multiple unmarked graves within the fenced
perimeters. THC investigators also noted the cemetery had been vandalized and was missing features such
as a gate to the fenced enclosure.

3.2 Previously Recorded Sites within Vicinity
A file search within the TASA identified that there are eight previously recorded archeological sites,
National Register Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA
2015). These sites were 41DL460, 41DL461, 41DL462, 41DL463, 41DL464, 41DL465, 41DL466, and
41DL467 and are summarized in Table 3.2. According to the TASA records, there were five recorded sites
within one-mile (~1600 meters) of the APE. These sites were 41DL492, 41TR241, 41TR264, 41TR273,
41TR274, and 41TR275 and are summarized in Table 3.3.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the soil surveys of
Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic
map, the NRCS digital soil database for Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the National Archives and Records
Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the
Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, the Fort Worth District Potential Archeological
Liability Map (FT-PALM), and both past and current aerial photography.
Archeological Resources
In 2007 and 2008, AR Consultants conducted intensive pedestrian surveys of 1,210 acres on the DFW
International Airport property under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4491 and published their results in the
report An Archeological Survey for Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas
and Tarrant Counties, Texas.
According to the AR Consultants study, the Blackland Prairie Uplands, Zone 1, was located within the
majority of the APE (Figure 3.2). Zone 1 consists of mostly level clay or clay loam soils over a thin layer
of limestone bedrock. Water permeates very slowly to the water table causing slow surface runoff and high
shrink and swell potential. This setting has a low biotic diversity and is dominated by short grasses. Due
to the limited resources available within the area, it has a low probability for containing prehistoric sites.
Throughout the last century, this zone was primarily used for agricultural and ranching activities. Due to
the large-scale construction of the DFW during the late 1960s, it is unlikely to contain any intact historical
sites (Shelton et al. 2008).
A small percent of the APE was located within the Eastern Cross Timbers (Zone 2) environmental setting
nearest to Big Bear Creek. Zone 2 is typified by a wide range of well-drained soil types ranging from
alluvial clays to sandy loams located on uplands, ridges, terraces, tributary streams, and valleys.
Accordingly, these soils support a wide range of vegetation and, during the prehistoric period, dense stands
of old growth trees. The upland soils are moderately well suited for cropland, pastureland, or urban
development and the area has been utilized for agricultural purposes since early historic settlement. Thus,
Zone 2 is considered to have a high potential for containing both prehistoric and historic-aged sites (Shelton
et al. 2008).

Historic-Period Resources
Historical aerial photographs and topographic maps illustrate that the land within the APE was used as
agricultural land and/or pastureland as early as 1956. Historical aerial photographs dating to the mid-1950s
indicated that 12 farmsteads with their associated outlying structures and three structures were present
within the current APE. Based on images observed on historicaerials.com, it appears that a majority of the
remaining structures were removed between 1972 and 1979. Since the early 1970s, the APE has remained
undeveloped and become overgrown by secondary growth. One historic-aged cemetery was documented
in close proximity to the APE. As such, the potential for encountering historic-period resources remained
moderately high within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for PIP Tranche 1 of the PIP was conducted between the 4th and 6th of August
2015. The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to
field work, the IES staff conducted an archeological and historical records search to determine what cultural
resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600 m) radius of the APE. This
information was detailed previously. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils
data, as well as, historical and modern topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Pedestrian Survey
The entirety of the APE (that had not been previously surveyed) was located within the Zone 1 setting,
which was determined by ARC as having a low potential for containing significant prehistoric and historicaged archeological sites. To verify this, a site-specific investigation that targeted the locations of known
historic-aged structures and cemeteries was developed. The DFW has a large amount of historical
information pertaining to the land use prior to the DFW construction. During the background research prior
to survey, a variety of these resources were referenced to determine, which areas would be investigated.
Each structure identified within georeferenced historical maps and data was buffered to include a one-acre
area surrounding each identified feature. Buffered areas did not denote the limits of a given survey, but
were expanded or contracted depending on field observations. Each buffered area was compared with
current land use, past disturbance, and previous survey limits to identify high probability areas (HPA). All
selected HPAs were located within areas containing some type of tree canopy that prevented the
determination of any remaining standing structures. Areas containing the historical location of a standing
structure, areas located within settings that allowed for viewing the ground (i.e. open field setting), or areas
displaying high levels of disturbance were removed from the HPA list and not subjected to an intensive
level survey. The HPAs identified for survey are represented within Figure 4.1. All remaining portions of
the APE outside the HPAs were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological
deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware
cloth to test for the presence of buried cultural material. If the clay content was high and could not be
efficiently screened, material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition,
the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and
plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. Although the entire APE is comprised of 1219.4 acres, due to
aforementioned reasons, acreage for the HPAs was much lower, approximately 45 acres. CTA survey
standards recommend that an APE with an area of 45 acres (18.2 ha), displaying little to no disturbance,
should have approximately 23 shovel tests (one shovel test per two acres) excavated during the pedestrian
survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from this amount due to the level of disturbance observed
during the pedestrian survey. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data were
geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS unit.

4.3 Site Recording
When applicable, archeological sites were evaluated through no fewer than six shovel tests (when
topography allows or site warrants such investigation) to assess their horizontal extent and characterize

depth of archeological deposits. Negative shovel tests, the distribution of surficial artifacts/features,
topography, and/or the APE extent delineated the boundaries of each site. For the purposes of this survey,
an archeological site was defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 10 m radius, a cultural feature
observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, a positive shovel test containing two or more
subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newlydocumented sites were assigned a temporary field number and were recorded on State of Texas
Archeological Site Data forms.

4.4 Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site and each site was plotted on the
appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map. The data from any encountered site was recorded in the
field and was processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site significance and potential
eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. When applicable, a variety of data was used to assess site
significance including date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature
preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance. Completed site forms were submitted to
TARL.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant for
one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria pertain
to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B) that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
In general, cultural resources that could be eligible for listing are greater than 50 years in age. Through the
background research, it was determined that the most likely Criteria a property within the APE would be
eligible for listing under would be Criterion A, B, or C.

4.5 Archival Research
A deed search was conducted for sites that contained evidence that dated to the historic-period. The purpose
was to identify historically notable persons possibly associated with the site. Initial research was carried
out by examining the primary sources in the deed and land title records in the documents provided by the
DFW and previous archeological reports. Further research was conducted within the Dallas County Clerkâs
Rapid Online Access Method (ROAM) and at the Tarrant County Clerkâs office. The identified persons
also researched for historic significance in The Handbook of Texas Online and within various publications.

4.6 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the
IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs will be organized and
catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
5.1 Passport Park (Area 1A)
Overview
Area 1A was comprised of a single 694.5-acre tract (Tract 1A1) that was bounded by South Rental Car
Drive to the north, Valley View Lane to the east, West Airport Freeway to the south, and International
Parkway to the west. Tract 1A1 was bisected by the Dallas/Tarrant county line with the majority of the
tract located within Dallas County. Although the tract was included as part of the Tranche 1 APE, the
entirety of the tract was surveyed by ARC in 2008. Tract 1A1 was the southernmost area within Tranche
1 and according to the ARC survey contained both Zone 2 and Zone 1 environmental settings. Zone 2 was
primarily located within the southwestern portion of the tract within the sloping valley walls and the lower
lying terraces of Big Bear Creek.
Field Observations
No field investigations were conducted by IES within Tract 1A1 for the PIP survey.
Encountered Cultural Resources
ARC recorded eight historic-aged archeological sites (41DL460, 41DL461, 41DL462, 41DL463,
41DL464, 41DL465, 41DL466, and 41DL467) within the approximate 380 acres within Tract 1A1âs Zone
1 setting. During the survey, no standing structures were encountered. The boundaries of all archeological
sites encountered were verified through shovel testing. Overall, very little physical evidence remained
within the sites and all were dated to the mid-20th century. These sites are summarized previously within
Table 3.2. As a result of the 2008 survey, ARC determined that Zone 1 contains a negligible potential for
intact deposits. The THC concurred with ARCâs determination that all eight sites were ineligible for listing
on the NRHP or SAL designation.

5.2 Walnut Hill (Area 1B)
Overview
Area 1B consisted of nine tracts (Tracts 1B1 to 1B9) that totaled 474.4 acres. The nine tracts were bounded
by International Parkway to the west, West Walnut Hill Lane to the north, Valley View Lane to the east,
and Rental Car Drive to the south. All tracts are entirely within Dallas County, except for Tracts 1B6 and
1B7, which are bisected by the Dallas/Tarrant county line. Overall, tracts within Area 1B are relatively
featureless. However, portions of Tracts 1B1, 1B2, 1B3, 1B5, 1B8, and 1B9 were located near the
headwaters of Estelle Creek and an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek.
Field Observations
Tracts within Area 1B were primarily comprised of open grass fields with isolated dense stands of trees.
The tree clusters were typically centered around the remains of historic-aged debris or frequently inundated
lower-lying areas. The entirety of Area 1B was located within environmental Zone 1 and displayed high
amounts of past ground disturbance. The most widespread disturbances observed were located within
Tracts 1B7 and 1B8 as these tracts have been impacted by construction, drainage improvement, or were
adjacent to commercial development. The most obvious disturbance within the remaining tracts was the
demolition and removal of the residential buildings and farmsteads that were present prior to the DFW
acquisition.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, seven HPAs were developed within Area 1B. Six out of
the seven HPAs identified at the IES office were field verified as containing some evidence of historicperiod utilization. The HPA survey totaled 45 acres and was inventoried using transect survey and sampled

through the excavation of 50 shovel tests. Six archeological sites (41DL521, 41DL522, 41DL523,
41DL524, 41DL525, and 41DL526) were encountered and recorded during the HPA survey (Appendix
C). The HPAs and their findings are summarized in Table 5.1. Background research determined that
Tracts 1B4, 1B5, 1B7, and 1B8 contained no apparent evidence of historic-period occupation and were
located within a setting that could be visually inspected through aerial photography and/or displayed high
amounts of ground disturbance. Although these areas were not intensively surveyed, the areas were
photographed and documented (Appendix A, Photographs 1 to 7).

Encountered Cultural Resources
41DL521
Site 41DL521 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 345 feet by 825 feet
along the historical location of Estelle Road. The site was located within a gently sloping setting within
the headwaters of Estelle Creek. Modern roads bound the site to the east and west, while the northern extent
of the site paralleled a modern fence line. The southern and eastern extent of the site was established by
features and artifact distributions (Figure 5.1) (Appendix A, Photographs 8 and 9). Based on historical
aerial photographs and field observations it was determined that the site likely extended an additional 300
feet by 300 feet to the west of the APE. The site likely pertained to a mixture of historical activities
including an early 19th century farmstead and schoolhouse.
Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs, dating to as early as 1942, illustrated the site was located between a farmstead
to the east and a schoolhouse to the west. The land within the site was clear-cut between 1958 and 1963
and again in the 1980s. Since then, the site has become overgrown by early successional vegetation.
Several push-piles and linear ditches were observed within the site.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Eight shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation. Three shovel tests were positive and yielded
three glass fragments from shovel test JH24, one glass fragment from JH25, and one ferrous object from
KS20 (Table 5.2). The soils were characterized by gravelly clay loam soils that did not exceed past 30
cmbs. A compact, culturally sterile clay layer restricted excavation below 30 cm.

A low to moderate density of surficial artifacts consisting of tin cans, brick and brick fragments, metal
fragments, glass bottles and shards, metal pails, and asphalt conglomerates was distributed across the
majority of the site (Appendix A, Photographs 10 to 12). Several diagnostic artifacts were observed
during the delineation, which included medicine bottles and a brick fragment. A Palmer brick fragment
was observed within the site and was made by the Palmer Pressed Brick Works, which was operating from
1902 to 1929 in Palmer, Texas (Graves 2012). The diagnostic artifacts are summarized in Table 5.3. The
majority of surficial artifacts within 41DL521 were observed within the APE as ground visibility remained
moderately high and many of the artifacts outside the APE had been removed during ground maintenance
of the DFWâs Estelle School Preservation Site (ESPS).

Features
Five features were identified within the site. Features 1, 2, and 3 were located outside the APE, but were
recorded due to their location directly adjacent to the APE and association with the two features encountered
within the APE.
Feature 1 was located within the ESPS and consisted of a rectangular, concrete foundation that was
approximately 60 feet by 30 feet (Appendix A, Photograph 13). Through research and aerial photography
interpretation, it was determined that the foundation pertained to the Estelle schoolhouse. The
schoolhouseâs entrance was located on the south side of the feature and denoted by an approximate 10-foot
wide concrete slab. The foundation outlined two large rooms separated by an approximately 10-foot wide
by 30-foot long hallway (Appendix A, Photographs 14 and 15). The school was constructed in 1916 or
1917 and was reported to have been constructed from varying shades of red bricks. Each classroom was
25 feet by 30 feet in dimension and contained a stove and a teacherâs desk.
Feature 2 was located 40 feet south of Feature 1 and consisted of four metal braces and a one concrete
foundation that was one square foot in size and likely supported a metal pole. The braces were positioned
in a square pattern with the concrete foundation approximately ten feet to the north (Appendix A,
Photograph 16). Based on historical documents, this feature likely represented the base of the
schoolhouseâs overhead water storage tank.

Feature 3 was located five feet east of Feature 2 and consisted of a flat cement slab that extended
approximately 15 feet by 10 feet (Appendix A, Photograph 17). The feature was non-descript in nature
and typical for construction during that time period. One inscription within the concrete reads âTexas
1933.â
Feature 4 consisted of a west to east oriented abandoned road that formed the siteâs northern boundary. The
abandoned road grade was located approximately 15 feet south of the maintained field. The road grade was
approximately 15 feet wide and was elevated approximately one-foot above the ground surface. Several
portions along the feature contained exposed asphalt (Appendix A, Photograph 18).
Feature 5 pertained to an old fence line that was comprised of several wooden posts with portions of fence
wire still attached and several concrete foundations. The fence posts and foundations were evenly spaced
and had likely been disturbed during the demolition of the schoolhouse and its associated structures.
Archival Research
Site 41DL521 was located within the Swing & Laws Survey, patented on 07 January 1862. The oldest deed
records observed during the project, pertaining to the siteâs location, detailed the transfer of ownership
through a donation of an 80 yard by 80 yard section of land from B. M. Harrington to trustees R.E. Morrow,
W. Lucas, and B.M. Harrington on 27 October 1883 for the establishment of the Estelle Masonic Lodge
(ROAM Volume 64/Pages 14 and 15). An additional section of land was donated on 23 August 1916 when
Susanna L. Harrington donated 510 yards by 262.23 yards to Dallas County for the construction of a
schoolhouse (ROAM Volume 685/Page 357-358).
In 2002, Edgar Brown, in cooperation with Morris Taylor and Marion Altom, two residents of Estelle from
1925 to 1940, came together and donated archival and recollected information of their time spent in Estelle,
Texas. As a result, maps of the town, the school ground, and the outside and inside of the school buildings
and its outlying structures were recreated (Appendix D).
Recreated documents from Brown et al. (2002) provide details of many of the structures that were in use
during the early 20th century. The northwesternmost structure on the 1942 aerial photograph corresponds
in location and style to the teacherâs house. The Masonic Lodge was a two-story building located southeast
of the teacherâs house and was constructed in 1884. The first floor was used as a schoolhouse and the
second floor hosted the Masonic meetings. The Masonic Lodge burned to the ground November 14, 1964
due to an unknown cause (Brown et al. 2002).
The two-story Masonic Lodge housed the Estelle school until 1916 or 1917, when a two-story brick
schoolhouse was constructed a few hundred feet to the east. According to firsthand accounts, the brick
schoolhouse contained two rooms; one was used for kindergarten through third, while the other was for
grades fourth through seventh. The studentâs desks were arranged in rows of five with six or seven seats
in each row. There was a fire escape located in the northeast portion of the structure. The stairs led to the
second floor, which was utilized for public functions. The second floor was outfitted with a stage, two
dressing rooms, and a roll-up curtain that was operated by a stage hand (Brown et al. 2002).
Historical maps illustrated the presence of Estelle Road (Feature 4) as early as the late 1800s and was
actively used until the late 1990s. Estelle Road was one of the original county roads within the area and
connected to Esters Road and County Line Road.
Remnants of both the Masonic Lodge and schoolhouse (Feature 1) were visually confirmed during the IES
survey and were located within the western half of the site and outside the current APE. No additional deed
records were obtained that document ownership of land past 1948 after the school was closed and the
Masonic Lodge relocated. However, based on the correlation between the deed records and the observed
cultural features encountered during the delineation, site 41DL521 most likely pertains to the Estelle
schoolhouse and rural transportation.

Summary
Site 41DL521 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained five features (three foundations, a
road, and a fence line) and a low to moderate density scatter of construction and household related debris.
Eight shovel tests were excavated within the site with three containing cultural materials. Several features
were identified that corresponded to structures on historical and recreated maps from personal accounts.
However, based on historical aerial photographs and field observations it was determined that the site likely
extended an additional 300 feet by 300 feet to the west of the APE. Overall, the site was general in nature,
displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas
archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
41DL522
Site 41DL522 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 165 feet by 350 feet
in a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located within a gently rolling upland setting west
of the headwaters to Estelle Creek. The site boundaries were established by the presence of a surface
manifestation of asphalt and concrete rubble (Figure 5.2) (Appendix A, Photograph 19). The site
contained the remnants of a historic-aged building and paved road/parking lot that was constructed between
1963 to 1968. Based on historical aerial photographs, the structure resembled a warehouse-type structure
typical of the time. Based on historical aerial photographs and field observations it was determined that the
site likely extended an additional 150 feet northeast of the APE.
Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs indicate the area had been cleared of vegetation and was primarily utilized for
pastureland from 1958 to 1963. The building and paved parking lot were constructed between 1963 to
1968. The structure and paved features were further modified between 1972 and 1979 when additional
space was added to the building and the pavement was improved and expanded to incorporate a larger area.
The building showed obvious signs of neglect and disrepair between 2005 to 2007. Ultimately, the building
was demolished in 2012, at which point the site became overgrown and has remained unmodified to the
present.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Due to significant disturbances from extensive agricultural activities within the site and the complete
clearing of debris and litter after the buildingâs demolition, no shovel tests were excavated. The surface
was closely examined during the pedestrian survey and only asphalt and concrete rubble was observed.
Archival Research
Site 41DL522 was located within the J.A. Burdett Survey, patented on 30 August 1866. While the oldest
documents observed during the research pertain to the B.M Harrington ownership during the late 1800s and
early 1900s, based on historical aerial photographs, the site originated between 1963 to 1968. No deed
records were obtained during the research that documented the ownership of land for the siteâs origin.
However, historical appraisal maps produced during the 1968 property survey for the DFW development
illustrated the property containing 41DL522 was owned by The Irving Columbus Club. The Irving
Columbus Club owned the property from as early as 1968 until 1997 when it sold the property to the DFW.
The Irving Columbus Club is a branch of the Catholic fraternal organization called the Knights of
Columbus.
Historical aerial photographs confirmed the non-residential building design and illustrate a large paved
parking lot. The Irving City Council Meeting Agenda for September 24, 1997 documented the planned
acquisition of the property for DFW expansion and listed an improved concrete building containing 6,970
square feet and a paved parking area.
Based on these records and the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR522
most likely pertains to The Irving Columbus Club ownership of the property.

Summary
Site 41DL522 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of The Irving
Columbus Club fraternal house. No shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation. Although a
building was observed on historical aerial photographs, the only evidence of the building identified during
the IES survey was the remnants of the associated parking lot. However, based on historical aerial
photographs and field observations it was determined that the site likely extended an additional 150 feet
northeast of the APE. Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance,
was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a
significant historical person or event.
41DL523
Site 41DL523 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 375 feet by 240 feet
in a north/south by east/west orientation (Figure 5.3) (Appendix A, Photograph 20 and 21). The site was
situated within very gently sloping undissected upland setting. The siteâs boundaries were established by
the presence of surface and subsurface artifacts. According to a historical aerial photograph from 1942 and
historic documents, the main structure corresponds to the Bear Creek Baptist Church.
Disturbances
The earliest aerial photographs of the area, dating to the mid-1940s, illustrate the presence of the main
building and an outlying structure. The main structure was relocated in 1970 and the outbuilding was
demolished between 1970 to 1972. Since demolition, the area has slowly become overgrown by vegetation.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Ten shovel tests were excavated during the delineation with two testing positive for cultural material. One
positive shovel test JH1 contained two nails and JH3 contained a plastic electrical wiring fragment. The
soils were characterized by clay loam soils that did not exceed 30 cmbs. Excavation below 30 cm was
restricted by a compact, culturally sterile clay layer (Table 5.4).

underneath the few trees within the site. The central portion of the site exhibited the highest amounts of
disturbance, containing large depression areas caused by the demolition of the church and its outbuilding.

Archival Research
Site 41DL523 was primarily located within the J. Brandenburg and M. Goodfellow surveys, which were
patented on 04 April 1856 and 21 December 1885, respectively. A small sliver of the site may have
overlapped into the P. Everard and H. Burgoon surveys as well. Based on memoirs and other historical
documents, it was determined the site pertains to the location of the Bear Creek Baptist Church. The Bear
Creek Baptist Church was originally established in 1853 along Bear Creek. In 1887, the church was
relocated three miles east to the junction of County Line Road and Estelle Road. In 1970, the DFW
purchased the land and the church was relocated to Trigg Road in Irving, Texas (Brown and Altom 2002).
A four-way road crossing was located northeast of the church and just outside the site boundary. Personal
accounts from documents at the Irving Archives described the Bear Creek Baptist Church as a one room
wooden building with associated outhouses.
Summary
Site 41DL523 was a newly recorded historic-period site with an ephemeral scatter of associated artifacts.
Ten shovel tests were excavated within the site delineation with two yielding cultural material. The site
represents a scattering of household and construction related debris concentrated underneath several
clusters of trees. The site was associated with the Bear Creek Baptist Church that occupied the area from
1887 to 1970. The church was relocated to Irving shortly after the DFW acquisition of the property and the
outlying structure demolished. Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical
disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an
association to a significant historical person or event.
41DL524
Site 41DL524 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended 635 feet by 385 feet in a north/south
by east/west orientation (Figure 5.4) (Appendix A, Photograph 22 and 23). The site was situated within
a gently sloping hill that slopes south toward Estelle Creek. The siteâs boundaries were established by the
presence of historic-aged features and associated artifacts. A historical aerial photograph dating to 1942
illustrated the site contained a large farmstead with several surrounding outbuildings located within the
north-central portion of the site. Originally, a small private road entered the site from the north and led to
the residential structure.
Disturbances
A historic-period map illustrates the farmstead and outlying structures were built prior to 1942. By 1968,
the residential structure and a majority of the outlying structures were demolished and by 1970 all remaining
structures had been demolished. Since 1970, the site has become overgrown by vegetation which has
reclaimed much of the site.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Eleven shovel tests were excavated within the site with two testing positive for cultural materials. Positive
shovel test KS6 yielded three clear glass bottle shards and one brick fragment, while KS9 contained one
clear glass fragment (Table 5.5). The soils were characterized by gravelly clay loam soils that did not
exceed past 40 cmbs. Excavation below 40 cm was restricted by a compact, culturally sterile clay layer.
The site contained a low-density ephemeral scatter of surficial artifacts and building materials. The artifacts
consisted of tin cans, glass bottles, and whiteware sherds. The building materials observed consisted of
rebar, metal wiring, a concrete post, and a few brick fragments. Three glass bottles were diagnostic and
summarized in Table 5.6.

Features
Four features were recorded during the siteâs delineation and consisted of a cement foundation, a brick lined
well, and two small iris plots.
Feature 1, was identified as containing a two foot by two foot concrete foundation with a steel pipe casing.
The casing was surrounded by four metal braces that were likely the feet of a windmill. The four braces
were located two feet away from each corner of the concrete foundation (Appendix A, Photograph 24).
Feature 2 pertained to a brick-lined well that was capped by a large cement slab. The well was
approximately three feet in diameter and extended approximately one foot above the surface. The cement
slab was approximately three feet by three feet in area and two feet in width (Appendix A, Photograph
25).
Features 3 and 4 consisted of two small areas containing planted irises. The plots appeared generally
rectangular in shape and contained no formal garden fencing or other enclosure. In addition, several planted
agave and prickly pear cacti were observed within the site and perceived as ornamental.
Archival Research
Site 41DL524 was located within the J.B. Menafee, T.P.B Armstrong, and Swing & Laws surveys, which
were patented on 03 June 1862, 11 October 1859, and 07 January 1862, respectively. Similar to site
41DL521, early deed records pertain to the Harrington familyâs ownership of the land containing 41DL524.
The earliest deed records pertaining to the land within the site detail the acquisition of the land by Wingate
Lucas from Bryant M. Harrington on 10 May 1874 (ROAM Volume 62/Page 334). The ownership and
association to the site was verified through the hand drawn map drafted by Brown and Altom in. 2002. The
map depicts site 41DL524 within the likely location of the Hodges and Lucas familiesâ homesteads.
Wingate Lucas was born in Texas on 10 April 1828 and died on 04 August 1902. Mr. Lucas was married
to Cornelia J. Dobkins around 1860 and had eight children. Both Wingate and Cornelia were buried in
Minters Chapel Cemetery. No information was obtained detailing which members of the Hodges family
lived within 41DL524. None of the deceased names were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, or on
The TexGenWeb Project website.

Summary
Site 41DL524 was a newly recorded historic-period site with four features and a moderately dense scatter
historic-period debris. Eleven shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation with two yielding
cultural material. In general, the site represents a surface and subsurface accumulation of household debris,
equipment parts, and construction related debris associated with a farmstead and several outlying structures.
Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented
within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical
person or event.
41DL525
Site 41DL525 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended 205 feet by 620 feet in a north/south
by west/east orientation. The site was located within a very gently sloping upland setting that drains to the
south toward the headwaters of Estelle Creek (Figure 5.5). The siteâs boundaries were established by the
presence of surface features and an accumulation of surface and subsurface artifacts.
A historic aerial photograph from 1942 illustrates that two small farmsteads and several outlying structures
were present along the north side of the historical Estelle Road. One farmstead was located in the western
portion of the site and the second within the eastern. Several other buildings/structures were observed
within historical aerial photographs directly adjacent to the site boundaries.
Disturbances
The earliest historic period aerial photographs of the area illustrate that both farmsteads were already
constructed by 1942. Between 1968 and 1970, both farmsteads and all of the outlying structures were
demolished. The area has remained unmodified since the demolition of the structures and vegetation has
covered much of the site.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated within the site with five testing positive for cultural material. The
positive shovel tests contained a glass bottle base, a bottle cap, a milk glass shard, a clear glass shard, a
nail, and two metal fragments (Table 5.7). Six negative shovel tests were excavated outside of the site to
determine delineation; however, as a result of spatial limits from S. Airfield Dr. and heavy disturbance
within the area, no shovel tests were conducted east of the site. Overall, the soils were characterized by
gravelly clay loam soils that did not exceed past 30 cmbs due to restriction by a compact clay layer.
The site contained a moderately dense historic scatter that was primarily concentrated along the western
and eastern extents of the site. The historic artifact scatter consisted of tin cans, glass bottle fragments and
shards, bottle caps, brick fragments, metal pails, plastic fragments, electric wiring, earthenware and
whiteware sherds, metal fragments, and wooden posts. The diagnostic artifacts observed within the site are
summarized in Table 5.8.

Features
Feature 1 consisted of the remains of a circular precast concrete well approximately three feet in diameter.
Only an approximate one-foot tall portion of the well was visible within a depressed area. An additional
cylindrical concrete feature was located next to the well. It was unclear if this represented an upper portion
of the well or some sort of culvert. Only an approximate 1.5-foot section of the upper half of the culvert
was exposed, while the remaining lay beneath the groundâs surface (Appendix A, Photograph 26).
Feature 2 consisted of a gravel road and culvert located within the eastern portion of the site. The culvert
was oriented a north/south by west/east orientation and crossed by a west to east road. Due to disturbance,
APE limitations, and ground visibility only an approximate 40-foot section of the road was recorded mainly
based on the presence of road gravel and vegetation alignment. Both the road and culvert were general in
nature and likely represent a small private drive that connected to Estelle Road to the south (Appendix A,
Photograph 27).
Feature 3 was comprised of an approximate 20-foot portion of a dilapidated fence line. The fence was
constructed out of non-barbed metal strands that had wooden posts and trees as support. Out of context
fragments of fence wiring and fallen fence posts were observed in other areas of the site (Appendix A,
Photograph 28).
Features 4 through 7 pertained to four small areas containing planted irises. Although the planted plots
varied slightly in shape and size, they were generally rectangular in shape and contained no formal garden
fencing or other enclosure (Appendix A, Photograph 29).
Archival Research
Site 41DL525 was located within the H. Burgoon Survey patented on 01 February 1857. Although deed
records from the 1800s were not encountered during the archival research, a deed dated 26 March 1904
detailing the transfer of ownership from H. (Henry) & M.V. Burgoon to J.E. (Jess) Burgoon references the
area containing 41DL525. Henry Burgoon was likely the original deeded owner of the property containing
41DL525 as the survey abstract is his namesake. In addition, the historical map detailing the Estelle
community during the early 1900s corresponds to a Jess Burgoon ownership (Brown and Altom 2002).
The map also details the Powers family as the next homestead to the east. As mentioned above, two
farmsteads located within the western and eastern portions of the site were identified within historical aerial
photographs. The western farmstead likely pertained to the Jess Burgoon family and the east to the Powers
family (Appendix E, Figure 3). Powers and Burgoon family ownership were confirmed within survey
maps drafted when the DFW acquired the land within and surrounding 41DL525
Henry Burgoon was born on 17 June 1834 in Sandusky County, Ohio and died on 16 May 1911. Mr.
Burgoon became one of the most well-known pioneers within the area. By 1860, Mr. Burgoon owned 320
Volume I: Property Inventory Project âTranche 1
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.033
Page 45

acres of the H. Burgoon Survey. Although born in the north, Mr. Burgoon served within the Texas 9th
Calvary Company A. Henry and his wife Ann Maria Grieger had 10 children. Both Henry and Ann are
buried in Minters Chapel Cemetery. Jess Burgoon was born on 15 February 1878 and died 05 July 1931
and is buried in Minters Chapel Cemetery. Jess Burgoon lived within the same house that his father Henry
Burgoon built in 1853. No information was obtained detailing which members of the Powers family lived
within 41DL525.
It appears that cultural material observed within 41DL525 pertained to the J.D. Powers family on the eastern
end of the site and the Jess Burgoon family on the west end (Appendix E, Figure 1). The old general store
associated with Henry Burgoon was documented within historical maps as being located directly west of
the Jess Burgoon house and out of the site boundary. Conflicting reports have the general store being
constructed as early as 1883 or as late as 1895 to 1890 (Nall 2010). However, it does appear to have been
built by Henry Burgoon and consisted of a simple rectangular brick building with a single-door entrance.
The general store also served as a central meeting spot for farmers when crops were out of season (Gannett
1969, Brown et al. 2002). The general store appears to have been removed sometime between 1942 and
1958.
However, as shown in Appendix E, Figures 1 and 2, the former location of the general store lies just
outside of the western boundary of the site. In addition, a historical photograph taken in front of the old
general store shows the Jess Burgoon residence east of the general store and separated by a fence line.
Shovel tests excavated in this area, west of the site were negative for cultural materials. For these reasons,
it was determined that 41DL525 was not associated with Henry Burgoon or the old general store.
No names associated with the J.D. Powers or Jess Burgoon or families were listed in the Handbook of Texas
Online or the TexGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41DL525 was a newly recorded historic-period site containing seven features and a moderately dense
historic-period artifact scatter. Fourteen shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation with five
yielding in cultural material. The site represents a scatter of household debris, equipment parts, and
construction related debris corresponding to two historic-period farmsteads and their outlying structures.
Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented
within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical
person or event.
41DL526
Site 41DL526 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 140 feet by 390 feet
in a north to south by west to east orientation (Figure 5.6) (Appendix A, Photograph 30 and 31). The site
was situated on a terrace adjacent to the headwaters of Estelle Creek. Portions of the site had been eroded
and were located downslope from the site within a broad, non-defined drainage area. The siteâs boundaries
were established by the presence of a surficial feature and an accumulation of surface and subsurface
artifacts.
A historical aerial photograph from 1942 illustrated that a farmstead was located adjacent to the siteâs
western boundary, while a historic-aged road was located immediately south of the site. Between 1963 and
1968, an additional outlying structure was constructed to the northeast and a new farmstead and outlying
structures were constructed immediately outside the eastern extent of the site.
Disturbances
A historic period aerial photograph from 1942 illustrated that a farmstead was located west of the site
boundary and the location of the site had been cleared of vegetation. A farmstead and outlying structure

were constructed between 1958 to 1963 over the cleared field. By 1972, both of the farmsteads and all of
the outlying structures were demolished. The road along the southern boundary of the site was abandoned
and reclaimed by vegetation by 1979. In addition, the siteâs location along a terrace edge has exposed the
site to prolonged erosion, which has transported many artifacts downslope and expanded the siteâs
boundaries through time.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Twelve shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation with five testing positive for cultural
material. The soils were characterized by clay loam soils that did not exceed past 30 cmbs (Table 5.9).
Excavation below 30 centimeters was restricted by a compact clay layer.

The site contained a low-density ephemeral surface scatter comprised of household debris and building
materials. The surface artifacts consisted of glass bottles and shards, plastic fragments, an oil drum, tin
cans, a spark plug, and whiteware and earthenware ceramic sherds. The building materials consisted of
metal pipes, cement slabs, brick and brick fragments, and concrete conglomerate chunks. A Ferris brick
fragment was observed within the site and was made by the Ferris Brick Company which was in production
from 1901 to 1923 in Ferris, Texas (Graves 2012). The diagnostic artifacts observed within the site are
summarized in Table 5.10.

Features
A single feature was identified during the survey and consisted of a partially buried culvert. Feature 1
extended approximately 40 feet along a northwest to southeast direction. Although partially buried, both
ends of the culvert were observed (Appendix A, Photograph 32).
Archival Research
Site 41DL526 was located within the H. Burgoon Survey patented on 01 February 1857. The earliest deed
record obtained during the archival research pertained to the transfer of property from H. Burgoon to J.
Williams on 16 August 1884 (ROAM Volume 67/Page 402). The Williams family owned the property up
to 1901 when M.N. Williams (widow) sold to A.M.L. Harrington (ROAM Volume 246/Page 371). No
additional deed records were obtained that document ownership of land after the Harrington family
purchased the property in 1901. However, based on the correlation between the deed records and the
historical map reviewed within Collection 66 at the Irving Public Archives, site 41DL526 most likely

Page 48

pertains to the Harrington family occupation. Although the map depicts a Bryant Morrison owning the
property within 41DL526, in reality it was Bryant Morrison Harrington.
Bryant Morrison Harrington was born on 29 April 1829 in Hardin County Kentucky and died on 30
November 1895 in Estelle, Texas. Bryant was married to AML (Andrew Mackey-Lucetta) Woods in 1871
who was born on 08 November 1841 and died on 02 April 1907. Together, Bryant and AML had four
children (Archibald, Sudie, Bryant, and William). Both Bryant and AML are buried in the HarringtonWoods Cemetery near the remnants of Estelle, Texas. None of the deceased names were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online, or on The TexGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41DL526 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained a single feature and low-density
historic-period artifact scatter. Twelve shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation with only
one yielding cultural material. In general, the site represents a scattering of household debris, equipment
parts, and construction related debris that were present along a terrace edge and within a lower-lying area.
Although historical documents indicate residential buildings and associated structures were once present
within and in direct proximity to the site, modern disturbances have removed any evidence of these
structures leaving only a small culvert. It was unclear if the debris was deposited at this location during
site occupation or was transplanted when the nearby standing structures were demolished. Overall, the site
was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
Harrington Family Cemetery
The northeast corner of the Harrington Family Cemetery fence was approximately 150 feet southwest of
41DL521 within Tract 1B1 (Figure 5.7). A previous cemetery assessment, conducted by the THC,
documented seven headstones, other unmarked graves, and evidence of vandalism during a countywide
survey in 2004. During the IES revisit of the cemetery, similar conditions were observed. IES observed
seven headstones that were in various stages of deterioration and disrepair. Although no signs of recent
vandalism were observed, it appears to have been affected by vandalism through time as several apparent
grave depressions were lacking markers. During the visual assessment surrounding the cemetery and within
the westernmost portion of Tract 1B1, no depressions or other evidence was observed that indicated graves
were located outside the current cemetery fence. However, surface visibility was restricted by dense
vegetation and foliage outside of the cemetery fence.
Although the current boundaries of the cemetery were denoted by chain link fencing during the IES survey,
the boundaries have not been established through archival research. Through coordination with the THC,
it was determined that unmarked graves could be located outside the current cemetery boundaries. As such,
a 150-foot non-development buffer was created surrounding the cemetery and the APE modified to increase
the distance between the cemetery and proposed development.

5.3 Northwest Logistics (Area 1C)
Overview
Area 1C was comprised of four tracts (1C1 to 1C4) that totaled 50.5 acres. And was bounded by State
Highway 121 to the north, Metro Circle to the east, West 17th Street to the south, and South Main Street to
the west. Although Tracts 1C1, 1C2, and 1C4 were included as part of the Tranche 1 APE, the entirety of
these tracts had been previously reviewed by IES in 2015 and had received concurrence from the
SHPO/THC that no historic properties will be affected on these tracts. The entirety of Area 1C was located
within environmental Zone 1 and displayed high amounts of past ground disturbance related to construction
and past land use. The one unsurveyed/reviewed tract, (1C3) was the southernmost portion of the Area 1C.
The tract was directly adjacent to a large soil stockpile to the south and West 17th Street.

Page 49

Field Observations
The channelized headwaters of a small tributary were located within the westernmost portion of the tract.
The remainder of the tract was comprised of a featureless grass field that was bisected by a concrete access
road.
HPA Survey
During the IES background review, no HPAs were assigned within Tract 1C3 as no historic-aged buildings,
structures, or other features were observed within historical aerial photographs and other referenced data.
Subsequently, Tract 1C3 was not subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, but was photographed to
document the negligible potential for cultural resources (Appendix A, Photograph 33 and 34). Tracts
1C1, 1C2, and 1C4 had been previously reviewed by the SHPO/THC and were not intensively surveyed
(Appendix A, Photographs 35 through 39).

CHAPTER 6: SITES SUMMARIES AND
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey and site delineations, 37 negative and 13 positive shovel tests were excavated
within the 1219.4-acre (493 ha) APE. As a result, six newly recorded archeological sites were encountered.
The eligibility recommendations of the six sites are briefly summarized below and a tabular summary is
presented in Table 6.1.

41DL521 was a newly recorded historic-period site associated with the remnants of the Estelle schoolhouse.
During IES investigations, only two features associated within the schoolhouse were documented
within the APE; however, an additional three features were observed directly adjacent to the APE. The
features both within and adjacent to the APE were connected by a low-density surface and subsurface
scatter of early to mid-20th century artifacts. Although, IES was unable to assess the entirety, based on
the schoolhouseâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential
to yield significant archeological data, the portion of the site within the project right-of-way is
recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL
designation, and the remaining portion of the site is undetermined. No further work is recommended
at this location.
41DL522 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of a commercial or
warehouse-type structure and paved parking lot. During IES investigations, the remnants of a paved
parking lot that was associated with a building constructed between 1963 to 1968. Based on the siteâs
lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as ineligible for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation, and the remaining portion of the
site is undetermined. No further work is recommended at this location.
41DL523 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of the Bear Creek Baptist
Church dating from the early to mid-20th century. During IES investigations, a very low-density surface
and subsurface accumulation of non-descriptive construction debris was encountered. Based on the
siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield
significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this
location.
41DL524 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of a mid-20th century
farmstead. During IES investigations, a low-density surface and subsurface artifact scatter with four
associated features were encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical
events or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended
as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended at this location.

41DL525 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of two mid-20th century
historic farmsteads. During IES investigations, a low to moderate surface and subsurface artifact scatter
was encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons
and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for
listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is
recommended at this location.
41DL526 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of a mid-20th century
farmstead. During IES investigations, a low-density accumulation of surface artifacts were
encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and
the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing
in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is
recommended at this location.
Harrington Family Cemetery was located 150 feet west of Tract 1B1 and 150 feet southwest of 41DL521.
Based on field observations and the results of a previous THC investigation, it appeared that there was
potential for unmarked graves to be located outside the current cemetery fence. Although the cemetery
boundaries have not been established through archival research, no evidence of unmarked graves or
depressions were observed outside the current cemetery fence. In addition, the APE was developed
using a 150-foot buffer surrounding the cemetery. This distance was considered sufficient for avoiding
any potential unmarked graves. No further work recommended.
Therefore, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the SHPO/THC concur with these findings
and the PIP Tranche 1 be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations.
However, if during construction any cultural resources (other than those detailed within this report) or
evidence of unmarked graves are unearthed, the operators should cease work immediately in that area. The
project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the
THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations
of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located within the Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. As the
project will occur on the DFW property, approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect
the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will
subsequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In
addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the project will
be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The PIP is designed to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial
development. The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW
Commercial Development Department and subsequently organized into four
separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4). While the survey for all four tranches
was conducted under a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that
each tranche be discussed within a separate report deliverable. This report
documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 2.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work conformed
to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone and
Joshua Hamilton between the 4th and 6th of August, 2015, under Texas Antiquities
Permit No.7373. Prior to IESâs pedestrian survey, several areas between North
Airfield Drive and Cabell Drive were identified within the eastern portion of the
project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE) that could potentially contain
historic-period cultural features and/or deposits. During the IES survey, one
archeological site (41DL527) was documented within the APE. Through
subsequent analysis, the site was determined to be ineligible within the project
right-of-way for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL, and the remaining portion of this
site was of undetermined eligibility. No further work is warranted. However, if
any cultural resources, other than those documented within this report, are
unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction activities, and
immediately contact the project environmental representative to initiate
coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to resuming any
construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of Potential
Effects (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and
recommendations. This report documents the cultural resources survey necessary to satisfy the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As requested by the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located
on the DFW property in Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. Compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) and the NHPA are required for the project as the DFW is seeking approval from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP), which is a federal action.
In addition, as the DFW is an entity of the state, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the proposed project is to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development.
The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development Department and
subsequently organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4) (Figure 1.1). Each tranche
was comprised of a variable amount of smaller âareas,â which were in turn comprised of smaller âtracts.â
Within the four tranches, there were a total of 11 areas and 49 tracts. The tranches are primarily located
within the eastern half of the DFW with approximately 53 percent located in Dallas County, 40 percent in
Tarrant County, and 7 percent in both counties. While the survey for all four tranches was conducted under
a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that each tranche be discussed within a separate
report deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 2. The
remaining tranches will be discussed within subsequent reports. The APE is plotted on the Euless and
Grapevine 7.5 Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets and recent aerial
photographs (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Archeological Resources
Tranche 2 contained two areas comprised of 11 tracts, which total 609.2 acres, and was referred to as the
APE for this project. Tranche 2 was located within the central and eastern portions of the DFW and
contained nine tracts in Dallas County and one in Tarrant County. These areas and tracts are summarized
in Table 1.1.
Although exact project design details for each tract are still in the early stages of planning, ground disturbing
activities will be typical of those required for box-style warehouse and mixed use commercial development.
Although the exact depth of ground disturbing activities has not yet been determined, subsurface
investigations within APE were assessed to culturally sterile soil.
Historic-Period Resources
While an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with the NHPA Section 106; an assessment of indirect effects would be required per
the NHPA Section 106 regulations. Thus, any standing structure of historic age, encountered within the
footprint of proposed construction, or within 300 feet (approximately 100 meters [m]) of the project area,
will be photographed and assessed for their potential eligibility for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas and Tarrant Counties are in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 42.01 inches. About
half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of
the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008; Brooks et. al 1964).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is occasionally
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries for surrounding creeks. The periphery of the DFWâs
western, southern, and eastern limits contain a more dramatic topography with more incised drainages and
a few named creeks. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the lowland Bear Creek valley
floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay rich Blackland Prairie soils to the more erosive,
sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological regions.
The topography of Tranche 2 was similar to the overall topographic pattern of the DFW with 100 percent
of the project area located within the rolling upland setting of the Blackland Prairie. Table 2.1 contains a
specific topographic description of each tract within Tranche 2.
Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
Tranche 2 was located within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion, which is characterized by lowrelief topography containing dark, thick, plastic clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson
soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost
and oldest geological group within the Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to
the late Cretaceous and is comprised of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which
grades upward into highly plastic clay (Figure 2.1) (Coffee 1980, McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2015).
Soils Description
According to soil surveys of Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the APE contained 10 soil series (USDA 2015)
(Figure 2.2). Table 2.2 provides a brief description of the 10 soils and their percentages within the APE.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicated that the current
APE has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources (TASA 2015). However, the TASA archives
indicated six archeological surveys have been conducted within one-mile of the APE (Figure 3.1). These
surveys are summarized in Table 3.1.

3.2 Previous Recorded Sites within Vicinity
A file search within the TASA identified that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National
Register Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2015).
According to the TASA records, there were 12 known sites within one-mile (~1600m) of the APE. These
sites are summarized in Table 3.2.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the soil surveys of
Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic
map, the Natural Resource Conservation Service digital soil database for Tarrant County, the National
Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant
County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, the Fort Worth District Potential
Archeological Liability Map (FT-PALM), and both past and current aerial photography.
Archeological Resources
In 2007 and 2008, AR Consultants conducted intensive pedestrian surveys of 1,210 acres on DFW
International Airport property under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4491 and published their results in the
report An Archeological Survey for Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas
and Tarrant Counties, Texas.

According to the AR Consultants study the entirety of the APE was located within the Blackland Prairie
Uplands (Zone 1) (Figure 3.2). Zone 1 consists of mostly level clay or clay loam soils over a thin layer of
limestone bedrock. Water permeates very slowly to the water table causing slow surface runoff and high
shrink and swell potential. This setting has a low biotic diversity and is dominated by short grasses. Due
to the limited resources available within the area, it has a low probability for containing prehistoric sites.
This zone has primarily been used over the last century for agricultural and ranching activities. Due to the
large-scale construction of the DFW during the late 1960s, it is unlikely to contain any intact historical sites
(Shelton et al. 2008).
Historic-Period Resources
Historical aerial photographs and topographic maps illustrate that the land within the APE was used as
agricultural land and/or pastureland as early as 1942. However, referenced documents indicated that a
farmstead was present directly adjacent to the Tract 2B1 before the fall of 1900. A 1942 aerial photograph
depicts two buildings/structures and a road located within the Tract 2B1 with several others
buildings/structures directly adjacent to the APE. Based on images observed on historicaerials.com, it
appears that any remaining structures were removed between 1968 and 1972. Since the early 1970s, the
APE has remained undeveloped and become overgrown by secondary growth. As such, the potential for
encountering historic-period resources remained moderately high within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for PIP Tranche 2 was conducted between the 4th through 6th of August 2015.
The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated
by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to field work,
the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural resources
have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600m) radius of the APE. This information
was detailed previously. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as,
historical and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Pedestrian Survey
The entirety of the APE (that had not been previously surveyed) was located within the Zone 1 setting,
which was determined by ARC as having a low potential for containing significant prehistoric and historicaged archeological sites. To verify this, a site-specific investigation that targeted the locations of known
historic-aged structures and cemeteries was developed. The DFW has a large amount of historical
information pertaining to the land use prior to the DFW construction. During the background research prior
to survey, a variety of these resources were referenced to determine, which areas would be investigated.
Each structure identified within georeferenced historical maps and data was buffered to include a one-acre
area surrounding each identified feature. Buffered areas did not denote the limits of a given survey, but
were expanded or contracted depending on field observations. Each buffered area was compared with
current land use, past disturbance, and previous survey limits to identify high probability areas (HPA). All
selected HPAs were located within areas containing some type of tree canopy that prevented the
determination of any remaining standing structures. Areas containing the historical location of a standing
structure, areas located within settings that allowed for viewing the ground (i.e. open field setting), or areas
displaying high levels of disturbance were removed from the HPA list and not subjected to an intensive
level survey. The HPAs identified for survey are represented within Figure 4.1. All remaining portions of
the APE outside the HPAs were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological
deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware
cloth to test for the presences of buried cultural material. If clay content was high and could not be
efficiently screened, material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition,
the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and
plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. Although the entire APE was comprised of 609.2 acres, due to
aforementioned reasons, acreage for the HPAs was much lower, approximately 3.3 acres. CTA survey
standards recommend that an APE with an area of 3.3 acres (1.3 ha), displaying little to no disturbance,
should have approximately 10 shovel tests (three shovel test per acre) excavated during the pedestrian
survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from this amount due to the level of disturbance, slope
observed during the pedestrian survey. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data were
geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS unit (see Figure 4.1).

4.3 Site Recording
When applicable, archeological sites were evaluated through no fewer than six shovel tests (when
topography allows or site warrants such investigation) to assess their horizontal extent and characterize

depth of archeological deposits. Negative shovel tests, the distribution of surficial artifacts/features,
topography, and/or the APE extent delineated the boundaries of each site. For the purposes of this survey,
an archeological site was defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 10 m radius, a cultural feature
observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, a positive shovel test containing two or more
subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newlydocumented sites were assigned a temporary field number and were recorded on State of Texas
Archeological Site Data forms.

4.4 Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site and each site was plotted on the
appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map. The data from any encountered site was recorded in the
field and was processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site significance and potential
eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. When applicable, a variety of data was used to assess site
significance including date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature
preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance. Completed site forms were submitted to
TARL.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant for
one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria pertain
to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B) that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
In general, cultural resources that could be eligible for listing are greater than 50 years in age. Through the
background research, it was determined that the most likely Criteria a property within the APE would be
eligible for listing under would be Criterion A, B, or C.

4.5 Archival Research
A deed search was conducted for sites that contained evidence that dated to the historic-period. The purpose
was to identify historically notable persons possibly associated with the site. Initial research was carried
out by examining the primary sources in the deed and land title records in the documents provided by the
DFW and previous archeological reports. Further research was conducted within the Dallas County Clerkâs
Rapid Online Access Method and at the Tarrant County Clerkâs office. The identified persons also
researched for historic significance in The Handbook of Texas Online and within various publications.

4.6 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the
IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs will be organized and
catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
5.1 Corporate Aviation (Area 2A)
Overview
Area 2A was comprised of two tracts (2A1 and 2A2) that totaled 30.7 acres. The two tracts were located
within the central and western portions of the DFW property. Tract 2A1 was bounded by East 16th Street
to the north, North 24th Avenue to the east, North Service Road to the west, and the American Airlines
Cargo Pick Up facility to the south. Tract 2A2 was located between West Airfield Drive and the 13R/31L
Runway. Both tracts were located within Tarrant County and were located within heavily developed
portions of the DFW. Area 2A was located entirely within environmental Zone 1.
Field Observations
The entirety of Tract 2A1 was located just west of the Tarrant/Dallas county line within environmental
Zone 1 and displayed high amounts of past ground disturbance related to grading and the construction of
several gravel parking lots. Tract 2A2 was divided by a deep, linear erosional feature that cuts southwest
to northeast across the tract. Portions of the tract outside the erosional feature have been graded flat.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, no HPAs were developed within Area 2A. Tracts 2A1 and
2A2 were both visually assessed to verify that a negligible to low potential for cultural resources existed
within Area 2A (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 4). No cultural resources were encountered.

5.2 East Aviation/East Air Cargo (Area 2B)
Overview
Area 2B consisted of nine tracts (2B1 to 2B9) that totaled 578.5 acres. The nine tracts were arranged in a
general north to south orientation within the central and eastern portions of the DFW property. The
northernmost tract (2B1) was located south of North Airfield Drive near its intersection with Cabell Drive.
Proceeding south, Tracts 2B2 to 2B8 were bounded by the 13L/31R Runway to the north, the 17L/35R
Runway to the east, the 17R/35L Runway to the west, and West Walnut Hill Lane the south. Tract 2B9
was the furthest east tract within Area 2B and was located east of the 35R/17L and west of Valley View
Lane. All tracts within Area 2B were entirely within Dallas County. Overall, the vast majority of the tracts
within Area 2B were relatively featureless and located within heavily developed portions of the DFW
property. The most topographic variation occurred within Tracts 2B1 and 2B9, which were located closest
to named streams.
Field Observations
Tracts 2B2 to 2B6, 2B8, and 2B9 were primarily comprised of maintained open grass fields and were
historically utilized for agricultural purposes (Appendix A, Photographs 5 through 18). Tracts 2B1 and
the central portion of 2B7 contained dense stands of trees, which were typically centered around the remains
of historic-aged debris or frequently inundated lower-lying areas (Appendix A, Photographs 19 through
22). The most widespread disturbances observed were located within Tracts 2B2, 2B3, and 2B4 as these
tracts have been impacted by construction and drainage improvements.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, one HPA was developed with Area 2B. The HPA was
identified at the IES office and was field verified as containing evidence of historic-period utilization. The
HPA survey totaled 6.1 acres and was inventoried using transect survey and was sampled through the

41DL527
Site 41DL527 was located within the southern portion of Tract 2B1 and extended approximately 2,650 feet
by 250 feet along a northwest/southeast by northeast/southwest orientation (Figure 5.1). The site was
located along the southern margins of a broad upland ridge and within a low-lying terrace of Hackberry
Creek. Hackberry Creek flows from northwest to southeast adjacent to the southern boundary of Tract 2B1.
The site was bounded by a historic-aged road to the west and surface artifacts along the east. Based on
historical aerial photographs and field observations it was determined that the site likely extended an
additional 200 feet by 350 feet northeast of the APE. The site pertained to an early 19th century historicperiod farmstead and the associated outlying structures.
Features
One feature was identified during the site delineation that consisted of a historic-aged road that paralleled
the northern bank of Hackberry Creek within the southern and western portions of the site. The road was
oriented in a northwest by southeast orientation and extended for 2,650 feet within Tract 2B1. The historicaged road was characterized by an approximately 12 to 14 feet wide elevated roadbed that was crowned
and contained large segments of exposed asphalt. Small portions of concrete aggregate were observed
throughout the site and the general path of the road remained clear of later successive vegetative species.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Four shovel tests were excavated during the site delineation. Shovel test JH34 was positive and contained
two glass fragments. The soils were characterized by clay loam soils that did not exceed past 30 cm below
the surface. Excavation below 30 cm was restricted by a compact, culturally sterile clay layer (Table 5.2).

The site was comprised of a low to moderate density scatter of surface and subsurface artifacts that consisted
of concrete slabs, metal wiring, a tire, sheet metal, brick and brick fragments, glass bottles and shards, and
metal fragments (Appendix A, Photographs 23 through 25). Several diagnostic artifacts were observed
during the delineation, which included two medicine bottles, a complete brick, and a brick fragment. The
diagnostic artifacts are summarized in Table 5.3. An Acme Ferris brick was observed within the site and
was made by the Acme Brick Company (AMB). The AMB operated from 1934 to 1980 in Ferris, Texas
(Graves 2012). The other brick was fragmented and had âOBEâ stamped into it. The brick was associated
with the Globe Press Brick Company that operated in Ferris, Texas from 1904 to 1923.

Disturbances
A historical aerial photograph from 1942 illustrates the presence of a road and farmstead with six outlying
structures within the site boundary. A paved driveway led from the road and encompassed the residential
structure. The outlying structures were located northwest and northeast of the residential structure and were
located outside the paved driveway loop. The historical aerial photograph also indicates that a majority of
the land surrounding the farmstead was utilized for agricultural purposes. The farmstead and outlying
structures were demolished between 1970 to 1972 after the acquisition by the DFW. The land remained
unmodified after the demolition of the farmstead and vegetation slowly reclaimed the area.
Archival Research
Site 41DL527 was located within the Elias Brush survey, which was patented on the 6th of July 1863. Other
than records from the Texas General Land Office (GLO) detailing the patenting of land to Elias Brush, no
deed grantee or grantor records pertaining to the Brush ownership were encountered during the research.
The Samâs Street Map (SSM) of Dallas County, drafted in the fall of 1900, depicted a single structure
located directly adjacent the Dallas Pacific and South Eastern Railroad (DPSER) and just outside the limits
of Tract 2B1. The structure depicted adjacent to Tract 2B1 was listed as a rented property and no family
name was provided. A USGS soil map from 1920 depicted a single structure located adjacent to an unpaved
rural road. Documents observed online indicate that the DPSER was not completed and much of the land
was purchased for construction of State Highway 114. As such, the railroad alignment depicted on the
SSM was likely inaccurate and never constructed within Tract 2B1. The highway was in operation at this
location from the late 1920s or early 1930s to some point between 1958 and 1963 when a new highway
was constructed further to the north. Although the feature recorded during the IES survey documented a
single roadbed, historical aerial photographs prior to the roadâs abandonment indicate that it was comprised
of a two-lane road separated by a narrow median.
Summary
Site 41DL527 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained a single feature within a low to
moderate scatter of surface and subsurface artifacts. Four shovel tests were excavated during the site
delineation with one testing positive for cultural materials. The site represented the remnants of a historicaged farmstead and associated outbuildings manifested through a scatter of household, equipment, and
construction debris. Based on historical aerial photographs and field observations it was determined that
the site likely extended an additional 200 feet by 350 feet northeast of the APE. Overall, the site was
general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.

CHAPTER 6: SITES SUMMARIES AND
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey and site delineations, three negative shovel tests with one positive were
excavated within the 609.2-acre (246.5 ha) APE. During the survey of Tranche 2, a single HPA was
investigated and one archeological site (41TR527) was encountered and an eligibility summary is presented
in Table 6.1
Table 6.1: Summary of NRHP Eligibility Recommendations

Site Trinomial

Ineligible within Project
Right-of-Way

41DL527

41DL527 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of an early 19th historicperiod farmstead with several outlying structures, a historic road, and a low-density artifact scatter.
Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential
to yield significant archeological data, the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation, and
that the remaining portion of the site is undetermined. No further work is recommended at this location.
Therefore, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the SHPO/THC concur with these findings
and PIP Tranche 2 be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations.
However, if any cultural resources (other than those detailed within this report) are unearthed during
construction, the operators should cease work immediately in that area. The project environmental
consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming
construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations
of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located within the Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. As the
project will occur on the DFW property, approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect
the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will
subsequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). In
addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the project will
be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The PIP is designed to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial
development. The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW
Commercial Development Department and subsequently organized into four
separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4). While the survey for all four tranches
was conducted under a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that
each tranche be discussed within a separate report deliverable. This report
documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 3.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work conformed
to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone and
Joshua Hamilton between the 4th and 6th of August, 2015. Prior to IESâs pedestrian
survey, several areas along Beltline Road and Valley View Lane, within the eastern
portion of the Tranche 3, were identified as potentially containing historic-period
cultural features and/or deposits. During the IES survey, one newly recorded
archeological site (41DL528) and one previously recorded site (41DL492) were
documented within the APE. Through the subsequent analysis, sites 41DL492 and
41DL528 were determined to be ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL.
No further work is warranted and the boundaries of the 41DL528 were revised.
However, if any cultural resources, other than those documented within this report,
are unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction activities
in those areas, and immediately contact the project environmental representative to
initiate coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to
resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of Potential
Effects (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and
recommendations. This report documents the cultural resources survey necessary to satisfy the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As requested by the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located
on the DFW property in Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. Compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) and the NHPA are required for the project as the DFW is seeking approval from the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP), which is a federal action.
In addition, as the DFW is an entity of the state, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the proposed project is to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development.
The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development Department and
subsequently organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4) (Figure 1.1). Each tranche
was comprised of a variable amount of smaller âareasâ, which were in turn comprised of smaller âtracts.â
Within the four tranches, there were a total of 11 areas and 49 tracts. The tranches are primarily located
within the eastern half of the DFW with approximately 53 percent located in Dallas County, 40 percent in
Tarrant County, and 7 percent in both counties. While the survey for all four tranches was conducted under
a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that each tranche be discussed within a separate
report deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 3. The
remaining tranches will be discussed within subsequent reports. The APE is plotted on the Euless and
Grapevine 7.5 Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets and recent aerial
photographs (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Archeological Resources
Tranche 3 contained three areas comprised of 10 tracts, which total 152.2 acres, and is referred to as the
APE for this project. Tranche 3 was located within the northern, eastern, and southern portions of the DFW
and contained nine tracts in Dallas County and one tract in Tarrant County. These areas and tracts are
summarized in Table 1.1.
Although exact project design details for each tract are still in the early stages of planning, ground disturbing
activities will be typical of those required for box-style warehouse and mixed use commercial development.
Exact depth of ground disturbing activities has not yet been determined; however, subsurface investigations
within APE were assessed to culturally sterile soil.
Historic-Period Resources
While an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with Section 106, an assessment of indirect effects would be required per the NHPA
Section 106 regulations. Thus, any standing structure of historic age, encountered within the footprint of
proposed construction, or within 300 feet (approximately 100 meters [m]) of the project area, will be
photographed and assessed for their potential eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas and Tarrant Counties are in the North-Central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 42.01 inches. About
half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of
the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008; Brooks et. al 1964).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is occasionally
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries for surrounding creeks. The periphery of the DFWâs
western, southern, and eastern limits contain more dramatic topography with more incised drainages and
named creeks. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the low-lying Big Bear Creek valley
floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay rich Blackland Prairie soils to the more erosive,
sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological regions.
The topography of Tranche 3 is similar to the overall topographic pattern of the DFW. Approximately 95
percent of the project area is located within the rolling upland setting with the remaining five percent located
within the more steeply sloped margins of the South Fork Hackberry Creek valley floor. Table 2.1 contains
a specific topographic description of each tract within Tranche 3.

Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
Tranche 3 is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion, which is characterized by low-relief
topography containing dark, thick, plastic clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil
series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and
oldest geological group within the Blackland Prairie (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the
late Cretaceous and is comprised of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which
grades upward into highly plastic clay (Figure 2.1) (Coffee 1980, McGowenet al. 1987, USGS 2014).
Soils Description
According to soil surveys of Dallas and Tarrant counties, the APE contained 12 soil series (USDA 2015)
(Figure 2.2). Table 2.2 provides a brief description of the 12 soils and their percentages within the APE.

3.2 Previously Recorded Sites within Vicinity
A file search within the TASA identified that there was one previously recorded archeological site
(41DL492) within the proposed APE. During the cultural investigation of the area, AR Consultants (ARC)
documented the site in 2008. Site 41DL492 consisted of a historic-period farmstead and several outlying
structures. Seven foundations to structures were observed, but most of the foundations had been destroyed
by heavy machinery. Historic-period artifacts were observed throughout the surface of the site and
consisted of wire nails, broken glass, tin cans, farm equipment and parts, and bricks.
There were no National Register Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed
APE (TASA 2015). According to the TASA records, there were 26 recorded sites within one-mile (~1600
m) of the APE. These sites were and are summarized in Table 3.2.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the soil surveys of
Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic map, the
Natural Resource Conservation Service digital soil database for Dallas and Tarrant Counties, the National
Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant
County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, the Fort Worth District Potential
Archeological Liability Map (FT-PALM), and both past and current aerial photography.
Archeological Resources
In 2007 and 2008, ARC conducted intensive pedestrian surveys of 1,210 acres on the DFW property under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4491 and published their results in the report An Archeological Survey for
Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas.
According to the ARC study the entirety of the APE was located within the Blackland Prairie Uplands
(Zone 1) (Figure 3.2). Zone 1 consists of mostly level clay or clay loam soils over a thin layer of limestone
bedrock. Water permeates very slowly to the water table causing slow surface runoff and high shrink and
swell potential. This setting has a low biotic diversity and is dominated by short grasses. Due to the limited
resources available within the area, it has a low probability for containing prehistoric sites. Throughout the
last century, this zone was primarily used for agricultural and ranching activities. Due to the large-scale
construction of the airport during the late 1960s, it is unlikely to contain any intact historical sites (Shelton
et al. 2008).
Historic-Period Resources
Historical aerial photographs and topographic maps illustrate that the land within the APE was used as
agricultural land and/or pastureland as early as 1956. Historical aerial photographs dating to the mid-1950s
indicated that seven farmsteads with their associated outlying structures were present within the current
APE. Based on images observed on historicaerials.com, it appears that a majority of the remaining
structures were removed between 1972 to 1979. Since the early 1970s, the APE has remained unmodified
and become overgrown by secondary growth. As such, the potential for encountering historic-period
resources remained moderately high within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for PIP Tranche 3 was conducted between the 4th through 6th of August 2015.
The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated
by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to field work,
the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural resources
have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600 m) radius of the APE. This information
was detailed previously. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as,
historical and modern topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Pedestrian Survey
The entirety of the APE (that had not been previously surveyed) was located within the Zone 1 setting,
which was determined by ARC as having a low potential for containing significant prehistoric and historicaged archeological sites. To verify this, a site-specific investigation that targeted the locations of known
historic-aged structures and cemeteries was developed. The DFW has a large amount of historical
information pertaining to the land prior to the airportâs construction. During the background research prior
to survey, a variety of these resources were referenced to determine, which areas would be investigated.
Each structure identified within georeferenced historical maps and data was buffered to include a one-acre
area surrounding each identified feature. Buffered areas did not denote the limits of a given survey, but
were expanded or contracted depending on field observations. Each buffered area was compared with
current land use, past disturbance, and previous survey limits to identify high probability areas (HPA). All
selected HPAs were located within areas containing some type of tree canopy that prevented the
determination if any standing structures were located within the area. Areas containing the historical
location of a standing structure located within settings that allowed for viewing the ground (i.e. open field
setting) or areas that displaying high levels of disturbance were removed from the HPA list and not
subjected to an intensive level survey. The HPAs identified for survey are represented within Figure 4.1.
All remaining portions of the APE outside the HPAs were photographed to document the lack of potential
for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel
test records.

4.2 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware
cloth to test for the presence of buried cultural material. If the clay content was high and could not be
efficiently screened, material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition,
the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and
plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. Although the entire APE is comprised of 1,220 acres, due to
aforementioned reasons, acreage for the HPAs was much lower at approximately 45 acres. CTA survey
standards recommend that an APE with an area of 45 acres (18.2 ha), displaying little to no disturbance,
should have approximately 23 shovel tests (one shovel test per two acres) excavated during the pedestrian
survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from this amount due to the level of disturbance observed
during the pedestrian survey. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data were
geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS unit.

4.3 Site Recording
When applicable, archeological sites were evaluated through no fewer than six shovel tests (when
topography allows or site warrants such investigation) to assess their horizontal extent and characterize
depth of archeological deposits. Negative shovel tests, the distribution of surficial artifacts/features,
topography, and/or the APE extent delineated the boundaries of each site. For the purposes of this survey,
an archeological site was defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 10 m radius, a cultural feature
observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, a positive shovel test containing two or more
subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newlydocumented sites were assigned a temporary field number and were recorded on State of Texas
Archeological Site Data forms.

4.4 Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site, and each site was plotted on the
appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map. The data from any encountered site was recorded in the
field was processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site significance and potential
eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. When applicable, a variety of data was used to assess site
significance including date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature
preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance. Completed site forms were submitted to
the TARL.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant for
one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria pertain
to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B) that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
In general, cultural resources that could be eligible for listing are greater than 50 years in age. Through the
background research, it was determined that the most likely Criteria a property within the APE would be
eligible for listing under would be Criterion A, B, or C.

4.5 Archival Research
A deed search was conducted for sites that contained evidence that dated to the historic-period. The purpose
was to identify historically notable persons possibly associated with the site. Initial research was carried
out by examining the primary sources in the deed and land title records in the documents provided by the
DFW and previous archeological reports. Further research was conducted within the Dallas County Clerkâs
Rapid Online Access Method (ROAM) and at the Tarrant County Clerkâs office. The identified persons
also researched for historic significance in The Handbook of Texas Online and within various publications.

4.6 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the
IES office in McKinney and permanently at TARL. These documents and photographs will be organized
and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
5.1 Coppell Freeway Commercial (Area 3A)
Overview
Area 3A consisted of three tracts (3A1 to 3A3) that totaled 36.2 acres. The three tracts were bounded by
the St. Louis Southwestern Railroad to the north, Royal Lane to the east, and a spur of the St. Louis
Southwestern Railroad to the south and west. Tract 3A1 is separated from 3A2 and 3A3 by Interstate
Highway 635. All tracts are entirely within Dallas County. Overall, tracts within Area 3A were relatively
featureless with a more developed setting.
Field Observations
Tracts within Area 3A were primarily comprised of open grass fields with a dense stand of cedar trees that
were located surrounding a small upland stock pond within Tract 3A3 and nearest to the St. Louis Railroad
alignment. The entirety of Area 3A was located within environmental Zone 1 and displayed high amounts
of past ground disturbance. The most wide spread disturbances observed were located within Tracts 3A2
and 3A3 as these tracts have been graded and regularly maintained.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, no HPAs were developed within Area 3A. All three tracts
were visually assessed to verify that a negligible to low potential for cultural resources existed within Area
3A (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 6). No cultural resources were encountered.

5.2 Beltline TOD (Area 3B)
Overview
The Area 3B consisted of six tracts (3B1 to 3B6) that totaled 94.9 acres. The six tracts were located along
North Belt Line Road between President George Bush Turnpike and Premier Drive. All tracts are entirely
within Dallas County. Overall, tracts within Area 3B were comprised of a dissected upland setting
demarcated by several named creeks and unnamed tributaries along the margins of two prominent
ridgelines.
Field Observations
Tracts within Area 3B were primarily characterized by moderately dense woods comprised of secondary
growth. The southernmost tracts (3B5 and 3B6) contained the highest amount of open pastures setting with
a small amount of wooded areas nearest to South Fork Hackberry Creek. Unlike other portions of the DFW
property, which contained wooded vegetation around the remains of historic-aged debris, the canopy within
Area 3B was more evenly dispersed. The entirety of Area 3B was located within environmental Zone 1.
While tracts 3B5 and 3B6 displayed higher amounts of past ground disturbance, the remaining tracts
appeared to have been exposed to a lesser amount.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, three HPAs were developed with Area 3B. Two of the
three HPAs identified at the IES office were field verified as containing some evidence of historic-period
utilization. The HPA survey totaled 21.3 acres and was inventoried using transect survey and sampled
through the excavation of 14 shovel tests. One newly recorded archeological site (41DL528) was
encountered and recorded during the HPA survey. In addition, one previously recorded site (41DL492)
was revisited to confirm site boundaries. The HPAs and their findings are summarized in Table 5.1.

Tracts 3B2, 3B4, 3B5, and 3B6 contained no evidence of historic-period occupation and were located
within a disturbed setting. Although these areas were not intensively surveyed, the areas were photographed
and documented (Appendix A, Photographs 7 through 14). A portion of Tract 3B3 was previously
surveyed during the investigation conducted by ARC. Site 41DL492 was identified and documented within
the northern portion of the tract. During the investigation conducted by IES, the southern portion of the
tract was surveyed and resulted in no additional cultural resources (Appendix A, Photographs 15 and 16).
Encountered Cultural Resources
41DL492
Previous Investigations
During the cultural investigation conducted by ARC in 2008, site 41DL492 was encountered and
documented within the easternmost portion of the DFW property and within the footprint of the proposed
DART Rail Orange Line. The site pertained to the remains of the Harrington Dairy and subsequent
occupation. Seven foundations, two silos, a shed, an outhouse, two water tanks, and several septic tanks
and meter boxes were identified with the majority of the foundations pertaining to the Harrington Dairy
complex. Cultural materials identified included a metal smoke stack, cinderblocks, glass bottle shards, and
a few unmarked bricks (Shelton and Davis 2008). The majority of the site was destroyed during the
construction of the DART parking lot. In 2008, the THC determined 41TR492 was ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP or listing as a SAL.
Observations and Shovel Testing
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41DL492 was revisited to verify the siteâs presence and the THCâs
NRHP eligibility determination. The site boundaries provided by the TASA extended outside the APE
(Figure 5.1). As such, the cultural investigation was limited to documenting areas within the boundaries
of the APE, totaling approximately 0.3-acre.
During the cultural resources investigation conducted by IES, a surface accumulation of artifacts was
observed that was of historic-age, but of undetermined association with the Harrington Dairy. The artifacts
were located along the crest line of a rapidly ascending hill and consisted of glass bottle shards, scrap metal,
brick fragments, and cut sandstone blocks. The observed artifacts extended an approximately 150 feet west
of the original site boundary established by ARC. Due to the topographic setting and disturbed nature of
the site, no shovel tests were excavated.
Summary
Site 41DL492 was a previously recorded historic-period farmstead recorded by ARC in 2008. The THC
provided concurrence that the site was ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. Observations
determined that the portion of 41DL492 with the APE was minor and insignificant in nature with the
majority of the site being demolished with the construction of the DART Rail Orange Line and adjacent
parking lot.

41DL528
Site 41DL528 was located within the western portion of Tract 3B1 and extended approximately 510 feet
by 400 feet (Figure 5.2). The site is located within a dissected upland setting along a sloping hill that trends
from the southeast to the northwest towards an unnamed tributary of Hackberry Creek. The site boundaries
were bounded by the DART Rail Orange Line to the west and features and surface artifacts to the east
(Appendix A, Photographs 17 through 19). The site likely pertained to a residential neighborhood that
was constructed during the late 1960s. Although five features were recorded during the site delineation,
only two were located within the APE. During site delineation, it was determined the site extended
approximately 500 feet by 100 feet to the west of the APE. The remaining three features outside the APE
were still within the DFW property and were recorded due to their direct affiliations to the site.
Shovel Testing and Observations
Six shovel tests was excavated during the site delineation and resulted in no cultural materials. The soils
were characterized by gravelly clay loam soils that did not exceed past 40 cm below the surface. Excavation
below 40 cm was restricted by a compact, culturally sterile clay layer.
The site was dominated by a moderately dense scatter of historic-aged artifacts that consisted of tin cans,
brick and brick fragments, metal fragments, sheet metal, glass bottles and shards, concrete slabs, and large
sign with a metal base with concrete attached. Several diagnostic artifacts were observed during the
delineation, which included glass bottles and a brick. A Ferris brick fragment was observed within the site
and was made by the Ferris Brick Company, which was in production from 1901 to 1923 in Ferris, Texas
(Graves 2012). The diagnostic artifacts observed within the site are summarized in Table 5.2.

Features
Five features were identified within the site and are associated with a 1960s residential neighborhood.
Features 3, 4, and 5 were located outside the APE, but were recorded due to their location directly adjacent
to the APE and association with the two features encountered within the APE.
Feature 1 was located within the northeastern portion of the site and consisted of a circular concrete
foundation (Appendix A, Photographs 20 and 21). The foundation was six feet in diameter and half a
foot in width. Based on a historical aerial photograph from 1968, the foundation was located behind a
residential structure and likely corresponded to associated outbuilding.
Feature 2 was located within the southeastern portion of the site. The feature was associated with a cement
foundation that extended 130 feet by 75 feet in a north/south by east/west orientation (Appendix A,
Photographs 22 and 23). The foundation was approximately half a foot in width and resembled an âLâ
shape. The elevation was lower along the north and south foundation and a single step separated the north
and south foundation from the west to east foundation. The north and south foundation correlated to the
driveway of the property, while the west and east oriented foundation was where the residential structure
occupied.

Feature 3 was the southernmost feature within the site and was situated 45 feet to the west of Feature 2.
The feature was associated with a cement foundation that extended 115feet by 60 feet in a north/south by
east/west orientation (Appendix A, Photographs 24 and 25). The foundation was similar in width to
Feature 2 and resembled a backwards âLâ shape. Similar to Feature 2, aerial photography illustrated the
north and south oriented portion of the foundation was utilized as the driveway, while the west and east
oriented foundation was used for the residential structure.
Feature 4 was located 40 feet west of the APE boundary and 100 feet northwest of Feature 3. The feature
consisted of a precast concrete culvert that extended 50 feet along a southwest and northeast direction. The
culvertâs termini were partially exposed and was general in nature for the period in which it was installed
(Appendix A, Photograph 26).
Feature 5 was located 50 feet west of the northwestern portion of the APE boundary. The feature consisted
of a circular precast concrete well approximately three feet in diameter with an associated water pipe. The
top of the well was even with the groundâs surface, while the majority of the wellâs interior had been filled
leaving only an approximate 1.5-foot portion exposed (Appendix A, Photographs 27 and 28).
Disturbances
A historical aerial photograph from 1942 illustrated that the area contained small clusters of trees disbursed
throughout an open grassland environment. The aerial photograph depicted the presence of a historicperiod farmstead with several outlying structures adjacent to the eastern site boundary. Between 1958 to
1968, the area was developed into a residential neighborhood. A road was constructed from North Beltline
Road and proceeded west through the central portion of the site. The road split the neighborhood into north
and south sections. All of the residential structures and their associated infrastructure were demolished
between 1968 to 1972. Based on subsequent aerial images, it appears the structures and foundations north
of the road were almost completely removed, while many of the southern foundations were exposed to less
disturbance. The area has remained unmodified since the demolition of the structures.
Archival Research
Site 51DL528 was located within the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railroad Company (BBBC),
which was patented on the 12th of August 1859. Other than records from the Texas General Land Office
(GLO) detailing the patenting of land to the BBBC, no deed grantee or grantor records pertaining to the
ownership were encountered during the research. The Samâs Street Map (SSM) of Dallas County, drafted
in the fall of 1900, illustrated that no residential structures were located within the survey. The BBBC was
the first railroad operating in the state of Texas and the company purchased many land tracts within Dallas
County where construction was planned. Construction halted during the Civil War and with the financial
collapse of Texas during reconstruction, the BBBC Company failed. The railroad track and rolling stock
were purchased and reincorporated as the Galveston, Harrisburg, & San Antonio Railroad (TSHA 2015).
Summary
Site 41DL528 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained three foundations, a culverted pipe,
a concrete encasing with clay pipe, and a moderately dense historic-period artifact scatter. Only a single
shovel test was excavated within the site boundary due to significant ground disturbances occurring within
the area. While historical aerial photographs indicated the presence of a residential neighborhood occurring
in the area, only the three foundations remain. Although the site extended approximately 500 feet by 100
feet to the west of the APE, the site was completely delineated within DFW property. Overall, the site was
general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.

5.3 North of Southgate (Area 3C)
Overview
The North of Southgate consisted of a single tract (3C1) that totaled 21.1 acres. The tract was bounded by
International Service Road to the west, South Airfield Drive to the north, North Garage Drive to the east,
and East 38th Street to the south. The tract lies entirely within Tarrant County. Overall, Tract 3C1 was
relatively featureless and lies within a dissected upland.
Field Observations
Tract 3C1 was primarily comprised of open grass fields with an isolated dense stand of trees. Unlike other
portions of the DFW property, which contained wooded vegetation around the remains of historic-aged
debris, no debris was observed nor structure plotted on historical maps. The entirety of Tract 3C1 was
located within environmental Zone 1 and displayed high amounts of past ground disturbance. The most
widespread disturbance occurred in areas that had been historically utilized for agricultural activities or
adjacent to commercial development and roads.
HPA Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, no HPAs were developed within Area 3C. The single tract
was visually assessed to verify that a negligible to low potential for cultural resources existed within Area
3A (Appendix A, Photographs 29 and 30). No cultural resources were encountered.

CHAPTER 6: SITES SUMMARIES AND
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey and site delineation, 14 negative shovel tests were excavated within the 152.2acre (61.6 ha) APE. Through the survey, two archeological sites (41DL492 and 41DL492) were
encountered. The eligibility recommendations of the two sites are briefly summarized below and a tabular
summary is presented in Table 6.1.

Ineligible

41DL492, 41DL528

41DL492 was a previously recorded historic-period site. Although the THC determined 41DL492 was
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a SAL in 2008, IES revisited the site in an effort to
verify the eligibility determination and the accuracy of the horizontal boundaries. Due to APE
limitations, only a 0.3- acre portion of the recorded site was revisited by IES. During the IES survey a
low-density surficial accumulation of non-diagnostic artifacts was encountered approximately 150 feet
outside the original site boundaries. However, as IES was unable to assess the entirety of the site, a
verification of the THC eligibility determination was not conducted. Based on the siteâs lack of
association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as ineligible for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended
at this location.
41DL528 was a newly recorded historic-period site comprised of five features and a low-density scatter of
historic-period artifacts. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or
persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended at this location.
Therefore, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the THC/State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) concur with these findings and PIP Tranche 3 be permitted to continue without the need
for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources (other than those detailed
within this report) are unearthed during construction, the operators should cease work immediately in that
area, and the THC/SHPO should be contacted prior to resuming construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC for the
Property Inventory Project (PIP) located within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport
(DFW) property. As the project will occur on DFW property, approval from the Federal
Aviation Administration will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan to reflect the
permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will subsequently
require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT).
The PIP is designed to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development.
The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development
Department and subsequently organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4).
While the survey for all four tranches was conducted under a single Antiquities Permit
(#7373), the DFW requested that each tranche be discussed within a separate report
deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche
4. Tranche 4 contained three areas comprised of 14 tracts, which totaled 645.4 acres within
Tarrant County, Texas.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources, which
include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the
proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility for listing
as a State Antiquities Landmark or eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. All work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outline the
regulations for implementing the ACT.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone, Joshua
Hamilton, and Anne Gibson between 28 September to 13 October 2015. During the IES
survey, eight newly recorded archeological sites (41TR290, 41TR291, 41TR292, 41TR293,
41TR294, 41TR295, 41TR296, and 41TR297) and five previously recorded sites (41TR17,
41TR18, 41TR20, 41TR82, and 41TR241) were reassessed within the APE. Although sites
41TR17, 41TR18, and 41TR241 had already received State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO)/Texas Historical Commission (THC) determination as ineligible for listing on the
NRHP or as a SAL, IES revisited each site to verify determination and horizontal boundaries.
In addition, Bear Creek Cemetery and Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery were assessed
for potential unmarked graves outside of known cemetery boundaries. Through the
subsequent analysis, sites 41TR18, 41TR82, 41TR290, 41TR291, 41TR292, 41TR293,
41TR294, 41TR295, 41TR296, and 41TR297 were determined to be ineligible for listing on
the NRHP or as a SAL and no further work is warranted. Due to APE limitations, only
portions of 41TR17 and 41TR20 were revisited during the IES survey. Site 41TR17 was
determined to be ineligible within the project right-of-way for listing on the NRHP or as a
SAL, and the the remaining portion was of undetermined eligibility. The eligibility of site
41TR20 was undetermined. Although 41TR219 was located within the APE, the site was
not revisited by IES as it had been sufficiently documented through previous survey and
eligibility testing and received SHPO/THC concurrence of NRHP/SAL ineligibility.
However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should
cease work immediately in that area, and the THC/SHPO should be contacted prior to
resuming any construction activities. In addition, any ground disturbances within 25-feet of

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of Potential
Effects (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and
recommendations. This report documents the cultural resources survey necessary to satisfy the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As requested by the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located
on the DFW property. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the NHPA
are required for the project as the DFW is seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP), which is a federal action. In addition, as the DFW is an
entity of the state, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the proposed project is to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development.
The lease of these tracts has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development Department and
subsequently organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4) (Figure 1.1). Each tranche
was comprised of a variable amount of smaller âareas,â which were in turn comprised of smaller âtracts.â
Within the four tranches, there were a total of 11 areas and 49 tracts. The tranches are primarily located
within the eastern half of the DFW with approximately 53 percent located in Dallas County, 40 percent in
Tarrant County, and 7 percent in both counties. While the survey for all four tranches was conducted under
a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that each tranche be discussed within a separate
report deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted within Tranche 4. The
other tranches have been discussed within previous reports. The APE is plotted on the Euless and Grapevine
7.5 Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets and recent aerial photographs
(Figures 1.2 and 1.3).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Archeological Resources
Tranche 4 contained three areas that were comprised of 14 tracts, which total 645.4 acres, and is referred to
as the APE for this report. Tranche 4 was located within the western and southwestern portion of the DFW
and all 14 tracts are within Tarrant County. These areas and tracts are summarized in Table 1.1.
Although exact project design details for each tract are still in the early stages of planning, ground disturbing
activities will be typical of those required for box-style warehouse and mixed use commercial development.
Exact depth of ground disturbing activities has not yet been determined; however, subsurface investigations
within the APE were assessed to culturally sterile soil.

Historic-Period Resources
While an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with Section 106, an assessment of indirect effects would be required per the NHPA
Section 106 regulations. Thus, any standing structure of historic age, encountered within the footprint of
proposed construction, or within 300 feet (approximately 100 meters [m]) of the project area, will be
photographed and assessed for their potential eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is located in the North-Central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.01 inches. About
half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of
the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is occasionally
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries for surrounding creeks. The periphery of the DFWâs
western, southern, and eastern limits contain more dramatic topography with more incised drainages and
named creeks. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the low-lying Big Bear Creek valley
floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay rich Blackland Prairie soils to the more erosive,
sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological regions.
The topography of Tranche 4 is similar to the overall topographic pattern of the DFW. Approximately 90
percent of the project area is located within the rolling upland setting with the remaining 10 percent located
within the more steeply sloped margins of the Big Bear Creek valley floor. Table 2.1 contains a specific
topographic description of each tract within Tranche 4.
Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
The majority of Tranche 4 is located within the Eastern Cross Timbers. However, small portions of the NE
Bear Creek Area partially enter the Blackland Prairies Uplands and the Bear Creek Floodplain. Big Bear
Creek flows from the northwest to the southeast through the western portion of the DFW. The current creek
channel was located between the NW Bear Creek and NE Bear Creek Areas and east of the South Bear
Creek Area. The creek is a recognized natural division of the Northern Blackland Prairie and the Eastern
Cross Timbers regions (McGowen et al. 1984). Variation of soil and vegetation among each ecoregion is
a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999).
Eastern Cross Timbers
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987.) The countless hills were once heavily wooded by dense stands of oak, walnut,
blackjack, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the region
as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban expansion,
agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become highly fragmented
and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains today (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
[TPWD] 2015). The APE is underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation. The Woodbine
underlies the Eagle Ford Formation and the strata dates back to the Late Cretaceous during the Upper
Cenomanian stage (Winton 1925). The Woodbine is primarily composed of sandstone, but also contains a
small percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay (Figure 2.1).
Northern Blackland Prairie
The Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion is characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick,
plastic clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle

Page 193

Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within
the Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised
of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic
clay (Coffee and Ressel 1980, McGowen et al. 1987).
Soils Description
According to soil surveys of Tarrant County, the APE contained 17 soil series (USDA 2015) (Figure 2.2).
Table 2.2 provides a brief description of the 17 soils and their percentages within the APE.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicated that seven
previous surveys have been conducted within the APE (TASA 2015). These surveys are summarized in
Table 3.1 and illustrated in Figure 3.1. In addition, the TASA database indicated that six previous surveys
have been conducted within one-mile of the APE and are summarized in Table 3.2.
AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted a survey of the DFW property in 2008 under Texas Antiquities
Permit #4491. The survey consisted of investigating approximately 1,210 acres for natural gas extraction
and pipeline construction. The survey resulted in documenting 23 newly recorded or revisited archeological
sites. Two sites (41TR219 and 41TR221) were selected for further testing and were later determined
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. The survey covered variable amounts of
acreage within Areas 4A, 4B, and 4C.
In 2010, Geo-Marine Inc. (GMI), conducted a survey within the southern portion of the DFW property
under Texas Antiquities Permit #5563. The survey consisted of investigating 790 m of pipeline right-ofway (ROW) and a 9.9-acre parcel. As a result of the survey, a single archeological site (41TR241) was
identified and determined ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. The boundaries
of the survey overlapped within small areas of Tracts 4A1, 4A4, and 4A5.
Hicks & Company conducted a survey within the southwestern portion of the DFW property in 2010 under
Texas Antiquities Permit #5773. A total of 10.95 acres of linear area were surveyed for the expansion of
Mid Cities Boulevard. As a result of the survey, a single archeological site, 41TR17, was revisited and no
evidence for cultural materials was observed. The survey overlapped with a very small portion within
Tracts 4B2 and 4C5.
IES conducted a survey within the southwestern portion of the DFW property under Texas Antiquities
Permit #6835. Two previously documented archeological sites were revisited. Site 41TR19 was not
encountered and has likely been improperly mapped within the TASA and site 41TR218 was determined
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. The survey consisted of investigating the
44.68 acre parcel of Tract 4C2.
IES conducted another survey within the southwestern portion of the DFW property under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7126. Three archeological sites (41TR273, 41TR274, and 41TR275) were documented
and determined ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. The survey consisted of
investigating the 72.3 acre parcel of Tract 4C7.

3.2 Previously Recorded Sites within Vicinity
A file search within the TASA identified that there were 10 previously recorded archeological sites within
the proposed APE (Table 3.3). The TASA database indicated there were no National Register Properties,
historical markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2015). The TASA records did
indicate that there were 24 previously established archeological sites within one-mile (~1600 m) of the APE
and are summarized in Table 3.4.

3.3 Prehistoric Chronology
The APE lies within the North-Central Texas archeological region. Archeological investigations within the
region have been summarized by Hoffman and Brooks (1989), Lynott (1981), McCormick (1976), Prikryl
(1990), Story et al. (1990), and Vehik (1994). Despite these contributions, the lack of data presents an
incomplete understanding of the archeological record within the region. The cultural chronological
sequence of the region begins with the Paleoindian and transitions to the Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Periods.
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period began as the Pleistocene epoch was ending. It is estimated to have occurred in the
North-Central Texas region around 11,150 to 8,500 (before present [circa 1950]) B.P. The Clovis culture
is the earliest well defined culture in Texas and consists of kill, quarry, cache, camp, ritual, and burial sites.
Early research thought the Paleoindian lifestyle was dependent on the hunting of Late Pleistocene fauna
including mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse. However, current research indicates that the
Clovis culture utilized a wide variety of flora and fauna and did not rely solely on megafauna (Bousman et
al. 2004; Collins 1995).
The Folsom culture followed the Clovis and Folsom archeological sites are fairly common in Texas.
Folsom site types found in Texas consists of camp, stone-working, and kill sites (Holliday 1995). In
contrast to the Clovis culture, the Folsom populations were evidently highly mobile and specialized bison
hunters (Collins 1995). Bison bones are found in every Folsom site where faunal remains were preserved
and the sites were generally situated near grassland habitats. The Early Paleoindian period is characterized
by Clovis and Folsom projectile points, while the transition between the Early and Late Paleoindian periods
was characterized by several unfluted projectile point styles (Collins 2002).
Archaic Period
A climatic shift occurred around 8,000 B.P. and marked the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene
epoch. The changing environment altered the landscape and prehistoric inhabitants adapted with the
change. The decline and eventual extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
populations forced inhabitants to focus on deer, antelope, and other smaller game (Bousman and Oksanen
2012; Collins 1995). The change of subsistence practices resulted in technological shifts resulting in a
greater diversity of lithic technology and the use of fire-cracked rocks for hearths, ovens, middens, and
other thermal features (Collins 1995). The Archaic period is further divided into early, middle, and late
sub-periods.

Volume IV: Property Inventory Project âTranche 4
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 205

The Early Archaic interval occurred in North-Central Texas from 8,500 to 6,000 B.P. and is primarily
documented from surface collections (Prikryl 1990). Significant changes in lithic technology occurred
during the Early Archaic and are evident through the development of notched projectile points, specialized
tools for woodworking, and grinding and hammering stones (Collins 1995). Projectile points associated
with the Early Archaic period include early split stemmed and perhaps Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story et
al. 1990). While the basic hunter gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, a shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. Bison during this interval were evidently scarce or absent and it is speculated that
the decline in the number of bison within the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets (Collins
1995). Subsistence efforts began to focus on local resources such as deer, fish (Turner and Hester 1999),
nuts, fruits, small mammals, and invertebrates (Collins 1995). In addition, they most likely relied on
harvesting a wide range of plant resources (Bousman and Oksanen 2012), especially those that provided
resources throughout the year such as prickly pear and lechugilla (Story 1985). Due to the change in
subsistence practices, researchers have suggested that there was a high degree of mobility within large,
poorly defined territories (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story 1985; Prikryl 1990).
The Middle Archaic interval occurred from 6,000 to 3,500 B.P. and is poorly represented within the NorthCentral Texas region. Projectile points associated with the Middle Archaic period include Andice, Bell,
Calf Creek, Dawson, Carrollton, Wells, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990). It is suggested that
there was a significant population increase during this interval (Black 1989; Turner and Hester 1999). With
the wide disbursal of Middle Archaic projectile points (Black 1995) and increased frequency in the use of
fire-cracked rock cooking technology (Lohse et al 2014; Hall et al. 1986) it is suggested populations
continued to interact as the population grew and came into contact with one another.
The Late Archaic interval took place from 3,500 to 1,300 B.P. and is well documented within the region.
Prikryl (1990) suggests that the population density for the region increased during the Late Archaic due to
an increase in the number of sites and distribution over the landscape. During the Late Archaic, there was
a higher diversity of projectile point types and a distinctive decrease in the size of Late Archaic projectile
points when compared to the Middle Archaic points (Collins 1995). Projectile points associated with the
Late Archaic period include Marshall, Edgewood, Castroville, Ellis, Trinity, Dallas, Palmillas, Yarbrough,
Godley, Gary, and Elam (Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period occurred between 1,300 to 300 B.P. and is further divided into the Austin and
Toyah sub-periods or phases (Lynott 1977, Prikryl 1990). The transition from the use of atlatls to the
utilization of the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery brought about significant changes to
prehistoric life.
The Austin phase occurred from 1,300 to 700 B.P. During the Austin phase, lithic projectile point
technology transitioned from atlatls dart points to large arrow points. The Catahoula, Alba, Steiner, and
Scallorn arrow points represent the projectile typology within this cultural interval. Sites from this phase
tend to consists of thin deposits, which likely reflect small, mobile groups. Faunal material suggests a broad
subsistence strategy including small and medium mammals and in limited quantity fish and freshwater
mussels (Ricklis 1996). It is speculated that during this phase there was a population decrease. There is
also evidence of conflict during this phase and several burials have revealed incidents of fatal arrow wounds
(Black 1989).
The transition to the Toyah phase was the result of several cultural manifestations taking place between 700
to 300 B.P. in Texas. Among these were the use of pottery, the re-introduction of blade technology, and
the presence of bison processing tools (Boyd 2012). The ceramics are mostly bone-tempered with stick
brushed exteriors used to create plainware jars, bowls, and ollas. The lithic projectile point typology for
this phase consists of the Perdiz arrow point (Collins 1995), which is characterized by contracting stem
points with flared barbed shoulders (Turner and Hester 1999).

The presence of domesticates at the Cobb-Pool (41DL148) site and other nearby locations has sparked
debate surrounding the timing and extent of maize agriculture during the Late Prehistoric period in NorthCentral Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Brown and Simmons 1987). Huhnke and Wurtz (2004) suggest
the stable carbon isotope value for a single disturbed burial, dating to 800 B.P., is comparable to those of
initial maize-consuming Caddo populations in Arkansas. Based on these findings they suggest maize
horticulture may have been introduced into North-Central Texas around 800 B.P. However, without
additional samples this suggestion is speculative.
Protohistoric Period
The transition to the beginning of the Protohistoric period is characterized by contact between indigenous
groups and Europeans. Information from this period comes from written accounts by Europeans and
generally reflected life within the missions. Information about Native American life outside the missions
is scarce and what documents do exist was written from a Eurocentric perspective. The beginning of the
Protohistoric period in Texas occurs in 1528, when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca and members of his
crew were marooned in Southeast Texas. Cabeza de Vaca spent five to six years among hunter and gatherer
indigenous populations in Southeast and South Texas and parts of Northern Mexico before arriving in
Mexico City in 1536. The earliest historical accounts of Texas come from a joint report from all four
survivors and an account written by de Vaca at a later date between 1537 to 1541 (Kreiger 2002).
The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 led to the temporary expulsion of the Spanish from the New Mexico Territories
and as they retreated, the Spanish were forced to leave behind thousands of horses (Newcomb 1961). The
introduction of horses to the natives en masse completely revolutionized some native cultures and rapidly
advanced their hunting and warfare capabilities. The Apache, who had adapted to life on the plains and
hunting bison, embraced the use of the horse and now had a means of transportation that would allow them
to dominate the plains of the Texas panhandle. They began taking over the hunting grounds in Central
Texas and pushed opposing tribes either southward towards the Spanish Missions or northward towards the
North-Central Texas region (Campbell 1991). The Comanches were another powerful force during this
time in Texas and were relatively latecomers to the area. Coming from the Great Plains, they began raiding
and taking horses from the New Mexico area and reinvented themselves as mounted warriors. They entered
the areas of Northwestern Texas in the 1720s and waged a long war against the Lipan Apaches, pressuring
them and pushing them out from their homelands (Weddle 1964).
Historic Period
The establishment of the first Spanish missions in the early 1700s marks the beginning of the Historic
period. Spanish missions and settlements in Central and South Texas were often threatened by raids and
refugees and settlers often took shelter within the missions (Chipman and Joseph 2010). The Spanish never
fully understood the Native Americans political system and often assumed that when they agreed to a treaty
or alliance with one group that it reflected the larger group, which was not the case.
In 1821, the nation of Mexico had its independence from Spain and almost immediately was in conflict
with the Texas colonists. The Mexican Constitution of 1824 drew immediate repercussions due to the
attempt to limit the freedom of the Texas colonists. Throughout this period and its early times as an
independent nation, Texas had to deal with Native American problems and issues (Weddle 1964).
By 1849, the population had increased enough to warrant additional military support and Camp Worth was
established as an Army outpost. After the Civil War and during Reconstruction years the area suffered a
decline in population and economic activities. However, in 1870 the construction of the Texas and Pacific
Railroad and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad through Fort Worth revitalized the economy and secured
future economic development. The combination of agriculture and cattle ranching activities continued to
fuel growth in Tarrant County and the population increased from 41,142 to 152,800 between 1890 and
1920.

Volume IV: Property Inventory Project âTranche 4
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 207

The economy continued to improve with the onset of World War II and Fort Worth became an aviation
powerhouse in both the military and manufacturing sectors. The area experienced a population surge during
the mid to late 20th century and the population rose from 361,253 in 1950 to 1.4 million by 2000.

3.4 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the soil surveys of
Tarrant County, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic map, the Natural
Resources Conservation Service digital soil database for Tarrant County, the National Archives and
Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant County, the Texas
Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, the Fort Worth District Potential Archeological Liability Map
(FT-PALM), and both past and current aerial photography.
Archeological Resources
In 2007 and 2008, ARC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of 1,210 acres on the DFW property
under Texas Antiquities Permit #4491 and published their results in the report An Archeological Survey for
Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas.
According to the ARC study the APE was primarily located within the Eastern Cross Timbers (Zone 2)
(Figure 3.2). Zone 2 consists of a wide variety of soils and includes the uplands, ridges, terraces, tributary,
and valleys of the Eastern Cross Timbers. This setting has a diverse biotic diversity and supports woody
and herbaceous plants. Prehistoric and historic cultural resources are likely within Zone 2 due to the welldrained soils and an abundance of diverse natural resources (Shelton et al. 2008).
Historic-Period Resources
Historical aerial photographs and topographic maps illustrate that the majority of land within the APE was
used as agricultural land and/or pastureland as early as the early 1940s. Historical aerial photographs dating
to 1942 indicated that seven farmsteads with their associated outlying structures were present within the
current APE. Based on images observed on historicaerials.com, it appears that a majority of the remaining
structures were removed between 1972 and 1979. Since the early 1970s, the APE has remained unmodified
and become overgrown by primary growth. As such, the potential for encountering historic-period
resources remained moderately high within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for PIP Tranche 4 was conducted between 28 September to 13 October 2015.
The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated
by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to field work,
the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural resources
have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600 m) radius of the APE. This information
was detailed previously. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as,
historical and modern topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Pedestrian Survey
The entirety of the APE (that had not been previously surveyed) was primarily located within the Zone 2
setting, which was determined by ARC as having an elevated potential for containing significant prehistoric
and historic-aged archeological sites. To address the elevated probability for both prehistoric and historicaged resources, a 100 percent pedestrian survey accompanied by intensive systematic shovel testing was
conducted across the APE. The intensive survey also consisted of the examination of the ground surface
and existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of a multiple transect scheme with transect lines spaced at 40 m intervals orientated north and south across
the project area. Areas displaying negligible potential for containing cultural deposits were photographed
to document the lack of potential. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel
test records.
In addition, using historical information pertaining to land use prior to the airportâs construction, areas
containing historic-aged structures were identified with the APE. Each structure identified within
georeferenced historical maps and data was buffered to include a one-acre area surrounding each identified
feature. Buffered areas did not denote the limits of a historic-period use, but were expanded or contracted
depending on field observations. Each buffered area was compared with current land use, past disturbance,
and previous survey limits to identify historical resource high probability areas (HRHPA). All selected
HRHPAs were located within areas containing some type of tree canopy that prevented the determination
of identifying any standing structures within the area. Areas containing the historical location of a standing
structure, within a setting that allowed for viewing the ground (i.e. open field setting) or areas that
displaying high levels of disturbance, were removed from the HRHPA list and not subjected to an intensive
level survey. The HRHPAs identified for survey are represented within Figure 4.1. Although the
systematic shovel testing methodology did not vary from the overall 100 percent survey methodology,
surveyors were aware of the elevated potential for a specific resource type.

4.2 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware
cloth to test for the presence of buried cultural material. If the clay content was high and could not be
efficiently screened, material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition,
the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and
plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. Although the entire APE is comprised of 645.4 acres, due to
aforementioned reasons, acreage for the HPAs was much lower at approximately 108.63 acres. CTA survey
standards recommend that an APE with an area of 108.63 acres (43.96 ha), displaying little to no
disturbance, should have approximately 66 shovel tests (one shovel test per two acres) excavated during
the pedestrian survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from this amount due to the level of

disturbance observed during the pedestrian survey. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other
site data were geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS unit.

Figure 4-1: High Probability Areas

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 212

Site Recording
When applicable, archeological sites were evaluated through no fewer than six shovel tests (when
topography allows or site warrants such investigation) to assess their horizontal extent and to characterize
the depth of archeological deposits. Negative shovel tests, the distribution of surficial artifacts/features,
topography, and/or the APE extent delineated the boundaries of each site. For the purposes of this survey,
an archeological site was defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 10 m radius, a cultural feature
observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, a positive shovel test containing two or more
subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newlydocumented sites were assigned a temporary field number and were recorded on State of Texas
Archeological Site Data forms.
Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site, and each site was plotted on the
appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map. The data from any encountered site was recorded in the
field was processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site significance and potential
eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. When applicable, a variety of data was used to assess site
significance including date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature
preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance. Completed site forms were submitted to
the TARL.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant for
one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria pertain
to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B) that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
In general, cultural resources that could be eligible for listing are greater than 50 years in age. Through the
background research, it was determined that the most likely Criteria a property within the APE would be
eligible for listing under would be Criterion A, B, or D.
Archival Research
A deed search was conducted for sites that contained evidence that dated to the historic-period. The purpose
was to identify historically notable persons possibly associated with the site. Initial research was carried
out by examining the primary sources in the deed and land title records in the documents provided by the
DFW and previous archeological reports. Further research was conducted at the Tarrant County Clerkâs
office. The identified persons also researched for historic significance in The Handbook of Texas Online
and within various publications.
Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the
IES office in McKinney and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs will be
organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
5.1 South Bear Creek (Area 4A)
Overview
Area 4A consisted of five tracts (4A1 to 4A5) that totaled 349.2 acres. The five tracts were bounded by
Big Bear Creek and Bear Creek Golf Club to the north, International Parkway to the east, State Highway
(SH) 183 to the south, and SH 360 to the west. All of the tracts are within Tarrant County.
Field Observations
Tracts within Area 4A were primarily comprised of dense mixed woods with an understory containing
extremely thick accumulations of brier, vine, and saplings within a rolling upland setting. Vegetative and
soil observation confirmed the entirety of Area 4A was located within environmental Zone 2. Historically,
the majority of land within Area 4A was utilized for agricultural purposes and ground disturbing activities
would have included clearing vegetation, modifying the land to create agricultural terraces, plowing, and
other associated activities. In addition, modern oil and gas development has also had ground disturbing
impacts within portions of Area 4A. Subsurface pipelines proceed through Tracts 4A1, 4A4, and 4A5 and
a pad site is located within the southeastern extent of Tract 4A3 and the eastern portion of Tract 4A5
The most intensive ground disturbances have occurred within Tract 4A1 and were visible within historical
aerial photographs. From 1956 to 1962, the land within the tract was primarily used for pasture and
agricultural purposes. In 1963, the western quarter and northern third of the tract was completely modified
during the construction of a runway expansion for the Amon Carter Airfield. In addition, between 1970
and 1972 a portion of Big Bear Creek was relocated through the construction of a linear channel that
paralleled the northern boundary of Tract 4A1. Many portions of the northern and eastern extents of the
tract were drastically affected by this activity. When the DFW acquired the land within Tract 4A1, the
remaining portions of the tract were predominately cleared of vegetation and all structures were removed.
These disturbances were visually verified during the pedestrian survey and resulted in a drastically reduced
level of shovel testing and transect survey.
Pedestrian Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, Area 4A was investigated using 185 shovel tests, which
resulted in a sampling density of one shovel test per two acres. Of the 185 shovel tests, six were positive.
Seven sites were encountered within Area 4A. One of these was previously recorded, while the remaining
six are newly documented sites. Of the documented sites, one was classified as unknown prehistoric due
to the lack of diagnostics artifacts and the remaining five sites were classified as having historic-period
affiliation. As described above, Tract 4A1 was highly disturbed and was subjected to a reduced amount of
shovel testing. In addition, due to the high amount of disturbance within Tract 4A1, the tract had become
overgrown by extremely dense secondary growth that was prohibitive to transect survey. Based on the
information gathered during the background review and field observations, Tract 4A1 has an extremely low
potential for containing significant archeological sites with any form of subsurface preservation.
Based on the presence of historic-aged structures, four HRHPAs were developed within Area 4A. Three
of the four HRHPAs identified at the IES office were field verified as containing some evidence of historicperiod utilization. HRHPA 2 has been heavily disturbed and is presently utilized for dumping piles of dirt,
gravel, pallets, and tree debris (Appendix A, Photograph 1). The HRHPAâs totaled 63.27 acres and was
inventoried using transect survey and sampled through the excavation of 25 shovel tests. Two newly
recorded archeological sites (41TR290 and 41TR292) were encountered and recorded within the HRHPA
survey. The HRHPAs and their findings are summarized in Table 5.1. During the cultural investigation
within Area 4A, no structures of historic age were identified within the indirect APE that would require an
assessment of indirect effects.

41TR241
Previous Investigations
Site 41TR241 was first documented by GMI in May 2010. Original site records document the siteâs location
approximately 0.4-mile north of the intersection of the access road to SH 183 and Amon G. Carter
Boulevard. GMI documented five historic-period features; four of the five were identified as foundations
or structural remains with the fifth being a small depression. Artifacts recovered from the site included
glass, ceramics, tin cans, plastic, and various pieces of metal. The THC determined that site 41TR241 was
ineligible for inclusion as a NHRP or designation as a SAL in 2010.
Observations and Shovel Testing
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41TR241 was revisited to verify the siteâs presence and the previous
NRHP eligibility determination. During the survey conducted by IES, none of the five features identified
by GMI were encountered by IES.
The siteâs setting has changed since the GMI survey as a reclaimed pipeline has been constructed within
the western half of 41TR241âs boundary and vegetation was removed within other portions of the site.
These activities have created an extremely dense understory that was impenetrable within the majority of
the site (Appendix A, Photograph 2).
For these reasons, only four shovel tests were excavated by IES within the established site boundary. One
shovel test, JH126, was positive and contained a whiteware sherd and a window pane glass shard (Figure
5.1). Although the original features may be present today, no data gathered during the IES cultural
investigation was substantial or of a different nature than the GMI survey documented.
Summary
Site 41TR241 was a previously recorded historic-period site originally documented as containing five
features. Observations and shovel testing determined that 41TR241 was had been negatively affected by
ground disturbances since the GMI survey, which resulted in the destruction and/or removal of the
originally documented features. Although subsurface artifacts were encountered, their accumulation was
diffuse and of compromised provenance. As IES was able to assess the entirety of the site, the original
THC NRHP determination was verified.

41TR290
Site 41TR290 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 80 feet by 60 feet
along a north/south by west/east orientation (Appendix A, Photograph 3). The site was located along an
upland ridge 200 feet north of an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.2). The siteâs boundaries
were defined by the presence of a surface accumulation of historic-period artifacts dating to the mid-20th
century. Historical aerial photographs dating to 1942 depicted the site as being located within the margins
of a historic-period farmstead.
Disturbances
Historical maps dating to as early as 1942 illustrated the site was located along a residential road near the
margins of an active agricultural field. A 1956 aerial photograph on historicaerials.com depicted the site
located in proximity to a large barn and a smaller livestock enclosure. The livestock enclosure was
demolished between 1963 and 1968 and the barn was removed between 1970 and 1972. The ground within
and surrounding the site appeared to have been subjected to a variety of ground disturbances when
comparing aerial photographs from before demolition began to after the final structure was removed. Since
the demolition, the site has been left unmodified and become densely overgrown by primary and secondary
growth.
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, a variety of disturbances have occurred that have greatly reduced the potential for
encountering subsurface cultural deposits. When IES delineated 41TR290, the previously identified
disturbances were verified in the field through widespread surface undulation and push-piles. These
disturbances restrict the potential for subsurface deposits to the southernmost extent of the site. As such, a
single negative shovel test was excavated within the southern portion of the site. The shovel test revealed
a 10YR5/3 silty loamy clay extending from the surface to 30 cmbs and a culturally sterile 5YR5/4 loamy
clay extending below 30 cmbs.
Subsequently, the boundaries of 41TR290 were delineated through the presence of a low-density surface
scatter comprised of tin cans, a whiteware cup, an oil drum, unidentified metal, and glass bottles (Appendix
A, Photographs 4 and 5). A sample of diagnostic glass bottles was documented and is summarized in
Table 5.2 (Appendix A, Photographs 6 through 8).

Archival Research
Site 41TR290 was located within the John W. Thomas survey, which was patented on the 18th of January
1855. Using records from the Texas General Land Office (GLO) detailing the patenting of land to John W.
Thomas and Assessor Abstract of Rural Property Records (AARPR) obtained from the Tarrant County
Clerkâs Office (TCCO), a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR290 was generated (Table 5.3).
According to the AARPR, the site was located within a 30-acre parcel referred to as Tract 1C of the John

Additional resources reviewed included, the Samâs Street Map (SSM) of Tarrant County, drafted in the
December 1895, which depicted no structures located within the John W. Thomas survey abstract. A USGS
soil map from 1920 depicted two structures located adjacent to the boundaries of 41TR290.
Based on these records and the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR290
most likely pertains to the Wyche, Yarber, or McCutchin family ownership. None of the names presented
within the chain of title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or on The TxGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41TR290 was a newly recorded site containing the remnants of a historic-period farmstead. Due to the
highly disturbed setting with little potential for buried cultural deposits, only a single shovel test was
excavated within the site delineation, which did not yield any cultural materials. Overall, the site was
general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
41TR291
Site 41TR291 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 355 feet by 210 feet
along a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located within the margins of a dissected upland
setting adjacent to an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek, which was 250 feet to the south (Figure 5.3).
The siteâs boundaries were established by the presence of a surface accumulation of historic-period artifacts
and building materials dating to the mid-20th century. Historical aerial photographs dating to 1942
illustrated the site was located within the margins of a historic-period

farmstead within the present day footprint of SH 360. Using historical aerial photographs, no structures
were identified within the siteâs boundaries.
Disturbances
According to aerial photographs dating as early as 1942, the site was located within a modified wooded
area adjacent to a small pond. A residential structure and several outbuildings were identified between 200
and 500 feet west of the current site boundaries. A 1957 aerial photograph, observed on historicaerials.com,
also depicts what appears to be bladed or disturbed ground within and adjacent to the site boundaries. All
structures adjacent to 41TR291 were demolished between 1973 and 1979 after the DFW acquisition of the
property. Further disturbance of the farmstead occurred during the late 1980s with the construction of SH
360. A road was constructed that proceeded through the northern portion of the site to facilitate construction
efforts within the area. The site was further modified during the mid-2000s when vegetation was cleared
for a pathway that proceeded through the center of the site (Appendix A, Photograph 9).
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, the area has undergone ground disturbing activities since the early 1940s. When IES
delineated 41TR291, the previously identified disturbances were verified in the field through widespread
surface undulations and the presence of push-piles. The observed push-piles contained fence posts, barbed
wire, lumber, concrete aggregate, and nearby trees that had been cleared during demolition and the removal
of vegetation (Appendix A, Photographs 10 through 12). The push-piles were organized into large piles
that occupied the northern, western, southern, and central portions of the site. The eastern extent of the site
was located within a sloping setting that contained a âVâ-shaped contour that formed a minor drainage.
The historic-period artifacts were largely confined within the boundaries of the sloping drainage.
These disturbances restrict the potential for subsurface deposits within the site. As such, a single negative
shovel test was excavated within the southern portion of the site. The shovel test contained no cultural
materials and revealed the site contained shallow soils with an underlying hard pan clay soil. A 10YR4/4
sandy loam extended from the surface to 30 cmbs and a culturally sterile 7.5YR4/6 loamy clay was located
beneath 30 cmbs.
Subsequently, the boundaries of 41TR291 were delineated by the presence of push-piles containing
historical building debris and the low-density surface scatter comprised of pieces of wire fencing, metal
cans, bricks, plastic fragments, metal cans, pvc pipe, aerosol cans, sheet metal fragments, and gas cans
(Appendix A, Photograph 13).
Archival Research
Site 41TR291 was located within the Isham Crowley survey, which was patented on the 5th of October
1854. Using records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to Isham Crowley and the AARPR,
obtained from the TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR291 was generated (Table
5.4). According to the AARPR the site was located within a 50-acre parcel referred to as Tract 6 of the
Isham Crowley survey.

The SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in December 1895, depicted a single structure labeled âDr. Dobkinâs
Placeâ near the location of 41TR291. A USGS soil map from 1920 depicted a single structure located west
of the siteâs boundaries. The AARPR indicate that the first structure constructed within Tract 6 dated to
1880 and three additional structures were constructed in 1930.
Dr. William Calloway Dobkins was born on November 11, 1842 in Tennessee. Mr. Dobkins served in the
Confederate Army Company K of the 7th Cavalry and was captured on April 15, 1863 and held at Bayou
Teche, Louisiana. A. S. (Aline Smyth) Dobkins was born the daughter of Dr. William Calloway Dobkins
on 9th of December 1893. Aline died on the 9th of November 1978. However, based on these records and
the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR291 most likely pertains to the
F.K. Travis family ownership. None of the names presented within the chain of title were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online or on The TxGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41TR291 was a newly recorded site that contained the remnants of a historic-period farmstead. The
majority of the site was located outside the APE and within the footprint of SH 360. Due to the highly
disturbed setting with little potential for buried cultural deposits, only a single shovel test was excavated
within the site, which did not yield any cultural materials. Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed
horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological
record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
41TR292
Site 41TR292 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 2,475 feet by 835 feet
along a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located within gently sloping upland setting that
contains the sloping hillside leading to an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.4). The siteâs
boundaries were established by the presence of six features that included four foundations, trash deposit,
and a road. In addition, a low-density surface scatter was located within the northwestern portion of the
site. According to a 1942 historical aerial photograph, a road proceeded along a general north/south
orientation through the site and connected to what is now SH 183. Several large warehouse and/or barn
structures were located adjacent to the road and several smaller outbuildings dotted the landscape. In
addition, several maintained agricultural fields were adjacent to the road. A residence and associated
outbuildings were identified on historical aerial photographs within the southernmost extent of the site.
Through referenced aerial photographs, 41TR292 was determined to pertain to a large complex containing
both residential and agricultural/pastoral components.
Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs depicted the presence of the complex dating as early as 1942. Subsequent
aerial photographs illustrated little change between 1942 to the mid-1970s. During the 1970s, the DFW
purchased the land and demolished all of the structures. After the mid-1970s, the agricultural fields were
no longer maintained and early succession vegetation covered the features and fields.
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, a few disturbances have occurred that have reduced the potential for encountering
subsurface cultural deposits. When IES delineated 41TR292, the previously identified disturbances were
verified in the field. Small push-piles of cleared vegetation and building materials were located within the
northern portion of the site.
Sixteen shovel tests were excavated within the site with only one testing positive for cultural materials.
Positive shovel test (KS24) yielded a clear ribbed glass shard from approximately 0 to 20 cmbs. Shovel
testing across the site revealed a 10YR5/4 sandy loam that ranged from the surface to 40 cmbs and a
culturally sterile 7.5YR4/6 sandy clay loam extended below 40 cmbs.

approximately 20 feet by 25 feet along the eastern portion of the building. In addition, a cemented entrance
or platform extended 25 feet by 10 feet from the southern portion of the building (Appendix A, Photograph
16). A steel railing was located around the inner perimeter of the building foundation. The site contained
a low-density ephemeral artifact scatter that was concentrated within the northwestern portion of the site.
The artifact scatter was very disbursed and consisted of metal pails and buckets, metal scraps, and small
push-piles of concrete aggregate, asphalt, and lumber (Appendix A, Photographs 14 and 15).
Features
Six features were identified within site 41TR292. Features 1 through 4 were foundations associated with
complex. Feature 5 was a historical trash deposit and Feature 6 was the historical road that provided access
to the other features. Feature 1 was located within the western portion of the site and consisted of the
foundation of a small building approximately 70 feet by 25 feet in size. The remnants of an additional room
extended appears the structure functioned as a loading dock. Six small 1 by 1 foot rebar reinforced concrete
pillars were located within the center of the building (Appendix A, Photograph 17). A brick pile was
located 10 feet north of the structure and several plastic crates were observed around the periphery of the
feature. Other artifacts observed consisted of bricks, metal pipes, and fragments of sheet metal.
Feature 2 was located within the southwestern portion of the site and consisted of the foundation of a large
building approximately 180 feet by 50 feet. The feature was located 375 feet south of Feature 1. The
building was divided into six rooms that were separated by the remnants of the concrete wall. The most
western room contained a red pavement foundation with a series of three stairs that connected it with the
entranceway area (Appendix A, Photograph 18). The entranceway area extended 10 feet by 75 feet and
was south of the three central rooms (Appendix A, Photograph 19). The central-western room was two
to three feet below the entranceway and was filled by bricks and other building materials (Appendix A,
Photograph 20). The central room was six to eight feet below a raised platform and contained bricks,
mattress springs, a refrigerator, a stove, pipes, a furnace, and scrap metal. A two foot by two foot cement
pillar was located within the center of the room (Appendix A, Photograph 21). The central-eastern room
was four to five feet below the entranceway and filled with bricks. The easternmost room was largely clear
of debris and only contained a few bricks (Appendix A, Photograph 22). The northernmost room was
outlined by the remnants of the wall and was level with the surface. Small ventilation covers were located
along the outer portion of the foundation and several brick roof columns had collapsed and fallen south of
the building (Appendix A, Photograph 23). Other artifacts observed throughout the site consisted of
hundreds of mostly unstamped bricks. A few of the bricks were stamped and four types were identified
and described in Table 5.5 (Graves 2012).

10 feet to the south.
Feature 4 was located within the eastern portion of the site and consisted of the concrete pieces of a
demolished foundation. The feature was located 500 feet northeast of Feature 3. Three large slabs with
scars from heavy machinery were partially buried beneath the surface (Appendix A, Photograph 25). The
remnants of a barbed wire fence were located 50 feet to the south and a 15 by 10 foot stock pond was
located 30 feet to the southwest (Appendix A, Photograph 26).
Feature 5 was located within the northeastern portion of the site and consisted of a historical trash deposit.
The feature was located 475 feet north of the Feature 4. The trash deposit was scattered over an area
extending 330 feet by 210 feet and most densely concentrated within the center. It appears during the
demolition of a nearby building, household artifacts and building materials were deposited within a minor
drainage. The artifacts were partially buried and consisted of glass bottles, tin cans, large kitchen
appliances, oil drums, tires, a stoneware jug, mattress box springs, and miscellaneous scrap metal
(Appendix A, Photograph 27). A sample of diagnostic glass bottles was documented and is described in
Table 5.6.

Feature 6 consisted of the historical road that proceeded through the site (Appendix A, Photographs 29
and 30). The road formed a general â Ò â-shape and entered from the southern portion of the site and exited
through the northern portion. The road was constructed of asphalt and was generally obscured by prairie
grasses and other vegetation; however, small portions and patches were observed within the southern
portion of the site.
Archival Research
Site 41TR292 was located within the Abraham Barnard survey, which was patented on 22 May 1854. Using
records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to A. Barnard and the AARPR, obtained from the
TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR292 was generated (Table 5.7). According to
the AARPR the site was located within an 82-acre parcel referred to as Tract 4 of the Abraham Barnard
survey.

Additional resources reviewed included, the SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in the December of 1895,
which depicted a single, unlabeled structure near the northern extent of 41TR292. A USGS soil map from
1920 did not depict any structure located with or adjacent to the site.
Based on these records and the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR292
most likely pertains to the Dearing family ownership. None of the names presented within the chain of title
were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or on The TxGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41TR292 was a newly recorded historic-period residential and agricultural/pastoral complex consisting
of six features and a low-density artifact scatter. The site was located within an area that had structures
present during the mid-20th century until the mid-1970s. When the buildings and structures were
demolished, artifacts and building materials were disbursed over a large area and became obscured by
vegetation through time. Sixteen shovel tests were excavated within the site and the single positive shovel
test yielded on glass shard. . Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical
disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an
association to a significant historical person or event.

41TR293
Site 41TR293 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 190 feet by 70 feet
along a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located upon the sideslopes of an upland feature
that was adjacent to an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.5). The siteâs boundaries were
established by the presence of a surface accumulation of artifacts dating to the mid-20th century. According
to historical aerial photographs the site was located within a cleared area, approximately 100 feet north of
a maintained agricultural field and no structures were observed in proximity. 93
Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs dating to as early as 1942 illustrated the site was located within a modified
and partially wooded area adjacent to a residential road. The site was located within a small ravine within
a larger historical farmstead identified completely through historical aerial photographs. After 1970, the
area was no longer maintained and primary and secondary growth reclaimed the area. The area was further
modified when a ROW was constructed just north of the site between 1990 and 1995. It appears during the
demolition of nearby buildings that artifacts and building materials were deposited within a minor drainage.

Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, the area has undergone disturbances dating to the early 1940s. When IES delineated
the site, the previously identified disturbances were verified in the field through widespread surface
undulations. It appears during the demolition of the nearby structures that artifacts and building materials
were deposited within the minor drainage. Due to the significant disturbances within the area no shovel
tests were excavated within the site boundary. However, a single shovel test was excavated 25 feet to the
west to the site and revealed the area contained a 10YR5/4 sandy clay loam that extended from the surface
to 30 cmbs and a culturally sterile 7.5YR5/8 loamy clay that extended below 30 cmbs.
The historic-aged trash deposit consisted of tin cans, oil drums, wooden boards, glass bottles, bricks, tires,
wire fencing, and window glass (Appendix A, Photographs 31 and 32). A sample of diagnostic artifacts
was documented and included seven glass bottles and a toy gun (Table 5.8) (Appendix A, Photographs
33 and 34). The toy cap gun was made by Nichols Industries, Inc. and operated from 1946 to 1965 in
Pasadena and Jacksonville, Texas (Appendix A, Photograph 35).

Site 41TR293 was located within the Abraham Barnard survey, which was patented on 22 May 1854. Using
records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to A. Barnard and the AARPR, obtained from the
TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR293 was generated (Table 5.9). According to
the AARPR the site was located within a 79.2-acre parcel referred to as Tract 1 of the A. Barnard survey.
Additional resources reviewed included, the SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in the December 1895, which
depicted a single, unlabeled structure near the northern extent of 41TR293. A USGS soil map from 1920
did not depict any structure located within or adjacent to the site. Although no structures were observed on
historical aerials or maps, AARPR indicated that a two-story brick house, a storage building, tool shed, and
several other ancillary buildings were constructed as early as 1920. As the chain of title is listed exactly

Summary
Site 41TR293 was a newly recorded site that contained a historic-aged trash deposit. Due to artifacts being
confined within a drainage, no shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary. . Overall, the site was
general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
41TR296
Site 41TR296 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 80 feet by 80 feet
along a north/south to west/east orientation. The site was located along the terrace of an unnamed tributary
of Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.6). The siteâs boundaries were established by the presence of a surface
accumulation of artifacts and building materials dating to the mid-20th century. According to aerial
photographs dating to the mid-1950s the site was located within a modified setting.
Disturbances
Historical maps dating to as early as 1942 illustrated the site was located adjacent to a fenceline and was
largely cleared of vegetation. The northern portion of the site contained a few large trees associated with
the riparian corridor of the unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (Appendix A, Photograph 36). A road
was constructed 15 feet south of the site between 1958 and 1963 and proceeded along a general west/east
direction. The road was no longer maintained between 1979 and 1990 and vegetation began reclaiming the
area. Further disturbance of the area occurred south and east of the site when an electrical ROW was
constructed between 1990 and 1995. Modern trash consisting of alcohol bottles and metal cans were
observed intermixed with the historic-period debris.
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, a variety of disturbances have occurred that have greatly reduced the potential for
encountering subsurface cultural deposits. When IES delineated 41TR290, the previously identified

disturbances were verified in the field. A small push-pile of historic-aged building debris was concentrated
within the center of the site.
Due to the significant disturbances that occurred within the area, the potential for subsurface deposits within
the site were reduced. As such, only a single shovel test was excavated within the site boundary and resulted
in no cultural materials. The shovel test revealed a disturbed palimpsest that contained a 10YR4/4 gravelly
sandy clay from the surface to 15 cmbs and a culturally sterile 7.5YR5/4 clay soil extending below 15 cmbs.
The site contained a low-density scatter of surficial artifacts and building materials. Artifacts observed on
the surface consisted of non-descript bricks and brick fragments, asphalt roof shingles, metal cans, glass
bottles, concrete pieces, cloth, and plastic trash (Appendix A, Photographs 37 and 38). In addition,
modern artifacts including alcohol bottles and metal cans were observed intermixed with the historic-period
debris.
Archival Research
Site 41TR296 was located within the Abraham Barnard survey, which was patented on 22 May 1854. Using
records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to Abraham Barnard and the AARPR, obtained from
the TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR296 was generated (Table 5.10). According
to the AARPR the site was located within a 79.2-acre parcel referred to as Tract 1 of the Abraham Barnard
survey.

Additional resources reviewed included, the SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in the December of 1895,
which depicted a single, unlabeled structure near the northern extent of 41TR295. A USGS soil map from
1920 did not depict any structure located within or adjacent to the site. Although no structures were
observed on historical aerials or maps, AARPR indicated that a two-story brick house, a storage building,

Summary
Site 41TR296 was a newly recorded site containing the remnants of historic-period artifacts and building
materials. Although no structures were located in proximity, the site was located within the boundaries of
a historical farmstead as verified on historical aerial photographs. Due to the highly disturbed setting
containing little potential for buried cultural deposits, only one shovel test was excavated during the site
delineation, which did not yield any cultural materials. Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed
horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological
record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
41TR297
Site 41TR297 was a newly recorded prehistoric site that extended approximately 25 m by 40 m (80 feet by
130 feet) along a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located within the margins of a dissected
upland setting 175 m (575 feet) southeast of an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.7)
(Appendix A, Photographs 39 and 40). The siteâs boundaries were established by the presence of a
subsurface accumulation of lithic debitage dating to an unknown prehistoric period.
Disturbances
Historical maps dating to as early as 1942 illustrated the site was located within a terraced agricultural field.
The area continued to be utilized for agricultural purposes until the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1979, the
field was no longer maintained and no further disturbances occurred within the site boundary. While
delineating the site, an agricultural terrace was identified along the western boundary of the site along a
general north/south orientation. In addition, a modern trail had been cleared and paralleled the agricultural
terrace (Appendix A, Photograph 41).
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, significant disturbances have occurred that have reduced the potential for
encountering intact subsurface deposits. When IES delineated the site, the previously identified
disturbances were verified in the field. A few agricultural terraces were observed while conducting
transects within the area and one was identified within the site. Due to the ground disturbing activities
associated with creating agricultural terraces and the cleared pathway, no shovel tests were excavated west
of the original positive shovel test. In addition, the boundary of the APE limited the amount of shovel test
excavated to the north.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated during the delineation of the site. Ten of the shovel tests were negative
and the three positive shovel tests each contained a secondary quartzite flake. All of the artifacts were
found between the surface and 20 cmbs. The shovel tests revealed a 10YR5/4 loam clay that extended from
the surface to 40 cmbs and a culturally sterile 7.5YR4/6 clay that extended below 40 cmbs.
Summary
Site 41TR297 was a newly recorded ephemeral prehistoric scatter of lithic debitage dating to an unknown
prehistoric period. The site was located within a terraced agricultural field. Thirteen shovel tests, including
three positive shovel tests, were excavated during the delineation of the site. The shovel tests contained
three small, less than five centimeters in length, secondary quartzite flakes. Overall, the site was general in
nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas
archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.
Alexander Dobkins Cemetery
The Alexander Dobkins Cemetery was originally part of a 200-acre farm owned by Alexander Dobkins,
who moved in the area in 1852. Alexander Dobkins was ordained as a minister in the nearby Bear Creek
Baptist Church and served as a postmaster for the community of Estelle. The cemetery contains the graves
of seven members of the Dobkins family, the earliest dating to 1869.

The closest portion of the cemetery to the APE was located approximately 150 feet west of Tract 4A5
(Figure 5.8). A previous cemetery assessment, conducted by the THC, documented six headstones during
a countywide survey in 2004. During the IES revisit of the cemetery, seven rather than six headstones were
observed. IES observed similar conditions as documented in 2004 with the cemetery surrounded by woven
and barbed wire fencing, being located behind a locked DFW gate, and unmaintained. Although no signs
of recent vandalism were observed, one headstone was broken and a large tree had recently fallen over and
covered several headstones (Attachment A, Photograph 49). None of the gravestones were damaged;
however, if the tree is not cleared, future storms could further displace branches and it could affect the
gravestones.
During the visual assessment surrounding the cemetery and within the western portion of Tract 4A5, no
depressions or other evidence were observed that indicated graves were located outside the current cemetery
fence. The cemetery fencing extended approximately 110 feet by 120 feet along a northeast/southwest by
northwest/southeast orientation. Surface visibility was restricted by dense vegetation and foliage along the
north and south sides of the cemetery. An existing 25-foot wide natural gas pipeline easement is located
directly east of the cemetery. A 25-foot wide cleared corridor along the DFW boundary fence was located
west of the cemetery.
Although the current boundaries of the cemetery were denoted by fencing during the IES survey, the
boundaries have not been established through archival research. Through coordination with the THC, it
was determined that unmarked graves could be located outside the current cemetery boundaries. As such,
a 150-foot non-development buffer was created surrounding the cemetery and the APE modified to increase
the distance between the cemetery and proposed development.
Bear Creek Cemetery
The Bear Creek Cemetery was developed adjacent to the site of Bear Creek Missionary Baptist Church,
which was organized in 1853. The four acre burial ground was donated by Isham Crowley, an original
member of Peters Colony, and was deeded to church trustees in 1876.
The closest portion of the cemetery to the APE was located approximately 150 feet north of Tract 4A2
(Figure 5.9). A previous cemetery assessment, conduct by the THC, detailed the cemetery was mapped on
the USGS topographic quad, active, maintained, fully fenced, and had a low degree of endangerment during
a countywide survey in 2004. IES observed similar conditions as documented in 2004 with the cemetery
containing a graveled pathway leading from the western gated entrance to the center. The graveled pathway
encircles the central and eastern portions of the cemetery. The earliest gravestone dates to December 1858
and there are approximately 500 historical and modern graves. The oldest graves are concentrated within
the northwestern portion within the encircled pathway (Attachment A, Photograph 50).
During the visual assessment surrounding the cemetery and within the northern portion of Tract 4A2, no
depressions or other evidence were observed that indicated graves were located outside the current cemetery
fence. The cemetery extended approximately 525 feet by 505 feet along a north/south by west/east
orientation. Surface visibility was restricted by dense vegetation and foliage along the south side of the
cemetery closest to the APE. Although the oldest graves were within the central portion of the cemetery,
through coordination with the THC, it was determined that there was still potential for unmarked graves to
be located outside the current cemetery boundaries. As such, a 150-foot non-development buffer was
created surrounding the cemetery and the APE modified to increase the distance between the cemetery and
proposed development.

Isolated Artifacts
Isolated finds consisted of less than five artifacts found within a 10 m radius. In the situation that an isolated
artifact occurs, a thorough surface examination takes places within a 30 m radius.
Isolated Find 1 (IF1)
IF1 was located 75 m west of 41TR292 and was located upon a moderately sloping upland ridge
overlooking Big Bear Creek. A single petrified wood flake was documented during the excavation of a
shovel test (JH112). An additional eight shovel tests were excavated to the north, south, east, and west of
the positive shovel test. All shovel tests were negative for cultural material. A thorough examination of
the area revealed no obvious disturbances and no artifacts observed on the surface.

5.2 NW Bear Creek (Area 4B)
Overview
Area 4B consisted of two tracts (4B1 and 4B2) that totaled 115.7 acres. The two tracts were located along
SH 360, north of East Mid Cities Boulevard, and adjacent to East Glade Road. Both of the tracts are within
Tarrant County. Overall, tracts within Area 4B were comprised of a rolling upland setting paralleling Big
Bear Creek.
Field Observations
Tracts within Area 4B were primarily characterized by dense mixed woods with an understory containing
extremely thick accumulations of brier, vine, and sapling within a rolling upland setting. Vegetative and
soil observation confirmed the entirety of Area 4B was located within environmental Zone 2. Historically,
the northern portion of Area 4B was primarily utilized for agricultural purposes and has been affected by
associated ground disturbing activities. The southern portion of Area 4B has generally remained
undeveloped and maintained densely-wooded areas until the present. Modern oil and gas development has
also impacted areas within Area 4B. Subsurface pipelines proceed through tracts 4B1 and 4B2 and a pad
site is located within the southern portion of tract 4B2.
The most intensive ground disturbances have occurred within the northern portion of Area 4B and were
visible within historical aerial photographs. Prior to 1942 through the early 1970s, the area was historically
utilized for agricultural and pastoral purposes. When the DFW acquired the land within Area 4B, portions
of the area were predominately cleared of vegetation and all structures were removed. These disturbances
were visually verified during the pedestrian survey and resulted in a drastically reduced level of shovel
testing and transect survey.
Pedestrian Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, the area was investigated using 95 shovel tests, which
resulted in a sampling density of one shovel test per 0.82-acre. Of the 95 shovel tests, one was positive.
Three sites were encountered within Area 4B. One of these sites was previously recorded, while the
remaining two have been newly documented. Of the documented sites, two were classified as having
historic-period affiliation.
In addition, four HRHPAs were developed within Area 4B. None of the four HRHPAs identified at the
IES office were field verified as containing any cultural evidence. The HRHPAâs totaled 23.65 acres and
was inventoried using transect survey and sampled through the excavation of 26 shovel tests. In addition,
one previously recorded site (41TR82) was revisited. The HRHPAs and their findings are summarized in
Table 5.11. During the cultural investigation within Area 4A, no structures of historic age were identified
within the indirect APE that would require an assessment of indirect effects.

Encountered Cultural Resources
41TR82
This site was originally documented by the University of Texas at Austin during a survey in 1982. It was
described as being a multiple component site containing both prehistoric and historic-age materials. The
site was described as being along the southern terrace of Big Bear Creek and 200 m north of Glade Road
(Figure 5.10). The prehistoric component consisted of a lithic scatter containing 20 flakes, debitage, and
a fire-cracked rock. The historic-period materials included the concrete foundations of a former house and
the associated household artifacts including: glass, whiteware sherds, concrete debris, and asphalt chunks
(Prikryl 1982).
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41TR82 was revisited to reassess the siteâs NRHP eligibility status.
The TASA database provided a site centroid for the site and a field map that was made during the 1982
survey. The 1982 field map did not transcribe well to digital format and many of the handwritten notes
remain indecipherable. The site boundaries depicted within the field map was much larger than the
boundaries established by IES. The IES site boundary was established by the presence of cultural materials
found within the shovel test and surface. At the time of the 1982 survey, it was recorded that the site had
undergone significant disturbances. It appears disturbances have continued to the present and further
disturbed the context of any cultural materials. Many areas that had been cleared of vegetation during the
past now have extremely thick accumulations of green brier, vine, and other early successional vegetation.
In addition, gas and oil development have affected areas within the field site made in 1982. During the
survey conducted by IES, 12 shovel tests were excavated within or near the site centroid provided by TASA
and one shovel test was positive. The positive shovel test contained a quartzite flake that was located
between the surface and 20 cmbs. In addition, a single quartzite flake was observed along the bare surface
of the nearby dirt two-track road.
41TR294
Site 41TR294 was a newly recorded historic-period site that extended approximately 75 feet by 100 feet
along a north/south by west/east orientation. The site was located along a dissected upland ridge west of
Big Bear Creek (Figure 5.11). The siteâs boundaries were established by the presence of a surface
accumulation of artifacts dating to the mid-20th century. Historical aerial photographs dating to the mid1950s illustrated the site was located within a densely forested area, approximately 75 feet south of a
maintained agricultural field.
Disturbances
According to a historical aerial photograph dating to 1942, the site was located within a densely forested
area approximately 100 feet south of a maintained agricultural field. A cleared pathway led south from the

agricultural field through the western extent of the site and lead to a small cleared area west of the site.
Subsequent aerial photographs indicated the pathway was utilized as a two-track road to access areas to the
south. The pathway fell into disuse after 1979 and the area was left undisturbed until SH 360 was
constructed between 1995 and 2001. In addition, a two track road was constructed between 1979 and 1980
100 feet north of the site to facilitate the construction of SH 360. Modern debris and trash associated with
camping were found within the site and intermixed with the historic-aged artifacts.
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, significant disturbances have occurred that have reduced the potential for
encountering intact subsurface deposits. When IES delineated the site, the previously identified
disturbances were verified in the field by the presence of a push-pile containing cleared vegetation and
modern artifacts intermixed with historic-aged artifacts. Due to the significant disturbances that have
occurred within and adjacent to the site, no shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary. However,
a shovel test was excavated 50 feet to the west of the site and another was excavated 150 feet to the east.
The shovel tests conducted within the vicinity of the site revealed a 10YR5/2 loamy clay extending from
the surface to 40 cmbs and a culturally sterile 10YR 4/3 loamy clay extending below 40 cmbs.
The site contained a low-density scatter of surficial artifacts and building materials. The artifacts observed
consisted of glass bottles, metal cans, plastics, a whiteware creamer, tires, oil drums, clothing, shoes,
wooden boards, and carpeting (Appendix A, Photographs 42 and 43). Among the artifacts observed, a
sample of five diagnostic glass bottles were documented and are described in Table 5.12 (Appendix A,
Photographs 44 and 45).
Archival Research
Site 41TR294 was located within the Samuel Tucker survey, which was patented on 07 April 1856. Using
records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to S. Tucker and the AARPR, obtained from the
TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR294 was generated (Table 5.13). According to
the AARPR the site was located within a 59.5-acre parcel referred to as Tract 3 of the S. Tucker survey.

Additional resources reviewed included, the SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in the December 1895, which
depicted a single structure in proximity to 41TR294 labeled âM. Rodgers.â A USGS soil map from 1920
did not depict any structure located with or adjacent to the site.
Based on these records and the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR294
most likely pertains to the Pool Trust Ownership. None of the names presented within the chain of title
were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or on The TxGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41TR294 was a newly recorded scatter of historic-period artifacts and building materials. Although
no structures were located nearby, the site was located within a close vicinity to the historical boundaries
of a historic-period farmstead. Due to the disturbed setting and nature of the site, no shovel tests were
excavated within the site boundary. Overall, the site was general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical
disturbance, was well represented within the North-Central Texas archeological record, and lacked an
association to a significant historical person or event.
41TR295
Site 41TR295 was a newly recorded scatter of historic-period artifacts that extended 60 feet by 40 feet along
a north/south to west/east direction. The site was located along the sideslopes of a gently sloping upland
setting (Figure 5.12). The siteâs boundaries were established by the presence of a surface accumulation of
artifacts and building materials dating to the mid-20th century. According to aerial photographs dating to
1942, the site is located along the boundary of a maintained agricultural field and a densely forested area.
Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs, dating to as early as 1942, illustrated the site was located partially within a
terraced agricultural field and a densely forested area (Appendix A, Photograph 46). An agricultural
terrace proceeded through the central and eastern portions of the site. The agricultural field was no longer
maintained after the mid-1970s and early successional vegetation covered the area. The area remained
unmodified until the late 1980s when the access road to SH 360 was constructed 200 feet west of the site.
Shovel Testing and Observations
As mentioned above, portions of the site have been exposed to disturbances that have reduced the potential
for encountering subsurface cultural deposits. When IES delineated the site, the previously identified
disturbances, primarily those associated with agricultural activities, were observed.
Due to the disturbances observed within the site, only a single shovel test was excavated and resulted in no
cultural materials. The shovel test revealed a 10YR5/4 sandy loamy clay extending from the surface to 30
cmbs and a culturally sterile 7.5YR4/6 loamy clay extending below 30 cmbs.
The site contained a low-density, surficial scatter of non-diagnostic household debris and building
materials. The artifacts were confined to the âVâ-shaped contours that formed a very minor drainage. Most
of the artifacts were very fragmented and consisted of glass shards, bricks and brick fragments, tiles, plastic
fragments, metal cans, barbed wire pieces and posts, and metal fragments (Appendix A, Photograph 47
and 48). No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
Archival Research
Site 41TR295 was located within the Patrick Everard survey, which was patented on 09 December 1854.
Using records from the GLO detailing the patenting of land to Patrick Everard and the AARPR obtained
from the TCCO, a chain of title for the property encompassing 41TR295 was generated (Table 5.14).
According to the AARPR the site was located within a 14.67-acre parcel referred to as Tract 6 of the Patrick
Everard survey.

Additional resources reviewed included the SSM of Tarrant County, drafted in the December 1895, which
depicted no structures in proximity to 41TR295. A USGS soil map from 1920 did not depict any structure
located with or adjacent to the site.
Based on these records and the artifacts encountered during the IES archeological delineation, site 41TR295
most likely pertains to the Murray family ownership. None of the names presented within the chain of title
were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online or on The TxGenWeb Project website.
Summary
Site 41TR295was a newly recorded historic-aged scatter of artifacts and building materials. Although no
structures were located nearby, the site was located within the historical boundaries of a historical
farmstead. Due to the disturbed setting with little potential for subsurface cultural deposits, only a single
shovel test was excavated within the site, which did not yield any cultural materials. Overall, the site was
general in nature, displayed horizontal and vertical disturbance, was well represented within the NorthCentral Texas archeological record, and lacked an association to a significant historical person or event.

5.3 NE Bear Creek (Area 4C)
Overview
NE Bear Creek consisted of seven tracts (4C1 through 4C7) that totaled 180.5 acres. The tracts were
bounded by West Airfield Drive to the east and Bear Creek Golf Club to the south and west. All of the
tracts are within Tarrant County. Overall, Area 4C lies within an upland setting that is dissected by several
unnamed tributaries of Big Bear Creek. Although Tracts 4C2 and 4C7 were part of Tranche 4, these tracts
had been previously inventoried for cultural resources under Texas Antiquities Permits #6853 and #7126.
As discussed in Section 3.1, a majority of Area 4C has been previously surveyed for cultural resources. As
such, a reduced level of shovel testing and transect survey was conducted within these areas.
Field Observations
Tracts 4C1 and 4C3 were primarily comprised of densely covered forests while Tracts 4C4, 4C5, and 4C6
had been cleared of vegetation. Vegetative and soil observation confirmed the majority of Area 4C is
located within environmental Zone 2. Parts of Tracts 4C1 and 4C3 are located within the Zone 3 Bear
Creek floodplain. Historically, the majority of land within Area 4C was utilized for agricultural purposes
and ground disturbing activities would include the clearing of vegetation, modifying the land to create
agricultural terraces, plowing, and other associated activities. In addition, modern oil and gas development
has also had ground disturbing impacts within 4C3 and 4C4.
The most intensive ground disturbances have occurred within Tract 4C6 and are visible within historical
aerial photographs. From as early as 1942 to 1979, Tract 4C6 was utilized as a cultivated and terraced field.
The area has been continually maintained since 1979 to the present day. Based on the information gathered

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 245

during background review combined with field observations, Tract 4C6 has an extremely low potential for
containing significant archeological sites with any form of subsurface preservation.
Pedestrian Survey
Using the methodology outlined in Chapter 4.1, three HRHPAs were developed within Area 4C. All tracts
within 4C were at least partly surveyed previously. One of the three HRHPAs identified at the IES office
was field verified as containing cultural material. The HRHPAs totaled 21.69 acres and were inventoried
using transect survey and sampled through the excavation of 15 shovel tests. There were no new sites
encountered within the HRHPAs. In addition, three previously recorded sites (41TR17, 41TR18, and
41TR20) were revisited to reassess the NRHP eligibility status. The HRHPAs and their findings are
summarized in Table 5.15. During the cultural investigation within Area 4A, no structures of historic age
were identified within the indirect APE that would require an assessment of indirect effects.

Encountered Cultural Resources
41TR17
Previous Investigations
This site was originally documented during the 1979 survey conducted by the Texas Department of Water
Resources (TDWR). It was described as being a single component site containing prehistoric materials.
The site was located on a sandstone bluff east of Big Bear Creek and west of Jackson Road. The prehistoric
component consisted of a low-density lithic scatter containing debitage. It was reported that a majority of
the debitage was found in or adjacent to gopher mounds (Whitsett and Fox 1979). In 2011, the THC
determined 41TR17 was ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a SAL.
Observations and Shovel Testing
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41TR17 was revisited to verify the siteâs presence and the THCâs
NRHP eligibility determination. The site boundaries provided by the TASA extended outside the APE
(Figure 5.13). As such, the cultural investigation was limited to documenting areas within the boundaries
of the APE, totaling approximately 8.9 acres.
It was determined, prior to fieldwork, that the area had undergone significant disturbances. According to
historical aerial photographs dating to as early as 1942, the area was primarily utilized for
agricultural/pastoral purposes. After the acquisition of the property by the DFW, the area was no longer
maintained and early successional vegetation covered the site. In 2005, a ROW was constructed through
the northern portion of the site along a northwest/southeast orientation.
Apparent subsurface disturbances and APE limitations allowed for six shovel tests to be excavated within
an 8.9-acre portion of the site. A single positive shovel test, AG27, was excavated and contained a single
quartzite flake at approximately 0-20 cmbs.

Summary
Site 41TR17 was a previously recorded prehistoric site originally documented as low-density scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage. Observations and shovel testing determined that the portion of 41TR17 within
the APE has been negatively affected by modern ground disturbances. Although the site has a subsurface
component, the artefactual accumulation was diffuse and of compromised provenance. However, as IES
was unable to assess the entirety of the site, the THC NRHP determination could not be verified.
41TR18
Previous Investigations
This site was originally documented during the 1979 survey conducted by the TDWR. It was described as
being a multiple component site containing both prehistoric and historic-age materials. The site was located
east of Big Bear Creek and west of Jackson Road. The prehistoric component was described as artifacts
associated with lithic procurement activities. The historical component consisted of names, initials, and
dates being carved into a sandstone outcrop above the creek (Whitsett and Fox 1979). In 2008, the THC
determined 41TR18 was ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a SAL.
Observations and Shovel Testing
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41TR18 was revisited to verify the siteâs presence and the THCâs
NRHP eligibility determination. The site boundaries provided by the TASA extended outside the APE.
(Figure 5.14) As such, the cultural investigation was limited to documenting areas within the boundaries
of the APE, totaling approximately 15.6 acres. According to aerial photographs dating back to as early

as 1942, that the northern portion of the site was utilized primarily for agricultural purposes and southern
part was within a densely forested area.
During the survey conducted by IES, nine negative shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary
provided by TASA. No artifacts were observed on the groundâs surface or within any excavated shovel
test within the sites boundaries. No sandstone outcrop that could contain historic-aged graffiti was observed
during the survey.
Summary
Site 41TR18 was a previously recorded multiple-component site originally documented as containing
prehistoric lithic artifacts and historic-aged graffiti. Observations and shovel testing determined that
41TR18 was not encountered during the IES survey. APE limitations prevented a reassessment within the
siteâs entire boundary, which could contain prehistoric and historic-aged cultural materials. However, as
IES was unable to assess the entirety of the site, the THC NRHP determination could not be verified.
41TR20
Previous Investigations
This site was originally documented during the 1979 survey conducted by the TDWR. It was described as
being a multiple component site containing both prehistoric and historic-age materials. The site was located
between Big Bear Creek and an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek. The prehistoric component consisted
of a scatter of lithic debitage, a burned rock, and a large thinned biface fragment. The historic-age
components are associated with a residential building that was noted on historical aerial photographs dating
to the mid-1950s (Whitsett and Fox 1979).
Observations and Shovel Testing
As part of the 2015 IES survey, site 41TR20 was revisited to verify the siteâs presence. The site boundaries
provided by the TASA extended outside the APE (Figure 5.15). As such, the cultural investigation was
limited to documenting areas within the boundaries of the APE, totaling approximately 3.3 acres. Of the
approximate 3.3-acres of 41TR20 within the APE, approximately 2.2-acres were located within the
footprint of a previously conducted archeological survey or within a highly disturbed setting containing a
concrete road and borrow ditches. The remaining 1.1 acres was surveyed by IES.
According to historical aerial photographs dating to as early as 1942, the area was primarily utilized for
agricultural purposes. After the acquisition of the property by the DFW, the historical farmstead and
outlying structures were demolished. Between 1979 and 1990, a road was constructed through the site
along a north/south orientation.
Due to the disturbances that occurred within the site and a portion being previously surveyed, only four
shovel tests were excavated during the IES survey. No artifacts were observed on the groundâs surface or
within any excavated shovel test within the sites boundaries.
Summary
Site 41TR20 was a previously recorded multiple-component site originally documented as containing
prehistoric lithic debitage, burned rock, and fragmented tools, and historic-aged construction debris from a
former residential building. Observations and shovel testing determined that 41TR20 was not encountered
during the IES survey. APE limitations prevented a reassessment within the siteâs entire boundary, which
could contain prehistoric and historic-aged cultural materials. As IES was unable to assess the entirety of
the site, the THC NRHP determination could not be verified and remains undetermined.

This site was originally documented during the 2007 survey conducted by ARC (Figure 5.16). The site
contained a prehistoric component consisting of quartzite and chert debitage and fire-cracked rocks. The
site was located on the northern terrace of an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek. ARC selected the site
for further investigation and conducted excavations. As a result of the excavations, no further work was
suggested. The site was determined ineligible for NHRP designation in February 2008. Based on aerial
photographs dating to as early as 1942, the site was located within a densely forested area. The area
remained unmodified by modern development and construction until the present. Due to the intensive
testing of the site conducted by ARC, the site was not investigated during the cultural survey conducted by
IES.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey and site delineation, seven positive shovel tests and 302 negative shovel tests
were excavated within the 645.4-acre (264.38 ha) APE. As a result of the survey, five archeological sites
were revisited and eight newly recorded archeological sites were encountered. The eligibility
recommendations of the 13 sites are briefly summarized below and a tabular summary is presented in Table

41TR17 was a previously recorded prehistoric site originally described as containing a low-density scatter
of lithic debitage. Although the THC determined 41TR17 was ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or
listing as a SAL in 2011, IES revisited the site in an effort to verify the eligibility determination and
the accuracy of the horizontal boundaries. Due to APE limitations, only an 8.9-acre portion of the
recorded site was revisited by IES. During IES investigations, the siteâs presence was confirmed
through the presence of a single quartzite flake. However, as IES was unable to assess the entirety of
the site, a verification of the THC eligibility determination was not conducted. Based on the siteâs lack
of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as ineligible for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation, and the remaining portion of the
site is of undetermined eligibility. No further work is recommended at this location.
41TR18 was a previously recorded multiple component site described as containing prehistoric and
historic-age graffiti. Although the THC determined that site 41TR18 was ineligible for inclusion on
the NRHP or listing as a SAL in 2008, IES revisited the site in an effort to verify the eligibility
determination and the accuracy of the horizontal boundaries. Due to APE limitations, only a 15.6-acre
portion of the recorded site was revisited by IES. During IES investigations, no cultural material was
encountered. However, as IES was unable to assess the entirety of the site, a verification of the THC
eligibility determination was not conducted. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant
historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of
the site within the APE is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D,
nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this location.
41TR20 was a previously recorded multiple component site described as containing prehistoric and
historic-age artifacts. Due to APE limitations, only a 1.1-acre portion of the recorded site was revisited
by IES. During IES investigations, no cultural material was encountered. Based on project limitations,
the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield
significant archeological data, tthe site is recommended as undetermined eligibility for listing in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended
at this location.

41TR82 was a previously recorded multiple component site described as containing prehistoric and
historic-age artifacts. During IES investigations, two quartzite flakes were encountered that confirmed
the siteâs presence. However, no historic-aged material was encountered. Since initial documentation,
disturbances have removed a vast majority of the siteâs cultural material and have reduced the siteâs
overall size. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the
low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing in
the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is
recommended at this location.
41TR241 was a previously recorded historic-period site described as containing five historic-aged features
that included four foundations and a small depression. Although the THC determined that site 41TR241
was ineligible for inclusion as a NRHP or designation as a SAL in 2010, IES revisited the site in an
effort to verify the eligibility determination and accuracy of the horizontal boundaries. During IES
investigations, an ephemeral scatter of historic-aged debris was encountered. None of the originally
documented features were encountered by IES. No data was gathered that would suggest the THCâs
NRHP eligibility determination was inaccurate. As such, 41TR241 should remain ineligible for listing
under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at
this location.
41TR290 was a newly recorded historic-period site comprised of a low to moderate density scatter of
historic-period artifacts. During IES investigations, a surface accumulation of historic-period
household debris and construction material dating to the mid-20th century were encountered. Based on
the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield
significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this
location.
41TR291 was a newly recorded site containing a historic-period artifact scatter. During IES investigations,
a surface accumulation of historic-period household debris and construction material dating to the mid20th century were encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events
or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended at this location.
41TR292 was a newly recorded historic-period site containing six features and an ephemeral artifact scatter
dating to the mid-20th century. During IES investigations, the remnants of a mid-20th century residential
and agricultural/pastoral complex was located. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant
historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeologioncal data, the site is
recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL
designation. No further work is recommended at this location.
41TR293 was a newly recorded historic-period scatter. During IES investigations, a surface accumulation
of household debris dating to the mid-20th century was encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of
association with significant historical events or persons and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B,
or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this location.
41TR294 was a newly recorded historic-period site comprised of a surface scatter of artifacts. During IES
investigations, a surface accumulation of household debris dating to the mid-20th century was
encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or persons and
the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing
in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is
recommended at this location.

41TR295 was a newly recorded site comprised of a historic-period artifact scatter. During IES
investigations, a surface accumulation of household debris and construction material dating to the mid20th century was encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events
or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No

41TR296 was a newly recorded historic-period artifact scatter dating to the mid-20th century. During IES
investigations, a surface accumulation of household debris and construction material dating to the mid20th century was encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events
or persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended at this location.
41TR297 was a newly recorded prehistoric artifact scatter from an undetermined age. During IES
investigations, subsurface accumulation of prehistoric lithic debitage dating to an unknown prehistoric
period was encountered. Based on the siteâs lack of association with significant historical events or
persons and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the site is recommended as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D, nor considered for SAL designation. No
further work is recommended at this location.
Alexander Dobkins Cemetery was located 150 feet west of Tract 4A5. Based on field observations and
the results of a previous THC investigation, it appeared that there was potential for unmarked graves to
be located outside the current cemetery fence. Although the cemetery boundaries have not been
established through archival research, no evidence of unmarked graves or depressions was observed
outside the current cemetery fence. In addition, the APE was developed using a 150-foot buffer
surrounding the cemetery. This distance was considered sufficient for avoiding any potential unmarked
graves. No further work recommended.
Bear Creek Cemetery was located 150 feet north of Tract 4A2. Based on field observations and the results
of the previous THC investigation, it appeared that there was still potential for unmarked graves outside
the current cemetery fence. No evidence of unmarked graves or depressions was observed outside the
current cemetery fence. In addition, the APE was developed using a 150-foot buffer surrounding the
cemetery. This distance was considered sufficient for avoiding any potential unmarked graves. No
further work recommended.
Therefore, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the THC/SHPO concur with these findings
and the PIP Tranche 4 be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations.
However, if during construction any cultural resources (other than those detailed within this report) or
evidence of unmarked graves are unearthed, the operators should cease work immediately in that area. The
project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the
THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations
of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for Project Blue Sky in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. As the
project is within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the
DFW will need approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to modify their
Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a
federal action, the project will subsequently require compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the
project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was comprised of two components: 1) locate, identify, and
assess the project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE) for previously unrecorded
archeological sites, and to evaluate any such resource for potential eligibility as a
State Antiquities Landmark or for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), 2) document a large complex of abandoned commercial buildings slated
for demolition, determine if they are of historic-age, and if they meet any of the
criteria for NRHP listing. All work was conducted in accordance with 13 Texas
Administrative Code 26, and with 36 Code of Federal Regulations 60.4, which
outline the regulations for implementing the ACT and Section 106, respectively.
Archeologists Joshua Hamilton and Anne Gibson conducted the cultural resources
inventory on 02 October 2015, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7373. During
the IES survey, no archeological sites were documented within the APE. In
addition, the commercial building complex was determined to not be of historic
age, nor had it achieved historical significance since construction and was
subsequently ineligible for NRHP listing. No further work is warranted. However,
if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should
immediately stop construction activities in those areas, and contact the project
environmental representative to initiate coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission prior to resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area, environmental
setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and recommendations. This report
serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural resource
inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for Project Blue Sky located
southwest of the intersection of South Airfield Drive and South 20th Avenue in Fort Worth, Tarrant County,
Texas. The project area is plotted on the Euless 7.5-minute series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Quadrangle sheet and recent aerial photograph (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
As the project is within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the DFW will need
approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to modify their Airport Layout Plan to reflect the
permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will subsequently require
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the
project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the survey was comprised of two components: 1) locate, identify, and assess the project area or
Area of Potential Effects (APE) for previously unrecorded archeological sites, and to evaluate any such
resource for potential eligibility as a State Antiquities Landmark or for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), 2) document a large complex of abandoned commercial buildings slated for
demolition, determine if they are of historic-age, and if they meet any of the criteria for NRHP listing. All
work was conducted in accordance with 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, and with 36 Code of Federal
Regulations 60.4, which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT and Section 106, respectively.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Archeological Resources
Since the issuance of the Antiquities Permit for the project, the horizontal footprint of the APE has altered.
Originally, the APE was comprised of 78.2 acres; however, recent changes have eliminated elements of the
project and reduced the physical footprint of the project.
Although project design details are still in the early stages of planning, current plans call for the demolition
of a previously constructed corporate office building complex and the construction of five office buildings,
dining facilities, an entry pavilion, a multi-storied parking garage, and associated access roads within a
43.46-acre area referred to as the project area or APE for this project. Although the exact depth of ground
disturbing activities has not yet been determined, subsurface investigations within areas displaying potential
for buried cultural deposits were assessed to culturally sterile soil.

Historic-Period Resources
Although an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with Section 106, an assessment of indirect effects would be required per the NHPA
Section 106 regulations. Thus, any structure of historic age, encountered within the footprint of proposed
construction, or within 600 feet (approximately 182 meters [m]) of the project area, will be photographed
and assessed for their potential eligibility for listing on the NRHP.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical climate
and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the rain
usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The
subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional exceedingly
hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
The APE was situated within a dissected upland setting within the northern breaks of the Trinity River
Valley. The majority of the APE was located upon an upland ridge that trended along a general northwest
to southeast direction and paralleled an unnamed tributary of the West Fork Trinity River. The western
portion of the APE contained the highest elevation and the elevation declined from the west to the east.
The elevation ranged between 482 to 565 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The unnamed tributary
flowed in a southeasterly direction across the APE and confluences with the West Fork Trinity River 0.76mile southeast of the APE.
Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
The APE was located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the Northern
Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timber ecoregions (McGowen et al. 1984). Variation among each
ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The natural divide between these
two geological formations parallels Big Bear Creek, which runs from the northwest to the southeast through
the western portion of the DFW property.
Northern Blackland Prairie
The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick, plastic
clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford
Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within the
Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised
of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic
clay (Coffee 1980, McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2015).
Eastern Cross Timbers
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987.) This region contains countless hills that were once heavily wooded and contained
oak, walnut, blackjack, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred
to the region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban
expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become highly
fragmented and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains today (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department [TPWD] 2015). The APE was underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation (Figure
2.1). The Woodbine underlies the Eagle Ford Formation and the strata dates back to the Late Cretaceous
in the Upper Cenomanian stage (Winton 1925). The Woodbine is primarily sandstone and contains a small
percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay.

Soils Description
Four soil series are contained within the direct APE (Figure 2.2). Table 2.1 provides a brief description of
the five soils and their percentages. According to the Soil Survey of Tarrant County (Ressel 1981) and U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) web soil survey data
for Tarrant County (USDA 2015), the five soil series within the project consist of Birome-Aubrey-Rayex
complex, 5 to 15 percent slopes, Crosstell fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Crosstell fine sandy loam
3 to 6 percent slopes, and Pulexas fine sandy loam, frequently flooded, which are respectively distributed
across 55.6, 5.8, 23.1, and 15.5 percent of the APE.

CHAPTER 3: BACKGROUND REVIEW
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC,
identified that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register Properties, historical
markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2015).
The TASA database indicates that one previously conducted cultural resources survey lies within one-mile
(~1,600m) of the APE. The survey was conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. in 2010 under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5423 (TASA 2015). The previously conducted survey is summarized in Table 3.1 and
illustrated in Figure 3.1.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic map, the NRCS
digital soil database for Tarrant County, the National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940
Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced
maps, the Fort Worth District Potential Archeological Liability Map (FT-PALM), and both past and current
aerial photography. In addition, the THCâs Historic Sites Atlas was consulted to identify if any previously
designated or identified historic properties were within the APE, including: NRHP properties, State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL), and Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHM), which includes
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL), historic cemetery markers, thematic markers, and 1936
Centennial Markers.

Archeological Resources
During the desktop analysis and background review, conducted prior to the pedestrian survey, it was
determined that the majority of the APE was comprised of a built landscape that contained a large corporate
office-building complex. Subsequently, these areas would have been exposed to a variety of activities that
have drastically affected the soilâs stratigraphic integrity prior to the current project. However, modern and
historical aerial photographs indicated that isolated portions of the APE surrounding the building complex
were exposed to far fewer widespread ground-disturbing activities. A detailed summary of the past land
use and previous disturbances is provided in Section 5.1.
Based on these factors, it was determined that the vast majority of the APE contained a negligible
probability for intact archeological deposits. The few areas that have been unaffected by the construction
of the corporate complex likely retained a moderate to high potential for encountering shallow buried
deposits.
Standing Buildings and Structures
As mentioned above, a single farmstead was located within the western margins of the APE as early as
1942. The farmstead was demolished in 1963. Through background research, it was determined that the
corporate building complex currently located within the APE was constructed in 1980 and subsequently
not of historic age. As such, no historic-aged buildings or structures were anticipated within the APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the Project Blue Sky project was conducted on the October 2, 2015. The
methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated by
the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to field work, the
IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural resources have
been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600m) radius of the APE. This information was
detailed above. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils data, as well as, historic and
recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted of
excavating shovel tests in areas displaying minimal amounts of disturbance. Areas displaying high levels
of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other
documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels
not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the
presences of buried cultural material. If clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened,
material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition, the physical
properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and plotted using
hand-help global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of each test on
standardized shovel test forms. CTA survey standards recommend that an APE with an area of 43.46 acres
(17.59 ha), displaying little to no disturbance, should have approximately 39 shovel tests (one shovel test
per two acres) excavated during the pedestrian survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from this
amount due to the level of disturbance observed during the pedestrian survey. All shovel tests, cultural
features, and other site data were geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS.

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the
IES office. These documents and photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL
curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During the survey, no cultural resources were encountered within the 43.46 acres (17.59 ha) APE.
Shovel test unit locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1 and a photograph location map and general
photographs are located in Appendix A.

5.1 Survey Area
The APE was primarily located within a dissected upland setting along a northwest to southeast
trending ridge. The majority of the APE was covered by the existing office complex. Based on
historical and modern aerial images, the APE has been exposed to variable amounts of previous ground
disturbing activities since the mid-20th century. A detailed summary of the past land use and previous
disturbances is provided below.
During the mid-20th century, the APE was primarily comprised of woods with a few small agricultural
plots scattered within the central and western portions of the APE. A 1942 aerial photograph also
depicts the location of a farmstead along the western most portion of the APE. Several access roads
connected the farmstead to the surrounding agricultural fields. By 1957, the amount of active
agricultural fields had reduced with the majority becoming overgrown by secondary growth. Portions
previously comprised of woods within the 1942 aerial photograph appear even denser with the oldest
growth located along the unnamed tributary that parallels the current APE northern boundary. By 1963,
the farmstead had been demolished and several linear scars caused by vegetation removal are visible
across the APE. From 1963 to approximately 1978, the APE remains relatively unchanged. In 1979,
the outline of the corporate office building complex was carved through vegetation removal.
Construction of the complex was finished in 1980 and consisted of a variety of multi-storied buildings
pertaining to administrative, maintenance, and office functions. This construction was the most wide
scale form of ground disturbance that transpired within the APE. During this time, the unnamed
tributary that bisects the northernmost portion of the APE was altered with the construction of two dams
and the modification of the tributaryâs banks. Although modern construction of the corporate office
complex occupies the majority of the APE, several portions of the APE surrounding the complex have
remained undeveloped. Further construction occurred between 1990 and 1995, when a generator was
installed north of the northernmost office building. The corporate complex closed in 2009. As such,
the APE likely contained variable levels of subsurface preservation and subsequently a variable
potential for encountering buried archeological deposits. In summary, approximately 91 percent of the
APE has been exposed to some form of ground disturbing activity.

5.2 Archeological Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, seven negative shovel tests were excavated to test for subsurface cultural
materials (Figure 5.1). Excavating shovel tests within the APE revealed two predominant soil types
across the APE and were consistent with data received from the soil survey. The soils within the APE
were dominated by a sandy loam pertaining to the Crosstell soils series. The soil contained a brown
(10YR 4/3) to a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) upper layer that overlaid a more compact dark
yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam at approximately 30 to 40 cmbs. No shovel test was
excavated deeper than 40 cmbs because of the shallow depth of Holocene-aged soils. In addition to
excavating shovel test, subsurface exposure including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and cutbanks
along any erosional feature were examined. Excavating shovel tests and visual inspections revealed
that there are no soils suitable for containing deeply buried cultural material within the APE.

5.3 Standing Building/Structure Demolition Assessment
Existing Conditions
During the IES survey and background research, it was determined the office complex was constructed
between 1979 to 1980; therefore, the structures would not be of historic age. Within the office complex,
nine buildings and three associated structures were documented during the survey. The 12 properties
consisted of central administrative building, warehouse and loading docks, the main building, the
cafeteria, six office buildings, three parking lots, and a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) structure. The results of the documented buildings and structures are summarized below in

Warehouse/Maintenance Building
Feature 1 consisted of the warehouse building and loading docks. The building was âË©â-shaped and
extended 775ft in length. The width of the western end was 80ft and the eastern end was 125ft. A
small atrium was located within the eastern end of the warehouse, as visible on aerial photographs.
Two entrances from Elm Street lead to the loading docks of the warehouse (Appendix A, Photograph
4). The loading docks consisted of two bays each with ramped entrances.
Administrative Building
Feature 2 consisted of the main building, which was located on top of the warehouse building
(Appendix A, Photographs 5 and 6). The building extended 600ft in length and was 50ft wide. An
additional 50ft long overhang, supported by steel truss, extended from the eastern edge of the building
and extended to a circular curbside drop off point and visitor parking lot. The building contained three
floors with tinted glass panel windows.
Rotunda/Cafeteria Building
Feature 3 consisted of the rotunda that contained the cafeteria and was approximately 150ft in diameter.
The cafeteria consisted of a two-story building with indoor and outdoor dining areas. The interior of
the cafeteria area contained booths and tables to sit and view the surrounding forest, while the outside
dining area contained a paved patio with tables and chairs. The cafeteria building was designed into
the hillside of the ridge leading toward the impounded tributary. Natural light entered the building
through a single conical skylight located within the center of the circular curbside drop. The eastern
face of the building was exposed within the terrace side and allow for access to the outdoor dinner area.
Office Buildings
Feature 4 consisted of the six office buildings that were each 350ft in length and 50ft in width. The
structures were orientated in a checkered like pattern comprised of two sets of three buildings. Spacing
between each structure varied depending on the size of the separating courtyard. Each structure was
connected by a set of corridors that connected the office structures to each other and to the main
administrative building. Each office structure was four stories tall and contained tinted glass panel
windows (Appendix A, Photographs 7 through 10). To counter for the steep topography, each
structure was elevated above the ground, with specific height depending upon location along the sloping
hillside, by square concrete pillars. Each structure contained an outdoor set of stairs leading to the
ground level for emergency access (Appendix A, Photograph 11). Open space under the buildings
was utilized for maintenance, utility equipment, and miscellaneous storage (Appendix A, Photograph
12).
Parking Lots
Feature 5 consisted of the two areas for general parking and a single area for visitor parking (Appendix
A, Photographs 13 through 16). The two general parking areas were general in nature and bisected
by Elm Street. The visitor parking lot was located above the cafeteria rotunda and parking spots were
located around the skylight and along the periphery boundaries of the rotunda.
Impoundment Structure
Feature 6 contained an impoundment structure that was located at the northeastern extent of the APE
(Appendix A, Photograph 17). The structure also served as a slightly elevated footbridge that bisected
the channelized ponds. The feature extended 90ft in length and was 12ft wide. The footbridge was
connected to the adjacent hillside through series of stone steps. The bridge connects the office
complexes to a small cleared area that was utilized as a smoking area, as indicated by nearby signs.

HVAC Structure
Feature 7 contained the HVAC structure that was a later addition constructed between 1990 and 1995.
The structure was 55ft by 35ft and contained two stories (Appendix A, Photograph 18). The structure
was constructed out of aluminum sheet metal and steel and contained a single access door for
maintenance. The lower story contained what appeared to be three boilers and the second story
contained the associated cooling system with three exhaust fans.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Although it was determined that the vast majority of the APE had been previously disturbed by
commercial development, isolated portions of the APE, outside the footprint of existing
buildings/structures, were examined for archeological resources. During the pedestrian survey, seven
negative archeological shovel tests were excavated within the 43.46 acres (17.59 ha). Although a
corporate office complex was documented through the survey, the buildings and structures were not of
historic age. No cultural resources were encountered.
Therefore, the DFW International Airport is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic
properties are affected under 36 CFR 800.4 (d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the SHPO/THC
concur with these findings and the Project Blue Sky be permitted to continue without the need for
further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during
construction, the operators should cease work immediately in that area, and the THC/SHPO should be
notified prior to resuming any construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations
of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for the Trigg Lake Access Road, Tarrant County, Texas. As the project
is within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the DFW
will need approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to modify their
Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a
federal action, the project will subsequently require compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the
project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark or eligibility for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. All work conformed to 13 Texas
Administrative Code 26, which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT.
Archeologists Joshua Hamilton and Anne Gibson conducted the cultural resources
inventory on 28 September 2015, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7373. During
the IES survey, no archeological sites were documented within the Area of Potential
Effects. No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural resources are
unearthed during construction, the operators should immediately stop construction
activities in those areas, and contact the project environmental representative to
initiate coordination with the Texas Historical Commission prior to resuming any
construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area, environmental
setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the investigations and recommendations. This report
serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 requirements.

1.1 Introduction
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural resource
inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for Trigg Lake Road located
northwest of the intersection of International Parkway and Rental Car Drive in Euless, Tarrant County,
Texas. The project area is plotted on the Euless 7.5-minute series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Quadrangle sheet and recent aerial photograph (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
As the project is within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the DFW needed
approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify their Airport Layout Plan to reflect
the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a federal action, the project will subsequently require
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the NHPA. In
addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the project will be subjected to the
provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess the project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE)
for previously unrecorded archeological sites, and to evaluate any such resource for potential eligibility as
a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
While three different projects (Property Inventory Project; Project Blue Sky; and Trigg Lake Access Road)
were conducted for the DFW under a single Antiquities Permit (#7373), the DFW requested that each
project be discussed within a separate report deliverable. This report documents the cultural resources
survey conducted within Trigg Lake Access Road. The remaining projects will be discussed within
subsequent reports. All work was conducted in accordance with 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26,
and with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.4, which outline the regulations for implementing the
ACT and Section 106, respectively.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
Although project design details were in the development stage at the time of survey, design was assumed
to be typical for an undivided two-lane access road construction within an upland setting. To ensure a large
enough area was assessed, a 125-foot wide corridor was assessed between the existing Trigg Lake Access
Road and International Parkway, which totaled approximately 1.5-acres (0.6-hectare [ha]). Although the
exact depth of ground disturbing activities was not determined, subsurface investigations within areas
displaying potential for buried cultural deposits were assessed to culturally sterile soil.
Indirect APE
Although an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project
required compliance with Section 106, an assessment of indirect effects would be required per the NHPA
Section 106 regulations. Thus, any structure of historic age, encountered within the footprint of proposed
construction, or within approximately 300 feet of the APE, was photographed and assessed for potential
eligibility for listing on the NRHP.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical climate
and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the rain
usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The
subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year round temperature with the occasional exceedingly
hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
The APE was situated within a sloping setting along the western margins of an upland ridge that overlooks
the Bear Creek floodplain. The APE was located approximately 425 meters (m) (1,411 feet) north of the
original channel of Bear Creek, which was diverted and channelized further south within the DFW property.
The upland setting is dissected by a single erosional feature that cuts north/south across the easternmost
portion of the APE. In general, the topography slopes from east to west toward Trigg Lake.
Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
The APE was located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the Northern
Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timber ecoregions (McGowen et al. 1984). Variation among each
ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The natural divide between these
two geological formations parallels Big Bear Creek, which runs from the northwest to the southeast through
the western portion of the DFW property.
Northern Blackland Prairie
The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick, plastic
clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford
Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within the
Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised
of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic
clay (Coffee 1980, McGowen et al. 1987, Scoggins 2004, USGS 2016).
Eastern Cross Timbers
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987.) This region contains countless hills that were once heavily wooded and contained
post oak, blackjack oak, walnut, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers
referred to the region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to
urban expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become
highly fragmented and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains today (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department [TPWD] 2016). The APE was underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological
formation (Figure 2.1). The Woodbine underlies the Eagle Ford Formation and the strata dates back to the
Late Cretaceous in the Upper Cenomanian stage (Winton 1925). The Woodbine is primarily sandstone and
contains a small percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay.

Soils Description
Two soil series are contained within the direct APE (Figure 2.2). According to the Soil Survey of Tarrant
County (Ressel 1981) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) web soil survey data for Tarrant County (USDA 2016), the two soil series within the
project consist of Ferris Clay, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded and Navo clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes,
which are respectively distributed across percent of the APE. Table 2.1 provides a brief description of the
two soils and their percentages.

CHAPTER 3: BACKGROUND REVIEW
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC,
identified that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register Properties, historical
markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2016). In addition, no portion of the APE
has been previously surveyed.
The TASA database indicated that three previously conducted cultural resources surveys were located
within one-mile (~1,600m) of the APE. The previously conducted surveys are summarized in Table 3.1
and illustrated in Figure 3.1.

3.2 Previous Recorded Sites within Vicinity
A file search within the TASA identified that there are no National Register Properties, historical markers,
or cemeteries located within one-mile of the APE (TASA 2016). TASA records document there were 14
previously recorded archeological sites located within one-mile of the APE. The sites are summarized in
Table 3.2 and illustrated in Figure 3.1.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
During the desktop analysis and background review, conducted prior to the pedestrian survey, it was
determined that the entirety of the APE was located within a densely wooded section of the DFW property.
Historical aerial photographs illustrate the APE was clearâcut as early as 1956 and was used for pasture
land purposes. Sometime in the late 1960s, the APE started to become overgrown by larger woody
vegetation, which has continued to present day. Although the APE had been affected by few large-scale
development or land use ground disturbances, the root systems associated with the vast amount of
secondary tree growth have affected the subsurface stratigraphic integrity to an unknown degree. Based on
these factors, it was determined that the vast majority of the APE contained a moderate to high probability
for containing archeological deposits, with a moderate to low potential for any archeological site to contain
a high amount of subsurface stratigraphic integrity.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the Trigg Lake Access Road project was conducted on the 28 September
2015. The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 1996, 2001). Prior to
field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine what cultural
resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (~1,600m) radius of the APE. This
information was detailed above. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils data, as well
as, historic and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Background Review
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USGS topographic map, the NRCS
digital soil database for Tarrant County, the National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940
Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced
maps, the Fort Worth District Potential Archeological Liability Map (FT-PALM), and both past and current
aerial photography.

4.2 Survey
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted of
excavating shovel tests in areas displaying minimal amounts of disturbance. Areas displaying high levels
of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other
documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.

4.3 Shovel Tests Excavation
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile
deposits. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural
stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware
cloth to test for the presences of buried cultural material. If clay content was high and could not be
efficiently screened, material was troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural deposits. In addition,
the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All test locations were recorded on paper and
plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. CTA survey standards recommend that an APE with an area
of 1.5 acres (0.6 ha), displaying little to no disturbance, should have approximately five shovel tests (three
shovel test per acre) excavated during the pedestrian survey. However, shovel tests numbers varied from
this amount due to the level of disturbance observed during the pedestrian survey. All shovel tests, cultural
features, and other site data were geospatially recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS.

4.4 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other documentation
was included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily curated at the IES
office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs were organized and
catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During the survey, no cultural resources were encountered within the 1.5 acre (0.6 ha) APE. Shovel test
unit locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1 and a photograph location map and general photographs are
located in Appendix A.

5.1 Survey Area
The APE was primarily comprised of dense mixed woods with an understory containing thick
accumulations of brier, vine, and saplings within a dissected sloping upland setting. Historically, the
majority of land within the APE was utilized for pastoral purposes until the late 1960s and most ground
disturbing activities would have been associated with the clearing of vegetation. After the land ceased to
be used as a pasture, the APE gradually became overgrown with vegetation.

5.2 Archeological Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
IES investigators excavated four negative shovel tests to test for subsurface cultural materials. Excavating
shovel tests within the APE revealed one predominant soil type which was consistent with data received
from the soil survey. The soils within the APE were dominated by clay pertaining to the Navo soil series.
The soil contained a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) that extended to a depth of 30 cmbs. No shovel test
was excavated deeper than 40 cmbs because of the shallow depth of Holocene-aged soils. In addition to
excavating shovel tests, subsurface exposure including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and cutbanks
along any erosional feature were examined. Excavating shovel tests and visual inspections revealed that
there are no soils suitable for containing deeply buried cultural material within the APE. No cultural
resources were encountered within the APE.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, four negative archeological shovel tests were excavated within the 1.5-acre
(0.6 ha) area. Although it was determined that the APE contained a moderate to high potential for
containing cultural resources, none were encountered.
Therefore, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, and that no historic properties are affected
under 36 CFR 800.4 (d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the SHPO/THC concur with these findings
and the Trigg Lake Access Road be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resource
investigations. However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should
cease work immediately in that area, and the THC/SHPO should be notified prior to resuming any
construction activities.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of
historic-age cemetery investigations conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions,
LLC (IES) for the Property Inventory Project (PIP) located within the Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport (DFW) property in Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. The PIP is
designed to facilitate the leasing of DFW property for commercial development. Approval
from the Federal Aviation Administration will be required to modify the Airport Layout
Plan (ALP) to reflect the permanent alterations on DFW property. The lease of these tracts
has been prioritized by the DFW Commercial Development Department and subsequently
organized into four separate tranches (Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4) previously surveyed by IES.
This report documents additional investigations of three historic-age cemeteries
(Harrington Family Cemetery, Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and Bear Creek
Cemetery) identified during the surveys of Tranches 1 and 4. The goal of these
investigations was to determine the boundaries of each cemetery and assess for the
presence of unmarked graves outside of current cemetery fences within the PIP Area of
Potential Effects (APE).
Since the ALP modification is considered a federal action, the project will subsequently
require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. In addition, as DFW is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). All work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, Chapter 711 of
the Texas Health and Safety Code, and the Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines for
cemeteries. The survey was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 7373.
Through coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for the cultural
resources inventories of Tranches 1 and 4, the agency determined that further investigations
were needed to sufficiently assess for the presence of unmarked graves to be located outside
of the historical boundaries of each cemetery and within the APE. Archival research was
conducted to identify the historic limits of each cemetery. Through archival research, it
was determined that sufficient archival information documenting the legal metes and
bounds of the Bear Creek Cemetery was obtained and no additional field investigations
were required. Due to the lack of records pertaining to the Alexander Dobkins Family
Cemetery and the Harrington Family Cemetery, it was determined that additional field
investigations were necessary. Therefore, a series of mechanical trenches was excavated
within the APE adjacent to the marked cemetery perimeters at the Harrington Family
Cemetery and the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery by Christopher Goodmaster on 11
and 12 October 2017. No human burials, evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware,
or grave monuments were encountered within the APE during these investigations. As
such, no further investigations at these cemeteries are warranted within the APE. However,
if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators should stop
construction activities, and immediately contact the project environmental representative
to initiate coordination with the THC prior to resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources investigations conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The purpose of
these investigations was to determine if unmarked burials were present outside of the marked historic
boundaries of cemeteries and within the Property Inventory Project (PIP) boundary. A description of the
proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical contexts, field and
analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations are provided in this document.
Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies
the Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT)
requirements of the proposed project.

1.1 Introduction
As requested by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), IES conducted additional archival research and
field investigations for the Harrington Family Cemetery, Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and Bear
Creek Cemetery located adjacent to PIP APE boundary. The proposed PIP is designed to facilitate the
leasing of DFW property for commercial development. The lease of these tracts was prioritized by the
DFW Commercial Development Department and was subsequently organized into four separate tranches
(Tranches 1, 2, 3, and 4; Figure 1.1). Each tranche was comprised of a variable amount of smaller âareas,â
which were in turn subdivided into smaller âtracts.â
Any future development within the PIP boundary will require the DFW to modify the Airport Layout Plan
(ALP) to reflect the permanent alterations, which must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA). Since approval to modify the ALP is considered a federal action, the project will consequently
require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the NHPA. The project
is also subject to the provisions of the ACT, as DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. In
addition, under the provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (THSC), as amended by Senate Bill
(SB) 1630, a property owner may not develop property in a manner that would disturb an abandoned
cemetery (THSC Section 711.010[a]) until the human remains interred within that cemetery were removed
in an appropriate manner outlined in THSC Section 711.004(f). The goal of these investigations was to
identify the boundaries of each cemetery and assess for the presence of unmarked graves outside of current
cemetery fences within the APE of the PIP. All work conformed to Title 13, Chapter 26 of the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT, and was
conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 7373.
This report documents additional archival and fieldwork investigations of three historic-age cemeteries
(Harrington Family Cemetery, Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and Bear Creek Cemetery) identified
during the surveys of Tranches 1 and 4. Archival research was conducted to identify the historic limits of
each cemetery. Through archival research, it was determined that sufficient information documenting the
legal metes and bounds of the Bear Creek Cemetery was obtained and no additional field investigations
were required. Due to the lack of records pertaining to the Harrington Family Cemetery and the Alexander
Dobkins Family Cemetery, it was determined that additional field investigations were necessary. In
response, a series of mechanical trenches was excavated outside of the known cemetery perimeters within
the APE by Christopher Goodmaster on 11 and 12 October 2017.

1.2 Previous THC Coordination
On 03 February 2016, the THC provided review comments regarding the Tranches 1 and 4 interim draft
reports. In the agencyâs comment letters, additional information was requested pertaining to the Harrington
Family Cemetery, the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and the Bear Creek Cemetery. The THC
determined that the age, undetermined boundaries, partial fencing, and/or poor maintenance of the
Harrington Family Cemetery and the Alexander Dobkins Cemetery warranted additional archival research
to identify the historical boundaries of these cemeteries. In addition, although the Bear Creek Cemetery
was an active cemetery at the time of the survey and had well maintained boundaries, the THC determined
that, due to the age of the cemetery, there was potential for unmarked graves to be located outside the known
cemetery boundary. The THC requested that additional archival research be conducted to determine the
cemeteryâs original boundaries.
In response, IES consulted the DFW and relayed the THCâs comment. Through conversations with the
DFW, it was determined that there was no interest in developing between the Bear Creek Cemetery and
State Highway (SH) 360 or within 150 feet (ft) of the three cemeteries. IES then developed revised APE
boundaries that removed all areas within 150 ft of a cemetery and provided them to the THC within a
revised draft report.
On 28 July 2017, the THC issued a comment letter that requested clarification on how the 150-ft cemetery
buffers were established. The THC requested that archival research and/or scrapings be conducted to ensure
that no unmarked graves were located within the APE. This report contains the information generated from
the agencyâs request pertaining to the three cemeteries adjacent to the APE.

1.3 Area of Potential Effects
Tranche 1 contained 13 tracts, which totaled 1,219.4 acres, located within the southern and northwestern
portions of the DFW property in Dallas and Tarrant counties (Figures 1.2 and 1.3). Tranche 4 was
comprised of 14 tracts, totaling 645.4 acres, located within the western and southwestern portion of DFW
within Tarrant County (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Although exact project design details for each tract are still
in the early stages of planning, ground disturbing activities will be typical of those required for box-style
warehouse and mixed-use commercial development. The exact depth of ground disturbing activities has
not yet been determined; however, subsurface investigations within the APE were conducted to an
undisturbed culturally-sterile subsoil horizon.
Investigations of the cemeteries were conducted within a buffer of approximately 150 ft from the fenced
perimeters of the cemeteries and within the APE. Specifically, investigations were conducted adjacent to
the Harrington Family Cemetery within Tract 1B1 of Tranche 1 and adjacent to the Alexander Dobkins
Family Cemetery within Tract 4A5 in Tranche 4. As mentioned previously, since the historical 2015 IES
cultural resources survey, Tranche 4 Tract 4A2 boundary was modified through coordination with the
DFW. As a result, the northern extent of the 4A2 Tract boundary, from between the Bear Creek Cemetery
and SH 360, was removed; however, the APE boundary remained adjacent to the southern portion of the
cemeteryâs boundary. Although construction activities will occur nearby, no direct or indirect impacts to
the cemeteries are anticipated as part of the PIP development.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas and Tarrant counties are located in the northcentral portion of the State of Texas. This region has a
humid subtropical climate and an average annual rainfall ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches.
About half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest
months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the
occasional exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is irregularly dissected
by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries of surrounding streams. The periphery of the DFW property
contains more dramatic topography with incised drainages and named waterways, particularly along the
western, southern, and eastern limits. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the low-lying
Big Bear Creek valley floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay-rich Blackland Prairie soils
to the more erosive, sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological regions.
The topography of Tranches 1 and 4 is similar to the overall topographic pattern of the DFW.
Approximately 75 percent of the Tranche 1 project area is located within the rolling upland Blackland
Prairie setting with the remaining 25 percent located within the more steeply sloped margins of the Big
Bear Creek valley. Within Tranche 1, the Harrington Family Cemetery is situated in the headwaters of
Estelle Creek, located between two intermittent drainages that form the creek approximately 200 meters
(m) to the southwest (see Figure 1.4). Much of the Tranche 4 project area is located within the Cross
Timbers along the more steeply-sloped margins of the Big Bear Creek valley. The Alexander Dobkins
Family Cemetery and the Bear Creek Cemetery, located within Tranche 4, are situated along the Bear Creek
Valley. The Alexander Dobkins Cemetery occupies the dissected tread of a strath terrace above an unnamed
tributary of Bear Creek (see Figure 1.5). The Bear Creek Cemetery is located on a shoulder slope or strath
terrace above Bear Creek approximately 300 m south of the confluence with Little Bear Creek (see Figure
1.5). Table 2.1 contains a topographic description of each tract associated with the cemetery investigations.

Vegetation, Geology, and Soils
The APE is located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the Northern
Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregions (Griffith et al. 2007). Variation among each
ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The Blackland Prairie occupies
the Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) while the Woodbine Formation (Kwb) underlies the Cross Timbers
(McGowen et al. 2007; Figure 2.1). The natural divide between these two geological formations parallels
Big Bear Creek, which extends from the northwest to the southeast through the western portion of the DFW
property.

Page 356

Northern Blackland Prairie
The Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion is characterized by low-relief topography containing dense, dark,
plastic clay-rich soils typified by the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Coffee et al. 1980).
The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological
formation within the Blackland Prairie (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the Late Cretaceous
period and is comprised of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades
upward into highly plastic clay soils.
Eastern Cross Timbers
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
orientated along a northeast-to-southwest axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987). The countless hills were once heavily wooded by dense stands of oak, walnut,
blackjack, and hickory trees that grew in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the region
as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. Due to urban expansion, agricultural
development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation of the once expansive Cross Timbers
ecoregion has become highly fragmented and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remain
today (TPWD 2017). The APE is underlain by the Late Cretaceous-aged Woodbine (Kwb) geological
formation, which underlies the Eagle Ford Formation (Winton 1925). The Woodbine Formation is
primarily composed of sandstone, but also contains a small percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay
(Figure 2.1).
Soil survey data for Dallas and Tarrant counties indicate that the cemeteries and adjacent areas are underlain
by five soil series (Coffee et al. 1980; Ressel 1981; Figures 2.2 and 2.3). Soils within and adjacent to the
cemeteries are comprised of map units typical of the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers regions. Table
2.2 provides a brief description of the six soil map units (USDA 2017).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicated that no previous
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within or immediately adjacent to the cemeteries
investigated during this field effort prior to the surveys of PIP Tranches 1 and 4 for DFW by IES in 2015
(TASA 2017). The TASA records illustrate that three previous surveys have been conducted within 1 mile
(mi; 1.6 kilometers [km]) of the Harrington Family Cemetery (Table 3.1). Eight cultural resources surveys
have been previously conducted in the vicinity (i.e., within 1 mi [1.6 km]) of the Alexander Dobkins Family
Cemetery (Table 3.2). In the vicinity of the Bear Creek Cemetery, eight previous cultural resources surveys
have been conducted (Table 3.3).

3.3 Historical Context
North Central Texas
Well before Anglo-American settlers and frontiersmen began migrating into the region, the area was
primarily occupied by various Native American groups, including the Tonkawas, Hasinai Caddos, and
Anadarkos (Hightower 2016; Maxwell 2016). The first Mexican, American, and European settlers arrived
in this area prior to the Texas Revolution in 1836 when the Mexican government granted the land to several
prominent settlers (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).
After the Republic of Texas was established in 1836, 180 million acres were opened for settlement. To
entice settlers from the United States, large land grants, bounties, headrights, and premiums were issued
out to those who qualified. One such land grant was issued to William S. Peters, an English businessman
who immigrated to the United States in 1827. Peters was an empresario (or immigration agent) who

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 363

received several land grant contracts from the republic. The first of these contracts resulted in the formation
of Peterâs colony (Figure 3.1). The terms of the contract required the empresario to recruit settlers from
outside the republic at a rate of 200 families within a three-year period. In return, the colonists were to be
granted 320 acres per single man and a maximum of 640 acres per family. The empresario was allowed to
retain up to one-half of a colonistâs grant as payment for services rendered, including land surveys and title
applications. The empresario provided powder, shot, and seed and in some cases built settlersâ cabins. The
empresario also received 10 sections of premium land from the republic for every 100 families they settled
(Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).

Figure 3.1: Map of Peters Colony (from Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).

Dallas County
By 1840, American explorers began to enter and settle the region now known as Dallas County. Settlers
found rich soil, ample water, useful trees, and an abundance of wild game (Maxwell 2016). Recurring
conflicts with Native American tribes caused many of these settlers to seek protection at Birdâs Fort, located
near present-day Arlington. The land claims of settlers located at Birdâs Fort were blocked by Peters
Colony, thus leaving families from the fort to join one of the first settlers of Dallas County, John Neely
Bryan, on the site of the new town of Dallas in 1842. After continuing attacks on outlying settlements by
Native Americans, Sam Houston signed a treaty with tribal chiefs at Birdâs Fort in 1843. By the mid-1840s,
several new communities were formed in the region (Maxwell 2016).
Dallas County was officially formed in 1846 and Dallas was elected the county seat in 1850. In the 1850s
and 1860s, the countyâs economy was dominated by crops of corn, cotton, and wheat and livestock
comprising hogs, cattle, and sheep. Despite the exodus of soldiers during the American Civil War, the
population of Dallas County increased as it attracted refugees and slave owners from other southern states.
During the 20th century, Dallas County gradually became less rural and agricultural as manufacturing
became more prevalent (Maxwell 2016).
Manufacturing became increasingly significant during and immediately after World War II, providing
employment for young people coming from rural areas and creating economic growth. By 1950,
approximately 90 percent of Dallas County was classified as being urban. During the following four
Volume VII: Investigations of Historic Cemeteries
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 364

decades, the population of the county tripled from 600,000 to 1.8 million. Major industries included
manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, and the service industry. As of 2014, Dallas County has a
population of 2.5 million people (Maxwell 2016).
Tarrant County
The population of the Tarrant County region had increased enough by 1849 to warrant additional military
support and the establishment of a military outpost at the edge of the Texas frontier. In 1849, Major Ripley
S. Arnold was ordered to find a new fort site near the West Fork and Clear Fork of the Trinity River as part
of a plan proposed by Army General William Jenkins Worth to have a line of forts bordering the frontier.
The new location was officially named Fort Worth in honor of General Worth. The fort operated at the site
for several years before being evacuated for posts farther west in 1853. Settlers living nearby moved into
the abandoned fort and used the former barracks for businesses. In 1860, Fort Worth became the county
seat of Tarrant County and began construction on a county courthouse (Hightower 2016; Schmelzer 2010).
The Civil War and Reconstruction years during the 1860s saw the population decrease as well as economic
decline and shortages. During the late 1860s and early 1870s, the developing cattle industry provided the
economic boom the county needed. Cowboys driving cattle north on the Chisholm Trail to Kansas would
stop in Fort Worth, spending money at local businesses and stocking up on supplies for the long journey
ahead. During the 1870s, the local economy was further aided by the construction of the Texas and Pacific
Railroad and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad through Fort Worth (Hightower 2016; Schmelzer 2010).
The combination of agriculture and cattle ranching activities continued to fuel growth in Tarrant County
and the population increased from 41,142 to 152,800 between 1890 and 1920. The economy continued to
improve with the onset of World War II and Fort Worth became an aviation powerhouse in both the military
and manufacturing sectors. The area experienced a population surge during the mid-to-late 20th century
and the population rose from 361,253 in 1950 to 1.4 million by 2000 (Hightower 2016).

3.4 Cultural Resources Potential
Harrington Family Cemetery
The Harrington Family Cemetery is located within the now abandoned community of Estelle. During the
late 19th century, the cemetery property and adjacent land was owned by Bryant Harrington. The earliest
burial within the cemetery is of Bryant Harringtonâs eldest son Archibald W. Harrington in 1892. Through
its history, the Harrington Family Cemetery has largely been isolated within a wooded area, south of the
community of Estelle. During the THC survey of the cemetery in 2004, investigators noted that headstones
were missing and depressions, likely pertaining to unmarked graves, were identified within the fenced
cemetery area. The THC considers the cemetery to be endangered due to the vandalism, undetermined
boundaries, and its location in a heavily wooded area with no gate securing the fenced cemetery area.
Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery
Alexander Dobkins and his family emigrated to Tarrant County from Tennessee in 1852. After his death
in 1869, he was the first known burial within the cemetery on his family farmstead. Other members of the
Dobkins family were interred there through the late 19th century. The Tarrant County Cemetery Records
(compiled in the 1950s) indicate that there are an estimated 12 graves in the cemetery, but that some of the
stones were removed and displaced. When the THC recorded the cemetery in 2005, only six markers were
indicated. The THC considers the cemetery highly endangered due to the undetermined boundary, partial
fencing, and poor maintenance.
Bear Creek Cemetery
The Bear Creek Cemetery was developed adjacent to the Bear Creek Missionary Baptist Church. The
church was organized in 1853 on land donated by charter member Isham Crowley. The earliest known
burial within the cemetery was of Hiram Monson Farris in 1858. In 1876, Crowley officially conveyed the
Volume VII: Investigations of Historic Cemeteries
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 365

property to the Baptist Church at Bear Creek; however, the church moved to Dallas County in 1887 and
was renamed Western Heights Missionary Baptist Church. As a result, the cemetery was abandoned until
it was placed in a charitable trust in 1979. At the time of the IES investigations, the Bear Creek Cemetery
was an actively used cemetery that was well-maintained and considered by the THC as having a low risk
of endangerment. However, due the cemeteryâs date of origin, there was still some potential for unmarked
graves to be located outside the known cemetery boundary.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
Through consultation with the THC, it was determined that additional research and/or survey investigations
of the three, historic-age cemeteries identified adjacent to the APE would be necessary to obtain THC
clearance for 100 percent of the APE. Research, identification, and field evaluation of the boundary of each
cemetery within the APE was completed in accordance with the guidelines provided by the CTA. The
archeological investigations for this project were conducted between 11 and 12 October 2017. The goal of
the investigations was to more precisely determine the boundaries of the Harrington Family Cemetery, the
Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and the Bear Creek Cemetery and to ensure that no unmarked burials
were present outside of the documented boundaries of the cemeteries.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this reason,
while general distances are described in imperial units (e.g., inches, feet, miles) within this report,
archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., centimeters, meters,
kilometers), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.

4.1 Archival Research
Deed research was conducted for each cemetery location. The purpose was to identify the historical
boundaries of each cemetery and to determine if any boundary changes have occurred since the
establishment of these cemeteries. Initial research was carried out by examining the primary sources within
deed and land title records in the documents provided by the DFW and previous archeological reports.
Further research was conducted at the Dallas County Clerk website, the Dallas Historical Society Archives,
the Tarrant County Clerkâs office, and the Tarrant County Archives. In addition, persons identified in the
chain of title were researched for historic significance in The Handbook of Texas Online and within various
local history publications.
Based on archival research, it was determined that the boundaries of Bear Creek Cemetery have not changed
since 1876. Cultural resources survey conducted by IES in 2015 also concluded that there was low potential
for the presence of unmarked graves outside of the fenced boundary based on the well-maintained state of
the Bear Creek Cemetery. Therefore, no further investigations were deemed necessary to determine the
historic boundary of the cemetery and no additional survey evaluation of the Bear Creek Cemetery
boundary was conducted during this effort.

4.2 Survey Methods
Prior to conducting fieldwork, IES coordinated with the THC to determine what portion of the APE would
need to be scraped, if the historical boundaries could not be defined through archival research. For any of
the three cemeteries where the historical boundary could not be verified, it was determined that fieldwork
would be needed for any portion of the APE within 150 ft of a cemeteryâs known boundary. Thus, fieldwork
was conducted within a 150-ft buffer of the current fenced boundaries of the Harrington Family Cemetery
and the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery. Due to the location of the Harrington Family Cemetery,
approximately 70 ft west of the Tract 1B1 APE, the goal of the investigations was to assess for the presence
of unmarked graves within the APE. However, as the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery was enveloped
on three sides by the Tract 4A5 APE, survey efforts were able to partially delineate the cemeteryâs
boundary, in addition to ensuring that no unmarked graves were present within the APE.
To accomplish these goals, vegetation removal and mechanical trenching was conducted adjacent to the
current boundaries of the Harrington and Alexander Dobkins cemeteries. Due to the dense vegetation
surrounding the two cemeteries, vegetation removal was required to allow access by a full-size backhoe.
To facilitate the removal of vegetation, the beginning, end, and any intersection of each transect were
flagged to assist with brush removal. Once the transects within an investigation area was flagged,
underbrush and trees less than 6-inches in diameter were removed using a hydraulic mulching attachment

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 367

mounted on a skid steer and chainsaws. The cleared transects, typically 8 to 10 ft wide, followed existing
cemetery boundary fences and topographic features adjacent to each cemetery. Following vegetation
removal, the transects were mechanically scraped and trenched with a backhoe.
As grave shafts are commonly identified during archeological investigations by rectangular soil stains that
differ in color and texture from the surrounding matrix, specific attention was paid to soil variations and
caution was exercised when investigating soil variations. Exposed soil was examined in plan and profile
to identify potential unmarked grave shafts. When soil variations were initially noted, more detailed
inspection was conducted by cleaning the exposed soil profiles with a spade or trowel. Although the goal
of the scraping was to identify unmarked grave shafts, it was assumed that the interments were likely buried
at varying depths and the potential for inadvertently exposing human remains was present. Mechanical
scraping and trenching were continued until undisturbed subsoil or bedrock was encountered. Standardized
soil descriptions were recorded along each excavation profile.

4.3 Evaluation
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria for evaluating properties for inclusion in the National Register are codified under
the authority of the NHPA of 1966, as amended (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 60.4 [aâd]),
and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site
eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that â[t]he term âeligible for inclusion in the National Registerâ
includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties
that meet National Register listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council guidelines,
any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a historic
property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity
of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Part 60.4(aâd)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. When applying NRHP criteria to historic-age cemeteries, except
for those eligible under Criterion D, burial places must also be integral parts of larger historic properties
eligible for NRHP-inclusion or meet the special requirements of one or more Criteria Considerations (Potter
and Boland 1992:14). Typically, a historic-age cemetery is not individually considered eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP unless it derives importance from distinctive architectural or artistic design features
(Criteria Consideration A), includes the grave of a person of transcendent historical importance and there
is no other appropriate site directly associated with them (Criteria Consideration C), or derives its
significance from age, distinctive design features, or association with persons or events of historical
importance (Criterion Consideration D).
Historic Texas Cemetery Designation Criteria
The Historic Texas Cemetery (HTC) is an official recognition of family and community graveyards outlined
in 13 TAC 22.6. This designation contributes to the protection of historic-age cemeteries by recording
Volume VII: Investigations of Historic Cemeteries
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 368

cemetery boundaries in county deed records in an effort to alert present and future landowners to the
presence of these historic resources. The HTC designation imposes no restrictions on private ownersâ use
of the land adjacent to a cemetery or the daily operations of the cemetery. A cemetery is eligible for HTC
designation if it is at least 50 years old and is recognized for its historical associations, such as associations
with the presence of a family or community.

4.4 Curation
This investigation employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be temporarily
curated at the IES office in McKinney and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
Archival research was conducted for each of the three historic-age cemetery areas: the Harrington Family
Cemetery, the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and the Bear Creek Cemetery. Archeological
investigations via mechanical scraping and trenching were conducted at two of the cemetery locations (the
Harrington Family Cemetery and the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery) for which detailed boundary
information was not available in archival sources. During these cemetery investigations, no human burials,
evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware, or grave monuments were encountered within the APE
at either the Harrington Family Cemetery or the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery.

5.1 Harrington Family Cemetery
The Harrington Family Cemetery, also known as the Estelle Cemetery or the Harrington-Woods Cemetery,
is situated 70 ft west of the Tract 1B1 boundary within PIP Tranche 1. The fenced cemetery extends
approximately 120 ft north-to-south by 100 ft east-to-west. According to records made by the THC in 2004,
the cemetery contained six gravestones, the earliest dating to 1892. However, evidence of multiple
unmarked graves was observed within the fenced perimeter at the time of the THC documentation. THC
investigators also noted the cemetery had been vandalized and was missing features such as a gate to the
fenced enclosure.
Previous Survey Observations
During the IES revisit to the cemetery in 2015, conditions similar to the 2004 THC assessment were
observed. IES observed seven headstones in various stages of deterioration and disrepair. Although no
signs of recent vandalism were observed, it appears to have been affected by vandalism through time as
several apparent grave depressions were lacking markers. During the visual assessment surrounding the
cemetery and within the westernmost portion of Tract 1B1, no depressions or other evidence was observed
that indicated graves were located outside the current cemetery fence. However, surface visibility was
restricted by dense vegetation and foliage outside of the cemetery fence (Appendix A, Photograph 01).
Through coordination with the THC, it was determined that unmarked graves could be located outside the
current cemetery boundaries and potentially within the APE. The THC recommended the review of
archival records, including deed records, cemetery records, family histories, and census records, to identify
the cemetery size and the number of interments. If sufficient evidence pertaining to the cemeteryâs
historical boundary could not be obtained, the THC would require mechanical scrapings within the portion
of the APE adjacent to the cemetery.
Archival Research
The Harrington Family Cemetery is detailed on the Dallas County Appraisal District (DCAD) website as
encompassing 0.2794 acre, measuring 101.11 ft by 120.89 ft by 100.7 ft by 120 ft, owned by R. D.
Harrington. The cemetery is a part of the Swing and Laws survey, Abstract 1426, which originally
contained 55.5 acres that were granted to M. L. Swing and George W. Laws in 1862 by the State of Texas.
The cemetery is located within the now abandoned community of Estelle. During the late 19th century, the
cemetery property and adjacent land was owned by Bryant Harrington. Mr. Harrington had come to the
area with his twin brother Ryan in the 1860s. His first wife Mary Ann Waugh Harrington had died in 1864
and was buried on the family farm in Estelle. In 1871, Harrington married Andrew Mackey-Lucetta Woods,
sister of Samuel A. Woods, and had four children. The earliest burial within the cemetery is of Bryantâs
eldest son Archibald W. Harrington in 1892.
Harrington was conveyed all 55.5 acres of the Swing and Laws survey by William H. Thomas in 1874
(Dallas County Clerk [DCC] Deed Volume V, Page 412). In 1883, Harrington had conveyed the property
north of the cemetery for use as a school (DCC, Deed Volume 64, Page 14). When Bryant Harrington died

Volume VII: Investigations of Historic Cemeteries
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 371

intestate in 1895, it appears his property was passed on to his surviving heirs, which included his wife A.
M. Lucetta Harrington, son Bryant M. Harrington, daughter Susan G. Harrington, son B. M. Harrington,
and a daughter from his first marriage, Sarah Alice Harrington Birch (DCC, Affidavit in Deed Volume 322,
Page 481).
The first mention of the cemetery property in a deed record is in DCC Deed Volume 870, Page 2253, dated
25 July 1966. In it, Bryant M. Harrington conveys interest to approximately 7 acres, which âis now being
used for cemetery purposes and shall continue to be used as such,â to Ryan Dorris Harrington, Mary M.
Harrington, Mary L. Woods, and B. M. Harrington. The remaining heirs of the extended Harrington and
Woods families conveyed their interest to Robert Ryan Harrington, son of Ryan Dorris Harrington and
great-grandson of Ryan Harrington, in 1987 (DCC Deed Volume 87016, Page 5312).
In addition to research on the DCC website, several historical societies within Dallas County were
contacted. The Dallas Historical Society (DHS) archives curates the most information pertaining to the
Harrington Family Cemetery. A file containing correspondence with Harrington family members, research
notes, deed records, maps, and newspaper clippings concerning the cemetery have been compiled by local
historian Frances James. Within the file, the historical boundaries of the cemetery were not mentioned in
any of the materials. The DHS archivist believed any records of such boundaries probably do not exist as
Ms. James would have previously located them during her research.
Cemetery Investigations
Although the Harrington Family Cemetery was delimited by a chain link fence at the time of the survey,
the historic cemetery boundary could not be established through archival research. As such, mechanical
excavation was conducted to determine if unmarked grave shafts were present outside of the current fence
and within the APE. Per the agreed upon methodology with the THC, a 0.9-acre study area within APE
Tract 1B1 was investigated during this field effort (Figure 5.1).
The fenced cemetery area is located within private property adjacent to the APE. The private property
limits completely envelope the fenced cemetery area and left an approximately 70-foot gap between the
cemetery and the APE boundary. At the time of this investigation, much of the vegetation surrounding the
cemetery outside of the APE had been removed in preparation for development of the adjacent private
property parcel (Appendix A, Photograph 02). Per the THC approved methodology, IES conducted a
pedestrian survey of the proposed scraping area. During the pedestrian survey, no evidence of unmarked
graves was identified; however, a significant amount of disturbance, including push-piles and rubble, as
well as modern trash was observed within the transects.
In total, 152 m (498.7 ft) of trenches were mechanically excavated within the study area. Scraping and
trench locations were selected based on proximity to the marked cemetery boundary, natural topography,
and previous disturbances. Trench 1 consists of a 12-m (39.4 ft) long trench extending east-to-west from a
fence line northeast of the cemetery (Appendix A, Photograph 03). The soil profile encountered within
Trench 1 comprised a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam surface layer to a depth of 25 centimeters
(cm) overlying dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay subsoil with slickensides and calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
concretions.
Trench 2 was excavated 34 m (11.5 ft) east of the cemetery and extended generally north-to-south for
approximately 61 m (200.1 ft) (Appendix A, Photograph 04). The Trench 2 soil profile exhibited similar
characteristics as Trench 1, although several push piles and trees were encountered near the southern end
of Trench 2, which necessitated a shift in the trench alignment to the southeast.
Trench 3 was excavated 28 m (91.9 ft) east of the cemetery and extended generally north-to-south,
paralleling a temporary road accessing the adjacent private property parcel (Appendix A, Photographs 05
through 07). Through a review of historical aerial photographs, it appears the south end of Trench 3

was adjacent to a remnant drainage swale that was largely infilled between 1972 and 1979, by a series of
evenly-spaced piles of fill. The soil profile exposed in Trench 3 ranged from a dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) to
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam surface layer to a depth of approximately 30 cm, where the soil
transitioned to light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly clay loam.
Trenches 4 and 5, each approximately 3 m (9.8 ft) long, were placed in a wooded area 42 m (137.8 ft)
southeast of the cemetery. A dense layer of fill, characterized as a thick deposit of concrete, asphalt, gravel,
trash, and sandy clay (Appendix A, Photographs 08 through 10), accumulated across the location between
1972 and 1979. The dense layer of fill extended to depths of 80 to 100 cm, where dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) clay loam was encountered.
Trench 6 was excavated 50 m (164 ft) east of the cemetery and extended generally north-to-south for 31 m
(101.7 ft) (Appendix A, Photograph 11). Within Trench 6, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay loam was
exposed at the surface in the northern portion of the trench while a surface layer of dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) clay loam overlying dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay loam was exposed in the southern portion of
the trench.
Trench 7, located 35 m (114.8 ft) east of the cemetery, measured 13 m (42.7 ft) long, oriented generally
northwest to southeast. The soil profile exposed in Trench 7 comprised primarily dark olive gray (5Y 3/2)
clay loam with a minor dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam surface layer in the northwestern portion
of the trench (Appendix A, Photograph 12).
Trench 8 was excavated approximately 36 m (118.1 ft) northeast of the cemetery and measured 13 m (42.7
ft) long, oriented in a northwest-to-southeast direction (Appendix A, Photograph 13). The soil profile
exposed in Trench 8 comprised a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam surface layer to a depth of 35
cm overlying dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay subsoil with slickensides and CaCO3 concretions.
Summary
In total, 152 m (498.7 ft) of trenches were mechanically excavated within the 0.9-acre study area
encompassing a 150-ft buffer from the Harrington Family Cemetery in PIP Tract 1B1. No subsurface
investigations took place on the private property parcel immediately surrounding the cemetery. With the
exception to the area containing artificial fill, located within a former drainage swale in the Estelle Creek
headwaters southeast of the fenced cemetery location, primarily undisturbed soils were encountered within
the study area. No human burials, evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware, or grave monuments
were encountered within the area investigated at the Harrington Family Cemetery.

5.2 Alexander Dobkins Cemetery
The Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery is situated along the western boundary of Tract 4A5 within PIP
Tranche 4. The current fenced boundary of the cemetery extends approximately 100 ft generally north-tosouth by 78 ft east-to-west. The cemetery contains the graves of seven members of the Dobkins family,
with the earliest dating to 1869.
Previous Survey Observations
During the 2015 IES survey, a visual assessment of the cemetery was conducted to determine the potential
for unmarked graves to be located outside the current cemetery boundaries (Attachment A, Photographs
14 and 15). It was noted that a portion of the marked cemetery boundary was within the Tranche 4 APE.
This discrepancy is probably due to inaccurate mapping of the cemetery location, which was likely digitized
from historical topographic maps or aerial photographs, prior to the PIP pre-planning process. During the
2015 survey, it was also noted that the cemetery had fallen into a state of disrepair. The observed
gravestones were in variable conditions ranging from intact to broken. The vegetation within the cemetery
had not been maintained and a large tree branch had fallen between several of the gravestones. Based on
the disorganized pattern of graves, the less maintained status of the cemetery area, and the presence of

Volume VII: Investigations of Historic Cemeteries
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.035
Page 374

undeveloped land adjacent to the cemetery, it was determined that there was a moderate potential for
unmarked graves outside the current cemetery boundary.
Archival Research
The Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery is located within the 640-acre survey, Abstract 107, initially
granted to Abraham Barnard as a part of the Peters Colony in 1850 and later by the State of Texas in 1854.
Abraham Barnard appears to have died shortly after 1850 and his widow Sarah sold 200 acres to Alexander
Dobkins in 1852 (Tarrant County Clerk [TCC] Deed Volume 320, Page 328).
Alexander Dobkins and his family emigrated to Tarrant County from Tennessee in 1852. After purchasing
the 200-acre farmstead, Alexander Dobkins was ordained as a minister in the nearby Bear Creek Baptist
Church and served as a postmaster for the community of Estelle. Alexander Dobkins died in 1869 and was
the first known burial on the family farmstead at the current location of the cemetery. As no probate records
were found for Alexander Dobkins, it is assumed the Dobkins farm passed to his heirs, including his widow
Mary A. Dobkins. When Mary A. Dobkins passed away in 1880, ownership of the farm and cemetery
appears to have been transferred to Dr. William Calloway Dobkins, son of Alexander and Mary A. Dobkins.
Since the initial conveyance of property to Alexander Dobkins in 1852, there are no deed records for the
property until 1928. After the death of Dr. William C. Dobkins, interest to the Dobkins farmstead was
divided amongst three of his heirs: O. S. Dobkins, J. W. Dobkins, and Estelle T. Smith (TCC Deed Volume
1054, Page 287). In 1968, the Dobkins heirs sold the farmstead property except for 0.057 acre for the
family cemetery with the right to ingress and egress for the cemetery property (TCC Deed Volume 4547,
Page 271). The 0.057-acre cemetery property is again mentioned in a deed to the City of Fort Worth in
1972 (TCC Deed Volume 5273, Page 927).
Additional historical resources were found at the Tarrant County Archives (TCA). The TCA has a file for
the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, containing deed records, photographs, newspaper clippings, and
research materials used for the THC historical marker application. Most of these materials had little to no
information regarding the boundary of the cemetery. The file did contain a history of the cemetery and the
Dobkins family written by Michael E. Patterson. Mr. Patterson describes the cemetery as being 0.057 acre
(100 ft by 100 ft) and surrounded by a wire and post fence. He mentions that the âcemetery itself does not
appear on any plat maps in the county records, and may never have been formally deeded as a burial plotâ
(Patterson 1981). The document by Mr. Patterson also includes a hand drawn plat of the cemetery made
by him in 1979. The map shows a total of 12 potential graves within the fenced cemetery boundary. A few
of these markers were noted as being questionable, such as an iron stake near the southeast corner and two
upright iron pipes south of William M. Dobkinsâ headstone. The headstone for William M. Dobkins was
made for a husband and wife, but the side labeled âwifeâ is blank. Within a heavy thicket, north of
Alexander Dobkinsâ and Nannie J. Dobkinsâ inscribed headstones are illegible sandstones fragments
potentially marking the head and feet of three graves.
When the THC recorded the cemetery in 2005, only six markers were indicated. These include Alexander
Dobkins, Mary A. Dobkins, Dr. William C. Dobkins, Nannie J. Dobkins, and William M. Dobkins. No
other markers from the 1979 map are illustrated. However, it appears that a marker was added for Mahlia
Mae Dobkins, who was the wife of Berry S. Dobkins, son of Dr. William C. Dobkins, and who was buried
at a different location. During the 2015 IES survey, seven grave markers were observed including the same
six the THC recorded and a new stone marker for Robert William Dobkins south of the headstone for
William M. Dobkins. The new headstone is in the general location of the upright iron pipes indicated on
the 1979 cemetery map.
Cemetery Investigations
Although the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery was partially delimited by the remnants of a post and
wire fence at the time of the survey, the historical cemetery boundary could not be established through
archival research. As such, mechanical excavation was conducted to determine if unmarked grave shafts
were present outside of the current fenced area within the APE. A 1.76-acre study area within PIP Tract

4A5, comprising a 150-ft buffer around the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, was investigated during
this field effort (Figure 5.2).
Since the 2015 IES survey, it appears that some maintenance has been conducted within the cemetery
(Appendix A, Photograph 16). The fallen tree limb observed in the center of the cemetery during the
2015 IES survey has been removed. The headstones of Alexander Dobkins and Mary A. Dobkins have
been cleaned and repaired. The remaining headstones appear to have been cleaned as well.
In total, 225 m (738.2 ft) of trenches were mechanically excavated within the study area. Trench locations
were selected based on proximity to the marked cemetery boundary, natural topography, and previous
disturbances. Trench 1 consists of a 21-m (68.9 ft) long trench extending east-to-west approximately 9 m
(29.5 ft) north of the cemetery (Appendix A, Photograph 17). The soil profile encountered within Trench
1 comprised a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam surface layer to a depth of 30 cm overlying
brownish yellow (10Y 6/8) fine sandy clay loam subsoil with CaCO3 concretions.
Trench 2 was excavated 2 m (6.6 ft) north of the cemetery and extended generally east-to-west for
approximately 19 m (62.3 ft) (Appendix A, Photograph 18). The Trench 2 soil profile exhibited brown
(10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam overlying brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam with olive (5YR
4/4) mottles and CaCO3 concretions.
Trench 3 was excavated 16 m (52.5 ft) north of the cemetery and extended generally east-to-west along the
shoulder of the upland slope of the landform (Appendix A, Photograph 19). The soil profile exposed in
Trench 3 exhibited brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam to a depth of 30 cm overlying a brownish yellow
(10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam. Bedrock was encountered in Trench 3 at a depth ranging between 50 and
55 cm.
Trench 4, approximately 12 m (39.4 ft) long and extending generally northwest-to-southeast, was placed
3.5 m (11.5 ft) north of the cemetery (Appendix A, Photographs 20 and 21). Trench 5 was also placed
approximately 3.5 m (11.5 ft) north of the cemetery and extended 8 m (26.2 ft) north-to-south, generally
paralleling Trench 4 and perpendicular to Trenches 1 through 3 (Appendix A, Photograph 22). The soil
profiles documented within Trenches 4 and 5 were similar, comprised of brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy
loam surface layer to a depth of approximately 25 to 30 cm before gradually transitioning to a brownish
yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam.
Trench 6 was excavated 16 m (52.5 ft) northeast of the cemetery along a narrow ridge spur. The trench
extended generally northeast-to-southwest for 33.5 m (109.9 ft) (Appendix A, Photographs 23 through
25). Within Trench 6, brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam was exposed near the surface to a depth of
approximately 25 cm while the subsoil gradually transitioned from reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine sandy
clay loam in the northeastern portion of the trench to brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam
with CaCO3 concretions in the southwestern portion of the trench. Dense gravel or regolith was
encountered at a depth range of 50 to 55 cm along the length of Trench 6.
Trenches 7 through 9, ranging in lengths from 10 to 12 m (32.8 to 39.4 ft), were excavated in an east-towest orientation approximately 10 to 12 m (32.8â39.4 ft) east of the cemetery on the opposite side of the
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) adjacent to the east side of the cemetery (see Figure 5.2). Trenches 7 through
9 occupied the eastern slope of the landform and the soil profiles exposed within these trenches were
generally similar, comprising a brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam surface layer gradually transitioning to
brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam subsoil by a depth ranging from 25 to 30 cm below
surface and overlying a dense gravel stratum encountered between 30 and 55 cm below surface (Appendix
A, Photograph 26).

Trenches 10 through 13 were excavated south of the fenced cemetery boundary. Trench 10 measured 8 m
(26.2 ft) long and was oriented east-to-west approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) south of cemetery (Appendix A,
Photograph 27). Trenches 11 and 12, oriented north-to-south approximately 3.5 m (11.5 ft) south of the
cemetery, were 11 m (36.1 ft) and 14 m (45.9 ft) in length, respectively (Appendix A, Photographs 28
through 30). Trench 13 was excavated 3.5 m (11.5 ft) south of the cemetery in an 11-m (36.1-ft) long eastto-west orientation. Soil profiles exposed within Trenches 10 through 13 comprise a brown (10YR 4/3)
fine sandy loam surface layer gradually transitioning to dense brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay
loam subsoil with CaCO3 concretions increasing in frequency between depths of 30 and 60 cm.
Trench 14 measured 40.5 m (132.9 ft) and was oriented north-to-south approximately 8 m (26.2 ft) east of
the cemetery, generally paralleling the pipeline ROW (Appendix A, Photographs 31 through 36). Despite
the proximity of Trench 14 to the pipeline ROW, generally undisturbed soils were encountered within the
majority of the trench. Soils consisted of a brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam surface layer gradually
transitioning to dense brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) fine sandy clay loam subsoil; however, disturbed fill
was observed within the upper 25 cm of the exposed soil profile along the southernmost 5 to 6 m (16.4â
19.7 ft) portion of Trench 14.
Summary
In total, 225 m (738.2 ft) of mechanically-excavated trenches were investigated within the 1.76-acre study
area encompassing a 150-ft buffer around the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery in PIP Tract 4A5.
Minor soil disturbances were noted during this fieldwork and were clearly attributed to the buried Flint
Hills Resources/Koch Pipeline Company high pressure petroleum pipeline ROW adjacent to the cemetery.
Otherwise, deflated but largely undisturbed soils were encountered within the study area. No human
burials, evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware, or grave monuments were encountered within
the area investigated at the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery.

5.3 Bear Creek Cemetery
Bear Creek Cemetery is situated along the western boundary of Tract 4A2 within PIP Tranche 4. The
current fenced boundary of the cemetery extends approximately 427 ft north-to-south by 447 ft east-to-west
(Figure 5.3). The cemetery was created in the late 1850s in association with the Bear Creek Missionary
Baptist Church, which was established in 1853. At present, the cemetery encompasses approximately 4.3
acres and contains more than 1,000 burials and memorials, including the grave of Isham Crowley.
Previous Survey Observations
The Bear Creek Cemetery is an active and well-maintained cemetery. A large graveled parking area is
situated immediately to the west of the cemetery and a maintenance facility is located immediately to the
north. The Bear Creek Golf Course extends along the east and southeast portions of the cemetery. A gravel
vehicle pathway extends from the western gated cemetery entrance to the center of the cemetery. The
pathway encircles the central and eastern portions of the cemetery. The oldest graves are concentrated
within the northwestern portion of the area encompassed by the pathway. Based on the organization of the
graves and the maintained nature of the cemetery, it was determined that there was a low potential for
unmarked graves outside the current cemetery boundaries (Attachment A, Photographs 37 through 45).

Archival Research
This cemetery was originally part of land owned by Isham Crowley, an original member of Peters Colony.
In 1854, Crowley was granted 640 acres as part of Peters Colony in eastern Tarrant County by the State of
Texas in Abstract 322. The cemetery, also known as Crowley Prairie Cemetery, was developed adjacent
to the site of the Bear Creek Missionary Baptist Church. The church was organized in 1853 on 2 acres
donated to the church in 1854 by charter member Isham Crowley (Crowley 1996). The earliest known
burial within the cemetery was that of Hiram Monson Farris in 1858.
In 1876, Crowley officially conveyed a property of 4 acres and 30 rods (4.1875 acres) containing the church
grounds and cemetery to the Baptist Church at Bear Creek (Tarrant County Deed Records, Deed Volume
K, Page 158). Since the 1876 deed from Isham Crowley, there have been no further conveyances of
property concerning Bear Creek Cemetery. However, the church moved to Dallas County in 1887 and was
renamed Western Heights Missionary Baptist Church. As a result, the cemetery was abandoned until it was
placed into a charitable trust in 1979. At that time, the cemetery was cleaned up and has since been
maintained by members of the Bear Creek Cemetery Association.
Summary
Because the boundary of Bear Creek Cemetery has not changed since 1876, no further investigations were
necessary to determine the historical limits of the cemetery. In addition, IES concluded during the 2015
survey assessment that there was low potential for unmarked graves outside of the fenced boundaries based
on the well-maintained state of the cemetery and organization of graves within it.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The goal of these investigations was to more precisely determine the boundaries of the Harrington Family
Cemetery, the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery, and the Bear Creek Cemetery and to ensure that no
unmarked burials associated within these cemeteries were present within the APE. Deed research was
conducted for each location, which attempted to identify the historical boundaries of each cemetery and to
determine if any boundary changes have occurred since these cemeteries were established.
Based on archival research, it was determined that the boundaries of Bear Creek Cemetery have not changed
since 1876. The cultural resources survey conducted by IES in 2015 also concluded that there was low
potential for the presence of unmarked graves outside of the fenced boundary based on the cemeteryâs
organization and well-maintained state. Therefore, no further investigations were deemed necessary to
determine the historic boundary of the cemetery and no additional fieldwork evaluation of the Bear Creek
Cemetery boundary was conducted during this effort.
Archeological investigations via mechanical scraping and trenching were conducted at the Harrington
Family Cemetery and the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery because detailed boundary information was
not available in archival sources. Fieldwork was conducted within a 150-ft buffer of the current fenced
cemetery boundaries. Due to the location of the Harrington Family Cemetery approximately 70 ft west of
the APE, IES was unable to confirm any portion of the cemetery boundary but was able to ensure that no
unmarked graves were present within the APE. However, as the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery was
encompassed by the APE on three sides, this survey effort was able to partially delineate the cemetery
boundary in addition to ensuring that no unmarked graves were present within the APE. In total, 152 m
(498.7 ft) of trenches were mechanically excavated within the 0.9-acre study area encompassing a 150-ft
buffer from the Harrington Family Cemetery in PIP Tract 1B1. Similarly, 225 m (738.2 ft) of mechanicallyexcavated trenches were investigated within the 1.76-acre study area encompassing a 150-ft buffer around
the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery in PIP Tract 4A5.
During these cemetery investigations, no human burials, evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware,
or grave monuments were encountered within the APE at either the Harrington Family Cemetery or the
Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery. Based on the results of these investigations, there is little to no
potential for the presence of unmarked graves associated with either the Harrington Family Cemetery or
the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery to be present within the adjacent portions of Tracts 1B1 or 4A5
within the APE.
A 25-ft construction avoidance buffer surrounding the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery and the Bear
Creek Cemetery is recommended to protect these cemeteries from potential impacts. No heavy machinery
should be allowed to operate within the avoidance area during construction. It is also recommended that
the design and installation of impervious surfaces in areas adjacent to these cemeteries be done in a manner
that limits stormwater runoff, which could inadvertently cause erosional damage.
Due to the inaccuracies observed in relation to the current boundaries of the Alexander Dobkins Family
Cemetery and the Bear Creek Cemetery within the PIP GIS database, particularly in areas where these
cemeteries abut the APE, it is recommended that accurate boundaries be recorded for these cemeteries and
that those data be incorporated into the PIP for future planning purposes. The current marked boundaries
of these cemeteries were documented using handheld GPS units during this project. These data will be
provided to the DFW for future development planning purposes related to the PIP; however, it is
recommended that the boundary of each cemetery be recorded with survey grade equipment prior to future
planning efforts. This will allow accurate non-development areas and construction avoidance buffers to be
defined and reduce the potential for inadvertent disturbance to take place within these cemeteries.

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further cultural resources investigations are
recommended within the APE. However, if evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware, grave
monuments, or human remains are encountered during construction activities, the operators should
immediately cease work in the area of the inadvertent discovery. The project environmental consultant
should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC prior to resuming construction
activities.

Mr. Wolfe
Enclosed please find one unbound copy of Integrated Environmental Solutions' cultural resources report titled
Cultural Resources Survey of Project Blue Sky, City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. As the project will occur
on DFW International Airport property, the DFW International Airport is seeking approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration to modify their Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. In addition, as the DFW
International Airport is a political subdivision of the state and ground-disturbing activities for Project Blue Sky will
exceed five acres the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. As such, the
survey was conducted to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Antiquities Code of Texas, and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Archeologists Kevin Stone, Joshua Hamilton and Anne Gibson
conducted the cultural resources inventory on 2 October 2015, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7373, to evaluate
if the proposed project would impact any archeological sites and/or historic properties. The survey was conducted
within an approximately 43.46-acre area located northwest of the intersection of Texas State Highway 360 and Trinity
Boulevard.
No cultural resources were encountered during the survey. As such, it is the recommendation of IES that Project
Blue Sky be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any
cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should cease work immediately in that area, and
the THC/SHPO should be contacted prior to resuming any construction activities.

Airport/Permit #73 73/THC Track 201602395)

Dear Mr. Stone:
Thank you for submitting to us the draft report (interim report 1 for permit #7373) referenced above. This
letter serves as comment on the federal undertaking from the State Historic Preservation Officer, the
Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The review staff, led by Rebecca Shelton, has completed its initial review. The archeological fieldwork
and archival research appears to be fine for the area within Tranche 4. However, in order to complete our
review, we require additional information and clarification throughout the report.
For site revisits to 41 TR 17, 41 TRI 8, 41 TR20 and 41TR24 l , can you clarify how the site revisits verified
the National Register eligibility determinations as listed in the THC determination database? Sites
41 TR 17, 41 TR 18, and 41 TR24 l are Iisted as ineligible in the THC database, and no further
investigations were recommended from the previous evaluations. Site 4 1TR20 has not been fully
delineated, and is of undetermined eligibility.
In the Summary and Recommendations for the newly recorded sites 41 TR290, 41 TR29 l , 41 TR292,
41 TR293 , 41 TR292, 41 TR295, 4 1TR296 and 41 TR297, please use the National Register criteria to
assess site eligibility. For example, in the site summary of 41 TR291 (p. 36; 5.1.4.3 .4), please reference
Criteria A and/or B, not the Handbook of Texas Online or the TxGenWeb Project to evaluate site
eligibility.
We look forward to reviewing the revised report. Thank )'G!.l for ycur cccperntion in this ;;tate and federal
review process, and for your efforts to preserve the irreplaceable heritage of Texas. If you have any

Thank you for submitting to us the draft report (interim report I of 4 for permit #7373) referenced above.
This letter serves as comment on the federal unde1taking from the State Historic Preservation Officer, the
Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The review staff, led by Rebecca Shelton, has completed its review of the above referenced report. Due
to the absence of intact cultural deposits or association with significant persons, we concur with the
recommendations that sites 41DL523, 41 DL524, and 41DL526 are ineligible for State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) designation or for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
We concur that the portion of site 41DL521 within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) is ineligible for
listing on the NRHP or as an SAL, yet it is of undetermined eligibility outside of the APE due to its
proximity to the Harrington Cemetery (DL-C244) and other remnants of the Estelle community.
In order to complete our review of site 41DL522, please clarify why no shovel tests were excavated at
the site. A1tifacts or features may still be present even after agricultural activities have occurred .
Based on the site description prov ided, we do not concur with the eligibility recommendations for site
41DL525 . Additional shovel test should be excavated to the west and east of the documented features to
better define the site boundaries. Based on Figure 5.5, it does not appear that the site was fully delineated
using shovel testing. In addition, the association of the site to Henry Burgoon and the location of the
general store should be investigated further, as the archival research demonstrates that Burgoon is
potentially a significant figure to the Estelle community.
Additional information needs to be included in the report regarding the Harrington Cemetery that is
shown on Figure 5, as it is approximately I 00 feet southwest of the newly recorded 41 DL52 I in Area I B.

outside of the currently proposed impacts, the Harrington Cemetery is a historic cemetery closely
associated with the Estelle community and has estimated boundaries. The cemetery is endangered due to
vandalism, undetermined boundaries, and its location in a heavily wooded area with no gate securing the
fenced area containing the marked graves. The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas notes that headstones are
likely missing, and the THC cemetery files document depressions that are likely unmarked graves. In
order to establish the historic boundaries of the cemetery, historic maps, archives, deed records,
cemetery, and census records would need to be investigated.
In addition, please address the following editorial comments. In the Abstract, Introduction, and

Dear Mr. Stone:
Thank you for submitting to us the revised draft report (interim repo rt 4 of 4 for permit #7373)
referenced above. This letter serves as comment on the federal undertaking from the State Historic
Preservation Officer, the Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commiss ion (THC).
The review staff, led by Rebecca Shelton, has completed its review of the above referenced report. Due
to the absence of intact cultural deposits or association with sign ificant persons, we concur that newly
recorded sites, 41TR290, 41TR291, 41TR292, 4JTR293, 4JTR294, 41TR295, 41TR296, 41TR297,
and Isolated Find IFl are ineligible for State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) designation or for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). We concur that previously recorded site 41 TR82 is
ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as SA Ls. We concur that site 41 TR20 is of undetermined
eligibility. Site 41TR18, 41TR219, and 41TR241 were previously determined as ineligible by the THC.
Site 41TR17 is ineligible within the right-of-way.
Additional information needs to be included in the report regarding the Bear Creek Cemetery and the
Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery. Although Bear Creek Cemetery (TR-C037) is an active
cemetery, is well maintained and listed as low risk of endangerment in the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (TASA), there is still potential for unmarked graves outside the known cemetery boundaries. T he
earliest interments date to 1858; additional archival research of deed records, cemete1y records, family
histories and census records would need to be examined to identify how the community used the
1
111
cemetery and the adjoining land in the 19 " and early 20 century. Otherwise, an avoidance buffer larger
than 25 feet should be established.
The Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery (TR-C038) is listed as highly endangered in the Atlas due to
undetermined historic boundaries, partial fencing, and poor maintenance. The Tarrant County Cemetery
Records (compiled in the 1950s) states that there is an estimated dozen graves, but that the stones were
removed a nd displaced. The historic boundaries of the cemetery need to be establ ished using historic
maps, archives, deed records, cemetery records, and census records. Please update the discussion on

an avoidance buffer can be established. Please update the Recommendations on Page 71.
In addition, maps with the reported cemetery boundaries should be included in the report showing their
relationship to the project APE. The cemeteries should be discussed by name in the Abstract and

Mr. Wolfe
Enclosed please find one unbound copy of Integrated Environmental Solutions' cultural resources report titled
Cultural Resources Survey of Trigg Lake Access Road, Tarrant County, Texas. As the project will occur on
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the DFW is seeking approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration to modify their Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. In addition, as the DFW is a
political subdivision of the state the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. As
such, the survey was conducted to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Antiquities Code of Texas,
and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Joshua Hamilton and Anne Gibson on 28
September 2015 under Texas Antiquities Permit 7373. During the IES survey, no cultural resources were
documented within the Area of Potential Effects (APE). No further work is warranted.
Â·
Thus, the DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE, a determination of "no historic properties affected" under 36
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800.4(d)(1 ), and the undertaking be permitted to continue without the need
for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction,
the operators should cease work immediately in that area, and the THC/SHPO should be contacted prior to resuming
any construction activities.
If you have questions, please contact me by phone at 972-562-7672 or via email at kstone@intenvsol.com.

Comments - A 2, 705-acre Cultural Resources Survey for the Property Inventory Project, Project Blue
Sky, and Trigg Lake Access Road, Dallas and Tarrant Counties
â¢

In the Abstract, please add to the Sites Table a column that lists the eligibility recommendations
for the NRHP.

â¢

Antiquities permit #7373 was issued for an intensive pedestrian survey; however, it appears from
the description of the surveys within the Introduction and Methodology of the various chapters of
the report that a reconnaissance survey of low potential areas was conducted, while an intensive
survey of High Potential Areas was conducted. The methodology used for the reconnaissance
surveys need to be clarified.

â¢

Please clarify how the 150 foot buffers recommended for Bear Creek Cemetery, Alexander
Dobkins Family Cemetery, and the Harrington Family Cemetery were established without the use
of archival research or known cemetery boundaries. The potential of probable unmarked burials
at these cemeteries requires archival or archeological investigations to define an adequate buffer.
As we noted in our February 3, 20 I 6 response letter for the Tranche 4 draft report, to determine
historic cemetery boundaries, we highly recommend archival research to be conducted to better
understand the historical use of the parcels of land. Without this research, an arbitrary buffer
could be too large.

â¢

Archival research should include review of deed records, cemetery records, family histories and
census records. These records may include a description of the size ofland set aside for a
cemetery, the number of burials, or the name of the cemetery. In addition, the County Historical
Commissions may have information on the cemeteries and the communities that once surrounded
them. In lieu of archival research, mechanical testing is the preferred method to determine where
unmarked grave shafts are present.

â¢

Due to the remoteness of the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery and the Harrington Family
Cemetery from developed areas and the poor fencing and lack of signage, these two cemeteries
are at high risk for inadvertent disturbances during construction activities. Once the avoidance
buffers are better defined, please have DFW Airport provide a letter to the THC stating how these
cemeteries will be clearly identified with avoidance buffers 1narked in the field. The avoidance
buffers should be clearly marked so that the cemeteries will be avoided during construction, not
be within staging zones, or impacted affected by heavy equipment.

Antiquities Code of Texas Project Review of the Property Inventory Project (FAA/DFW Airport/Permit
#7373/THC Track 201608822)

Dear Mr. Wolfe,
On July 28, 2016 the Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued comment for the Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and Antiquities Code of Texas review of the draft report titled A 2, 705-acre Cultural
Resources Survey for the Property Inventory Project, Project Blue Sky, and Trigg Lake Access Road, Dallas and
Tarrant Counties. The draft report was submitted under Antiquities Permit 7373 and processed under THC Track
201608822. Through this review, the THC concurred with the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility
determinations of 22 archeological sites identified and documented within the project's Area of Potential Effects
(APE); therefore, would not require further investigation. However, the THC stated that to complete their review of
the draft report, additional information and clarification would be needed to properly address five comments . Two of
the five comments pertained to minor editorial requests, while the remaining three were substantive and pertained to
cemeteries located directly adjacent to the APE (Attachment A). To address these comments additional field and
archival research efforts were needed. IES is currently working to address the THC's remaining comments, which
will be presented within a final interim report. These comments are summarized below:

Mr. WolfeEnclosed please find one unbound copy of the draft cultural resources report titled Cultural Resources
Investigations of Historic Cemeteries for the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Property Inventory
Project, Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas. As the overall DFW Property Inventory Project will involve
approval from the FAA for alterations to the Airport Layout Plan, it is subject to the provisions of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. In addition, as DFW is a political subdivision of the State of
Texas, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Therefore, this
investigation was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 7373.
Through coordination for the previous cultural resources inventories of Tranches 1 and 4, the THC
determined that further investigations were needed to sufficiently assess for the presence of unmarked
graves located outside of the historical boundaries of each cemetery and within the APE. Archival
research was conducted to identify the historic limits of each cemetery. Through archival research, it
was determined that sufficient information documenting the legal metes and bounds of the Bear Creek
Cemetery was obtained and no additional field investigations were deemed necessary. Due to the lack
of records pertaining to the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery and the Harrington Family Cemetery, it
was determined that additional field investigations were necessary. Therefore, vegetation clearing,
mechanical scraping, and backhoe trenching was conducted within the APE adjacent to the marked
perimeters of the Harrington Family Cemetery and the Alexander Dobkins Family Cemetery. No human
burials, evidence of grave shafts, coffin-related hardware, or grave monuments were encountered
within the APE during these investigations. As such, no further investigations at these cemeteries are
warranted within the APE. A 25-ft avoidance buffer surrounding the Alexander Dobkins Family
Cemetery and the Bear Creek Cemetery is recommended to protect these cemeteries from potential
future construction impacts.
If you have questions regarding this report or these recommendations, please contact me by telephone
at (972) 562-7672 or via email (kstone@intenvsol.com).
