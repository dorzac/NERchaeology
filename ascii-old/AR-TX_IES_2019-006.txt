ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of an
archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 549 Improvements Project (CSJ 1015-01-024). The
proposed project will expand and realign a portion of FM 549 southeast of the City of
Rockwall, Rockwall County, Texas. As the project sponsor, the Texas Department of
Transportation, is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the proposed project will
require coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to construction,
per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of this survey was to identify and document any archeological sites that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The archeological survey
was conducted by Principal Investigator Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technicians
Joshua McCormick, Will Maddux, and Toby Settle on 08 January 2019 under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8504. All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 800 and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations
for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. No archeological
resources were documented within the 35.28-acre Area of Potential Effects (APE) as a
result of this survey.
No artifacts were collected during this survey. All project records will be temporarily
stored at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Center for
Archeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No additional
archeological survey or evaluation is recommended within the APE as it is presently
defined. However, if any archeological deposits or features are encountered during
construction, the operators should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the
inadvertent discovery and immediately contact the project cultural resources consultant to
initiate coordination with TxDOT and the THC prior to resuming construction activities.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report presents the results of an archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation - Dallas, LLC on
behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Dallas District, for the proposed Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 549 Improvements Project (CSJ 1015-01-024). TxDOT Dallas District proposes to
expand and realign a portion of FM 549 between State Highway (SH) 276 and SH 205 southeast of the
City of Rockwall in Rockwall County, Texas. The purpose of these investigations was to conduct an
inventory of archeological resources (as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4
[36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and to evaluate identified resources for their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR
800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Administrative Code,
Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]) and was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8504.
This archeological survey was conducted by Principal Investigator Christopher Goodmaster and Field
Technicians Joshua McCormick, Will Maddux, and Toby Settle on 08 January 2019. A total of 32-person
hours was required to complete this fieldwork. Background research, mapping, and geospatial analysis
was performed by Project Archeologist and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialist Thomas
Chapman. IES Vice President and Cultural Resources Director Kevin Stone provided technical review
and quality control of this document and provided general project oversight. This report was compiled
through the efforts of Christopher Goodmaster, Thomas Chapman, and Kevin Stone.
The area of potential effects (APE) for this project is approximately 35.28 acres (ac); however, large
portions of the APE have been subjected to extensive previous disturbances related to the construction
and maintenance of FM 549. Therefore, this investigation focused on identifying high probability areas
(HPA) for archeological resources prior to survey. HPA was defined as portions of the APE not
previously surveyed and not significantly impacted by previous ground disturbances. Pedestrian
reconnaissance was conducted within the 11.61-ac proposed new right-of-way (ROW) portion of the
APE. Intensive pedestrian survey was limited to 6.93 ac of HPA.
No archeological historic properties (as defined in 36 CFR 800.16[1]) or archeological sites eligible for
designation as SALs (13 TAC 26.12) are present within the APE examined during this survey. In
addition, the historic-age Lawhorn Cemetery was determined not to extend into the APE. No artifacts
were collected during this survey. All project records will be temporarily stored at the IES McKinney
office and permanently curated at the Center for Archeological Research at The University of Texas at
San Antonio. No additional archeological survey or evaluation is recommended within the APE as it is
presently defined. Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the FM 549 Improvements Project
(CSJ 1015-01-024) be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations.
However, if any archeological materials or features are encountered during construction, the operators
should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery and immediately contact the
project cultural resources consultant to initiate coordination with TxDOT and the THC prior to resuming
construction activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 Introduction
This report presents the results of an archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation - Dallas, LLC on
behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Dallas District, for the proposed Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 549 Improvements Project (CSJ 1015-01-024). TxDOT Dallas District proposes to
expand and realign a portion of FM 549 between State Highway (SH) 276 and SH 205 southeast of the
City of Rockwall in Rockwall County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
The purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of archeological resources (as defined by
Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project
area and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]). This
project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8504.
A brief description of the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and
historical contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations are
provided in this document. Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002)
guidelines, this report satisfies the NHPA Section 106 and ACT requirements of the proposed project.
Project Description
The project proposes to widen approximately 2.08 miles (mi) of the existing FM 549 from a two-lane
undivided roadway to a four-lane roadway with a 20-foot (ft) center turn lane median between SH 205
and SH 276. In addition to widening the roadway, the project will create a new segment of FM 549
extending south from FM 1139 to SH 205. The new segment of FM 549 will be entirely within the 2.08mi project limit.
Purpose and Need
The current and anticipated population growth in the region has resulted in an increase of residential
development and associated traffic congestion along the project area. According to the North Central
Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) Mobility 2040 population forecast, Rockwall County
population will grow 78 percent from 2017 to 2040. The traffic demand along FM 549 within the project
limits has grown substantially and is expected to continue to grow. The existing road is insufficient to
meet current and projected traffic demands.
The purpose of the FM 549 roadway widening is to improve access by making the existing roadway
continuous, thus relieving congestion especially along SH 205 and improve traffic flow. The proposed
FM 549 improvement project is needed because: (a) the existing route is not continuous, requiring
motorist to use SH 205 to reach either segment of FM 549 and (b) is inadequate to meet current and future
traffic demands.

1.2 Area Of Potential Effects for Archeological Resources
The APE is defined to encompass the limits of the existing ROW, proposed new ROW, permanent and
temporary easements, utility relocations, and project-specific locations. The APE for archeological
resources encompasses the 2.08-mi project corridor and the 100-to-830-ft-wide existing and new ROW
and easements, totaling approximately 35.28 acres (ac).
Description of Existing Roadway
The existing FM 549 roadway within the project limits consists of two 10-ft-wide main lanes with 2-ftwide shoulders. Currently, FM 549 contains ditches and terminates into FM 1139. The existing ROW
within the APE is 23.67 ac.
Description of Proposed Roadway
The proposed FM 549 project would create four 12-to-14-ft-wide lanes with 2-ft-wide shoulders. The
proposed improved roadway would also have a 6-to-18-ft-wide sodded median and 5-ft-wide sidewalks
on both sides of the road. At specific locations, 12-ft-wide turn lanes will be added. A bridge would be
constructed over Long Branch.
Existing culverts would be extended for proposed drainage
improvements. The proposed project would require approximately 11.61 ac of new ROW at various
locations along the corridor. Details of the proposed design are shown on the project schematic, which
has been uploaded to the TxDOT Environmental Compliance Oversight System (ECOS; Attachment B).
Typical Depth of Impacts
Typical depths of impacts would reach an estimated depth of 3 ft to accommodate grading and drainage
improvements typical of multi-lane roadway infrastructure.
Maximum Depth of Impacts
The maximum depth of impacts is estimated to be approximately 70 ft for the construction of bridge piers
within the Long Branch riparian corridor.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Climate
Rockwall County is located in the north-central part of the State of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an annual precipitation averaging approximately 38 inches (in). Precipitation
usually falls as rain throughout the year, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).

2.2 Topography, Geology, and Soils
The Rockwall 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map illustrates that the
APE is located within a gently undulating upland setting situated on the western flank of a dissected
upland ridge that separates the Long Branch and Brushy Creek drainages. Along the dissected margins of
the ridge, the APE crosses the headwaters of two unnamed streams south of SH 276. Within the
southernmost portion of the APE, between FM 1139 and SH 205, the new proposed roadway extension
will cross Long Branch and extend up a gently sloping ridge west of Long Branch before intersecting SH
205. Long Branch flows north-to-south across the APE and confluences with Little Buffalo Creek
approximately 5 mi south of the APE (see Figure 1.2).
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairie
ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Northern Blackland Prairie is distinguished from surrounding
regions by gently-rolling hills and fine-textured, black, clay-rich soils that primarily support prairie
vegetation. Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and consist of high clay content soils that
have significant shrink and swell potential. The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Marlbrook Marl
Formation (Kmb), which is comprised of clay, silt-size quartz grains, phosphate nodules, and marine
megafossils (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987; USGS 2018).
The Soil Survey of Kaufman and Rockwall Counties, Texas (Pringle 1977) indicates that there are four
soil map units within the APE (Table 2.1; Figure 2.1). The entire APE contains soils typical of upland
settings within the Northern Blackland Prairie region. Soil data were reviewed from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil
Survey 2018).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Archeological Sites Atlas Review
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas
(THSA), maintained by the THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and the
TxDOT Historic Districts and Properties of Texas (HDPT) databases identified no previously recorded
archeological sites, NRHP properties or districts, or historical markers located within the APE or within 1
kilometer (km; 0.6 mi) of the APE (TASA 2018; THSA 2018; Figure 3.1). However, one historic-age
cemetery abuts the southern portion of the APE northeast of the intersection of FM 549 and FM 1139.
The Lawhorn Cemetery contains approximately 149 graves dating from 1881 to 1970. The cemetery is
encompassed by a modern fence.
In addition, the TASA database indicates that one previously conducted professional cultural resources
survey has been conducted within 1 km of the APE (Table 3.1). The previous survey terminates within
the current APE and overlaps a 0.05-ac portion of the APE east of the intersection of Haymaker Drive and
FM 549. The survey was conducted in 2006 by AR Consultants, Inc. for the proposed Lake Tawakoni
Water Supply Project by the North Texas Water Municipal Water District. From the APE, the previous
survey corridor extends east and southeast for approximately 31 mi before terminating at Lake Tawakoni
in Van Zandt County (Todd 2006).

3.2 Archeological Resources Potential
In addition to review of the TASA, THSA, and databases, several additional sources were referenced to
determine the overall potential for encountering archeological sites within the APE. These sources
included the Soil Survey of Kaufman and Rockwall Counties, Texas (Pringle 1977), the Geologic Atlas of
Texas (Dallas Sheet), the USDA NRCS digital soil database for Kaufman County, the TxDOT Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the Dallas District, historical USGS topographic maps, the
National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps of
Rockwall County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced map database, and both past and
current aerial photography.
Disturbance Analysis
During the background review, it was established that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use,
transportation development, and prolonged periods of erosion have transpired within the APE. Historical
aerial photography indicates the APE was used for agricultural, pastoral, and transportation purposes
since 1941 and presumably since the late 19th century. The 1918 USDA Rockwall County soil map
depicts present-day FM 549 as a linear, north-to-south oriented roadway that paralleled the western
boundary of Lawhorn Cemetery, north of a perpendicular intersection with present-day FM 1139. By
1953, FM 549 had been realigned to the current configuration, which includes a westward curve north of
the FM 1139 intersection. FM 549 underwent two additional episodes of modification between 1996 and
2008. In 1996, FM 549 was widened and repaved to accommodate residential development within the
immediate area. In 2008, FM 549 was further widened to feature an additional middle turning lane within

the northern and central portions of the APE and drainage culverts were replaced along the alignment.
The FM 1139 shoulder, culverts, and drainage ditches have been regularly maintained since 1996.
A 1,740-ft-long section of the APE between FM 1139 and SH 205 will be realigned within new ROW to
cross Long Branch within a setting that has remained undeveloped since 1953. This section of the APE
was devoid of woody vegetation between 1941 and 1968, based on a review of historical aerial
photographs. Between 1968 and 1981, woody vegetation began to establish within the Long Branch
riparian corridor, which has continued to become increasingly overgrown. Historical and modern aerial
photography indicates the portion of proposed new ROW west of Long Branch has experienced
prolonged erosion since at least 1941. Aerial imagery from 2016 illustrates that a portion of this area was
disturbed during vegetation removal. The portion of the APE east of Long Branch and south of FM 1139
appears to have been less disturbed and is still predominately covered by woody vegetation.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
Previous surveys within North-Central Texas have indicated that the majority of prehistoric sites are
located adjacent to major perennial streams or near springs. Few prehistoric archeological sites have been
previously recorded within the Blackland Prairie uplands of the East Fork Trinity River. Despite previous
archeological investigations for the impoundment of nearby Lake Ray Hubbard, located approximately
3.6 mi to the west of the APE, little is known about prehistoric-period use or inhabitation of the Blackland
Prairie uplands away from major river valleys. According to the TxDOT PALM for the Dallas District,
the northern 1.6-mi portion of the APE has a low to moderate potential for containing shallow and deeply
buried cultural materials in areas that retain contextual integrity (Table 3.2; Figure 3.2). The PALM
indicates the southern 0.5-mi portion of the APE, which includes a 900-ft-long portion of the APE
extending across the Long Branch riparian corridor, contains an elevated potential for the presence of
shallow and deeply buried cultural deposits in areas with a reasonable degree of contextual integrity.
Based on the aforementioned ground-disturbances pertaining to residential and transportation
development, much of the APE north of FM 1139 is not considered to have retained a reasonable
contextual integrity. Subsequently, this portion of the APE has a low potential for containing prehistoric
cultural deposits. The 900-ft section of the APE, south of FM 1139, is considered to have reasonable
contextual integrity and is therefore considered to have the highest potential for containing prehistoric
deposits.

Historic-Period Resource Potential
Previously documented historic-age resources within the vicinity of the APE, and the East Fork Trinity
River valley in general, primarily consist of archeological sites pertaining to late 19 th to mid-20th century
farmsteads, cemeteries, and structures such as culverts, bridges, houses, barns, and outbuildings.
Typically, archeological sites associated with historic-period occupations in the region comprise surficial
or near-surface artifact assemblages and dilapidated, collapsed, or demolished structures. As such, these
resources typically do not retain sufficient integrity of design or association to be considered eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs.
Historically, the landscape within the APE was primarily used for agricultural and ranching purposes. A
review of historical maps and aerial photography was conducted to determine the former locations of
historic-age structures within and immediately adjacent to the APE. Although several historic-age
structures were once located along the existing FM 549 ROW, these structures have long since been
demolished and removed and the ranching/agricultural landscape has developed into a modern residential
suburban environment. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and
structures is problematic, maps depicting these features are available post-1917. The USDA soil map for
Rockwall County depicts seven structures directly adjacent to the APE as early as 1918. Four of these
1918 structures were visually confirmed to have existed into the mid-20th century, based on reviews of
1953 and 1961 aerial photographs. The northernmost of these structures was a farmstead with a dwelling,
a barn, and four outbuildings located approximately 400-ft south of Haymaker Drive on the east side of
FM 549. These structures were demolished by 1981. Moving south, the next early-20th century structure
was a dwelling with two outbuildings located 150-ft north of Wimberley Lane on the east side of FM 549.
The dwelling and outbuildings were demolished by 2008. South of that former structure location, a barn
and outbuilding were located at the intersection with Jams Lane on the west side of FM 549. The barn is
still present on modern aerial photography and is located approximately 200-ft west of the APE. The
final verified structure was a dwelling with three outbuildings located approximately 880-ft south of
Willow Ridge Circle on the west side of FM 549. Modern photography depicts two domestic structures
and an outbuilding in a different configuration currently present at that location. Aerial photography from
1968 depicts two additional dwellings. A dwelling was constructed approximately 300-ft north of
Wimberley Lane on the east side of FM 549. This dwelling is present on modern aerial photography and
is located approximately 100-ft east of the APE. A dwelling and barn were constructed approximately
350-ft north of Jams Lane on the east side of FM 549. The dwelling is present on modern aerial
photography and the barn was demolished by 2013.
The earliest record detailing the location of the Lawhorn Cemetery is the 1918 USDA soil map for
Rockwall County. The cemetery is located approximately 188-ft north of FM 1139 and immediately east
of the APE. The Lawhorn Cemetery served the local Lawhorn family and residents of the nearby
communities. Although internments range in date from 1880 to 1970, the majority of the internments
date to between 1880 and 1930. The original alignment of FM 549 was depicted within the 1918 soil
map, illustrating the road bounded the western limit of the cemetery. Aerial imagery since 1953 indicates
that the cemetery boundary has not expanded. Based on modern aerial imagery, the cemetery measures
approximately 268 ft north-to-south and 145-ft east-to-west.

METHODOLOGY
The archeological survey of the FM 549 Improvements Project (CSJ 1015-01-024) was designed to assess
the potential of the APE to contain archeological resources and to document the presence of such
resources within portions of the APE that retain sufficient contextual integrity for the preservation of
archeological deposits. Prior to field work, IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records
search to determine the presence of previously recorded archeological sites within the APE and within a
1-km radius of the APE. Additionally, ecological, geological, and soils data were reviewed to ascertain
the prehistoric and historic-period archeological potential of the APE. Historical and recent topographic
maps and aerial photography were also reviewed to identify areas of prior ground disturbance that would
affect the presence and integrity of archeological deposits within the APE. The methods and frequency of
shovel test excavations exceed the minimum requirements for fieldwork stipulated by the THC and CTA
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas (CTA 2001).

4.1 Survey Methods
High Probability Area Geospatial Modeling
To develop the High Probability Area (HPA) model for prehistoric archeological site locations, areas
containing moderate to high potential identified within the TxDOT PALM were selected within the APE.
For historic-period HPA, historic-age structure locations identified within historical maps and aerial
photographs were buffered to include a 1-ac area surrounding each identified structural feature. Final
HPA limits were determined by comparing initial probability data to current land use, past disturbances,
previous survey limits, and the combined prehistoric and historic HPA. For example, areas identified as
containing historic-age buildings through archival research, but presently located within a developed
setting, were not considered HPA within the final model. HPA do not denote the specific limits of
intensive survey were expanded or contracted depending on reconnaissance survey field observations.
Areas outside of designated HPA were assessed through reconnaissance survey and review of
construction documents and historical aerial photography.
For the approximately 35.28-ac APE, the intensive pedestrian survey was limited to HPA. This was due
to the extensive prior disturbances documented within the APE by the construction and maintenance of
FM 549. The HPA identified for survey are represented within Figure 4.1. Areas outside of the
designated HPA were assessed through pedestrian reconnaissance, windshield surveys, and/or aerial
photography interpretation. Representative photographs detailing the rationale for designating areas
outside the identified HPA as having negligible potential for preserving intact archeological deposits are
provided in Appendix A. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test
records.
Intensive Survey
In areas with the potential for preserving buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to
the top of culturally sterile soils; typically, the argillic (Bt) or calcareous (Bk) subsoil horizon. Each
shovel test was at least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic
levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened through Â¼-in hardware mesh to
facilitate the recovery of buried cultural material. If high clay content soils were encountered and could
not be efficiently screened, excavated material was troweled through by hand and inspected for artifacts.
Additionally, the physical properties of each arbitrary level were recorded. All shovel test locations were
recorded using hand-held Trimble Geo7x Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators
documented the results of each shovel test on standardized forms.
Although the APE occupies approximately 35.28 ac, the identified HPA acreage was approximately 6.93
ac and pertained primarily to proposed new ROW. Although HPA methodology is not discussed within

the CTA survey standards, using the standards as a guideline, at least 15 shovel tests would be required to
meet the survey standards. However, the number of survey shovel tests varied from this amount based on
the precise limits and intensity of disturbances, erosion, and topography observed during the intensive
survey.
Mechanical Scraping
Approximately 0.06 ac of the APE is within 25 ft of the existing fence surrounding the Lawhorn
Cemetery. Section 2.261(d) of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the TxDOT and the
THC states that survey methods must include mechanical scraping to a depth adequate to determine
whether grave shafts or burials occur in the APE within 25 feet of a known cemetery. To ensure
compliance with the MOA, mechanical scraping and trenching was conducted within a 25-ft-wide buffer
adjacent to the current boundary of the cemetery within the APE (Figure 4.2). As grave shafts are
commonly identified during archeological investigations by rectangular soil stains that differ in color and
texture from the surrounding, undisturbed matrix, specific attention was focused on identifying and
investigating vertical and lateral soil variations. Exposed soil was examined in plan and profile to
identify potential unmarked grave shafts. When soil variations were initially noted, more detailed
inspection was conducted by cleaning the exposed soil profiles with a spade or trowel. Mechanical
scraping was continued until undisturbed subsoil, regolith, or bedrock was encountered. Portions of the
25-ft buffer area were trenched to a depth greater than 6 ft to confirm the absence of modern fill and
verify the absence of interments. Standardized soil descriptions and photographs were recorded along
each excavation profile.

4.2 Curation
No artifacts were encountered during this survey. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. These documents will be organized and
catalogued according to curation repository standards. All field-generated documents will be temporarily
stored at the IES office and permanently curated at CAR.

RESULTS
Background and archival research conducted in preparation for this cultural resources survey indicated
that one prior cultural resources investigation has taken place within 1 km of the proposed APE. No
previously recorded archeological sites are present within the 1-km background research radius. Based
on background information, HPA were identified that exhibited minimal evidence of prior ground
disturbance. During this survey, the proposed new ROW and HPA were subjected to pedestrian
reconnaissance survey and intensive survey via systematic shovel test sampling. Ground surface visibility
was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Due to the proximity of
the Lawhorn Cemetery to the APE, mechanical scraping was conducted within the portion of the APE
that was within 25 ft of the present cemetery boundary. No archeological resources were documented
within the APE.

5.1 Archeological Survey
Pedestrian Survey Observations
The APE is located within a historically agricultural environment that is rapidly transitioning to a
suburban setting. The topography within much of the APE was generally level with gently undulating
and sloping landforms in proximity to the Long Creek riparian corridor. Ground surface visibility varied
considerably and ranged from 0 to 100 percent across the APE. Ground cover ranged from manicured
turf grass within maintained residential lawns to dense woody and herbaceous understory species along
the Long Branch riparian corridor.
The APE includes maintained ROW, suburban residential lawns, agricultural fields, and a riparian
corridor. The portion of the APE north of FM 1139 is extensively disturbed by residential developments,
buried utilities, and drainage improvements (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 10). Field
observations during pedestrian survey of the overall APE verified the presence of previous ground
disturbances, comprised of existing ROW and narrow areas of proposed new ROW along the existing
roadway. A series of drainage easements exist along the existing FM 549 ROW and were most recently
improved in 2017. Numerous utilities are also within and immediately adjacent to the limits of the APE.
A broad, generally triangular depression extends along the east side of FM 549, between the roadway and
the cemetery. It is assumed that this depression represents the soil borrow pit resulting from the
construction of the elevated roadway crown that FM 549 presently occupies as the alignment curves to the
west.
Intensive Survey Results
The intensive archeological survey of the APE utilized a HPA survey method to adequately investigate
portions of the APE that have retained potential for containing archeological deposits. During this
survey, 17 shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE, targeting HPA within proposed new ROW
for the realignment of FM 549 (Figure 5.1). In general, shovel tests were systematically excavated in two
staggered transects within the proposed new ROW across the Long Branch riparian corridor and the
adjacent uplands (Appendix A, Photographs 11 through 16). Soil profiles exposed within shovel tests
consisted of very dark gray to dark gray (10YR 3/1 to 4/1) clay loam that gradually transitioned to grayish
brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay.
Lawhorn Cemetery Investigation Results
The Lawhorn Cemetery was established by William Lawson Lawhorn in the early 1880s as a community
cemetery. The cemetery contains over 150 burials. Most of the interments within the cemetery date to
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with several mid-to-late 20th century graves represented. The current

cemetery boundary measures approximately 268 ft north-to-south by 145 ft east-to-west and occupies an
interfluvial midslope bench and south-facing shoulder slope along an unnamed tributary of Long Branch.
Although the Lawhorn Cemetery was delimited by a chain link fence at the time of the survey, the
historical cemetery boundary may extend outside of the current cemetery fence. As such, monitored
mechanical excavation was conducted to determine if unmarked graves were present outside of the
current cemetery fence within the immediately adjacent portion of the APE.
The area immediately north of the currently fenced cemetery boundary was not accessible during the
mechanical excavation due to an overhead electrical utility pole and associated guy lines located
immediately adjacent to the northwestern corner of the cemetery, as well as a barbed wire fence
separating the adjacent pasture from the proposed new ROW. Therefore, mechanical excavation efforts
focused on the portion of proposed new ROW and existing ROW west of the current cemetery boundary
(Appendix A, Photographs 17 and 18). The existing cemetery fence is approximately 6 m (20 ft) east of
the existing FM 549 ROW limits at its closest point, which occurs at the northwestern corner of the
cemetery (Figure 5.2). A portion of the proposed new ROW will be adjacent to the northwestern
cemetery corner and will increase to approximately 30 m (98 ft) as the FM 549 alignment turns to the
west approaching the intersection with FM 1139. Within the Lawhorn Cemetery, an uninscribed
headstone fragment and socketed pedestal base was observed approximately 1.67 m (5.5 ft) east of the
existing cemetery fence and the H. C. Hoskins family monument was observed approximately 1.98 m (6.5
ft) east of the fence (Appendix A, Photograph 19).
Mechanical scraping was initiated within the existing and proposed new ROW near the northwest
cemetery corner to ascertain the presence of unmarked graves. Dense construction fill, comprised of
gravel, asphalt, concrete, and other modern refuse, was encountered across all of the 25-ft cemetery buffer
area within the APE. Due to the large volume of modern fill present, coupled with the limited area within
the APE in which to stockpile the excavated material, mechanical scraping efforts ceased in favor of
backhoe trenching. Two backhoe trenches were excavated within the 25-ft cemetery buffer area (see
Figure 5.2). Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1 was excavated within the proposed new ROW portion of the APE
parallel to the western cemetery boundary. BHT 1 was placed in a generally north-to-south orientation
approximately 2.5 m (8.2 ft) west of the existing cemetery fence. During excavation, the southern portion
of the trench was re-oriented to follow the limits of the APE. BHT 2 was excavated generally parallel to
BHT 1 approximately 6.5 m (21.3 ft) west of the cemetery fence and within the existing FM 549 ROW.
The presence of a buried fiber optic line paralleling the roadway limited the northern extent of BHT 2.
In total, 50.5 m (165.7 ft) of trenches were mechanically excavated within the portion of the APE adjacent
to the Lawhorn Cemetery. The upper 50 cm of each trench exhibited the dense construction fill initially
encountered during the mechanical scraping effort (Table 5.1). The construction fill was comprised of
sand, gravel, asphalt fragments, and modern refuse including plastic bottles, modern tires, and modern
lumber. Within the northern portion of BHT 1, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) roadway cushion sand
was encountered at a depth of 38 to 50 cm below surface (cmbs) and a 4-in-diameter brass TxDOT survey
monument set in concrete was encountered at 45 cmbs (Appendix A, Photographs 20 and 21). By a
depth of 50 cmbs, the soil profiles exposed within both trenches transitioned to relatively undisturbed
very dark gray to dark gray (10YR 3/1 to 4/1) clay that gradually transitioned to grayish brown (10YR
5/2) silty clay between 80 and 100 cmbs. Within BHT 1, a 2-in-diameter steel pipe related to a
decommissioned rural water supply line was encountered at a depth of 110 cmbs (Appendix A,
Photographs 22 and 23). The steel pipe occupied a 16-in-wide trench and extended for approximately 29
ft (8.8 m) generally paralleling BHT 1. In addition, a 2-in-diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
decommissioned water supply line pipe was encountered within BHT 1 at a depth of 130 cmbs. The PVC
pipe occupied a 4-in-wide trench and extended for approximately 34 ft (10.4 m) along BHT 1, generally
paralleling the steel pipe (Appendix A, Photographs 24 and 25). Grayish brown (10YR 5/2) massive
clay or silty clay subsoil was encountered within both trenches by depths of 100 to 120 cmbs. Within
BHT 1, white chalky limestone regolith was encountered in southern portion of trench at a depth of 220

The current boundary of the Lawhorn Cemetery does not appear to have changed since the early 1940s,
based on a review of historical aerial photography. The uppermost 50 cm of the area investigated
adjacent to the cemetery contained recent construction fill as a result of the use of the area for
construction staging during the 2017 roadway maintenance and culvert replacement project. In addition,
two rural water supply pipelines were previously placed parallel to the western cemetery boundary. No
human remains, evidence of grave shafts, grave monuments, or coffin-related hardware were encountered
within the portion of the APE investigated adjacent to the Lawhorn Cemetery.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During this archeological survey, the 35.28-ac APE was investigated through pedestrian reconnaissance
with selective intensive survey within HPA. Seventeen negative shovel tests were excavated within the
6.93-ac HPA. No archeological sites were identified during either the pedestrian reconnaissance survey
of the APE or intensive survey of the designated HPA. In addition, the portion of the APE within 25 ft of
the Lawhorn Cemetery was investigated by monitored mechanical scraping and backhoe trenching. No
human remains, evidence of grave shafts, grave monuments, or coffin-related hardware were encountered
within the portion of the APE investigated adjacent to the Lawhorn Cemetery.
No archeological resources eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (as defined in 36 CFR 800.16[1]) or
designation as SALs (as per 13 TAC 26.12) are present within the APE examined during this survey.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the FM 549 Improvements Project (CSJ 1015-01-024) be
permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any
cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators should immediately cease
construction activities in those areas. The project cultural resources consultant should then be contacted
to initiate further consultation with the THC and TxDOT prior to resuming construction activities. In
addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within this report are to be
impacted, additional field investigations may be required.
