ABSTRACT

During the middle of June of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 15.14 acres
for the proposed Glen Rose Housing Development which Red Mortgage
Capital, Inc. intends to construct about 3.2 miles northeast of Glen Rose in
Somervell County, Texas. The study area is located southwest of and
adjacent to FM 200 and southeast and adjacent to the Rainbow Baptist
Church. No cultural materials were found on the ground surface or in 13
shovel tests excavated during the archaeological survey. However, a
buried quartzite primary flake was recovered in a shovel test on a knoll but
since no other cultural materials were found in 4 shovel tests within a 5
meter radius of the flake, it is considered an isolated occurrence. The
presence of the flake, however, is indicative of the aboriginal occupation
on topographic elevations along Squaw Creek and the Brazos River.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted
and that Red Mortgage Capital, Inc. be allowed to construct the housing
development. However, if cultural materials are encountered during the
construction of the proposed development, work should stop immediately
in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Red Mortgage Capital, Inc. intends to construct multi-family residences on approximately
15.14 acres located about 3.2 miles northeast of the center of Glen Rose in Somervell
County, Texas. The proposed housing development is located southwest of and adjacent
to FM 200, southeast of and adjacent to the Rainbow Baptist Church and approximately
250 feet slightly southeast of the intersection of FM 200 and CR 303 (Figure 1).
Red Mortgage Capital intends to acquire a Federal Housing Administration Loan for the
construction of the residences; therefore, the Texas Historical Commission acts as the
Section 106 agency and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
requested an archaeological survey of the development tract in a letter dated April 30,
2008.
Jesse Todd of AR Consultants, Inc. conducted the intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed development tract on June 18, 2008. The purpose of the
archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials older than 50 years were
present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and how they might
be impacted by construction.
This report follows the guidelines used by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND) and
accepted by the Texas Historical Commission. The following report presents a brief
description of the natural environment and previous archaeological investigations of the
study area. This is followed by a description of the methodology used during the survey.
The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last
chapter presents conclusions and recommendations that arise from the study. A list of
references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL HISTORY
The proposed housing development is located within the Glen Rose Prairie which is a
part of the Grand Prairie (Hayward et al 1992:9). The Grand Prairie forms a belt of
grassland and savannah, but the Glen Rose Prairie is more rugged and rockier.
The underlying bedrock within the study area is the Lower Cretaceous-aged Glen Rose
Formation which consists of limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The
proposed housing development is to be constructed within the Bastrop-Yahola Soil
Association which consists of sand and loams on terraces and bottom lands (Coburn
1978:General Soils Map). Soils consist of Bastrop fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent
slopes and eroded Bastrop fine sandy loam with 1 to 5 percent slopes (Coburn 1978:Sheet
37). The B horizon is listed as being 13 inches (30 cm) bs and it has a yellowish-red color
and consists of sandy clay loam (Coburn 1978:46).

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The major survey done in Somervell County was for the Squaw Creek Reservoir (Skinner
and Humphreys 1973). Twenty-seven sites were recorded in 3,200 acres (one site for
every 118.5 acres). Prehistoric site types include lithic scatters, burned rock middens,
camp sites and shell middens. Prehistoric sites range in age from 8,000 BC to 1500 AD
although the majority of the occupation was during the Late Archaic. Historic site types
include a farmstead, chimneys, trash scatters and a lime kiln and date to the 19th and 20th
century. This survey was followed by the excavation of the Hopewell School site
(41SV30) which was found during the reservoir survey and was a Late Archaic camp site
(Gallagher and Bearden 1976). Approximately 300 square m of the site were excavated.
A variety of lithic tools, dart points, hammerstones, cores, bifaces and ground stone tools
were recovered as were animal bones. Site SV153, which was discovered during the SH
144 archaeological survey, also was tested to determine if it was eligible for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places (Griffin and Boyd 2006). The site consisted of
scattered fire-cracked rock, rock features and very few artifacts and was deemed
ineligible.

Numerous sites have been recorded during archaeological surveys of the Dinosaur State
Park, golf courses, pipeline studies and various other type surveys. During the
archaeological evaluation of the Dinosaur State Park, Southern Methodist University
(Gallagher ND) recorded four sites that contained lithic scatters, mussel shells and
midden (trash deposits). No age was given because diagnostic artifacts were not found.
Two of the sites (41SV56 and 41SV57) were tested much later (Turpin 1994). Site
41SV56 contained at least five intact occupational levels and dated to the Late Prehistoric
period based upon radiocarbon samples. Based upon the artifact assemblage type, site
41SV57 was tentatively dated to the Late Prehistoric. In addition, during the testing, three
other prehistoric sites (41SV117 to 41SV120) were recorded and a historic farmstead
(41SV63) was assessed for future impact.
Lemens Rockshelter (41SV60) contained two Late Prehistoric burials, one of which had
associated burial goods. The rockshelter was primarily used as a hunting camp based
upon the amount of arrow points and lithic debris present. One burial was an adult male,
35 to 45 years old, and the other was a four years child. The adult burial contained a wide
variety of burial goods such as lithic tools, polished pebbles, a hammerstone, arrow
points, a fish hook, antler flakers, antler awls and punches, a freshwater mussel and bone
tools. The Late Prehistoric period site associated with the Toyah focus of Central Texas
(Smith 1994:207:256).
Two ceramic bearing sites, the Rodeo Hill and Third Dam, were tested along the Paluxy
River (Smith 1996:67-75). The sites contained burned rock middens, arrow points, lithic
tools, bison and deer bones, bone tools and shell concentrations. The pottery types
consisted of Maydelle Incised and possibly Canton Incised which are Caddoan wares
from Northeast Texas.
The proposed Wheeler Branch Reservoir was investigated by the Brazos Valley Research
Associates (Moore 2005). Approximately 496 acres were investigated but only two 20th
century farmsteads and a dam were recorded. The site/acreage ratio is one site per about
165 acres. ARC (Skinner 1991) investigated electric line improvements (about 10 acres)
and recorded one mid-late 19th century rock chimney. Investigation of the Glen Rose
(Moore 1991) resulted in the recording of four prehistoric sites within approximately 200
acres. Two of the sites (41SV47 and 41SV51) contained rock art and artifacts suggest
that they are Late Prehistoric in age. Interestingly, two obsidian flakes were recovered.
Trask (2007) and Todd (2007) investigated two pipeline routes southwest of Glen Rose
between the Bowden and Barker branches but failed to find any archaeological sites.
The Texas Archeological Atlas (2008) was checked to determine if any archaeological
sites were listed within or adjacent to the proposed housing development tract. None were
listed. The General Highway Map of Hood and Somervell County, Texas (Texas State
Highway Department 1958) did not show any historic structures in or adjacent to the
proposed development tract. However, Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore and
Bradle 1997) conducted an archaeological survey of the Squaw Valley Golf Course
which consists of approximately 260 acres about 1,900 feet west of the survey area and

recorded site 41SV151. The site consists of a prehistoric hearth which was located
approximately 45 cm bs. In addition, site 41SV15 is located approximately 1,775 feet
southeast of the study area and consists of a lithic scatter found on an eroded surface.

METHODOLOGY
The study area was surveyed by walking northeast-southwest oriented transects spaced
30 meters apart. According to the guidelines prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002) and accepted by the Texas Historical Commission, eight shovel
tests needed to be excavated within the study area. This guideline was followed. Shovel
tests were excavated to at least 10 cm into the subsoil. The sandy matrices were screened
through a ¼-inch hardwire cloth screen. No deep testing was conducted due to the
terrace/upland setting. Notes on the topography, soils, vegetation and other relevant
matters were made and photographs were taken.
It was felt that a historic site might be present since the study area is adjacent to a
roadway where other residences are present. Prehistoric sites possibly might be present
since the topographic setting, a knoll, is similar to where sites have been recorded
southeast and south of the study area along Squaw Creek and the Brazos River.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into several parts. The survey area is described and
followed by a discussion of the survey. Shovel tests are described generally in the text but
specific information is provided in Table 1 and shovel test locations are plotted on Figure
6.
Survey area
The study area slopes moderately in all directions from a knoll (Figure 2). Vegetation
includes black-eyed susan, prickly pear cactus, saw greenbriar, bermuda grass, puff weed,
and basket flower along with mesquite and eastern red cedar trees. Ground visibility
ranged from less than 10 percent on the knoll and its eastern slope to 30 to 80 percent
(Figure 3) in the rest of the survey area. The area west of the knoll has been terraced
(Figure 4). The proposed development tract has been plowed and farmed in the past
(Figure 5). A row of of saw greenbriar bushes and eastern red cedar and mesquite trees
runs southeast from the knoll.
Survey
Survey began in the northeastern corner and went southwest. The entire tract was walked,
but, as previously mentioned, the area west of the knoll had been terraced; therefore,
shovel testing was concentrated on the knoll and the area north, east and south of the
knoll.

Shovel tests (hereafter ST) 1 was excavated on the northeast slope of the knoll and STs 2
and 3 were dug on top of the knoll. The shovel tests uncovered very fine sandy loam
overlying very fine sandy clay loam from 21 to 34 cm bs. The sandy clay loam uncovered
in the shovel tests ranged from 61 to 84 cm bs and the clay content increased with depth.
The shovel tests were culturally sterile.
Shovel test 4 was placed on the west side of the knoll and uncovered 27 cm of very fine
sandy loam overlying sandy clay loam that increased with depth. A very fine quartzite
primary flake was discovered at 21 cm bs. Four shovel tests (5-8) were excavated about 5
m south, north, east and west of ST 4 but failed to uncover any cultural materials. Very
fine sandy loam overlying very fine sandy clay loam at depths ranging from 7 to 17 cm
bs and the shovel tests were terminated from 24 to 31 cm bs. Shovel test 9 was excavated
approximately 15 m slightly northeast of ST 4 and encountered 14 cm of very fine sandy
loam overlying very fine sandy clay loam that extended to 23 cm bs. The shovel test was
culturally sterile.
Shovel tests 10 through 14 were culturally sterile. Shovel tests 10, 12, and 13
encountered very fine sandy loam overlying very fine sandy clay from 8 to 21 cm bs and
the shovel tests were terminated from 15 to 36 cm bs. Shovel tests 11 and 12 uncovered
very fine sandy loam at 31 and 18 cm overlying very fine sandy clay loam that extended
to 55 and 36 cm bs.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A buried primary quartzite flake was the only cultural artifact found during the survey
despite the good ground visibility and the excavation of 14 shovel tests. The presence of
the flake in a shovel test on the knoll further indicates that topographic elevations were
occupied, although apparently short term in many cases, along Squaw Creek which is
located west of the study area and the Brazos River south of the study area. The absence
of historic sites probably is due to the preference to use the land for farming.
According to the Soils Book for Hood and Somervell County, the ground surface has
been eroded and this was reflected in the shovel testing. The B horizon was encountered
from 7 to 21 cm bs on the slopes and even top of the knoll. Occasionally, on the knoll, the

B horizon extended to 35 cm bs which is the similar to the depth listed for the Bastrop
fine sandy loam.
Based upon the above information, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and Red Mortgage Capital, Inc. be
allowed to construct the housing development. However, if cultural materials are
encountered during the construction of the proposed housing development, work should
stop in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified.
