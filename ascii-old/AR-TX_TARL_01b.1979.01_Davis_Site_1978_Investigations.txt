Report in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Interagency Cooperation Contract IAC (78-79)-1849 between the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of
Texas at Austin, and Texas Antiquities Committee Permit for Archeological
Investigation No. 192.

August 1979

ABSTRACT
Excavations were carried out at the Caddoan Mounds State Historic
Site in southwestern Cherokee County, Texas, between October 2, 1978 and
December 17, 1978. Caddoan Mounds incorporates a portion of the George C.
Davis Site, an important prehistoric settlement. The purpose of the excavations was to provide clearance for the subsurface installation of 2
septic drain fields associated with a visitor center and superintendent
residence slated for construction by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
The primary component at the Davis Site is early Caddoan, and is
represented by 3 artificial earthen mounds, a large village area, and at
least 1 borrow pit. Two of the mounds served·as platforms for special
function structures, and the third as a receptacle for high-status burials.
Social stratification has also been detected in the village. Higher status
individuals lived in close proximity to the platform mounds, in what have
been termed inner villages. The bulk of the population was removed from
the mounds, living in what has been labelled the outer village. The two
are differentiated chiefly on the basis of the distribution of certain
luxury and imported artifacts. Grog-tempered pottery and arrow points are
common artifacts diagnostic of the early Caddoan component. An earlier,
pre-Caddoan component has also been detected at the site, and is represented
by a light scatter of sandy paste pottery and dart points.
A total of 337 m2 was excavated this season in 5 archeological units.
The plowzone of each unit was removed with the aid of a front-end loader,
and at least 50% of the backdirt of each unit was passed through a ~-inch
screen in order to recover artifacts. The unit floors were then shovelcleaned, trowelled, and examined for disturbances. Potential cultural disturbances were cross-sectioned to permit an investigation of their true
origins.
In general, the aboriginal features and artifacts in both drain
fields are typical of outdoor activity areas within the early Caddoan outer
village. One sandy paste sherd, a second sherd which may be of the type
Marksville Incised, a dart point fragment, and a possible dart point preform indicate limited activity in both drain field areas during the preCaddoan occupation. Aboriginal activity in the area of the visitor center
drain field subsequent to the abandonment of the early Caddoan settlement
may be represented by 2 sherds tentatively identified as brushed. The
presence of a Gahagan biface fragment, a siltstone earspool fragment, and 4
Red River pipe stems in the residence drain field may indicate secondary
distribution after breakage of these high-status artifacts from the inner
villages to the outer village. Vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains
recovered from a trash-filled pit indicate a concentration during the
early Caddoan occupation upon the exploitation of species within the upland
forest which would provide a maximum meat yield with a minimum of effort.

INTRODUCTION
The following is a report of the results of archeological investigations conducted at the Caddoan Mounds State Historic Site between October
2, 1978 and December 17, 1978. The work was carried out pursuant to Interagency Cooperation Contract IAC (78-79) No. 1849 between the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Prior permission for the excavations was granted by the Texas Antiquities
Connnittee in Permit for Archeological Investigation No. 192. The principal investigator was Dee Ann Story. The excavations were carried out by
a six-member crew under the supervision of Ulrich Kleinschmidt and Peter
Thurmond.
Caddoan Mounds, a State Park in central east Texas, encompasses a
portion of an important prehistoric settlement, the George C. Davis Site
(41 CE 19). The site is in southwestern Cherokee County, on a high alluvial terrace of the Neches River (Fig. 1). The major occupation of the
Davis Site has been identified as early Caddoan (Newell and Krieger 1949:
236-237; Story and Valastro 1977: 77), and is represented by three artificial earthen mounds, a large village area, and at least one borrow pit.
Sandy paste pottery and dart points are present at the site, and apparently represent an earlier, pre-Caddoan occupation (Shafer 1973: 20-33).
The need to preserve and develop this important archeological site
for the general public led to the establishment of the State Park in 1975.
The Parks and Wildlife Department plans to build an interpretive facility
for visitors and a residence for the park superintendent. The locations
of the planned structures were finalized after extensive testing in 1977
by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory identified the northeastern corner of the park as most suitable for development. The fall
1978 excavations were consequently designed to focus upon the actual locations slated for construction.
The results of the excavations in those two areas are the subject
of this report. Previous archeological investigations at the site, and the
excavation objectives and methods implemented this season, are briefly reviewed. The cultural features and artifacts are described and interpreted.
Finally, a general interpretation of the areas excavated is attempted
within a framework of internal site structure. Attached appendices provide the results of the analyses of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal
remains.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Four professional archeological investigations have been conducted
at the Davis Site prior to the fall of 1978. The first occurred from 1939
to 1941 under the joint auspices of the Works Progress Administration and
The University of Texas at Austin. In this excavation, H. Perry Newell
directed an intensive investigation of Mound A and a portion of the immediately surrounding village. Over 30 structures were identified on
mound platforms and on the terrace surface adjacent to and beneath the
mound. In a published report of the excavations (Newell and Krieger 1949:
234), the primary component at the site was identified as early Caddoan.
The Alto Focus of the Gibson Aspect was defined on the basis of this component. Krieger divided the Caddoan occupatibn into three temporal
phases on the basis of his interpretation of Mound A construction stages
and the vertical distribution of artifacts in the village area (IbLd_:
233-234).
Krieger's analysis was a seminal work, and has been a basic foundation for the development of an understanding of the Davis Site and the
Caddoan area in general. However, the validity of his three intrasite
temporal phases now seems dubious, and radiocarbon dating has established
the date of the initial Caddoan settlement of the site as later than
Krieger believed. Further, as an increasing data base in the Caddoan area
has permitted the investigation of cultural processes and patterns at a
spatially and temporally more discrete level, the utility and validity of
broad concepts like the Alto Focus have also become quite doubtful.
The western portion of the site was explored from 1968 to 1970
in excavations made possible by grants from the National Science Foundation, and by interagency contracts between The University of Texas at
Austin, the Texas Building Connnission, and the Texas Historical Survey
Committee. Dee Ann Story of The University of Texas at Austin directed
the excavations, which concentrated on Mounds B and C, portions of the
village, and a borrow pit on the western terrace slope. The results of
the 1968-70 excavations are, as yet, largely unpublished (but see: .Shafer
1974; Arnold 1975; Story and Valastro 1977). However, an account of the
excavations is available in a preliminary report to the funding agencies
(Story 1972), and a number of theses and dissertations have concentrated
on the data provided by these excavations (Arnold 1973; Shafer 1973;
Keller 1974; Fritz 1975; Spock 1977).
The increased sample of the site provided by the 1968-70 excavations permitted interpretation of the major features and of the internal
structure of the site. Mounds A and B were seen to be analogous in their
associations with special function structures which were deliberately destroyed and capped with earth, and in their accretion through several such
construction events. The two mounds and their associated structures were
termed inner precincts, and were believed to be centers of connnunal or
ceremonial activity. Surrounding the inner precincts were socially distinct village areas, called inner villages, the residents of which had

3
access to imported or luxury artifacts. The bulk of the village, termed
the outer village, was removed from the inner precincts, and was characterized by the absence of such artifacts. The combined village was defined,
on the basis of surface debris, as a U-shaped area of approximately 20
hectares, paralleling the edges of the terrace and crossing its center in
the vicinity of Mound A. Mound C was interpreted as a special mortuary
lying somewhat beyond the edge of the village. It had been raised in five
stages to contain the burials of a small number of presumably high status
individuals. Many of the burials were characterized by rich offerings,
and multiple interments occurred (Story and Valastro 1977: 65). A depression on the western terrace slope was found to be a borrow pit which had
presumably served as a source of mound fill. The pit was not of sufficient
size to account for the three mounds, and other fill sources certainly re.main to be identified, presumably in similar·topographic settings. The
aboriginal excavation scar contained a complex laminated deposit of backdirt, occupational debris, and slopewash, into which a single human
burial had been carelessly placed (Story 1972: 98-101).
The excavations carried out at the Davis Site in 1977 and 1978
have fallen within the realm of cultural resource management, in contrast
with the earlier, purely research-oriented investigations. In 19i5, that
portion of the site which lies to the west of State Highway 21 and south
of Weeping Mary Road was purchased by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for preservation and development as a State Historic Site. Plans for
the development of the park include the construction of an interpretive
center for visitors and a residence for the park superintendent. Department officials naturally wish to avoid disturbance of the archeological
site in placing the facilities. It appeared after the 1968-70 investigations that the northeastern portion of the park was beyond the bounds of
the village area. However, the area remained largely untested, as it had
been covered by a peach orchard at that time.
Therefore, the Parks and Wildlife Department contracted with the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in the fall of 1977 to conduct
extensive testing within the area formerly occupied by the orchard to delineate an area suitable for the development of park facilities. The
excavations, directed by Dee Ann Story and supervised by Ross Fields, revealed that the village area was considerably larger than previously
realized, extending at least 120 m. to the east of Mounds B and C. Village
remains were found to the northeast of and in close proximity to Mound C,
in contradiction of previous interpretations. However, the basic inner
village/outer village dichotomy was upheld, although the inner village
about Mound A appeared to be larger than originally believed. On the
basis of the sample derived by both the 1968-70 and the 1977 excavations,
it was suggested that construction be limited to the extreme northeastern
corner of the park (Fields 1977: 30-31).
A fourth controlled excavation took place in the summer of 1978
in the area north of Weeping Mary Road and west of State Highway 21. The
property is owned by the Texas Forest Service, which plans to modify it
for use as seed beds. The process involved would disturb any archeological remains present. The Forest Service therefore contracted with
the Anthropology Laboratory of Texas A&M University to extensively test

the area. Excavations conducted under the supervision of Darrell Creel
have established that the village area extends to the north of Weeping
Mary Road (Creel 1978: 13-14). The final report on the results of these
excavations is presently in preparation.

1978 EXCAVATIONS
Objectives
In accordance with Fields' recommend~tions, the Parks and Wildlife
Department proceeded to finalize the locations of the planned structures
in the northeastern corner of the park (Figures 1 and 2). The Department
then contracted with TARL in the fall of 1978 to conduct the excavations
reported herein. The original interagency contract called for intensive
testing of all areas to be effected by the construction, to ensure that no
significant archeological remains were present. However, such remains
were identified early in the season at the planned locations of the two
septic drain fields which will be associated with the visitor center and
residence. The objectives of the archeological program were therefore
changed to provide for the mitigation of cultural remains occurring in the
drain field areas. Construction plans were modified to have the structures
raised above the surface on gravel pads, protecting any cultural remains
beneath them.
To meet the excavation objectives as ultimately defined, approximately 62% of the area to be covered by the visitor center drain field was
excavated in three excavation units (Units 59, 60, 61), totaling 192 m2 in
area. Of the residence drain field, approximately 80% was excavated in
two excavation units (Units 62 and 63), which totalled 145 m2 in area
(Fig. 2). Excavation at the Davis Site is a slow and painstaking process,
due to the often faint and diffuse character of the cultural features.
The total area to be disturbed by drain field construction could not have
been investigated with sufficient care to ensure the detection of any but
the most readily visible features. It was therefore deemed preferable to
investigate carefully a suitably large sample of the areas to be effected.
In this manner, it was possible to determine with confidence the. density,
distribution, and character of the cultural features occurring within the
drain field areas (Figs. 5 and 7).
Field Methods
The excavation units were oriented with the reference grid previously established at the site for reasons of practical convenience, and
to maintain consistency with past excavations. The two drain fields were
triangulated onto a grid map of the site from the Parks and Wildlife construction plans. The 1977 TARL excavations (Fields 1978: 4) and the 1978
Texas A&M excavations (Creel 1978: 4) utilized a 6x8 m excavation unit.

The larger 6xl0 m unit was chosen as a balance between the desire for
consistency with the 1977-78 investigations and the objective of clearing
the areas by the most efficie~t means possible. In laying out the units
on paper, it was found that the construction areas could be sampled to a
satisfactory extent with fewer units using a 6xl0 m unit. Additional areas
were opened around the margins of the units, as time permitted, to increase
the area sampled or to investigate patterns of features which seemed to
extend beyond the original unit boundaries (Figs. 5 and 7).
A front-end loader was used to remove the disturbed plowzone
soil to a depth of 25 to 30 cm below the surface (Fig. 4) . The unit floors
were shovel-cleaned, trowelled, and examined for disturbances. Any disturbance suspected of representing a cultural feature was examined in profile
by means of a trowel-excavated cross-section trench. Where possible, the
remainder of the fill was then removed from the disturbance. A feature
number (e.g., Fl92) was assigned to each excavation unit, and sub-feature
numbers (e.g, Fl92-l, 2, 3 ••. ) were assigned to all disturbances investigated. Detection elevations and triangulation data were recorded for each
disturbance. The latter were immediately plotted onto unit plans to
facilitate the identification and investigation of any patterns which might
appear. Each disturbance was drawn in plan and profile, was described
verbally, and where ?Ppropriate, was photographed. Botanical, matrix,
pollen, and radiocarbon samples were collected. The fill was passed through
1/4-in. and 1/16-in. hardware cloth, the latter with the aid of water,
where artifacts were present or conditions suggested the preservation of
faunal or charred plant remains to be likely.
At least 50% of the tractor-excavated backdirt from each unit was
dry-screened through 1/4-in. hardware cloth in order to recover artifacts
for analysis, and to establish artifact densities for the areas excavated.
To increase the accuracy of the vessel count which has been made on the
potsherds from Fl93-l in Unit 62, 100% of the plowzone above and bordering upon that feature was screened.
CULTURAL FEATURES
Introduction
Previous investigators at the Davis Site have uniformly lamented
the often faint and diffuse character of the cultural features (Spock 1977:
18; Fields 1978: 5; Creel 1978: 4). Spock attributes this problem to the
lack of stratigraphy near the terrace surface. Whatever the processes
which cause this phenomenon may be, its practical significance for the archeologist is that feature identification and interpretation are quite difficult
and complex.
The manner in which our excavation strategy was designed to cope
with the problem of feature identification has been discussed above. The
importance of the phenomenon to archeological interpretation is that there
can be no clear-cut, rigid formula for the differentiation of cultural

6

features from natural disturbances. Rather, an individual judgment must
be made of each disturbance, weighing all of the data available. In most
cases, it has been possible to identify a disturbance with confidence as
either cultural or natural in origin. However, the data on some disturbances are problematic, and although cultural origins are suggested, such
a classification without reservations would be deceptive.
Therefore, an attempt is made in this analyis to accomodate that
difficulty of interpretation through a statement of levels of confidence.
Definite cultural features are those disturbances for which an identification as cultural can be made with confidence. Possible cultural features
are disturbances for which classification is problematic. Non-cultural
disturbances are those which can be definitely identified as the product
of some natural agent, usually root or burrowing rodent activity. Shape
is given the greatest weight in this classification, particularly where
the shape of a distinctive type of cultural feature or natural disturbance
can be recognized. The presence of cultural inclusions in the fill and
patterning of disturbances are considered corroborative evidence for an
identification as definitely cultural.
Further, cultural features are classified chronologically as either
modern or aboriginal. Modern features are those which presumably originated
during historic times as a result of Anglo-American activity. These features contained plowzone soil or historic artifacts. They were quite
distinct and well-defined, and their fill was relatively loose. Aboriginal
features are those which are obviously of much greater antiquity, given the
compactness of their fills, the relative diffuseness of their margins, and
the overall faintness of the contrast between their fills and the surrounding matrix. Many contained aboriginal artifacts, or resembled distinctive
types of aboriginal features. Most (if not all) of the aboriginal features
probably date to the Caddoan occupation. In all instances in which a
feature contained artifacts, the artifacts were Caddoan. However, features
which did not contain artifacts cannot be definitely assigned to a specific
component.
Description
A total of 207 disturbances was investigated. Twenty-three definite
cultural features and 10 possible cultural features have been identified.
Of the definite features, 3 are modern in origin, and 20 are aboriginal.
One of the possible features has been interpreted as modern, and the other
9 are classified as aboriginal in origin. The remaining 174 disturbances
investigated have been interpreted as non-cultural in origin, and include
both relatively recent and ancient natural disturbances. Only disturbances
believed to be cultural in origin (referred to herein as "features") will
be described.
The definite and possible cultural features are illustrated in plan
and profile as they appeared at the level of detection (Figs. 5-11), and
are described in tabular form (Tables 1 and 2). A standard set of attri-

butes is used to describe each feature in the tables. Included are location, shape in plan and profile, dimensions, character of fill, nature of
cultural inclusions, and any relevant remarks (i.e., concerning definition
of margins, presence of biotic disturbance, etc.). Each feature is classified as either definitely or possibly cultural, of modern or aboriginal
or1g1n. Finally, the feature is placed within a general descriptive
category. Where possible, an attempt has been made to identify the general
function of the feature (e.g., posthole, seedling auger hole). However,
many of the features have been placed in purely descriptive categories
(e.g., basin-shaped pit, charcoal-filled pit), as their functions are unknown.
Due to its relative complexity, Fl93-l in Unit 62 is described in
narrative form below. For comparative purposes, however, a summary description of that feature appears in Table 2.
Fl93-l
This featu~e was a large, trash-filled pit, which would be termed
a miscellaneous pit under Spock's (1977: 139) classification of cultural
features. The pit was oval in plan at the base of the plowzone (Figs. 7
and 11). Its walls rose at steep angles from a floor which was oval in
plan and basin-shaped in profile. A localized overhang of undisturbed B
horizon sandy clay occurred in the western wall of the pit. The margins
of the pit were locally difficult to define due to the extensive rodent
disturbance, but were generally distinct. Horizontal dimensions of the
feat1Jre at detection level were 2.40 m (east-west) by 1.80 m (north-south).
Maximum vertical extent below detection elevation was 1.02 m.
The pit was not within a domicile or other large structure (Fig.
7). Nor was it covered by a smaller protective structure with support
posts extending below the depth of the present plowzone (25-30 cm). It
is quite possible that a structure with shallow supports or a simple surficial roof covered the pit. Recent cultivation of the site would have
destroyed any evidence of such a protective covering.
There was no discernible evidence that the pit was lined with
puddled clay, cane matting, or any other material. A perishable lining
could have decomposed without leaving a trace. However, artifacts of
Zone 10 were found in direct contact with the pit floor, leaving detailed
impressions in the sandy clay. Presumably, had any lining material
originally been interposed between such artifacts and the floor, the
weight of the fill above would have pressed that material into the floor
prior to its disintegration, leaving analogous impressions. Nor was there
any evidence of in situ burning in either the floor or walls of the pit.
Digging stick marks were not discernible around the pit margins. but
could have been largely masked by biotic disturbances.

16
The pit contained 17 distinct strata of fill, which varied considerably in color, texture, quantity of ash and organic matter, and contents
(Figs. 10 and 11, Table 3). Figure 10 is a simplified profile of the
feature, in which rodent and other biotic disturbances are not shown.
Major divisions of the fill are designated by Arabic numerals. Capital
letters have been added as suffixes to indicate important subdivisions.
The sequence of numbers designating the strata is not continuous. Apparent
divisions of the fill which were tentatively identified and assigned
designations during profiling of the cross-section trench walls were judged
falacious and eliminated during removal of the bulk of the pit fill.
The strata at the base of the pit were basin-shaped, but that concavity decreased upward by zones. The highest strata, above Zone 4A,
were practically horizontal. There was no evidence of in situ burning
anywhere within the pit fill. The heavy concentrations of charcoal and
burned clay which characterized some strata appeared as many small fragments thoroughly mixed with the pit fill. This would suggest that the
material was dumped into the pit after being collected from another location. Variations in color, texture, and density of inclusions also suggested basket loading, especially in Zone 5. In fact, Zone 16, which is
a very distinctive lens of ash in the lower portion of the profile, appeared
to represent a single basket load. This zone could be clearly traced
sloping from its presumed impact point in the southwestern corner of the pit
to the north-northeast, across the upper surface of Zone 12. Further, unburned fauna! specimens and artifacts were freely mixed with charcoal and
burned clay throughout the profile. No lenses of wash were present within
or between the fill strata.
The soil of the Davis Site is an Ultisol which formed on Pleistocene fluvial deposits of the Neches River, and is normally quite acidic
(the pH of the argillic horizon 2 m to the south of Fl93-l was 4.5). Thus,
the preservation of organic materials such as bone and shell is normally
quite poor at the site (Story 1972: 98). However, preservation of faunal
remains was unusually good within the fill of Fl93-l, particularly within
and below Zones 5 and 16. Apparently the high concentration of exchangeable bases in those ash deposits modified the pH of the pit fill to a
level which was ideal for such preservation. Fill from Zones 5 and 8
yielded pH readings of 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. Preservation of faunal
material above Zone 5, and within those parts of the lower strata not
overlain by Zones 5 and 16, was relatively poor. Presumably the downward
transport of soluble bases by percolating precipitation served to neutralize the non-ash fill beneath those two strata. The results of the
analyses of the vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains appear below,
in Appendices 1 and 2.
Numerous instances were noted of somewhat vertically oriented
faunal specimens extending between adjacent horizons. In each case, the
specimen had presumably been introduced with the lower of the two horizons, and had come to rest so as to protrude above the surface of that
horizon. Introduction of the succeeding stratum would then have buried
the exposed end of the specimen. In no instance was there any discernible
difference in preservation between the upper and lower portions of such
specimens.

17
Radiocarbon assays of woody charcoal from three strata within
Fl93-l, Zones 4A, 5, and 10, have been made by the Radiocarbon Laboratory
of the University of Texas at Austin. Samples from various locations within each stratum were mixed to obtain quantities sufficient for dating.
Only fragments of woody charcoal of sufficient size to be identified as
such were submitted for analysis. Corn and cane are therefore definitely
not included. The ages indicated for each stratum are listed below.
Both the uncorrected dates and corrected dates using the Arizona dendrochronological correction (Damon, et al., 1974) are provided. The ranges
provided with the midpoint ages represent one-sigma deviations.

Discussion
Visitor Center Area
A total of 12 definite cultural features and 5 possible cultural
features was identified in Units 59, 60, and 61 (Fig. 5). Of the definite
cultural features, 3 appear to be modern in origin, and have been interpreted as seedling auger holes. The definite aboriginal cultural features
include 2 large stepped postholes, 5 smaller postholes, and 2 miscellaneous
pits. One of the possible cultural features was modern in origin, and may
represent the scar of a post removal. The 4 possible aboriginal cultural
features may include 1 isolated posthole and ]'miscellaneous pits.
Definite Cultural Features

Fl91-l and 191-2 in Unit 60 and Fl92-55 in Unit 61 were practically
identical in character of fill, horizontal dimensions, and shape in plan
and profile (Figs. 5, 6; Table 1). A similarity of the fill to the present
plowzone, the presence of an iron fencing staple in the fill of Fl91-l,
and their perfect circularity in plan suggest an origin that is historic,
cultural, and machine-dug, probably by a rotary auger. The presence of a
recent peach stump in Fl92-55 suggests the holes may have been drilled to
plant peach seedlings. Fl91-l and 191-2 would then represent locations
at which either no seedlings were planted or, more probably, where seedlings that were planted failed. Peach stumps also occurred in Units 59 and
60, but were of sufficient size to have obliterated any evidence of associated auger holes, if such indeed existed.
The similarity in profile of Fl92-2 and 192-4 to stepped postholes
identified in previous excavations (Spock 1977) argues for an interpretation as definite cultural features, despite their lack of cultural
inclusions. The proximity and similarity of the two to one another is interesting (Figs. 5, 6, Table 1). The features were approximately 50 cm apart
from edge to edge, and were quite similar in size and character of fill.
They were apparently not associated with a structure. Spock (Ibid.: 184)
has suggested that isolated postholes might represent effigy, trophy, or
offering poles. An association with more mundane, daily activities also
seems quite possible.
Fl92-l, 192-3, 192-5, 192-56, and 192-57 in Unit 61 seem to represent an isolated line of small postholes (Fig. 5). The line was 3.95 min
length, and was oriented along a west-northwest to east-southeast axis.
Horizontal spacing of the postholes ranged from 85 to 105 cm (center to
center). The maximum horizontal dimensions of the postholes at the level
of detection showed a narrow range of variation, from 15 to 22 cm. Maximum vertical extent below the average surface elevation of Unit 61 ranged
from 39 to 49 cm. While these figures cannot be assumed to reflect the
original depth of excavation of the postholes, given the presence of the

21
plowzone, they do indicate that the postholes were dug to relatively uniform depths. With the exception of Fl92-5, all contained heavy concentrations of ferruginous concretions (Fig. 9; Table 1). Presumably the
postholes are contemporaneous, and represent the locations of the supports
of a linear, non-enclosed structure, possibly a rack of indeterminate
function. Spock (1977: 183-184) has noted that isolated lines of postholes
are fairly coxmnon in outdoor activity areas at the Davis Site.
The 2 definite miscellaneous pits, Fl91-9 in Unit 60 and Fl92-9
in Unit 61, are quite unlike one another in shape, size, character of fill,
and contents (Figs. 5, 6; Table 1). Fl91-9 was oval in plan, basin-shaped
in profile, with horizontal dimensions of 50 x 25 cm and a depth below
detection of 17 cm. Its fill was a yellowish-brown sandy clay loam, and
contained 1 grog-tempered plain body sherd, 10 ~urned clay fragments, and
numerous small fragments of charcoal. Fl92-9 was roughly circular in plan
and semi-circular in profile, with horizontal dimensions of 26 x 24 cm, and
a depth below detection of 15 cm. Its fill was a yellowish-brown sandy
clay, and contained 1 grog-tempered plain body sherd and numerous small
ferruginous concretions. While definitely the result of aboriginal activity,
the function(s) and significance of such features is uncertain (Spock 1977:
181). The presence of the sherds in the fill of each supports the conclusion that the two were associated with the Caddoan occupation of the site.
Possible Cultural Features

Fl91-8 in Unit 60 was a very curious disturbance (Figs. 5, 6;
Table 1). The character of its fill, particularly in the crisp definition
of the wash laminae, indicates the disturbance is quite recent in origin.
The mixture of plowzone fine sandy loam and argillic horizon sandy clay at
the base of the feature seems to indicate partial refilling, either deliberate or inadvertent, soon after the disturbance was opened. It was
apparently then left open to the elements, as testified by the in-washed
material. A similar scar would probably be produced by digging out a post.
However, there is no evidence that a recent fence row extended across the
area, and the presence of an isolated recent post is puzzling. An interpretation of the origin of the disturbance is therefore speculative and
problematic.
Fl91-13 in Unit 60 is also difficult to interpret. The overall
form of the disturbance suggests a posthole (Fig. 9). However, the irregularity of its outline in the southern part of the profile (Fig. 6) and the
absence of artifacts or charcoal from the fill argue against such an
interpretation.
It is difficult to identify the kind of activity which might have
produced the three possible aboriginal miscellaneous pits in Unit 60:
F191-3, 191-5, and 191-6. The three are quite variable in size and shape
(Figs. 5, 6; Table 1). It is interesting to note that their use, if they
are cultural, left no residues as in the case of a charcoal filled pit or
hearth.

22
Residence Area
Eleven definite cultural features and 5 possible cultural features
were identified in Units 62 and 63 (Fig. 7). ~one was modern in origin.
Of the definite cultural features, there were 2 charcoal-filled pits, 1
basin-shaped hearth, 1 large stepped posthole, 5 smaller postholes, and
2 miscellaneous pits. The possible cultural features included 1 large
stepped posthole or miscellaneous pit and 4 postholes.
Definite Cultural Features

The 2 charcoal-filled pits, Fl93-15 iu Unit 62 and Fl94-l in
Unit 63, although different in shape, were quite similar in size and
character of fill (Figs. 7, ~. 9; Table 2). In each, a layer of dense charcoal at the base of the pit was overlain by relatively sterile brown sandy
loam. There was no evidence of in situ burning around the margins of either
pit. However, a replicative experiment on fire pit origins at the Hoxie
Bridge Site in Williamson County (Bond 1978: 114-118) has demonstrated that
the majority of soil firing occurs in the upper portion of the pit walls.
Any evidence of in situ burning therefore could quite possibly have been
removed by the plowzone. The precise function(s) of charcoal-filled pits
is unknow"Tl. Use in cooking, food curing, tanning, and pottery manufacture
have been suggested (Binford 1967: 1-12; Munson 1969: 83-85; Spock 1977:
179-181). These features usually occur outside of structures at the Davis
Site (Spock 1977: 179).

-·

The only feature encountered in the course of our excavations
which did show signs of in situ burning was Fl93-31 in Unit 62 (Figs. 7, 8;
Table 2). Isolated hearths have. seldom been identified in previous excavations at the Davis Site. One possible isolated hearth was identified
in Unit 1, but this feature (FlOO) may have been associated with a structure which was not identified due to the small size of the excavation
unit (Spock 1977: 156-157). Two possible isolated hearths were identified
in the 1977 excavations, in Unit 34 (Fl82-l) and Unit 35 (Fl78-5). Like
Fl93-31, both contained charcoal and burned clay, but neither showed
evidence of in situ burning. The proximity of Fl93-31 to Fl93-l, 193-15,
and 194-1, which by the charcoal and burned clay in their fill suggest association with fire-related activities, is quite interesting. However,
attempting any interpretations based on the proximity of these features
to one another without testing their contemporaneity through radiocarbon
dating is pointless.
Fl93-8 in Unit 62 apparently represented a large isolated stepped
posthole (Figs. 7, 8; Table 2). It was somewhat smaller than the stepped
postholes in Unit 61 (Fl92-2 and 192-4). Unlike those disturbances, Fl93-8
contained artifacts, charcoal, and charred hardwood nut fragments. The
presence of a grog-tempered body sherd in the fill suggests association
with the Caddoan component. As noted above in the discussion of Fl92-2 and
192-4, the function(s) of isolated posts is not known, and could relate to
both mundane and ceremonial activities.

23
The 5 definite postholes in Unit 63, Fl94-15, 194-17, 194-25, 194-30,
and 194-32, form a line 4.05 m in length which is oriented from southwest
to northeast (Fig. 7). Horizontal spacing of the postholes ranged from
80 to 110 cm (center to center). Horizontal dimensions and maximum vertical
extent below the average surface elevation of Unit 63 varied over relatively
narrow ranges; 16 to 23 cm and 47 to 54 cm, respectively. The postholes
are similar in shape (with the exception of the aberrant Fl94-25) and in
character of fill (Fig. 8; Table 2). All contained flecks and small fragments of charcoal. The presence of a grog-tempered plain body sherd in
the fill of Fl94-17 suggests Caddoan origins for the features. The postholes probably represent the locations of the support posts of a linear
structure like that in Unit 61. As noted in that discussion, such lines
of posts are common at the site, and could represent racks or outdoor
partitions.
The 2 miscellaneous pits were Fl93-l and Fl93-3 in Unit 62. Because it is less complex, Fl93-3 will be discussed first. This feature
was exceptional in the quantity and variety of cultural materials in its
fill. Miscellaneous pits of roughly comparable size, shape, character of
fill, and contents have been identified (Spock 1977: 143-144) in Unit 10
(Fl25-65 and 125-164) and in Unit 16 (Fl64-22, 164-33, and 164-37). In
both units, the features occurred in outdoor activity areas (Story 1972:
86, Spock 1977: 134). As with the previously identified pits, the haphazard distribution of artifacts and charcoal through the fill of Fl93-3
suggests inadvertent inclusion (Spock 1977: 181). There is no evidence of
in situ burning, and the fill seems to represent secondary deposition.
The original function of Fl93-3 and the source of its fill are uncertain.
The large quantity of charcoal and burned clay in the fill suggests a
fire-related activity. The presence of a Hayes arrow point and sherds of
Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed establishes an association with the Caddoan occupation.
Fl93-l was a large miscellaneous pit in Unit 62. The purpose for
which the pit was originally excavated by the aboriginal inhabitants is
uncertain. Its shape and the apparent absence of any lining suggest that
use for the storage of foodstuffs is unlikely. Materials stored in the
pit would certainly have been vulnerable to burrowing rodents, insects,
and moisture. The absence of any evidence of in situ burning indicates
that use as a fire pit analogous to those found at the Greenhouse Site in
central Louisiana (Ford 1951: 104-105) is also doubtful. There indeed did
not appear to be any residues on the walls or floor of the pit to indicate
any use prior to the introduction of the fill. Zone 19 could represent
prior use residue or cleaning remnants. However, the size and shape of
the areas where this fill occurred on the pit floor suggest individual
basket loads. The material probably represents the first few loads thrown
into the pit. Thus, by process of elimination, it seems possible that the
pit was dug simply as a receptacle for trash. Further, given that no wash
entered the pit after excavation and prior to fill introduction, it is
possible that there was no significant time lapse between those events.

24
The fill of F193-l was definitely secondary. Burned and unburned
materials were freely mixed within all fill strata, and basket loading
was clearly visible at times. In no case were all of the sherds of a
broken vessel present in the feature fill. In fact, less than half of
each vessel (often one or two sherds) was typically present.
The fill strata seem to have been introduced in fairly rapid succession, and the fill may have been derived from a single location within
the site. Despite the possible absence of any protective covering, no
wash laminae were identified within the fill, indicating the pit was not
open for any great length of time. The absence of differential preservation of faunal specimens crossing stratum boundaries suggests that the
upper surfaces of the strata were not exposed to the air for long. Sorting
of sherds into vessel batches, detailed in the. section on artifacts, has
revealed that sherds from a single vessel were of ten distributed through
several horizons (Table 14). A striking example is Bowles Creek Plain
vessel No. 8, the sherds of which were recovered from the plowzone of
Unit 62, the detection surface of Fl93-l, Zones 3B, 4A, 4B, and 5, and
from a mixed context that could be either Zone 8 or 10. This phenomenon
is probably not attributable to post-depositional disturbances, considering
its frequency of occurrence and the fact that all identifiable rodent disturbances were cleaned out separately during our removal of the pit fill.
Despite the probability that the pit was filled rapidly with materials from a single location, the division of the fill into 17 distinct
layers indicates a complex history, related to a number of different
(albeit unknown) activities. Further, the radiocarbon data indicate that
the fill is not all contemporaneous. Zones 4 (Tx-3399) and 5 (Tx-3400) do
appear to be roughly equivalent in age, dating 914-1052 A.D. and 886-1024
A.D., respectively. Conversely, a date of 1105-1217 A.D. is indicated for
Zone 10 (Tx-3401). The fills of Zones 4 and 5 thus seem to be at least a
century earlier than that of Zone 10. However, the charcoal samples were
composed of relatively small fragments. · While it was possible to be certain
that only woody charcoal was dated, the specimens were too small to permit
taxonomic or anatomical classification. It is therefore quite possible that
the charcoal within Zones 4 and 5, which were contiguous strata, was derived
from the heartwood of long-lived hardwood species such as hickory or oak.
If so, the indicated age of the fills of those strata would be deceptively
early. If not, the dates suggest reversed stratigraphy, with earlier materials overlying later ones. While interesting, such an occurrence would
not be particularly surprising within a context of secondary deposition.
If the dates indicated by radiocarbon analysis are accurate, the
fill of Fl93-l as a whole may represent a span of as much as 331 years.
However, any attempt to assign an absolute age to the pit fill must be made
with caution. The possibility of a heartwood bias has already been discussed. Further, the probable mixed context of the samples must be kept in
mind. Each date may represent an average of material both earlier and
later than the age indicated. An analogous case of mixed context (Tx-1207)
has been documented in Unit 9, where recent Anglo-American and Caddoan debris had been mixed to yield a date of 1420-1600 A.D. (Arizona corrected
date, T~=5730). This postdates by at least 160 years the apparent abandonment of the early Caddoan component at the site (Story and Valastro 1977:

25
67). Given these considerations, it seems adviseable to limit oneself to
the conservative interpretation that the fill of Fl93-l originated during
or before the first half of the 13th century, but no earlier than the
latter half of the 9th century. This is well within the time span of the
primary Caddoan component, which is believed to date from 780 to 1260 A.D.
(Ibid.).
The fill of Fl93-l seems to be unique in those areas excavated to
date; however, 14 pits of similar size and shape have been identified.
Eight of these (F31-3 through 31-6 and F42-l through 42-4) were located
in and associated with large special function structures covered by Mound
A, and contained unstratified, relatively sterile fill (Spock 1977: 59-62,
89-92). Five such pits (F21, 24, 26, 27, and,28) were detected in the
village area to the immediate north of Mound A. Each pit occurred within
the outlines of several domiciles, but could not be definitely associated
with any single structure. Their fills were unstratified and were either
sterile or contained only a few artifacts and decomposed bone fragments
(Ibid.: 140-142). A fourteenth pit of similar dimensions, Fl46-13, was
identified in Unit 15, 11.5 m north-northeast of (but not necessarily
associated with) a domicile. Its unstratified fill also contained a few
bone fragments and artifacts (Spock 1977: 143).
In summary, Fl93-l represents a pit which was dug during the
Caddoan occupation, apparently in an outdoor activity area and possibly
as a receptacle for trash. It was rapidly filled with dumped material
which may derive from a single location within the site. However, the
variety of fills present in the pit seems to reflect a number of different
activities, and radiocarbon analysis demonstrates that the fill is not all
contemporaneous. Fill introduction apparently occurred between the 9th
and 13th centuries.
Possible Cultural Features

An interpretation of Fl93-7 in Unit 62 is difficult. Its shape
suggests a cultural feature, but there were no artifacts and only a few
possibly rodent-introduced flecks of charcoal in the fill. If it is
cultural, it could have been a stepped posthole, but its crucial e~stern
margin was too diffuse to define unequivocally (Fig. 8).
Of the 4 possible postholes, 3 were in Unit 62 (F193-26, 193-29,
and 193-30), and 1 was in Unit 63 (Fl94-18). The three in Unit 62 were
quite variable in shape, size, depth, and character of fill (Fig. 8;
Table 2). If any are cultural, they apparently represent isolated postholes. Fl94-18 fell quite close to the linear structure in Unit 63, but
was much smaller and more shallow than the postholes which composed that
pattern. Given its physical dissimilarity to those features, an assumption
of contemporaneity should probably not be based on that proximity.

26
ARTIFACTS
Analysis of the 3,180 ceramic, lithic, bone, and shell artifacts
collected during the course of the 1978 TARL excavations is largely patterned after previous studies of Davis Site specimens (Newell and Krieger
1949; Arnold 1973; Shafer 1973; Fields 1978). Burned clay, non-vessel
ceramic, bone, shell, and historic artifacts are treated descriptively.
Wherever possible the vessel ceramics (sherds) have been grouped into the
types previously defined for the site (Newell and Krieger 1949; Suhm and
Jelks 1962; Arnold 1973). In addition, as many sherds as possible have
been sorted into vessel batches which are individually described in Table
14. The major lithic artifact classes recognized are ornament, tool,
debitage, and unmodified stone. The identification of raw materials follows the scheme employed by Shafer (1973) in his study of the 1939-41 and
1968-70 lithic collections.

~-

Artifact proveniences by excavation unit are presented in Tables
4 through 13, with Tables 11-13 focusing on the contents of Feature 193-1.
Recorded artifact proveniences are either the fill of an individual
feature or an excavation unit in general. Specimens in the latter provenience were recovered from a 1/4-inch mesh screen, were found while
shovelling or trowelling each unit, or are from the fill of non-cultural
disturbances, mostly root molds and rodent burrows.
Burned Clay
Numerous fragments (weighing a total of 3,513 grams) were recovered from Features 191-9 (Unit 60), 193-1 and 193-3 (Unit 62), and the
plowzone of Unit 62. The fragments range from 0.5 cm to 10.0 cm in diameter. Tempering agents are not present. The specimens are identified as
burned because of the oxidized color of their surf aces when compared to
the pedologic B-horizon and their brittleness when dry. Some specimens
may not have been fired, but were preserved because of favorable conditions in the fill of Fl93-l. Squeezed clay lumps reported in Newell and
Krieger (1949: 148) are not present; instead, the 1978 TARL excavation fragments appear to represent the remnants of hearths or other burned surfaces.
Similar fragments of burned clay were also recognized in the 1977 excavations to the east of Mounds B and C, but were not collected or reported due
to the lack of cultural contexts (Ross Fields: personal communication).
Tables 8, 9, and 13 tally the 1978 TARL recovery of burned clay by weight
in grams, rather than number of specimens.
Impressed Clay
Among the fragments described above, 8 retain impressions of plants,
possible fingerprints, and basketry. All were found in Fl93-l, which contained the bulk of the burned clay recovered.

27
Plant Impressions

Five fragments were recovered from Zones 4A, 4B, and 10 in
Fl93-l. The impressions are linear, and are approximately 1.0 to 2.0
cm wide.

One fragment of clay from Zone 5 in Fl93-l has faint, linear
striations that resemble part of a fingerprint. The impressed area is
quite small, however, and a print is merely a suggested possibility.
Since no tempering agent is present, this section of clay is probably not
part of an applique strip from a ceramic vessel.
Basket Impressions

Two basket-impressed fragments were recovered from Fl93-l, zone
uncertain. Only one side of each fragment has an impression. The specimens are 0.9 x 1.2 cm and 1.3 x 1.8 cm in size. The clay may have been
impressed by the baskets used to carry the fill to Fl93-l.
Casts made with modelling clay allowed easier identification of
the techniques of basketry manufacture employed. Following Adovasio's
(1978) classification, either twined or coiled basketry is represented.
If twining is present then each fragment shows 2 warps (stationary, vertical elements) and 3 rows of wefts (active, horizontal elements) . The
wefts are adjacent to each other, covering the warps completely, and
represent a tight weave. Since the warps are not visible, it can only be
stated that they are 0.4 cm wide in both cases. All previous recoveries
of basket impressions at the Davis Site were in Mound C burials (Story
1972).
Non-Vessel Ceramics
Clay Earspools
Portions of 4 earspools were found in the fill of Fl93-l. Each is
described below. The attributes used to describe these specimens are the
same as those employed by Fritz (1975: 37-48). However, some of the terminology she used was confusing to us and is changed in this report. Dimensions measured are: diameter of the inner flange or the smaller of the
two faces (same as in Fritz), diameter of the outer flange (same as in
Fritz), core thickness (Fritz: core wall thickness), width (Fritz: thickness), heights of the inner and outer faces (Fritz: width of the inner and
outer faces), temper and surface treatments (same as in Fritz).

28
The first earspool was recovered from Fl93-l, Zones 5 and undetermined zones, and is in 3 fragments, all of which fit together (Fig.
14-F). Diameter of the inner flange is 3.8 cm; core thickness is 0.4 cm;
width is 2.1 cm; height of inner face is 0.4 cm; outer face is 0.5 cm;
temper is grog. The surface is smoothed on the interior and rough on the
exterior.
The second earspool was recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 5, and is in
4 pieces, 3 of which fit together (Fig. 14-I). The diameter of the inner
flange is 4.5 cm; outer flange is 4.5 cm; core thickness is 0.3 cm; width
is 1.6 cm; height of inner face is 0.4 cm; outer face is also 0.4 cm;
temper is grog. Both the interior and exterior surfaces are polished.
The third earspool is represented by only one fragment, which was
recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 4A. The diameter of the flange present is
4.0 cm; core thickness is 0.5 cm; width is at least 1.5 cm; height of remaining face is 0.7 cm; temper is grog. The surface is smoothed on the
interior and lightly polished on the exterior.
The final earspool is also represented by only one fragment, and
is from Zone 10 of Fl93-l. The diameter of the inner flange is less than
4.0 cm; outer flange is greater than 4.0 cm; core thickness is 0.2 cm;
width is 1.6 cm; height of inner face is 0.5 cm; outer face height is
0.5 cm; temper is grog. The interior surface is smoothed, and the exterior surface is poorly smoothed.
Clay earspools have been recovered from all Davis Site contexts
except Mound C burials (Fritz 1975: 97-99). By contrast, stone earspools
have been found mostly in Mound C or Mound A (Shafer 1973: 333-334), and
are likely to have been restricted to high status individuals.
Pipe Stems
Clay pipe fragments were also found in Fl93-l only, with sections
of 4 pipe stems represented. Typologically, the stems resemble what
Michael Hoffman (1967) designated as Red River pipes. This type has been
previously identified at the Davis Site (Fritz 1975: 90-97; Fields 1978:
15), and specimens have been described as generally fitting into the
Miller's Crossing variety. This variety has been listed as a characteristic of early Caddoan occupations (Fritz 1975: 90-97), but its exact
chronological significance is uncertain (Ibid.: 33).
The first stem fragment was found in rodent disturbed fill of
Fl93-l (Fig 14-G). The length is 2.5 cm and the juncture with the bowl
remains. The inner diameter is 0.3 cm; outer diameter is 0.9 cm; wall
thickness is 0.3 cm; temper is grog. The exterior surface is smoothed.
The second stem is also from Fl93-l, undetermined zones. The
length is 2.0 cm; inner diameter is 0.3 cm; outer diameter is 0.9 cm;
wall thickness is 0.3 cm; temper is bone and grog. The exterior surface
is smoothed.

29
The third stem was recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 4A. The length is
0.8 cm; inner diameter is 0.4 cm; outer diameter is 0.8 cm; wall thickness
is 0.2 cm; temper is grog. The exterior surface is smoothed.
The last stem was found in Fl93-l, Zone 9. The length is 1.5 cm;
inner diameter is 0.5 cm; outer diameter is 0.9 cm; wall thickness is 0.2
cm; temper is bone or kaolin. The exterior surface is smoothed. A
carbon residue is visible pn the interior surface, and the temper is unusual because of the presence of large amounts of bone or possibly kaolin.
Since the stems are so fragmentary, they are difficult to place
into Hoffman's Red River pipe varieties. Their outer diameters are at the
upper end of the Miller's Crossing maximum of 0.85 cm. In addition, the
presence of bone or kaolin in the temper is not typical of the early
varieties in the Red River area. According to Fritz (1975: 32-33) 25% of
the pipes found at Davis prior to 1977 were found in the outer village,
and the other 75% in inner village contexts. The poor sampling in the
outer village, however, may be inflating the inner village percentages
(Ibid.: 106).
Coils
Three clay fragments recovered from Fl93-l probably represent
coil sections left over from the manufacture of ceramic vessels. Similar
fragments have been dealt with in previous reports on the site. Most
recently, Fritz examined eight specimens described by Krieger (Newell
and Krieger 1949: 150) as figurine appendages, and concluded that they
were coil ends (Fritz 1975: 61). Since those collected in 1978 have the
uneven surfaces and/or pinched ends described by Fritz, they too are
interpreted as coil fragments.
The first coil section was recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 12 or 14
(in a deposit not clearly assignable to either of these zones) (Fig.
14-E). The length is 2.7 cm; the diameter is 1.0 to 1.5 cm; temper is
grog. The section is a slightly rolled, rough length of clay, partly
folded on one end. A fingerprint may be visible on one end.
The second section was also recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 12 or
14. The length is 3.0 cm; the diameter is 0.4 to 0.6 cm; temper is bone
and grog. The column of clay is slightly thinner at one end.
The third section was found in Fl93-l, Zone 4A. The length is
1.5 cm; diameter is 0.7 cm; the temper is grog. This piece is more
cylindrical in form ~nd more even in diameter than the other 2 coils.

Vessel Ceramics
A total of 2,233 sherds, representing 166 vessels, was recovered
from 1/4-inch screening, shovelling and trowelling of unit floors, and
excavation of features. Tables 4 and 5 list all sherds found in the 1978
TARL excavations, excluding the small fragments remaining in unstudied
1/16-inch screen samples. The frequencies provided represent counts of
individual sherds as collected. For example, 3 sherds fitted together
were tallied as 3, not 1. Such a system of counting is consistent with
previous ceramic analyses. Feature 193-1 contained 101 matches, the majority of which were sherds from different zones. Table 11 presents the
distribution of sherds within the feature. Table 14 provides individual
vessel descriptions. A vessel count (N=l66) is believed to be a more accurate presentation of the percentages of types present than a sherd count
(Newell and Krieger 1949: 76). Vessels have been numbered successively
within each major heading in Table 14.
The typological categories used to classify the collection are
based on Krieger's original analysis of the Davis ceramics (Ibid.: 81-129),
and on data presented in Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Arnold (1973). Since
the ceramics from throughout the site are remarkably uniform, the existing
typology accommodates the 1978 collection, except where sherds are very
small, badly eroded, or are non-diagnostic body fragments. Each heading
below has listings of sherds, vessels, and percentages of vessels present
in the excavations at the visitor center and the residence fields. Densities of artifacts are quite varied between the visitor and the residence
areas, and may reflect differences in intensity of village activity.
The vessel table (Table 14) describes certain attributes of each
vessel in a standard format. This data is provided to allow study of the
variations within each ceramic category. The count is based on rim sherds
of bowls and jars and body sherds from bottles. This shift from rim to
body in the case of bottles is made because Holly Fine Engraved and Hickory
Fine Engraved bottle rims are indistinguishable, while body motifs are
separable. Bottle forms do not occur within any of the other types.
The attributes recorded for each vessel are temper, form, oral
diameter (where determinable), surface treatment, and edge condition. Edge
condition was included in the hope that it would permit a comparative statement on the post-breakage history of individual vessels. The description
of each vessel follows a standardized sequence and terminology. The number of sherds present and the number that match together into sections is
listed first, followed by provenience. Lip and rim forms are based on the
categories defined by Brown (1971: Fig. 2) in his analysis of the Spiro
Site pottery. Lips are classified as either flat or rounded, based on the
plane formed between the upper ends of the inner and outer surfaces. Flat
lips are a straight plane, rounded are convex. Rim morphology is classified as direct, thinned, or expanding, based on the thickness of the rim
from its lower extremity up to the lip. Direct signifies no variation in
thickness, thinned a decrease towards the lip, and expanding an increase.
Surface treatment of the interior and exterior follows, with smoothed
representing any flattening of irregularities, and polished a further addition of a glossy sheen onto the surface. Edge condition refers to the

31
breaks of the sherds. Worn edges are smoothed doi;.m and rounded off.
Fresh edges show sharp, intact angles, and are easily pieced together
when matches are present. A description of the decorative techniques and
motifs present concludes each vessel discussion.

Typed Sherds
Holly Fine Engraved

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd
Residence Field: 59 sherds (30 vessels, 19:0% of vessels)
Decorations consist of engraved lines around excised areas (Arnold
1973: 33). Two principal decorative motifs are represented. The first is
one of parallel lines arranged in vertical and diagonal groups around excised triangles on the rims of bowls and jars (Fig. 12-A,B,D). Concentric
quarter circles, full circles, and small excised areas form the second
motif and usually occur on bottle bodies. Decorations present but uncommon in the 1978 TARL collection are: an engraved circle flanked by an
excised triangle on the lip (vessel No. 13), two parallel engraved lines
on the lip (vessel No. 2), and horizontal incised lines below the rim
(vessels No. 4, Fig. 12-B, and No. 13). One outflaring bowl rim is unusual
in that it has lines and excised triangles on both the exterior body and
the interior rim (vessel No. 18).
A carinated bowl rim sherd (vessel No. 8, Fig. 12-D,E) has multiple scars superimposed over a typical Holly bowl decoration. Although
gouged areas on the lip may have been made by a rodent, the scratches on
the exterior (N=l7) and interior (N=9) surfaces are probably man-made.
These scratches are unpatterned and end before they reach the edges of the
sherd. Clearly, they were made on the sherd and not the whole vessel.
The reason(s) for the scratches in not known, unless perhaps the sherd was
used as a small, hand-held cutting board.
Red pigment, often rubbed into engraved lines, is preserved in 21
sherds. Surfaces are also usually polished or smoothed, with the exception of bottle interiors.
Recognizable vessel forms are: simple hemispherical bowls (8), carinated bowls (7), a bowl with out-flaring rim, and a bottle. Flat and
rounded lip forms are present, as well as direct, thinned, and expanding
rims. Temper of sherds is grog (48), bone and grog (3), grog and carbonized
matter (5), bone, grog, and carbonized matter (1).
Hickory Fine Engraved

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 7 sherds (6 vessels, 3.8% of vessels)

Horizontal engraved lines on a polished surface make up the only
decorative motif of this type recognized in the present collection (Fig.
12-F). Lines are restricted to the rims of bowls, and to the rims and
shoulder areas of bottles. Only bottle bodies with no decorations other
than horizontal lines are present and recognized by type. Other sherds
that might be Hickory were very similar to Holly sherds in color, polished
surfaces. and width of engraved lines (see below). Temper of the sherds
was grog (7), and red pigment remained in the decorations of one. Exterior surfaces are polished or smoothed.
Holly or Hickory Fine Engraved

Visitor Center Field: l sherd
Residence Field: 24 sherds (6 vessels, 3.8% of vessels)
The rim and body sherds in this group show only horizontal engraved lines and hence could be either Holly or Hickory. Only bottle
bodies are counted as vessels. Temper of the sherds is grog (23) and bone
and grog (2). Red pigment occurs in the lines of 2 sherds.
Davis Incised

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 14 sherds (6 vessels, 3.8% of vessels)
The decorative attributes of this type are parallel, incised lines
running horizontally about the vessel rim, and a plain body. Thus only
those sherds retaining a portion of the plain body are so typed.
Recognized vessel forms are: simple hemispherical bowls (4), a
carinated bowl, and an incurved bowl. Oral diameters range from 24 to
44 cm, and seem large when compared to other types (Table 14). All 14
sherds are grog tempered.
Kiam Incised

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 25 sherds (6 vessels, 3.8% of vessels)
What is here identified as Kiam was included in Dunkin Incised in
Krieger's analysis of the Davis Site ceramics (Newell and Krieger 1949).
Only later was it defined as a separate type (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Diagnostics of this type are parallel incised lines encircling the rim combined
with body decorations, usually vertical incised lines, punctates or pinches
(Arnold 1973: 37) (Fig. 12-C).
Determinable vessel forms are simple hemispherical bowls (3) and
jars (2). Interior surfaces are smoothed or polished, but exterior surfaces are sometimes left rough after decorations have been applied. Temper
of all 25 sherds is grog.

33
Crockett Curvilinear Incised

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd
Residence Field: 33 sherds (11 vessels, 7.0% of vessels)
Decorations consist of punctated or hatchured areas bound by incised lines, arranged into curvilinear or circular motifs (Fig. 13-A,B,D,E).
Finely ground mussel shell in a kaolin(?)-based medium was found
in the incised lines and punctates of 2 vessels (Nos. 1 and 6, Fig. 13-A,D,
E). To our knowledge, this type of pigment has not been previously reported in the Caddoan area. No doubt the neutral pH of the fill in Fl93-l
is responsible for the shell being preserved.
Vessel forms identifiable are hemispherical bowls (5), a carinated
bowl, a flaring rim bowl, and jars (2). Temper in all 34 sherds is grog.
Pennington Punctated-Incised

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 21 sherds (2 vessels, 1.3% of vessels)
Punctations zoned by incised lines, organized into straight line
motifs are diagnostic of this type. Both of the vessels present are
hemispherical bowls and come from Fl93-l. One of these had a single line
incised into the lip. All 21 sherds are grog tempered.
Crockett Curvilinear Incised or Pennington Punctated-Incised

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 7 sherds (3 vessels, 1.9% of vessels)
Sherds which have zoned punctations but which are not large enough
to permit identification of the motif represented are included here. The
one determinable vessel form is a simple hemispherical bowl. Temper for
all 7 sherds is grog.

diagonal incised lines in bands, separated by triplets of vertical lines
(1) (Fig. 13-F), cross-hatching (1) (Fig. 13-C), and random pinches (1).
Vessel forms can be identified as simple hemispherical bowls (7),
jars (7), cylindrical vessels (3), and flaring rim bowls (3). Interior
and exterior surfaces are smoothed and polished, except occasional (9)
cases where decorations are not smoothed over. Temper of 1 sherd is grog
and carbonized matter; the other 89 contain grog only.
Duren Neck Banded

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 1 sherd (1 vessel, 0.6% of.vessels)
'!'his one rim sherd was recovered from the plowzone of Unit 62.
Decoration consists of crimping coils down over preceding ones, leaving
a corrugated surface about the rim. Body treatments are reported to vary
from plain to punctates and pinches (Newell and Krieger 1949: 122).
Form of the one vessel represented is unknown; the temper is
grog.
Bowles Creek Plain

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd (1 vessel, 12.5% of vessels)
Residence Field: 31 sherds (8 vessels, 5.0% of vessels)
Only plain rim sherds large enough to show that they are not broken
sections between decorative motifs are counted as Bowles.
Vessel forms identified are hemispherical bowls (4), carinated
bowls (2), a shallow plate, and a globular jar (Fig. 13-H). The one almost complete vessel, the jar, has been restored from sherds collected
from nearly every zone within the fill of Fl93-l (Table 14). Interior
and exterior surfaces are smoothed or polished on every vessel. Bone
and grog temper is found in 3 sherds, and the other 29 contain grog.

Untyped Rim Sherds
Horizontal Incising, Group A

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 52 sherds (28 vessels, 17.7% of vessels)
A large group of rim sherds have horizontal incised lines.
Group A represents those sherds with the lip present, Group B sherds lack
lip. Body areas are not present. and hence classification into type is
not possible. Davis, Kiam, Pennington and Crockett have incised horizontal

35

lines about the rim, although multiple lines are more typical of Davis
and Kiam. Thus most of the sherds listed are probably from Davis and
Kiam vessels.
Forms of the vessels recognized are hemispherical bowls (11), a
flaring rim bowl, and jars (2). Some of the exterior surfaces were left
rough after the decorations had been applied, and the others are polished
or smoothed. Grog temper is present in 50 sherds, the other 2 contain
bone and grog.

Horizontal Incising, Group B

Visitor Center Field: 3 sherds (2 vessels, 25% of vessels)
Residence Field: 17 sherds (15 vessels, 9.5% of vessels)
These sherds can be identified as rims but do not have intact
The types probably represented are Davis, Kiam and, less likely,
Crockett and Pennington.
lips.

Only hemispherical bowls (4) and jars (2) can be recognized. Surface treatments also vary between smoothing and polishing. Temper of t he
sherds collected is grog (17) or bone and grog (3).
Unusual Motifs

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd (1 vessel, 12.5% of vessels)
Residence Field: 7 sherds (7 vessels, 4.4% of vessels)
These rims have incised lines forming motifs that cannot be linked
with any of the above types. Decorations are: widely spaced diagonal
lines, slanting to the right (vessel No. l); nested incised squares or
rectangles (vessel No. 2); lip incised with a single line, otherwise plain
(vessel No. 3); narrow diagonal bands of incised lines filled with hatchures
and separated from one another by undecorated zones (vessel No. 4); widely
spaced diagonal lines, slanting to the right (vessel No. 5); a herringbone
motif of alternating incised lines separated by a vertical line (vessel
No. 6); parallel vertical incised lines on the exterior rim, and an overhanging interior rim with inverted pinnate triangles filled with punctations (vessel No. 7).
Vessel forms recognized are carinated bowls (2), a hemispherical
bowl, and a jar. Temper in the group is very similar to the previous
types, with grog (5) and bone and grog (3) present.
Brushed

Visitor Center Field: 2 sherds (1 vessel, 12.5% of vessels)
Residence Field: none

36
Two rim fragments possibly from the same vessel were found in the
plowzone of Unit 59. Identification of the decoration as brushing is
tentative because the fragments are small and it is difficult to distinguish between closely spaced incised lines and brushing. If these sherds
are indeed brushed, they may be from an occupation at the Davis Site later
than the one represented by the previous ceramics (Newell and Krieger 1949:
191-192). Brushed sherds are uncommon at the site, and are the only possible evidence of a later occupation found in the 1978 TARL excavations.

Untyped Body Sherds
Engraved

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd
Residence Field: 21 sherds
Such a small portion of an engraved decoration is present on these
sherds that they cannot be confidently placed in the category Holly/
Hickory, described earlier.
Vertical Incising

Visitor Center Field: 3 sherds
Residence Field: 85 sherds
Most of these sherds are probably from the bodies of jars, particularly from Kiam or Weches vessels.
Cross-Hatch Incising

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 5 sherds
Cross-hatching on vessel bodies is uncommon at the Davis Site and
it is possible - but we think it unlikely - that these are rim rather than
body sherds. Krieger (Newell and Krieger 1949: Fig. 44,F) does illustrate
one such body decoration which he tentatively identified as a variant of
Dunkin; moreover, Weches vessel 3 (Table 14), found in the 1978 TARL
excavations, had cross-hatching on the body.
Incised Chevron

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 1 sherd

37
No lip is present on this sherd and it cannot be confidently identified as a rim, therefore it is listed here. Similar sherds were classified
by Krieger (Newell and Krieger 1949: 133-135) as the Lower Mississippi
Valley type .'.fa:rksville Incised.
Motif Uncertain, Incised

Visitor Center Field: 13 sherds
Residence Field: 82 sherds
While these sherds are clearly from vessels having incised lines,
they are too small to permit recognition of the motif represented. Although none has a lip, it is possible that some are in fact rims.

Grooved

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 5 sherds
These sherds are distinguished by one, and in a single case two,
very broad (ca. 4 mm) apparently straight lines that appear to have been
formed while the vessel surface was still plastic. One line might be
classed as trailed, but as a group they most closely resemble what Krieger
(Newell and Krieger 1949: Fig. 48,A-E) called grooved decoration. All are
quite small, and hence only tentatively identified as body sherds.
Pinched-Whorl Motif

Visitor Center Field: 1 sherd
Residence Field: 21 sherds
A whorl pattern formed by an incised line flanked by small pinches
is the decoration on these body sherds. This pattern has been previously
reported on a Weches vessel (Ibid. Fig. 46,F).
Pinched-Motif Uncertain

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 9 sherds
These are pinched body sherds which were too small to permit
identification of the decorative motif represented.
Fingernail Impressed

Visitor Center Field: 8 sherds
Residence Field: 167 sherds

38
of these body sherds have small, closely spaced horizontal or
diagonal rows of impressions. Vessel types that might have such body
decorations are Weches, Kiam, Duren and Dunkin. Fingernail impressed body
sherds presumed to come from the bodies of jars and cylindrical vessels
were recovered by the thousands by Newell (Newell and Krieger 1949: 128).

Visitor Center Field: 48 sherds
Residence Field: 646 sherds
This category is comprised of sherds large enough to be identified
as coming from vessels having plain bodies. Aplastics added to the paste
are well within the range of the typed sherds (Table 10) and are, in decreasing frequency: grog, bone and grog, grog and carbonized matter, and
bone, grog and carbonized matter.

Plain-Sandy Paste

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 1 sherd
This sherd is singled out as a separate category solely on the
basis of its sandy paste. Similar pottery has been previously reported
at Davis (Newell and Krieger 1949: 130-133; Fields 1978: 16) and is now
generally accepted as representing a pre-Caddoan component (Shafer 1973:
29).
Too Small or Surface Damaged
Visitor Center Field: 51 sherds
Residence Field: 652 sherds
This group is comprised of sherds that could not be placed in any
of the above categories because they are either too small or have severely
damaged surfaces. Although they have not been further classified by temper (Table 10), none has a sandy paste.

39
Summary of Vessel Ceramics
The 1978 TA.."tli. collection is a small (2,233 sherds) but apparently
typical sample of Davis Site ceramics. With the exception of Dunkin
Incised, all major types previously identified at the site are present.
All of the pottery was evidently manufactured locally during the major
Caddoan occupation, with the exception of the possible Marksville and
brushed sherds, and more obviously, the sandy paste sherd.
A total of 340 sherds (15.2% of the sherds) can be grouped into
166 vessel batches. Hopefully, the vessel count shows frequencies of
types more accurately than a sherd count. Holly Fine Engraved (18.1%)
and Weches Fingernail Impressed (19.3%) stanq out as the most common types
in the 1978 TARL vessels, and Horizontal Incised Groups A and B (27.1%)
probably contain many Kiam Incised (3.6%) and Davis Incised (3.6%) vessels.
Although the typology used here differs slightly from that employed by
Krieger, the percentages are comparable to those from the WPA excavations.
In that collection, Holly made up 23.8% of the vessels, Dunkin (many of
which would now be classified as Kiam) 26.1% and Davis 5.7%. Weches
vessels (9.0% of the WPA collection) were less common around Mound A
(Newell and Krieger 1949: Table 13), and Arnold (1973: 179) indicates that
Weches vessels may be more common in the outer village.
Individual vessel attributes reflect the general homogeneity of
the ceramics at the site noted by Arnold (1973: 178). Forms are similar
to those previously described for the types (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Carinated, simple, and hemispherical bowls dominated the types Holly,
Crockett, Weches, Bowles Creek. Bottles are connnon in Holly and Hickory,
and jars frequently occur in Kiam, Crockett, Weches, and Bowles Creek.
Oral diameters could be determined for only 36% of the vessels, but these
seem consistent with the type descriptions in all cases. Bottles are
usually 10 cm or less in diameter; bowls and jars range from 10 to 30 cm.
Davis Incised bowls stand out in this collection with oral diameters from
20 to 45 cm. In general, lip and rim forms of the 1978 TARL vessels are
not particularly varied or complex. Flat lips make up 69% of those present,
and are most connnon on all types except Bowles Creek. Rounded lips account
for the remaining 31%. Direct rims are on 54% of the vessels, 41% are
thinned, and only 5% are expanding. Exterior surfaces are polished on 55%
of the vessels, with Holly (26 of 29 vessels), Hickory (5 of 6) and Bowles
.Creek (8 of 9) most prominent. Smoothing was present on 29% of the exterior surfaces, and 16% have decorations left rough. Interior surfaces
are also treated: 49% are polished, 40% are smoothed, and 11% (mostly
bottle bodies) are rough. Overall, the most care seems to have been taken
in the manufacture of Holly vessels (polishing, etc.) and the least on
Weches vessels (11 polished, 11 smoothed, and 9 left rough).
In spite of the relatively small sample size, some previously unreported decorations were encountered. A Holly outflaring bowl has engraving on both surfaces (vessel No. 18); 2 Holly vessels have horizontal
incised lines below the rims (vessels No. 4, Fig. 12-B, and No. 13); a
Weches vessels has cross-hatching on the body (vessel No. 3. Fig. 13-C);
finely ground shell is present in the decorations of 2 Crockett vessels
(Nos. 1, 6, Fig. 13-A,D,E).

40
Temper of the sherds was found to be as expected from previous
work at the Davis Site. Grog was overwhelmingly preferred (90.6%),
while bone and grog were quite infrequent (6.5%). Carbonized matter
may represent accidental inclusions to grog, and is of minor importance
(2.5%). Bone, grog, and carbonized matter are present in 4 sherds (0.3%)
and 1 sherd has a sandy paste (0.1%).
The sandy paste sherd was recovered from the residence field
plowzone, as was one dart point preform, and may indicate a relationship
to a possible concentration of early artifacts in the northern part of
the site (Creel 1978: 12).

Sherd densities indicate differences in intensity of activity between the 2 septic field excavations. The visitor center field plowzone
(50% screening sample, exclusive of features, etc.) contained 137 sherds.
Projecting a 100% screen recovery, the 274 sherds in 54.12 m3 fill equals
5.06 sherds per cubic meter. Other units were excavated near the proposed
septic fields in 1977 and small percentages of the plowzones were screened
(Fields 1978: 4-5, Fig. 2, Table 5). Projecting a 100% sample for these
units (assuming an average depth of 27 cm for 6 x 8 meter units) shows
that densities for nearby Units 19, 20, and 27 are similar at 2 to 12
sherds per m3 •
A 100% screen sample in the residence field would equal 1,350 sherds
in 49.58 m3 of plowzone or 27.23 sherds/m 3 • This is much higher than in the
visitor center field or the nearby Units 18, 26, 29 (Fields 1978: Fig. 2,
Table 5) which range from 8 to 17 sherds/m 3 • Units near Mound Care similar
to the residence field, with Units 32, 34, and 35 (Ibid.) having projected
densities of 13 to 37 sherds/m 3 • In addition, excavations just across
Weeping Mary road (Creel 1978) also have higher densities (exact sherd data
not yet available). The residence field units may therefore be part of an
area of higher occupational activity on the northern end of the Davis Site.
In contrast, the visitor center units may be in an area to the east of
Mounds B and C where Caddoan activity was less intense.
The trash filled pit, Fl93-l, contained the largest single accumulation of ceramics, with 1,377 sherds representing 134 vessels (65.7% of
the sherds and 84.8% of the vessels in the residence field). Within this
sample 101 sherd matches were made. These matches provide interesting
comparisons of sherd histories, when color and preservation conditions
vary. Crockett vessel No. 1 (Fig. 13-A) has one sherd with shell in the
decorations and another without. Weches vessel No. 3 (Fig. 13-C) and
Crockett vessel No. 4 (Fig. 13-D) have matched sherds of different colors,
and are examples of breaks that must have occurred sometime before the
pieces were discarded into the pit. In addition, 57 other Fl93-l vessels
had fresh breaks on the component sherds, possibly representing ceramics
that had been used and broken shortly before the pit was filled.

Lithics
A total of 903 lithic objects were recovered from the five 1978
TARL units, with chipped stone debitage making up 90.6% (819 specimens)
of the collection. As with the ceramics, the lithics came from the plowzone, excavation unit floors, and the fill of cultural features. The
major classification categories are ornament, tools, debitage, and unmodified stones. The tools are further divided into abraded, pitted.
polished, and chipped stone.
Ornament
Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 1

none

A small fragment of a pulley-shaped earspool was recovered from
Unit 62, Fl93-l, Zone 5. It is an outer flange section (2.8 x 1.2 x 0.5
cm) of siltstone, and is estimated to have initially been 6 cm in diameter.
The exterior surface is well-smoothed and undecorated.
The presence of a stone earspool so removed from the mounds was
unexpected, as all previously recovered specimens were from Mound C
burials (N=14) and Inner Village A (N=l3) (Shafer 1973: 333-334; Fields
1978: 24). In spite of this 1978 find, stone earspools continue to be
one of the better markers of elite social status (Fritz 1975: 84).

Tools
Abraded, Pitted, and Polished

These specimens are made from local f erruginous sandstone,
limonite, and hematite, as well as non-local Catahoula sandstone (Shafer
1973: 313-317). The sub-classes recognized follow the scheme used by
Shafer in his analysis of stone tools shaped through use (Ibid.: 311-332).
Abraded Stones

Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 23

2

Each of these stones has at least one flat surface shaped through
abrasion. Xost (N=l4) are tabular with parallel sides and were probably
used because of naturally flat, easy to modify surfaces. Rounded and irregularly shaped stones (N=7) also had abraded surfaces. In addition,
grooved tabular stones (N=4) were recovered. These grooves are linear,
shallow, U-shaped, and approximately 0.4 cm wide. Finally, one specimen
is a small, thin fragment (0.4 x 1.4 x 1.8 cm) that has two intact edges

42

forming a right angle. It is included in this category because of its
tabular shape, but it is too fragmentary to identify, and similar objects
have not been found in previous excavations at the Davis Site.
Source materials of the specimens are ferruginous sandstone (N=lS),
hematite (N=6), Catahoula sandstone (N=S), and fine-grained sandstone
(N=l). Sizes of all but the one thin, fine-grained sandstone object range
from 1 x 2 x 3 cm to 4 x 6 x 13 cm.
----- ------------------- Shafer (1973: 312) mentions that abraded tools are often referred
to as hones and may exhibit attributes of grooves, surface faceting, and
edge faceting on the same specimen. Functions of such objects are not
known, but most probably relate to tool manufacture·
Pitted Stones

Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 3

none

Ferruginous sandstone (N=2) and limonite (N=l) are the source
stones for these sub-rectangular specimens. Two specimens have one oval
depression each, a third has depressions on both sides. These depressions are roughly 3 cm in diameter, and have shallow, roughened bottoms.
No other modifications are present on the tools. Overall dimensions are
approximately 4 x 8 x 10 cm.

Polished Stones

Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 1

1

These two rounded pebbles are of a fine-textured hematite that is
harder and more compact than the hematite selected for abraded stones.
Both of these objects are 2 x 2 x 4 cm in size and are lightly polished.
Shafer (1973: 320) describes previously discovered polished tools as locally obtained stream-worn stones, possibly used as pot polishers.

Chipped Stone

The chipped stone artifacts are divided into finished tools
(dart point, arrow point, biface, and uni.face) and preforms (dart and
arrow). Source materials are chert, quartzite, silicified wood, siltstone,
sandstone, and other materials which we could not identify. The varieties
of crystalline silicates were referred to as flint by Shafer (1973), but
are listed here as chert. Local and non-local materials were not differentiated in the 1978 TARL collection. Quartzite, silicified wood,
siltstone, and sandstone have been classified in accordance with Shafer's
categories.

43
Finished Tools

Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 16

Dart Point

The one dart point was recovered from the plowzone of Unit 61. It
is a contracting stem fragment with a concave base. Dimensions are 1 x
1.5 cm and thickness is 0.6 cm.
Most, if not all, dart points previously found at the Davis Site
are of pre-Caddoan manufacture, either re-used by the Caddoans, or left
as remnants of earlier occupations (Shafer 1Q73: 181~187). The reduction
process of most dart points was that of cores being shaped into tools.
This is in contrast to the dominant Caddoan process of producing arrow
points from flakes (Ibid.: 76-77). ·
Arrow Point

Ten small points were recovered, five of which are relatively complete. Individual listings below are grouped by type, where identified.
Four arrow points of the type Alba and 1 of the type Hayes were identified.
The remaining five are too fragmentary to type. The typological categories
follow those outlined by Shafer (1973: 191, 214) and Suhm and Jelks (1962:
263, 277).
Type Alba
A chert base identifiable as this type was recovered from the
plowzone of Unit 59. The stem has parallel edges and a slightly convex
base. Part of the blade remains, and is triangular with barbed shoulders
and non-serrated edges. The blade width at the shoulders is 1.7 cm;
stem length is 0.7 cm; and maximum thickness is 0.3 cm.

The second Alba fragment (Fig. 14-D) was found in Fl93-l, Zone lB.
It is also made of chert, and has a slightly expanding stem. The base is
slightly convex. The broken blade is triangular, and the one remaining
shoulder is barbed and outflaring. The width at the shoulders was originally about 1.7 cm; stem length is 0.9 cm; and maximum thickness is 0.3
cm.

A nearly complete Alba point (Fig. 14-B) was recovered from
Fl93-l, Zone 10. It is also made of chert, and has a stem with parallel
edges and a slightly convex base. The blade is triangular with concave to
slightly recurved edges and somewhat outflaring, barbed shoulders. The
blade edges are f:inely serrated. Overall length is approximately 3.1 cm
(tip is missing); width at the shoulders is approximately 1.8 cm (one barb
is partially broken); the stem is 0.8 cm long; and the maximum thickness
is 0.3 cm.

44
The fourth Alba point - the only one made of silicified wood - was
found in Fl93-l, Zone 5. One of the barbs is missing. The stem has
parallel edges and a convex base. The blade is triangular with slightly
convex, serrated edges and barbed shoulders. Overall length is 2.6 cm;
width at the shoulders was approximately 1.5 cm; stem length is 0.6 cm;
and the maximum thickness is 0.3 cm.
Type Hayes

The one Hayes point recovered (Fig. 14-C) was found in Unit 62,
Fl93-3, and is made of chert. The stem is diamond-shaped and the blade
is slender and triangular. The blade edges are slightly recurved with
out-flaring, barbed shoulders, and are finely- serrated. Overall length
is 3.8 cm; width at the shoulders is 1.7 cm; stem length is 0.7 cm;
maximum thi~kness is 0.3 cm.

The stem and one shoulder of a second untyped point are missing.
It was recovered from the plowzone of Unit 62. The edges are slightly
recurved and the intact barb projects laterally. The overall length was
approximately 2.5 cm; the width at the shoulders was approximately 1.2 cm;
and the maximum thickness is 0.3 cm.
A third arrow point blade fragment was found in Fl93-l, undetermined zones. The tip and stem are missing. The blade is triangular with
finely serrated edges. It is made of chert. It is 0.8 cm long; maximum
width is 0.7 cm; and the maximum thickness is 0.2 cm.
A fourth blade fragment was found in the plowzone of Unit 63, and
both the tip and stem are again absent. The source material is chert.
Length of the fragment is 2.0 cm; maximum width is 1.3 cm; and the maximum thickness is 0.4 cm.
A fifth arrow point fragment unidentifiable as to type was also
found in the plowzone of Unit 63. The blade is intact to the shoulders~
but most of the stem is missing. The blade edges are straight to slightly
concave, and the shoulders are barbed. The blade edges are finely serrated. Blade length is 1.7 cm; width at the shoulders is 1.2 cm; maximum
thickness is 0.3 cm.
Bifaces

Five artifacts recovered in the 1978 TARL excavations are tools
that fall into Shafer's Other Bifaces category (Shafer 1973: 223-253).

45
The specimens can be further divided into 2 subgroups. The first represents well-made tools from which all cortex has been removed, and on which
all edges are shaped (Shafer 1973: 224-229), Flint Group 1). The second
consists of crude bifaces on which some cortex remains, and with only
some edges thinned (Ibid.: 231-254).
Well-Hade Bifaces

The two artifacts falling within this category are edge fragments,
but their thicknesses and quality of workmanship indicate that they are
not dart or arrow points, and the latter attribute would exclude them
from the category Crude Bifaces.
The first specimen was found in the plowzone of Unit 62, and can
be clearly identified as part of a Gahagan biface. The fragment is 1.8 x
1.6 cm in s~ze and ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in thickness. Thinning scars
are evident on both faces, and part of one edge is present. Shafer reports that Gahagan bifaces were made from non-local, fine-textured. gray
flints (Shafer 1973: 224-231). Sixty-four identifiable specimens have
been found in previous excavations (Ibid.: 224) predominantly in Mound C
burials (N=35 of 64) and in the vicinity of Mound A (N=22 of 64). Both
complete and fragmentary specimens were found in the burials, indicating
a very high value was placed on these artifacts, even when broken. No
Gahagan bifaces have been found in excavation units east or north of
Mounds B and C prior to the fall of 1978 (Shafer 1973, Fields 1978, Creel
1978).
The second well-made biface fragment was found in Fl93-l, Zone 2.
It is made from a gray chert, but is too small to identify as a Gahagan
biface fragment. The dimensions of the specimen are 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm.
Thin~ing scars are quite evident on the specimen, and one small section
of an edge remains.
Crude Bifaces

Two nodules of silicified wood and 1 of chert are modified on the
edges only.
The first is a roughly elliptical piece of silicified wood which
was recovered from the plowzone of Unit 62. Thinning was limited to the
edges, and cortex remains on both sides of the artifact. Its maximum
dimensions are 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.6 cm. The edges have been modified around
all but 0.8 cm of the perimeter of the specimen. The tool resembles those
described by Shafer in silicified wood biface Groups 3 and 4 (Shafer 1973:
250, Fig. 21,R-S), which possibly represent older artifacts recycled by
the Caddoan occupants (Ibid.: 262).
The second artifact is a sub-rectangular chert biface recovered
from the plowzone of Unit 62. Two deep, heat-produced fractures are
present on the edges. One of the four edges was not thinned. Maximum
length is 3.2 cm; maximum width is 3.1 cm; maximum thickness is 1.8 cm.

46
A triangular piece of silicif ied wood from the plowzone of Unit 63
is the third crudely made biface. Some bifacial thinning is evident on
one of the edges. Length of the artifact is 2.9 cm; its width ranges from
0.2 cm at the tip to 1.8 cm at the base; maximum thickness is 0.8 cm. This
tool shows edge wear at the tip, and may have been used as a perforator.
Uniface

The two artifacts in this category are also finished tools, and
are therefore distinguished from debitage flakes with edge modification.
The first is a chert specimen, recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 5.
There are four projections about the perimeter of the artifact. Two
adjacent ones appear to have been used as perforators, as edge wear is
present on the tips of both. The other two were probably formed by an
accidental edge fracture. ~ximum dimensions are 2.3 x 2.2 x 0.4 cm.
The utilized projections are triangular and are 0.4 to 0.6 cm long. The
other two projections are rounded and approximately 0.5 cm long. The
specimen most resembles tools that Shafer (1973: 220) termed awls, which
may have been used for piercing small holes in leather or wood.
The second specimen is a large chert uniface recovered from the
plowzone of Unit 63. Its outline is trapezoidal, and its maximum dimensions are 5. 2 x 4. 4 x l. 3 cm. Two edges have been deliberately retouched,
and are worn from use.
Preforms

Visitor Center Field:
Residence Field: 3

none

These artifacts have assumed the general shape and size of finished
projectile points but were not completed. Shafer defined such specimens as
"failures" in his discussion of reduction strategies (Shafer 1973: 73-81).
One dart and two arrow point preforms were recovered in the 1978 TARL excavations.
Dart Point

This triangular blade fragment of chert was recovered from th~
plowzone of Unit 62. One edge is straight, the other slightly convex.
Impurities on one side may have led to rejection. The length is 4.1
cm; width at the shoulders is 2.5 cm; maximum thickness is 1.1 cm. The
character of flake removal is similar to that described by Shafer (1973:
75-76) as pre-Caddoan in technology.
Arrow Point

Fl93-l.

Both of the arrow point preforms were recovered from Zone 5 of
One was almost intact, and was of chert. The stem was not com-

47
pleted, nor were the edges. The blade is triangular, and approximately
3 cm long (the tip is missing); width at the shoulders is 2.2 cm; maximum
thickness is 0.4 cm. Preliminary thinning of the flake had been completed,
but a large hinge fracture on one edge may have led to rejection.
The other arrow point preform is a chert blade fragment. The
bulb of percussion is still present on the distal end; the proximal end
is broken. The maximum length is 1.5 cm; maximum width is 1.3 cm at
the broken end; maximum thickness is 0.4 cm.

Debitage
The chipped stone debitage (819 specimens) has been classified by
material, stage of reduction, and presence or absence of edge modification.
Source materials are chert, quartzite, silicified wood, siltstone, sandstone, and other stones we could not identify. Stages of reduction refer
to cores and whole flakes (N=707), with broken flakes listed separately as
chips (N=ll2), to avoid including fragments in incorrect stage of reduction
categories. Cores are stones from which flakes have been removed intentionally. Primary flakes retain the original outer surface (cortex) over
100% of the exterior surf ace. Secondary flakes show scars of previous
flake removal on the exterior sides, but still retain some cortex.
Tertiary flakes are without any cortex.
Flakes with edge modification (EM) are listed separately (Tables 6
and 7) from those with no edge modification (NEM). Shafer's dissertation
includes 14 categories of edge wear and modification, but only presence or
absence, as listed in Fields' report (Fields 1978: 22), is recorded here.
As Fields states, "the cause of this edge wear or modification may be related to any of the following: 1) intentional removal of flakes 2) flake
removal through use, and 3) fortuitous removal of flakes after discard"
(Ibid.).
Chert

Visitor Center Field: 62 flakes and chips (68.2% of debitage in that field)
Residence Field: 641 cores, flakes and chips (88.3% of debitage in that
field)
The only cores recovered from the 1978 TARL excavations were 7
chert specimens from the residence field. Primary flakes make up 4.8 and
1.4% of the chert from each field, secondary flakes 35.5 and 28.2%,
tertiary flakes 51.6 and 55.6%. Chips make up the remaining 8.1 and
13.7% of the chert debitage in the two septic fields. Edge modifications
are present on 9.4% of the residence field flakes.

48
Quartzite

Visitor Center Field: 18 flakes and ships (19.8% of debitage in that field)
Residence Field: 32 flakes and chips (4.4% of debitage in that field)
Primary flakes were not found in the visitor center field, but they
do make up 6.3% of the residence field quartzite. Secondary flakes make up
11.1 and 28.1% of the two fields, tertiary 66.7 and 50.0%. Chips make up
the remaining 22.2 and 15.6%. Edge modification is not present on any of
the quartzite debitage.
Silicified Wood

Visitor Center Field: 11 flakes and chips (12.0% of debitage in that field)
Residence Field: 40 flakes and chips (6.4% of debitage in that field)
Primary flakes were not found in the visitor center units, but make
up 10% of the residence field silicified wood. Secondary flakes make up
36.4 and 40.0% of the two collections, tertiary flakes 54.5 and 30.0%.
Chips make up 9.1 and 20.0% of the silicified wood debitage. Edge modification is found on only 1 secondary flake from the residence field.
Siltstone

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 10 flakes and chips (1.3% of debitage in that field)
The small residence field collection is made up of 80.0% secondary
flakes, 10.0% tertiary flakes and 10.0% chips. Edge modification is
present on the 1 tertiary flake.
Sandstone

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 1 flake (0.1% of debitage in that field)
The single secondary flake of sandstone does not show edge
modification.
Other Source Materials

Visitor Center Field: none
Residence Field: 4 flakes (0.5% of debitage in that field)
A single secondary flake represents 25% of these unidentified
stones, 3 tertiary flakes make up the other 75%. Edge modification is
not present.

Unmodified Stones
These complete and broken specimens (N=33) are raw materials that
Relatively large stones of this nature do not naturally occur on the Davis Site terrace (Shafer 1973: 52). Therefore, it
is assumed that the aboriginal inhabitants moved the stones to the site.
Some specimens were found in features, and are similar to the materials
used for abraded, pitted, and polished stone tools. Source materials
present are ferruginous sandstone, conglomerate, limonite, Catahoula
sandstone, and other materials we could not identify.

Summary of Lithics
The lithic collection from the 1978 TARL excavations consists of 1
siltstone earspool fragment, 30 abraded, pecked, and polished stones,
1 dart point, 17 arrow points, 1 dart point preform, 2 arrow point preforms,
819 pieces of debitage, and 34 unmodified stones. With the exception of
the dart point and dart preforms, the tools, debitage, and source materials
are typical of the Caddoan occupation of the Davis Site.
Pre-Caddoan occupation of the site is represented by the dart point
fragment from the visitor center field and the dart preform from the
residence field. Concentrations of early artifacts have been noted in
the vicinity of Mound A (Shafer 1973: 186) and on the northern end of the
site (Creel 1978: 12). The residence field dart preform and previously
mentioned sandy-paste sherd may be part of the northern concentration.
The generally light scatter of early artifacts over the rest of the site
may be represented by the fragment from Unit 61. Only 1 other dart point
(Unit 30) had previously been recovered in the area east of Mounds B and
C (Fields 1978: 20). Local source materials were utilized for most of the
Caddoan lithics. Five abraded tools and 3 unmodified pieces of Catahoula
sandstone, and 2 fine grey flint bifaces are the only readily recognizable
artifacts of non-local materials. Some of the chert debitage and the
chert from which the Hayes arrow point was manufactured may also be of
non-local origin, but could not be definitely identified as such. The
remaining artifacts of chert, silicified wood, quartzite, ferruginous
sandstone, limonite, and siltstone are considered local, following Shafer's
analysis of lithic resources (Shafer 1973: 48-54).
The recovery of a Gahagan biface and a siltstone earspool was unexpected since these artifacts have previously been associated only with
the inner village (Shafer 1973: 224; Fritz 1975: 84). Their occurrence in
Unit 62 may be an indication that valued objects were not exclusively restricted to the inner villages. As more of the site is excavated, high
status artifacts can be expected to occur in outer village contexts, but
at a much lower frequency than within the inner villages.
resident

The 4 Alba arrow points represent what Shafer identifies as "the
arrow point type" (Ibid. 1973: 214). Chert is the source
of 3 specimens, silicified wood for the fourth. Shafer reports
of the non-burial sample of Alba points previously found were made
(Ibid.), and Fields reports 10 of 11 points as made of chert

51
(Fields 1978: 19-20). Therefore the 1978 TARL sample appears quite typical
of the Alba point collection at the Davis Site.
The Hayes point is an unusual find, for only 9 have been found
previously at the site, and only one of these was in an outer village context (Shafer 1973: 266-267). The 1978 TARL specimen is made of chert, as
were all those previously identified as Hayes. The points may have been
manufactured elsewhere and traded into the site (Ibid.: 343-344).
Previous excavations have shown that abraded, pitted, and polished
stones are common at the Davis Site, with over 400 found (Shafer 1973;
Fields 1978). Recovery of the 30 specimens in the 1978 TARL excavations
is not remarkable, and the specimens fit well into the previously defined
tool categories (Shafer 1973: 69-71). The 28 abraded and pitted stones
are mostly made of local ferruginous sandstone (60.7%), large grained
hematite (21.4%), or non-local Catahoula sandstone (17.8%), while the
polished stones are made of fine-grained hematite (100%).
The debitage collection is the largest sample of lithics from the
1973 TARL excavations, and some variations between the source materials
in the two septic drain fields can be noted. The percentage of chert
(68.2%) in the visitor center debitage is similar to that of the 1968-70
collection (62.3%) but lower than in the units east of Mounds B and C
excavated in 1977 (73.8%). Residence field debitage has a larger percentage
of chert (88.3%) than any of the other areas, and this is unusual, because
previous excavations have shown that chert debitage is more common in inner
village contexts. However, any comparison with the 1978 debitage collection
should take into account that the collection cannot be considered representative, due to small sample size. Quartzite made up 19.8% of the
visitor center debitage, close to the 1968-70 percentage (21.2%). The
residence field had less quartzite (4.4%). Silicified woon in the visitor
center field (12.0%) is slightly more common than in the 1968-70 collection
(9.2%), but again less so in the residence field (6.4%). Siltstone, sandstone, and other materials combined make up only 1.9% of the residence
field debitage, and are not found in the visitor center field.
The stages of reduction analysis presented in this report is not
similar to the analyses of debitage employed by Shafer or Fields, but
still seems to confirm the concept that the Caddoan lithic technology was
based on the manufacture of most chipped stone tools from flakes (Shafer
1973: 337-338). Tertiary flakes make up 54.9 and 53.3% of all debitage
in the two septic fields, indicating an emphasis on the reduction of
flakes. Secondary flakes make up 30.8 and 29.4% of the debitage, and
primary flakes only 3.3 and 2.1%.
Two other attributes can be noted for the debitage collection.
Edge modifications are present on only 7.5% of the specimens from the
residence field. Source materials are chert (98.1% of those modified)
and silicified wood (1.9%). This low frequency of edge modifications
within the debitage is unusual, since 20.2% of the 1968-70 debitage and
14.7% of the 1977 collection had modifications present. Heat scars have
also been noted on debitage at the Davis Site, and the 1978 TARL callee-

52
tion contains examples. Fractures and potlids from heating are present
on 7.3% of the debitage. Shafer considers such scars the result of
accidental contact with heat, or heating to alter the chipping quality
of the raw materials, but not "an intentional method of stone reduction
in the Davis Site assemblage" (Ibid.: 72).
The final lithic category was that of unmodified stones. Source
materials of ferruginous sandstone, limonite, and Catahoula sandstone are
also represented in the tool categories, so most of these specimens were
apparently unused raw materials. The 15 specimens of conglomerate
are different however, in that no tools or debitage of such stones were
recovered. Possibly, conglomerates were collected not as raw materials
for tool manufacture, but for uses that did not leave readily recognizable modifications.

Bone Artifacts
Poor preservation conditions have severely limited recovery of bone
artifacts at the Davis Site. Pins, flaking tools, and one ulna awl were
recovered from Mound C burials (Story 1972: 19-44). All other bone specimens from the site were either too fragmentary to identify or were
unmodified. All specimens from the 1978 TARL excavations were in Fl93-l.
Deer Ulnae
Three complete and 1 fragmentary tool were recovered. Two types
of modification are present; one of blunt, triangular tips; the other of
sharp, rounded points, each on the distal end of the bone shaft.
The first specimen is a left ulna recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 5
(Fig. 14-M). The overall length is 15 cm and the shaft remaining represents 8.7 cm of the length. Smoothing occurs down the entire length of
the shaft, with a rounded, sharp tip as the result· of modification.
Diameter of the tip is 1 nnn and the tip gradually expands back at a narrow angle of approximately 13° (measured from the tip back toward the
proximal end). The maximum width of the shaft is 1.8 cm at the base.
The reduction of the entire length of the shaft seems deliberate, and
not the result of repeated use.
The second ulna is also from the left side, and was recovered from
Fl93-l, undetermined zone (Fig. 14-L). The overall length is 10.2 cm,
only 4.2 cm of which is shaft. Smoothing and a light sheen are visible
on the entire shaft, but major reduction of the shaft width occurs only on
the last 0.7 cm, where the tip has been modified to a flat triangular
point. The angle of this point is approximately 65°, but after 0.7 cm the
shaft was left at its original width. The end of the tip is approximately
1 mm wide, and was apparently not intended to be very sharp.

53

The third ulna is again a left side, and was from Fl93-l, Zone 5
(Fig. 14-K). The overall length is 14 cm and the shaft makes up 8.8 cm
of this. A relatively blunt, flat, tapered tip has been formed, and the
shaft has been lightly smoothed. The natural ridge (interosseous crest)
on the shaft was not smoothed off, and the tip may have been modified on
one side only. The point forms an angle of 45°, but this extends back
only 0.5 cm before modifications end.
The last specinen is a broken shaft recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 8.
The length of the fragment is 4.7 cm, and it is smoothed down to a tapered,
blunt end as on the third specimen. A light sheen is present on the shaft.
The point angle is approximately 35°, but this extends back only 0.4 cm
before the shaft resumes normal, parallel sides.
Other Bones
One avian long bone, 1 deer metapodial, and 3 unidentified fragments are in this category. All are broken specimens.
The first artifact was recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 8, and is a
thin avian long bone, with one end modified to a point (Fig. 14-J). The
overall length is 11 cm, but approximately 0.2 cm of the tip is missing.
The entire shaft is smoothed and lightly polished.
The second specimen is from Fl93-1, Zone 4A. It is a small triangular fragment of an unidentified bone. The length is 1.4 cm, the tip
is sharpened to a width of only 0.5 mm. The broken basal end is 0.4 cm
wide.
The third bone is from Fl93-l, Zone 10, and is a thin cylindrical
fragment from an unknown animal (Fig. 14-H). The specimen is 3.4 cm
long, and is smoothed throughout its length. The tip is rounded, and is
1 to 3 mm in diameter. This specimen resembles the bone pins found previously in Mound C burials (Story 1972: 19-44).
The fourth fragment was recovered from Zone 16 of Fl93-l, and is
also a thin, cylindrical, unknown type of bone. The sharpened tip (if
any existed) is missing. The overall length is 3.7 cm and the diameter
is 0.2 cm. The shaft resembles the previous specimen in modification and
diameter.
The last bone artifact is a distal end fragment of a deer metapodial, recovered from Fl93-l, Zone 5 (Fig. 14-A). A circular hole,
0.2 cm in diameter, was drilled through the 1.0 x 1.2 x 1.6 cm fragment.

54
Summary of Bone Artifacts
The 9 artifacts recovered from Fl93-l may have been used for 3
different functions. The first deer ulna and the first 2 Other BonP.s appear
to be perforators. The tips are all thin, sharp and form narrow augles.
The other 3 ulnae may have been used as pressure flakers, similar to
those Shafer (1973: 67) mentioned for soft hammer flaking of stone tools,
since the tips are blunt and triangular. The third and fourth Other
Bones are similar to burial ornaments, and the drilled deer metapoaial may
have been an ornament as well. A final attribute of interest is that the
3 deer ulnae are all left sides, which makes them fit the right hand.

Shell Artifact
A marine shell with an abraded hole on the shoulder of the body
whorl was recovered from Fl93-l. The species has been identified as
Prunum apicina (Common Atlantic Marginella), which is found in shallow,
grassy waters along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts (Andrews 1977: 155).
The specimen is 1.1 cm long, 0.8 cm wide, and the abraded hole is 0.3 cm
in diameter. Marine shells have been previously found in Mound C burials
(Story: personal communication) but they did not include this species.

Historic Artifacts
A scatter (N=26) of historic artifacts was recovered from the plowzones of the excavation units, and from Fl91-l (Unit 60). The specimens
are 6 nails, 2 fence-post staples, 8 fragments of glass, 2 metal fragments,
3 pieces of wire, 1 glazed whiteware sherd, 3 glazed, brown sherds, and 1
.22 caliber bullet (Tables 8 and 9).

55
SU}!MA.RY A...'ID CONCLUSIONS
The excavations during the Fall 1978 season were carried out in
the northeastern corner of the Caddoan ~~unds State Historic Site under a
contract between the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department. The sites of two septic drain fields which
are to be installed in conjunction with the development of a visitor center
and a park superintendent residence were cleared for construction.
Five archeological units were opened and completely excavated. Ap62% of the area to be disturbed by the visitor center drain
field was excavated in three archeological units (Units 59, 60, and 61),
totalling 192 m2 in area. Of the residence drain field, approximately 80%
was excavated in two archeological units (Units 62 and 63), which totalled
145 m2 in area. In both cases, a sufficient sample was recovered to permit
a confident interpretation of the density, distribution, and character of
the cultural features and artifacts occurring within the drain field areas.
proxL~ately

In opening the units, a front-end loader was utilized to remove the
disturbed plowzone to a depth of 30-35 cm. Unit floors and walls were
then shovel-cleaned, trowelled, and examined for disturbances. The latter
were cross-sectioned to determine whether their origins were cultural or
natural. Where possible, the remainder of the fill was then removed from
the cultural features. At least 50% of the plowzone material from each
unit was passed through 1/4-inch hardware cloth in order to recover a reliable artifact sample for each area.
The aboriginal cultural features in both the visitor center and the
residence drain field areas are typical of outdoor activity areas previously
identified in Unit 16 south (Spock 1977: 116) and in Units 25, 34, and 35
(Fields 1978: 6, 14). In the visitor center drain field area, the definite
and possible aboriginal cultural features include a linear arrangement of
5 postholes, 3 isolated postholes, and 5 miscellaneous pits. A similar
linear pattern of 5 postholes, 5 isolated postholes, 2 charcoal-filled pits,
2 miscellaneous pits, an isolated hearth, and a large disturbance which
could be either an isolated posthole or a miscellaneous pit were identified
in the residence drain field area. Isolated lines of postholes and charcoal-filled pits are particularly typical of outdoor activity areas at the
Davis Site (Spock 1977: 179, 183-184). Most or all of the aboriginal cultural features appear to relate to the Caddoan occupation of the site.
Radiocarbon dating of three woody charcoal samples from a miscellaneous pit
(Fl93-1) in the residence drain field area indicate that the fill of that
feature originated during the period 886-1217 A.D., well within the time
span oi the early Caddoan component, which is believed to date from 780 to
1260 A.D. (Story and Valastro 1977: 67).
Modern cultural features were scarce in the visitor center drain
field area and absent from the residence drain field area. Within the
former, 3 modern features were identified. These seem to be auger holes
drilled to plant seedlings during the development of the peach orchard
which occupied the northeastern portion of the park until recent years. A
fourth cultural feature may represent the scar of a modern post removal.

56
A total of 1,316 artifacts were recovered from the 50% screening
sample of the plowzone, and another 1,872 artifacts were found in subplowzone cultural feature fill. The plowzone recovery yielded a density
of 4.82 to 13.76 artifacts per m3 of fill in the visitor center field,
and 35.58 to 57.13 artifacts per m3 in the residence field. Seven of the
cultural features contained a total of 60 artifacts and one (Fl93-l)
yielded the remaining 1,812.
In general, the aboriginal artifacts are identifiable as early
Caddoan. One sandy paste sherd, a sherd which is possibly of the type
Marksville Incised, a dart point fragment, and a possible dart preform are
the only evidence of pre-Caddoan occupation in the 1978 TARL excavations.
The aboriginal occupation of the site after abandonment of the primary
early Caddoan component may be represented by· 2 sherds tentatively identified as brushed. Within the early Caddoan collection, 5 Catahoula sandstone
tools, a Gahagan biface fragment, and a marine shell bead are the only artifacts readily identifiable as non-local in origin.
The artifacts of clay and stone which are local in origin are typical
of what has been previously identified in the outer village (Story and
Valastro 1977: 65; Fields 1978). However, the presence of a Gahagan biface
fragment, a pulley-shaped siltstone earspool, and 4 Red River pipe stems is
unusual. All of these items are fragments and may represent secondary distribution from the inner village.
The results of the analyses of the vertebrate and invertebrate
faunal remains follow in the attached appendices. A total of 5,837 vertebrate faunal specimens was recovered in situ and on the 1/4-inch screens.
Most of the specimens (5,789) were found in Fl93-l, Unit 62, and 2,739
(47.3%) of these were identifiable. Terrestrial species were more important than aquatic ones, with white-tailed deer and turkey dominating the
collection. There is some evidence suggesting domestication within the
latter. The upland forest was the most heavily exploited biological community, and passenger pigeons were identified in the collection (a first
for the site and the area). A total of 356 invertebrate faunal specimens
was recovered (all from Fl93-l). Of these, 219 (61.5%) were identifiable.
Freshwater pelecypods were certainly utilized as a food resource, but were
probably of minor importance within the total diet of the occupants. These
species may also have been the source of the pearls which appear in highstatus burial contexts within Mound C. Spatial continuity in faunal
resource utilization between the Davis Site and groups in the central Mississippi Valley during the 12th century may be indicated. Abundant microfaunal material was recovered in the course of the excavations by means of
1/16-inch water screening but has not been analyzed.
In summary, the units in both septic drain fields appear to be
outdoor activity areas typical of the outer village as defined by Story
(Story and Valastro 1972: 65). On the basis of both artifact and feature
densities, the use of the visitor center field area seems to have been
less intense than that of the residence field.

APPENDIX I
IDENTIFICATION OF THE VERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS FROM UNIT 62
Kenneth A. Lord and J. Peter Thurmond

Introduction
Vertebrate faunal remains were recovered from the plowzone of
Unit 62 and two trash-filled pits (Fl93-l and Fl93-3) within that excavation unit. The bulk of the collection is from Fl93-l. The unusually
good preservation of the faunal material (for the Davis Site) within that
feature, due to the neutral pH of its fill, greatly facilitated taxonomic
classification. However, as most of the material was recovered from that
single context, the validity of the sample as a representation of faunal
resource utilization at the site is questionable.
The specimens from Fl93-l totalled 5,789, of which 2,739 (47.3%)
were identifiable to some taxonomic level, and 3,050 (52.7%) were unidentifiable. Table 1 lists the number of specimens of each taxonomic
category from Fl93-l by fill zone. Two different estimates of the minimum number of individuals cepresented by the more discrete faunal categories
in Fl93-l are provided in Table 2. The first estimate is based on each
stratum as a separate provenience; the second considers the entire feature
a single provenience. Table 3 provides estimates of the amount of useable
meat represented by the mammalian and avian species (formulae for such
calculations for the reptilian and ichthyic species were not available).
The vertebrate faunal specimens recovered elsewhere in Unit 62
are listed below:

rne specimens dealt with in this analysis are only those recovered
in situ or on the 1/4-inch screen. The 1/16-inch water screen material has
not been analyzed. All of the fill of Fl93-l and Fl93-3 was passed through
a 1/4-inch screen (excluding matrix samples), and 50% of the Unit 62 plowzone was 1/4-inch screened.
Discussion
Comparative data on vertebrate f aunal specimens recovered in
previous excavations at the Davis Site are available in Keller's (1974:
230) Appendix, Table 1.
White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of a variety of ages
were represented. Three young adults between 15 and 22 months in age
have been identified, primarily on the basis of mandibular and maxillary
tooth remains. These sub-adult individuals retain their milk dentition.
Generally the third molar, while possibly present, has not yet broken the
gum line. A number of bones, especially long bones, evidence unfused
epiphyses. This generally indicates younger individuals, but the sequence
of fusion is not sufficiently well-documented to age the animals. At
least twelve adult individuals were recovered from Fl93-l. A proportion
of these were males, as evidenced by antler growth. In one case the
animal still retained the antlers, indicating the time of death as between
June and January. An older individual is also represented. Based on the
condition of the teeth, this deer was probably 7 years or more in age at
the time of death. The collection reflects the presence of most portions
oi the deer skeleton. Skull parts, mandibles, and ribs are all common.
Only a few small fragments of metapodials were present, however. These
dense bones of the lower legs generally preserve well, and are a favorite
in bone tool manufacture. The absence of metapodials may therefore indicate removal from the carcasses for tool manufacture before the remains
were thrown into the pit.
Two species of squirrel were identified. The attribute used to
differentiate the two is a small, peg-like upper P 3 found on the gray
squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). The fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) lacks
this tooth. Identifications separating the two can therefore be accomplished only when maxillary sections are available. All other specimens
have been identified to genus only. There are several additional differences between the species. These include size, color, and preferred
habitat. The gray squirrels of Texas live mainly in dense hammocks of
live oak and water oak, and in deep swamps of cypress, black gum, and
magnolia. Upland forests are usually devoid of gray squirrels (Davis
1974: 143). Fox squirrels, on the other hand, are adaptable to a wide
range of forest habitats; but in most areas, open upland forests of a
mixed character support the heaviest populations (Ibid.: 145).
Other mammalian remains include cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.),
pocket gopher (Geomys sp.J, and gray fox (Urocyon argentus). These
species occur infrequently and warrant no further discussion.

92

Avian remains were more common in Fl93-l. The specimens include
at least 27 individuals of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes miqratorius) ,
a species which has been extinct since 1914*. The presence of the species
at the Davis Site is not surprising, as eastern Texas lies within its
normal recorded range (Schorger 1955: 257). The specimens do however apparently represent the third occurrence of passenger pigeon discovered to
date within an archeological context in Texas. The specimens previously
identified were, in both cases, from Bowie County. Approximately 50-60%
of the skeleton of one individual was found at the Mitchell Site (41 BW 4)
inside of a Pease Brushed Incised vessel in a Caddoan burial (B-52)
(Christopher J. Jurgens, personal communication). At the Hatchel Site
(41 BW 3), a single left humerus was recovered from the floor of a structure (FlS) on the Phase H mound platform (identification was confirmed
by Lyndon L. Hargrave, letter dated 4/24/75, .on file at TARL).
Turkey remains (Meleaqris gallopavo) were identified in Fl93-l.
The specimens were generally of moderate size. Several bones were relatively large in comparison to modern domesticated turkey. Hargrave (1966)
has noted that an increase in size may be associated with the domestication
of the turkey in the Southwest. The large specimens from Fl93-l thus hint
at the possibility of turkey domestication at the Davis Site. Pinkley
(1965) has noted that the behavioral characteristics of turkeys favor
domestication wherever the birds occur in conjunction with a sedentary
human population. Turkey domestication is therefore a possibility that
faunal analysts working with collections from Caddoan sites, and from
Mississippian sites in general, should keep in mind. Other avian remains
could not be identified.
Reptilian remains were almost exclusively confined to turtles.
The majority of identifiable specimens were of box turtle, most probably
the eastern box turtle (Terrepene carolina). This species is common in
East Texas today. Other turtle remains were not identifiable. One
plastron fragment may represent one of the larger water turtles, possibly
Pseudemys sp. One snake vertebra was also recovered. It was from the
genus Elaphe.
Ichthyic remains were rather scarce in the material analyzed,
although remains of gar (Lepisosteus sp.) were present. Some of the gar
scales present suggest the alligator gar (L. spatula). Other ichthyic
remains include 1 specimen of a bass of the genus Micropterus, and the
maxillary plate of a freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens). Although
the 1/16-inch screen material remains largely unanalyzed, three samples
from Zones 4 and 5 were examined for the presence of ichthyic scales.
Numerous scales of freshwater drum (A. grunniens), freshwater sucker
(Catostomidae sp.J, bluegill sunfish (Leopomis cf. macrochirus), and black
crappie (Pomoxis cf. nigromaculatus) were present (Christopher J. Jurgens,
personal communication), but have not been tallied in Table 1.

*This

identification was confirmed by Dr. Paul Parmalee of the University
of Tennessee in a letter dated 4/7/79, on file at TARL. We are indebted
to Dr. Parmalee for his assistance.

--

Specimens recovered outside of Fl93-l were generally too decomposed for identi:ication, and the total collection is too small for
significant comment to be made.

Conclusions
The exploitation of many of the species which Keller (1974: 78-81)
lists as available within a 5 mile radius of the site is confirmed.
Terrestrial species seem to have been of much greater importance than
aquatic ones. Within the terrestrial fauna, if one calculates the amount
of useable meat represented by the mammalian ~nd avian species, the relative importance of white-tailed deer and (secondarily) turkey is striking.
The most heavily exploited area seems to have been the upland forest,
where deer, turkey, fox squirrel, and cottontail rabbit would have been
abundant. The passenger pigeons and at least some of the deer seem to
have been taken during the late fall or winter.
As noted above, the limited context of the f aunal material casts
doubt upon its reliability as a representative sample. Further, the
concentration upon in situ and 1/4-inch screen material has undoubtedly
biased the sample. Fish in particular are probably underrepresented.
However, it is interesting that the remains from Fl93-l seem to fit quite
well a model of f aunal resource utilization hypothesized by Smith (1974)
for 7 Middle Mississippi sites of the Powers Phase in northeastern
Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, and southwestern Tennessee. That model
proposes that Middle ~.ississippi exploitation of f aunal populations was
species-selective, was seasonally uriented, and was concentrated on those
portions of the biotic community which would provide a maximum meat yield
with a minimum of effort (Ibid.: 274). Specifically, Smith predicts that
15 species will account for at least 95% of the total projected meat yield
at any give site (Ibid.: 280). The 5 species of that group which were
present in Fl93-l (white-tailed deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit, fox
squirrel, and gray squirrel) account for 98.4% of the total projected
meat yield of the feature. This estimate .is based on those species for
which useable meat calculations could be made (fish and reptiles are not
included). Further, Smith predicts that, in percentage of useable meat
represented, deer will rank first, and turkey and squirrels will rank
within the top five. At sites not occurring within the meander belt of
a river (i.e., in close conjunction with aquatic resources), cottontail
rabbit and fox squirrel will outnumber swamp rabbit and gray squirrel,
and the importance of aquatic resources will be secondary (Ibid.: 280)
Finally, maximum utilization of deer and other terrestrial species will
occur during the late fall and winter (Ibid.: 281-285).
The collection from Fl93-l seems to conform to these predictions.
Occupation of the Middle Mississippi sites under consideration by Smith
spanned the period 1000-1500 A.D. (Ibid.: 275). Radiocarbon dating
indicates a maximum age for the fill of Fl93-l of 886-1217 A.D., contemporaneous with the lower end of that time span. Spatial continuity in
faunal resource exploitation strategies may therefore be suggested between
the Davis Site and the Middle Mississippi Valley during the 11th to 13th
centuries.

ANALYSIS OF THE

~10LLUSCAN

FAUNA FROM Fl93-l, UNIT 62

Raymond W. Neck

-

Introduction
The Davis Site (41 CE 19) is located in the Austroriparian Biotic
Province (Blair 1950), a large area of mixed hardwood and pine forest
which encompasses the Caddoan area of eastern Texas. Usually only limited
faunal material is available from sites in this part of Texas, due to the
acidi~ nature of the soils.
However, excellent bone and shell preservation occurred in Fl93-l, a trash-filled pit in Unit 62, because of the
high pH of its fill. This has allowed a rare glimpse at faunal resource
utilization by the Caddoan occupants of the site. Herein is reported the
molluscan material recovered from Fl93-l. A total of 356 specimens
has been analyzed (Table 1).

Species List
PELECYPODA:
Amblemidae
A.Thlema plicata (Say) is well distributed throughout the Mississippi
River drainage basin and adjacent Gulf Coastal Plain river systems.
It is most abundant on mud bottoms in slow-moving streams, adapting
well to artificial impoundments, where it occurs to moderate depths
of about 2.5 meters.
Fusconaia askewi (Marsh) occurs in much the same habitats, but is
limited in range to Louisiana and eastern Texas. .It often occurs in
somewhat shallower water with slightly higher velocity.
Plectomerus dombeyanus (Valenciennes) occurs in the lower Mississippi
River basin and numerous adjacent Gulf Coastal Plain river systems.
It is found on varying substrates in slow-moving water.
Quadrula nodulata (Say) is found throughout the Mississippi River
system and Gulf Goastal Plain river systems west of the Mississippi.
This species is usually found in larger streams on muddy bottoms,
but has been found on gravel bottoms.

Quadrula pastulosa (Lea) has a geographical range and habitat requirements similar to Q. nodulata, but Q. pustulosa is found more often on
sandy bottoms with slightly slower-moving water.
Quadrula quadrula (Rafinesque) exhibits tremendous variation in shell
morphology. It is generally distributed throughout the Mississippi
River basin, but is especially abundant in rivers of eastern and central Texas. In artificial impoundments, this species appears to be
more abundant on sandy substrates, but Q. quadrula is common in slowmoving mud-bottomed creeks and lacustrine backwaters.
Tritogonia verrucosa (Rafinesque) occurs in the Mississippi River
basin and Gulf Coastal Plain river systems to the east and west. It
generally indicates faster-moving water than most of the previous
species, on both sand and mud substrates.
Unionidae
Uniomerus tetralasmus (Say) occurs in the lower Mississippi River
system and adjacent Gulf Coastal Plain rivers. It is characteristic
of slow-moving backwaters, but is often found in temporary bodies of
water. U. tetralasmus exists buried in dried bottom sediments between rainfall events.
Lampsilis anodontoides (Lea) is found in the southeastern United
States, Mississippi River drainage basin, and throughout Texas into
Mexico. It is found in slow-moving water on mud and sand bottoms.
Lampsilis hydiana (Lea) is found in eastern Texas and eastward through
the lower Mississippi River system into Alabama. It is generally
found in slow-moving water, on mud substrates.
Ligumia nasuta (Say) form subrostrata (Say) is found throughout the
Mississippi River basin and into eastern Texas. It is found on both
sand and mud bottoms in slow-moving or ponded water.
Obliquaria reflexa (Rafinesque) is found throughout the Mississippi
River drainage, eastward to Georgia, and westward to Texas. It is
generally found in faster-moving water on variable substrates.

GASTROPODA:
Helicinidae
Helicina orbiculata (Say) is the only terrestrial operculate snail in
eastern Texas. It is common throughout most of Texas in woodlands and
prairies.
Zonitidae
Zonitoides arboreus (Say) is found under logs and rocks in woodland
areas.

100
Bulimulidae
Rabdotus dealbatus dealbatus (Say) is found in riparian woodlands in
eastern and central Texas.
Polygyridae
Praticolella pachyloma (Menke) is indicative of sandy, wooded habitats in east central and eastern Texas.
Mesodon thyroidus (Say) is found in relatively mesic woodlands of
east central and eastern Texas.
Triodopsis cragini (Call) is characteristic of mesic woodlands in
eastern Texas.
Marginellidae
Prunum apicina (Menke) is very common along the Gulf Coast in shallow,
grassy waters.

Discussion
The Pelecypoda are all freshwater species which were probably collected in nearby Bowles Creek or the Neches River. Some of the species
from faster-moving water could be from either source. Species from very
slow-moving or standing water, e.g. Uniomerus tetralasmus, could have been
collected from the creek or from small oxbows like that between the occupation site and the creek. At any rate, all specimens could have been
collected from very nearby sources. The umbones of nearly all of the clams
were highly eroded, indicating origins from acidic waters.
While some of the intact valves are charred, the majority are not
(7 were burned, 81 were not). However, the frequency of burning differs
for the valve fragments (71 were burned, 86 were not). The higher frequency of burning apparent in the valve fragments undoubtedly reflects the
tendency of shell to disintegrate when exposed to intense heat. The division of the collection into burned and unburned specimens could reflect
two different methods of preparation (e.g. roasting vs. boiling, or
roasting vs. no cooking). However, given the association of the shells
with numerous burned sherds, flakes, and bones, it seems likely that all
were charred after they had been discarded. Only one definite pair of
valves from the same individual could be identified (one pair of Ligumia
nasuta f. subrostrata). The lack of additonal pairs may indicate that
one valve was destroyed either before or after cooking in an effort to
extract the animal (assuming they were cooked). The two most abundant
species show no definite predilection concerning handedness (Lampsilis
anodontoides: 6 right, 11 left valves; Fusconaia flava flava: 19 right,
17 left valves).

These clam valves are generally small, indicating collection from
a suboptimal (from the clam's viewpoint) habitat, or a population which was
subject to continual predation, possibly by humans. The latter possibility
is questionable, as relatively few pelecypods have been recovered in earlier
excavations at the Davis Site (Newell and Krieger 1949: 181; Story 1972:
18-52). However, the apparent dearth of pelecypods is quite possibly the
result of a preservational bias. As noted above, soil conditions at the
site are unsuited to the preservation of organic materials, and few faunal
remains have been recovered in general (Keller 1974: Appendix, Table 1).
A large number of the pelecypod valves have small attached pearls on their
interior surfaces, indicating an origin from a sandy substrate. It is
therefore quite possible that some or all of the pearls which were recovered
from three burials (Fll8, 119 and 161) within Mound C (Story 1972: 39, 46,
50) are of local origin.
The land snails are typical of the macro-gastropods to be expected
from an east Texas mesic woodland site with sandy soils. None of these
shells are charred. The snails are probably intrusive individuals not
associated with aboriginal utilization. In fact, many individuals of the
most common species, Praticolella pachyloma, are modern, as indicated by
the presence of the periostracum layer, which rapidly deteriorates (especially in mesic, acid soil conditions).
The only marine species, Prunus apicina, is represented by a single
individual. A small aperture was opened in its shoulder by means of abra~
sion, and the specimen was undoubtedly used as a bead. The shell was
presumably introduced through trade. Although beads manufactured from
marine gastropods have been recovered from Mound C burial contexts (Dee Ann
Story, personal communication), P. apicina has not been previously identified at the site.
The assumption that the freshwater clams from this excavation
represent food items is based on two premises: 1) additional (vertebrate)
faunal remains were found in association (Appendix 1), and 2) there is no
evidence on these valves of use as tools (e.g. the possible hoe illustrated
by Sayles 1935: Plate XXIII, f) or of any other modification. Modified
mussel shells have been recovered in previous excavations; 2 edge-modified
valves, 8 mussel shell pendants, and several tiny cut pieces of mussel
shell which had been used with copper as an overlay on a wooden imitation
of a carnivore tooth were recovered from burial (Fl55) in Mound C (Story
1972: 41-44). It is also interesting to note that of the mussel shells
recovered in Newell's excavations within and about Mound A, approximately
400 were found in a mass on the floor of a submound structure (F32), 15
were found in the mound in a tightly nested mass, and 8 were found in a
discrete cluster in Inner Village A (Newell and Krieger 1949: 181). The
clusters within and under the mound in particular could represent caches
of raw material for use by presumably part-time specialists in the manufacture of mussel shell artifacts like those recovered from Fl55.
The low caloric value of freshwater mussels generally precludes
utilization of these animals as a sole nutrient for human populations, unless those populations were of a very low density (Parmalee and Klippel

---------------------------

102

1974). Notwithstanding this low food energy value, mussels have been utilized for food by many cultures, including the Illinois Indians of the
Hopewell Culture (Matteson 1953). Utilization of freshwater mussels by
aboriginal inhabitants of the Davis Site was probably ancillary to the
consumption of other faunal species.
