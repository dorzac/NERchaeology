THE TYPE, DISTRIBUTION, AND
OCCURRENCE OF FLINT
GRAVERS IN TEXAS
By

WELTY WRIGI~T

Gravers are those artifacts made by the Indians for the purpose
of engraving bone, shell, horn, wood, and stone. They are, in most
cases, made of a material having a fine grain and a dense composition with a conchoidal fracture, such as flint, jasper, chert, chalcedony, agate, and similar materials. They consist of a short sharp
point, flat on the under surface and triangular in cross-section,
worked on a fortuitous flake, a scraper, or some other artifact.
As in most artifacts there was a development from a more rough
and primitive form. The first gravers were probably any hard
stone, with a natural break leaving a sharp point, suitable for engraving. These although roughly serving the purpose, were easily
blunted and probably unsuited for holding in the hand. We know
that the primitive engravers did use naturally formed gravers, because all through the Southwest we find quartz crystals whose naturally sharp ends have been blunted by use. From this beginning
the engravers learned through experience what materials and shapes
were best adapted to engraving, and then they learnd to further
improve upon natural gravers by making and shaping gravers to
suit their needs.
Study of gravers shows that three principal types can be distinguished. There are variations within the types, but basically they
fall within one of the three types.
Type I is designated simply as graver.
Type H is the chisel-graver.
Type IH is the graver usually made by reworking a former artifact.
For convenience, Type I will be divided into Type Ia and Type
Ib.

There is no appreciable difference between the gravers, the

difference being in the piece upon which the graver is worked.

Type Ia may be called the flake graver, as the graver point is
worked on a simple fortuitous flake. There is very little if any
workmanship exhibited other than around the graver point. The
maker simply took advantage of a conveniently shaped flake and
worked a graver point on it. Such flint flakes usually exhibit a dorsal ridge which resulted from the striking off of two large flakes.
This dorsal ridge usually tapers out to an edge, and the maker by
chipping out an indentation on each side of this dorsal ridge, where
it tapers, out to the edge, secured a short sharp point, triangular in
cross-section, consequently strong and not easily broken. The under
surface of Type Ia is always flat, the result of the striking off of
one single flake.
Type Ib is essentially the same as Type Ia as far as the graver
point is concerned. Type Ib is a combination tool. The most frequent combinations are of the graver-scraper type, both side and
snub-nosed scrapers being found in combination with the graver.
The graver point on Type Ia and on Type Ib is made in the same
way with the exception that where the ridge around which the point
is chipped on Type Ia is natural the one on Type Ib ba~ to be
flaked out, and as a result more work was necessary in making
Type Ib.
Type II is the chisel-graver. It is made in ~nuch the same manner
as Type I but the shape is altogether different. The chisel-graver
is easily recog-nized by its point, which is broader than Type I, and
usually straight across the end; sometimes, however, it is convex.
Another characteristic feature is the distinct bevel on the end of the
point, giving it a chisel-like appearance; too, the point is usually
longer than that on Type I.

The workmanship on this type is usually

better and the whole artifact has been given definite shape.
Type III, if it can be called a graver, is usually made by reworking fragments of former artifacts, such as knives, choppers,
arrow points, and occasionally one is found on what is apparently
a complete artifact.

This type does not come under the definition

of gravers as given at the beginning of this paper, but since this type
is .recognized as a graver in Central and East Texas it is well to
include a discussion of it. Future studies of gravers may either
confirm this type as a graver, or definitely prove it not to be.

III differs from the other types in that it lacks tho flat under surface. It has been worked on all faces and conforms more nearly
to the drill or borer in shape. The only thing which distinguishes
it from the drill or borer is that the point is too short to have been
of much value in making perforations of any sort. This type could
have served for engraving, and evidently did, for we find engraved
artifacts in the region in which they predominate and in which very
few true gravers are found. The difficulty wifla Type III is in
being able to distinguish between gravers and drills or borers.
The size of gravers varies within the various types. In Type Ia
the flakes on which graver points have been worked vary from
pieces three-eighths of an inch in diameter to pieces three inches in
diameter and one-half inch thick. The graver points are of the
same type, however, although one may be minute and have a needlelike point while the other is heavier and consequently much stronger.
The small specimens seem to predominate in the North Panhandle,
while the large specimens predominate in the Abilene region.
Type Ib has its variations in size also; .however, the variations
are not so great as in Type Ia.
Type II is the least numerous of all types and like Type Ia the
small specimens come from the North Panhandle, while the heavier
and larger specimens come from the Abilene region and East Texas.
Type III has a great variation in size.

In Central Texas, in the

burnt rock middens, large choppers or knives four inches long will
have a small sharp point on one end, and from the same region a
small reworked arrow point one-half inch long will have a similar
point.

The wide range in sizes allowed for a variety of uses.

The very small needle-like graver points would have served excellently for tattooing, a use which Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
suggests.1 The larger forms would have served for notching arrow
shafts, or cupping atlatl shafts, in the making of bone awls and
needles, and for engraving designs.
There has been some objection to calling these artifacts gravers
because they are not the same as those found in Europe. This argu1.

ment is weak because there are variations in the types of gravers
or burins found in Europe. Some of the gravers found here are
very similar to some of the European types, yet they are not recognized as such simply because they are not exactly like those in
Europe. We have artifacts in the Southwest which are definitely
engraved, and since there are no other tools which could serve the
purpose better than those designated as gravers, why not accept the
fact that, though they are not European in type, they are still
gravers ?
Evidence seems to point to the fact that gravers have practically
covered the known span of manâs existence in America. They, or
evidence of their use, have been found with some of the supposedly
most ancient cultures in the Southwest. Its distribution seen~ to be
limited to the western portion of the United States and Canada.
Mr. Porter Montgomery of Dalhart, Texas, has sixty-two gravers
which he has collected in Dallam and Hartley Courtty, Texas, and
Texas County, Oklahoma. Nearly all of these specimens have
come from blow-out sites in what were once Pleistocene lake beds.
They are found on the surface with Folsom and Yuma artifacts and
fossil bones of the horse, camel, elephant, bison, and several species
of unidentified fresh water shells. There are forty-four of Type Ia,
fourteen of Type Ib, three of Type II, and one of Type III, a reworked Folsom point.
Dr. Cyrus N. Ray of Abilene, Texas, has the most extensive collection of artifacts from that region which has a wealth of archeological sites. Dr. Ray has made an extensive study of the Abilene region and its artifacts during the last twelve years. Dr. Rayâs work
has been mostly of a reconnaissance nature, and no major excavation work has been done yet, although the Works Progress Administration has recently begun such an excavation under the sponsorship of Texas Technological College. The report when published
should give us valuable information with regard to the stratigraphy
of the various cultures found in that region.
In a letter to the writer, Dr. Ray has the following to say conPlate 7

cerning gravers. "The flint gravers are mainly found here in the
Clear Fork Culture. The artifacts of that culture are occasionally
found on old eroded surfaces with Folsorn points.
"A few long narrow beautifully made scrapers of s~nall size have
graver points at the ends opposite to the cutting ends.

These and a

type of side scraper having a small sharp graver in the center are
quite likely of a later type.

"The European types of gravers found with the Clear Fork Culture are: 1, Beak shaped points on flint flakes; 2, small narrow
chisel points on flakes; and 3, multiple points on flakes; sometimes
two and infrequently more points on one flake."
In an article entitled, "~m Pottery Complex Artifacts of the
Abilene Region," published in the Texas .4rcheological and Paleontological Society Bulletin, Vol. 7, 1935, Dr. Ray describes tile combination graver-~raper. "In Site No. 17 a distinctive form of very
small, finely flaked, narrow keel-backed scraper occurs. Many of
these have the ends opposite to the round cutting ends brought to
sharp points, so that such a tool could be used as a scraper ou one
end, and as a graver on the other."
Gravers of the Clear Fork Culture are found in the Abilene region
along what were evidently small streams, now dry, and apparently
dry for a long period of time. The gravers and other Clear Fork
artifacts are eroded from several feet below the surface in old mountain side catnpsites and from gravel terrace deposits along dry
branches of creeks. The~ specimens are deeply patinated and very
similar to paleolithic types of Europe.~
Dr. Ray has sixty gravers of the Clear Fork type, which are heavily patinated.

From Site No. 17 he has thirty-one of the combina-

tion graver-scraper type, some of which are patinated.

With a skeleton of the Abilene Man type, three bone tubes, each
about three inches long, were found. These had an incised design
on them showing the use of a graver.3 However, Dr. Ray has never

found any of the Clear Fork Cuhure artifacts with burials of the
Abilene Man and the Abilene points are regarded as much older
than the Clear Fork.
In the Abilene region we appear to have gravers associated with
some of the oldest cultures, regarded by some authorities a~ the
ohtest cultures yet found in A~nerica.

Andrews County has yielded four gravers, three of Type Ib now
in Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona, and one of Type III which is in the
collection of Mr. W. C. Fritz of Midland, Texas.
Mr. Powell Goodwin submitted data on seven gravers from Archer County.

Of five from a surface site on Onion Creek, two are

of Type Ia, two of Type Ib, and one of Type III.

From a site on

the South Fork of the Little Wichita two gravers of Type la wereâ
found.
From Bandera County the University of Texas has two gravers.
One, a large tanged knife or spear point measuring three and oneball inches by one and three-fourths inches was found fifty-three
inches below the surface on the J. W. Edwards farm. The other
specimen measuring two and one-half inches by one and fiveeighths inches, from the same site, twenty inches below the surface.z~

Mr. A. E. Anderson of Brownsville reports that in his collection
from Cameron County he has an excellent graver of Type Ia; a
thin flake about one inch square with ma excellent point worked in
the middle of one side. He also reports other flakes suitable for
gravers, but exhibiting no type characteristics.
From Cass County there are four gravers of Type III. Two
are small and were found at depths of eight and eleven ind~es on
the Clements Brot h er âs farm. Another, apparently a reworked portion of an arrow point, was found three and one-half inches below the
surface on the E. A. Coker farm. The fourth was found on the
Goode Hunt farm.
Cherokee County has one graver of Type Ib which was found
From now on when no owner is mentioned it is to be ~nderstood that the

twenty inches below the surface in site ET-221. It is a combination side scraper-graver which is very well made.
Clay Count~ is represented by one graver of Type Ia which was
reported by Mr. D. L. Bennett of Henrietta, Texas.
The University of Texas also has one of Tye Ill, a reworkcd point
or knife. One of the Type la specimens is unusnal in that the
point is the longest seen by the writer while making this study. The
point is five-eighths inch long, but has the flat under surface and
beveled edges characteristic of the graver point. It could be a
transitional form between the graver and the drill, as some anthorities seem to think that the drill or awl had its beginning in
the short graver points.5
From d~c Willis Cutp farm, Coryell County, there are two gravers
of Type III. One is a small roughly flaked knife with a sharp
point on each end; the other is a large chopper with a point on
one end.

Type Ia specimen has two point.s, one of which is very similar to that
described frown Comanche County in that the point is unusually
long. It could be another transition form, but shows no evidence
of having been used in a boring or drilling motion, which certainly
would have sheared the thin edges. Just behind the base of the long
point is a typical graver.
From the P. G. Hightower farm in Franklin County there is one
specimen of Type IlL It is a reworked arrow point, and came from
a depth of twenty-two inches.
From the Espirita Santo Mission site in Goliad County there are
three gravers of Type III. They were found at depths of twentyone and thirty-two inches. The depth of the third is not known.
Mr. Floyd Seaman of Plainview, Hale County, Texas, has sixteen
gravers which he has found in surface sites where occasional Folsom
and Yuma artifacts are found. Four are of Type Ia, ten are of
Type Ib, one is of Type II, and one is of Type III.
Henderson County has yielded one graver of Type III from the
De Rossett farm three and one-half miles northeast of Frankston.
The farm of Mrs. H. L. Culpepper in Hopkins County yielded
one graver of Type III from a depth of seventeen inches.
Two gravers of Type la from Hutchinson County are in the Gila
Pueblo collection, Globe, Arizona.
From the Works Progress Administration excavation, sponsored
by Texas Technological College, at the Hedge site in Jones County
there is one graver of Type Ia. It is the only graver from the
Abilene region on which there is a definite stratification. It was
found in the fourth level of occupation from the top at a depth of
eighteen feet and eight inches. It was stratified with a bifurcated
asymmetrical projectile point. It is possibly related to the lowest
level of the Central Texas burnt rock middens.6

The others were surface finds,
Mr, Robert Radfield has given to the University of Texas two
gravers of Type III from Lee County.
Lubbock County has yielded one graver of Type Ia from a site
about three and one-half miles northwest of the town of Lubbock.

In Morris County one graver of Type III has been found on the
R. L. Cason farm at a depth of fourteen inches.
Mr. Temple Rominger has in his collection a graver of Type Ib
trom Bitter Creek in Nolan County. It is a thick side scraper with
a graver worked on one end.
From the C. W. Ellis farm in Polk County the University of
Texas has three gravers of Type III. One is a reworked arrow point
and the other two are reworked fragments of knives.
From Presidio County there is one graver of Type III.

From Webb Island, Nueces County, Texas, there is one graver
of Type IIl. Another very unusual form is a graver of Type II
which is made of shell. It has all the characteristics of a graver of
Type II made from flint. Mr. A. T. Jackson has suggested that
since there is a scarcity of flint on the island and there is some
inci~d pottery, it would have ~rved very well for incising plastic
pottery.
San Patricio County has one recorded graver of Type lb, a nicely
worked thin scraper with a graver worked on one end.
From Fall Creek, Site 2, Midden 1 in San Saba County there is
one graver of Type III.
Mr. Floyd Seaman has iu his collection one graver of Type Ia
from the Poelake farm in Swisher County.
In the Gila Pueblo collection there is one graver from Terrell
County. It is of Type Ib and exhibits fair workmanship.
From Titus County there are three gravers. One a knife with a
graver on one end, was found on the surface on the Farrar Brotherâs
farm. Another of Type III was found on the W. A. Ford site, and

Texas Archeological and Paleo~to!ogical Society

the third is a knife with a graver at one end from the Thomas B.
Ca]dwell plantation, and was found at a depth of fifteen inches.

Travis County has yielded several gravers, all of Type III except
one which is doubtfully Type II. The Type II specimen is in all
probability a chisel as the point is five-sixteenths inch wide. It
came from a depth of forty-two inches on the Sid W. Stewart place.
Two other specimens of Type III come from this same site. From the
Percy Hancock place, Site 8, Mound 2, a graver of Type III found
at a depth of twenty-one inches has been reported. Two specimens
of Type III came from the J. H. Hudson place, about three and
one-half miles northeast of Tcck and one-half nfile west of the
river. From the A. J. Trammell farm in Travis County there is one
graver of Type III found thirty-two inches below the surface. There
is also one graver of Type Ib from Williamson County.
At a site four and one-half miles east of Quitman, Wood County,
Texas, a graver of Type III was found on the surface.
Mr. A. T. Jackson reports a graver, Type III, from the recently
excavated Morhiss Mound, about ~ven miles southeast of Victoria
on the east side of dm Guadalupe River, Victoria County, Texas.
It is apparently part of a broken knife which had a graver on one
end. It was found at a depth of eighty inches.
From Site NT-5, M. D. Harrell farm, Junction of the Clear Fork
and Salt Fork of the Brazos River, one mile north of South Bend,
Young County, Texas, Mr. Jackson reports two gravers of Type
III.

One, found at a depth of fourteen inches, has three graver

points on it, two of which could have been used for engraving
parallel lines or a circle. The other has only one point, and was
found at a depth of twenty-two inches. Mr. Powell Goodwin reports three gravers, one each of Types Ia, Ib, and IIl, from a she
on the Brazos River near New Castle, Young County. He also has
one each of Type Ia and III from a site about twelve miles up the
Brazos from New Castle.

From Hansford County, Texas, Mr. Vincent Dale of Guymon,
Oklahoma, has one graver of Type lb.
Mr. J. Charles Kelley reports a number of gravers from the Big
Bend Area, but does not state from which counties they come. These

Type, Di~ibu$ion and Occu~âences of Ftin$ Gravers

43

specimens have been tentatively dated at 4,000 B. C. in the lowest
level and 1700 A. D. in the upper level.
The distribution of gravers outside of Texas is as follows:
Mr. Vincent Dale of Guymon, Oklahoma, has ten gravers of Type
Ia, two of Type Ib, four of Type II, and three of Type III, from
Texas County, Okla. From a site in Cimmaron County, Oklahoma,
he has one of Type Ia. All are from surface sites.
Mr. David A. Baerreis of the University of Oklahoma reports two
gravers from Hopewellian sites, one at the mouth of Honey Creek
in Delaware County and the other from a site near the mouth of
the creek.. Both are of Type IIL
From New Mexico there is a record of two sites where gravers
have been found. Mr. E. B. Howard of the University of Pennsylvania reports at least twenty gravers from the Clovis site near
Clovis, New Mexico. The horizon from which they come is Folsom
and Yuma.
Mr. Frank C. Hibben, Curator of the Museum of Anthropology
of the University of New Mexico, reports a number of gravers from
Sandia Cave near Albuquerque, New Mexico, and says the association with Folsom artifacts there is very definite.
From Colorado there is the report of Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
on the Lindenmeier site near the Wyoming line.

Here again there

is definite association of the graver with the Folsom Culture. In
all probability gravers have been found in other parts of Colorado
as Folsom and Yuma artifacts have come from a number of sites in
the state.
Mr. W. D. Strong reports some seventy-seven gravers from Signal
Butte, Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. These are stratified in three
levels and are very similar to those from the Lindenmeier site in
Colorado.

From Carbon County, Wyoming, two gravers of Type III, and
flâom Sweetwater County, four of Type III, have been reported. All
are reworked arrow points. There are also, two gravers of Type
Ib from Sweetwater County. All the gravers from Wyoming were
~eported by Mr. J. G. Ata,âood of Rawlings, Wyoming, who says he

Texas Archeological c~nd Paleontological Society

finds a number of Folsom and Yuma artifacts in the same region.
All are surface finds.
From California we have the report of the Campbells on the Lake
.Mohave site which lies between Soda Lake and Silver Lake some
sixty-five miles northeast of Barstow, Califoria. Some forty gravers
of Type Ib have been reported from this site.
In the January, ]939, issue of American Antiquity pages 277 to
279, Mr. E. B. Howard reports on some Folsom and Yuma artifacts
~ound in the region around Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

Among

the arti~[acts found are gravers, three of which are illustrated. They
are very similar to those from the Clovis and Lindenmeier sites.
Mr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., says that gravers are found in material from along the Columbia River, and in Alaska.
localities they semn to be much later than Folsom.7

In those

The distribution of the graver extends over much of the western
portion of the United States and into Canada and Alaska. We find
gravers in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska,
Wyoming, and California.

The lack of information from other states

does. not necessarily mean that gravers do not exist there, but (hat
they may have been overlooked or not reported. In fact, it is reasonable to assmne that gravers are present in Arizona, Utah,
Nevada, Kansas, and Montana, since they lie between states iu which
gravers have been found.

The graver has a fairly wide distribution

and seemingly covers the known vertical range of man in the Southwest.

The graver is definitely associated with artifacts which exhibit the
greatest degree of perfection in flint chipping found in the New
World.

This would seem to indicate the development of an artistic

sense, especially of proportion and symmetry. ]t is logical to
sume that the gravers found with these cultures were. used for engraving.

We kuow that European aborigines were familiar with

engraving, and although we had aborigines in the Southwest who
equaled or even surpassed them in the art of chipping and working
with flint, they still are not given credit, by some, with having
knowledge of the art o[ engraving. It is true that we have very few
examples of m~graving, but as ~urther excavation is completed
the Southwest more will undoubtedly be discovered.
The graver was evidently not in rise among the iPueblo Indians of
the Southwest. The only reference, with which the writer is familiar, made to a graver in a Pueblu site is in Dr. A. V. Kidderâs,
Arti]acts oJ Pecos, in which he illustrates and describes one artifact
which he says could probably have been used as a graver, though it
more nearly resembles dm drill or awl.

It is hoped that this paper will have the same effect as the one

Type, D~,v$.ribu~io~n and Occurâfences of Flin~ Gravers

47

published by Dr. J. T. Patterson, of the University of Texas, on
The Corner-Tang Flint .4rti]a.cts o] Texas, in arousing interest in,
and in the securing of additional data on the graver. The cornertang artifacts were relatively unknown until Dr. Patterson published
his paper. Immediately upon its publication additional information
as to distribution and occurrence began to pour in, making it necessary to publish a supplementary paper.
Further study will undoubtedly add more knowledge as to types,
horizons, and distribution of the graver. It is hoped that this
paper will stimulate interest in the graver and serve as an incentive
for further and more comprehensive study.
