ABSTRACT

On November 29 and December 1, 2004 Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
(MAC) conducted a subsurface survey investigation of Root Memorial Square Park at the
request of Kirksey Architect and City of Houston Convention and Entertainment Department.
This request was based on the requirements for Texas Historical Commission (THC)
Antiquities Permit No. 3598. The archeological investigation was carried out under the
supervision of Roger G. Moore and Kelly E. Schexnayder.
The Project Area was located in downtown Houston and is depicted on the USGS
Settegast quadrangle map, 1982 edition (Figure 1). Plans for the park included landscaping
(without disturbing the existing oaks) and installing a basketball court. The focus of the
investigation concerned only the area that was to be the basketball court (Figure 3). The
objective of the subsurface investigation was to confirm or deny the presence of significant
archeological deposits or features within the only deeply-excavated component of the
proposed park improvements.
The only archeological features exposed during the stripping investigation were a
series of piers from the Root Home, an 1880s construction. No artifacts were recovered from
the project area. The THC concurred with results of the Interim Report that no historic
properties were affected and that the project may proceed (Figure 2). Therefore, further
cultural resource field investigations were not recommended for Root Memorial Square Park.

Introduction

On November 29 and December 1, 2004 Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
(MAC) conducted a subsurface survey investigation of Root Memorial Square Park at the
request of Kirksey Architect and City of Houston Convention and Entertainment Department.
This request was based on the requirements for Texas Historical Commission (THC)
Antiquities Permit No. 3598. The archeological investigation was carried out under the
supervision of Roger G. Moore and Kelly E. Schexnayder. The Project Area was located in
downtown Houston and is depicted on the USGS Settegast quadrangle map, 1982 edition
(Figure 1). Plans for the park included landscaping (without disturbing the existing oaks)
and installing a basketball court. The focus of the investigation concerned only the area that
was to be the basketball court (Figure 2). The objective of the subsurface investigation was
to confirm or deny the presence of significant archeological deposits or features within the
only deeply-excavated component of the proposed park improvements.
Prior to the investigation, site records on file at the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) as well as the MAC compilation of archeologically surveyed areas were
examined to determine whether previously recorded sites existed in or adjacent to the entire
Project Area. This review also included sites that may have been listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks. There were no previously
recorded sites.
The report to follow provides a greater detail for environmental background, descriptions,
interpretations, and recommendations. Report sections first address the project area context
and urban archeology in southeast Texas.

The research design and methods are then

introduced followed by the results of the investigation and recommendations for the project.

I. PROJECT AREA CONTEXT

Physical Setting
The project area is located in downtown Houston on the northeast corner of Block
313, which is designated as Root Memorial Square Park. The park is bounded by Clay,
LaBranch, Bell, and Austin Streets. Directly east of the park is the Toyota Center. At the
time of the investigation the park consisted of live oak trees, flat open green space, and
paved walkways.

General Historical Context

Named after Sam Houston, the townsite of Houston was staked in 1836 by its
founders, Augustus C. and John K. Allen. A factor in choosing this site was its location at the
head of the tide of Buffalo Bayou, which provided a point where goods could be transferred
from one form of transport to another, i.e. from steamboat to ox-wagon. The site was platted
by surveyors in a gridiron fashion with streets running parallel and perpendicular to the
bayou. This was not necessarily done for the sake of beauty or order but for the efficient ease
it provided commercial purposes. Houston was pushed as the perfect place for the
government seat, promoted as âhealthy, beautiful, plentiful in food and natural resources, and
in an advantageous location for Texas and for the communication with the United Statesâ
(McComb 1981:14). The promoters won their rally and Houston became the seat of the
Republic of Texas on November 30, 1836. The first arrivals came in early 1837, many of
them aboard the Laura, thought to be the first steamer to penetrate the bayou above
Harrisburg and reach the townsite. However, it did not take long for the reality of the
environmental conditions to prove too miserable for most and the government seat moved to
Austin in 1840.
After the relocation of the government seat, Houston focused on itself as a trade place
with a lesser emphasis on manufacture (McComb 1981: 14-17). The demands of trade along
with the presence of local manufacturing inspired the formation of the transportation network
of roads, the ship channel, and railroads, all of which reached maturity between 1875-1930.

4

It was the development of the latter two during this time which proved to be major elements
of the transportation network. Three other elements of transportation- roadways, air transport,
and pipelines- evolved but did not reach full effectiveness until after 1930 (McComb 1981:
65-70).

With the expectation that the Houston townsite would eventually extend into the
southern prairie, James S. Holman applied for a 1/3 league of land south and adjacent to
the original Houston tract. Surveyed and platted in 1839, each of the blocks in the
northern section of the Holman 1/3 League Survey was divided into 12 lots. To do this a
standard pattern was used whereby the block was split into three long sections running
north to south with each section divided into rectangular lots. The sections to the east and
to the west were each divided into five same-size lots. The center section was divided
into two longer lots, thereby creating a total of 12 lots. The lower part of the Holman 1/3
League Survey was intended for small residential farms and was therefore was divided
into 10 acre âoutlotsâ (Wagner and Moore 2000:9).

Site Ownership on Block 313

Root Memorial Square Park was built to commemorate the blockâs former
landowner, Alexander Porter Root, a prominent businessman in Houston in the late 19th
century. Root was educated at Yale and moved to Houston in 1874 where he established
himself as an officer to the First National Bank (Houghton, et al. 1991:37). He bought
the property in 1882 and began residing on it in 1884. Later, during 1893-94, the grand
estate at 1410 Clay was constructed by architect George Dickey, which took up the entire
city block. The house was later demolished in 1925. It is not known whether the earlier
house was demolished or incorporated into the later one (ibid: 131).

II. URBAN ARCHEOLOGY IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS

Urban Site Formation in Houston, Texas
Excerpt from paper presented by Roger G. Moore at Texas Archeological Society
Meeting, 2000, Galveston

Extensive exposure to urban site formation and alteration processes have
suggested that a handful of dominant stratigraphic contexts can be defined which
combine to represent most of what you can expect to see when you get below the
surface in a central business district. The following are the various types of
stratigraphic contexts:

Accretional contexts - artificial deposition of successive, often relatively thin fills
resulting in classic layer-cake stratifications of preserved, successive occupational
surfaces. This is very useful when punctuated by documented events such as fires
or demolitions that can be directly related to specific stratifications.

Sealed contexts - the occupational or primary depositional surfaces wholly or
partly intact and sealed by subsequent construction.

Truncated contexts - the occupational surface and often some of subsoil missing;
this is the most common archeological context to be encountered on urban
investigations.

âBlown awayâ contexts â an absence of in situ deposits due to some combination
of truncation into sterile subsoil and homogenizing mixing of pre-existing
deposits and imported fills, both often containing artifacts. These deposits are
archeologically important mostly in the ability to recognize such contexts and not
expend unnecessary time.

6

Non-archeological contexts - which are essentially âmade landsâ to a depth far
exceeding practical or justifiable archeological investigations such as artificially
filled stream channel deposits.

May contain artifacts from elsewhere and

archeologically important mostly in the ability to recognize such contexts from
both documentary and field data and not waste further time on them.

Related Nineteenth-Century Urban Sites in Texas

Other important cultural resource investigations pertaining to nineteenth-century
urban sites have been conducted throughout Texas. A few of the more significant ones
will be discussed here for comparative purposes, beginning with the most recent.
In 2001 MAC conducted a subsurface survey for the Toyota Center in downtown
Houston. Twenty three features were identified within the six-block Project Area which
th

th

yielded a mixed temporal component of late 19 century to early 20 century artifacts.
Among thee features were brick cisterns, a privy, a brick well, and refuse deposits.
Although no site numbers were assigned to the Project Area, many of the brick features
were probably constructed prior to 1870 thereby contributing valuable information to the
archeological record (Schexnayder 2007).
Another significant urban study in the area was Minute Maid Park (41HR812,
41HR815, 41HR816, and 41HR818-823), conducted during 1997-1998 by MAC. The
project took place in downtown Houston and uncovered remnants of one of Houstonâs
th

earliest residential neighborhoods dating from the middle 19 century. Funded by the
Houston Sports Authority (HSA), the investigations covered 17 city blocks and resulted
in the identification of more than 200 features. Of these features, 103 were excavated
resulting in 80 being identified as pre-1870. Brick cisterns, wells, and house foundations
were examined as well as wood-lined privies and scattered refuse deposits. Nearly 30,
000 artifacts were recovered which reflect the middle class status of the residents
(Carlson 2001).
Yet another major nineteenth-century excavation in Texas is the townsite of old
Velasco (41BO125) at the original mouth of the Brazos River in Brazoria County.

7

Performed by Prewitt and Associates, the fieldwork took place in August-October 1992
and January 1993. The project was initiated when features of the townsite were exposed
by erosion of the channel after dredging. Archeological testing involved trenching and
stripping which revealed 476 features consisting of postholes, building foundations, privy
pits and other remains of waterfront blocks dating between 1833-1842, essentially the
short life span of the town. The artifact assemblage consists of diagnostic ceramics,
container glass, and glass tablewares which provide a rich interpretation of frontier Texas
life in a townsite (Earls et al. 1996).
In the 1980s an archeological investigation was undertaken at Ashton Villa House
Museum (41GV65) in Galveston, Texas.

Ashton Villa was the nineteenth-century

residence of prominent Galvestonian James Moreau Brown.

Rice University, in

conjunction with the Houston Archeological Society and the Galveston Historical
Foundation (GHF), initiated a project which examined the relationship between the urban
residential landscape and the ideology creating it (Anderson 1985; Anderson and Moore
1988; Moore and Anderson 1984).

Architectural features were revealed after the

implementation of 11 shovel tests and 11 larger units across the estate grounds. MAC
was asked to revisit the site in 1987 in order to conduct limited data recovery
excavations.

Under the terms of a contract between MAC and GHF, the open pit

excavation simultaneously operated as an interpretive archeological exhibit. The field
investigation, conducted along the south wall of a two-story brick breezeway, resulted in
three interior excavation units and three exterior units. Additional buried architectural
features were revealed, reflecting the Villaâs occupation episodes, which ranged from
1860 to 1906 (Meyers 2000).

III. ARCHEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND FIELD INVESTIGATION
Preliminary Assessment
A previous Archival Research and Archeological Assessment investigation (J. K.
Wagner & Co. 2003) provided dates of initial occupation within the footprint of the proposed
Project Area within Block 313. These occupants were potentially associated with the
archeological features which were targeted for exposure by the subsurface survey program
reported herein.
Significant archeological remains which could potentially have occurred within the
project area fell into two broad classes: (1) prehistoric (i.e., Indian) archeological deposits
and features and, (2) historical-period archeological deposits and features relating to the
settlement and development of the City of Houston. No prehistoric remains were identified
during the subsurface survey stage investigations. The Archival Research and Archeological
Assessment investigation confirmed that the portions of the Project Area had been initially
occupied prior to 1870.
Thus, Block 313 was expected to have potential to contain archeological remains
dating from the earliest years of development of the City of Houston.

Field Methods
The principal investigator conducted a preliminary records search prior to the
field survey. Pertinent cartographic sources were examined and reports on previous
investigations in the area were obtained.
The archeological field investigation was conducted to achieve the following objectives:

1. to locate and inventory, through systematic field investigation, any unrecorded
archeological sites within the project area;
2. to determine the boundaries, depth, fundamental characteristics, and state of
preservation of any identified cultural resource; and
3. to report survey results to Kirksey Architects, City of Houston Convention
and Entertainment Department, and the Texas Historical Commission, and to

10

contribute to the local and regional body of archeological literature on site
typology and distribution, historical land use patterns, and environmental and
geological contexts for prehistoric and historic settlement.

Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. conducted this investigation on November
29 and December 1, 2004. Heavy equipment services for this investigation, in the form
of a trackhoe and operator, were provided by U.S.A. Environmental, Inc., of Houston,
Texas. Only the area of the proposed basketball court, which was to be depressed, was
the exclusive areal focus of this subsurface survey investigation. The area of stripping
investigation measured approximately 16 meters on street grid East-West side x 10
meters on North-South side. MAC first excavated a single 4 m x 1 Â½ m x 80 cm deep
stratigraphic exploratory trench within the investigation area to define the sequence of fill
deposition and depth of natural soil. Achieving these initial stratigraphic objectives, the
crew then commenced the trackhoe stripping excavation, alertly watching for the
exposure of the upper natural soil surface, and any bricks, soil stains, artifact
concentrations, or other anomalies that may indicate the presence of archeological
features or deposits.

The stripping investigation (as well as the previous trench

excavation) was carried out using a trackhoe with a smooth-bladed âcleanoutâ bucket.
This bucket, and the skill of the operator, ensured that the excavation floor was smoothsurfaced in order to reveal any archeological features intrusive into the surrounding,
undisturbed natural soils.

Results and Recommendations

Stratigraphy and archeological content within the investigation area proved to be
very consistent. The stratigraphic profile consisted uniformly of a relatively thin (ca. 2025 cm) zone of disturbed soils overlying undisturbed natural soils to the base of the
excavation (Figure 3). The sole small area of departure from this uniform soil profile was
in the area of an existing storm drain that runs along and defines the southwest edge of
the investigation area. The drainpipe trench was backfilled with clean sand.

11

The only archeological features exposed during the stripping investigation were a
series of piers for the Root Home, an 1880s construction agreed by the Texas Historical
Commission to be too late to be considered significant. These piers consisted of several
preserved courses of high-fired (basically modern) brick overlying an ~ 18 cm thick pier
base pad composed of concrete with broken brick employed as aggregate. MAC has seen
brick used as the aggregate component for concrete in several instances before, all in
association with structures built in the late 19th-or early 20th-centuries.
The tops of the preserved brick course portions of the piers marked the base level
of demolition of the Root home, and hence the base of disturbance associated with this
demolition. All soils above this level (about 25 cm below the current surface) are
disturbed.

Soils below the level of the top of the brick were therefore potentially

undisturbed, unless pierced by other localized excavations such as privy pits or well, etc.
No such evidence of other excavations was seen in the investigation area. Soils between
the piers appeared intact, and showed no signs of these localized disturbances. In order
to insure that we had sufficiently penetrated the natural soil to expose any features
present, we scraped away the upper brick course portions of the piers down to the tops of
the underlying brick pier foundation pads.

This extended the overall depth of the

stripping excavation by at least another 20-30 cm. No change was observed during this
additional excavation and no artifacts were present within the project area.
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. thus recommended that the proposed park
construction be allowed to begin based upon the negative results of the subsurface survey
investigation. The THC concurred with these recommendations in correspondence dated
December 2, 2004 (see Figure 2).
