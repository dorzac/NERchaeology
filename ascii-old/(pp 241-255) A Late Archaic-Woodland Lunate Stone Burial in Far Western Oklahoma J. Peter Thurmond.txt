A Late Archaic/Woodland Lunate Stone Burial in
Far Western Oklahoma
J. Peter Thurmond

ABSTRACT
A dorsally notched lunate stone, a comer-notched dart point, and two bifaces
have been found associated with a prehistoric human burial at the Beaver Dam site
(34 RM208) within the upland canyon of a Washita River tributary in far western
Oklahoma. Lunate stones are quite rare but have been previously documented at
nine sites in a narrow north-south band along the Caprock Escarpment in western
Texas. These artifacts consistently are found in Late Archaic/Woodland contexts
and probably date between 1000 B.C and A.D. 500. The geographic distribution
of lunate stones in archeological sites along the eastern margin of the Llano
Estacado may delimit the territory of a Late Archaic/Woodland hunter-forager
macroband adapted to this ecotonal environment.

INTRODUCTION

In the fail of 1980, William and Edith Yowell, of Reydon, Oklahoma,
discovered a human burial eroding out of the near-vertical wail of a gully on
Brokenleg Creek in southern Roger Mills County, Oklahoma (Figure 1). The burial
had been preserved up to that time in a narrow remnant of valley fill sandwiched
between the gully and the main Brokenleg canyon. This site was recorded as
34RM208, the Beaver Dam site, in 1983. At the time the burial was discovered, most
of the skeleton had fallen downslope and had been washed downstream. The gully
forms a very narrow, deep defile, and the skeletal material, once displaced, would
have fallen rapidly to the gully floor and been flushed out. The burial, near the top
of the profile, was contained within a thick, darkly melanized epipedon (upper soil
horizon) that has yielded a considerable quantity of Late Archaic/Woodland
habitation debris. Part of this deposit was excavated by the Oklahoma Anthropological
Society in 1988 (Thurmond 1988 a--c).
The burial was near the center of the vertical extent of this epipedon, about 75
cm below the modem surface. Only the right tibia, right humerus, and both scapulae
were still in place. Cranial, vertebral, and rib fragments downslope on the talus were
not collected. It was the Yowellsâ€™ impression that the individual had been buried in
a flexed position, facing east, on a north-south axis. Adjacent to the left scapula, a
single comer-notched dart point and a lunate stone were recovered in situ. Two
bifaces that were found on the talus directly below the burial in a litter of weathered
bone fragments ap~ared to have come from the burial.

DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLECTION

Skeletal Material
All skeletal element measurements follow Bass (1971).
34RM208-197

A human left scapula without the inferior two-thirds of the body, but with most
of the axilliary and superior borders intact; form of scapular notch and vertebral
border not determinable; epiphyses completely fused; no atrophic spots; moderate
osteophytic lipping evident around the border of the glenoid fossa; maximum length
about 16.0 cm; maximum breadth about 11.5 cm; spine length about 14.5 cm;
scapular index 71.875.
34RM208-198
A human right scapula, lacking the inferior half of body and the greater part of
the acromion, but with most of the axilliary and superior borders; form of scapular
notch and vertebral border not determinable; no atrophic spots; moderate osteophytic lipping about the border of the glenoid fossa; maximum length about 16.0
cm; maximum breadth 11.5 cm; spine length about 14.5 cm; scapular index 70.968;

both this scapula and No. 324RM208-197 suggest an adult male between 35 and 45
years of age, suffering from a moderate case of degenerative arthritis.
34RM208-199

A complete human tibia; epiphyses are entirely fused; localized but fairly
severe postmortem damage to the margins of the epiphyses; the medial maUeolus
is missing. It is impossible to determine if there was osteophytic lipping over most
of the epiphyses, but small areas of pronounced arthritic lipping are preserved on
the posterior side of the medial condyle and about the intercondyloid eminence. The
locations of the postmortem damage around the margins of the epiphyses suggest
weakening of the bone, probably also due to degenerative arthritis. There is
substantial scarring of the bone tissue at all muscle attachment points, indicating
robust musculature. Maximum length 37.4 cm; anterior-posterior diameter at the
nutrient foramen 4.1 cm; transverse diameter at the nutrient foramen 2.6 cm;
platycnemic index 63.42 (mesocnemic); data suggest an adult male over 18 but
presenilic; estimated stature 191-197 cm (following Trotter and Gleser 1952,
1958).
34RM208-200

A complete human fight humerus; epiphyses entirely fused; some minor
postmortem damage about the margins of trochlea, olecranon fossa, and head; all
muscle attachment points strongly pronounced, indicating very substantial musculature; moderate osteophytic lipping apparent about the margins of head, trochlea,
and capitulum; septal aperture absent; maximum length 31.8 cm; epicondylar width
5.9 cm; maximum midshaft diameter 2.6 cm; minimum midshaft diameter 1.8 cm;
maximum vertical head diameter 4.6 cm; transverse head diameter 4.4 cm; least
diaphysis circumference 7.3 cm; robusticity index 22.956; specimen is definitely an
adult, but its characteristics are equivocal as to sex. The dimensions of the head,
maximum length, and epicondylar width are all intermediate between the male and
female means; the absence of a septal aperture and the presence of pronounced
muscle attachments argue for a male between 20 and 45; evidence of degenerative
arthritis suggests the upper end of that range.
Chipped Stone Tools
34RM208-1026 (Figure 2)
A medium-sized comer-notched dart point, referrable to the Marcos type,
knapped from a flake of brown-and-gray silicified wood of quite varied silification.
The marginal quality of the material caused problems with the final thinning and
shaping of the point. The blade is large and triangular, but asymmetrical, with
strongly convex lateral edges and a fairly blunt tip. There is a pronounced barb on
one shoulder but none on the other side. The stem is short, wide, and strongly
expanding, with a convex base. One basal comer has been lost to postmanufacture

damage. The specimen is biconvex in cross section. Overall length 56 mm; blade
length 45 mm; stem length 11 mm, maximum stem width at basal corners 21mm
(estimated); minimum stem width at blade/stem juncture 15 mm; maximum
thickness 10 mm; tip angle 41 degrees; blade angle 66 degrees; haft angle 90
degrees; weight 11.8 g. All measurements follow Gunn and Prewitt (1974). The
asymmetry of the blade gives the initial impression ofa hafted knife, but there is no
visible edge damage or wear on the blade edges.
34RM208-I027 0~igure 3, A)
A poorly thinned biface of medium gray Ogallala quartzite (sometimes called
Potter chert by northwest Texans) of mediocre knappability. The specimen has an
elongated, fairly symmetrical ovaloid outline, biconvex transverse cross section
and gently curved longitudinal cross section. It was obviously made from a long,
narrow flake. There are several unreduced nocks bordered by hinge fractures on
both faces. The edges are rather sinuous and have no discernible damage or wear
from use, but this is very hard material. Length 94 mm; maximum width 32 mm;
maximum thickness 11 mm; weight 35.5 g.

Another poorly thinned biface, knapped from a cobble of dark brownish gray
silicified wood of advanced silicification but poor homogeneity. Although
recognizably ovaloid in outline, the shape is quite asymmetrical, with one lateral
edge strongly convex and the other nearly straight. The asymmetry may have been
unintentional, since the knapper had a lot of trouble with the straight edge, which
is bordered by a continuous line of hinge fractures and a ridge ofunreduced material.
The biface is biconvex in cross section; the lateral edges are fairly straight, but there
is no discemible wear or damage; length 86 mm; maximum width 42 mm; maximum
thickness 15 mm; weight 53.0 g.

Lunate Stone
34RM208-1025 (Figure 4, A-C)

A polished stone object of the form that has alternatively been referred to as a
"cariniform atlatl weight" (Parsons, Hill, and Parker 1979) and a "lunate stone"
(Redding and Parker 1991). The latter term is preferred, due to its lack of any
functional assumption and its more common usage. The specimen has an elongated
planoconvex outline, with the base curving up slightly at each end. In cross section
the base is flat, and both faces are symmetrically convex, curving up to a rounded
top. Length 90 mm; maximum height 30 mm; maximum thickness 19 mm; weight
76.5 g.
Twenty-two notches have been cut into the dorsal (convex) edge. The notches
are narrow and V shaped, and appear to have been cut into the surface by the sawing
motion of a narrow cutting tool (flakes of Ogalalla quartzite would probably serve
the purpose). The grooves average 2 mm in span at the top, narrow to a point at their
floors, and average 1 mm in depth.
The notch at the apex of the convex edge is much larger than the others, some
4 mm across at the top, and has a more rounded U-shaped cross section. Deeper than
the others, it is cut nearly 2 mm into the surface. A transverse groove 4 mm wide and
1 mm deep extends down both faces of the artifact from this notch to the base.
Although the notch does not extend onto the base, there is a visible worn area some
5--6 mm wide running transversely across the center of the base. The entire exterior
surface is well polished except for the floors of the notches cut into the dorsal edge.
It is apparent that the transverse groove is polished and grades into the surfaces on
both sides except at the apex of the dorsal edge, where its floor and sides are rough
and unpolished.
Interestingly, this lunate stone was manufactured from the yellowish brown
fossiliferous shale that is common in local lag gravels derived from the Ogalalla
Formation. This shale was also used by Late Prehistoric groups in the vicinity to
temper their pottery (Moore 1984:61). The ferruginous shale is packed with
fragmented Texigryphaea fossils. S imilar material is available on the surface within
100 meters of 34RM208.
DISCUSSION

The distribution of dorsally notched lunate stones like the one from the Beaver
Dam site appears to be limited to the vicinity of the Caprock Escarpment on the east
side of the Llano Estacado, south of the Canadian River and mostly north of the
Colorado River (Figure 5). Although there was a dubious surface association of a
HarreU arrowpoint with a lunate stone at the Old Tom Burial (41DK16) in Dickens
County, Texas (Parsons, Hill and Parker 1979:72), lunate stones generally appear
to be associated with corner- and side-notched dart points of the Marcos, Marshall,
and Ensor types---especially the last--(ibid.:79; Redding and Parker 1991). Lunate
stones usually are found in areas where sites with these dart points are predominant

(ibid.). This is certainly the case for 34RM208, since 55 percent of the components
in its vicinity are Late Archaic/Woodland (Thurmond In press).
It is tempting to assume that sites in northwest Texas and far western Oklahoma
that yield only Marcos, Marshall, and Ensor dart points in the absence of pottery and
arrowpoints are of Late Archaic age (cf. D. Hughes 1977, 1984, 1989; J. Hughes
1988; Leonhardy 1966; Thurmond In press), but the radiocarbon dates from the
region belie this assumption. Both sites yielding comer- and side-notched dart
points and those yielding comer- and basally notched arrowpoints and early pottery
seem to date to about the same time span (Tables 1, 2, 3). Estabhshment of a solid
chronology for the region has barely begun. Nonetheless, it appears that sites
yielding lunate stones are of Late Archaic/Woodland age (the author does not
believe the two are clearly separable at present) and probably date somewhere
between 1~ B.C. and A.D. 500.
The lunate stone from Beaver Dam differs from the northwest Texas examples
in two respects. The Texas specimens are as a rule manufactured from exotic
materials, particularly from a metamorphic greenstone of undetermined origin
(Parsons, Hill, and Parker 1979; Redding and Parker 1991), but, by contrast, the
lunate stone from 34RM208 was made from material that was available within
crawling distance of the site. The Texas specimens that have been reported also tend
to be quite narrow and distinctly triangular in cross section, whereas the lunate stone
from Beaver Dam is much wider than the Texas specimens and has a more rounded
cross section.
The author, in all honesty, has no clue as to what these artifacts were used for.
Parsons, Hill, and Parker (1979) lean towards atlatl weights; Redding and Parker
prefer to interpret them as decorative pendants (1991). In two replicative experiments Howard (1974) found atlatl weights functionally counterproductive, but
Dickson (1985) beheves the jury is out on whether the addition of weights could
improve atlatl performance. We know weights were attached to atlatls by some
Amerindian groups, since examples have been recovered from dry caves in the
Southwest (Guernsey 1931; Fenenga and Wheat 1940; Hester 1974; Mildner 1974).
Whatever their specific use, lunate stones were clearly deemed important by
their makers, since, in this environment where most artifacts are quite utilitarian,
considerable time must have been invested in the production of these objects of
beauty. Keeping in mind the very restricted geographic range of lunate stones, the
author believes they may serve as a a useful cultural marker. It is quite possible that
all lunate stones were made by a single sociocultural group adapted to the margin
of the High Plains over a limited span of time. We badly need some radiocarbon
dates from solid associations with lunate stones, and the author is considering
sacrificing some of the skeletal material from 34RM208 to try for a bone date after
first obtaining a chemical analysis of the bone to determine its degree of weathering
in order to assess the reliability of any radiocarbon assay.
Lunate stones are interesting in their own right as both rare prehistoric artifacts
and art objects. They may also have considerable interpretive value in our attempts
to understand Late Archaic/Woodland chronology and social group boundaries.
