The environmental review, consultation, and other actions required by applicable Federal environmental laws for this
project are being, or have been, carried-out by TxDOT pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 327 and a Memorandum of Understanding
dated 12-16-14, and executed by FHWA and TxDOT.

Abstract
In June 2015, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC., of Houston, Texas, at the request of HNTB
Corporation, conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations within
approximately 24 kilometers (14.7 miles) of property proposed for the expansion of the
State Highway 36 corridor between Highway 90 and Farm-to-Market Road 1952 in Fort
Bend and Austin Counties, Texas. The Texas Department of Transportation has been
identified as the Lead Agency for this project. Work for this project will be completed as part
of the Texas Department of Transportation Project CSJ Numbers 0187-05-049 and 018704-029 by the Houston and Yoakum Districts.
The goals of the survey were to determine if the initiation of this project would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not
previously unidentified archaeological resources were located within the project’s Area of
Potential Effects. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to
state (Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended [36 CFR 800]) guidelines, and according to standards set forth by the Texas
Department of Transportation Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects. All
research and reporting for this project was completed with reference to Texas Department of
Transportation’s current Standards of Uniformity for Technical Reports with regard to Review
Standards for Archaeological Survey and Reporting (Texas Department of Transportation
2011; version 3).
The Area of Potential Effects for this project is defined as the project length, the existing and
proposed right-of-way, and the depth of construction impacts, composed of a total of 123.5
hectares (305.2 acres). Of this, the existing right-of-way subsumes a total of 107 hectares
(264 acres), while new proposed right-of-way will comprise the remaining 16.7 hectares
(41.20 acres). The total area to be subjected to archaeological survey within the Area of
Potential Effects is 16.7 hectares (41.20 acres), comprised of all property proposed as new
right-of-way on the south side of State Highway 36. Of the 16.7 hectares (41.20 acres) of
new right-of-way, right-of-entry was not provided for approximately 10.8 hectares (26.8
acres). These parcels were subjected to a desktop assessment. Although the depth of
impact is unknown, belowground impacts are expected to be typical of road construction
activities, impacting up to 1 meter (3 feet) below natural grade. The Area of Potential Effects
depth may extend to culturally sterile depths across the project right-of-way. More often the
project will entail the building up of material from the existing ground surface. No deep
impacts are anticipated within the project area.
The intensive pedestrian and reconnaissance surveys completed for the service areas
discussed in this report took place on easements belonging to the Texas Department of
Transportation and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was obtained by the client for
privately owned land. Work conducted to complete this survey was conducted under Texas

Antiquities Permit number 6609, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s Division of
Archeology in July 2013
No new or previously identified archaeological sites were recorded during the investigation.
Testing results displayed soil profiles indicative of those that are mapped for the area and
gave no indication of buried cultural horizons within the proposed depth of the Area of
Potential Effects. Based on the negative results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray
& Pape, LLC. recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as
planned.

Project Description
Project Type: State Highway 36 Expansion
Total Project Impact Acreage: 305.2 acres
New Right of Way (ROW) Acreage: 41.20 acres
Easement Acreage: 41.20 acres
Area of Pedestrian Survey: 41.20 acres
Project Description and Impacts: The project area is located on the Richmond (#2995-321),
Orchard (#2995-322), East Bernard (#2996-411) and Wallis (#2996-414) United States
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 1). The project
begins in Wallis, Texas at the junction of Farm-to-Market (FM) road 1952 and SH 36 in
Austin County and proceeds east along SH 36, to the town of Rosenberg, Texas, ending at
the junction with Highway 90.
The existing SH 36 alignment will be expanded from a 2-lane undivided roadway to a 4-lane
divided rural roadway. A 2-way center left turn lane median is proposed throughout the
length of the proposed project. Total project length is approximately 24 kilometers (14.7
miles). The existing right-of-way (ROW) has a usual width of 29 to 45 meters (95 to 150 feet)
and an additional 25.6 to 60 meters (85 to 200 feet) of proposed usual ROW. The amount
of proposed ROW acquisition is approximately 16.7 hectares (41.20 acres). The Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad tracks are present on the north side of SH 36 along the
entire project length and therefore, alternatives would be limited to one build alternative on
the south side of SH 36 and the no-build alternative. Refer to Appendix A for detailed project
schematics (Figure 1).
Area of Potential Effects (APE): The APE for this project is defined as the project length, the
existing and proposed ROW, and the depth of construction impacts, composed of a total of
123.5 hectares (305.2 acres). Of this, the existing ROW subsumes a total of 107 hectares
(264 acres), while new proposed ROW will comprise the remaining 16.7 hectares (41.20
acres). The total area to be subjected to archaeological survey within the APE is 16.7
hectares (41.20 acres), comprised of all property proposed as new ROW on the south side of
State Highway 36. Of the 16.7 hectares (41.20 acres) of new ROW, right-of-entry was not
provided for approximately 10.8 hectares (26.8 acres). These parcels were subjected to a
desktop assessment. Although the depth of impact is unknown, belowground impacts are
expected to be typical of road construction activities, impacting up to 1 meter (3 feet) below
natural grade. The APE depth may extend to culturally sterile depths across the project ROW.
More often the project will entail the building up of material from the existing ground
surface. No deep impacts are anticipated within the project area.

Project Area Ownership: The intensive pedestrian and reconnaissance surveys completed
for the service areas discussed in this report took place on easements belonging to the
Texas Department of Transportation and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was
obtained by the client for privately owned land.

Project Setting
Topography: The APE is situated in the relatively flat and low-lying coastal flood plains of the
Brazos River.
Geology: The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low level
to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches
as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma and as far west as the Balcones escarpment
in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and
associated inland areas, which includes Fort Bend and Austin Counties, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial
advance in the northern portions of the continent and subsequent downcutting and
variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, both counties are
underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in
age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Soils: A review of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Web Soil Survey
revealed that the project area is composed primarily Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes, Bernard-Edna complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes, Bernard clay loams, 0 to 1 percent
slopes, Edna fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and Katy fine sandy loam, 0 to 1
percent slopes (Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service [SSS NRCS],
USDA 2015).
Lake Charles clay soils (0 to 1 percent slope) have formed in clayey, late Pleistocene,
fluvialmarine deposits. Lake Charles clay is typically 2 meters (80 inches) or more deep clay
above the water table (SSS NRCS USDA 2015). These soils form on flat stream terraces that
rarely flood. They are characterized as somewhat poorly drained and have slow to very slow
permeability. These soils have a high shrink-swell potential mainly due to the considerable
and lasting wetness. This clay is very sticky and becomes progressively blocky with depth.
The first 30 to 127 centimeters (12 to 50 inches) of Lake Charles series clay is typically dark
gray (10YR 4/1), which may be mottled with small amounts of brown or yellow clay (10YR
5/4 or 2.5Y 4/4). From 127 to 163 centimeters (50 to 64 inches), Lake Charles series soil
can be a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray clay (10YR 5/1), or a light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2)
that is increasingly mottled with yellowish to olive brown clay (2.5Y 5/4). At a depth of 229
to 262 centimeters (90 to 103 inches), Lake Charles series clay is mottled yellowish red
(5YR 5/6) and gray (10YR 6/1) with brownish yellow mottles (10YR 6/6) (SSS NRCS USDA
2015). These soils generally have a low potential to produce intact deeply buried resources
(Abbott 2001).

Bernard-Edna complex (Be) is a mix of mainly Bernard clay loam and Edna fine sand
(Mowery at al. 1960). The Bernard soil is found in flat and depressed areas while the Edna
soil is found on ridges, knolls and pimple mounds. The surface layer of the Bernard clay
loam is very dark gray clay loam about 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick. Below this is a layer
about 122 centimeters (48 inches) thick with the upper portion being very dark gray clay
and the lower portion being dark gray clay. This layer is followed by gray clay with yellowish
brown mottles and calcium carbonate concretions. The surface layer of the Edna soil is dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam about 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick. Below this is an 86centimeter (34-inch) thick layer of clay with the upper portion being gray and the lower
portion being olive gray. This layer is followed by gray sandy clay loam with yellowish brown
mottles. These soils possess a low potential for archaeological remains (Abbott 2001:22,
23).
In general, Bernard clay loams, 0 to 1 percent slopes are composed of a surface layer of
very dark gray to dark gray clay loam 15.24 centimeters (6 inches) thick. This is followed by
a layer of very hard, very dark gray clay with a few iron-manganese concretions to a depth of
55.88 centimeters (22 inches). After this is a layer of extremely hard, very dark gray clay to a
depth of 88.9 centimeters (35 inches). Beyond that is a layer of dark gray clay with a few
yellowish brown and strong brown mottles and a few iron-manganese concretions to a depth
of 127 centimeters (50 inches). Next, is a layer of grayish brown clay mottled with yellowish
brown spots and includes a few iron-manganese and calcium carbonate concretions to a
depth of 152.4 centimeters (60 inches). Below that is a layer of strong brown sandy clay
loam to a depth of 228.6 centimeters (90 inches) (Mowery et al. 1960; SSS NRCS USDA
2015). These soils generally have a low potential to produce intact deeply buried resources
(Abbott 2001).
In general, Edna loams typically consist of a surface layer of dark gray to grayish brown fine
sandy loam 22.86 centimeters (9 inches) thick. This is followed by a layer with an upper
portion of gray clay mottled with dark gray and grayish brown iron depletions, yellowish
brown iron concentrations, and few dark brown to black iron-manganese concentrations to a
depth of 48.26 centimeters (19 inches). The middle portion consists of light gray clay with
light olive gray iron depletions, faint olive iron and dark brown to black iron-manganese
concentrations to a depth of 96.52 centimeters (38 inches). The lower portion of the layer
entails mottled light brownish gray and light yellowish brown clay loam with few dark brown
and black iron-manganese concretions to a depth of 127 centimeters (50 inches). This is
followed by a layer of light olive gray sandy clay loam including a few olive iron and ironmanganese concretions to a depth of 165 centimeters (65 inches) (SSS NRCS USDA 2015).
These soils generally have a low potential to produce intact deeply buried resources (Abbott
2001).
Katy fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, has a parent material that consists of clayey
alluvium of Holocene age and is found on flood plains on river valleys on coastal plains (SSS
NRCS USDA 2015). It has a surface layer of fine sandy loam to a depth of 61 centimeters

(24 inches). Next is a layer of loam to 107 centimeters (42 inches) and below that is clay
loam to 203 centimeters (80 inches). This soil generally has a low potential to produce
intact deeply buried resources. According to Abbott (2001: Table 2) these soils all typically
have a low geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried
cultural material in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:20).
Land Use: The project begins in Wallis, Texas at the junction of FM road 1952 and State
Highway 36 in Austin County and proceeds east along State Highway 36, to the town of
Rosenberg, Texas, ending at the junction with Highway 90. The current conditions of the APE
consist of mostly agricultural fields and open pasture. Portions of the highway that pass
urban areas have experienced some development including private residences and
businesses. The project area does not cross any major or minor natural waterways.
Vegetation: The existing ROW is covered by short to medium grasses, forbs, oak trees and
corn.
Estimated Ground Surface Visibility: 25 percent
Previous Investigations and Known Archeological Sites: A total of 6 previously recorded
cultural resources investigations have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius
of the project area. In 1977, an area survey was conducted east of the project area for SCS.
No other information is known regarding this survey. In 1994, under TAC Permit Number
1418, an area survey was conducted by BC & AD Archaeology, Inc. east of the project area
in Rosenberg, Texas. No other information is known regarding this survey. In 1984, a linear
survey was conducted along a majority of the current project area by the TDH. No other
information is known regarding this survey. In 1988, the United States Bureau of Land
Management and the American Association of Professional Landmen conducted a linear
survey that runs through the western portion of the project area. No other information is
known regarding this survey.
In 2008, HRA Gray & Pape conducted a cultural resources probability assessment of
approximately 5,665 hectares (14,000 acres) of privately-owned land proposed for
development in Waller, Fort Bend, and Austin Counties, Texas, northwest of and within the
project area. As a result of the desktop assessment, HRA Gray & Pape proposed a plan for
intensive archaeological survey and testing of a representative sample of the project areas
that would focus on areas most likely to contain archaeological sites and features, and also
that would provide maximum coverage of the project area (McIntosh 2008). A part of this
survey crosses into the western side of the project area in Austin County. HRA Gray & Pape
did not designate this area as a high potential area to contain archeological sites.

Survey Methods
Surveyors: Charles E. Bludau, Jr. and Jacob Hilton
Methodological Description: Archaeological methods utilized during the survey consisted of
shovel testing, photo-documentation, and pedestrian reconnaissance. Horizontal control

was maintained by the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS) data collector. All actions
performed, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey actions were
recorded on a shovel test form. These forms included information on provenience, survey
method, and cultural materials identified.
The land parcels defined in the APE for the Fort Bend County portion of the SH 36 Expansion
project crosses PALM units 2, 2a, and 4 (Figure 2, Appendix B). In general, the most
appropriate type of survey method for this project is shovel testing, visual reconnaissance,
and no survey recommended. Likewise, areas mapped as Map Unit 4 were surveyed less
intensively where disturbances were obvious, such as developed land. A single transect was
systematically subjected to shovel testing and/or visual pedestrian survey methods.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and were excavated
to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally
sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter
(0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (2005) soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils
encountered and a profile drawing of the exposed profiles were recorded on a shovel test
form for each excavation.
In general, the presence of mixed textures and colors encountered during shovel testing
suggests that the majority of the APE has been previously disturbed at shallow depths,
almost certainly from previous SH 36 road construction, agricultural practices, and utility
construction project and can be seen in representative photographs (Figures 3 through 7:
Photos D, F, G, J, and K).
Cultural resources, if located, were to be defined according to THC standards as referenced
in 13 TAC 26.20 of the Antiquities Code of Texas, as amended (THC 1969, amended 1997).
However, no artifacts, historic or prehistoric, were recovered during these field
investigations. Therefore, site definition and laboratory methods are not included in this
report.

Comments on Methods: A cultural resources assessment and background research of
parcels where right-of-entry was not permitted indicated that these parcels have been
excessively disturbed due to various forms of land modifications. These areas covered a
total of approximately 10.8 hectares (26.8 acres) of the total project APE (depicted as red
shaded parcels on Figures 3 through 8). Forms of disturbance in these parcels included
agricultural practices, buried utility lines and telephone lines, and artificial drainage ditches
and were photographed from the road (Figures 3 through 8: Photos A, B, E, H, I, and L
through S). The soils in these parcels are considered to be of low geoarchaeological
potential for containing intact deposits (Abbott 2001: 22-23). Additionally, based on the
results from shovel testing in areas where access was granted, it is unlikely that previously
unrecorded cultural resources would be encountered, thus no survey is recommended for
the inaccessible parcels.

Survey Results
Project Area Description: A total of 42 shovel tests were successfully excavated within the
project APE, primarily within proposed ROW in Fort Bend County, composed of 16.7 hectares
(41.20 acres) of new ROW (Figures 3 through 8). In general, the presence of mixed textures
and colors encountered during shovel testing suggests that the majority of the APE has been
previously disturbed at shallow depths, almost certainly from previous SH 36 road
construction, agricultural practices, and utility construction project and can be seen in
representative photographs (Figures 3 through 7: Photos D, F, G, J, and K).
All shovel tests were negative for the presence of archaeological materials. The depth of
shovel test excavation ranged between a minimum of 30 centimeters (16 inches) to a
maximum of 100 centimeters (39 inches). In general, shovel tests within the western portion
of the APE in Fort Bend County were excavated to an average depth of 50 centimeters (20
inches). Typical tests (J05) in this portion of the APE contained very dark gray (10YR 3/1)
clay loam from the ground surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches) followed by very
dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay down to 50 centimeters (20 inches) below ground surface (Figure
9). Typical shovel tests (J25) within the central portion of the APE were excavated to an
average depth of 60 centimeters (24 inches) and contained dark yellowish brown (10YR4/4)
sandy loam from the ground surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches) followed by
brown (10YR4/3) sandy loam down to a depth of 40 centimeters (16 inches). This was
followed by a brown (10YR4/3) mottled with a strong brown (7.5YR5/6) sandy clay down to
a depth of 60 centimeters (24 inches) (Figure 9). A typical shovel test (J37) within the
western portion of the APE contains black (10YR2/1) clay from the surface to a depth of 60
centimeters (24 inches) (Figure 9).
Walk-over survey and the judgmentally placed shovel tests within areas of obvious
disturbance including the presence of drainage ditches, berms, and paved roads also
proved negative for surface exposure of artifacts or buried artifacts (Figures 3 through 8).
Reconnaissance-level pedestrian walkover survey was conducted over 16.7 hectares (41.20
acres) of new ROW. No exposed archaeological resources were observed as a result of the

walkover survey. The BNSF Railroad is located running parallel with SH 36 and was not
subjected to intensive pedestrian survey (Figure 3: Photo D).
Archeological Materials Identified: Other than modern roadside trash observed on the
surface within the APE, no historic-age or prehistoric cultural materials were observed on the
modern ground surface or within any of shovel tests excavated in the APE.

Recommendations
APE Integrity: The majority of the APE has been previously disturbed at shallow depths from
previous SH 36 road construction, artificial drainage ditches, agricultural practices and
above and below ground utility construction projects.
Further Work: No further work is recommended within the APE.
Justification: Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site file search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current proposed project.
These activities did not result in the identification of recorded archaeological historic
properties (sites) within the APE as defined in Section 1.1. There are 3 previously recorded
archaeological sites (41FB1, 41AU48, and 41AU49) within the study radius, although
limited information concerning each was available on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas.
A total of 42 shovel tests were successfully excavated within the project APE, primarily within
proposed ROW in Fort Bend County, composed of 16.7 hectares (41.20 acres) of new ROW.
In general, the presence of mixed textures and colors encountered during shovel testing
suggests that the majority of the APE has been previously disturbed at shallow depths from
previous SH 36 road construction, agricultural practices, and utility construction projects. All
shovel tests were negative for the presence of archaeological materials.
A cultural resources assessment and background research of parcels where right-of-entry
was not permitted indicated that these parcels have been excessively disturbed do to
various forms of land modifications totaling approximately 10.8 hectares (26.8 acres) of the
total project APE. Forms of disturbance in these parcels included agricultural practices,
buried utility lines and telephone lines, and artificial drainage ditches. The soils in these
parcels are considered to be of low geoarchaeological potential for containing intact
deposits (Abbott 2001: 22-23). Additionally, based on the results from shovel testing in
areas where access was granted, it is unlikely that previously unrecorded cultural resources
would be encountered, thus no survey is recommended for the inaccessible parcels.
Based on the results of this investigation, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no additional
investigations be required within the parcels assessed or surveyed under Permit 6609 for
SH 36 Expansion project in Austin and Fort Bend Counties, Texas. The result of survey within
the project area, with regard to 36 CFR 800, falls under section § 800.4(d.1): No historic
properties affected. HRA Gray & Pape also recommends that further work is not required for

those parcels where right-of-entry was not received, and that the project be allowed to
proceed as planned. Should project plans change or additional details become available
that indicate the need for additional survey, HRA Gray & Pape will continue agency
coordination. Should unanticipated finds be encountered during construction, work will stop
in the vicinity of the find and appropriate Agency representatives will be contacted
