ABSTRACT
This report documents the results of an intensive archeological survey carried out in advance of
construction of a proposed U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinic on 14 acres owned by
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas. The survey was conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit No. 8415. Archeologists from
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) visually inspected the entire Area of Potential Effects
(APE) and excavated 7 shovel tests in support of the survey. No new archeological sites were
discovered as a result of the survey and no artifacts were observed within the APE. No artifacts
were collected during this survey, but a field records and photographs were made during
investigations. These records and photographs are to be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. AmaTerra recommends that no further
archeological work is warranted prior to construction.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
On May 8, 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological resource
survey in advance of construction of a proposed outpatient clinic in Lubbock, Texas. The goal of
this survey was to identify and define any archeological resources that could be impacted by the
construction of the clinic. As the project proponent, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
will construct the clinic on land to be leased from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center
(TTUHSC), the land owner. Because the undertaking is located on land owned by TTUHSC, a
state-owned university, the archaeological investigation was regulated pursuant to the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT); work was carried out under TAC Permit 8415. Because the project is
federally funded, the project is also subject to review under the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966. Section 106 of the NHPA directs federal agencies to inventory and assess
properties that could be affected by a federal undertaking.
The proposed VA clinic will be located northwest of 4th Street and Indiana Avenue in the City of
Lubbock (Figure 1). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this undertaking was defined as the
entire proposed 14-acre clinic site to a depth of three feet.
This report is divided into six chapters. The environmental setting and regional cultural overview
are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology
implemented during the project and the results of the archeological field investigations are
discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 consists of the summary and recommendations. The Appendix
contains the log of shovel test results excavated on the property.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is situated within the Llano Estacado section of the High Plains according to the
Level IV Ecoregions Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey. The Llano Estacado
ecoregion is a flat, elevated plain bounded by escarpments to the north, east, and west; its southern
boundary is a more gradual transition zone to the Chihuahaun Deserts (Griffith et al. 2007). The
surface geology in the Llano Estacado ecoregion consists of Pleistocene eolian sediments of the
Blackwater Draw Formation. This lies over Miocene-Pliocene sediments of the Ogallala
Formation that eroded from the eastern Rocky Mountains. A caliche caprock forms the uppermost
layer of the Ogallala Formation. (Griffith et al. 2007). The project location is on an upland surface
with no visible relief west and north of two small basins which have been filled and developed.
Within the project area, windblown Blackwater Draw deposits form the Amarillo series of soils,
which are deep, well drained sandy loams underlain by sandy clay (Figure 2; USDA-NRCS 2018).
As part of the Southern High Plains, Lubbock County has a semi-arid climate, averaging only
18.41 inches of rainfall per year. The average high temperature in the county is 92 degrees
Fahrenheit and the average low is 25 degrees Farenheit, which creates a 208-day growing season
(Graves 2016a). Hundreds of playa lakes dot the region. These small, shallow lakes serve as
important recharge areas for the Ogallala aquifer and as stops for migratory waterfowl. There are
relatively few constant sources of surface water since there are few spring-fed creeks and the
shallow draws usually only flow after heavy rains (Griffith et al. 2007). The closest water source
to the project area is a playa lake located .9 miles to the northwest. Yellow House Draw is 1.7
miles to the northeast. Dams have divided Yellow House Draw into a series of reservoir lakes that
connect to the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River southeast of the City of Lubbock.
The Llano Estacado ecoregion was historically shortgrass prairie consisting of buffalograss
(Bouteloua dactyloides), blue and sideoats grama (Bouteloua gracilis and B. curtipendula,
respectively) and silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides). Millions of bison used to roam the
High Plains. Other native prairie species include black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus),
black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), coyote (Canis
latrans), swift fox (Vulpes velox), deer (Odocoileus spp.), and pronghorn (Antilocarpa americana).
The southern high plains were first used for agriculture in the late nineteenth century; however,
without irrigation, it was not sustainable during droughts. Extensive plowing and overgrazing
along with lack of erosion control led to severe dust storms and soil loss during the drought of the
1930s. Cropland currently makes up approximately 80 percent of this ecoregion with agriculture
being the dominant land use. Primary crops are cotton, corn, sorghum, and wheat (Griffith et al.
2007).

Current Setting
The earliest available aerial photograph from 1954 (Figure 3) shows that the APE was a cotton
field with five-acre residential lots to the east across Indiana Avenue. Evidence from other maps
and aerial photographs suggest that the lot has never been developed or contained structures.
Today, the APE consists of a vacant lot in the northwest corner of 4th Street and Indiana Avenue,
surrounded by mixed residential and medical development to the east, south, and west, and the
Rawls Golf Course to the north.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area is situated within the Llano Estacado archaeological sub region of the Southern
High Plains as defined by Perttula (2004). With few trees, natural shelters, or water sources, the
Llano Estacado has always offered a harsh environment for human occupants. However, rich
animal resources such as bison (Bison bison[JD1]), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), elk (Cervus
canadensis), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have drawn humans to the region for millennia.
Containing several sites with near-continuous human occupations across most of the breadth of
human history in the Americas, the Southern High Plains have a rich, well delineated chronology.
However, well-stratified sites are rare, and when encountered, are of great value for future research
potential.
Four major intervals or periods are identified in the archeological chronology for the Southern
High Plains: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, (which is regionally subdivided into the
Ceramic and Protohistoric) and Historic periods (Perttula 2004). Each of these are briefly
summarized below.

Paleoindian Period
Until recently, it was generally accepted that the first humans in the New World were Clovis
peoples who walked into the continent via the ice-free corridor. It was similarly assumed that
Clovis hunter-gatherers were the first to arrive in Texas around 12,000 years Before Present (BP;
Perttula 2004). But new evidence from sites in North and South America suggests that humans
may have arrived in the Americas as early as 16,000 BP (Gilbert et al. 2008; Jennings and Waters
2014; Pitblado 2011). Evidence from the Debra Friedkin and Gault sites in Central Texas have
brought the date of earliest occupation of Texas into question as well. At both sites lithic artifacts
were found in strata beneath Clovis that indicated a different type of technology was used to
produce them. Optically stimulated luminescence dating from these contexts at both sites
suggested a date of about 15,000 BP (Swaminathan 2014; Gault School 2016).
The Paleoindian period (12,000â8000 BP) on the southern Great Plains is characterized by highly
mobile groups focused on procurement of now-extinct megafauna (large ancestors of modern,
primarily mammal, species such as the mammoth [Mammuthus primigenius], mastodon [Mammut
spp.], and Bison antiquus [Bison antiquus]). The appearance of groundstone tools and remains of
smaller game species during this period indicates a generalized subsistence strategy (Perttula
2004), but an emphasis on hunting large plains game is most conspicuous within the archaeological
record (Holliday 1997). Chronological divisions within the Paleoindian period are based on varied
morphology of lanceolate projectile point forms and include Clovis, Folsom, and the late
Paleoindian period or Plano complex.
Though dates of occupation on the continent may extend to earlier millennia, the earliest, widely
accepted, human presence with defined characteristics in North America occurred about 12,000
years ago (ca. 10,000â9000 BC) and is referred to as the Clovis culture (Holliday 1997).
Although archaeological sites attributable to Clovis are exceptionally rare, this period is well
represented at Blackwater Draw in eastern New Mexico near Clovis, where it was first identified.
The Folsom tradition (ca. 11,000â10,000 BP) follows Clovis and is also well represented at the
Blackwater Draw site, as are several point forms attributable to the Plano complex. A variety of
tool traditions have been attributed to the late Paleoindian period, which extends from about 10,000
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

to 8000 BP. Collectively known as the Plano complex, these traditions are identified by point types
such as Plainview, Meserve, Eden, Angostura, and Scottsbluff. Although these points lack the
longitudinal fluting characteristic of the preceding Clovis and Folsom examples, their lanceolate
forms are indicative of a continued focus on big-game hunting.
As the Paleoindian period began on the heels of the last major glaciation, it included drastic
environmental changes. The climate gradually became drier and warmer during this period and
multiple game species became extinct. These environmental shifts also led to changes in plant
communities and ultimately, human subsistence practices.
The more intact examples Paleoindian sites in the region tend to be deeply buried along the few
major drainages that transect the Llano Estacado (especially Lubbock Lake at Yellow House Draw,
the Plainview Site at Running Water Draw, and the Clovis Site at Blackwater Draw), on the
margins of playa basins (Ryan Site), and within the canyons that punctuate the margins of the
Caprock, such as at the Lake Theo site in Caprock Canyons State Park (Johnson and Holliday
2004). Projectile points affiliated with this period are occasionally encountered as isolated finds or
in eroded contexts, often mixed with artifacts from later occupations.

Archaic Period
The Archaic Period (8000â1800 BP) began with the onset of more stable modern climatic
conditions and exhibited a slow shift from more mobile hunting strategies to a heavier reliance on
a broader spectrum of local plants and animals (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The Archaic was a
period of eolian deposition associated with warmer and drier conditions, which resulted in the
infilling of many playa basins and drainage valleys (Johnson and Holiday 1995). Although
groundstone occurred sporadically during the Paleoindian Period, the Archaic marks the beginning
of its common use in processing plant matter and seeds, often in association with thermal earth
oven features. Additionally, the first widespread use of thermally-altered lithic material for tool
production occurred during the Archaic. This potentially indicates a decrease in higher-quality
materials traded from more distant locations and the need for people to utilize local resources
(Hofman 1989).
The Early Archaic, ranging from the terminal Paleoindian Period (8000 BP) through
approximately 6500 BP regionally, is poorly documented on the Southern High Plains with few
stratified sites having been excavated to date. Although the record is sparse, based upon the
presence of bison butchering activity areas, Early Archaic subsistence strategies were similar to
those of the Late Paleoindian with a continued reliance on large game (Johnson and Holliday
2004). Early Archaic sites on the Llano Estacado are rare and are presently limited to the draws
and eastern canyonlands.
The Middle Archaic (6500â4500 BP) on the Southern High Plains was a time of excessively dry
and warm climate, demonstrated by the acceleration of eolian deposition throughout the region.
Archeological sites of this subperiod are more numerous and the depositional sequence is better
understood thanks to work done at sites such Blackwater Draw, Mustang Springs, and Lubbock
Lake (Johnson and Holliday 1995). Middle Archaic sites in the region include well-digging sites
like Mustang Springs near the City of Midland (Meltzer 1991). Lubbock Lake contains an
abundance of information from features that date to this timeframe including hearths, butchering
locations, and a burned-caliche earth oven (Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004). Tools typical of
the Middle Archaic include Clearfork Gouges and Williams points (Turner et al 2011).

The Late Archaic (4,500- 2,000 BP) on the Llano Estacado was a period of wetter and cooler
conditions, as evidenced by a decrease in stratified deposits regionally due to slowdown in eolian
deposition. The San Jon and Lubbock Lake sites provide some of the only archeological
information for this region and period. These sites revealed campsites concentrated along the
margins of drainages as well as evidence of bison processing (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Lithic
technology seen on the Late Archaic High Plains is similar to that seen in other regions of Texas,
with corner and side-notched projectile points such as Edgewood, Ellis, and Castroville types
occurring regularly throughout the region (Hofman 1987, Turner et al 2011).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Woodland Period (2,000 BP-ca. AD 1700) began with the slow
introduction of ceramic and bow and arrow technologies to the region. Arrow points and ceramic
sherds both appear in archaeological sites within the region soon after the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric Period, though often in association with dart points, which did not fully disappear from
the region for another thousand years (Johnson and Holliday 2004). Broken into several localized
complexes and foci, the Ceramic subperiod (2000 BPâAD 1540) generally is represented by an
increase in sedentism and foraging while shifting away from concentrated big game hunting (Boyd
2004). Sites on the Llano Estacado of Ceramic Period age include increasing indications of
agricultural activities and permanent adobe dwellings associated with middens (Johnson and
Holliday 2004, Collins 1966). Artifacts specific to the Ceramic subperiod include Scallorn,
Edwards, and Perdiz arrow points, and Ochoa plainware and Jornada polychrome and brown
ceramics (Collins 1966, Shedd 1968, Hofman 1987, Turner et al 2011).
The Protohistoric subperiod began in ca. 1540 with the first contact of Europeans in the region.
Two written records of Franciso VÃ¡squez de Coronadoâs 1540â1542 entrada from New Mexico
into the Southern High Plains exist but tracing his route and finding physical remains have proven
difficult. However, discoveries in Blanco Canyon along the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado
have solidly identified an extended campsite used by the Spanish and their large Native American
contingent for a period during their search for gold on the Great Plains (Hofman 1987, Morris
1997). The Jimmy Owens site, located within Blanco Canyon below the Caprock in Floyd County,
contains numerous crossbow bolts, Spanish â7â nails, and fragments of contemporary Puebloan
ceramics (Blakeslee 2003, THC 2018). After Coronadoâs departure, the remainder of the
Protohistoric subperiod consisted of infrequent contact between Native Americans and Europeans,
and for Native Americans, a continuation of lifeways similar those from before European arrival
(Perttula 2004). Within the Llano Estacado, the Garza complex features prominently during the
Protohistoric. This complex is comprised of distinctive Garza and Lott projectile points,
polychrome ceramics, and evidence of trade between the Llano and New Mexican tribes (Hogan
2006, Mercado-Allinger 2004).

Historic Period
The Historic Period (AD 1700-1968) on the Llano Estacado begins with the general arrival of
European and European-American trade goods and the horse in the archeological record (Johnson
and Holliday 2004). Archeological sites prior to the 20th Century are rare, especially in a preserved
context (Johnson and Holliday 1995). Petroglyphs and pictographs from the region during the early
Historic depict riders on horses and cattle (Newcomb Jr. 1967, Johnson and Holliday 2004). With
the arrival and availability of the horse, Native American tribes on the Great Plains quickly adapted
and changed their lifestyles to a more nomadic strategy based on bison hunting. Quickly-erected

and removed wickiups and tipis amplified these peoplesâ mobility as well (Chipman 1992). During
the early 18th Century, the Comanche began appearing on the Llano Estacado, quickly displacing
the resident Apache bands and becoming the force of Native Americans that would shape much of
Texas history (Gwynne 2010).
As Texan settlers and ranchers moved west, interactions with Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche
bands became common and increasingly violent, culminating in the near extinction of bison from
purposeful overhunting and the subsequent expulsion of Plains tribes from the Llano to
reservations in Oklahoma by the end of the 1870s (Fox 1983). Following the forced removal of
Native American tribes from the region, ranching became the first important post-Native American
economy, though it grew slowly. The Census of 1880 only listed 25 people living in Lubbock
County, most of them ranchers; by 1890 the number had only increased to 33 (Graves 2016a). That
number quickly grew, however, when town promoters Frank E. Wheelock and W.E. Rayner
decided to combine their competing settlements and formed the town of Lubbock in 1890 (Graves
2016b). The population grew as farmers moved to the area, attracted by fertile soil and readily
available land. In 1909 the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway built south through the county;
other rail lines soon followed, leading to a major population increase. In 1900 Lubbock County
only had 293 residents and by 1910 it had 3,624. Texas Technical College (Now Texas Tech
University) opened in Lubbock in 1925, which also drew residents to the city; by 1930 Lubbock
Countyâs population had risen to 39,104 (Graves 2016a).
Between the 1880s and 1920s the agricultural economy of Lubbock County had shifted from
mostly ranching to farming. Sorghum cane, millet and wheat were important early crops in the
region as were sheep, hogs, horses, and chickens. By the 1930s cotton had taken over as the
primary crop, thanks to increasing irrigation from the Ogallala aquifer (Graves 2016a). Cotton
continues to be an important crop in the region today. Sorghum became increasingly important
after World War II since it was used as cattle feed in the growing feedlot industry in the Southern
High Plains.
Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the City of Lubbock and the county
surrounding it have grown exponentially in both economic and population. Today, Lubbock is the
only large city in Lubbock County or the surrounding area and therefore serves as an important
metropolitan hub. Today the city has two universities (Texas Tech and Lubbock Christian), seven
hospitals, 14 banks, dozens of parks, and hundreds of businesses. As of 2014 Lubbock County had
a population of 293,974 and 243,994 of those people lived in the City of Lubbock (Graves 2016a).

Previous Cultural Resource Investigations
Background research for this project included an online records search through the Texas
Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas for previously recorded cultural resources or
archeological surveys within one kilometer of the APE. This search indicated that no NRHP
properties, SALs, cemeteries or archeological sites have been recorded within one kilometer of the
APE. One historical marker is located approximately half a kilometer southeast of the APE, in
front of the National Ranching Heritage Center. The marker was placed in 1970 and
commemorates the free-range era of ranching in northwest Texas between 1878 and 1885 (Atlas
2018). One archaeological survey, located 800 meters south of the APE, was carried out by TxDOT
in 1992 in preparation for construction of the Marsh Sharp Freeway but documented no sites. The
closest archaeological sites to the project area are within the canyon formed by Yellowhouse Draw,
a mostly dry drainage two kilometers to the north, which stretches from Clovis New Mexico to

east Lubbock where it opens into Buffalo Canyon. Among the closest sites is 41LU1, the wellknown Lubbock Lake Site, where 12,000 years of North American prehistory are preserved in well
stratified deposits.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
AmaTerra personnel performed an intensive survey, as outlined in 13 TAC 26.20 (2) and defined
in 13 TAC 26.5. The survey took place within publicly owned property. The field survey was
carried out in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
8415. This survey included pedestrian survey supplemented by shovel testing, following the
Council of Texas Archeologists' (CTA) guidelines for intensive surveys.
Pedestrian survey involved inspecting the ground surface for evidence of archeological sites.
Documentation included narrative notes, maps, and photographs. Per CTA guidelines, the 14-acre
project area required a minimum of seven shovel tests (one test per two acres). Shovel tests
measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended to a maximum depth of 80 cm below
surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments and all soil was screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests (UTM coordinates, soil
color, type, stratigraphic sequence, and findings) was recorded on standardized forms.
Because the project area is in an upland setting not associated with deep lunette dune deposits or
alluvial deposition, backhoe trenching was not used as a survey method during fieldwork.
No artifacts or other materials were collected during the survey. Archeologists documented the
work through notes and photographs, which will be housed permanently at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
Fieldwork was carried out on May 8, 2018 by AmaTerra archeologist Amy Goldstein. Conditions
were fair and warm, and no complications or access issues were encountered during the survey.
The APE is presented on current aerial imagery with survey results in Figure 4.

Surface Inspection
The entire parcel was transected in 15-meter intervals prior to shovel testing to inspect the surface
for artifacts. The surface of the project area was completely grass-covered, but an ongoing regional
drought had thinned the grass to about 20â30-percent surface visibility (Figures 5 through 8).
Other than probable utilities trenching along the edges of the parcel, no previous human
disturbances to the surface were apparent. However, prairie dog burrows were in evidence
throughout the property (Figure 9), which are known to extend from 30 cm to 4 meters deep
depending on climate, water table depth, and local soil conditions (Gano and States 1982).

Shovel Testing
Seven shovel tests were spaced approximately evenly within the APE (see Figure 4, Appendix),
extending to depths of 30 to 70 cmbs. Soils were found to be extremely dry brown clay loams
overlying yellowish red clays, where tests were terminated. No artifacts were discovered on the
surface of the APE or within shovel tests and no archeological resources were identified in the
APE for the proposed VA outpatient clinic.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On May 8, 21018 AmaTerra archeologist Amy Goldstein carried out an intensive survey under
Texas Antiquities Permit 8415 in advance of construction of a proposed VA outpatient clinic on
property owned by Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas. A 100percent surface inspection and seven shovel tests were excavated in the APE, finding no
archeological resources above or below the surface.
Because no archeological resources were identified within the APE, AmaTerra recommends that
construction proceed with no further archeological work. No artifacts or other materials were
collected during fieldwork, and all notes and paperwork generated during the investigation will be
permanently housed at TARL in Austin, Texas.
