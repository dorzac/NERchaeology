Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Lake Wichita Shoreline, Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Carollo Engineers (Carollo), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive archaeological survey of portions of the 22.24-mile shoreline survey of Lake Wichita in Wichita
and Archer Counties, Texas. All work was conducted in support of Carollo’s application requirements for
a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit (USACE File No. SWT-2013-563) in
accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January 31, 2007), and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). All
investigations were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas
Historical Commission’s standards for such projects. All work was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Code Permit Number 7865.
The investigations included an archaeological background review, an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing, a geomorphological assessment and geomorphological subsurface testing,
and an assessment of the project area and associated structures from an architectural history prospective.
The purpose of this cultural resource survey was to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if
possible, determine the significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area.
Following agency approval, the cultural survey included the entire 22.24-mile portion of the Lake Wichita
shoreline within the USACE Tulsa District.
SWCA’s investigation of the proposed project area encompassed the entire 22.24-mile shoreline.
Approximately 573.7 acres were surveyed overall, and within this total approximately 169.1 acres were
subjected to intensive survey with shovel testing. The remaining 404.6 acres were subjected to pedestrian
survey only.
As a result of the current survey effort, seven new structural features, all consisting of pier remains in the
lake, were recorded, no previously recorded sites were revisited, and six isolated finds were identified. The
collected artifacts and project records will be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory in
Austin.
In accordance with 33 CFR 325, Appendix C, Section 106 of the NHPA, and 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1), SWCA
has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the anticipated Permit
Review Areas (PRAs). Based on the results of these investigations and the proposed avoidance measures
recommended, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would have NO EFFECT ON HISTORIC
PROPERTIES (per 36 CFR 800.5[b]) and recommends that the project `be allowed to proceed.

SWCA Project Number. 41264
Location. The proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Tulsa District. This report addresses the entire 22.24-mile Lake Wichita
shoreline survey project area within the USACE Tulsa District in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas.
Area Surveyed. SWCA Environmental Consultants’ (SWCA’s) investigations of the proposed Lake
Wichita shoreline survey encompassed the entire 22.24-miles of the project.
Principal Investigator. J. Eric Gilliland
Purpose of Work. All work was conducted in support of Carollo’s application requirements for a
USACE Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule
1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January 31, 2007), and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its
implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). All work was done under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit
Number 7865.
Number of Sites. As a result of the current survey effort, seven new structural features, all consisting of
pier remains in the lake, were recorded, no previously recorded sites were revisited, and six isolated finds
were identified.
Eligibility. No newly discovered or previously recorded sites are located within or adjacent to (300 feet)
the proposed workspace. Therefore, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would impose NO
EFFECT ON HISTORIC PROPERTIES. As such, NO FURTHER WORK is recommended at this time.
Curation. Two of the isolated finds (CR1-1 and CR1-5) were recovered and brought back to the SWCA
office in Arlington for curation. In addition, project paperwork will also be curated per the requirements
of the TAC permit.
Comments. In accordance with 33 CFR 325, Appendix C, Section 106 of the NHPA, and 36 CFR 800.4
(b)(1), SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the
anticipated Permit Review Areas. Based on the results of these investigations and the proposed avoidance
measures recommended, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would have NO EFFECT ON
HISTORIC PROPERTIES (per 36 CFR 800.5[b]) and recommends that the project be allowed to proceed.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Lake Wichita Shoreline, Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Carollo Engineers (Carollo), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive archaeological survey of the entire 22.24-mile Lake Wichita shoreline in Wichita and Archer
Counties, Texas. All work was conducted in support of Carollo’s application requirements for a U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January
31, 2007), and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC]
470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800). All investigations were conducted in accordance with
the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) standards for
such projects.
The proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey falls under the jurisdiction of the USACE Tulsa District. This
report addresses the approximately 22.24 mile of the proposed shoreline survey within the USACE Tulsa
District in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas.
The investigations included an archaeological background review and an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area. The cultural survey included
the entire 22.24-mile shoreline of Lake Wichita
J. Eric Gilliland served as Principal Investigator. Nicholas Wood served as Project Archaeologist and
directly supervised the fieldwork component of the project. Fieldwork was completed in January and
February 2017 by Robert Brush, Steven Cummins, Miles Martin, and Nicholas Wood. This report was
written by Nicholas Wood under guidance of J. Eric Gilliland, and with contributions from Ken Lawrence
and Hannah Curry-Shearouse. Jayme Fontenot provided geographic information systems (GIS) support
from fieldwork through report production. Koneka McBride provided logistics support for the field efforts.

Project Description
The Lake Wichita shoreline survey consisted of an intensive cultural resource survey of the shoreline of
Lake Wichita, a geomorphological assessment and geomorphological subsurface testing, and an
architectural history assessment of Lake Wichita.
This cultural resource survey is in support of the efforts of the City of Wichita Falls to conduct maintenance
efforts on Lake Wichita consisting of dredging of sediment from the lakebed that has accumulated since
construction of the dam. This sediment has accumulated to the point where it has rendered lake less usable
for the inhabitants of the area, as well as decreased its capacity to absorb rainfall events to decrease flooding.
The survey area for the intensive pedestrian cultural resource survey consisted of the entire lakeshore
(Figure 1).

CHAPTER 2 ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Lake Wichita is located in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas, approximately 5.6 miles southwest of the
city of Wichita Falls, Texas. A background environmental overview of this area follows.

Overlying the Wichita formation with red and blue clays,
sandy shales, and sandstones, including deposits of
gypsum and beds of earthy magnesian limestone.
Carboniferous is overlain uncomfortably by the
Cretaceous, patches of which also appear west and
southwest of the region. Worn specimens of undoubtedly
Cretaceous shells are found hi the gravel escarpments
along Wichita River in Knox and Foard counties.
Sands are mostly red varying to white and are
interstratified with lenses of gravel and red clay, gravels
are well exposed. Pebbles are well rounded and consist of
quartz and crystalline rock, mostly of igneous origin.
Stream valleys are floored throughout the greater part of
their courses by gravels, sands, and silts which have been
transported from higher levels to their present position by
the present streams. Terrace deposits consist of gravel,
sand, and silt of recent origin and are not to be confounded
with the somewhat similar materials composing the
Seymour formation and the apparently related high-level
Pleistocene gravels and conglomerates.

Soils
Because soil surveys were completed long after Lake Wichita was impounded, the Soil Survey of Wichita
County (Richardson et al. 1977) and Soil Survey of Archer County (Daigle 1995) and other U.S.
Department of Agriculture soil maps state that the entire survey area is located within the water of Lake
Wichita. In order to glean information about soils in the project area, a list of the surrounding soils was
made for this report. Table 2 shows the soils that were encountered during the survey of the Lake Wichita
shoreline.

Vegetation
The project area lies within the North-Central Plains region (Wermund 1996). According to the Hart (2017)
and Lewis (2017) , the vegetation in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas, includes, but is not limited to,
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), post oak (Q stellate), pecan (Carya illinoensis), white ash (Fraxinus
americana), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), cottonwood (Populus deltoids), hackberry (Celtis
occidentalis), elm (Ulmus Americana), and willow (Salix spp.) trees. Other areas were originally covered
in various species of grass and shrubs, including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem
(Schizachurium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula),
silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides), laurel greenbriar (Smilax laurifolia), yaupon holly (Ilex
vomitoria), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), coralbean (Erythrina herbacea), saw greenbriar
(Smilax bona-nox), cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), prairie spiderwort (Tradescantia occidentalis), and
Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis) (Ajilvsgi 2003; Brown 1985; Correll and Johnston 1979; Cox and
Leslie 1999; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Lynch 1996; Petrides 1998; Simpson 1988; Stein et al. 2003;
Sutton and Sutton 1985; Vines 1997; Wrede 2005).

Fauna
Some native mammals common to the project area include, but are not limited to, white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus
subflavus), red bat (Lasiurus carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray squirrel (S. carolinensis),
southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat (Oryzomys
palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Kricher and Morrison
1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Historically, red wolf (Canis rufus), bison (Bison bison), and black bear (Ursus americanus) ranged into or
near the project area (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Bison constituted one of the major game resources throughout prehistory. This resource played a profound
role in nearly all aspects of society, including technological organization, mobility, population size, political
organization, and, to an extent, all others. Therefore, understanding periods of relative abundance has been
important to the interpretation of the regional chronology. Studies have discerned periods of presence and
absence (Dillehay 1974), though in much of the project area, these are perhaps more fluctuations in relative
abundance. In the southern Plains, bison were perhaps rare during the Altithermal prior to 5000 B.P., but
around 5,000 to 4,800 years ago, a strong amelioration apparently ushered in sufficient numbers of bison
to constitute an economic mainstay for the regional inhabitants (Thurmond and Wyckoff 1999:245).
Though studies have shown eras where bison were uncommon in the environmental record, the species
likely has been present in the project area to some degree throughout prehistory until recent times.
Avian fauna common or abundant in the area include, but are not limited to, the following species: great
blue heron (Ardea herodias), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), northern shoveler
(Anas clypeata), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), American coot (Fulica americana), killdeer
(Charadrius vociferus), least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), wild
turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens),
blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus
forficatus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), rubycrowned
kinglet (Regulus calendula), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), eastern meadowlark
(Sturnella magna), ring-necked duck (Aythya collaris), pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), purple

martin (Progne subis), cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), and pine warbler (Dendroica pinus) (Brown
1985; Bull and Farrand 1977; Freeman 2003; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985; Wolf et
al. 2001).

Topography and Hydrology
Due to the relatively small size of the project area, the topography of the proposed project varied little and
did not cross many, if any, major topographic settings. The elevation ranged only slightly, between
approximately 972 and 996 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
The alluvial flats along the Wichita and Red Rivers’ plentiful water supplies are found at depths of 20 to
25 feet (Gordon 1913:53). According to Gordon (1913:53), in the valley of the Wichita River, supplies are
obtained generally from wells varying from 18 to 25 feet in depth. In the upland areas of the Wichita region,
cisterns and tanks constitute the chief source of water supply for domestic use and stock. The water stored
holds in suspension a large amount of sediment, which settles very slowly, and the rivers, ponds, and lakes
are rarely (if ever) clear (Gordon 1913:54). Irrigation of water in Wichita County comes mainly from water
in Lake Kemp and Lake Diversion, which were constructed in 1922 (Richardson et al. 1977:73–74). The
water available for irrigation in the Wichita River valley is, according to Richardson et al. (1977:74), of
permissible to doubtful quality, depending on the texture, permeability, chemical nature, and physical
condition of the soil.

CHAPTER 3 CULTURAL SETTING
Texas is a large state with many diverse environments and an abundance of natural resources that have been
exploited throughout a long span of human occupation. This has created a vast array of archaeological sites
as humans have adapted to the numerous biotic communities across the state. The archaeology of Texas
has been divided into a series of regions that roughly correspond with the various geographical and
environmental regions of the state. This chapter presents a regional paradigm of prehistoric and historic
cultural history.

Cultural History
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Texas is generally divided into four broad chronological
categories: the Paleoindian period (approximately 12,000–6000 B.C.), the Archaic period (approximately
6000–200 B.C.), the Formative period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800), and the Late Prehistoric period (beginning
approximately A.D. 800 and continuing to European contact, ca. A.D. 1600.)
The Historic period, beginning ca. A.D. 1600, is marked by the explorations and settlement of Europeans
in what is now Texas following the early entradas of Spanish conquistadores and French settlement attempts
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Historic period in Texas is discussed regionally.

Prehistoric Cultural Setting
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period in Texas begins at the end of the Pleistocene. The best evidence for Paleoindian
occupation in North Texas dates from approximately 9500 to 7500 B.C. (Jurney et al. 1989:14). During the
Paleoindian period, the general model of human settlement is that of small, highly mobile groups that
exploited broad areas for hunting and gathering. While sensational finds have often led to a view of
subsistence based on large game, many sites reveal an intensive exploitation among Paleoindian groups of
locally available small game. As Meltzer and Bever (1995:59) state: “there is ample reason to doubt Clovis
groups were big-game hunters (of mastodon or mammoth). More likely, they were generalized huntergatherers who occasionally pursued big game, but more often exploited smaller, less risky prey. Like
turtles.”
Population levels are inferred to have increased throughout the Paleoindian era, though a specific means of
assessing prehistoric population trends has yet to be formulated and extensively applied. Nevertheless, the
initial period of human settlement was clearly a populating phase in which opportunistic groups established
the first cultural landscapes and social networks.
Diagnostic artifacts from this period generally have been recovered from the surface and include basally
ground, lanceolate-shaped points that are sometimes fluted, such as Clovis and Folsom; however, only
moderate numbers of early Paleoindian points have been reported within the region (Meltzer and Bever
1995). Well-studied sites in and around this region include the Domebo site in Caddo County, Oklahoma;
the Aubrey site and Lewisville Lake in north-central Texas; the Big Pine Lake site; and several sites in the
Red River drainage, including Murphey and Quince (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1990:72; Jurney et al.
1989:15; Peter et al. 1991:6). Late Paleoindian point types identified in the region include Angostura,
Plainview, and Golondrina and date from roughly 8000 to 6800 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1993).
North-central Texas continues to exhibit the greatest absence of Clovis points in the state despite being
surrounded by Clovis-rich areas. Bever and Meltzer (2007) posit that this phenomenon is due to the region’s

geomorphology, which buries sites deeper than in the surrounding areas, rather than the absence of a
Paleoindian presence in the area. Evidence supporting this supposition is found when comparing two of the
investigated sites in north-central Texas with apparently discrete Paleoindian components. The Lewisville
site contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics in a near-surface
context, an accepted and predictable stratigraphy for Paleoindian sites in Texas (Crook and Harris 1957,
1958; Story 1990:182–184). In contrast, the Aubrey site contained lithic debitage and Clovis points buried
beneath 8 meters of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain (Ferring 1989). Deposits at this depth
corroborate Bever and Meltzer’s theory, supply one explanation for the apparent dearth of previously
recorded Paleoindian sites in north-central Texas, and highlight the geological circumstances in which
Paleoindian sites may be located. Both sites also contained a variety of faunal remains both large and small,
although only small game (the largest being white-tailed deer) can be associated comfortably with the
Clovis occupation at the Lewisville site (Hoffman 1989:31–32). The preponderance of small game at the
Aubrey site could be interpreted as representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on
mammoth and bison apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the southern Plains (Hoffman 1989:31–32).
The majority of the recorded Paleoindian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage where the most intensive
archaeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than one or two
points, largely in surface contexts. An analysis of materials collected by C.K. Chandler and other
avocational archaeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleoindian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Golondrina,
and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al. 1998:519–520). Other
early materials from the area include one Folsom point from the Wild Bull site in Henderson County (Story
1965:189–190), a few San Patrice points from Richland-Chambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth
1987:176–179), several Brazos Fishtail and Plainview points from Aquilla Lake in Hill County (Brown
1987:44-1–44-2), a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989),
the Brookeen Creek cache of 173 blades and flakes from Hill County (Mallouf 1981), and one Folsom point
from Lake Limestone (Mallouf 1979:44).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period spans a lengthy period, beginning around 6000 B.C. and ending around 200 B.C. In
general, the Archaic period is one of very strong cultural stability (Peter et al. 1991:6). During this period,
a variety of tools and projectile points were developed (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1990:74). Good
examples of Archaic sites in North Texas include the Jake Martin site in Upshur County, the Yarbrough
site in Van Zandt County, the Manton Miller site on the Upper Sulphur River in Delta County, and the
Finley Fan site in Hopkins County (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1990:75; Perttula 1995:335). The Archaic
period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late periods, each of which is discussed below.
The Early Archaic period spans approximately 6000 to 4000 B.C. There is a lack of well-documented Early
Archaic sites in north-central and east Texas, as Archaic sites in the region often are not single component
sites or are not stratified (Jurney et al. 1989:16; Peter et al. 1991:6). The best excavated transitional
Paleoindian to Early Archaic sites in the region are the Boat Dock site, the Summers site, and the Gore Pit
site (Jurney et al. 1989:17). During the Early Archaic period, populations lived in small groups, making
seasonal nomadic rounds. The use of ground stone tools begins in this period and may indicate a more
intensive use of plant resources. In general, points transitioned from fluted, long lanceolate to non-fluted
during the Paleoindian period and then changed to the shorter, corner-notched triangulate shapes seen in
the Early Archaic (Jurney et al. 1989:16). Dalton, San Patrice, and Meserve are considered transitional point
types and are sometimes included in the Paleoindian period (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1990:72; Jurney et
al. 1989:16; Peter et al. 1991:6). Early Archaic point types in north-central Texas include Big Sandy, Hoxie,
Hardin, and others (Jurney et al. 1989:17; Turner and Hester 1993).

The Middle Archaic period spans approximately 4000 to 2000 B.C. Points increase in size from the Early
to Middle Archaic periods and change from corner-notched to side-notched. Point bases transition from
expanding stem types to parallel stemmed and to the contracting stemmed forms of the Middle and Late
Archaic. Central and north Texas point types associated with the Middle Archaic include Pedernales,
Bulverde, Travis, Nolan, Wells, Carrollton, and Morrill (Turner and Hester 1993). Use of the basal notched
group of points found in central and north Texas may have started late in Early Archaic. Burned rock
middens, common in central Texas during this time, have not been associated with Middle Archaic sites in
north-central Texas. Signs of regionalization are first found at the end of Middle Archaic and continue
during the Late Archaic (Jurney et al. 1989:18). The exchange of non-local materials, and finished tools in
particular, may have been common in some parts of the region during the Middle Archaic period (Perttula
1995:335).
The Late Archaic spans approximately 2000 to 200 B.C. Compared to the Early and Middle Archaic, the
Late Archaic has more sites overall and more archaeological investigations have been conducted at these
sites (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1990:74; Jurney et al. 1989:19). The increase in the number of sites in
North Texas is hypothesized to be the result of increased population densities (Jurney et al. 1989:19–20;
Nickels et al. 1999:21; Perttula 1995:335); however, western portions of north Texas might have been less
populated than other parts of north Texas (Nickels et al. 1999:21). It is hypothesized that populations were
neither sedentary, nor did they occupy sites year-round, but moved within limited geographic areas (Perttula
1995:335). Further evidence of increased regionalization in this period comes from areas, such as the upper
Trinity River drainages, that exhibit increased use of local quartzite to replace non-local chert (Perttula
1995:335). Archaic tool types in north Texas are more varied than in south Texas, and north Texas might
have experienced wetter, more hospitable conditions (Jurney et al. 1989:19). Late Archaic material culture
in northern Texas is associated with the broadly defined LaHarpe Aspect (Espey, Huston, and Associates
1990:4-2; Johnson 1962; Jurney et al. 1989:19). This includes contracting based dart points of which the
Gary type is the most common. Other types include Ellis, Elam, Ensor, Godley, Dallas, Lange, Marshall,
and the slightly earlier Yarbrough and Trinity types (Jurney et al. 1989:19; Kahl et al. 1999:9).

Formative/Woodland Period
The Formative period, also known as the Early Ceramic or Woodland period, is defined as 200 B.C. to A.D.
800. This period is characterized by increasing sedentism and social complexity, as well as possible
increases in population (Story et al. 1990). Technological innovations during this period include the use of
ceramics, bow and arrow technology, and experimentation with plant domestication and horticulture.
In north Texas, sedentary or semi-sedentary populations occupied villages and hamlets located on
floodplains and terraces of larger streams, as well as smaller upland components. The construction of burial
mounds containing non-local materials, such as cherts, copper ornaments, ceramics, and marine shells,
begins during this period on the Middle Sabine, Angelina, Neches, and Red Rivers (Jurney et al. 1989:23;
Peter et al. 1991:7). Among the westernmost of these mounds are the Harlig Morgan and Sanders sites. The
Sanders site is in the extreme northwestern corner of Lamar County at the mouth of Bois d’Arc Creek, near
the Red River (Jurney et al. 1989:24). Harlig Morgan (41FN1), in Fannin County, is the farthest west of the
mound sites, but it has been destroyed since its documentation (Peter et al. 1991:8). There is evidence for
at least limited trading ties with other Middle Woodland groups, and there are similarities between East
Texas mounds from this period and the Hopewell and Marksville mounds of the Mississippi Valley (Jurney
et al. 1989:22–24).
Little evidence of domesticated plant use in the Red River drainage during the Formative period exists;
however, a squash rind from site 41HP137 at Cooper Lake in Hopkins County radiocarbon dates to 140 ±30
B.C. (Jurney et al. 1989:20; Peter et al. 1991:7). Despite a lack of direct evidence, the introduction of
ceramics in this period may be linked to changes in subsistence and food processing (Jurney et al. 1989:22–

23). Inhabitants of the north Texas region probably began to rely on horticulture during the Formative
period, and intensive maize agriculture may have been introduced by the period’s end (Kahl et al. 1999:9–
10).
The major technological innovations of the bow and arrow and ceramic containers are assigned to this
period (Kahl et al. 1999:9; Nickels et al. 1999:22). The use of ceramics within the region is variable, with
some sites (particularly along the Red River) yielding copious numbers of ceramic artifacts while others
(notably between the Sulphur and Sabine Rivers) produce far less. Because ceramics are associated with
boiled foods (particularly those rich in carbohydrates) and increased sedentism, archaeologists have
suggested that sites with high numbers of ceramic artifacts reflect different dietary habits and settlement
practices than sites with few ceramics (Perttula 2004; Skibo and Blinman 1999). Ceramic types tend to be
of the Lower Mississippi Valley type and include Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville
Incised, Marksville Stamped, and Troyville Stamped. The ceramics may have been traded or local potters
may have adopted these styles from neighboring groups (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982).
Early ceramics in the North Texas region are affiliated with the Fourche Maline Phase (Jurney et al.
1989:24). The Fourche Maline cultural tradition is found throughout eastern Oklahoma and southwestern
Arkansas, and may extend into parts of north-central and northeast Texas. Grog-tempered ceramics in the
region are likely associated with Fourche Maline tradition whose ceramics are grog-tempered, often
undecorated, flat-based vessels with flaring sides. Williams Plain, a common Fourche Maline ceramic type,
dates prior to A.D. 800 and is almost always associated with pre-Caddo occupations. The Sanders site may
have a pre-Caddo component, as it yielded a significant amount of Williams Plain. However, these ceramics
were mixed with later material. Sand and grit tempered ceramics, likely associated with the Tchefuncterelated cultures, are generally found in south Texas and southern parts of east Texas (Jurney et al. 1989:22).
Some sandy paste ceramic types were identified at the Cooper Lake Project, south of Fannin County (Jurney
et al. 1989:24).
Mortuary practices from the Formative period provide more evidence for sedentism. The Hurricane Hill
site along the Sulphur River in western Louisiana has yielded flexed, bundle, and cremation burials in a
small burial ground (Perttula 1999). At the Snipes site (41CP8), shallow extended burials included whole
vessels, boatstones, celts, and bifaces used as funerary objects (Schambach 1982). Burial practices at the
Hurricane Hill and Johnny Ford sites across the Red River in Arkansas, are comparable to one another,
suggesting shared belief systems among Woodland period groups (Perttula 2004). Furthermore, Perttula
(2004) maintains that formally bounded cemeteries at Woodland sites suggest the presence of distinctive
social groups based on kinship or residence.

Late Prehistoric Period
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period, after ca. A.D. 700, are common across both the north and central
Blackland Prairie. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at
certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens, such as corn, and arrow
points and ceramics, indicating important technological changes. There may also be evidence of differential
mortuary practices (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) that could
reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure, although this evidence is nowhere near as strong as that
for the Caddo area of north Texas. Prikryl (1990, 1993) defines two chronological periods for the Late
Prehistoric in north-central Texas, which he links to particular projectile point and ceramic types.
Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700–1200) is marked by the Scallorn, Catahoula,
Steiner, Alba, and Bonham arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grog tempered and undecorated,
but there is some evidence of influences from other regions in that some locally manufactured wares display
designs similar to those associated with east Texas Caddo ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures

has been found at sites at Mountain Creek Lake, as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red
River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were
taking place, though this area held onto its Archaic lifestyle even after technological innovations such as
the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981:106).
During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200–1700), influences from the southern Plains became
pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an increase in bison
herd size in north-central Texas (Lynott 1981:106; Prikryl 1990:80). Bison was important to subsistence,
but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases continued the trend toward
horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). In terms of
technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl 1990:80). Items associated with this
assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of which fit the description for the type
Nocona Plain (shell tempered), and unstemmed triangular arrow points such as Maud, Fresno, Harrell, and
Washita, as well as Perdiz points. Tools specific to bison processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail
scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian
sites, have been recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin
counties (Barber 1969:118–119; Harris 1945).
The collections studied during the Superconducting Super Collider project contain substantial numbers of
both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and
Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et al. (1998:521, 527) note that early arrow points are more frequent,
perhaps reflecting continued high population densities from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz
and Scallorn types, which have such widespread distributions, the arrow point styles indicate eastern and
northern influences. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches
Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also support interaction
with Caddo groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998:521–522). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills
Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of the Late
Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small collection relating to the early Caddo types
Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at
Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz
points, along with a small collection of highly fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
Some of the best data concerning how Native Americans used the region during the Late Prehistoric period
is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at Richland-Chambers
Reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there was a significant decline in
population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:245). The data suggest that most
of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were used for residential purposes (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:241, 244, 246), although there are some sites, for example the stream-side concentrations of
mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139, that probably were used in a more limited fashion.
The house patterns at the Bird Point Island site point to intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during
the first half of the period, while other components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g.,
at Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features
suggesting intensive use but no houses (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:241, 244, 246).
These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in length. Macrobotanical remains point
to use primarily of wild plant foods, i.e., hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor
and Bruseth 1987:243). The only tropical cultigen is maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in
contexts dating to the last half of the period. Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly
hunters and gatherers. The arrow points that characterize the early and late parts of the period—Alba,
Scallorn, and Steiner versus Perdiz and Cliffton—are the same styles as found elsewhere across the area,
and it appears that Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric

(McGregor and Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddo wares,
with most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity.
In north-central Texas, extending slightly into south-central Oklahoma within the Prairie and Cross Timbers
setting, the Henrietta focus was originally defined by Krieger (1946) for Plains Village occupations along
the upper Red River and Brazos River valleys founded on the Harrell site and other associated sites in the
area with a suggested date range of A.D. 1450 to 1600 due to the presence of Puebloan pottery at some of
the sites (Drass 1998; Krieger 1946). More specifically, the Henrietta complex encompasses an area along
the Red River south to the upper Brazos, west to the Wichita and possibly the Peace Rivers west of Wichita
Falls, and east to the headwater region of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Brooks 1989; Drass 1998;
Krieger 1946). Due to insufficient research investigations of these sites, the data set is rather limited and
does not offer good examples of sedentary farming coupled with hunting and gathering nor radiocarbon
dates (Drass 1998).
The Chicken House, Coyote, Dillard, Glass, and Harrell sites comprise recognized Henrietta complex sites
with calibrated radiocarbon dates between A.D. 1100 to 1430 available for the Chicken House and Dillard
occupations on Fish Creek and a date of A.D. 1485 for another site along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River
(Drass 1998; Martin 1994). Lorrain (1967) claims the focus/complex terminated soon after A.D. 1400.
Prikryl (1990) suggests a date range from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and others propose it is contemporaneous with
the Washita River phase, due to the likeness of the assemblages that dates from A.D. 1250 to 1450, though
some occupations could date before A.D. 1200 (Drass 1998).
The Henrietta complex includes small camps to large villages positioned on terraces and uplands near major
streams with individual to group burials possibly in specific areas and the larger villages containing houses,
hearths, and storage pits (Drass 1998). Although data are limited, some sites have revealed oval houses with
wall posts and four major interior support posts with most structures containing rock hearths and cylindrical
cache pits (Lorrain 1967, 1969; Drass 1998). A primary characteristic of the Henrietta complex is the
Nocona Plain pottery with shell temper and similar specimens encountered at Washita River phase sites, as
well as poorly documented Bryan-focus sites in south-central Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis 1951; Drass
and Swenson 1986; Drass 1998). Prikryl and Perttula (1995:192) note that limestone temper is also
common. The lithic assemblage includes mainly Washita and Harrell side-notched and Fresno unnotched
arrow points, diamond beveled knives, end and side scrapers, T-shaped or square-based drills, gravers, and
spokeshaves. The bone tools assemblage consists of bison-bone digging implements, such as scapula hoes
and deer-jaw sickles, similar to other Southern Plains Village complexes (Drass 1998).

Historic Context
Archer County
Archer County is located in north-central Texas, with Wichita County to the north, Baylor County to the
west, Young County to the south, and Clay and Jack Counties to the east. Spaniards and Anglos crossed
through the area at various times, and in the eighteenth century French traders operated a post close to the
two small mesas in the west-central area later called Little Arizona. Kichais defeated the Texas Rangers in
the battle of Stone Houses in southeastern Archer County in 1837, and Kiowas led by Kicking Bird defeated
United States cavalrymen led by Capt. Curwen B. McLellan in the battle of the Little Wichita River in the
northwestern part of the county in 1870. On January 22, 1858, the Texas legislature marked off Archer
County from Clay County and named it in honor of Republic of Texas commissioner Branch Tanner Archer.
No settlers had yet arrived. By 1875, however, the U.S. Army had driven all the Indians from north Texas
and the area was open to settlement (Lewis 2017).

In 1874 the first American settler, Dr. R.O. Prideaux, originally from England, settled on the West Fork of
the Trinity River in southeastern Archer County. He had observed that the buffalo he had shot there were
fat. Soon other cattlemen and farmers moved in, and scattered herds of longhorn cattle were introduced to
different parts of the county’s grasslands. Along with buffalo hunters, the pioneer cattlemen led the way
for other American settlers by eliminating great herds of buffalo and antelope. Imaginary lines were drawn
and agreed upon between herd owners. Cowboys rode these lines daily to drive stray animals back to their
respective territories. Barbed wire was introduced in the fall of 1880, and great pastures were fenced. Herd
owners divided the county into three portions. The T Fork and 99 pastures controlled the north section, the
OX Ranch and Circle Ranch pastures formed the central part, and the LM, TIP, JJ, CLA Bar, Mule Shoe,
GAR, Figure 3, Lazy H, and other smaller ranches occupied the southern portion (Lewis 2017).
Meanwhile, farmers were also moving into the area. Colonists located vacant or unpatented lands
throughout the county and built dugout or log, board, or stone houses. By 1880, 596 people lived on 53
ranches and farms in Archer County. Over 56,000 cattle were counted by the United States agricultural
census in the county that year, along with 1,423 sheep. Over 400 acres were planted in corn in the county
in 1880, and smaller areas were planted with oats and wheat. Cotton, grown on about 100 acres, produced
43 bales (Lewis 2017).
In November 1879 farmers combined with the small ranchers in Archer County and presented a petition to
the commissioners’ court of Clay County calling for the political organization of Archer County. Larger
cattle interests, bitterly opposed to organization, protested and delayed the process, but in the spring of 1880
the court ordered an election. Archer County was organized on July 27 of that year (Lewis 2017).
Railroads played an important role in attracting settlers to the county during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. In 1890 the Wichita Valley Railway crossed northern Archer County, giving rise to the
towns of Holliday, Mankins, and Dundee. In 1908 the Wichita Falls and Southern Railway pushed south
through Archer City on its way to the coal supply of Newcastle in neighboring Young County. In 1909 the
Henrietta and Southwestern began to serve Scotland and Archer City, and the next year the Gulf, Texas and
Western built through Megargel on its way to Seymour. This railroad construction helped to tie the county
to the national marketplace and encouraged immigration into the area. By 1910, 6,525 people lived in
Archer County and 792 farms had been established. Ranching declined somewhat during this period, but
continued to be a crucial mainstay of the local economy. In 1890 more than 75,000 cattle were counted in
Archer County; in 1900, 65,627 were counted; in 1910, there were just over 41,000 cattle in the county;
and about the same number was counted in 1920 (Lewis 2017).

Wichita County
Wichita County was the ancestral home for Caddoan tribes, particularly the Wichita and Taovayas. The
area was also popular with Comanche and Apache tribes. Wichita County was first settled by Anglo
populations in the 1830s following the Texas Revolution, when the Republic of Texas paid its volunteer
army in land (Hart 2017). Violence between tribes and against the Anglo settlers made permanent
settlements difficult until the 1850s when federal troops forced the tribes to relocate (Hart 2017). The first
land survey in the county was performed in 1854 by the Texas Emigration and Land Company, and the first
permanent Anglo settler moved to a site north of Wichita Falls in 1855 (Hart 2017). Wichita County was
officially established by the Texas legislature in 1858, sharing a judicial area with Clay County to its east
(Hart 2017). However, most Anglo settlers did not arrive in the county until after 1870 (Hart 2017).
Wichita County’s population reached over 400 in the 1880 census, prompting in 1882, a petition to separate
the governance of Wichita County from Clay County. The petition’s sponsor, Robert E. Huff, presented the
signatures to the Clay County commissioners, and the first elections for dedicated Wichita County officials
occurred on June 21 of that year (Hart 2017).

The county’s economy in the late nineteenth century depended largely on cattle ranching, corn, and hay
production, and the first train in the county came from Ft. Worth in 1882 with the Fort Worth and Denver
City Railroad (Hart 2017). The new rail line, which connected to the then small settlement of Wichita Falls,
spurred other new rail development in the burgeoning city. Wichita Falls, established in 1879 when the post
office was constructed, quickly became a regional hub for transportation and commerce. Encouraged by
local businessmen Joseph A. Kemp and Frank Kell, the Wichita Falls and Northwestern, Wichita Falls and
Southern, and the Wichita Falls and Wellington Railroads soon moved into the settlement as well (Hart
2017). In 1911, all of the rail lines were purchased and consolidated under the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas
line.
Though oil was noticed seeping into area water wells as early as 1901, the Electra oil field was established
in Wichita County in 1911. However, it was a major discovery in Burkburnett in 1918 that propelled
Wichita County to wealth and prosperity. Wichita Falls, by then established as the county seat, already had
the infrastructure needed to sustain transportation and communications benefited significantly from the
surge in oil production as companies chose the city for regional offices. Wichita Falls’ local leaders also
lured the Army Air Corps to establish a training facility in the town, and Call Field was constructed in 1918
(Minor 2017a). The last military personnel left the facility just a year later.
By 1930, Wichita Falls was home to 80 percent of the county’s population, which the census recorded as
60,000, and by 1940, Wichita County was producing more oil than any other county in Texas. Agricultural
work was still important to the county’s economic output, with over 1,000 farms and ranches in the county
still providing cattle, corn, hay, and cotton. Despite the oil production, the county did suffer during the
1930s. Displacement saw the county population shrink, and the value of the county’s farms fell by 50
percent.
When the United States entered World War II, Wichita County, like the rest of the country, saw its fortunes
reverse. Agricultural profitability returned, local factories and mills began to hire again, and the Army Air
Corp established Sheppard Field north of Wichita Falls in 1941. The base closed in 1946 and reopened in
1950 as Sheppard Air Force Base. The base remains open to this day (Minor 2017b). Presently, Wichita
County’s economic output still depends on oil and agriculture, while Wichita Falls has the additional
economic benefit of Sheppard Air Force Base, medical facilities, and the county government (Hart 2017).

Lake Wichita
Lake Wichita is an artificial lake 3 miles southwest of Wichita Falls in southeastern Wichita County and
northeastern Archer County. The concept for Lake Wichita was first publicized in 1887 when Joseph A.
Kemp tried to create a bond issue that would provide the funding for forming a dam and reservoir from
Holliday’s Creek (Minor 2017a). However, such bond issues were prohibited under the state constitution
at the time. Though Kemp lobbied at both the state and federal levels to amend the state constitution, his
efforts failed. As a result, Kemp founded the Lake Wichita Irrigation and Water Company in 1900 in order
to fund privately the dam’s construction and lake formation. Lake Wichita was formed in 1901 through the
construction of an earthen dam for Holliday’s Creek, and it straddles the Wichita and Archer County lines,
with the vast majority of the lake residing in Wichita County. When the lake was formed, much of the land
it now covers was within the limits of a small town called Bowman located in the northern part of Archer
County. The town’s 150 residents relocated further south into Archer County when the land was purchased
to form the lake (Jasinski 2017).
Costing $175,000, it was the largest artificial lake in Texas at the time (Brollier 1944). The lake covered
2,200 acres, held 14,000 acre-feet (a unit of volume equivalent to 325,851 gallons), and had an additional
drainage area of 134 square miles (Lake Wichita 2017). Lake Wichita was only the third human-made lake

in the state, following Lake Austin and Eagle Lake (Lake Wichita 2017). The lake provided all of the water
for Wichita Falls as well as irrigation for the surrounding farms (Federal Writers Project 2013).
Lake Wichita quickly became a popular spot for recreation and leisure. Nicknamed the “Gem of North
Texas,” travelers flocked to the lake. In 1909, Wichita Falls opened a trolley line between the city and the
three-story Colonnade pavilion on the lake’s eastern shore (Lake Wichita 2017). Lakeside Hotel established
itself nearby, and it was a popular vacation destination until it burned down in 1918 (Lake Wichita 2017).
Lake Wichita continued to be privately owned by a series of individual and company interests before the
City of Wichita Falls was able to purchase the reservoir in 1920 (Lake Wichita 2017). Once under municipal
control, the city quickly replaced the original earthen dam with a concrete dam completed in 1921 (Texas
Water Development Board 2017). The city continued to use the reservoir for recreational activities as well,
evidenced by carnivals sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in both 1928 and 1929 (Lake Wichita
2017). However, activity at the lake soon declined, and the pavilion only remained until 1955 (Lake Wichita
2017). In 1995, as part of an effort to control flooding, the dam’s spillway was lowered 4.7 feet, reducing
the lake’s surface area from 2,200 acres to 1,224 acres (Lake Wichita 2017). The City of Wichita Falls
continues to maintain a public park at Lake Wichita along the reservoirs northern shoreline. The park
features hike and bike trails, playground, basketball courts, baseball and softball fields, football fields, an
18-hole disc golf course, a model airplane landing strip, dog park, and picnic areas (City of Wichita Falls
Parks and Recreation Department 2017).

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Lake Wichita Shoreline, Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas

CHAPTER 4 METHODS
Cultural resources investigations for the proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey were designed to
accurately determine the nature, extent, and, if possible, significance of any cultural resources located along
the shoreline survey area. The archaeological survey included the area of direct impact. All investigations
were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the THC minimum
archaeological survey standards, and the Council of Texas Archaeologists Guidelines for Performance,
Curation, and Reports.

Background Review
Prior to field investigations, SWCA performed a cultural resources file records review to determine if the
project area had been previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any archaeological sites had been
recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project area.
In June 2016, an SWCA archaeologist conducted a cultural resources background review for the proposed
Lake Wichita shoreline survey (SWCA Project Number 41264) in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas.
The purpose of this background review was to identify previous cultural resources surveys, previously
recorded archaeological sites, or any other known historic properties located within 1 mile of the proposed
project area and to provide a professional assessment regarding the potential for the presence of unrecorded
cultural resources within the proposed project area. Information sources consulted for this background
review include the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
database, and historic topographic maps.
These sources provided the locations and nature of any previously recorded cultural resources surveys,
previously recorded prehistoric and/or historic archaeological sites, cemeteries, and NRHP
districts/properties, within the proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey project area.

Archaeological Survey
Based on the nature of the regulatory conditions, the overall landform and geographical and geological
setting, and consultations with the USACE and THC, a pedestrian archeological survey of the entire
lakeshore, a geomorphological assessment of the proposed project area, and an architectural historical
evaluation of the proposed project area were selected as appropriate methods for the conduct of the cultural
resources survey. In addition to accessing the lakeshore by foot, field crews used a small boat to survey
portions of the lake not easily reached by foot.

Pedestrian Survey/Shovel Testing
In discussions with USACE and THC personnel on December 12, 2016, the appropriate methods for the
archeological portion of the survey were addressed. At this time, it was decided that a complete pedestrian
survey of the lakeshore was an appropriate survey methodology. It was agreed that the survey area would
consist of the former lake shoreline between the original water level of the lake at approximately 980.4 feet
amsl and the current lake pool located at 976 feet amsl. It was agreed that the archaeologists would walk
the entire lakeshore, but only areas defined as having a high potential for containing cultural resources
would be subjected to shovel testing. These 13 areas, called high probability areas (HPAs), would be
surveyed using pedestrian survey and shovel testing. All areas outside these HPAs received pedestrian
survey only. When conducing shovel testing, crews would follow standard Texas guidelines and only
excavate shovel tests in areas where ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent.

Shovel tests were 30-centimeter in diameter and excavated in 20-centimeter arbitrary levels to a depth of
1-meter or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. Archaeologists screened all excavated soil
through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth to retrieve and cultural materials that might be present. The location
of each shovel test recorded using a Trimble GeoXT handheld global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
Data for each shovel test was recorded on appropriate field forms. Soils were described using standard
terminology and colors were identified with a Munsell Soil Color Chart.

Geomorphology
As also agreed in the December 12, 2016, meeting, SWCA had the proposed project area evaluated by a
geomorphologist. This analysis reviewed existing knowledge of the geomorphology of the Lake Wichita
area and assessed the potential for the project area to contain buried soils that might have a high potential
for containing intact, buried cultural resources. Once this analysis was completed, the potential was
analyzed and the need for additional geomorphological fieldwork was assessed at that time. The
geomorphological report is presented in Appendix A.

Architectural History Analysis
The architectural history survey sought to identify all historic-age resources within the project area and to
analyze them for physical integrity and historical significance. All resources with the potential to have been
built during or prior 1972 were identified as historic-age resources. The lake itself, constructed in 1901,
was also evaluated for historic significance. Consultation with THC indicated that because the project is
planned currently only for the existing lakebed, no construction outside the lakebed would be affected by
the planned dredging. A desktop survey was performed to identify historic-age resources within the existing
lakebed.
The methods for field survey and reporting for this project includes five components: 1) a background
review of historic resources within the survey APE; 2) a compilation of suitable historic contexts within the
project area; 3) review of historic and current maps and historic and current aerial photography; 4)
identification of every historic-age property within the survey APE, and 5) the production of a report of
results.
SWCA performed a background literature review to determine if the survey APE had been previously
surveyed for historic resources Additionally, SWCA contacted THC regarding similar reports for historicage lakes and any previously recorded NRHP listed lakes in Texas or nationwide.
To develop a historic context for the area, SWCA historians used the Handbook of Texas Online (2017)
and histories of Wichita County. The information from these secondary sources was compiled and
integrated into suitable historic contexts for the project area, focusing on the agricultural industry of Wichita
County, the development of rail and road transportation networks, and settlement.
During the fieldwork for the historic resource reconnaissance survey, structures, buildings, objects, and
sites visible from the existing right-of-way were analyzed for physical integrity and historical significance.
All resources with the potential to have been built during or prior to 1972 were photographed at an oblique
angle, if possible, from the roadway or public access using a digital camera, and diagnostic features and
landscape conditions were noted. An SWCA architectural historian made the evaluations on the property’s
age, integrity, and significance. Each property was given a resource ID number, and data such as location,
address (if possible), property type, form or plan, stylistic influence, construction date, documentation, and
NRHP recommendation was noted in the field. Properties clearly built after 1972 were not photographed
during this process unless occupying a parcel containing historic-age resources.

CHAPTER 5 RESULTS OF BACKGROUND REVIEW
Prior to the field investigation, an SWCA archaeologist conducted a background review and environmental
literature search of the project area to determine the location and content of any previously documented
archaeological surveys and sites within a 1-mile radius of the proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey. The
background review provided site data and geographic information critical to the discovery and
interpretation of all cultural resources within the project area and allowed SWCA to refine the proposed
survey scope and methods accordingly. The following information describes all previously documented
cultural resources identified within the project area.

Previously Cultural Resources Surveys
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas depicted one small cultural resources survey near the southeast corner
of the survey area. This cultural resources survey was conducted in 1983 and was a linear survey that
extended primarily along Kemp Boulevard and entered the extreme southeastern portion of the study area.
No information is available regarding this survey, but because it ended at the City of Lakeside city office,
it was likely associated with utilities for this community. No cultural resources were recorded as a result of
this survey.

Previously Recorded Archaeological Sites
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas does not depict any previously recorded archaeological sites, NRHP
properties, Registered Texas Historical Landmarks, cemeteries, or neighborhood surveys within or adjacent
to the proposed survey area.
The following historic topographic maps were reviewed: 1954 Wichita Falls 1:250,000 scale; 1956 Lake
Wichita 1:24,000 scale; 1957 Wichita Falls West 1:62,500 scale; 1958 Wichita Falls 1:250,000 scale; 1975
Lake Wichita 1:250,000 scale; 1981 Lake Wichita 1:24,000 scale; and 1981 Wichita Falls 1:100,000 scale.
The 1956 Lake Wichita 1:24,000-scale map depicts several houses south of what is now Lakeshore Drive
in the north-central portion of the study area. It is likely that these are the same houses that are present in
this area now.
The map also depicts a few houses on the south side of the lake across from Lakeshore Drive. Given that
these houses are more than 50 years in age, it is possible that some are eligible for the NRHP. These same
houses are also depicted on the 1957 Wichita Falls 1:62,500-scale topographic map and the 1981 Lake
Wichita 1:24,000-scale topographic map. In addition, the 1956 Lake Wichita 1:24,000-scale, the 1957
Wichita Falls 1:62,500-scale, the 1981 Lake Wichita 1:24,000-scale, and the 1981 Wichita Falls 1:62,500scale maps depict an aqueduct north of the lake. This aqueduct runs from the “Secondary Reservoir” located
north of Lake Wichita to the southwest. The right-of-way of this aqueduct crosses the extreme western edge
of the study area. Much of the former right-of-way of this aqueduct is clearly visible on aerial photographs.
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay did not depict any historic resources
in the study area.

CHAPTER 6 RESULTS
Results of the Archaeological Survey
In January and February 2017, SWCA archaeologists conducted investigations along the entire proposed
Lake Wichita shoreline survey in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas. This section presents the results of
archaeological investigations for 158 shovel tests (Figure 2 and Figure 3). During the investigation, the
entire 22.24-mile project area was surveyed along the shoreline. The archaeological investigations used
pedestrian inspection augmented by shovel testing.
The area around the Lake Wichita shoreline varied from marshy swamp-like areas, plowed and planted
farms, ranch/pasture land, and residential lake-front properties (Figure 4 and Figure 5).
The archaeological survey included the excavation of 158 shovel tests. Of the 158 shovel tests, 34 were
attempted, but not excavated due to the presence of disturbances or standing water or were deemed
unnecessary because the ground surface visibility was greater than 30 percent (Figure 6 and Figure 7).
Shovel tests were excavated in pre-determined HPAs. HPAs were selected based on geographic landforms
and historic records and maps that showed areas of historic archaeological significance, like the aqueduct
within HPA 01 and the pavilion and pier on HPA 05. Of the 158 excavated shovel tests, zero were positive
for cultural material. Depths of the shovel tests varied from 0 to 60 centimeters below surface (cmbs) and
were terminated due to compact soils, bedrock, or other disturbances. Soils encountered during the survey
included blocky clays, sandy clays, and silty clays.
Seven properties referred to as Structural Features were newly recorded as a result of the current survey
effort. All seven of these features consist of the remains of piers that went into Lake Wichita. In consultation
with the Texas Historical Commission, it was decided that these remains should be recorded as structural
features, and not as archaeological sites. Therefore, no archaeological sites were completed for these
features and no site numbers were assigned to them. No previously recorded sites were revisited, and six
isolated finds were identified.

Structural Features
SF-1

SF-1 is what remains of a possible historic pier (Figure 8 and Figure 9), located off the shoreline of Lake
Wichita, approximately 755 feet (230 meters) southwest of the intersection of Lakeshore Drive and Fairway
Boulevard. There are 11 large wooden pylons for a possible historic pier. Field archaeologists could not
determine the age of the site due to pylons being in the lake. The area was analyzed from the shoreline. SF1 is considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP due to the ubiquitous nature of the structure and lack
of integrity due to poor condition.

IF-CR2-1 (Figure 29) is two pieces of historic light blue/aqua colored glass. IF-CR2-1 was discovered on
the surface approximately 72 feet (22 meters) north of the current Lake Wichita shoreline, approximately
80 feet (50 meters) south of Lakeshore Drive, and approximately 1,496 feet (456 meters) west-southwest
of the intersection of Lakeshore Drive and Fairway Boulevard. IF-CR2-1 is considered ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.

Historic Pavilion and Pier
On January 25, 2017, two SWCA archaeologists began survey of a location on the Lake Wichita dam that
was reportedly the site of a historic pavilion and pier. Shovel tests were excavated in the area, and at
approximately 50 cmbs black, plastic tarping was encountered. It became clear that any remains other than
the original foundation of the pavilion had been demolished and capped over. The historic pier and wooden
pillars were visible and still standing in the water, and the original foundation of the pavilion was also
visible (Figure 30−Figure 34).
Due to the extensive disturbance done to the area, the lack of any cultural materials other than the piers
themselves, and the lack of structural remains other than a concrete foundation, this site is considered to
lack research potential. Therefore, the area is recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP. Because
the site lack cultural materials other than the piers, a site trinomial was not requested.

Architectural History Research Results
The field reconnaissance survey identified a total of two historic-age resources within the survey APE
(identified as Resource IDs 1–2): Lake Wichita itself and its dam. The dam is considered a separate
resource.
Resource ID 1 is Lake Wichita. Lake Wichita is a human-made lake formed in 1901 as described in the
historic context. Consultation with the THC regarding the NRHP eligibility of human-made lakes indicated
that no lakes are currently listed in the NRHP. Lake Wichita is not the first human-made lake, either in the
United States or Texas. Lake Wichita is also not the largest lake in Texas. Given that lakes have not been
listed in the NRHP historically, Lake Wichita does not rise to the level of significance necessary to become
the first lake eligible for listing in the NRHP. As a result, it is SWCA’s recommendation that Resource ID
1 is NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the NRHP.
Resource ID 2 is the Lake Wichita Dam. It is located along the northeastern portion of the lake, just east of
the main embankment, which is delineated by a perfectly straight edge. Resource ID 2 is a concrete spillway
dam. Resource ID 2 was constructed in 1921, shortly after the City of Wichita Falls acquired ownership of
the lake, and it replaced the previous earthen dam used to form the lake. In 1995, a new uncontrolled
spillway for the dam was constructed at a height 4.7 feet lower than the previous dam to help control
flooding in the area.
Engineering drawings from the USACE demonstrate that the new spillway was constructed in a different
location than the original. The new spillway, located approximately 275 feet southwest of the original,
resulted in the loss of the original spillway. It also resulted in the loss of public road that spanned the original
spillway.
In constructing the new spillway, the dam lost its integrity of design and location. Its integrity of materials,
workmanship, and feeling are also severely diminished through the removal of both the original spillway
and creating the new spillway in an existing portion of the lake. The original materials and workmanship
used to create the original spillway are no longer extant. The lost materials also affect the feeling of the
dam, detracting from the historic character of the structure.
Though the dam’s integrity of setting and association remain largely unaffected, the other lost aspects of
integrity have a significant impact on the dam’s historical significance. Without the original spillway, a
crucial component of any dam design, the dam does not retain enough integrity to rise to the standards of
NRHP eligibility. For these reasons, SWCA recommends that the dam is NOT ELIGIBLE for listing in the
NRHP.

CHAPTER 7 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Carollo, SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed 22.24-mile
Lake Wichita shoreline survey project in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas. All work was conducted in
support of Carollo’s application requirements for a USACE Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 CFR
323, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January
31, 2007), and Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA and the
THC standards for such projects. All efforts were conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit Number
7865.
The proposed Lake Wichita shoreline survey project falls under the jurisdiction of the USACE Tulsa
District and is being conducted under USACE File No. SWT-2013-563. This report addresses the entire
22.24-mile project area within the USACE Tulsa District in Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas.
The investigations included an archaeological background review, an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing, a geomorphological analysis and subsurface geomorphological testing, and
an architectural history analysis. The purpose of the cultural resources survey was to systematically identify,
record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the significance of any cultural resources located within the
proposed project area. The cultural survey area included the area of direct impact along the shoreline of
Lake Wichita.
As a result of the current survey effort, seven structural features were newly recorded, no previously
recorded sites were revisited, and six isolated finds were identified, and Lake Wichita and its associated
dam were evaluated for their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. All properties located are considered
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In accordance with 33 CFR 325, Appendix C, Section 106 of the NHPA, and 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1), SWCA
has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the area of direct impact.
Based on the results of these investigations, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would have NO
EFFECT ON HISTORIC PROPERTIES (per 36 CFR 800.5[b]) and recommends that the project be
allowed to proceed.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Lake Wichita Shoreline, Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas

A.1

INTRODUCTION

The investigations detailed in this appendix regard the geomorphic setting of Lake Wichita in Archer and
Wichita Counties, Texas. The goal of this assessment is to characterize the natural formation processes of
the project area and to identify post-depositional processes that may have affected any cultural resources
located within the Lake Wichita pondage. The specific goals of this study include:
1. a characterization of the potential and density of cultural resources that may be within the project
area;
2. a recommendation of how to identify these potential cultural resources; and,
3. the identification of any potential impacts to these cultural resources.
The arrangement of this appendix begins with a description of the methods used for the geomorphic study,
followed by an overview of the soils, geology, and hydrology of the project area and region. Subsequent to
that, a review of previous investigations relevant to the Lake Wichita project area is provided, followed by
the results of the current geomorphic assessment and recommendations for future research.

A.2

METHODS

Intensive cultural resources investigations were conducted in 13 select HPAs within Lake Wichita (Figure
A.1). To supplement these investigations, a geomorphological assessment was undertaken to characterize
the potential for deeply buried intact deposits in the project area capable of containing cultural materials.
The geomorphological assessment was conducted via desktop and field analyses. The desktop analysis
involved the examination of topographic maps, a review of soil and geologic maps, hydrology data, and
previous geomorphological or geoarchaeological investigations in the region. The field analyses involved
the examination of Holliday and Pecan Creeks upstream from Lake Wichita and the excavation of a series
of auger probes in select areas. Soil matrix was collected from several of the auger probes to be examined
in the laboratory subsequent to the field investigations.

A.3

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The general landscape of Lake Wichita consists of a broad valley basin centered upon Holliday Creek and
several tributaries (e.g., Pecan Creek). Lake Wichita is surrounded by uplands and upland ridges that rise
as much as 15 m (50 feet) above Lake Wichita. The immediate margins around Lake Wichita are generally
3 m (10 feet) above the reservoir. Overall, the surrounding uplands have gradual slopes that are blanketed
by colluvial drape, which erode into the various tributary drainages and eventually into Lake Wichita.
The Lake Wichita project area is located within the North Central Plains physiographic province (Swanson
1995). The North Central Plains is described as having variable relief dependent upon resistance to erosion
of the Paleozoic geologic formations that underlay the area. The strata of this physiographic region dip and
become progressively younger to the west (Swanson 1995:29). The geologic formations of this region are
derived from progressive filling of a late Paleozoic marine basin in West Texas, which carried alluvial
sediment westward from the Ouachita Range, which now underlies the Dallas, Texas, area (Swanson
1995:29).
From oldest to most recent, the surface geology of and surrounding Lake Wichita area is composed of the
Permian-age Wichita Group, Permian-age Clear Fork Group, Pleistocene-Holocene Fluviatile terrace
deposits, and recent alluvium (Barnes 1987). The Wichita Group deposits are Petrolia Formation
sandstones, mudstone, shale, conglomerate, and limestone. The Clear Fork Group deposits are described as
informal sandstone members that are found in various formations (Barnes 1987). Of relevance to cultural
resources, the Pleistocene-Holocene Fluviatile terrace deposits are characterized as containing gravel, sand,

silt, and clay, while the Holocene alluvium similarly contains gravel, sand, silt, clay, and organic material.
The older deposits from the Wichita and Clear Fork Groups are situated in the uplands, with the more recent
deposits of the Pleistocene-Holocene positioned along Holliday Creek and its tributaries.
Similar to the underlying geology mapped within Lake Wichita, the soils for the project area tend to be
younger or less developed along the drainages, while the uplands are composed of older deposits. Briefly,
the upland soils in order of prevalence includes Deandale silt loam, Bluegrove fine sandy loam, and Kamay
silt loam. The Deandale silt loams (0–3 percent slopes) are formed in clayey slope wash over slope alluvium
or clayey residuum (Daigle 1995; Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2017). The Bluegrove
fine sandy loam (1–8 percent slopes) is formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and claystone, while
the Kamay silt loam (0–3 percent slopes) is derived from deposits formed in clayey redbeds.
Specific soil series within Lake Wichita are more difficult to discern, due to when the reservoir was
impounded (i.e., 1901), which predates soil surveys of the area (Figure A.2). However, in order of
predominance the soils mapped along the drainages emptying into Lake Wichita include Winters loam, Port
and Wheatwood soils, Tipton-Urban Complex soils, and Tillman clay loam. The dominant Winters loam
(0–3 percent slopes) are nearly level to gently sloping soils formed from loamy or clayey alluvial sediments
derived from soil developed in old stream alluvium; they may also be plains outwash or more local valley
fill (Daigle 1995; NRCS 2017). The frequently flooded Port and Wheatwood soils are described as very
deep silt loams formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of recent age situated along gently sloping floodplains
(Figure A.2). Notably, both the Port and Wheatwood series indicate the presence of buried A horizons (i.e.,
paleosols) in some pedons below 76 cm (30 inches) (NRCS 2017). The Tipton-Urban soils are formed in
calcareous loamy and silty alluvium of late Pleistocene or Holocene age occupying level to moderately
sloping upland terraces (Daigle 1995; NRCS 2017). The Tillman clay loams (1–3 percent slopes) are
characterized as loamy and clayey alluvium derived from redbed clays and claystone sediments of Permian
age. These soils are located on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial plains and alluvial plain remnants
(Daigle 1995; NRCS 2017).

HYDROLOGY

Within the Lake Wichita project area, there are two named drainages (Holliday and Pecan Creeks) that flow
from southwest to northeast and two unnamed tributaries that flow from north to south into the reservoir.
All of these drainages are tributaries of Holliday Creek, which itself eventually intersects the Wichita River
downstream from Lake Wichita (see Figure A.1). The tributary drainages in approaching Lake Wichita are
dendritically spread across the uplands and are primarily composed of intermittent channels.
The most prominent drainage emptying into Lake Wichita is Holliday Creek, as mentioned previously, is a
tributary of the Wichita River within the Red River basin. The Red River basin is the fourth largest in Texas
(30,740 square miles), while the Red River stretches over 1,360 miles long across a significant portion of
north Texas (Huser 2000; Kleiner 2017). Holliday Creek is a competent drainage that has its headwaters
about 22 miles west of Lake Wichita near Dundee, Texas in western Archer County (Figure A.3). From its
beginning elevation of 1,150 feet amsl, Holliday Creek gradually descends roughly 170 feet at its
intersection with Lake Wichita. This descent is a roughly 7.5-foot elevation drop per mile or 0.15 percent
slope. On its approach to Lake Wichita, Holliday Creek has a sinuosity ratio of 1.35, which indicates a
sinuous channel. This sinuosity suggests a moderately dynamic depositional history, where the channel in
this area has moved laterally. In this type of setting, the lateral movement can significantly erode the
deposits of outside meander bends and, in contrast, deposit significant amounts of sediment upon interior
meanders (Charlton 2008). However, Holliday Creek on its approach to Lake Wichita is an anastomosing
channel consisting of multiple, parallel channels. Holliday Creek as an anastomosing channel suggests a
dissipated flow likely from the low gradient (i.e., 0.15 percent slope) and high silt or clay content in the
alluvium (Charlton 2008; Knighton 1998). A consequence of the dissipated, low energy flow of this setting

is that overbank flooding is limited and deep alluvial deposits are not commonly present from the recent
past. Rather, when flooding occurs in the channel, the surge is “flashy” and spread widely. This is supported
by the wide drainage valley (1,200–1,400 feet) that contains the active Holliday Creek as it approaches
Lake Wichita.
Pecan Creek is the second most prominent drainage of Lake Wichita. The headwaters of Pecan Creek is
roughly 5.75 miles southwest of the reservoir in northern Archer County. From its beginning elevation of
1,015 feet amsl, Pecan Creek gradually descends roughly 35 feet to its intersection with Lake Wichita, or
roughly 6-foot elevation drop per mile (0.12 percent slope). On its approach to Lake Wichita, Pecan Creek
has a sinuosity ratio of 1.28, which indicates a sinuous channel. As with Holliday Creek, this sinuosity
suggests a moderately dynamic depositional history, where the channel in this area has moved laterally and
can significantly erode the deposits of outside meander bends or deposit significant amounts of sediment
upon interior meanders (Charlton 2008). In contrast to Holliday Creek, Pecan Creek is not an anastomosing
channel and has only one channel. Notably, Pecan Creek, near its terminus at Lake Wichita, has a
confluence with a small tributary. These two drainages appear to create an alluvial fan.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

To date, no intensive geomorphological or geoarchaeological investigations have been conducted in or near
Lake Wichita. A cultural resources investigation was conducted in 2007 on Holliday Creek, roughly 6.5
miles downstream from Lake Wichita. These investigations, conducted by AR Consultants, examined a 9acre area on the right bank (east side) of Holliday Creek for a proposed development project (Todd 2007).
The investigations encountered heavy disturbance within the project area from the channelization of
Holliday Creek in the 1970s and subsequent vegetation removal in the area (Todd 2007). Notably, the 2007
investigations observed a paucity of previous, systematic archaeological investigations in the region, citing
only one other study in 1980 by Environment Consultants in Wichita Falls, Texas, along the Wichita River
(Todd 2007:5–6).
The most pertinent geomorphological study conducted in proximity to the Lake Wichita project area is the
examination of the geoarchaeology of TxDOT’s Fort Worth and Wichita Falls Districts (Abbott 2011;
Abbott and Pletka 2014). The Fort Worth District predictive model encompasses nine counties (i.e., Erath,
Hood, Jack, Johnson, Palo Pinto, Parker, Somervell, Tarrant, and Wise) and includes a focus on the
Quaternary stratigraphy of depositional systems (drainages) in the area, as well as identifying the potential
for archaeological sites in different landscapes (Abbott 2011). Although Abbott’s (2011) study begins
roughly 30 miles south of Lake Wichita, some elements of the predictive model applies to the current
investigations at Lake Wichita. Relevant to the current Lake Wichita study, Abbott (2011:16–23) examined
the soil series for the Fort Worth District and identified the geoarchaeological potential for each series to
preserve archaeological sites. Simply put, the predictive model (among other things) focuses on the
landscape and past environments to determine what areas and deposits have an elevated probability of
preserving archaeological sites. A distinction is made by Abbott (2011:155) that the model regards the
integrity of a deposit and not behavioral (i.e., cultural actions). Abbott (2011) ranks the geoarchaeological
potential of each soil series from Low to Very High. Several of the soil series (i.e., Winters, Tillman, Port,
and Wheatwood) identified in Lake Wichita are geographically related (i.e., comparable) to some of the
soils examined during the geoarchaeological predictive modeling (Abbott 2011). Specifically, the Winters
and Tillman soil series are geographically similar to the Wichita and Vernon soil series (NRCS 2017).
Abbott (2011) interprets these soil series as having a low potential for containing archaeological deposits.
Further, the Port and Wheatwood soil series are geographically similar to the Gaddy, Weswood, and Yahola
soil series (NRCS 2017). These soils are interpreted as having a high to very high potential for containing
archaeological sites (Abbott 2011:16–23).

Specific to Lake Wichita, the geoarchaeological predictive model for TxDOT’s Wichita Falls District was
also examined (Figures A.4 and A.5). Not surprisingly, the Wichita Falls predictive model identified the
areas containing the aforementioned Port and Wheatwood soil series as having a high potential for
geoarchaeological integrity (Abbott and Pletka 2014). Notably, however, a large section of the Lake
Wichita project area was denoted as having a negligible geoarchaeological potential, due to the mapped
water levels of the reservoir.

A.6

RESULTS OF THE GEOMORPHIC ASSESSMENT

A geomorphic assessment of the Lake Wichita project area was conducted in January and February 2017.
These investigations examined the various settings and landforms within and adjacent to the reservoir. The
inspection of the Lake Wichita project area was conducted by reviewing U.S. Geological Survey
topographic quadrangle maps, examining soil and geologic maps, and hydrology data. Further, historic
aerial and topographic maps were reviewed in an attempt to determine the amount of alterations to the
landscape in and around Lake Wichita. However, this avenue of research proved unproductive, since the
age of Lake Wichita’s impoundment (1901) predated aerial photography and the scale of historic
topographic maps were too large to get adequate resolution to identify changes in elevation.
The geomorphic assessment of Lake Wichita identified three landforms across the project area (i.e.,
uplands, slopes–valley margins, and lowlands). Each of these areas are described below and have varying
potential for containing intact archaeological sites.
As the name implies, the uplands compose the ridges and elevated land surrounding Lake Wichita and are
currently covered in residential and commercial development and associated improvements (e.g., roads).
Generally, the uplands occupy the areas with an elevation of 990 feet amsl or greater. Overall, the upland
setting is absent of deposits capable of burying cultural resources. Any prehistoric or historic cultural
materials in the uplands would likely be a palimpsest, situated at either the surface or near the ground
surface (less than 30 cmbs). This region of the project area is interpreted to have a low to absent potential
for containing intact, buried cultural resources.
The slopes-valley margins landform is the transitional zone between the uplands and lowland areas of Lake
Wichita. The slopes-valley margins drape the base of the uplands, and form bands that encircle some of the
tributary drainages that cross the uplands. This setting is situated approximately between elevations of 980
to 990 feet amsl. Overall, the slopes-valley margin setting has limited deposits capable of burying cultural
resources. Any prehistoric or historic cultural materials in this setting would likely be at the surface, but
may also be shallowly buried by colluvial processes. Any buried cultural material would be less than 30
cmbs. This region of the project area is interpreted to have a low potential for containing buried cultural
resources.
The final setting, the lowlands, consists of generally level floodplains and alluvial fans, which range in
elevation from roughly 980 feet amsl or lower. In particular, the lowland areas are centered around Holliday
Creek on the west end of Lake Wichita, an unnamed tributary on the north side of Lake Wichita, and Pecan
Creek on the south end of Lake Wichita. These areas have the most potential for having deep sediments
capable of burying any archaeological sites that may be present. Any prehistoric or historic cultural
materials in this setting could be buried from either alluvial or colluvial processes and range from the
surface to greater than 2 meters below surface. Furthermore, there is a recorded incidence of buried soils
occurring in some pedons of the Port and Wheatwood soil series below 30 inches (NRCS 2017). If these
buried soils are present, then any cultural materials found in them are likely intact and significant.
In February 2017, a series of auger probes were excavated along portions of the Lake Wichita project area.
These auger probe excavations were conducted in an attempt to identify the presence of the recorded buried

SWCA Environmental Consultants

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Lake Wichita Shoreline, Wichita and Archer Counties, Texas

soil of the Port and Wheatwood soil series within the project area (Figure A.6). Six auger probes (AP1–6)
were placed across HPA 13 as this area appears the most probable to contain any buried soils that may be
present within the project area (Figure A.7). These probes ranged in depth from a minimum of 67 cmbs
(AP2) to a maximum of 354 cmbs (AP4), but generally exceeded 200 cmbs (Table A.1). The water table
was encountered in all of the auger probes typically around 140 to 160 cmbs, but was observed as shallow
as 63 cmbs and as deep as 200 cmbs. Due to the saturated nature of the lowermost deposits that were the
focus of the investigations, matrix samples were collected from select auger probes (AP3 and AP4). The
matrix from these auger probes were subsequently air dried and examined in the laboratory.
With few variations, the deposits in the auger probes were very similar. Typically, the surface horizon
extended to 11 cmbs and consists of a brown-strong brown (7.5YR4/3–5/6) sandy clay loam with a friablefirm consistency; subangular blocky structure, fine-medium size, and weak grade; inclusions included
roots-rootlets (10%) and insect burrows (1–3%). Below this stratum is a dark brown (7.5YR3/3) sandy
clay loam with a friable consistency; subangular blocky structure, medium size, and weak grade; inclusions
include rootlets (5%) and insect burrows (3%). The third stratum begins around 30 cmbs and consists of a
brown-strong brown (7.5YR4/4–4/6) sandy clay loam with a firm consistency; subangular blocky parting
to angular blocky structure, medium size, and weak-moderate grade; inclusions included rootlets (<2%)
and insect burrows (<1%). Below this beginning around 65 cmbs is the fourth stratum containing brown
(7.5YR5/4) sandy clay loam to sandy clay with a friable consistency; subangular blocky structure, mediumcoarse size, and moderate grade; inclusions consist of rootlets (<1%), insect burrows (<1%), manganese
nodules 1 to 2 mm in diameter (1%), and reddish brown (7.5YR6/8) mottles 2 to 5 mm in size (<2%)
attributed to redoximorphic features from the frequently saturated soils. The fifth stratum typically begins
at 141 cmbs and consists of brown (7.5YR5/3–5/4) sandy clay loam to sandy clay with a friable to firm
consistency; subangular blocky structure, medium-coarse size, and moderate grade; inclusions consist of
rootlets (<1%), insect burrows (<1%), manganese nodules 1 mm in diameter (2%), small 2 cm vertical
cracks (<2%), and white (7.5YR8/1) mottles 1 mm in size (<2%) that could be calcium carbonate (CaCo3).
Beginning at roughly 220 cmbs, the sixth horizon consists of a brown to strong brown (7.5YR5/4–5/6)
sandy clay with a firm consistency; angular blocky structure, medium size, and moderate grade; inclusions
consist of manganese nodules 2 to 3 mm (3–5%), and white mottling 1 mm (<2%). Finally, the lowest
stratum encountered begins at roughly 330 cmbs and consists of light brown to reddish brown (7.5YR6/4–
6/6) sandy clay with a firm consistency; angular blocky structure, medium size, and strong grade; inclusions
consist of manganese nodules 1 to 2 mm (2%), and white mottling 1 to 3 mm (3%). Notably, the white
mottling observed in several of the lower strata reacted violently with hydrochloric acid and quickly
dissolved. The white mottles appear to be CaCO3 filaments.
The encountered strata in the auger probes does not appear to correlate with the soil pedons described for
the Port or Wheatwood soil series. As described above, the Port and Wheatwood soil series contain very
deep silt loams formed in calcareous loamy alluvium. The deposits along HPA 13 in the auger probes
exclusively encountered sandy clay loams and sandy clay. The deposits in the auger probes most closely
correlate with that attributed to the Winters soil series (NRCS 2017). Further, no evidence of the reported
buried A horizon (i.e., paleosols) was observed during these investigations. The deposits composing the
alluvial fan adjacent to Lake Wichita (HPA 13) appear to be Winters loam soil series. As previously
mentioned, the Winters soil series is geographically similar to the Wichita and Vernon soil series that is
interpreted as having a low potential for containing archaeological deposits (Abbott 2011).

A.7

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The geomorphic assessment of the Lake Wichita project area has identified three settings with varying
potential to contain buried cultural materials. Although cultural materials may be present in the upland and
slopes-valley margin settings, there is a very low potential for deeply buried cultural materials. The lowland
setting is interpreted to have a high potential for containing deep cultural deposits. This setting has

considerable soil deposits that could contain cultural materials that may contain strata dating back to the
Late Pleistocene. Accordingly, any archaeological sites in these deposits could reach from the Paleoindian
through historic periods. Based upon these interpretations, the proper method of survey for each of these
settings would be different:
•

The upland setting of the Lake Wichita project area could be effectively evaluated with pedestrian
survey and limited (i.e., judgmental) shovel testing. The shovel test excavations in this setting
would target areas that may have some soil deposits.

•

Similarly, the slopes-valley margins setting could adequately be evaluated by pedestrian survey
with systematic shovel testing, particularly along drainage margins and where colluvial drape may
have created deeper soil deposits. These areas correlate with the previously identified HPAs (see
Figure A.1), in addition to these areas are locations noted as having High Geoarchaeological
Potential and are in proximity to HPA01, HPA09, and HPA13 (see Figures A.4 and A.5).

•

The lowland areas indicated as HPAs are recommended for investigation with pedestrian survey
and systematic shovel test excavations (see Figure A.1). The High Geoarchaeological Potential
areas are recommended to be investigated with pedestrian survey and selective auger probing (see
Figures A.4 and A.5). The auger probing is recommended to be utilized to identify the presence
(and depth) of any cultural materials or the buried A Horizon indicated for the Port and Wheatwood
soils. In the event that the buried A horizon be identified in the High Geoarchaeological Potential
areas, then deep mechanical investigations (i.e., backhoe excavation) are recommended to more
fully examine the relevant strata for the presence of cultural materials.

Notably, only one area identified as having a High Geoarchaeological Potential was within the APE of the
Lake Wichita project. This area is HPA 13, which was investigated with auger probe investigations. The
results of the auger probing within the lowland area HPA 13 did not encounter Port and Wheatwood soils
or the associated buried soil. Rather, these investigations extending to over 350 cmbs and encountered soils
of the Winters soil series. As a consequence, no deep mechanical investigations are recommended for this
area. However, should the APE of the project be altered to extend outward from the currently proposed
project, then further investigations are recommended with pedestrian survey and selective auger probing.
