ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists completed an intensive linear 100 percent pedestrian archeological
survey for the proposed Howard Lane Extension Phase II project located in eastern Travis County, Texas.
The survey was conducted for Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the City of Austin and Travis County for
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance. Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) under ACT Permit #5585. The proposed west-east roadway extension measures
approximately 1.62 miles (2.6 kilometers) in length, beginning at the intersection of Cameron Road and
Howard Lane and ending at SH130. The facility will utilize a maximum right-of-way (ROW) width of
114 feet, equating to a 22.5-acre impact/survey area. Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the proposed
roadway extension on foot. The survey consisted of pedestrian inspection supplemented by shovel testing
(n=17) and mechanical trench excavations (n=4) within the proposed project’s footprint, which generally
runs west to east. The survey corridor was found to be largely undeveloped, open farm and it is cultivated
rangeland with deep dense clays that had, in areas, moderate inundation and surface water as a result of
recent rains. The survey was negative for archeological resources. Hicks & Company recommends that
the proposed undertaking has minimal potential to impact State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and
should be allowed to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. Since this survey resulted in
no sites being identified, all project-generated notes, forms, and photographs will be retained at Hicks &
Company in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Executive Summary

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On behalf of Jacobs Engineering for the City of Austin and Travis County, Hicks & Company completed
a 100 percent intensive linear archeological survey along approximately 1.62 miles (2.6 km) of a
proposed extension of Howard Lane in eastern Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed
construction will consist of entirely new location roadway extending east from Howard Lane’s current
intersection at Cameron Road to State Highway (SH) 130 approximately a half-mile south of Gregg
Manor Road. The roadway will consist of an entirely new four-lane facility with two 12-foot-wide travel
lanes for each direction with 1.5-foot interior curbs and gutters and two-foot exterior curbs and gutters.
The facility will also include a 20-foot-wide median, a five-foot-wide bike lane, and a six-foot-wide
sidewalk on either side of the road. To complete this project, the City/County requires a maximum rightof-way width of 114 feet. The extension will cover 1.62 miles of relatively undisturbed land for a total of
22.5 acres of impacts. Exact depths of impact have not been confirmed, though roadway projects of this
nature generally impact the upper two to three feet of sediment; however, since the alignment will cross
Gilleland Creek, it has been determined that a bridge structure with deeply-installed bridge piers will be
required. Construction will take place on land to be owned and controlled by the City of Austin or Travis
County, depending on location, and is therefore subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The
entire project also requires a City of Austin Environmental Assessment; however, the project does not
involve any federal funding or permitting and therefore does not require compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. This project was previously coordinated
with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) through a letter dated February 17, 2010, with
recommendations for intensive archeological survey and backhoe trenching with THC concurrence on
March 11, 2010 (Appendix B).
Investigations were conducted under ACT Permit #5585 in accordance with the THC/Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) guidelines for intensive linear survey. Investigations involved a combination of
pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing and backhoe trench excavations to identify and
evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits within the proposed project area.
Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the proposed Howard Lane roadway extension on foot. A total of
17 shovel tests and four backhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. The backhoe trenches
were placed at opportunistic locations on terraces located at the intersection of the project alignment and
Gilleland Creek (Appendix A). The survey corridor was found to be largely undeveloped, open
farm/rangeland with deep dense clays. At the time of the pedestrian survey certain areas were inundated
with surface water as result of recent rains. The archeological survey conformed to the THC’s minimum
standards for intensive linear archeological investigations, using a combination of backhoe trenching,
shovel testing, and surface inspection. The archeological survey was negative for archeological
resources.
Fieldwork for the archeological survey occurred during March of 2010, requiring approximately 41 manhours to complete. Report production immediately followed conclusion of fieldwork. Mason Miller

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Geology and Soils
The proposed roadway will cross gently- to moderately-sloping rangeland with drainage into Gilleland
Creek near its confluence with Harris Branch. According to the Austin Sheet of the Geological Atlas of
Texas, the area is underlain by Navarro and Taylor Groups undivided (Knt) of the Upper Cretaceous (also
referred to as “upper Taylor marl”). The formation is calcareous, clayey, light- to medium-gray and
brown with a thickness of approximately 600 feet. Intermittent portions of the alignment are underlain by
Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qhg) of the Pleistocene, a high gravel deposit found on terraces along streams.
Soils within the project area consist of Houston Black clay (HnB) and Heiden clay (HeC2), comprising 37
percent and 34 percent of the project area, respectively. Houston Black clay is described as a residuum
weathered from calcareous shale of Taylor marl and Eagleford shale and is a relatively deep soil, reaching
a depth of at least 80 inches before terminating at bedrock. Heiden clay is described as a clayey residuum
weathered from clayey shale of Eagleford or Taylor marl. It consists of clay to approximately 50 inches
before transitioning to silty clay to termination at a depth of at least 80 inches below the surface. Austin
silty clay (AsC2) occurs along ridges within the project area (comprising approximately 15 percent of the
soils) and is a residuum weathered from chalk. Shallower than Houston Black and Heiden clays, it
generally reaches a depth of 40 inches before bedrock. Archeological sites in these soil contexts are
generally found on the ground surface or shallowly-buried. The remaining soil within the project area is
classified as Tinn clay, a Holocene age-derived clayey alluvium from mixed sources. Found in the
project area only along the floodplains of Gilleland Creek, Tinn clay reaches a depth of 80 inches.
Archeological sites in this soil may be found either shallowly- or deeply-buried, resulting in an increased
potential for preservation.

Flora and Fauna
The project area occurs in the vicinity of the Blackland Prairies ecological region of Texas. The
Blackland Prairies region encompasses approximately 11,500,000 acres of nearly level to rolling prairies
and grasslands, interspersed with dense woodlands. The region forms a broad wedge between the
Edwards Plateau and Cross Timbers and Prairies to the west, and the Post Oak Savannah to the east, with
which it intermingles.
Historically, the region was classified as tall grass prairie, dominated by various native grasses including
little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper var. asper), and
Silveus dropseed (Sporobolus silveanus). Of these, Little bluestem was the climax dominant.
Approximately 98 percent of the Blackland Prairies has been cultivated. Isolated, dense groves of
deciduous trees and shrubs, including hackberry (Celtis spp.), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana),

Environmental Setting

oak (Quercus spp.), elm (Ulmus spp.), pecan (Carya illinoensis), and eastern cottonwood (Populus
deltoides) are present on hills and ridges, and in bottomlands. Most of the region has been cultivated or
grazed, with very few areas of native vegetation remaining. With increased grazing pressure and
cultivation, non-native species such as coastal Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) and King Ranch
bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) have invaded substantially and are dominant grasses in many
locations. Many sites have also seen the spread of various woody species including mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), huisache (Acacia smallii), elm, oak, and hackberry.
The project area includes small wooded areas, mixed grassland, and farmland. Vegetation other than
cropland that would be expected in the area according to mapping conducted by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (McMahan et al. 1984) would include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium),
sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), three-awn (Aristida spp.),
hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides),
windmillgrass (Chloris spp.), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus paniculatus), western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), Texas bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis), live oak
(Quercus virginiana), post oak (Quercus stellata), and mesquite.
Common species occurring within the river and creek drainages include pecan, cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry, cottonwood, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis)
and black willow (Salix nigra). Invasion by mesquite, false willow (Baccharis spp.) and non-native
ligustrum (Ligustrum spp.) is also evident. Characteristic understory shrubs and vines include saw
greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), yaupon, (Ilex vomitoria), bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa), grape (Vitis spp.)
and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).
A high diversity of fish and wildlife is known to exist in central Texas and Travis County. According to
county records maintained by Texas A&M University (2009), amphibians and reptiles are represented by
five species of salamanders, 21 species of frogs and toads, eight species of turtles, eleven different kinds
of skinks and lizards, 27 different snakes and the American alligator. Texas Tech University (2008) has
documented at least 60 species of mammals in this region, while 471 bird species have been documented
within the oaks and prairies region that includes eastern Travis County (TPWD 2003).
Commonly occurring mammal species that would be expected in the project area include but are not
limited to: coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus),
eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Common reptile species include
the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), collared lizard
(Crotaphytus collaris), checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and water snake (Nerodia
erythrogaster). Frequent bird species would include Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos),
Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), House Sparrow (Passer
domesticus), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), White-winged Dove (Zenaida asiatica), Mourning
Dove (Zenaida macroura), American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo

jamaicensis), Red-shouldered Hawk (Buteo lineatus), Cooper’s Hawk (Accipiter cooperii), Great Horned
Owl (Bubo virginianus), gray phase of the Eastern Screech Owl (Otus asio), Barred Owl (Strix varia),
Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), Great-tailed Grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), Turkey Vulture
(Cathartes aura), and Black Vulture (Coragyps atratus).
The climate of Travis County is considered humid subtropical, characterized by hot summers and cool
winters, with an average low temperature in January of 38 degrees Fahrenheit and an average high
temperature in July of 96 degrees. Annual average precipitation is 81 centimeters (32 inches), with peak
precipitation in May and September. Summers are generally dry with occasional thunderstorms.

Land Use
The project area runs west to east, crossing Gilleland Creek and its various tributaries at certain locations
(Figure 1). The project begins at the intersection of Howard Lane (its Phase I extension is nearing
completion) and Cameron Road (Figure 2). From this location, the project travels through cow pastures
and isolated stands of mesquite in low elevation areas that, during the time of the survey, had intermittent
pockets of standing surface water (Figures 3 and 4). From here, the project alignment crosses open
undulating cow pasture and modified/terraced fields that generally grades upwards as one travels east
(Figure 5). From its highpoint, the project gradually descends, crossing under a power line (Figure 6),
before intersecting a fence line that separates pastureland from a fallow agricultural field. On the eastern
end of this agricultural field the project alignment crosses the main branch of Gilleland Creek (Figure 7)
where it grades upward across overgrown pastureland before reaching Hill Lane, a semi-private gravel
road. East of Hill Lane the project alignment crosses another fallow agricultural field before terminating
at its intersection with SH130 (Figure 8).

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Archeological Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas Archeological Region. Most of the recent
chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct time periods, roughly representing a 12,000 year
sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the culture-historical sequences provided by Collins (2004) and
Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800-5800 BP), Middle
Archaic (5800-4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000-1400 BP) and Post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric (AD 600­
1600), and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions represent convenient temporal
categories, they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in
changes in lithic and other technologies.

Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in South and Central Texas is believed to be related to the well-known big
game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the well documented early Paleoindian
sites in Texas that are associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of Central Texas on
the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In general, early Paleoindian sites are
scarce in Central Texas or at least not as visible as later sites. Conversely, later Paleoindian sites are
much more numerous in South and Central Texas, although both are usually identified from only surfacecollected artifacts (Black and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several late Paleoindian sites does
suggest, however, that small game was being exploited rather than extinct megafauna. This data supports
the idea that a hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of Southwest
and Central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas have typically been associated with lanceolate projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff (Turner
and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235) (Collins 2004), equate
three styles of projectiles, Golondrina/Barber, St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson to the Late Paleoindian period.
The Wilson component is dated at 10,000 to 9650 BP and is associated with features, a burial and artifacts
that are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from this site further
suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continues during the ensuing the Golondrina/Barber and
St. Mary’s Hall components. These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.

Cultural Background

Early Archaic (ca. 8800 - 5800 BP)
The Early Archaic period is subdivided into three projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split
Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to 6000 BP (Collins 2004). Generally, the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in technology focused on the use of
burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods. This shift is traced back as early as 8800 BP at the WilsonLeonard site and at roughly comparable ages at several other Central Texas sites (Decker et al. 1999;
Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, evidence for the use of earth ovens and burned rock technologies for
the possible processing of plant foods is associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points. Hence,
the use of Angostura and late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the Early
Archaic period for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base split-stem and
Martindale/Uvalde styles.
The Early Archaic marks the shift to the use of multiple tons of burned limestone and other rocks in the
form of scatters, hearths, middens and other features for the heated processing of plant foods. This
represents the start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition which lasted from roughly 8800 to 1400 BP.
This tradition was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the resulting creation of
burned rock middens at strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence practices began with a
distinctive cooking technology using layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens which allowed
for the exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic plants like sotol
(Dasylibion texanun) and other species such as Lily family onion bulbs which grow in wetter
environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool late Pleistocene
environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most pronounced during
the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000-7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests
that the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene and early
Holocene/Paleoindian period witnessed a brief dry interval during Late Paleoindian times, which later
again became more mesic during the ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the
Early Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994), or a more mesic
interval within an overall, long lived trend towards aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears
that the use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related
processing began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests that the Early Archaic occupations
were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations
for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations. Broad spectrum and well adapted, highly
mobile subsistence strategies are theorized. Regional population density may have been low, though this
may reflect a sampling bias in terms of well documented Early Archaic sites (Ricklis and Collins 1994).

Cultural Background

Middle Archaic (ca. 5800 - 4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to process plant and
other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a
pronounced mid-Holocene drying event which occurred from 7000 to 5000 BP, but which may have
lasted longer. Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval along the eastern Edwards
Plateau from roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this is the cessation of significant overbank
sediment aggradation at a number of Central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions catalyzed
extensive downcutting and erosion along many Central Texas streams. Hypothetically, dry conditions
would have promoted the spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the increased use of
burned rock middens. Dryer conditions may also have engendered the return of bison to the plateau
during the Middle and Late Archaic periods. The proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point
styles at the beginning of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return of bison to the Edwards
Plateau and the adjacent Blackland Prairie. Within archeological literature, these broad bladed points
have been associated the exploitation of bison. Additional Middle Archaic projectile point styles include
Early Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and Travis.

Late Archaic (ca 4000 - 1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic interval into two different
subperiods, I and II (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile
points, which along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell) were used to hunt
bison and other large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late Archaic I
interval. The resources processed utilizing burned rock technology may have included yucca (yucca sp.),
sotol, and perhaps lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla). Other middens may simply be dumps for kitchen type
debris which contain sizeable quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus
(Johnson 1995). Pedernales peoples, in particular, may have been adept at both hunting and the
processing of large volumes of plant food materials.
The Late Archaic II interval (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of increasingly mesic conditions
for all but the western and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of
more mesic conditions may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic (dry-weather
adapted) plants and perhaps bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced adjustments in prehistoric
subsistence strategies. There appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can be
directly attributable to the Late Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller and
are characterized by such styles as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. Evidence that the large projectiles well
adapted to bison hunting may have been gradually replaced. Also, it has been posited that the spread of
Eastern Woodland religious cults may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of Central
Texas (Johnson 1995).

Cultural Background

Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600 - 1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is marked
initially by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from
dart points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the
bow and arrow, there is every indication that the broad based hunting-gathering economy of the Late
Archaic persisted into and through most of the Late Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is
marked by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem
Perdiz arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives, and
drills or perforators made on flakes and blades. The Post-Archaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid
towards the middle of the Late Prehistoric, during which there was a rather dramatic increase in the bison
exploitation. It appears that bison hunting became an increasingly important economic activity during the
later part of this period.

Historic Period (AD 1528 – Present)
The most radical changes in the Native American history of Central Texas came during the historic era
(Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North America by Spanish settlers in the sixteenth century.
Nomadic groups, initially the Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted the horse and rapidly altered the
aboriginal situation of Central Texas. These nomadic groups entered Central Texas from the plains and
mountain areas to the north and west and within 150 years had forced most of the native peoples to flee.
Most groups were simply destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the foreign
diseases introduced by the Europeans. Others moved south, entering Spanish missions and settlements, or
eastward to join various agricultural groups such as the Wichita (Black 1989).
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nuzñez Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors
of the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528, although there may have been earlier landings
(Cecil and Greene 2001). In any case, the influences of European colonization were not felt strongly in
Texas until several centuries later. By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the Spanish had
established missions in east Texas and settlements in south Texas. This resulted in massive depopulation
and cultural disintegration among native Indian groups.
The majority of archeological sites in the Manor vicinity of eastern Travis County are historic farmsteads
relating to the settlement and agriculture of the Manor area, which was founded in the 1850s but whose
major period of settlement occurred after the Houston and Central Texas Railway was built through it in
1871, with a stop in town (Smyrl 1996). Not surprisingly, these historic sites appear to conform to the
general dispersion pattern observed by Clark (2004). Settlement in the Blackland Prairies during the
nineteenth century tended to cluster along roads and other transportation arteries. Farmsteads were
typically located near a reliable water source and houses were situated on hills overlooking creeks or
springs.

Previous Recorded Sites and Investigations

PREVIOUS RECORDED SITES AND INVESTIGATIONS
Background information was gathered using the THC’s Online Sites Atlas (the Atlas) in order to
determine if any previously recorded archeological sites exist within one kilometer of the proposed
alignment. The review determined four archeological sites were documented within the project area
along with nine previously recorded sites just outside the one-kilometer boundary (Appendix A).
Furthermore, the Atlas shows five previously conducted archeological surveys were completed within or
adjacent to the proposed alignment, while two cemeteries have been recorded within one kilometer of the
project area (Table 1).
The largest areal survey within the project area was conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) in 1989. The survey begins at the westernmost portion of the project area
and encompasses the majority of the alignment. The survey overlaps Site 41TV1419, a historic house site
with two associated cisterns recorded in 1988 approximately 600 meters from the proposed alignment.
Recorders did not recommend the site as eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). The survey completed by HUD encompasses three
more sites within a kilometer and a half of the alignment, each of which was recorded as a historic house
site, none of which were found to be eligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL. In 1995, just north of
the survey completed by HUD, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted an areal survey during which no sites were recorded, as
well as a linear survey along Cameron Road, marking the western boundary of the project’s proposed
alignment. Six previously recorded archeological sites are situated just west of the Cameron Road
survey, including Site 41TV88. Referred to as the Pat Parker Site, recorders in 1960 described it as a
burial site dating to the Austin Phase of the Late Prehsitoric. Limited information regarding site specifics
is available, though artifacts were collected and sent to various laboratories for further study. The site
was not listed for any further work, nor is it listed in the NRHP or as an SAL. The five other sites
adjacent to the Cameron Road survey are located immediately outside the project area and are described
as two historic house sites, two prehistoric open campsites/lithic scatters, and one multi-component
historic and prehistoric site. None of these were recorded as eligible for listing in the NRHP or as an
SAL.
Site 41TV1739 was recorded in 1995 and is described as a prehistoric open campsite approximately 185
meters from the proposed alignment. It was not recommended for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL,
though it was recorded in the same year as an adjacent, unknown survey that loosely parallels the
proposed alignment (likely conducted in preparation for the Lower Colorado River Authority’s McNeilBastrop electrical transmission line). The eastern boundary of the proposed alignment abuts a survey
conducted by TxDOT/FHWA in association with SH 130 construction in 2001. Approximately 375
meters east of this survey is Site 41TV1893, also recorded in 2001 as a historic midden ineligible for
listing in the NRHP or as an SAL. Finally, Site 41TV1977, a historic house site, was recorded just south
of the project area. Site 41TV1977 was not recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP or as a

SAL. Two cemeteries are located within one kilometer of the project area, though neither is directly
intersected by the alignment. Gregg Cemetery is located approximately 300 meters north of the western
terminus of the project area, while Hill Cemetery is located about 700 meters north of the eastern portion
of the alignment, approximately 400 meters west of the intersection of Gregg Manor Road and Hill Lane.
Recently, Hicks & Company conducted a survey for the Harris Branch Wastewater Interceptor line
located approximately 950 meters south of the project area. During this survey, archeologists with Hicks
& Company encountered and recorded Site 41TV2373, a historic well. This site was not considered
eligible for listing with the NRHP or as a SAL.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
Pedestrian survey followed the THC/CTA’s standards for intensive linear investigations and consisted of
two transects within the proposed project corridor (13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy). In areas that were
not previously surveyed, shovel tests were distributed at approximately 100-meter (300-foot) intervals
within each transect. Within areas that had been previously surveyed (the western half of the project
corridor), shovel tests were distributed at approximately 200-meter intervals along each transect. At two
locations, fallow agricultural fields were encountered that exhibited 100 percent visibility in contexts that
did not suggest deep site burial. These areas were visually inspected and photographed but not shovel
tested. All shovel tests were terminated at a maximum depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface
unless pre-Holocene deposits, bedrock, or extremely dense clay was encountered. Frequently, within the
survey corridor, archeologists encountered dense, wet clays that inhibited testing beyond. All excavated
soil from shovel tests was screened through ¼-inch wire mesh or hand sorted where clays could not be
screened. Each shovel test was recorded in ten-centimeter levels on standardized forms and plotted onto a
site sketch map and/or an aerial photograph of the project area. Once test data were recorded, all of the
shovel tests were backfilled. Areas of disturbance were noted and recorded through photographs and field
notes. No sites were encountered therefore site specific investigation was not employed.
Backhoe trench excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in order to locate and
expose cultural features or occupation levels within areas exhibiting the potential for site burial. Within
the project area, deep quaternary-age alluvial sediments were mapped along the Gilleland Creek
floodplain. At these locales, backhoe trenches were excavated to the discernible ancient sterile clays, or
the water table, typically around 220-250 centimeters below the surface. Backhoe excavations were
directed and monitored by an archeologist certified as a competent person trained in Occupational Safety
and Health Association (OSHA) trench safety standards. Sediment from approximately every ten
centimeter level (approximately one of every four bucket passes) was screened through ¼-inch wire
mesh. Each backhoe trench was recorded on a standardized form with notes made for stratigraphy,
features, and cultural artifacts. A soil profile, plan view map, and photographs were recorded for each
trench as warranted. After these data were recorded, the backhoe trenches were backfilled.
Investigators used a Trimble GeoExplorer XT GPS unit and detailed maps to locate and record
excavations within the proposed project area. GPS positions were recorded for all shovel tests and
backhoe trenches. All GPS positions were downloaded and plotted on 7.5 minute USGS topographic
maps and aerial photographs by Hicks & Company Geographic Information Systems (GIS) personnel.

Results of Investigations

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Investigators began surveying at the western project terminus, at the project’s intersection with Cameron
Road, and proceeded east. The westernmost section of the project runs just north of and parallel to an
existing power line through low-lying pastureland that is intermittently populated by stands of mesquite
(Figure 2 and 3). Shovel tests were placed at irregular intervals in this area due to the presence of
intermittent pockets of surface water (Figure 9). Additionally, this area of the project had been
previously surveyed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1989. Shovel
tests revealed thick, dark, dense soils that ranged in color from very dark gray (10 YR 3/1) to dark
yellowish brown (10 YR 3/4) and were terminated at depths from 29 to 50 centimeters below ground
surface (cmbgs) at impenetrable, sterile subsoils.

Figure 9: Ground conditions in western portion of project area.
Moving east from the low lying pasture/mesquite stands the project alignment grades upward along a
series of modified and manicured terraces (Figure 10). Because this upland area of the project had been
previously surveyed, shovel tests in this area where placed regularly at 200 meter intervals. Shovel tests
in this area revealed dense, heavy, upland clays and clay loams that ranged in color from very dark gray
(10 YR 3/1) to dark brown (10 YR 3/3). Shovel tests were terminated due to the presence of impenetrable
and sterile clay/clay loam subsoil at depths of 30-40 cmbgs.

Results of Investigations

Figure 10: Terraced field.
From the upland rise/terraced area, the project drops again in elevation where, east of a fence line, the
land transitions into a plowed agricultural field for an approximate distance of 400 meters. Here, the
project alignment crosses the main branch of Gilleland Creek. At the time the survey was conducted, this
area was largely covered by standing surface water as a result of recent rains (Figure 11). However,
because this field was fallow, surface visibility was near 100 percent and this portion of the project
corridor, although not shovel tested, was surveyed on foot. Within this area, near the project alignment’s
intersection with Gilleland Creek two trenches (discussed below) were excavated to asses the terraces’
potential of containing buried archeological deposits.
The terrace bank east of Gilleland Creek was found to be higher in elevation than the west bank and
considerably less inundated with standing water. Shovel tests conducted approximately 20 meters east of
Gilleland Creek revealed thick clay loams that were predominantly brown (10 YR 4/3) in color with
yellowish brown (10 YR 5/6) mottling that increased with depth. At 120-160 meters from Gilleland
Creek, thick clays were encountered that ranged from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to black (10
YR 2/1) At 200 meters east of Gilleland Creek shovel tests revealed dense black (10YR 2/1) clays. All
shovel tests in this area were terminated from between 35-65 cmbgs at impenetrable, thick, sterile clay.
Continuing east, crossing Hill Lane, the proposed roadway crosses an open, plowed, partially inundated
field to its terminus at SH130 (Figure 8). The corridor was traversed on foot and visually inspected but
not subsurface tested. The field was found to be devoid of archeological features or artifacts. Due to the
presence of a highly disturbed agricultural field (Figure 12), although inspected on foot, no shovel tests
were placed from east of Hill Lane to the projects terminus at SH130.

Trench Excavation Summary
A total of four backhoe trenches (BHT 1-4) were excavated within the Howard Lane Extension Phase II
project area (Appendix A). Trenches were placed in level one terrace areas (T1) adjacent to Gilleland
Creek where deep alluvial soils could potentially contain preserved archeological deposits.
Backhoe Trench 1 (Figures 12-15) was excavated approximately 15 meters east of Gilleland Creek,
immediately south of the project’s centerline within an area mapped as Tinn Clay. The first stratum
extended to a depth of 60 centimeters below the ground surface (cmbgs) and consisted of thick, blocky
and angular brown (10 YR 4/3) clay loams. At 60 cmbgs the soil color was observed to change to a dark
yellowish brown (10 YR 4/6) that extended to 120 cmbgs. Within this second stratum, fossilized shell
was noted in the east trench wall at approximately 65 cmbgs. At 75 cmbgs, calcium carbonate precipitate
was first noted as sparse flecking which increased in frequency with depth. Stratum 3 was noted as
originating at 120 cmbgs. At 120 cmbgs soil texture was revealed to be a crumbly silty-clay loam that
was a light yellowish brown in color (10 YR 6/4). Within this stratum, two medium-sized mammal long
bone fragments were recovered from approximately 236-248 cmbgs (Figure 16). There were no features,
nor artifacts noted in association with the recovered bone and these were considered to be naturally
deposited within the soil column.

Within Stratum 3, at 176 cmbgs, inclusions of decayed bedrock particles and natural chert gravels were
observed, initially comprising approximately 10 percent of the Stratum 4 matrix. At 236 cmbgs these
inclusions increase to 15-20 percent and the gravels become notably larger in size. Backhoe Trench 1
was terminated at a depth of 255 cmbgs in clearly pre-cultural, sterile clay subsoil.
Backhoe Trench 2 (Appendix A; Figures 17-19) was excavated 40 meters east of BHT 1 along the outer
edge of the lower terrace as it transitions to the gradual upland hillside. Within BHT 2, Stratum 1 was
recorded to a depth of 45 cmbgs and was described as a thick, very dark gray (10 YR 3/1), clay loam.
Worm casts and rootlets were noted in high numbers within Stratum 1. Stratum 2 extended from 45
centimeters to a depth of 76 centimeters below the surface and was revealed to be a very dark grayish
brown (10 YR 3/2) clay loam with high sand content. Worm casts were also noted within this stratum as
were the presence of a few rootlets. Stratum 3 was revealed to be a dark brown (10 YR 3/3) clay loam
with less than 10 percent mottles of brownish yellow (10 YR 6/6) loam. At 125 cmbgs, stratum 4 was
marked by a gradual shift in soil color to a yellowish brown (10 YR 5/4). Within stratum 4, calcium
carbonate was observed at 129 cmbgs and increases with frequency as depth increases. At 155 cmbgs
mottling of a brown (7.5 YR 5/4) clay loam was observed at approximately 30 percent frequency along
with granular and rounded pebbles and cobbles. These too, increase in frequency with depth. Backhoe
Trench 2 was terminated at 163 cmbgs in sterile, ancient clay subsoil.

Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated on a T1 terrace 10 meters west of Gilleland Creek. At this location the
west bank is noticeably lower than the east bank with a gradual slope towards the water line suggesting it
may be the predominantly depositional landform. Stratum 1, a dark grayish brown (10 YR 4/2) clay with
high loam content extended to 80 cmbgs. Within this stratum, rootlets were noted to a depth of 60 cmbgs.
Rabdotus shell fragment inclusions occurred throughout this unit and comprised no more than 2% of the
matrix. Stratum 2 extended from 80 cmbgs to a depth of 156 cmbgs. This unit was revealed to be a thick
dark grayish brown (10 YR 4/2) clay loam. Calcium carbonated precipitate was first observed at 110
cmbgs, increasing in frequency with depth. Stratum 3 extends from 156 cmbgs to a depth of 221 cmbgs.
This stratum was recorded as a thick, dark yellowish brown (10 YR 4/4) clay with 30 percent mottles of a
thick, brown (7.5 YR 5/3) clay loam, high concentrations of calcium carbonate, and oxidized sediment
(10 YR 5/8-yellowish brown). Backhoe trench 3 was terminated at 221 cmbgs in ancient, sterile clay
subsoil.

Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated 40 meters west of BHT 3 within a now fallow agricultural field.
Extending to a depth of 141 cmbgs, Stratum 1 of BHT 3 was revealed to be a very dark gray (10YR 3/1),
thick, clay loam. Within this stratum rabdotus inclusions were noted at less than a two percent
concentration. Additionally, Stratum 1 contained intermittent inclusion of water-worn gravels (less than
two percent). Stratum 2, a thick, dark brown (10 YR 3/3) clay extends from 141 cmbgs to a depth of 210
cmbgs. This unit contained inclusions of calcium carbonate precipitate that increase in concentration with
depth. Stratum 3, a light yellowish brown (10 YR 6/4) clay with a high caliche content, was revealed at a
depth of 210 cmbgs. Backhoe Trench 4 was terminated at a depth of 240 cmbgs in sterile, ancient clay
subsoil obviously old sterile clays.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under ACT Permit # 5585, Hicks & Company archeologists completed a 100% intensive linear
archeological survey of the City of Austin and Travis County’s proposed Phase II extension of Howard
Lane between Cameron Road and State Highway 130 in eastern Austin, Travis County, Texas. The new
roadway facility measures approximately 1.62 miles (2.6 km) in length with a maximum proposed rightof-way of 114 feet (22.5 acres total to be acquired/impacted). The archeological survey was conducted
for compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas but, lacking any federal triggers, is not subject to the
National Historic Preservation Act.
Archeologists traversed the entire project corridor on foot and found the terrain to be generally open,
rolling hillsides with humucky, inundated lowlands between them. At the project’s crossing of Gilleland
Creek, the terrain was largely composed of recently plowed, inundated fields with excellent surface
visibility. Surveyors supplemented their visual inspection with 17 shovel tests and four backhoe
trenches. Soils in the study corridor were found to be primarily dense, wet, upland clays with only a
narrow band of Holocene alluvium along the banks of Gilleland Creek. No archeological artifacts or
features were observed on the ground surface or within any of the subsurface tests along any portion of
the survey corridor. Likewise, no archeological sites were observed, revisited, or recorded.
As a result of the field investigations, the survey’s Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed
construction has a very low potential to impact intact archeological resources eligible for listing as SALs.
The project is recommended to proceed to construction with no further cultural resource coordination
required. In the unlikely event that previously-undiscovered archeological resources are contacted during
the course of construction, all work in the vicinity should cease immediately until such time as
representatives of the THC can be contacted and the materials are assessed for SAL-eligibility by a
qualified archeologist. Since this project resulted in a “no find,” all survey-generated documents, notes,
and photographs will be curated at Hicks & Company’s offices in Austin, Texas. This report is offered in
partial fulfillment of ACT Permit #5585.

Hicks & Company Scope of Work
Howard Lane Extension, Phase II
March 19, 2010
This scope of work describes an intensive linear archeological survey for the City of Austin and
Travis County’s proposed extension of Howard Lane in eastern Travis County, Texas (Figures 1
and 2). The proposed construction will exist of entirely new roadway extending east from
Howard Lane’s current terminus at Cameron Road to State Highway (SH) 130 approximately a
half-mile south of Gregg Manor Road. The roadway will consist of an entirely new four-lane
facility with two 12-foot-wide travel lanes for each direction with 1.5-foot interior curbs and
gutters and 2-foot exterior curbs and gutters. The facility will also include a 20-foot-wide
median, a 5-foot-wide bike lane, and a 6-foot-wide sidewalk on either side of the road. To
complete this project, the City/County requires a right-of-way width of 114 feet. The extension
will cover 1.25 miles of relatively undisturbed land for a total of 17.27 acres of impacts. Exact
depths of impact have not been confirmed, though roadway projects of this nature generally
impact the upper two to three feet of sediment; however, since the alignment will cross Gilleland
Creek, it has been determined that a bridge structure with deeply-installed bridge piers will be
required. Construction will take place on land to be owned and controlled by the City of Austin
or Travis County, depending on location, and is therefore subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). The entire project also requires a City of Austin Environmental Assessment;
however, the project does not involve any federal funding or permitting and therefore does not
require compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended. This project was previously coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
through a letter dated February 17, 2010, with recommendations for intensive archeological
survey and backhoe trenching. Subsequently, the THC concurred with Hicks & Company’s
recommendations on March 11, 2010.
Hicks & Company understands that right-of-entry has been acquired for 100 percent of the
proposed right-of-way.
Background information was gathered using the THC’s Online Sites Atlas (“the Atlas”) in order
to determine if any previously recorded archeological sites exist within one kilometer of the
proposed alignment (referred to as the “project area”). The review determined four archeological
sites were documented within the project area along with nine previously recorded sites just
outside the one-kilometer boundary (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1). Furthermore, the Atlas shows
five previously conducted archeological surveys were completed within or adjacent to the
proposed alignment, while two cemeteries have been recorded within the project area.

The largest areal survey within the project area was conducted by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1989. The survey begins at the westernmost portion
of the project area and encompasses the majority of the alignment. The survey overlaps Site
41TV1419, a historic house site with two associated cisterns recorded in 1988 approximately 600
meters from the proposed alignment. Recorders did not recommend the site as eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
The survey completed by HUD encompasses three more sites within a kilometer and a half of the
alignment, each of which was recorded as a historic house site not eligible for listing in the
NRHP or as an SAL. In 1995, just north of the survey completed by HUD, the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) conducted an
areal survey during which no sites were recorded, as well as a linear survey along Cameron
Road, marking the western boundary of the proposed alignment. Six previously recorded
archeological sites are situated just west of the Cameron Road survey, one of which, Site
41TV88, lays at the very edge of the project area. Referred to as the Pat Parker Site, recorders in
1960 described it as a prehistoric burial site from the Austin Phase. Limited information
regarding site specifics is available, though artifacts were collected and sent to various
laboratories for further study. The site was not listed for any further work, nor is it listed in the
NRHP or as an SAL. The five other sites adjacent to the Cameron Road survey are located
immediately outside the project area and are described as two historic house sites, two
prehistoric open campsites/lithic scatters, and one multi-component historic and prehistoric site.
None of these were recorded as eligible for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL.
Site 41TV1739 was recorded in 1995 and is described as a prehistoric open campsite
approximately 185 meters from the proposed alignment. It was not recommended for listing in
the NRHP or as an SAL, though it was recorded in the same year as an adjacent, unknown
survey that loosely parallels the proposed alignment (likely conducted in preparation for the
Lower Colorado River Authority’s McNeil-Bastrop electrical transmission line). The eastern
boundary of the proposed alignment abuts a survey conducted by TxDOT/FHWA in association
with SH 130 construction in 2001. Approximately 375 meters east of this survey is Site
41TV1893, also recorded in 2001 as a historic midden ineligible for listing in the NRHP or as an
SAL. Finally, Site 41TV1977, a historic house site, was recorded just south of the project area.
It, like the rest of the surveys in and directly adjacent to the project area, was not recommended
as eligible for listing in the NRHP or as an SAL.
The proposed roadway will cross gently- to moderately-sloping rangeland with drainage into
Gilleland Creek near its confluence with Harris Branch. According to the Austin Sheet of the
Geological Atlas of Texas, the area is underlain by Navarro and Taylor Groups undivided (Knt)
of the Upper Cretaceous (also referred to as “upper Taylor marl”). The formation is calcareous,
clayey, light- to medium-gray and brown with a thickness of approximately 600 feet. Intermittent
portions of the alignment are underlain by Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qhg) of the Pleistocene, a
high gravel deposit found on terraces along streams. Soils within the project area consist of
Houston Black clay (HnB) and Heiden clay (HeC2), comprising 37 percent and 34 percent of the
project area, respectively. Houston Black clay is described as a residuum weathered from
calcareous shale of Taylor marl and Eagleford shale and is a relatively deep soil, reaching a
depth of at least 80 inches before terminating at bedrock. Heiden clay is described as a clayey

residuum weathered from clayey shale of Eagleford or Taylor marl. It consists of clay to
approximately 50 inches before transitioning to silty clay to termination at a depth of at least 80
inches below the surface. Austin silty clay (AsC2) occurs along ridges within the project area
(comprising approximately 15 percent of the soils) and is a residuum weathered from chalk.
Shallower than Houston Black and Heiden clays, it generally reaches a depth of 40 inches before
bedrock. Archeological sites in these soil contexts are generally found on the ground surface or
shallowly-buried. The remaining soil within the project area is classified as Tinn clay, a
Holocene age-derived clayey alluvium from mixed sources. Found in the project area only along
the floodplains of Gilleland Creek, Tinn clay reaches a depth of 80 inches. Archeological sites in
this soil may be found either shallowly- or deeply-buried, resulting in an increased potential for
preservation.
The proposed Howard Lane extension will consist of entirely new roadway to pass through
relatively undisturbed land with potential for significant, deeply-buried archeological sites. Half
of the proposed alignment is unsurveyed, while the other half has undergone areal survey not
subject to stricter linear survey standards. Therefore, Hicks & Company will conduct intensive
linear archeological survey supplemented by shovel testing for the previously unsurveyed
portion of the proposed alignment. Shovel tests will be conducted at a rate of no less than sixteen
subsurface tests per linear mile per 100-foot right-of-way, in accordance with the THC’s
minimum standards for intensive linear archeological surveys. Testing frequency may decline in
areas with excellent surface visibility or modern disturbance. For those areas previously
surveyed, it is recommended that limited survey is conducted to verify a lack of archeological
sites. This survey will consist of surface inspection with shovel testing in areas that have
potential for site deposits. All shovel tests will be excavated to a depth of one meter, to bedrock,
or to culturally sterile soils, whichever is encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests will be
screened through ¼” hardware cloth, and cultural materials will be recorded and returned to the
shovel test upon completion. Investigators will record their observations and the results of shovel
tests through notes, standardized shovel test forms, and photographs. A no-collection policy will
be followed, and shovel test locations will be recorded with a Trimble GeoExplorer sub-meter
GPS.
Hicks & Company also recommends backhoe trenching is performed along the portions of the
alignment intersecting Gilleland Creek due to potential for deep Holocene soils. Trenches will be
approximately one meter wide and three to five meters long and will extend to maximum depth
of impact, clearly sterile subsoil, or evidence of subsurface disturbance, whichever is
encountered first. Soils will be screened through ¼” hardware cloth at a rate of one bucket-load
per three to four sweeps, and trench excavations will be monitored at all times for artifacts,
features, and subtle soil variations. All observations will be recorded on standardized trench
excavations forms, and trench locations will be recorded using a Trimble GeoExplorer sub-meter
GPS.
Any archeological sites encountered during survey will be investigated through no less than six
shovel tests in order to define site boundaries relative to the project area. Subsurface tests within
sites will be excavated at a frequency and in an arrangement appropriate for assessing site size,
depth, and significance. Identified sites will be recorded in accordance with the THC’s standards
for site investigation, and site locations will be recorded using a Trimble GeoExplorer sub-meter

GPS. All data will be recorded on standardized forms, and documented sites will be recorded at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory where new trinomials will be assigned.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as required under
Chapter 26 of the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure. The report will make
recommendations regarding the necessity for further investigations with respect to both historic
and prehistoric sites and will be submitted to the THC for review and concurrence. In accordance
with revised ACT requirements, the required number of copies of the final report along with
digital files will be submitted to the THC and other recommended libraries and repositories.
Additionally, if sites are recorded within the study corridor, all project-related forms, notes,
photographs, and documents will be formally curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).
