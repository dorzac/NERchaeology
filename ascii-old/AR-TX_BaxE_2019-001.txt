Abstract
An archaeological survey of the proposed 78 acre (32 hectares) City of Bryan’s Eastside Facility
Project, in Brazos County, Texas was performed by Ed Baxter, Consulting in May of 2019.
Edward P. Baxter was the Principal Investigator and the Project Archaeologist. The survey took
a total of three man days in the field. This study was performed under Texas Antiquities
Committee Permit Number 8903. The project area was investigated using the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing. No previously recorded archaeological sites or cemeteries
were found in the project area. The survey found no new archaeological sites. Copies of this
final short report will be housed at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology
Division, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, and at
Ed Baxter Consulting (College Station, Texas).

Acknowledgments
Ed Baxter Consulting is grateful to Jayson Barfknecht and Bill Riley with the City of
Bryan and Bill Cullen of JBS Engineering & Environmental, LLC who aided in project
development and completion. Special thanks to the landowners Susan Mcgee Vogt and Durwood
Thompson, Jr. who provided access to the project area.

Definition of the Study Area
The 78 acre (32 hectare) project area is located in the Southeast Texas Archaeological
Region (Figure 1) and is depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Reliance,
Texas 7.5’ topographic quadrangle, 3096-413 (Figure 2) at UTM 14R 765459; 3393889 in
Brazos County, Texas.
The area is privately owned and consists of pasture and forest used for ranching and deer
hunting. Ranching disturbances included field roads and pasture clearing activities.
The Texas Municipal Power Agency’s (TMPA) high voltage power line and access road
has been constructed along the northern boundary of the project area.
An intermittent portion of Brushy Creek traverses along the northeastern boundary of the
project area. An intermittent tributary to Brushy Creek traverses along the southeastern portion
of the project area to a point of confluence with Brushy Creek at the eastern corner of the project.

Vegetation specific to the project area (Figure 3) was mapped by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (TPWD). GIS data and vegetation descriptions can be found at
https://tpwd.texas.gov/gis/programs/landscape-ecology/by-ecoregion.
They describe the project area as being in the East Central Texas Plains Southern Post Oak
Savannah with the following specific divisions and areas: Post Oak Savanna: Post Oak Motte and
Woodland, 36 acres (14 hectares); Post Oak Savanna: Savanna Grassland, 11 acres (4
hectares); Central Texas: Floodplain Hardwood Forest, 27 acres, (11 hectares); Central Texas:
Riparian Hardwood Forest, <1 acre ((<1 hectare); Central Texas: Riparian Herbaceous
Vegetation, <1 acre (<1 hectare).
Soils types specific to the project area were documented on the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (WSS)
website http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/app/HomePage.htm and are depicted in Figure 4.
Approximately 63 percent of the project area is a low probability area for intact prehistorical
cultural resource sites. This area contains Eocene and Pleistocene soils that consist of a thin
sandy mantel over clay that has been disturbed by pedoturbation and ranching activities. The
majority of the proposed facilities are within this area. The remaining 37 percent of the project
area consists of loamy alluvium of Holocene age found along the floodplains of intermittent
branches of Brushy Creek. Only a very small portion of this area is included in the facility
plans.

Management Summary
The City of Bryan proposes to develop an approximately 78 acre (32 hectares) area
(Figure 2) above. The proposed Eastside Facility will consist of one electrical sub-station and
other facilities which are still in the planning stage. An archaeological survey of the tract was
conducted by Ed Baxter Consulting at the request of the City of Bryan, Texas, to support
development of the proposed Eastside Facility. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued
Antiquities Permit 8903 for the project. Ed Baxter Consulting is a sole proprietor company with
no employees other than the owner, Ed Baxter, Registered Professional Archaeologist. The area
was surveyed on May fourteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fourth, 2019. A total of 30 person/hours
were expended on the survey.

Research Design
Pre-field research on previously recorded sites and surveys on or near the project area
was conducted using the online resources of the THC’s Atlas, (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us/).
Relevant reports that document work in the area were downloaded from the Atlas and were
utilized in the research. Background research also included a review of historical aerial
photographs found at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center
(https://eros.usgs.gov/#/Find_Data/Products_and_Data_Available/Single_Frame Records) and
historical aerials found on Google Earth Pro https://earth.google.com/web/. Historic USGS and
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) quadrangles found at the Texas Natural
Resources Information System (TNRIS) Texas Historic Overlay located at http://tnristxhistoricoverlay.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.
EROS single frame aerials included ARA001160142176, January 25, 1953, 1:69,000;
AR1VUB000050052, March 14, 1958, 1:17,000; and AR6145009600204, November 18, 1970,
1:62,292. Historic aerial photographs found on Google Earth Pro included 2010 and 2011
versions. TNRIS historic quadrangles included USGS Austin, Texas 1954, 1:250,000; USACE
Carlos, Texas 1919, 1:62,000; USGS Carlos, Texas 1956, 1:62500 and USGS Reliance, Texas
1959, 1:24,000.
The Project Archaeologist investigated the project area utilizing surface inspection and
shovel testing. Shovel tests were dug to the underlying clay subsoil or water and all excavated earth
from the shovel testing was passed through ¼ inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. This task was
documented through a digital shovel test log, digital field notes, digital photography and digital
photographic logs. In addition, a handheld GPS was used to record the location of shovel tests.
Shovel tests were concentrated in and around the areas of potential effect (APE).
Projects digital notes, logs, and photographs will be prepared for curation using TARL
standards and then curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin,
Texas. The survey short report was prepared using the guidelines established by the Council of
Texas Archaeologists and submitted to the THC for review.

Results
Pre-field research on previously recorded sites and surveys on or near the project area
indicated that there were no previous archaeological surveys in the project area. No previously
recorded archaeological sites or cemeteries, National Register Properties or State Archaeological
Landmarks were found within the project area. A review of historic USGS and USACE
quadrangles and historic aerials originally indicated the presence of historic cultural resources in
the form of a possible house and outbuilding within the project area. A refinement of the georeferencing in ArcMap indicated these features may have been outside the project area. No
indications of these resources were found during the survey.
The pedestrian survey and forty three shovel tests found no new cultural resource sites.
One modern deer hunter’s cabin (Figure 5a.) and one deer stand (Figure 5b.) was found. A
review of the historic Google Earth Pro aerial photographs indicated the deer cabin appears in
the area between 2010 and 2011.
Areas within the floodplains of the two intermittent streams were saturated with standing
water in many areas.
Details of the locations and records of the shovel tests can be found in Appendix I of this
report.

Recommendations
The background research found no previously recorded cultural resource sites, National
Register Properties or State Archaeological Landmarks within the confines of the project area.
No new cultural resource sites were found during the course of the archaeological survey.
Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Bryan’s proposed Eastside Facility will have no
impact on significate cultural resources and be allowed to proceed.
