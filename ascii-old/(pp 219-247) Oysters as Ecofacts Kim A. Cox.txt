Oysters as Ecofacts

Kim A. Cox

ABSTRACT
The American Oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is offered as a substitute for
artifacts, which are scarce in most coastal archeological deposits. Various
methods of analysis of archeological oyster deposits are examined as they
relate to human ecology on the macro- and micro-scales, and as they contribute to our understanding of Holocene environments. The focus of this article is
the Archaic of the central Texas coast.

INTRODUCTION
Although archeological deposits from the Archaic are quite common along
the Texas Gulf Coast, most are comprised of estuarine shell matrices that have
produced few, if any, artifacts. Often as extensive and as difficult to excavate
as burned rock middens, these shell deposits, with the exception of a handful
of cultural resource management projects, have not drawn the wide attention
of their Central Texas counterparts, principally because the dearth of artifacts
has long been equated with a lack of discernible information.
Then, beginning in the late 1980s, innovations in shellfish analysis (e.g.,
Custer and Doms 1990; Kent 1988; Lawrence 1988, 1989) led to the emergence of the long ignored American Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as a major
archeological resource. Through these inventive approaches and techniques,
the oyster became not only a worthy substitute for artifacts, in many cases it
was to become vastly superior in the quantitative and qualitative production
of archeological information. This new recognition of the importance of the
oyster was, in many respects, to revolutionize coastal archeology.
Although still in their formative stages, the analyses and approaches discussed here are ones in which the oyster has already yielded meaningful information. The techniques and the significance of the inquiries are examined
as they relate to human ecology on the macro- and micro-scales, and as they
provide information for deciphering Holocene environments. The analyses rely
heavily on intersite comparisons; the data from as many as 34 dated shell strata
have been used in their formation.

HUMAN ADAPTATIONS AND COASTAL ECOLOGY

The coastal Archaic of the central Texas coast was originally defined by T.
N. Campbell (1947). He characterized it as a pre-ceramic, hunting/gathering
expression (called the Aransas Focus) with a homogeneous lifestyle, identified
by crude stone dart points and a suite of shell tools, that supposedly persisted
from some unspecified date until the advent of the Late Prehistoric period. Until
recently, this was the extent of knowledge, more or less, of coastal Archaic
adaptations (e.g., Prewitt et al. 1987; Shafer and Bond 1985; Steele and Mokry
1985). The demise of the Aransas Focus as a viable concept came when the
radiocarbon dating of numerous well-stratified shell deposits led to the realignment of the coastal Archaic in terms of human ecology (see discussion in Ricklis
1990, 1993; Ricklis and Cox 1991).

RADIOCARBON DATES AND THE CHRONOLOGY
OF HUMAN COASTAL ADAPTATION
Generally, archeological shell strata produce little datable material other
than shells. However, the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells,
and the viability of certain correction factors and the irrelevance of others, have
recently been demonstrated through the use of paired shell/charcoal dates (Ricklis
and Cox 1991; Ricklis 1993).
When properly adjusted and plotted chronologically, radiocarbon dates from
sites on the central Texas coast with intensive use of estuarine resources show an
unmistakable temporal clustering (Figure 1 and Table 1). Ricklis (1993) has
theorized that this periodicity, supported by the presence or absence of certain
time-diagnostic projectile point types in surface collections, indicates intensive
human exploitation of estuarine resources only in times of sea level stability (see
also Bloom 1983; Custer 1988; Reitz 1988; Widmer 1988).
Furthermore, the patterning of human coastal occupation, as Ricklis (1993)
and Bernstein (1993) argue, has significant implications for the relative value of
the estuary as an exploitable biomass, as well as for the microscopic
phytoplanktons at the bottom end of its food chains. If people did not intensively
use the estuaries during periods of rapid Holocene sea level rise, the food
resources were most likely not as available to them during such times (Custer
1988). Assuming this to be true, one must look for ways in which a rapidly rising
sea can adversely affect an estuarine biome (cf. Widmer 1988). Both Ricklis
(1993) for the Texas Coast, and Bernstein (1993) for the southern New England
coast, have suggested that this was the result of rising sea levels changing highly
productive estuarine ecosystems into much less productive marine ecosystems

Much of the supporting documentation for these data is presented at length in Ricktis
(1993).

At the end of the last Ice Age, rapid sea level rise sent marine waters far up
the deeply downcut Pleistocene river valleys, creating fjord-like estuaries quite
different in appearance from the bay/lagoon estuaries of today. Initial evidence
of estuarine adaptation in Texas comes from the end of the first major sea level
stillstand, which occured between approximately 9000-7000 B.P. (see Figure 1).
This was followed by major stillstands at ca. 5900-4200 B.P., and from ca. 3000
B.P. to present (see Brown et al. 1976; Frazier 1974; Prewitt and Paine 1988). As

the continuing sedimentation process began to catch up with sea level during
stillstand (see Dalrymple et al. 1992), highly photosynthetic shallows aided in
turning the estuaries into rich areas of primary organic production, where the
phytoplanktons and the salt grasses flourished.
The creation of highly productive estuarine biomes during periods of
stillstand was probably facilitated in the Middle Holocene, and certainly in the
Late Holocene, by the formation of barrier shoals and islands (see Ricklis 1993).
These had the effect of trapping river-borne nutrients and sediments and reducing turbidity and salinity, turning the estuaries into some of the worldâs most
highly productive ecosystems (Odum 1971; Whittaker 1975). By comparison,
equal areas of the worldâs oceans are as much as 1000 times less productive
(Valiela 1984).
With the advent of rapid sea level rise after the first two major stillstands,
sea level increases of an estimated 100 cm/century (see Paine 1991:170) pulled
away from much lower sedimentation rates (between 6-22 cm/century to approximately 38 cm/century [Shepard and Moore 1960; Widmer 1988]), inundating the estuariesâ shallows and marshes, diluting their nutrients and increasing
marine influences. The wide salinity gradient upon which highly productive
estuaries depended (Bulger et al. 1993) was most likely compressed into the

224

lower river systems, where fshing and shellfishing may have continued (see
Weinstein 1994). Primary production, which thrived in the shallow, less turbid,
and more brackish estuarine waters during stillstand, would likely have been
greatly affected by the shift to heavy marine influence.
Because all subsequent levels on the estuarine food chain, including oysters,
are either directly or indirectly dependent on primary production, periods of
rising sea level probably had the effect of greatly reducing the density of oysters,
and of turning what was perhaps never more than a marginal human food
resource into one whose reduced abundance no longer justified its exploitation
(see Perlman 1980). Thus, through a series of deductions supported by modern
analogs, the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells not only led to the complete
realignment of the coastal Archaic in terms of human ecology, it also focused
attention on the effects of environmental change on the exploitable estuarine
biomass (Ricklis 1993).

SEASONALITY
It has long been known that most bivalves exhibit annual growth patterns
on the exteriors of their shells (Lutz and Rhoads 1980). Over a decade ago,
Lawrence Aten (1981) pioneered a method for the determination of seasonality through the examination of these annuli on Rangia from archeological shell
middens on the upper Texas coast. Theoretically, the same could have been
done for oysters, which are at least as prevalent as Rangia in coastal archeological sites, but they seem to have frustrated all attempts of accurately deciphering their outer shell growth rings (see Claassen 1986; Palmer and Carriker
1979).
Oysters, however, unlike other bivalves, also show growth annuli on the
ligostracum of their umbos or hinges (Figure 2). As pointed out by Kent (1988),
these annuli are far easier to read and are more reliable than those on the oysterâs
exterior surfaces. Previous attempts had been made to use these annuli to determine age and season of death (e.g., Sambol and Finks 1977; Waselkov 1982,
1987). But it was not until Kent (1988) and Lawrence (1988) published their
results that the efficacy of the technique of examining oyster umbos for seasonality was firmly established.
This method was based on comparisons of monthly growth rates of umbo
annuli on live oysters through their yearly cycle. Relying on these modern
growth rates, Kent (1988), Lawrence (1988), and Custer and Doms (1990) have
determined season of death on archeological samples by measuring the distance
of growth past the last winter growth break, and comparing it to previous annuli
on the same valve.
Kentâs and Lawrenceâs pioneering method relies, however, on the ability
of the oyster analyst to read winter growth breaks, and, to a lesser extent, on
their knowledge of the growth rates of the archeological samples being analyzed
(Claassen 1991). This has led to criticism by archeologists such as Russo

Cox -- Oysters as Ecofacts

225

Figure 2. Winter/early spring growth annuli on lower umbos of Crassostrea virginica.

(1991a, 199 l b), who found that oysters from "southern" waters do not produce
distinctive winter growth breaks (a fact acknowledged by Kent [1988]).
While this may be true of the Florida oysters examined by Russo and Kent,
it has not proven to be the case for oysters from the Texas coast today (Cox and
Cox 1993; Ricklis 1990). Galtsoff (1964) has reported that the fastest growth rate
of Crassostrea virginica is in water temperatures between 15-20Â° C, with growth
virtually ceasing in the lower direction at 10Â° C and significantly declining in the
upward direction at 25Â° C (cf. Austin et al. 1993; Haven and Morales-Alamo
t966). Hildebrand and King (1979), and recent unpublished data from the Texas
Parks & Wildlife Department (Cox and Cox 1993:Figure 2), show that water
temperatures in the Coastal Bend of Texas usually average between 10-15Â° C for
the months of December and January, with actual temperatures sometimes falling below 10Â° C during those months. By contrast, information presented by
Chestnut (1974) shows that winter water temperatures on the west coast of
Florida average about 8Â° C warmer than those of the central Texas coast. This
seems to explain the lack of distinctive winter growth breaks observed by Russo
and Kent on Florida oysters, and why distinctive winter growth breaks do appear
on Texas oysters.
The method suggested by Kent (1988) was recently applied to numerous
oyster deposits from the Whiteâs Point archeological area on the north side of
Nueces Bay (Cox and Cox 1993). A random sampling of 100 lower valves from
modem oyster beds and reefs from upper and lower Nueces Bay indicated that

226

oysters tend to die naturally in the summer (Figure 3). This is consistent with the
findings of Gunter (1955) on mortality rates of Crassostrea virginica from the
Texas Gulf Coast.

The aggregate graph of the oysters from Whiteâs Point (Figure 4), as well as
those from the individual strata (see Cox and Cox 1993), however, exhibited a
tendency toward a winter/early spring season of death. This is the time of year
when their carbohydrate and glycogen contents were at their highest (Hopkins et
al. 1954; Soniat and Ray 1985).
Ricklis (1988, 1990) had argued that the Late Prehistoric populations of
the central Texas coast occupied the coast on a seasonal basis. The seasonality
data from Whiteâs Point indicated that this pattern was at least 7500 years old
(Ricklis 1993).

DENSITY AND CONTENT OF SHELL STRATA
At Whiteâs Point, all shell deposits were thin with tow artifact densities.
With the possible exception of Kent-Crane (41AS3) on Copano Bay, this is true
for all Archaic shell deposits in the Coastal Bend area of Texas prior to approximately 1800 B.P. These shell deposits appear to be the results of single procurement episodes by small groups of people (cf. Lavin 1988; Stein 1992). The
appearance of more extensive deposits after that time corresponds to a major
shift in settlement and biotic procurement patterns beginning in the very Late
Archaic and extending into the Late Prehistoric period (Ricklis 1990, 1993).
These later shell deposits have higher artifact densities, evidencing much greater
ranges of activity, and produce much more abundant fish remains (Ricklis t990,
1993; Weinstein 1992, 1994).
Through the examination of the density and content of shell deposits, we
can determine the relative value of the estuary to prehistoric populations
(Waselkov 1987). By all indications, Late Prehistoric sites like 41SP120 on
Corpus Christi Bay (Ricklis 1990, 1993) and 41CL2 on San Antonio Bay
(Weinstein 1992) supported much larger populations than did their Early and
Middle Holocene counterparts.
By converting the size of shellfish and fish otoliths to calories, a general
idea can be obtained of calories being extracted from the estuarine biomass by
time period (see Bernstein 1993). Unfortunately, an absolute comparison between time periods of tota! calories consumed at a site (and from there to
population estimates) is difficult to determine because, among other things, bone
from Early and Middle Holocene deposits does not often survive (see Ricklis
1988). Nevertheless, the relative value of estuarine resources is a subject that will
continue to draw considerable attention, principally because of its implications
for the Late Archaic aggregation of coastal populations (see Ricklis 1990), and
the possible development of complex social organization in societies that never
adopted agriculture (cf. Arnold 1992; Marquardt 1985; Russo 1988).
Waselkov (1987) and Henshilwood et al. (1994) have also suggested that
the absence of artifacts in some shell middens is important. They argue that if
women and children were principally responsible for the middens, one would not

228

Texas Archeological Society

expect to see certain types of artifacts. This would also mean that these types of
shell heaps are strictly related to a specific food procurement activity, with main
residential sites usually located some distance away.

HUMAN PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES
Lower vs. Upper Shell Ratios
In trying to establish an absolute number of calories by strata, one factor
that comes into play is determining the total number of oysters consumed. While
the obvious approach of taking the total number of valves and dividing by two is
logical, it is also probably inaccurate.
Oysters, like many bivalves, contain distinct upper (or right) and lower (or
left) valves. The upper valve is usually flat with a concave umbo. The lower
valve is more cupped and has a convex umbo (technically the "chondrophore").
When the oyster umbos from Whiteâs Point were separated in the field, the
results showed a consistent weighting toward the lower valve (Table 2). This is a
curious phenomenon that seems to be a regular feature in other archeological
areas on the Texas coast (e.g., Weinstein 1994). Since even fragmented upper
and lower umbos are easily identifiable, and since a meticulous attempt was
made at Whiteâs Point to identify all umbos in the field (see discussion in Ricklis
1993), it is doubtful that the noted difference was a result of differential preservation between upper and lower umbos. Indeed, some deposits that contained very
few fragmented shells, such as the upper level at 41SP177, produced some of the
most striking disparities.
Therefore, as suggested by Bernstein (1993:65), in determining the minimum number of individuals, the number of lower umbos would have to be used.
If, however, all oysters were being shucked at the site of procurement and were
being brought "on the half shell," the actual number of individuals in the archeological deposits would be represented by the total number of valves and not
merely lower ones. It should be pointed out that attempts were made at Whiteâs
Point to pair larger valves but that they were never successful. Theoretically, if
oysters were being shucked where the shells were being deposited, it should be
fairly easy to match large, unique, upper and lower valves (see Koike 1979). To
date, no one has demonstrated that this can be done for archeological oyster
deposits. The tendency toward a prevalence of lower valves may also have its
uses in determining whether certain shell strata are the results of human food
procurement or the results of natural processes.

Evidence of Opening Techniques
Kent (1988) and Waselkov (1987) have reported archeological evidence of
opening oysters appearing as fire scorching and shucking. This latter technique,

which involves opening the oysters without cooking the meat, includes fracturing, insertion of sharp objects to separate the valves, and hammering (stunning
the valves open).
While scorching is rare on the Whiteâs Point oysters (with the exception of a
hearth area at 41SP153), possibly intentional shell damage on many valves was
documented during laboratory analyses. In some instances, this damage was
apparently caused by the insertion of a strong, sharp object between the valves on
the anterior side of the oyster slightly below the umbo, producing identifiable
shell damage (Figure 5). Frequently, the distal end of the shell was also chipped,
perhaps to break the airlock (Waselkov 1987), or perhaps to insert a long, thin
object to slice the adductor muscle (Kent 1988).
In field experiments, hammering above the adductor muscle with a heavy
object would sometimes cause the oyster to open enough to insert a sharp instrument to slice the adductor muscle; this was most easily done at its attachment on the upper valve. This technique left no noticeable damage on either
valve.
While there was apparent evidence of shucking from many sites at Whiteâs
Point, it was never universal, and greatly varied in percentages in deposits where
it did occur. Several deposits produced few if any valves that evidenced shucking
damage. None of the valves from a hearth area at 41SP153, for instance, showed
shucking damage to their shells. These were the only valves that had been
scorched in a fire, and were also the only valves in which there were equal
numbers of upper and lower valves, implying a different opening technique.

In their analysis of Late Holocene mussel shell "megamiddens" in South
Africa, Henshilwood et al. (1994:104) suggested that "shells discarded as part of
a processing strategy should be distinguishable from those discarded after in situ
meat consumption according to the signature they leave in the archaeological
record." Through experimentation, they concluded that the most efficient method
of processing large quantities of mussels was to smoke or sun bake them in the
half shell (cf. Kent 1988:55). The result is a light weight, highly nutritious food
bulk that could be consumed without subsequent risk of food poisoning. Thus,
they argued that the large Late Holocene middens were actually "localities where
mussels were dried by work groups of hunter-gatherers prior to being transported
and consumed inland" (Henshilwood et al. 1994:104).
No similar experiments have been undertaken with oysters, but such an
activity could explain the prevalence of lower valves. As Waselkov (1987:103)
pointed out, "since hand shucking is more time-consuming than roasting, there
must be some incentive to avoid cooking the mollusc." The incentive could be
for long-term meat preservation in the fashion described above. Since oysters can
be easily smoked or dried for preservation, the possibility of mass extraction for
future consumption has to be considered.

Height]Width Ratios
Based on studies of oysters procured from different environments, Kent
(1988) proposed a method for analyzing their height/width ratios (H/W): the

Cox -- Oysters as Ecofacts

231

maximum dorsal-ventral measurement over the maximum anterior-posterior measurement (for purposes of clarity, the term "width" is used instead of the more
scientifically accurate term "length"). These environments were identified as:
H/W Ratio less than 1.3: beaches and bars of coarse, firmly packed
sand.

H/W Ratio between 1.3 and 2.0: mixed mud with sand, oysters occur
either singly or in loose clusters.
H/W Ratio greater than 2.0: soft mud bottoms, generally in deeper
channels, that produce large oysters, or oyster reefs that produce small,
elongated oysters.
In an examination of oysters from coastal Georgia, Crook (1992) found four
basic types of intertidal oyster communities: (1) singles (including small clumps
of not more than six oysters from soft mud along small tidal creeks), (2) clusters (usually 10-30 attached oysters from firm bottoms along larger tidal streams,
or from softer muddy bottoms within tidal flats), (3) bank communities (usually
more than 30 attached individuals found in large tidal streams on either firm or
dead oyster substrates), and (4) reef communities (very dense and closely spaced
clumps of 30 or more oysters living on a dead oyster substrate). In the sampled
communities, Crook (1992) obtained measurements of average height, width,
H/W ratios, and size index (the square root of H x W):

All of the oysters from Whiteâs Point from Early and Middle Holocene
deposits fell in the fairly narrow H/W range of 1.63 to 1.76 (Table 3), at the
upper end of Kentâs scale for bed oysters and in line with Crookâs communities
of singles, clusters, and bank oysters. Average heights and widths approximate
Crookâs (1992) communities of clusters and banks. However, modem oysters
from reefs and large bank communities in upper Nueces Bay, as well as commercially harvested oysters from Aransas and Matagorda bays, average 1.7, indicating that the Early and Middle Holocene oysters from Whiteâs Point were from
communities similar to those existing today. The obvious differences with Kentâs
and Crookâs reef oysters are most likely due to slight differences in method of
height measurement (see Kent 1988:29; Cox and Cox [1993] simply took the
longest dorsal-ventral measurement), and also perhaps due to different sampling

232

techniques (most modem samples from Nueces Bay were legal size, 7.5 cm, or
larger), and the different reef environments of the Texas coast vs. those of
Maryland and Georgia. Overharvesting of reef oysters apparently was of no
significance, since the reefs from upper Nueces Bay, where commercial harvesting has been off-limits for years, had similar H/W ratios to the heavily harvested
reefs of Aransas and Matagorda bays.

Since by far the densest biomass of oysters exists in large bank and reef
communities (Chestnut 1974; Hedgpeth 1957), if we view human adaptation as a
response to an exploitable biomass, then the focus of attention should be on the
large, easily exploitable, oyster communities as food resources. Almost certainly,
oysters have lived in Nueces Bay from its initial inundation (Gunter 1979).
However, its dense communities of oysters would not have flourished in times of
high salinities (Britton and Morton 1989; Claassen 1985), active wave action, or
strong currents (Galtsoff 1964; MacKenzie 1981), all of which conditions most
likely prevailed in times of marine influence during rapid sea level rise. Productive communities today are largest and most prevalent in the less turbid waters
behind the barrier islands away from marine influenced areas (Britton and Morton
1989; Chestnut 1974).
The consistency in the H/W ratios from Whiteâs Point not only shows that
oysters were gathered from similar environments over long periods of time, it
also demonstrates the marginality of the oyster as a food resource. With the

Cox ~ Oysters as Ecofacts

233

destruction of the dense oyster communities from rising sea level, the return for
the human energy expended apparently did not justify the effort in exploiting
other oyster habitats. During times of heavy marine influence, because of reduced densities, the oyster had declined in value relative to alternative terrestrial
resources to the extent that human food procurement patterns were radically
changed.
Ultimately, then, the virtual abandonment of the estuaries as a food resource area during times of rapid sea level rise was an indirect result of climatic changes. An understanding of these climatic changes and their effects
would greatly facilitate an understanding of the intricate interplay between the
relative values of terrestrial and estuarine resources. Several authors have
recently dealt with the subject of human settlement patterns being a result of
environmental conditions affecting terrestrial resources (e.g., Leonard and Reed
1993). However, the effect of a changing climate on estuarine resources is still
not well understood. It is in this regard that the study of archeological oyster
deposits will probably make its greatest contribution.

SALINITY DATA
Crassostrea virginica often appear in coastal environments encrusted with
a myriad of organisms. As Crassostrea virginica is euryhaline, most of its encrusting organisms live in much narrower salinity ranges. Kent (1988) proposed a method for determining salinity of oyster environments based on
evidence of the encrusting sponge of the phylum Porifera and genus Cliona.
The different species of this sponge inhabit different salinity ranges in the
estuaries and produce their own distinctive size of boreholes.
Based on studies by Hopkins (1956), Kent (1988) devised a system for
determining salinity that relied on the relative percentages of small boreholes
(incurrent 0.2-0.5 mm, excurrent 0.6-1.6 mm) and large boreholes (incurrent
0.8-2.5, excurrent 2.0-4.5 mm) on oyster valves. The system, as slightly
modified by Cox and Cox (1993) and adapted to the central Texas coast, is as
follows:

5: salinity averaging 25 to 35 ppt, little

Oyster valves only with large

Cox and Cox (1993) identified the salinity ranges for the shell-boring
polychaete Polydora websteri from data on file with the Texas Parks & Wildlife
Department, Rockport, Texas (see Wargo and Ford [1993] for a detailed discussion of other environmental requirements of Polydora sp., and their effects on
the condition of oysters). Salinity ranges of estuarine shellfish species are from
Castagna and Chanley (1973) and Castagna (1992 personal communication).
This system of salinity regimes was applied to all oyster deposits at Whiteâs
Point. The oyster shell strata (s. s.) dated, the median of the corrected and
calibrated 1-sigma range, and the salinity regime are presented in the following

These data are presented chronologically in Figure 7. The date for 41SP177
(70-80 cm) is an average of the actual radiocarbon dates that bracket it.
When compared to recently revised effective moisture ranges for Central
Texas (Toomey et al. 1993), Figure 7 presents interesting parallels in two respects. First, the post-glacial minimum in effective moisture in Central Texas
from ca. 5000-2500 B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993) roughly corresponds chronologically to higher salinity readings in Nueces Bay. And second, the return to more
mesic conditions from ca. 2500-1000 B.P. (Aikens 1983; Toomey et al. 1993),
with a peak between 1350-1250 B.P. (cf. Aikens 1983), approximately matches
the significant decrease in salinity in Nueces Bay beginning around 3000 B.P.
and extending until about 1300 B.P.

When xeric conditions once again prevailed at ca. 1000 B.P., Whiteâs Point
quite possibly was no longer generally suitable for human occupation and had
been abandoned. Perhaps this is because fishing had taken the place of shellfish
gathering as the primary focus of estuarine exploitation (Ricklis 1993), and
possibly also because the small streams that helped support human occupation
there had quit flowing (cf. Hall 1990).

READABILITY
As discussed above, both Kent (1988) and Russo (1991a, 1991b) found
difficulty in determining seasonality on oysters from southern waters due to a
lack of distinctive winter growth breaks. However, when examining modem
samples from the Texas Gulf Coast, Cox and Cox (1993) did not encounter
similar problems. If Kentâs and Russoâs difficulties were in fact related to the
difference in water temperatures between their comparative samples from the
west coast of Florida and those from the more temperate waters of the Texas Gulf
Coast, then temporal variations in water temperatures should be looked for in
archeological samples.
As mentioned above, the applicability of Kentâs (1988) seasonality technique depends on similar habitats, mostly in terms of winter water temperatures,
between the archeological sample and the modem comparative sample. This,
however, may not have always been the case, as Pielou (1991) points out that the
range for Crassostrea virginica during certain parts of the Archaic period ex-

Cox -- Oysters as Ecofacts

237

tended much farther north than it does today, indicating warmer estuarine waters
during those times along the eastern United States coast. The lowering of the
northern range for oyster began with the cooling of water temperatures in the
Late Holocene, approximately 2500 years ago (Braun 1974; Yesner 1983).
Evidence of possible paleoclimatic shifts in water temperature was looked
for in the various oyster samples from Whiteâs Point. Through examining modem oyster samples, it was discovered that the production of distinctive winter
growth rings was to some extent related to winter water temperatures, with
colder water producing more distinctive lines (Cox and Cox 1993). Presumably,
the annuli of prehistoric oysters living in warmer waters would not be as distinct.
If this is the case, it should be evidenced in the ability of the oyster analyst to
read the umbos for seasonality.

Readability of the oyster deposits from Whiteâs Point is presented in Figure
8. If differences in water temperature are responsible for the variations in the
readability of these oysters, the data from Whiteâs Point would seem to indicate
warmer winters in the Middle Holocene with cooler winters once again prevailing after 3000 B.P.

CHANGE IN AVERAGE HEIGHT
Oysters today along the Texas Gulf Coast reach their market size of 7.5 cm
in approximately 1.5 years (J. D. Gray, Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife,

238

Texas Archeological Society

persona! communication, 1991; see also Hofstetter 1984). After that age, most
oysters are infected by the extremely lethal protistan Perkinsus marinus, which
flourishes in the warm coastal waters of the eastern United States (Fisher et al.
1992; Mackin et al. 1950).
Table 3 presents the average heights and widths of oyster deposits from
Whiteâs Point. The appearance of high percentages of relatively long oysters
from the upper levels of 41SP136 and 41SP153, some of which appeared to be in
excess of 10 years of age, raises the issue of how these oysters managed to avoid
the ravages of Perkinsus and similar diseases that have no effect on humans but
are very deadly to oysters (see Galtsoff 1955).
A possible explanation of this phenomenon could be that oysters in this
time period not only faced lower salinities but also perhaps lived in cooler
winter habitats, both of which combined would be effective deterrents to
Perkinsus and other diseases (Craig et al. 1989; Fisher et al. 1992; Ragone
and Burreson 1993; Soniat 1985). Independent salinity analyses show that these
oysters actually lived in more brackish environments (see Figure 7). The
possibility of lower winter temperatures is also supported by the readability
data discussed above.
A second possibility in accounting for changes in average height is overharvesting (Anderson 1981). This should be indicated by a progressive change in
shellfish size in a rapidly deposited shellfish strata (cf. Botkin 1980). No changes
were noted in the height of oysters from Whiteâs Point, but thinness of strata was
always a limiting factor. It is at least possible that stress from overharvesting
could be identified in denser strata.
In terms of human energy expenditure, a change in height will equate to an
increase or decrease in the returns for the investment of a given amount of labor
(Bernstein 1993). This in turn has obvious implications for the relative value of
oysters to other food resources, as well as for the relative value of the estuary to
terrestrial resources.

CHANGE IN HEIGHT]WIDTH RATIOS
As can be seen from Table 3, height/width ratios of the samples from
Whiteâs Point remained constant for approximately 4000 years and then increased slightly beginning around 3000 B.P. If these oysters all came from
similar habitats -- the bed and reef communities of the Whiteâs Point cove
area on Nueces Bay -- the increase in height/width ratios suggests a changing environment. According to Gunter (1938) and Kent (1988), an increase in
height/width ratios would reflect denser oyster reef populations forcing more
elongated growth.
If true, then an increase would generally indicate a corresponding increase
in the exploitable biomass. At Whiteâs Point, human populations after 3000 B.P.
most likely encountered an increasingly abundant shellfish biomass, which may

Cox ~ Oysters as Ecofacts

239

have helped precipitate a population increase. In any event, the return of humans
to the coast was probably not coincidental. An understanding of the
environmental correlates to the change in height/width ratios ca. 3000 B.P.
would provide information on an intriguing time period in the prehistory of
North America.

A MODEL OF HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS
AND ESTUARINE ECOLOGY
For the time period from 5500-1300 B.P., the consistency of the oyster data
from Whiteâs Point with the known environmental data supports a predictable
model of estuarine ecology and human adaptation. Initially, with the onset of
more xeric, and probably warmer, conditions in the Middle Holocene (see Pielou
1991; Toomey et al. 1993), salinity rose in the estuary, most likely due to
reduced flow of fresh water. As barrier islands formed and the Nueces River
delta prograded, salinity levels began to fall. Higher winter temperatures are
reflected in reduced seasonality determinations on oysters toward the end of the
Middle Holocene stillstand. Oyster communities flourished during this stillstand
in the shallow, nutrient rich, brackish waters of Nueces Bay.
Human populations occupied the coast on a seasonal basis during periods of stillstand, most likely because oysters were a dependable food resource
that could be gathered during winter months when other food resources were
scarce. There are indications from the observed shucking techniques that the
coastal populations may also have been preserving this food resource for later
consumption.
With the onset of rapid sea level rise after ca. 4200 B.P., the highly productive estuarine biomass became subject to harmful marine influences. Oyster data
during the time period of approximately 4000-3000 B.P. reflect a marked increase in salinity. The inundation of the barrier islands released trapped nutrients
and increased average depth and turbidity of the estuary. While there may still
have been continued human exploitation of the estuarine biomass, it was not with
the intensity with which it occurred during stillstand.
As the climate turned more mesic and sea level reached its modern level
around 3000 B.P., the river delta once again prograded, barrier islands formed,
and salinities in the upper Nueces Bay area were progressively reduced. The
increase in lengths and height/width ratios of oysters suggests more favorable
environmental conditions. With lower salinities, much wider salinity gradients,
cooler winters, and increased primary production, oysters lived longer, the exploitable biomass was much denser, and human procurement greatly intensified.
As salinity levels continued to fall during the Late Holocene, Rangia increasingly replaced oysters as the exploitable shellfish. Then, sometime toward
the end of the Late Archaic, shellfish procurement sites along Nueces Bay were
abandoned in favor of sites along the lower estuaries and tidal passes, perhaps, as

240

Texas Archeological Society

suggested by Ricklis (1992, 1993), in response to the increased availability of
fish in those areas.
The methods discussed here offer interdisciplinary insights into estuarine
ecology throughout a large portion of the Holocene. The primary model of
human coastal adaptations was principally formulated from inferences derived
from the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells. Other oyster analyses offer
support for the ecological and geological constructs of the model. They are not
offered as an exhaustive list, but rather as an insight into the enormous potential
of estuarine ecofacts to the field of archeology. Much of the recent scholarship
on shellfish utilization has focused on oysters, where researchers have only now
managed to scratch the surface; there are many other types of estuarine species
found in archeological middens about which very little in the archeological field
has been written.
