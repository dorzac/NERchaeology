SOME TEXAS BLADE TECHNOLOGY
LELAND W. PATTERSON

Abstract
Some previously unreported technology of prismatic blades and prepared cores found on the Upper Texas Gulf Coast and adjacent regions is
discussed, including a detailed review of microblade and other blade
technology represented in collections from Harris County, Texas. Comments are also made on possible external relationships indicated by
similarities in blade core types and related artifacts.
The presence of a complete prismatic blade industry is demonstrated
for several Harris County sites. Use of unifacial arrow points, including
the Mesolithic compound type, before conventional biracial arrow points
is proposed, based on the typology of microliths from these sites, and
related chronology of associated artifacts.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of blade technology with prismatic blades and
prepared cores has long been recognized for the Upper Paleolithic
and Mesolithic periods of Europe and Asia. There are a number of
recent summaries such as Bordes (1968), Bordaz (1970), and Coles
and Higgs (1969). Blade technology studies as related to questions on
peopling of the New World has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly in the Arctic and Pacific Northwest. The general
reader is referred to a report by MacNeish (1964) and the symposium
published inArctic Anthropology, Vo!. 7, No. 2, 1970, for background
on this literature.
There is no complete summary available on North American midcontinent blade technology, as discoveries have not been made uniformly in all regions. Aside from scattered finds in Paleo-Indian
contexts, the Poverty Point and Hopewell assemblages are the main
ones mentioned in the literature concerned with areas north of Mexico and southeast of the Pacific Northwest.
This paper is primarily concerned with small prismatic blades
found in Archaic contexts. It appears to the writer that small blade
technology of the New World late Archaic may be more closely
related to the Old World Mesolithic, with smaller blades and a variety
of prepared core techniques.
Developments in blade technology discoveries are not easy to research. There appears to be a consistent lag in publication and reports
in a wide variety of journals. The writer has the impression, however,

that new blade sites are being found continuously, and may eventually lead to a recognition of a wide distribution over North America.
Aside from demonstrating cultural traits of given groups, specific
blade technologies offer the possibility of providing evidence of external relationships between broad areas and being of value in providing more information on the peopling of the New World at various
times. In addition to presenting some current information this paper
is intended as a plea for more field workers to be alert for these types of
artifacts, as they are often overlooked, or at least not reported in detail.

TEXAS SITES
While blades and polyhedral cores have been known for some time
on the Central Texas Gulf Coast, most of the information has remained
unpublished. Texas blade sites found to date by this survey are summarized in Table I.
In recent years some information on the occurrence of blade technology has been published. Green (1971, 1972) has described blades
and cores from San Saba County. Hester (1971a, 1971b) has published
some information on blades from south Texas.
Alton Briggs (personal communication) has furnished information
that three blades were recovered from a site in Calhoun County, 41 CL
20, on Matagorda Bay.
Several sites in Coke County have been reported to contain blades,
in the Robert Lee Reservoir report by Shafer (1969).
The writer has found a few blade-like objects and a good sample of a
tabular blade core (see Figure l-D) on the surface of site 41 RE 7 in Real
County. The writer has also found a few blades on the surface of Site
41 JW 4 in Jim Wells County.
Evidence for significant new blade technology has been found in
Harris County. There are 19 sites to date with crude prismatic blades,
several with large enough samples for statistical analysis. All of the
sites in Harris County represent surface collections made by the writer
except for the Fullen Site (41 HR 82), with information on this site
coming from Michael OâBrien, as late information after his paper
(1971) was published.
Since most of the sites in Harris County represent material found on
the surface, precise chronology is lacking. It appears however, that
blades were in use from the Archaic to more recent times. Prismatic
blades have been found in context with a large number of dart point
and arrow point types, suggesting a probable time range of 2000 B.C.
to A.D. 1500. Dart points found on sites which have yielded blades
include: Almagre, Gary, Carrollton, Refugio, Ellis, etc. Arrow points
include Perdiz, Bassett and Fresno types. Both pre-ceramic and
ceramic phases are probably represented; most of the sites have some
pottery. Lawrence Aten (personal communication) dates Galveston
Bay shell middens as early as 2000 B.C. and there is stamped pottery
on some of the blade sites which Aten dates as 200 A.D.
The persistence of blades over long periods of time, equal to or
longer than the time estimate for Harris County occurrences, has been
noted at a number of sites, such as the Tehuacan Valley (MacNeish
1969), Magic Mountain (Irwin-Williams and Irwin 1966), and Sierra
de Tamaulipas (MacNeish, 1958).

Site 41 HR 188, which does not have ceramics has a distribution of
blade sizes similar to sites exhibiting ceramic components.
Charles K. Chandler (personal communication) has reported several sites in San Patricio County with blades and cores. Site 41 SP 68
yielded a true polyhedral conical blade core and Site 41 SP 76 a
partially completed conical core. Site 41 SP 77 yielded a block-like
core with two striking platforms at right anglesâon separate faces. The
collection from Site 41 SP 81 includes a cylindrical blade core with
striking platforms on both ends. Approximately five blades were
found on these sites. All cores have been personally examined by the
author.
Harris County Blade Technology
Most of the blades, all of flint, are of the "crude" type, with lateral
edges and dorsal ridges not exactly parallel to each other. Blades from
other locations made from obsidian, such as the Mexican examples,
show far more uniformity and symmetry. The majority of blades in
Harris County have a triangular cross section with only one dorsal
ridge. There are a number with two dorsal ridges. Ridge flakes also
occur with the larger blade technology.
Some statistics have been developed for Harris County blade sites
with prismatic blades divided into three classes as follows:
1. microblades -- under 9 mm. wide
2. small blades -- 9 to 12 mm. wide
3. large blades -- over 12 mm. wide
Table V shows the distribution of blade widths for site 41 HR 184.
The distribution is bimodal with peaks at the 9 mm. and 11-12 mm.
ranges. If the smaller number of blades of 10 mm. width is fortuitous,
then the microblade and small blade groups should be combined, to
give microblades to 12 mm. width and larger blades above 12 mm.
MacNeish (1964) uses 10 mm. as a maximum width for microblades,
and Taylor (1962) uses 11 mm. as a maximum width for Arctic microblades. Large blades, as used in this paper, is a relative term. By
Andersonâs (1970) definition of the Akmak assemblage, all of the large
blades in this paper would be called small, narrow blades.
In addition, blade-like objects with dorsal ridges are shown, including cortex flakes from possible core preparation. Table II is a summary
of blade size distribution. This distribution is similar for all of the
sites. Table III shows average dimensions for blades from two of these
sites.
As may be seen in Table III the average length of truncated blades is
not much shorter than for whole blades. The blades probably served
as cutting edges or hafted sideblades without much retouch. Most

retouch is on the ends of the blades, for use as scrapers and gravers.
Whole blade examples are shown as Figures 2A to 2I, ranging from
microblades to larger sizes. In addition, microliths made from blades
(including crescent, rectangular, and trapazoidal forms) also occur.
A possible aim of prismatic blade manufacture is to obtain long,
thin flakes, with higher structural strength due to the prismatic
cross-section. Thin flakes have sharp edges and are easier to retouch,
but flat, thin flakes lack strength. Occasionally, cortex flakes from
possible core manufacture were also retouched, shown as Figure 21
from site 41 HR 208.

The most common form of truncated blade has a straight oblique
truncation on one end and is rounded on the other end, illustrated as
Figures 2-0 to 2-R. This form is common in other North American
blade industries. Other common forms for end retouch are pointed
(for gravers and possibly projectile points) and blunt (for scrapers). A
number of types of retouched blades are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Figures 2K, L and M are examples of perforators. Figures 2K and 2M
are from Site 41 HR 184, and Figure 2L is from Site 41 HR 210. Striking
platforms (bulbar end) are up in all cases in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2N

a point, from several of the sites in Harris County. Figures 3-0, P and
Q, from HR 188, HR 5 and HR 184 respectively, are examples of blades
with extensive minute retouch on the pointed end.
Figures 3 R and S from Site HR 184 have notches on the bulbar end.
The notch in Figure 2S has been formed by a distinct burin blow.
Giddings (1964) reports this type of retouch to microblades in Alaska,
and they are also known in the Siberian Mesolithic (Okladnikov
1969).
Some blades may not have been used at all, and represent debris
from core preparation. This could especially apply to some of the
smaller microblades. In Harris County sites, where samples are large
enough to be statistically meaningful, prismatic blades comprise
about five to ten percent of the total flakes collected, excluding fine
chipping debris.
Blade cores and possible cores from Harris County are shown in
Figures 1, 4, 5 and 7. These include the following types:
1. Wedge-shaped
The striking platform is on the edge opposite to a wedge-shaped
keel and is approximately 70 to 90 degrees from the blade surface.
These cores are similar to the Arctic and Asiatic types, but lack
retouch on the keel. An example from 41 HR 98 is shown in Figure 4
and one from 41 HR 188 is shown in Figure 5. This type has also been
found on sites 41 HR 184 and 41 KY 14.
The writer feels that the keel could have served as a method for
holding the core in a slotted device during blade making, rather than
the later combination use as a scraper, as stated by some authors. This
opinion has also been given by Irving (1962:59). These cores may be
related to the post-American Paleo-Arctic Tradition of Alaska, shown
by Anderson (1972) in his Figure 9, in that the shapes are similar,
especially in keel type geometry.
2. Poverty Point/Hopewell Type
These cores are semi-cylindrical or semi-conical in shape, a form
seemingly dependent on the conformity of the original pebble material used. The striking platform is at an acute angle of about 50 degrees.
In the Jaketown report, Ford, Phillips and Haag (1955) gave an opinion that Poverty Point and Hopewell cores were very similar. The
writer has four undated specimens from Ohio Flint Ridge that also
conform to this type description. Two examples are shown as Figures
1E and 1F from sites HR 188 and HR 184 respectively.
Ford (1969) has also noted the presence of conical blade cores in the
Ohio Hopewell. Aside from discussion in the Jaketown report, however, the relation of Poverty Point and Hopewell cores has received
little attention. Sangerâs (1970) survey of mid-latitude core and blade

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

98

traditions presented an analysis of Illinois and Ohio Hopewell blades
but without any actual specimens of cores. Based on the limited
information available, however, the writer is in agreement with the
Jaketown report that acute angle cores of the Poverty Point and
Hopewell cultures are technologically related.
Needles and perforators occur at Harris County sites, similar to
items from Jaketown. No other Poverty Point type artifacts are known
to occur at Harris County sites, however, such as are found farther east
at Avery Island.

3. Straight Polyhedral
These are straight-sided cylindrical or block shaped with striking
platforms at 90 degrees. Either end can be used as the striking platform. An example from Site 41 HR 188 is shown as Figure 1H. A
pencil-shaped microblade core of this type was found on HR 209.
4. Tapered Polyhedral
These cores are similar to conical cores, except that the blade flutes
do not curve to the end. Striking platforms are generally at an angle of
about 70 degrees. An example is shown as Figure 1-I, from HR 188.
Some of these cores resemble MacNeishâs "tongue-shaped" cores
(MacNeish 1964, Figure 89) from the Southwest Yukon. There is a
relatively flat surface on each face of a wedge, with blade facets on
both lateral edges.
5. Tabular Cores
Tabular cores from Harris County are probably simple fragments
from cores of other types. An example from 41 HR 213 is illustrated as
Figure 1A, and one from HR 184 is shown as Figure 2B.
As mentioned previously, a true tabular core was found on Site
41RE 7. It is noted that this core was found where tabular flint was
available. Blade core shapes are probably a function of lithic material
available, as well as specific core preparation techniques.

6. Casual types
A formalized method of core preparation need not be used to obtain
blades. Blades can be struck from random shaped pieces of flint
although not at a high yield of blades. These are the most difficult to
recognize as blade cores but the method was probably widely used. A
number of writers, including Tolstoy (1971) for Mexico and Gagliano
(1967) for Avery Island, Louisiana mention use of this core type. An
example from 41 HR 188 is shown as Figure 1-G.
None of the cores fouhd in Harris County exhibit elaborate preparation of the striking platform; there is some use of unprepared platforms evident. In most cases the platform was formed by a single blow
although several blows were required on Poverty Point type cores.
There is some evidence of pecking and grinding at the platform edges
such as described by Sanger (1968) for Northwest types.
Blade sites in the New World are noted for a low frequency of core
specimens when compared to the number of blades found. As far as
Harris County is concerned, this might be explained as follows:
a. Blade core fragments show that cores were reduced further to
obtain additional flakes. This is consistent with maximum use of flint
in an area where lithic material importation was required.
b. "Casual" cores are difficult to recognize.
c. Previous workers have tended to overlook blade technology.

A boat-shaped possible blade core is shown as Figure 1-C. Figure 7

A major use of microblades from Harris County sites was for the
production of microliths that resemble Eurasian and Alaskan unifacial forms used for side and end blades with the compound arrow
point. Figures 8, 9, and 10 illustrate this material for Site 41 HR 184,
with all items made from prismatic blade fragments. Side blades have
one straight lateral edge, presumably used for halting, with trimming

BLADE TECHNOLOGY

103

retouch on the opposite lateral edge. Trimming is of the steep retouch
variety, common to Eurasian microliths. Several microliths are firepopped, as occurs with dart points in the area which might indicate
damage during meat cooking.

EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS
Sites yielding evidence of blade technology seem to have a relatively wide distribution on the Texas Gulf Coast during late Archaic
and post-archaic times (Figure 6). Geographically bracketing these
Texas sites are blade producing sites in Mexico (MacNeish, 1958) and
Avery Island, Louisiana (Gagliano 1967) as well as the Poverty Point
type sites. Other evidence of cultural traffic over long periods of time
on the Gulf Coast is shown by correspondences in projectile point
styles over this area as suggested in Table IV. With blade producing
sites in northern Mexico, the entire Gulf Coast, Louisiana, Mississippi
and Florida, there may be some basis for referring to a Gulf Coast small
prismatic blade tradition in late Archaic times -- perhaps lasting
longer in some locations.
While the Houston area is the westernmost occurrence on the Gulf
Coast of Poverty Point type blade cores known to the writer this
general semi-cylindrical core type with acute angle striking platform
occurs in an earlier context at Magic Mountain, Colorado (IrwinWilliams and Irwin 1966). Along with the general distribution of
small blades on the Gulf Coast, Magic Mountain provides additional
suggestion that small blade technology did not originate at Poverty
Point but may have arrived from the Northwest. This core type is also
found in Siberia.
While the writer proposes a relationship between Poverty Point and
Magic Mountain blade cores, Cynthia Irwin-Williams (personal
communication) is of the opinion that the Magic Mountain microblade industry is in turn related to the Northwest. Griffin (1966) sees a
relationship between the Poverty Point core and blade industry and
the Arctic Denbigh complex. In the same article, he notes that the
burin did not penetrate to Poverty Point. This is not true for the South
in general, however, as the writer has found burins in Harris County;
others have reported burins in Texas (Epstein 1960, 1963) and MacNeish (1967) found burins as far south as the Tehuacan Valley in
Mexico. Blades and burins occur together on sites in Harris County, in
the Tehuacan Valley and the Catahoula Lake Archaic in central
Louisiana (Webb 1968).
Houston, Avery Island, Poverty Point sites and Illinois Hopewell
(MacNeish 1948) all share the Gary and Yarbrough point types, as
well as one of the same types of blade cores.

Figure 6 illustrates a possible, highly generalized route for the
diffusion of small blade technology to the Gulf Coast from the Northwest. This model is, of course, subject to further verification. There is
a distribution of blade sites from the assumed Bering Straits entry
point to the New World through Oregon, as summarized by MacNeish
(1964) and Sanger (1968). Blade sites between Oregon and Texas are
less well documented but are not complIetely absent. In Texas, there
are sites on the Colorado River in the Edwards Plateau, which may
relate to diffusion of blade technology from the Northwest to the Gulf
Coast.
Wedge-shaped blade cores found in Harris County are suggested as
an indication of possible northwest influence on Gulf Coast lithic
technology. Tolstoy (1971) reported one of these artifacts from the
Valley of Mexico and attributed it to indicating far northern influence.
David Sanger (personal communication) has suggested to the writer that comparison of core manufacturing systems, such as shown by
Morlan (1970) are of importance in making inter-regional comparisons of cores. It is judged that the Harris County wedge-shaped cores
employed a simple preparation process. First, a minimum number of
blows was used to obtain a wedge-shaped object. Then a single blow
was employed to form a striking patform. Little or no retouch was
used to sharpen the wedge keel. It is not surprising that some wedgeshaped blade cores do not have extensive retouch on the keel. Even a
rather blunt keel can be cradled in a slotted wood vise. In the more
common case where only one lateral edge of a wedge-shaped core is
faceted, the other sharp latera! edge could be inserted into a wood slot

106

instead of, or also with, the bottom keel. The points of comparison of
Harris County cores with Northwest types is the use of a wedgeshaped core with striking platform on the edge opposite the keel and a
single striking platform at approximately right angles to the fluted
surface. This general pattern can be found in Japan, Siberia, Alaska
and the Pacific Northwest, both with and without extensive retouch of
the keel. In the writerâs opinion, retouch of the keel simply indicates
that a bifacial technique was used to form the keel wedge shape.
It is felt that the wedge-shaped cores from the Harris County sites
conform more closely to the Northwest blade tradition as described by
Sanger (1968) than to the Paleo Arctic tradition. Side-notched, leaf
shaped and tapered stem points shown in connection with microblades at Ryegrass Coulee, Washington are also present with microblades at the Harris County sites. Irving (1972:58) states that stemmed
and notched points are connected with the Northwest microblade
tradition.
Ford presented a model for small blade technology evolving from
crude Paleo-Indian blades in Mexico and then diffusing to sites such
as Poverty Point. As the reader may note, the blade diffusion model
suggested in this paper is entirely different and implies Archaic
Period influence from the Northwest, separate from Paleo-Indian
technology.
It is recognized that much work remains before external relationships of prehistoric blade technology in Texas can be firmly established. However, a start must be made in providing models for further
testing. It is hoped that this paper will serve to stimulate further
interest in the subject.
Judging by the number of blade core types on the Gulf Coast,
probably not all blade technology can be explained as coming from a
common source. In addition to the model presented there remains the
possibility of some Mesoamerican influence and local adaptations in
technique to types of lithic materials available.
Although different blade core types may indicate varied cultural
influences, this need not be so in all cases at a given time, even though
there may be ultimate separate sources. Asiatic sites reported by
Derevianko (1969) and Medvedev (1969), for example, contain both
keeled wedge-shaped and Poverty Point type cores. The keeled cores
are called "Gobi" type. The Amur River cores reported by Derevianko,
assumed here as of the "Poverty Point" type, have a striking platform
angle of 50 degrees as in the North American occurrences and are
semi-conical. These are labeled "wedge-shaped" by Russian writers
because of the acute angle of the striking platform, as opposed to the
American usage of the same term to refer to the keeled type.

Another possible indication of Pacific Northwest influence is the
heat treatment of flint. A significant number of flint artifacts in Harris
County sites show the coloring and luster of heat treatment. IrwinWilliams and Irwin (1966) cite heat treatment as a possible Northwest
trait.
A still further possible indication of northern influence is burin
spall and spall-like artifacts with end retouch, similar to those described by Giddings (1964) for the Denbigh Flint Complex and mentioned also for the later Dorset Culture (Taylor 1962). A number of like
specimens have been found on Site 41 HR 184; the first possible
example was noticed on Site 41 HR 6. Both 10 and 25 power magnifiers were required for proper examination. Most flint spalls having
a wedge-shaped end exhibited at least some use retouch, with a few
spalls having possible purposeful retouch. Epstein (1960, Figure 1,
94) has noted this type of artifact in the Lower Pecos River Archaic.
Micro-flaking is also a possible indication of Northwest influence.
Harris County microblades and perforators show very fine retouch.
Demonstration of this has required use of 10 power magnification.
Two flakes were found on Site 41 HR 184 with graver points formed
by extremely minute pressure flaking. This kind of fine flaking is well
known from the Cape Denbigh complex in Alaska described by Giddings (1964) and encountered at the Magic Mountain site in Colorado
by Irwin-Williams and Irwin (1966).
The presence of microblades in possibly pre-ceramic context in
Harris County raises the question as to whether the bow and arrow
arrived earlier than now generally acknowledged, and whether arrows were possibly used with compound points of the Eurasian
Mesolithic variety rather than with the conventional single piece
arrow tip. A number of trimmed microblades suggest hafting as sideblades, and others as points.

COMMENTS ON ASIATIC INFLUENCES
Harris County sites surveyed by the writer show no evidence of
agriculture. A hunting and gathering way of life may have extended
here until near historic time. It appears that these sites may have
retained a number of traits that reflect an original Asian Mesolithic
origin as well as displaying the usual more local Archaic traits. Aside
from small blades, other "typical" Mesolithic traits present are: use of
the spear thrower, burins and microliths.
The persistence of Mesolithic traits into more recent periods is
paralleled in Russian Asiatic Neolithic sites, as has been noted by
Formozov (1961) and others. Griffin (1966) has cited evidence of

Asiatic influences on North America during the late Archaic as being
of possible Siberian Neolithic origin. It is the writerâs opinion that
Harris County sites furnish additional supporting evidence on such
influence. Giddings (1964) feels that microblade technology should
be termed "Mesolithic Asiatic" influence rather than Neolithic. Although somewhat outdated in certain respectsl the Jaketown report by
Ford, Phillips and Haag (1955) still seems to be viable in its discussion
of the relationship of southern US microblade sites with the Eurasian
Mesolithic. The writer (Patterson 1973) has separately presented
more detailed comments for a number of possible Asiatic and arctic
influences on southern North America.
