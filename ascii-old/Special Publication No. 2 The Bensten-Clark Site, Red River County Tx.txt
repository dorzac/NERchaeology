ABSTRACT

To date there have been no systematic controlled excavations at the Bentsen-Clark site.
While four features have been salvaged, the majority of the "salvage" involved removing the
cultural materials from the disturbed soil of sloughed river banks. Although excavation
which allowed viewing only a portion of the remains in situ is limited to a part of Feature
No. 1, a large burial pit, the associations that were observed in the other features are
accurate as reported. In the hastances where orientation, associations, and feature
characteristics were not definitely known, no attempt is made in explanation. It is
unfortunate that the features were found under the chcumstances they were, but it is hoped
that this report will mitigate a small portion of the loss.

PREFACE

The Texas ~rcheological Society annually publishes a Bulletin and several issues of a
newsletter, Texas Archeology. However, over the past decade, the tempo of archeological
research, conducted by both amateurs and professionals, has greatly accelerated. With this
surge of activity has come a great increase in the number of manuscripts submitted to the
Society for publication. Many of these papers have been quite lengthy and deserve
publication in monograph form. Therefore, in 1973, the Board of Directors of the Texas
Archeological Society decided to begin issuing a series of special publications. The Society
had released its first special publication in 1962, the Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type
Descriptions, published jointly jointly with the Texas Memorial Museum.
The present volume, authored by Larry D. Banks and Joe Winters, is the second number
in the Special Publication series, and marks what the Society hopes will be a sustained
revival of this series. Funds for this study, including partial costs of this monograph, were
made available by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Tulsa District). The Texas
Archeological Society greatly appreciates this assistance.
With the income generated through the sales of this volume, the Society anticipates the
publication of additional monographs over the next two years. The Special Publication
series is open to both descriptive (data-oriented) and theoretica! offerings, and interested
authors are urged to contact the Editors.
In closing, we would like to briefly mention one aspect of the present monograph which
will be readily apparent to the reader. Two systems of measurement, English and metric,
have been employed, in genera!, Banks and Winters have used the English system (feet,
inches, miles, acres) in reporting linear and areal measurements, while the metric system
(meters, centimeters, millimeters) has been used mainly in for measurements of cultural
features and artifacts. Certainly the trend in modem archeology is toward the use of the
metric system for all forms of measurement. But whatever system is employed, we urge
future contributors to this series to be consistent in this regard.

Larry D. Banks

I want to express my gratitude to a number of people who have contributed to this
report. Mr. Elmer Bentsen and Mr. J. Igo, Arrowhead Ranch owner and foreman, have been
courteous and helpthl in permitting access to the site. Likewise, Mr. Jim Clark has
consistentiy permitted access on his property, and he and his wife Linda have had an active
interest in the site. Their continued hospitality is greatly appreciated. In addition to
discovering the site, Keith Harmon has been involved with several of the investigations at the
site; I am particularly thankful to him for his part in the diving operation in the river
channel.
I want to thank Joe and Juanita Brown for their enduring patience while I sporadically
made sketches and measurements and attempted to make photographs of the Brown
collection. Joe has also fieely shared his observations of Feature Nos. 1 and 3. William
"Hoppy" Denison and Ginny have also exhibited their patience with my photographic
talents. "Hoppy" is responsible for inviting Gregory Perino and me to the site when Feature
No. 1 was discovered and he has been very helpt\fl in every aspect of investigation. I do not
think I can adequately express my appreciation to Quintus and Mary Herron for all their
help with this report and for their personal friendship.
Gregory Perino not only supervised the salvage of that portion of Feature No. 1 in
which. I was involved, but he has been my prime motivator in preparing this report. He is
responsible for obtaining the osteological study of the skeletal material by Dr. Jane
Buikstra and the faunal identification by Dr. Paul Parmalee. Perino has also gone to a great
dea! of trouble in photographing the artifacts and advising me on plate preparation.
R.K. Harris and Dr. Robert Bell have played significant roles in the ceramic analysis and
R.K. Harris has also provided photographs of artifacts for the report. Dr. Keith Anderson
obtained the identification of the conch shell dipper by Dr. Elmer Cheatum, and he, too,
photographed some of the arfifacts.
In addition to visiting the site with R.K. Harris, Hal Story and me, Dr. Dee Ann Story
has helped me considerably in our discussions on Caddoan archaeology, and she obtained
the skeletal analysis of Feature No. 6 by Dr. Claud Bramblett.
I want to express my thanks to Dr. Paul Parmalee, Illinois State Museum, for his faunal
identification and to Dr. Claud Bramblett, University of Texas at Austin, for his skeletal
analysis.
As will be noticed in the report, without the osteological study by Dr. Jane Buikstra and
Diedre Fowler, the data presented in this report would not adequately reflect the siteâs
significance.. Betty Winters has also helped with the ceramic study, typing, and helping
prepare the plates.
The Tulsa District Corps of Engineers has provided use of maps and aerial photographs,
and the District Soils Laboratory performed mechanical soils analyses of the strata
associated with Features 1 and 3.
I want to express a special note of thanks to Dr. Waldo Wedel and his wife Mildred, for
taking photographs at the site and making them available for the report.
The manuscript has been typed in its different stages by Mrs. Joy Barnes and Mrs. Jan
Cooper. Mrs. Sandra Carroll typed the final manuscript. Helen and Karen Rowland helped a
great deal with the pottery restorations, and Michael Freeman helped with the pottery
reconstructions.
Rex Wilson edited the original draft of the paper and his comments and criticism were
well taken and appreciated. Dave Dibble has been very helpful with his advice and criticism
in preparing the plates and Drs. Thomas Hester and Harry J. Sharer are to be thanked for
their advice during the final editing of the report.
David Steele has devoted his time and talents in making measurements and notes on the
artifacts, preparing maps and drawings, and visiting the site to help with field mapping. His
help has been greatly appreciated.
And not to be taken for granted is the continual help in all phases of the report, the
patience and encouragement by Billie, Stephanie and Nathan, my wife and children.

INTRODUCTION

The Bentsen-Clark site (4 ! RR41)is located on the south bank of the Red River in Red
River County. The site was discovered by Keith Harmon during a fishh~g trip on September
25, 1969. He noticed skeletal material, pottery and a large green celt on the surface of a
talus slope resulting from the sloughing of the bank. He reported the site to three members
of the McCurtain County Anthropological Society who investigated the site.
Quintus Hel~on, Joe Brown, William "Hoppy" Denison, and Keith Harmon returned to
the site and collected artifacts and bones from the loose talus. An excavation attempt to
locate the source of the artifacts revealed a mass of human bones about 3 ft thick and 6 ft
wide above what was later determh~ed to be the floor of a grave. Additional sloughing of the
bank nearly buried the excavators, and then on the morning of the 26th, at the request of
Hoppy Denison and Quintus Herron, Gregory Perino and Banks visited the site.
The senior author has made approximately twenty separate visits to the site over the
past three years. Paul Ferguson and Dr. Frank Soday visited the site and attempted to locate
features with an anomoly detector, but the effort was unsuccessful.
The soils types are classified by the Unified Soils Classification System, and the
mechanical analyses were performed by ASTM standards.
The geology at the site is confusing even though the cuts made by the river have been
equivalent to viewing three different excavated trenches approximately 2300 ft in length.
The typical archeological interpretation of the stratigraphy at any one locality as based on a
few test pits would be completely misleading at this particular site. The current exposure of
the bank (Fig. 26) shows the buried occupation zone as Horizon C in one locality, it
becomes Horizon B in another locality and then within 50 lin ft, the stratum is buried under
eleven sterile strata. Without seeing an entire cross section, the normal archeological
excavation in any of the given localities would not adequately define the stratigraphic
sequence.

Natural Environment

The physiographic environmental conditions in the immediate area of the Bentsen-Clark
site probably bear slight resemblance to the area during the sequences of Caddoan
occupation. The impressive complexity of the geologic context at the site evidences the
alternate conditions brought about by the meandering, agrading river. While the Â°âGreat Log
Raft" had significant environmental impact upon the lower river throughout the greater part
of the Fulton Aspect, smaller log jams farther upstream must have had an impact by causing
local flooding. In fact the greatest amount of drifting logs which clogged the lower river was
believed to come from the general area of the river in which the Bentsen-Clark site is
located. With reference to the Red River between the Kiamichi confluence and Fulton,
Arkansas, Captain J.W. Willard wrote in 1892 (20 years after removal of the !og.raft):
The banks are covered with trees constantly caving or sliding into the river, and if
removal of the obstructions from the channel were continued and the timber
cleared from the banks to stop further accumulation ... there would be less
drift to contend with in the river below Fulton. (U.S. Congress, 1892)

INTRODUCTION

Since completion of the Denison Dam in 1944, the Red River has not been so active in
its alternate roles of erosion and agrading as it was prior to that date, and although the
sediment load of the river is great today, there is no doubt that it was much greater. As an
example, between 1908 and 1936, ten major ox-bow cut-offs occurred between the
Kiamichi and the Little River confluences of the Red River. For this same period of time
only two ox-bow cut-offs occurred between Denison, Texas, and the Kiamichi River. There
have been no major ox-bow cut-offs in this area since construction of the Denison Dam, but
the current average annual loss of land attributed to the river between Denison and Index,
Texas, is 1,000 acres (U.S. Congress; 1968: 58).
The section of the Red River between its confluences with the Kiamichi and Little River
is hydrologically different above and below these points. The 163.8 river mile section has an
average fall of 0.8 ft per mi; whereas, above the confluence of the Kiamichi (river mile 627),
the average fall is 2.2 ft per mi. In cross section the river here is narrower and shallower,
with the top banks an average of 1,300 ft in width and the low-water widths 450 ft. The
bank averages 17 ft in height above normal flow, and the south bank tends to be higher. The
river carries more sediments below the Kiamichi and the percentage of clays in suspension
increases in comparison to sand (U.S. Congress, 1968: 209). At Arthur City the annual
sediment load is 6 million tons and at Fulton, Arkansas, the annual load is 25 million tons
(U.S. Congress, 1968: 39). This fact is probably a result of greater caving rather than the
influence of the Kiamichiâs sediments. The flood plain at Fulton is 8 mi in width, but the
average near the Bentsen-Clark site is about 5 air line miles from southwest to northeast.
Red River floods have been numerous in recorded history, and in this section of the
river twelve floods occunâed between 1900 and 1936, with the three greatest floods in !908,
1927, and 1930, respectively. Sedimentation was also greater in 1908 because the average
length of inundated floodplains was 20 compared to 12 days in 1927 (U.S. Congress, 1968:
370). Records of actual silt deposition in a single flood are not well documented because of
the lack of control points for such measurements, but it is not uncommon to have several
feet of sediment deposited at one time. This is not surprising considering the sediment load
of the river. The implication of these data have direct effects not only on the Bentsen-Ctark
site, but on countless numbers of additional archaeological sites in the Red River Valley.
Ten feet of sterile soil overlie a portion of the latest occupation (post t300 A.D.) of the
Bentsen-Clark site, and burial depths of much older sites are difficult to even estimate.
There can be little doubt that the lack of Paleo-lndian sites along this portion of Red River
is attributable t~) its agrading characteristics.

Climatological Data

The following inforlnation is taken from the U.S. Weather Bureau statistics for a 29-year
period from 1931-1960 (except where noted) along the Red River in northeast Texas.
The average growing season is eight months, with the first and last killing frost in the
middle of November and March, respectively. The average winter temperature for the
coldest month (January) is 44.9 degrees F, and the coldest recorded temperature between
1931-1960 was -19 degrees F at Idabel, Oklahoma. The highest average monthly
temperature is in August with 83.4 degrees F., and the hottest recorded temperature was
118 degrees F at Hugo on August 10, 1936. The yearly average rainfall is 45.6 in, with a

4

maximum and minimum monthly average of 5.33 in in May and 2.69 in August. In contrast
to these last figures, the year of 1873 had an annual rainfall of 109.38 in, and 19!0 had the
lowest yearly average of 25.30 in. Snowfall occurs an average of once every two to three
years, with an average of 2.4 in. The prevailing wind is from the south at an average of 11
mph, but the highest recorded monttily wind at Fulton, Arkansas, in July, 1936, was 77
mph.
Site Location and Geographical Setting

The site is located on the south bank of the Red River north central Red River County,
Texas, in a region known physiographically as the Western Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman,
1938:117), and in the northwestern edge of tile East Texas Timber Belt of tile province.
This area is also referred to as the Interior Dissected Plains (Johnson, 1931:88).
The site is also near the western extremity of the Austroriparian Biotic province (Dice,
1943: 18-21). The biotic province extends eastward to the east coast and encompasses all
the southern coastal states. Likewise, the Gulf Coastal Plain encompasses roughly the same
area. Actually this region of northeast Texas is near the contact zone of the Woodlands and
the Eastern Cross Timbers of tile Plains. Tile area is characterized by rolling hills above the
river valley, with a predominance of timber, but with interspersed natural meadows or
prairies. Johnson (193!: 92) expresses his opinion that the area was more heavily forested in
past history than it is today.
The area is underlain by Upper Cretaceous formations which largely determine the
surface features and soil types. The Upper Cretaceous formations strike generally N 70
degrees E and dip about 40 ft per mi to the south (Davis, 1960: 13). The outcrops of
Cretaceous rocks consequently produce a high ridge between the Red and Sulphur river
valleys which trend east-west parallel to the strike of the bedding. Because of its
southeastward flow in this area, Red River has cut its channel diagonally across the
geological formations which outcrop about 8 mi to the west and 5 mi to the east of the
Bentsen-Clark site. The fluviatile and alluvial terraces in this immediate area overlie the
bedrock by approximately 110 ft (Davis, 1960: 49). The underlying formations are the
Bonham Clay, Blossom Sand, and the Tokio which are separated in Texas but after
extending eastward into Oklahoma they are undifferentiated and included in the Tokio
formation (Miser, 1954).
The Blossom Sand is primarily a quartz sand and is calcareous, glauconitic, and
ferruginous. Severe leaching has produced mineral products in the form of hematite and
limonite concretions.
The Bonham formation consists primarily of marls and clays, and glauconite is locally
abundant throughout the formation, but especially so near the middle.
The Tokio formation ha Texas consists of quartz sand, clays, and gravel (Texas Geologic
Atlas).
These formations have not been adequately studied for prehistoric usage as economic
products, but they produce the minerals for manufacture of red and yellow ochre (hematite
and limonite) and green (bentonitic clays and glauconitic sands) pigments. Davis (1960:13)
believes these Upper Cretaceous formations contain better quality commercial clays than do
those of the older Washita group which are used for manufacture of bricks.
The upland terraces separating the geologic outcrops from the present day flood plain

INTR OD UCTION

terraces of the river are of Itlinoisian age and referred to as fluviatile terrace QT3 in the
Texas Geologic Atlas. This older terrace makes an abrupt rise of about 50 ft above the
relatively flat Wisconsin terraces on which the Bentsen-Clark site is located about t mi to
the northeast (see Fig. 2).
The terrain of the Bentsen-Clark site is characterized by a series of three terraces, all of
which are Wisconsian or younger in age. They are listed here in chronological order from
youngest and lowest to the oldest and highest. However, the entire sequence does not
encompass a great length of time. The terms used here as T-1 correspond to the floodplain
complex defined by Frye and Leonfird (1963: 13) and to the recent alluvium (AL)in the
Texas Geologic Atlas; T-2 and T-3 correspond to the fluviatile terrace QT1 in the Texas
Geologic Atlas.
The first terrace (T-l) is east and below the site location. The soil is deep silty sand and
is recent in age. The scar of the previous river channel is still preserved in the sandy soil. This
terrace is t2 to 15 ft above the gravel bar forming along the north side. In all probability
this terrace represents the location of the river channel during most, if not all, of the
occupation of the site.
The second terrace (T-2) is approximately 15 to 18 ft above T-1. The surface soil is red
sandy clay and the soil type is referred to as Yahola-Miller soils by the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service. The soils vary from (Yahola) a "light reddish brown calcareous very
fine sandy loam" to (Miller) a "dark reddish brown crumbly calcareous clay" (Frye and
Leonard, 1963: 14). These soils are better for agriculture than the higher terrace soils
because of the nutrients contained in the more recent river-laid deposits. The upland soils
have been severely leached.
Terrace T-3 is approximately 5 to 8 ft higher than T-2 which lies to the north and the
east of T-3. An old ox-bow scar (Fig. 4, A,B) separates T-2 and T-3 and it dessects the site in
a curving arc to the south from a. point near the northwest edge of the site to the center
point along the eastern escarpment of T-2. The level surface to the south of the channel scar
is approximately 8 to 10 ft above the surface of the scar, but the elevation is approximately
the same as the top of the cut-bank of the present day channel. Evidently this low area was
a slough during the occupation of the site. The identical environmental setting may still be
seen in portions of McCurtain County, Oklahoma, in the areas where the s!oughs have not
been drained and the timber cleared off.
These two terraces are of late geologic age and are classic examples of the Cooke terrace
identification in that the,
Â¯..physiographic expression, fossils, immature surface soils, and contained lndian
hearths all confirm its late Wisconsin (post Bradyan or post Two-Creekan) age ....
The surface of this terrace exhibits preselwed channel scars and other evidences of
the eroding and depositing channel that formed it. (Frye and Leonard, 1963:27).
Much of the recent channel scar fill may be attributed to sedimentation resulting from
cultivation within the past 150 years, but the thick red steri.le clays exhibited between the
earliest and latest Caddoan occupation have to be a result of intense flooding.

Stratigraphy
Since 1962 the river has gradually swung to the east from a pivot point about 1Â½ mi
north of the western edge of the site. This north-south axis of the channel has moved about

Â½ mi to the east and is now flowing south into the Bentsen-Clark property at a right angle to
the bank (Fig. 1 ) before making a sharp bend back to the east. This head-on confrontation is
resulting in undercutting the terrace in which the site is located. The river has cut into the
terrace a distance of approximately 850 ft. By using a planimeter, it has been estimated that
20 acres have been stripped from the Bentsen-Clark property since 1962.
Four major periods of sloughing between September, 1969, and May, 1972, exposed
four different soil profiles in an arc of the river bend for a distance averaging Â½ mi. In
September, 1969, at the time Feature Nosi 1 and 2 were found, the exposed bedding was
nearly horizontal to the surface and monotonously consistent. At the extreme eastern edge
of the site, above the recent alluvial soil, the Cooke terrace rises about 15 ft in a 10 degree
slope to the west forming the eastern crest of the second terrace. The uppermost 10 ft of
the exposed profile consisted of lean sandy clays overlying a thick stratum of fine tan sand.
The stratum of sand was a buried sand bar (Fig. 6) with the axis dipping to the southwest
and enclosed by a stratum of sterile clay on the east. It thinned to the west and pinched out
about 700 ft west of the Bentsen-Clark property line.
Horizon "A" was a lean red sandy clay, 48 cm in depth. Horizon "B" was a dark gray
clay containing flecks of charcoal, an occasional sherd of pottery, and fragments of deer
bone. Although the stratum represented a single consistent unit, the cultural material was
sparse and located in isolated areas. Horizon "C" was a sterile red sandy clay, containing
shells of fresh water snails.
Horizon "C" was a fine tan sand representing the buried sand bar. Its thickness at the
deepest point was undetermined because of the talus cover at lower elevations, but it
exceeded 8 ft. The soil forming a bench below the sand area, and immediately above the
water level was a red heavy clay (C1-Ch) containing small pebbles of gravel about Â¼ in
diameter and decomposing mussel shells.
The second period of sloughing, in May 1970, uncovered Feature No. 3, but the soil
profile was not substantially different from the previous exposure. Then in late summer or
early fall of 1971, a third period of sloughing occurred, and for the first time, an isometric
concept of stratigraphy was possible. The section of exposed bank was approximately 150 ft
farther south than the exposure of 1969. The contact between the upper clays and the
buried sand bar was now at a depth of 15 ft below the surface, dipping 5 degrees to the
west, and still tapering both horizontally and in depth to the south. The sand bar extended
about 500 ft west of the fenced property line. The soil horizons were undulating
conformably and two small channel scars were now exposed with sterile soil filling the
channels. The dark gray clay containing charcoal and sherds contained an isolated pocket of
fine sand 20 ft in length and a maximum of 4 ft in depth. The location of the sand lense was
slightly east of the property line. Large anaounts of charcoal were now visible in the split
strata above and below the pocket of sand. Seven thin alternate sand and clay strata overlay
the dark gray clay zone containing charcoal and occasional sherds. At the surface another
dark gray clay zone identical to the lower zone was exposed with a thickness of 60 cm (23.5
in).
Then on December 17, 1971, a major flood caused the most extensive sloughing of the
bank. Due south of the general area of Feature Nos. 1 and 3, the river had cut into the bank
approximately 300 ft. After the flood waters receded, the site was visited, rough maps made
of the profile, and Feature No. 6 salvaged. The upper dark gray zone was exposed at the
surface for a distance of about 200 ft from the extreme eastern edge of the site. It dipped
with undulations to the west. The two drainage scars were now cross sectioned by the bank

and the surface was no longer horizontal, but divided into three sections averaging about 5
ft higher in elevation than the beds of the dissecting drainage scars. The sterile strata below
the surface were conformable to the surface elevations.
In early April, 1972, the site was revisited, and some additional sloughing had taken
place (Fig. 3). The lower midden-like stratum was no longer visible. The dark gray stratum,
Horizon B, near the surface was exposed for approximately 1,600 ft. The stratum pinched
out at the edge of the eastern most drainage scar. Midden material was not extensive in the
stratum, but two main areas of concentration were found. These are discussed in Feature
No. 8.

SITE DESCRIPTION

12

SITE DESCRIPTION
The site, although situated on relatively high terraces which have been previously
described (T-2 and T-3), is mostly known from buried features which have been exposed by
the river. The site lies between elevations 350 and 365 ft ms!. It is considered to extend for
a distance of approximately 2500 ft south of the river bank across an abandoned ox-bow
scar. The cross section of the northern portion of the Site cunâentty reveals a total length of
about 1600 lin ft of cultural stratigraphy. The total area referred to encompasses about 145
acres, and because of this extensive area, the site may, in reality, represent two different
sites separated chronologically and physiographically by the abandoned channel scar.
The site area on Terrace T-3 above the south of the abandoned channel scar contains the
only remaining visible features (4 and 5) of cultural origin. The relationship between the
areas to the north and to the south of the channel scar is still unknown. Presently known
data suggest that the channel scar was a slough during the time of occupation and that the
terraces were mostly timbered. The geologic evidence presented in the recent channel fill
above the latest occupation zone contradicts an earlier concept that the northern portion of
the site lay to the north of Red River during the period of occupation associated with
Features 1 and 3.

EXCAVATION

The only excavation conducted at the site so far consists of uncontrolled exploration in
Feature No. 1. The excavations performed by Quintus Herron, William Denison, Joe Brown,
and Keith Harmon on September 25, 1969, consisted of talus removal and resulted in
exposing bundle burials above what was later determined as the grave floor. A second period
of sloughing stopped the excavation and nearly crushed the men. The caving resulted in
additional loss of Feature No. 1 and completely covered the previously exposed remains
under three large blocks of hard packed clay. Each block was approximately 8 by 8 by 10
ft.
On the morning of September 26, the remainder of the feature was excavated. The
overhanging bank made any excavation attempts dangerous, and additional sloughing could
not be controlled. By undercutting the fallen blocks of clay, they were rolled down the talus
into the river. Skeletal materials, sherds, three arrowpoints, and a shell pendant were
recovered from the previous talus slope.
A vertical cut was made in the talus until the cultural materials were again exposed. A
trench was then extended parallel to the bank approximately 6 m in length and 1 m deep.
Once the pit floor was exposed, the disturbed fill above it was removed. A biface (Fig. 13,
A) was found on the floor of the shaft grave slightly to the south of the center of the pit.
The specimen was not associated with any skeletal remains or other artifacts.
As the remaining burials were uncovered, talus material continued to drift over the
exposed areas. Maintaining a vertical face or a plane floor was almost impossible because of
the instability of the fine sand. One man constantly watched the overhead bank to warn the
others if the bank began to collapse. The undisturbed portion of the feature represented less
than one-fourth of the original dimensions. The upper portion of five burials were exposed
and laid out. The excavations were conducted as rapidly but as carefully as possible. In
attempting to locate the original pit walls, three additional burials were found at inclined
positions above the landward from the pit floor. These were removed by vertical excavations
parallel to the bank.
At a height of 1.5 m above the floor in the southeast edge of the excavation, a mass of
red ochre about 30 cm in diameter was mixed with the sand and clay backfill. A final
troweling of the wall exposed a cache (Fig. 9, H-M) of six teeth, three black bear and three
cougar canines. The cache was 1.68 m above the grave floor and 90 cm west of the ochre.
The positions of the ochre and the teeth seem to indicate a final offering during the
prehistoric backfilling operations.

CULTURAL FEATURES

Feature No. 1
This feature (Fig. 7, A, B) was a circular shaft burial 3.8 m deep below the surface, and
at least 4.1 m in diameter. A deposit of sterile red sandy clay 48 cm in depth (Horizon A)
overlay the dark reddish gray (Horizon B) clay containing midden materials. The upper two
horizons were conformable over Horizon C with no indications of intrusive excavation, so
the original surface from which the burial pit was excavated was about 1 m (39 in) lower
than the present day surface. This would have placed the original depth of the burial pit at
2.9 m.
After the pit had penetrated the fine light tan sand for a depth of 0.9 m, a 7.6 cm layer
of pink sand was spread evenly over the floor. Twilled (split) cane matting was then placed
on the floor before any bodies or artifacts were placed in the grave. Since only a fragment of
the cane matting was preserved, the matting of the entire floor is strictly supposition.
Possibly, individual sleeping mats were used.

The skeletal remains which were still intact upon the floor and not disturbed by the
caving bank were confined to the upper portions of five individuals from the abdominal
region up. The bones and sherds were crushed flat and at first appeared to be a random mass
without any order. After cleaning the soil from the skeletal remains, it was determined that
Skeleton Nos. 1 and 3 had been placed side by side with a space of about 30 cm between
shoulders in an extended supine position with the heads to the south. Also, the head of
Skeleton No. 1 was lying on its left side facing west. Skeletons 2 and 4 were then placed in
identical positions, but to both sides and on top of Skeleton No. 3, with the heads at a
shoulder level of 1 and 3. With Skeleton No. 1 was a deer ulna awl and sherds of a plain
vessel. Green pigment mixed with coarse grained sand was spread over the abdominal region
of No. 1 or beside Skeleton No. 1. The vessel and pigment had been placed over the breast
of Skeleton No. 1 and at the right side of Skeleton No. 2. The only complete vessels to be
reconstructed from the mass of sherds associated with this area are a Spiro Engraved bottle
(Vessel No. V-48), and a small Spiro Engraved "seed jar" (Vessel No. V-52).
Skeleton No. 5 was also in an extended supine position with a gap of approximately 45
cm between it and Skeleton No. 4. A shallow vessel (V-57) was reconstructed from some of
the sherds, and basal bowl fragments of a pipe of Graves-Chapel variety were found in the
abdominal region.
The cultural and skeletal material on the pit floor were crushed flat, and an accretion of
calcium carbonate partially cemented the sherds and bones together. The broken edges of
the sherds were covered with the residue, as well as the inside and outside surfaces, which
would seem to indicate breakage prior to backfilling operations. The complete vessels at
elevations above the pit floor had minor amounts of the calcareous accretions.

In removing what was thought to be backfill around the south edge of the pit it was
noticed that the sand floor of the pit did not extend as far south as the apparent backfill
did. About 2 ft south of the edge of the pit floor, Skeleton No. 6 was found lying in an
extended position with the head to the east, but with the body curved peripheral to the
edge of the pit and lying at a 10 degree angle. The head was approximately 25 cm higher
than the feet, which were 30 cm above the floor of the grave. A Holly Fine engraved jar
(Vessel No. V-53) and a small vessel with loop handles (V-56) were found with Skeleton No.
6. The Holly vessel contained the femur of a gray squirrel, which was found between the
"cemented" sherds during cleaning operations. Skeleton No. 7 was in a similar position,
lying peripheral to the southwest edge of the pit with the head to the southeast. The body
was inclined with the head approximately 30 cm higher than the feet. This individual was
supine with a miniature Sanders water bottle (Vessel No. V-54) and a Spiro engraved bottle
(V-51) on its chest. Upon removing the vessels from above the skeleton, bones of another
individual were found to be recessed about 45 cm farther back into the pit walt and above
Skeleton No. 7. Like Skeleton No. 6, the head was to the southeast and higher in elevation
than the feet, but this skeleton was approximately 50 cm farther south. Skeleton No. 8 was
lying on its right side with the face to the north. An intact undesignated engraved bottle
(Vessel No. V-50) was above the left shoulder of Skeleton No. 8.

Artifact Descriptions
The artifacts associated with Feature No. 1 consists of five categories of materials which
include: (1) teeth, shell, bone, and antler; (2) stone; (3) copper; (4) ceramics; and, (5) cane.
The artifacts are described individually under each category. Two Of the most unusual
artifacts were found on August 22, 1970, and are included with the materials from Feature
No. 1, although the feature was excavated nearly a year earlier. On August 22, while soil
profiles were being mapped, a few sherds and human bone fragments were found on the
talus below the original position of Feature No. 1. When additional bones were found in the
mud at the riverâs edge, mud probing and diving were begun in the river. In an area of about
5 sq ft, and under about 4Â½ ft of water and 1 ft of mud, a human mandible, three femurs, a
tim sherd, a large biface, and a conch shell dipper (Fig. 8, A,B) were recovered.

Category 1 : Teeth, Antler, Bone and Shell
Teeth. The teeth are all canines and represent the remains of only two species Felis
concolor (cougar) and Ursus americanus (black bear).
Figures 9 H, I and J are cougar canines with lengths of 5.0, 5.5, and 6.1 cm, respectively.
All three of the solid roots of the teeth are biconica!ly perforated and Figure 9, 1 is grooved.
The black bear canines, Figs. 9,K,L and M, are 5.0, 5.9, and 6.2 cm, respectively. An
attempt to perforate Fig. 9,K resulted in flattening and cracking the thin hollow root. Figs.
9,L and 9,M were not perforated or grooved. The six specimens were in a cluster 1.68 m
above the pit floor and at the central southern edge of the pit. The fact that the specimens
are closely matched in size and were in a cluster appears to indicate a matched set, possibly
as a necklace, thiown in with the grave fill.
Another single cougar canine, Fig. 11 ,F, was found on the talus slope.
Antler. The tips of three antlers, probably white tail deer, were recovered from the
feature. Figs. 11 ,G and 11,H were in the talus. Figure 9,D was associated with Skeleton No.
1, and had been altered by cutting the point of the tine. The large end of the specimen has a
fresh break. It is 8.4 cm in length and 1.9 cm ha width.
Bone. Bone artifacts are represented in the feature as hair pins (both effigy and plain),
ornaments, and a single awl.
The awl (Fig. 9,C) is made from a split deer ulna. The pointed tip of the specimen has
been recently broken, and the shaft was broken in half when found. The bone is polished
and exhibits abrasion marks both laterally and longitudinally along the blade. The specimen
is 11.6 cm in length, 5 mm thick, and an average of 10 mm in width.
Bone hairpins are represented by four separate types. All of the types are polished, and
one type (snake effigies) was overlaid with copper. The types are separated primarily by
size.
!. This type (Fig. 9,B) is made from a thick, split ulna (possibly human) although the
alteration has made identification difficult. The proximal end of the specimen which still
retains evidence of the bone joint is flattened and flared for a distance of about 4 cm. At
this point, the bone is rounded with a diameter of 7 mm. The specimen has lateral abrasions
or cuts on the shaft of the pin.
2. The largest pin (Fig. 9,G) is rounded from the proximal to the distal end with a
maximum thickness of 9 mm, and like Figure 9,B, the proximal end retains evidence of the
limb joint. The pin is highly polished and is slightly curved. The total length is 18.0 cm.

20

CULTURAL Ft~ TURES

3. Snake effigies are represented by two broken specimens (Figs. 9,E and 9,F). The
head of the largest specimen is 12 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter. The total length of
both specimens is unknown. The average diameter of the largest pin is 5 mm and the average
diameter of the smaller is 3 ram. The carved eyes of both pins originally had some type of
inlay, probably shell.
4. The fourth type is represented by eight fragments of polished bone pins which could
not be fitted together. They varied in length from 13 mm to 7 cm, and had an average
diameter slightly less than 3 mm.
An unusual bone specimen (Fig. 11,E) probably represents one-half of a double-cymbal
earspool. It is 2 mm in thickness and flares from a broken edge around the central
perforation with a diameter of 1.8 cm to 4.3 cm at the outer rim. The perforation is 1.7 cm
in diameter. The concave specimen is 8 1ran in height, and the inner surface of the concavity
was copper covered.

Another unusual bone specimen (Fig. 11,D) which was possibly some type of hair
ornament was recovered from the talus. The ornament was propeller shaped if the portion
beyond the broken edge was symmetrical (which is reasonable to assume). The center "hub"
of the specimen is 2.2 cm in width and 1.7 cm in length. The blade-like portion measures
1.4 cm wide at the hub and 2.1 cm at the rectangular end. The average thickness is 2 mm
and alightly concave-convex in cross section. The overall length is 7.9 cm.
Shel!. The shell artifacts represent both marine and fresh water shell fish. By counting
individual specimens (beads, etc.) shell is the highest percentage of artifactual materials
represented in the feature. This material was used for both tools (hoes) and ornaments.
Shell Dipper. The shell dipper (Fig. 8) was not found in the talus or in the excavation,
but in the mud of the river below the point where the feature was located. The specimen
was examined by the late Dr. Elmer Cheatum, Southern Methodist University, who was
unable to identify the species because of the alternation, but he classified it as Busycon sp.
(Whelk). Dr. Cheatum expressed his opinion that the shell was not picked up on the Texas
Gulf CQast and that its size indicates an origin in deep waters. The dipper is 35 cm in length,
16.8 cm in width, and the maximum depth of the basin is 13cm. The underside of the shell
and the columella were removed and the cut edges ground. Four worm holes are present at
the bottom of the dipper basin, two of which did not completely perforate the shell, but all
four holes had been repaired with shell inlays. One inlay is still intact (Fig. 8,B). The entire
surface of the shell has been ground and polished.
Shell Hoes. A total of eight perforated mussel shell hoes was recovered. They varied in
size from a worn out tool of 6 cm in diameter to a specimen of !2.5 cm in length and 8 cm
âin width (Fig. 10,F). The inside rim of the valve had been ground flat to form a smooth
surface and remove the bulb of the hinge.
Musse! Shell Pendants. Eleven complete specimens and six fragments of shell pendants
were recovered. Two of the specimens (Fig. 10,A) are more than twice the size of the others
(Fig. 10,B), but they seem to have served a similar function as ornaments. They vary in size
from 6.2 cm in length to 5.7 cm, and 2.4 cm to 2.3 cm in width. The biconically drilled
perforations vary between 4 and 5 mm in diameter. The pendants were cut longitudinally
from mussel shells parallel to the hinge. The cut edges have been ground. The specimen in
Fig. 10, B (8) has two perforations.
Earspools. Two rectangular ornaments (Figs. 11,I and 11,J)made of conch shell may
represent a single artifact, but they appear to have been a matched set. One specimen is
complete, and it is assumed that both were identical in size based on the known
measurements of Fig. 11,I. The complete specimen is 5. t by 5.2 cm and 2 mm thick. It is
concave-convex with a central perforation of 4 mm. On the surfaces of both specimens is an
area of 2.2 cm in diameter which indicates an object was held in place against the surfaces of
the ornaments. It is suggested that an object like the shell bead (Figure 11,L) was attached
to both sides of the ornament.
Shell Beads. A total of 103 beads made of conch shell was recovered. They represent
three distinct types: (1) a barrel-shaped bead (Fig. 10,E [3 and 4) made from the columella,
averaging 1.5 cm in length and !0 mm in diameter; (2) wide beads with a small perforation
(Fig. 10,E (1 and 2) and, (3) narrow beads that have been ground to a minimum diameter
(Figure 10,D). Two other conch shell bead-like objects (Figs. l l,K and 11,L) are much
larger than the others and are believed to be part of a dual component ornament (earspools)
rather than beads.
Fifty-three beads (Fig. 10,C) are made from Common Atlantic Marginella (Prunum
apicinium) shells. The method of manufacture is unusual in that the surface of the apex was
ground fiat until the largest and outermost whorl was penetrated, resulting in an oblong
perforation. The beads average 1.2 cm in length and 8 mm in diameter.

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

Category 2: Stone Artifacts

Limestone
Pipes.
Effigy Pipe (Figs. 12,F and 12,G). The specimen was found in the talus material near the
eastern edge of the feature. This human effigy is carved from a fine grained white limestone.
The figure is 17 cm in height with a 4 mm top knot in the center of the head. The maximum
width (at the elbow) is 8.5 cm. The pipe bowl is broken in half and held in the lap of the
figure; consequently, the stem and outer half of the bowl is missing. Charring in the bowl
indicates actual use of the pipe. If the stem extended out fiom the bowl as would be
expected, it would appear to be a phallic symbol. The bowl is flared and measures 4.6 cm
(inside diameter) at the rim and 4.2 cm deep. Forked eye motifs are carved in both temporal
areas, and the hair is coiled clockwise in an occipital knot. The choker around the neck is
plain. There are many shallow cracks in the entire figure, possibly a result of heat. This
effigy shares similar characteristics, i.e, hair style, with an effigy pipe fiâom the George C.
Davis site (Harry Sharer, personal communication).
Limestone Pipe (Fig. 12,E). This pipe is carved from the same type fine grained
limestone as the human effigy. It also exhibits heat cracks and charring. An interesting
repair had been made in the distal end of the stem. Perforation from this end was begun and
the hole was angling too far upward and to one side. A broken fragment of the same type
stone was then fitted into the abandoned hole. The pipe is 4.1 cm in height and the outside
bowl diameter is 5.5 cm. The bowl wall thickness is 9 mm and the inside diameter of the
bowl is 2.3 cm. The diameter of the stem perforation is 5 mm.
Ear Spools
Limestone Earspool (Fig. 1 !,C). This specimen is carved from a white limestone very
similar to the limestone pipes, but the texture is not as fine. The spool is broken in half with
the back flange of the pulley-like figure missing. The spool is 8.4 cm in diameter and the
central perforation is 1.2 cm in diameter. The thickness of the front flange is 4 ram. The
Â¯ spool is decorated by a four-armed whorl or a stylized swastika, and the design is engraved
to a depth slightly less than 2 ram. A green stain from copper is present on the fact of the
spool.
Siliceous Shale Earspool (Figs. 11,A and 11,B). These two earspools represent the only
specimens made of gray-black siliceous shale. The reverse sides of the spools are flat and the
faces are concave with a depth of 3 mm at the center. The faces are 6.8 cm in diameter and
the reverse sides are 5.8 cm in diameter. The center perforations are 1 cm at the face and 1.6
cm at the back and appear to have been bored from the face-side. An interesting feature of
the spools is the manner in which the peripheral pulley-like grooves were made. The insides
of the front and back flanges were carved in a series of small cuts averaging 1 mm in width
and 4 mm in length toward the center of the spools. The insides of the front flanges had to
be cut in two concentric rows rather than one. The cuts were made at an average 5 degree
angle measured clockwise from an imaginary line across the center of the spools. Possibly a
tool made from a small beaver mandible or something similar was used. The insides of the
grooves were not ground enough to remove the cut marks. A fibrous material resembling
inner cedar bark had been wrapped inside the grooves. The spools were made of identical
materials; all the dimensions are identical, and both spools have been overlaid with copper,

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

which was responsible for the cane mat preservation on Figure ! t,B. Obviously the spools
were a matched set. Figure 11,A has the beginning cuts of an engraved design on the face
similar to the motif on the limestone spool (Fig. 11,C). The fact that the design is
incomplete possibly indicates that the spools were not completely finished by the artisan or
were finished rather hastily.
Green Siliceous Shale or Greenstone Celts. Two celts, Figs. 16,A and 16,B, are possibly
made of green stone, although they may also be made of green siliceous shale. The fact that
the two celts were examined by the author only once is the reason for hesitation in positive
identification of the material. The rock is a fine grained light green siliceous material and
Fig. 16,B exhibits dark brownish black laminations identical to the green siliceous shale
which outcrops in the extreme southwestern area of the Ouachita Mountains.
Fig. 16,B is 32.1 cm in length, 5.8 cm in width at the bit, and is lenticutar with a
thickness of 2 cm (estimated). Fig. 16,A is t0.0 cm in length and 3.0 cm maximum width
(estimated).
Quartzitic Sandstone Celts (Figs. 16,D and 16,G (a third specimen of quartzitic
sandstone is not shown). This material is a dense fine grained gray quartzitic sandstone. Fig.
16,D is 8.2 cm in length, 3.8 cm maximum width and 2.5 cm thick. The specimen has a
rough pecked surface except for the cutting edge of the bit which has been ground. The
material may be found in outcrops throughout the Ouachita Mountains and in all the stream
beds. It is either from the Stanley Shale or Jackfork Formation.
Fig. 16,G is 12.6 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and approximately 3.5 cm thick.
Tuff Celt (Fig. !6,E). This material is possibly represented by one specimen. The
identification is based on a single observation of the specimen for the duration of a few
minutes. The celt appeared to be made of the Hatton tuff which is a green-gray granular
pyroclasfic rock with inclusions of feldspar. The specimen is approximately 10.5 cm in
length, 5.1 cm in width, and 3.0 cm thick.
Diorite Celts (Figs. 16,C, 16,F, and 16,H). Two of the diorite celts (Figs. 16,C and 16,F)
are made of identical material, a light to medium green stone with small white vermicular
inclusions. The green material is chlorite and the white inclusions are probably plagioclase
feldspar. Fig. 16.C is 8.7 cm in length, 4.0 cm width, and 2.9 cm thick. Fig. 16,F is 6.9 cm
in length, 3.2 cm width, and 2.0 cm thick.
Fig. 16,H is made of a dark greenish black diorite, very similar to one variety of Colbert
Creek diorite. Again, the predominant mineral appears to be chlorite, but it lacks the
vermicular structure. A single oval inclusion of white material (probably plagioclase) is
located on the polished bit. It is 7.3 cm in length, 4.0 cm in width, and 2.2 cm thick.
Claystone-Siltstone Pebble Tools (Figs. 15,S and 15,T). Two artifacts of different
materials are included in this designation. Both specimens are made from small pebbles and
required little alteration for use. The artifacts should probably be classified as pebble-tool
chisels or gouges although the bits are bifacially ground. Fig. 15,T is made of a light brown
material with a dark brown-black core. The outer brown color is probably due to weathering
prior to human alteration. The material is very fine grained, dense, and is probably a
well-indurated siltstone or highly weathered Big Fork Chert. The specimen is 7.7 cm in
length, 1.9 cm maximum width, and 10 mm thick.
Fig. 15,S is a yellow-brown fine grained material that is locally called "river jasper," but
the material is more conformable to a well-indurated claystone. The specimen is 6.8 cm in
length, !.6 cm in width, and 9 mm thick.

28

CULTURAL FEA TURES

Gahagan Bifaces (Figs. ! 3,A, 13,B, and 13,C). Figure 13,C is 32.1 cm in length, 6.3 cm
maximum width, and 1 cm thick. The material is identical to a weathered variety of
Woodford Chert. The biface is a mottled tan and cream color. A recent break at the point of
the blade reveals a light gray core with a patination 1 mm thick. A wear pattern on the
highest points of both faces of the blade was pointed out by Dee Area Story and Harry
Shafer as being identical to wear on a biface from a shaft burial at the George C. Davis site.
This wear polish extends the full length of the blade and may result [Yore sheathing. This
specimen was recovered from the river bed below Feature No. 1.
The bifaces represent a type often referred to as a "Copena blade," but this designation
was changed at the Twelfth Caddo Cont"erence (authorâs notes) to "Gahagan biface." Fig.
13,A is finely flaked with an expanded base and incurvate blade edges. The material is a gray
variety of Woodford Chert. It contains tiny white silica inclusions and is translucent with
increashag thinness. The material has a dul! to slightly waxy luster. The blade is 13.1 cm in
length, and 3.3 cm maximum width at the base. The blade varies from 2.8 to 3.3 cm in
width. The thickness is 4 mm.
Fig. 13,B is also a Gahagan biface, and the artifact has not been examined to determine
the lithic material. Its length is 14.0 cm and the maximum width is 4.3 cm.
Projectile Points. The 40 projectile points from Feature No. 1 represent six arrowpoint
types and one dart point type. There is little doubt that other points were present in the
feature and ultimately lost in the talus and the river. The point types were distributed as

CULTURAL FEA TURES

The distinction between Hayes points and three of the points typed here as Alba (Fig.
14,N-P) is based on the diamond-shaped versus the rounded stem. Fig. 14,N-P should
probably be classified a variety of Alba (Bell, 1958:8) as a possible intermediate between
the Homan and classic Alba types. The Hayes points are easily identified by the
characteristic diamond-shaped stem (Bell, 1958:32, 16), and the Homan type point defined
by Wood (1963: !-6) is unique in the basal shape resembling the Agee point. However, the
incurvate blades and the thin pointed extension at the tips of the Hayes and Homan points
bear close similarities to each other and to the point type here called ,~dba. Fig. 14,N closely
resembles the Homan type illustrated by Perino (1968:34-35), with the exception of the
blade width, which is wider in the Homan type. Hoflâman (1968:30) refers to this type point
in relation to the Alba, and later refers to the type as a wide stemmed Alba (Hoffman
1970:179).
Fig. 14,M is identified here as an Alba, but the specimen may well be termed a Hayes
with a bulbous stem by Bellâs description (1958:32). This point is the only specimen made
of a translucent type of novaculite. The blade has been resharpened and may have been used
for some type of perforator or drill. The tip of the point is broken by lateral pressure.
An interestingphenomena is evident in the difference of workmanship and apparent
technology exhibited in the Scallorn points. (Figs. 15,G-J). In comparison to the other
points from Feature No. 1 they are crudely made. Although the material, red siltstone, does
not readily lend itself to fine flaking, the fact that most of the Hayes points are made of
identical material and are finely flaked suggests a difference in the artisan, or perhaps the
flaking technique.
The single Haskell point (Fig. 15,O) is made of the only type material of the
arrowpoints that could not be obtained locally. This material is a light gray, fine-grained and
even-colored opaque chert. It has not been positively identified, but two significant
observations can be made. The chert is not typical of kinds found in Ouachita Mountains,
but it is reminiscent of several types found in the western flanks of the Ozark Uplift in the
northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. The most similar chert is the Sallisaw. The
fact that the point is also identified as Haskell by Brownâs definition (Perino, 1968:32-33),
may indicate trade from the Spiro area.
The single unidentified point (Fig. 15,O) is a small rectangular stemmed specimen with
two side notches, it is made on a small flake-blade of black Big Fork Chert.
Figure 15,R is the single dart point represented in Feature No. 1. It is a Gary type point
(Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 197) and is made fiâom yellow jasper and is bifacially flaked from a
pebble.
Two Reed type points (Bell: 1958, 76) were represented, but only one is illustrated.
This specimen (Fig. 15,P) is made fiâom a primary flake of a weathered Big Fork Chert
pebble. The outer convex surface retains the characteristic brown waxy bark of the
weathered cortex. A pebble core of identical material (Figs. 27,I and 27,J) was found on the
surface of Feature No. 4.
Lithic Technology and Materials. The lithic technology evidenced in artifact
manufacture from Feature No. 1 is varied and shows a remarkable use of available materials.
The degree of technology varies from the artistic talent reflected in the human effigy pipe to
the minor skills shown in altering a pebble to a practical tool (Fig. 15,T).
The basic technology was chipping, pecking, and grinding, all three of which were
utilized in the manufacture of the celts. A sequence of celt manufacture has been well

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

33

demonstrated and described by Skinner, et al. (1969:91-92). In addition to this basic
technology, the stone work exhibits carving, coring, boring, engraving, and probably some
type of rotational abrasion, as evidenced by the exact dimensions of a matched set of
earspools (Figs. 11,A and 11,B).
The lithic materials include limestone, black siliceous shale, siltstone-claystone, three
varieties of chert, diorite, tuff, quartzitic sandstone, novaculite, and either greenstone or
green siliceous shale. With the possible exception of the diorite, and two types of chert,
most of the materials were available within a relatively short distance (20 miles) of the
Bentsen-Clark site. Fig. 17 shows the closest and most probable sources of the materials, but
other sources may have been known to the Caddo.
Most of the projectile points appear to be made from pebbles obtained from Red River
gravel bars. A few of the points exhibit unifacial flaking and were made from flake-blades.
The remaining arrowpoints were probably made from flake-blades with the primary flake
scar removed. While pebbles of Woodford Chert are occasionally found on Red River bars, it
is a near impossibility to obtain cobbles large enough to produce bifaces the size of those
from Feature No. 1. In bedded outcrops, the Woodford Chert is highly fractured and
generally not conducive for producing large bifaces. Large cobbles such as those found
southeast of McAlester best match the material of the bifaces.
It is also difficult to presently obtain an unfractured piece of green siliceous shale large
enough to make a celt the size of Figure 16,B. In addition to the !ocation of the green
siliceous shale shown on the lithic resources map, the Potato Hills area of the Kiamichi basin
should produce the characteristic green chert and shale varieties of the Big Fork Chert
discussed in this report. The green chert pebbles are quite common in the Kiamichi gravel
bars. The fact that the only outcrops of Woodford Chert occur north of the general vicinity
of the Potato Hills seems to substantiate the probability of this area for Caddoan resource
exploitation. An addition to this hypothesis is the fact that the Caddo guides of Jean
Baptiste Benard Sieur de la Harpe followed a route to the Arkansas River that crossed this
area (Smith, 1958: 382).
The source of the diorite is unknown although the material is similar to the Colbert
Creek diorite. The mineral components appear to be almost identical, but the vermicular
structure in the celt material is different.
Honess (1923:210) described the diorite as,
Â¯..a very dense, tough hard rock of a light greenish gray color, having a medium
to fine grained granitoid texture and massive structure .... In thin section under
the microscope this rock is observed to consist essentially of andesine plagioclase
occurring in multiple twinned, tabular, interlocking crystals with which originally
was a large percentage of ferromagnesium minerals, but the latter are now wholly
destroyed and the cavities filled with a colorless chlorite. The chlorite occurs in
relatively large sized grains...but much of this material is scattered
promiscuously, as small ragged flecks and scales .... The rock contains very little
alkalic feldspar and no quartz and should probably be called, therefore, a
quartz-free diorite.

The limestone could be from two possible sources. One is located about 8 mi south of
the Bentsen-Clark site where the stream channels have cut into the Annona Chalk (Texas
Geologic Atlas, Texarkana Sheet), offering an easily exploited source. The other is located
near the basal portion of Stigler Bluff (Goodland; Limestone) on the south side of Little
River about 1 mi downstream from the Glover Creek-Little River confluence. The fine
grained massive limestone can be found at numerous points a!ong the south side of Little
River from Idabel to Millerton, Oklahoma (Miser, 1954).
The remaining materials may be found at numerous widely separated areas throughout
the Ouachita Mountains, but no other single source area offers as high a percentage of lithic
materials from the site as does the Glover Creek basin. Within a radius of 5 mi from the
MacDonald site on Glover Creek, outcrops of Arkansas Novaculite, Colbert Creek Diorite,
Big Fork Chert, Hatton Tuff, quartzitic sandstone, Goodtand Limestone, and Battiest Chert
Occur.

While these materials may be found separately in many other areas, the Glover Creek
Â¯ basin appears to be the most logical source area for most of the lithics at the Bentsen-Clark
site. The material of a single arrowpoint (Fig. 15,0) has not been positively identified, but
the material appears to be one of the varieties of light gray fine grained cherts from the
Mississippian formations of northeast Oklahoma or northwest Arkansas.
The brown variety of siltstone is very similar to and may be from weathered Big Fork
Chert cobbles. The other siltstone is a red and yellow material with fine but noticeable
grain, a dull luster, and is opaque. The materials are obtainable from Red River gravel bars as
well-indurated siltstone.
The claystone, often erroneously called jasper, is also red and yellow, but it differs from
the siltstone in having a fine, smooth texture and a slight luster. Its source is also from Red
River gravel bars.
The novaculite arrowpoint shown in Fig. 15,C is a dull light gray material of poor
quality, typical of material from the outcrop on Rock Pile Mountain above Beaverâs Bend
on the Mountain Fork River. Fig. 14,M is made of a light blue gray translucent material.
Tiny black inclusions occur throughout the material. It has a waxy luster, which is often
associated with heat treating. However, there has been no discoloration. The material could
conceivably come from outcrops of gravel on the Glover or Cossatot Rivers.
The Big Fork Chert is a dull opaque black and tan material. It differs from the similar
Battiest Chert in that it has no luster, weathers brown and tan, and has no hair-like quartz
veins. The best outcrops occur on the Glover and Mountain Fork Rivers.
The Battiest Chert occurs near the middle of the Stanley Shale formation in a 25 ft zone
of interbedded chert and siliceous shale (Honess, 1923:152). The material is black with a
slight to glossy luster, especially on a fresh surface. It is often cut by small hair-like veins of
white quartz and it weathers with a white, gray, or light tan cortex. Possibly the best
outcrop is !ocated in the upper Glover River.
The Woodford Chert outcrops at five localities along the ridge of the western Winding
Stair Mountains which separates the Canadian and Kiamichi drainage systems. There are no
known outcrops of Woodford Chert in the Little River drainage system. Small cobbles of
the chert are common in the Kiamichi River grovels, and in the Red River below the
Kiamichi confluence. Selectivity in the Red River gravels had to be greater because of the

36

37

decreasing percentage of chert farther downstream. Source material for the bifaces of
Woodford Chert had to be the actual outcrops or a gravel source near the outcrop.
Six varieties of chert have been collected from one outcrop where the Woodford occurs
as large cobbles or boulders that were redeposited in the lower Caney Shale formation. The
two predominate varieties of Woodford Chert described here are:
1. A dense opaque variety, deep brownish-black in color with horizontal banding. It
weathers gray to light brown in color. This chert is found in boulders up to approximately
25 by 30 by 75 cm.
2. The second most comlnon type (Fig. 13,B) at this locality is a horizontally banded
light whitish gray to blue black translucent material. Even in a weathered condition the
banding is evident. The weathering typically results in banded shades of yellow, brown, and
gold.
The Ogallala Chert (Figs. 15,D-F) is probably the most common type chert from north
central Oklahoma near Alva to north central Texas west of Fort Worth. Pleistocene terrace
remnants throughout this area contain the chert pebbles and cobbles, and the drainage
systems cutting across this area, such as the Red River, carry quantities of the material as
gravels. While this type material is inferior to most cherts, it was widely used, probably
because of its accessibility. It is typically various shades of mottled yellow, red, tan, and
gray. Its texture is smoother and finer grained than quartzite, but it is often mistaken for
quartzite. The luster is dull and it often has small vugs (holes) and inclusions of extraneous
materials.
The jasper represented here is a fine grained yellowish material with a smooth texture
and waxy luster. The material can be obtained from Red River gravel bars and Pleistocene
remnants of gravel bars.
Category 3: Copper
Copper was represented as overlay but visible only as a green stain on hair pins and
earspools and as five thin strips. Although the strips were fragments, the uniformity of
dimensions indicate a similar use. Two of the specimens were cemented together with cupric
encrustation, and were placed back to back. One strip was 9.5 cm in length, 7 mm in width,
and 1.5 mm in thickness. It is tapered to a point at one end. The other strip was curved
towards both ends like a bow. It is 9.7 cm in length, 6 mm in width, and 2 mm in thickness.
The longest strip is 13.7 cm in length, 7 mm in width, and 2 mm in thickness. The specimen
is tapered to a point at one end. The maximum width is near the center of the strip and
tapers to a rectangular base 5 mm in width. Fig. 9,A is typical of the strips. The shape of the
specimens are similar to finger-like extensions, but the fact that skull fragments had a
copper stain on them suggests use as head adornments.

Category 4: Ceramics
The ceramics in Feature 1 consist of two forms, vessels and pipes.
Pottery Vessels
This is the most abundant artifact type recovered at Bentsen-Clark. A total of 61 vessels
was found in Feature No. 1 and a larger number were probably once present but were
washed away prior to the initiation of salvage efforts. The vessels are numbered

38

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

consecutively. Numbers 1 through 46 represent unrestomble vessels, sherds or sherd groups,
and number 47 through 61 represent whole or restored vessels. Another 288 sherds from
Feature No. 1 which could not, with any degree of certainty, be included in the various
sherd groups representing broken vessels are described separately and classified as to
previously defined types when possible.
The physical characteristics of vessels represented by sherd groups as well as the
miscellaneous sherds, including color, temper and texture were visually inspected with a
hand glass and can be described in arbitrary terms only.
Recognizable tempering materials are predominately clay (the term here includes
fragments of sherds and/or fired clay products) with minor amounts of grit, bone, kaolin,
sand and, in at least one instance, shell. The impression often received was that anything
handy might be used as tempering material and likely some of the non-plastic material was
accidental inclusions in the raw clay.
All vessels are discugsed in categories of types.

Engraved Pottery

Spiro Engraved
Definition. A complexly decorated engraved type first formally described by Newell and
Krieger (1949 : 199-201 ).
Sample Size. There are 7 complete vessels and sherd groups representing another 17
vessels classified as Spiro Engraved of which 5 are bowls, 1 is a seed jar or neckless bottle,
and the remaining 18 are narrow mouthed bottles. The remainder of the sample consists of
65 sherds most of which probably belong to the vessels listed above but are thought to
represent at least 3 additional bottles.
Tempering. The apparent temper is predominately clay with some grit and usually some
white particles which in some instances are bone, in others, possibly kaolin.
Texture. Usually firm and compact.
Surface Treatment. Smoothed and polished from slightly to highly lustrous finish on
exterior and interior surfaces of bowls and exteriors of bottles. The interiors of bottles are
unsmoothed. Some surfaces are even but most are uneven with tool marks which appear as
either rippling or âÂ°peening.ââ
Color. Red-filming (5) on interior and exterior of bowls and exterior only on bottles.
Others usually darker shades of brown and gray to black. Reddish brown and reddish tan
sherds are present. The cores are dark gray to black.
Thickness. Ranges from 3 to 7 mm.
Bowls. The sample includes sherd groups thought to represent 3 globular or
hemispherical bowls, one restorable hemispherica! bowl, and one boat-shaped bowl.
V-1 (Fig. 21,A). This is a sherd group of a red-filmed globular bowl with a direct
collared rim and two opposed rim peaks. The lip is slightly flattened. The upper body is
cylindrical and the base is rounded. Mean body thickness is 4.5 mm and the rim diameter is
approximately 16 cm. The fine-line engraved decoration on this bowl is similar in motif to

complete vessels V-62 and V-63 from Feature No. 3 except it has sets of concentric circles
with an excised dot as the central element instead of spirals, and the triangles formed above
and below the diagonal bands are filled with very closely spaced parallel lines. This vessel is
very similar to one from the Spiro site (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: P1. 74,E).
V-34. This is a sherd group representing a bowl with a collared outflaring rim that is
thinned on the inside and has two opposed rim spouts. The lip is slightly flattened with
rounded edges. The body is globular or hemispherical and the base is rounded. Mean body
thickness is 4.5 mm. The decorative motif and vessel shape is identical to Vessel V-59 (Fig.
19,G). The vessel is similar in shape and decorative motif to one from Spiro (Brown, 1971:
Fig. 14,J).
V-36. This is a sherd group of a reddish brown globular bowl that may have slipped
surfaces. The rim is collared, outflaring and thinned on the inside with two opposed rim
spouts and a rounded lip. The body is globular and the basal shape is unknown. The
decoration is very similar to Vesse! V-1.
V-59. (Fig. 19,H). This is a hemispherically shaped bowl, of which approximately half of
the vessel was present and restorable. This bowl is 19.5 cm in diameter and 9.3 cm in height.
The lip is flat and the base is rounded. The rim is collared and has two opposed rim spouts.
The apparent temper is predominately clay, the paste is rather crumbly along the broken
edges. The interior and exterior color is a dark gray brown and the core is dark gray. The
surfaces are slightly uneven with tool marks visible and slightly polished with some luster.
The decoration consists of a band of parallel lines encircling the collared rim and dipping
down below the rim spouts. The body is covered with sets of spirals with an excised dot as
the central element.
V-60. (Fig. 19,G). Tliis is an elongated oval or boat-shaped carinated bowl. This bowl is
approximately 17.3 cm in length (one end is missing), 7.5 cm wide and is 5.1 cm in height.
The lip is flat and the base is convex. In thickness, the body walls are 4mm, the base is 7
mm and the lip is 3 ram. The apparent temper is clay with sparse bone particles, and the
paste is firm and compact. The red-fihned interior and exterior surfaces are smoothed and
even have a highly polished finish. The decoration consists of sets of concentric circles with
the smallest circle of each set filled with punctates, divided by bands of parallel diagonal
lines. In size, shape, and decoration this vessel closely resembles one recorded from
Crenshaw (Durham and Kizzia, 1964: Fig. 44, p. 67) except the Crenshaw vessel has sets of
spiral instead of concentric circles.
Narrow Mouthed Bottles. This group includes 18 bottles of which 4 are complete and 14
are represented by sherd groups. The bodies are globular and in all cases where basal forms
are recognizable (8), they are flattened and circular. The necks are either tapering (5),
tapering with slight outward flare near the lip (2), or tapering with a slightly constricted
orifice (1). The shapes of the others are undetermined. The lips are flat (2) or slightly
flattened with rounded edges (2). At least one flattened lip (V-5) has an outward bevel. The
others are unknown. One bottle (V-35) has a raised collar beginning at the base of the neck
Â¯ and extending down onto the body for a distance of 2.5 cm.

40

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

The decoration is engraved with lines ranging in "fineness" from very fine to coarse.
There is usually a band of parallel horizontal fines encircling the upper body (t7 of 18
vessels), beginning at the base of the neck. A similar band may be present just above the
base (6) or absent (4), with the other 8 unknown. On 3 or 7 bottles, with necks complete
enough to determine, there is a band of parallel horizontal lines present on the upper neck
just below the lip. The lowest line of this band is usually wider and heavier than the others.
Decorative motifs on the body include spirals, concentric circles, concentric semicircles,
concentric and/or nested rectangles, concentric arcs, and bands of parallel lines running
vertically or diagonally. The corners where lines come together at right angles and central
cores of design elements may either be filled with punctates, or excised, hatched or
crosshatched.
V-5, 6, 9, 35, 42, 43, 44, 46. This is a group of bottles represented by sherd groups that
have similar decorative motifs. This group, 3 vessels of which are red-filmed, has a decorative
motif consisting of sets of concentric circles or spirals with an excised dot for the central
core. When the sets are spirals, one of the two lines spiraling from the central dot is wider
and heavier than the other. The sets are separated by bands of parallel diagonal lines. Vessels
with similar shape and decoration have been found at the Spiro site (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:
P1. 74,a,c), and the Crenshaw site (Suhm and Jells, 1962: P1. 40,e, identified as Holly
Engraved).
V-20. This is a sherd group of a bottle with a design consisting of four opposed groups
of concentric semi-circles within a circle. The core of this design element resembles a
four-pointed star with the points filled with hatching. The design appears to have been
repeated three times, each divided by bands of parallel diagonal lines. This bottle is similar
to one from the Crenshaw site (Wood, 1962: Fig. 4,f) and another vessel illustrated in the
present report (Vessel V-61 ).
V-22. This sherd group is of a bottle decorated with sets of concentric circles cut across
and divided by a band of parallel diagonal lines. The central dot and corners of design
elements are excised.
V-24. This bottle has designs that haclude nested and/or concentric rectangles alternating
with spirals or concentric circles in two horizontal bands. The hnes between the outer two
rectangles in each element are punctate filled.
V-30. This sherd group (Fig. 20,C) is of a bottle with a decorative motif.consisting of a
band of parallel vertical hnes, breaking down the center, and dividing sets of concentric
circles. Between the circles is a vertica! band filled with parallel horizontal curving lines or
arcs. This bottle has a band of parallel horizontal lines encircling the top of the neck just
below the lip. The lower line of this band is wider and heavier than the others.
V-38. This bottle has a band of parallel diagonal lines and a band of parallel vertical lines
coming together at right angles but the complete design could not be determined.
V-45. The remaining sherd group represents a bottle with a very complex design
consisting of concentric circles or spirals, concentric rectangles and concentric semi-circles
possibly similar to one from the Spiro site (Brown, 197t : Fig. 14,k).
V-47 (Fig. 18, A). The height is 22.1 cm. The body is roughly globular with well
rounded corners and is 11.0 cm in diameter. The neck is 10.8 cm in height and slightly
flared at the r~outh. The base is flat and irregularly square. The body wall is 5 mm thick.
The orifice of the neck is 3.4 cm in diameter. The paste is a fine compact clay with grit
temper. The decoration is rather crudely executed and consists of four engraved sections
separated by two vertically incised lines spaced at an average of 2 cm. The area between the

incised lines is undecorated. The engraved design is complemented with excised centers of
whorls and punctating in the corner areas between the engraving and the incised lines. The
vessel is unpolished and is a tan-buff color with blacked areas on the body.
V-48 (Fig. 18, B). This is a bottle 25 cm in height. The neck is 13 cm in length and
flared at the top. The base is a flat disk 5 mm in thickness. The body wall is also 5 mm
thick. The body is four-!obed in form with a maximum diagonal diameter of 15 cm. The
paste is fine clay with a small amount of shell temper. The surface of the vessel is brown and
polished. Decoration has five concentric circles at the top of body and four at the base. The
body is engraved and excised with red pigment in the engraved and excised portions.
V-51 (Fig. 18, E). This bottle has an undefined disk base 7 mm thick and slightly
convex. The height is 22.3 cm and the globular body is 11.0 cm in diameter. The neck is
10.8 cm in length and flares at tt~e rim. The outside diameter of the rim is 4.9 cm and at its
narrowest point the neck is 4.3 cm in diameter. The wall at the rim is 5 mm thick. The body
is decorated with complicated diagonal lines and the engraved lines filled with red ochre.
The surface is black and polished.
V-61 (Fig. 19, i). This vessel is represented by the base and approximately one-fifth of
the body of a finely engraved bottle. The slightly convex disk base is 5 mm thick and 10.3
cm in diameter. The body wall varies from 5 to 6 mm in thickness. The paste is a fine
compact black clay with grit temper. The form of the body is globular, and the uniformly
gray surface is engraved with four concentric lines above the base at 6 mm intervals. A
four-pointed star inside a series of four concentric circles has a center of two concentric
circles around an excised circle 10 mm in diameter. The four points of the star are also
excised. Red pigment was rubbed into the excised and engraved portions of the vessel.
Jar. V-52 (Fig. 18, F). This vessel is commonly called a "seed jar." It appears to be a
neckless bottle, but the inside of the rim is thinned and finished like the surface of the
vessel. Two suspension holes (bott~ 6 mm diameter) are located in the center of the third
concentric ring below the top. The holes are punched in from the outside while the vessel
was wet. The body wall is 4 mm thick and the convex disk base is 5 mm thick. Height is 8.9
cm and diameter of the body is also 8.9 cm. Color is a slightly mottled dark gray-tan. The
paste is a fine black clay and the surface is polished. Decoration exhibits engraving and
punctating with seven concentric circles at the top and three at the base. The motif is
basically horizontal asymmetrical triangles.

Holly Engraved
Definition. A fine-line engraved type (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: p. 77, P1. 39-40).
Sample Size. Included in this type is a restored wide mouthed bottle (V-53) and a sherd
group representing a red-filmed carinated bowl.
V-4. This is a sherd group of a red-filmed carinated bowl (Fig. 20,A) that has a narrow
almost straight rim and a rounded base. The lip form is unknown. The temper includes grit,
bone, and shell and the paste is firm and compact. The interior and exterior surfaces are
smoothed and uneven with a slightly lustrous finish. The engraved decoration is on the rim
band and includes alternating vertical and diagonal bands of parallel lines. The corners where
lines come together at fight angles are excised. This bowl is similar to one from the
Crenshaw site (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: P1. 40,A).
V-53 (Fig. 19,A). This wide mouthed bottle is 13.7 cm in height including the neck of

44

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

7.4 cm in length. The mouth is 9.5 cm in diameter and the rim wall is slightly over 2 mm
thick. The body wall is 4 mm thick and the disk base is 4 mm thick. The paste is a fine
textured clay. The neck decoration is composed of very fine engraved lines complemented
with excising and the decoration rubbed with red ochre. The color of the plain body is a
dark reddish brown, and the neck is a lighter shade of reddish brown. The femur of a
squirrel (Sciurus carolit~ensis) was found encrusted between 2 of the larger sherds.
Hickory Engraved

Definition. This type was first formally described by Newell and Krieger (1949: 90-91,
Figs. 33, 44) and later modified by Suhm and Jelks (1962: 71, P1. 36).
Sample Size. There are 2 narrow mouth bottles included in this type, both represented
by sherd groups.
V-40. This bottle has a tapered neck and globular body. The lip and basal form is
unknown. Mean thickness of body sherds is 3.5 mm. The temper is clay-grit and the paste is
firm and compact. The exterior color is predominately black but ranges to brown and
reddish brown. The interior is gray to reddish brown and the core is dark gray. The exterior
has a smooth slightly uneven (tool marked) surface that is burnished to a high degree of
luster. The interior surface is slightly smoothed. The decoration consists of a band of four
parallel engraved lines encircling the upper body horizontally beginning at tile base of the
neck.
V-41. In form this bottle is the same as V-40. The mean thickness of body sherds is 5
mm. Apparent temper includes clay, grit and bone and the paste is firm and very compact.
The exterior color is brown to reddish brown and the interior as well as core color is tan.
The exterior surface is smooth, even and burnished with a slight luster. The interior surface
is unsmoothed. This bottle has a band of six parallel lines encircling the upper body
horizontally just below the neck. The lower line is wider and heavier than the upper five.
Undesignated Engraved
Definition. In this category, we have placed a composite group of vessels with engraved
decoration not assignable to previously defined types. This group includes a wide variety of
vessel shapes and decorative motifs.
Sample Size. Five vessels are represented by sherd gaoups; two bottles and a bowl are
complete.
V-3o Two large sherds represent portions of the rim and upper body of a fine-line
engraved jar. It is primarily clay tempered with some bone included. The paste is firm and
compact. The interior and exterior color is mottled dark brown to tan from differential
firing and the core is dark gray. The surfaces are smoothed, slightly uneven and will reflect
some light. This jar has a rather tall everted rim and globular body. There is a smooth curve
as opposed to an angle at the rim/body junction. The lip is direct rounded and 5 to 5.5 mm
in thickness. Body sherd thickness ranges from 6.5 to 9 mm. The decoration includes a
broad band of parallel lines encircling the rim horizontally and vertical bands of parallel
lines alternating with vertically opposed bands with curvilinear designs which include sets
nested arcs on the body. The smallest arc in each set is filled with hatching. The decorative
motif is not unlike that found on some Spiro Engraved vessels but the lines are wider

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

45

spaced, and this jar form has not been included in the Spiro type definition (Suhrn and
Jelks, 1962: 147).
V-7. This is a partially restored vesse! in which the flat circular base and much of the
body are present. The extreme upper body and neck or rim portions are missing. The even
curvature of the body indicates a slightly constricted orifice possibly of the bottle form. The
smoothed and slightly lustrous interior surface finish, seldom found in the narrow mouthed
bottle form, as well as the presence of green pigment rubbed on the interior suggests the
wide mouthed bottle form. The body thickness is 5 to 6 mm and the base thickness is 7 to 8
mm. The temper is granular clay, the paste is coarse textured, ~nd surface color is reddish
brown on the exterior and slightly darker greyish brown on the interior. The core color is
dark gray. Both interior and exterior surfaces are smoothed and bumpy with a slight luster.
The decoration includes sets of concentric circles with two parallel lines encircling the body
horizontally about even with the apex of the circles and dipping down below each set. Thisâ
scroll derived motif is similar to that sometimes found on Crockett Curvilinear Incised
bowls, but in this case the design is engraved.
V-17. This is a partially restored narrow mouth bottle with a fine-line engraved
decoration. This bottle has a flattened circular base, a globular body and a tapered neck.
The lip form is unknown. The mean body thickness is 4.5 mm and the base thickness is 5 to
6 mm. The temper includes clay, grit and white particles which may be bone and the paste is
firm and compact. The interior, exterior and core are dark grey to black in color. The
exterior surface is smoothed, even and burnished to a high luster. The decoration consists of
a complex arrangement of closely spaced pgrallel lines in geometric and curvilinear designs.
This bottle is very similar to the complete bottle shown in Figure 18,C.
V-18. This vessel is represented by seven rim and upper body sherds of a simple globular
bow! (Fig. 20,B). The lip is slightly thinned and flattened. The base shape is unknown but is
usually rounded on simple bowls. The lip and body thickness is 3.5 mm and 4.5 to 6 ram,
respectively. The tempering material includes fine clay, grit and bone. The paste is firm and
compact. The interior, exterior and core color is dark brownish gray. The surface finish is
smooth, slightly uneven (tool marked) and burnished to a high luster. The decoration
consists of a band of four parallel lines encircling the rim area horizontally. The upper three
lines appear to be engraved (possibly when the paste was dry but before firing) but the
lower line is incised and overhanging similar to those found on Coles Creek Incised vessels.
V-37. This is a sherd group (15 body and basal sherds) representing an engraved vessel of
unknown form. The base is flat and circular and body walls rise ahnost vertically from the
base suggesting a jar or barrel shape form. The base thickness is 9 to 10 mm and the body
walls are 5 to 8 mm. The temper includes a good amount of bone as well as clay and grit.
The paste is coarse and crumbly. The exterior color is dark brown and the interior is a light
red. Both surfaces are smoothed and uneven and the exterior is imperfectly burnished with a
slight luster in some areas. The engraved decoration has curvilinear elements and covers the
entire body.
V-49 (Fig. 18,C). This complete narrow mouthed bottle has a long tapered neck with a
slightly flattened lip. The body is spherical with a flat, circular disc base. It is 22.8 cm in
height and has a maximum diameter of 12.2 cm. The body wall is 6 mm thick. The apparent
temper is clay, the paste is firm and compact. The surfaces are uneven with horizontal ripple
marks and polished to a high luster. The exterior surface color is dark brown to gray, the
interior and core color is dark gray. Some elements of the decoration are similar to Spiro

46

CULTURAL FEA TURES

Engraved and this vessel could possibly be considered as a variety of that type. Red pigment
is present in the lines.
V-50 (Fig. 18,D). This bottle is very similar to the one described above (V-49) but the
body is more elongated. The top edge of the tapered neck has been broken and resmoothed.
The present height is 23.5 cm. The rim of the vessel is 4.3 cm in diameter and the orifice is
3.1 cm. The disc base is slightly convex and is 12 mm thick. The apparent temper is clay and
the paste is firm and compact. The exterior color is a yellowish brown, the interior is dark
gray. The exterior surface is slightly uneven due to polished over temper particles. The
design layout on this vessel is similar to V-49 except the lines are finer with more lines per
unit and where small elements are hatched or scratched out on V-49 they are filled with
punctates on V-50. There is red pigment in the lines.
V-57 (Fig. 19,E). This is a carinated bowl with a very narrow inward slanting rim and a
flattened circular base. The height is 7 cm and the diameter at the rim is 17.5 cm. The body
wall and the base are 6 mm thick. The apparent temper is predominately clay and the
surface and core are dark gray. The surfaces are smoothed and slightly uneven with very
slight luster. The engraved decoration is on the narrow rim band and consists of alternating
and opposed half-circles divided by bands of widely spaced diagonal curving lines which
conform to and repeat the outline of the half-circles. The half-circles are scratched out with
a pointed tool similar to excising. This design layout is similar to Holly Engraved, but the
lines are heavier and wider spaced with less lines per unit. A vessel with similar decoration
from Crenshaw (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: P1. 40,B) was classified as Holly Engraved but
vessels with narrow inward slanting rims are unknown in the Holly type.
Miscellaneous Engraved Sherds
In addition to the sherd groups from Feature No. 1, representing vessels with engraved
decoration, there are 60 unassignable sherds with some type of engraved decoration. The
majority of these are small body sherds but some are basal sherds with a portion of the body
decoration and bottle neck sherds, two of which are almost complete. The bottle necks all
appear to be tapered but three have a slight outward flare near the lip. Sherds of four bottle
necks that have a band of parallel horizontal lines just below the lip are present; others are
from the lower neck area with portions of the body decoration included. Some of these
sherds probably belong to the above listed sherd groups, others are possibly remaining
portions of Hickory, Holly and Spiro Engraved vessels canied away by the river.
Incised Pottery
Crockett Curvilinear Incised

Definition. A wide spread type featuring curvilinear, scroll derived elements with a
contrasting background of incised lines or punctates or both. The original description is that
of Newell and Krieger (1949: 98-101).
Sample Size. The sample includes 3 sherd groups representing vessels V-11, V-25, and
V-32.
Temper. Predominately clay with both granular and angular particles present with minor
amounts of grit and in one case a minor amount of sand.
Texture. Firm and compact, except in one case which is crumbly.
Color. Medium to dark shades of brown on both interior and exterior. The cores are
dark gray.

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

47

Surface Finish. Both interior and exterior surfaces are imperfectly burnished to
burnished with some degree of luster and are slightly uneven due to wipe marks or in some
cases "peen" like marks.
Vessel Shape. Of the 3 bowls represented by sherd groups from Feature No. 1, only one
(V-11) is complete enough to determine vessel shape. It has a globular body and slightly
everted rim. The lip is slightly flattened with rounded edges and is 3.5 mm in thickness. The
thickness of the body wall is 4 to 5 ram. The other 2 sherd groups representing Crockett
bowls are too incomplete for accurate shape description. The mean thickness of body sherds
present for both bowls is 5.5 mm.
Decoration. The decoration covers the rim or rim area and that part of the body above
the shoulder on carinated bowls and most all of the body of other bowl shapes. There is a
band of parallel lines encircling the rim, or rim area horizontally and usually a similar band
or single line below the body decoration.
Of the sherd groups, one (V- 11 ) has a scroll-like design consisting of four sets of spirals,
with a small circle for the central element, divided by bands of parallel diagonal lines. The
border zones created by the diagonals are filled with parallel lines which conform to and
repeat the outline of the circular spiral elements. Vessels with very similar designs were
found at the Spiro site (Brown, 1971: Figs. 10,g, j, and 1). The two remaining sherd groups
(V-25 and V-32) are very incomplete but the decorative motif of both appears to have a
repetitive scroll design with circular centers filled with punctates and separated by bands o{
parallel diagonal lines. The border zones created by the diagonal lines are punctate filled. On
Vessel V-32 the decoration was applied when the paste was dry or leather hard. On V-25 the
lines and punctates were filled with red pigment.
Kiam Incised
Definition. A type with horizontally incised lines on the rims, and bodies that are plain,
vertically incised or covered with punctation (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: 89).
Sample Size. One sherd group representing a jar (V-10).
Description. The sherd group (10 rim sherds) represents a jar (V-10) with a narrow
slightly everted rim and an orifice diameter of approximately 14 cm. The.lip is flat and 4
mm in thickness and thickness at the lower edge of the rim is 5 mm. The body and base
sherds are missing. Tempering materials include clay, grit and possibly bone and the paste is
coarse textured and crumbly. The exterior and core color is reddish brown, the interior is
dark gray. The exterior surface of the rim was unsmoothed aRer the decoration was applied
and the interior is smoothed but bumpy due to coarse particles of the tempering material
protruding through the surface. The decoration covers the rim and consists of very crude,
broken, and closely spaced horizontal incised lines that tend to run together and sometimes
cross each other. The rim decoration of this vessel is similar to that of the complete vessel
(V-66) from Feature No. 3.

East Incised
One partically restored vessel (V-58, Fig. 19,F) and one sherd group (V-12, Fig. 21,B),
are included in the type East Incised. The sherd group represents a low-waisted carinated

48

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

bowl with two opposed rim peaks, straight body walls, and a rounded base. There is a
definite angle at the rim-body junction. The lip is flattened and is 3.5 mm in thickness. The
body thickness is 4 to 7 mm and the approximate diameter at the orifice is 18 cm. The
tempering material includes clay, grit, and white particles which may be either bone or
kaolin. The paste is.firm and compact. The surface color is grayish brown with some tan
areas from differential firing and the core is dark gray. Both surfaces are smoothed and
uneven with horizontal ripple marking and burnished with a slight luster. The decoration is a
single overhanging line that dips down below the rim peaks and gives the rim area a collared
appearance.

V-58. This is an East Incised (in this case engraved) low waisted carinated bowl (Fig. 19,
F) with a diameter, at the orifice, of 9.4 cm, and is 4.8 cm in height. The lip is slightly
flattened with rounded edges and the base is convex. In thickness, the body walls are 5 mm
and the base is 6 to 7 ram. This vessel has two opposed (one missing) rim tabs or peaks 4 cm
in length, that rise upward and slant outward from the rim. The interior surface of these
tabs are flat as opposed to the "cupped" surfaces of rim spouts. The apparent temper is clay
and the texture of the paste is coarse. The color of both the interior and exterior surfaces
are buff red to dark brown from differential firing, the core is reddish gray. The surfaces are
bumpy and uneven due to large particles of the clay temper and tool marks which have the
appearance of "peening." The surfaces are imperfectly polished with a very slight luster in
some area. The decoration consists of three engraved lines running parallel to the rim and
dipping down below the rim tabs. The lower of the three lines is wider and heavier.
Undesignated Incised
Definition. This category includes all incised vessels complete or in sherd groups that are
not assigned to previously defined types.
Sample Size. There is one complete vessel (V-56; Fig 19,D) and three sherd groups
representing a jar (V-15) and 2 bowls (V-13 and V-23).
Description. The jar (V-15), described from a large rim sherd, has a short everted rim
with a flat lip that is 5 mm in thickness and has a thickness of 6 to 6.5 mm at the rim/body
junction. The temper is predominately clay with a minor amount of grit and the surfaces are
smoothed but not polished. The interior and exterior color is reddish brown to buff and the
core is gray. The rim decoration consists of crossed diagonal incised lines very similar to that
of the complete jar (V-67, Fig. 22,F) from Feature No. 3.
V-13. This sherd group represents a carinated bowl with a rounded base and a definite
angle at the rim!body junction. The thickness of body sherds range from 4.5 to 6 mm. The
temper is primarily clay and the paste is fine textured and compact. The interior and
exterior surface color is light brown with reddish tan to dark gray areas due to differential
firing. The surface finish is smooth, uneven and burnished with a slight luster. The
decoration is not clear but a small portion of a horizontal incised line is present.
V-23. This vessel is defined from a single rim sherd that appears to be from a globular
bowl with a flattened, slightly thinned lip. The tempering materials include clay, grit and
small white particles which may be bone, and the paste is fine textured and compact. The
color is pale grayish tan on both the interior and exterior surfaces and the core is gray. Both
surfaces are evenly smoothed and have a burnished lustrous finish. The decoration on the
rim is a band of parallel horizontal lines that was incised with a sharp pointed tool and

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

49

smoothed over after the decoration was applied. In both vessel shape and decorative
technique this bowl is similar to the type East incised; however, there is a possibility that
the missing body portion had some type of decoration and for that reason is unassigned
herein.
V-56 (Fig. 19,D). This unusual vessel is a dark gray in color. The bowl height from base
to rim is 7.3 cm, but the two loop handles extend 7 mm above the rim and 3.5 cm out from
the body. The handles are 2.3 cm in width and 10 mm in thickness. The rim is everted. The
undefined convex base is 9 mm thick and the body is 7 mm thick. The paste is black and
coarse textured with clay-grit temper. The body handles and rim are deeply incised with
close spaced lines. The incised lines on the body are vertical, those on the handles are
diagonal, and those around the rim are horizontal.
Pinched Pottery

Undesignated Pinched
Description. This is a handled jar with a pinched decoration. This jar (V-27 ;Fig.21,C) has
an everted rim, a globular body; the basal form is unknown. The lip is slightly flattened but
has rounded edges. The rim thickness is 4 mm and thickness of the sherds are 3.5 to 6 mm.
Surmounting the one handle present is a broken appliqued "adomo" which possibly reflects
stylistic influence from the Mississippi valley. The temper is primarily clay and is
visible on the surfaces. The past is coarse textured and firm. The exterior color is dark
reddish brown, the interior is a lighter shade of reddish brown and the core is dark gray. The
surfaces are imperfectly smoothed with wipe marks across large particles of the clay
tempering material producing a bumpy brushed effect.
The decoration on the body includes parallel rows of small nodes pinched up from the
surface that arches downward from the rim!body junction in what appears to be a
curvilinear motif. The portion of the rim present is undecorated.
Plain Pottery
Sanders Plain
Definition. This is a plain pottery type restricted to slipped ware only. This type was
originally described by Krieger (1946: 185-90) to include both slipped and unslipped clay
(including pulverized sherd) tempered plain wares, but later redefined by Brown
(1971:164-69) to include slipped ware only.
Sample Size. One complete vessel (V-54) and sherd groups representing 3 narrow mouth
bottles (one partially restored, V-2). Four additional body sherds all thought to be from a
minimum of 3 other vessels.
Description. The temper is primarily clay (granular and angular particles), but grit, bone
and!or kaolin is present in minor quantities. The exteriors of bottles and the interiors as well
as exteriors of bowls are slipped, except in the case of one sherd (possibly from a bowl)
where the dark brown interior is highly burnished and unslipped. The slip color ranges from
an even dark red to pale red with tan areas fiâom differential firing. The interiors and cores
of bottles are all darker shades of gray and are unsmoothed. The exteriors of the three

50

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

bottles are smoothed and imperfectly polished with slightly lustrous areas. Three of the
sherds are smoothed with a slight luster on both the exterior and interior surfaces. The
remaining sherd is smoothed but not polished.
Vessel Shape. The three sherd groups (V-2, V-8 and V-28) represent narrow mouth
bottles. The one neck complete enough to describe is tapered, with a rounded lip that has
been thinned on the inside. Two of the bottles have flattened circular bases that are slightly
convex. The base shape of the remaining bottle is unknown. All three have globular bodies
with a thickness range from 4 to 7 ram. Basal thickness is the same as the bodies or slightly
thicker in the center. The slipped and/or burnished interiors of the four sherds suggest they
are from bowls or wide mouth vessels but none are large enough to determine vessel shape.
V-54 Miniature Bottle (Fig. 19,B). This red slipped vessel is 12.8 cm in height. The disk
base is 6 mm thick and 5 cm in diameter. The neck is tapered toward the mouth.
Undesignated Plain
Definition. A group of plain, unslipped and undecorated vessels, in a variety of vessel
shapes, which share some attributes with the types Williams, Leflore, Paris and Smithport
Plain. Some of these sherd groups could easily be undecorated portions of vessels that had
some type of decoration on the upper body and/or rim areas.
Sample Size. There are 11 vessels included in this group, 2 of which are whole vessels,
and 9 are sherd groups or partially restored vessels. There are 5 narrow mouth bottles, 3
carinated bowls, one loop handle jar, and 2 vessels with undetermined form. The remainder
of the sample includes 163 additional sherds which could not be assigned to a specific vessel
or sherd group.
Description. There are three sherd groups representing carinated bowls of which only
one (V-19) is definitely undecorated. The other two sherd groups (V-14 and V139) represent
lower portions of carinated bowls which could have had some types of decoration on the
missing rim area.
V-14. This sherd group represents a large carinated bowl with the rim missing. Base
sherds are not present but the straight or slightly recurved body walls suggest a flat base.
There is a definite angle at the rim/body junction and the body walls are 7.5 to 9 mm in
thickness. The tempering material is clay and the paste is coarse in texture. The interior and
exterior surfaces are smoothed, slightly uneven with a "peened" look and burnished to a
slightly lustrous finish. The color is brown to reddish tan with black fire clouding on both
the interior and exterio) surfaces. The core is dark gray. The missing rim of this vessel could
easily have had some type of decoration such as that of the complete bowl (V-57).
V-19. This sherd group represents a definitely undecorated carinated bowl with a narrow
vertical rim band and a lip that is slightly flattened but rounded on the edges. There is a
definite angle at the rim!body junction and the basal form is unknown. The tempering
material includes clay and bone~ the paste is firm and compact. The interior and exterior
surfaces are dark brownish gray to black in color and the core is dark gray. The surfaces are
smoothed, slightly uneven and have a slightly lustrous finish. In paste, surface finish, and
shape, this vessel is similar to the complete Paris Plain bowl (V-73,Fig. 24,B) from Feature
No. 3.
V-39. This group of sherds represents a shallow carinated bowl with a definite angle at
the rim/body junction. The thickness of body sherds is 3.5 to 6 mm. The tempering material

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

51

is clay with some grit and the paste is firm and compact. The interior and exterior co!or is
dark gray to black and the core is dark gray. The surfaces are smoothed with horizontal
ripple marks and have a burnished, slightly lustrous finish. The rim area of this vessel is
missing and possibly had some type of decoration.
Narrow Mouth Bottles. Three plain unslipped narrow mouthed bottles are represented in
the sherd groups from Feature No. 1, of which two (V-21 and V-29) are definitely
undecorated. The third vessel (V-33) is represented by lower body sherds only and is
included with the narrow mouth bottle forms because of the unsmoothed interior surface
and globular shape. These sherds could easily be undecorated portions of an otherwise
decorated bottle such as Hickory Engraved.
V-21. This is a sherd group representing a narrow mouth bottle with a tapered neck and
a globular body. The base is flat and circular and the lip form is unknown. Mean body
thickness is 5 mm. The temper material includes clay, grit and bone and the paste is firm
and compact. The exterior color is a dark chocolate brown and the core and interior surface
is dark gray. The exterior surface is smoothed, slightly uneven, with horizontal ripple marks
and a burnished, slightly lustrous finish. The interior is unsmoothed.
V-29. This sherd group includes neck and body sherds of a narrow mouth bottle with a
tapered neck, a globular body and a flattened circular base. Mean body thickness of sherds
present is 4.5 mm. The tempering material includes clay, grit and numerous large bone
particles. The paste is firm and compact. The exterior color is dark brown to black and the
interior and core is dark gray. The exterior surface is smoothed, even and has a slightly
lustrous finish, the interior is unsmoothed.
V-33. Two sherds of a smal! bottle with a globular body. The neck and base shapes are
unknown. Mean thickness of the two sherds is 4.5 mm. The temper is clay and the paste is
firm and compact. The exterior color is tan to dark gray from differential firing, the interior
and core are dark gray. The exterior surface is smoothed even and burnished with some
luster.
V-55 Miniature Bottle (Fig. 19,C). This miniature plain bottle is 11.5 cm in height and
the body is 7.0 cm in diameter. The flat disk base is 5 mm thick. The length of the neck is
6.2 cm and 3.5 cm outside diameter at the rim. The neck is slightly flared toward the top.
The mouth of the vessel has an opening of 2.6 cm and the rim is 5 mm thick. The vessel is a
light brown color and the plain surface is poorly smoothed. An unusual feature of the vessel
is the excessive weight for its size. The undetermined thickness of the body wall may
account for some of the weight.
Loop Handle Jar. One sherd group (V-26) represents a plain loop handle jar with an
everted rim and a globular body. The base and lip form is unknown. The thickness of body
sherds is 5 to 6.5 mm. The tempering material includes clay, grit and sparse white particles
which may be bone and the paste is coarse textured. The interior and exterior color is
reddish brown and the core is gray. The surface is smoothed, uneven, with wipe marks
visible, and a slightly lustrous finish on both the interior and exterior. In color and paste this
vessel is similar to Williams Plain (Brown, 1971: 42-48) but in that type, body walls are
usually thicker and loop handles are not known.
Plain Vessels with Unknown Form. There are two sherd groups (V-16 and V-31)
representing partially restored base and lower body sections of vessels possibly of the wide
mouth bottle or jar form. In each case the vessels may have had some type of decoration on

52

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

the upper body or rim area.
V- 16. Partially restored lower body and base of a vessel (possibly a wide mouth bottle or
barrel shape jar) with a small flat circular base and a globular body. The neck or rim form is
unknown. The thickness of body sherds is 4.5 to 6.5 mm and the basal thickness is 7.5 to 8
mm. The apparent temper is clay and the paste is coarse and firm. The interior and exterior
surfaces are light red to buff in color with black fire clouding; the core is dark gray. The
surfaces are smoothed and uneven with vertical ripple marks and are burnished with a slight
luster on both the interior and exterior.
V-31. This sherd group (four body and base sherds) represents a small vessel of unknown
form. It has a small circular base and globular or barrel shaped body. Mean thickness of the
body sherds is 6 mm and the base is 7 mm. The tempering material includes clay, grit and
tiny white particles which may be bone. The exterior color is dark brown, the interior is
buff red and the core is dark gray. The exterior surface is smoothed, uneven and is
burnished with a slight luster. The interior is irregularly smoothed with tool marks.
Sherds. The remainder of the plain pottery sample includes 163 sherds. It is obvious that
many represent undecorated portions of otherwise decorated vessels. There are 12 rim
sherds of which 9 are from narrow mouth bottles with tapered necks and 3 are from vessels
with an open orifice (bowls, jars, etc.)
Of the bottle rims the lips are flat (1) or flattened with rounded edges (5) or rounded
(3). The 3 rims from vessels with open orifice are rounded (2) or flat (1). The remainder of
the sample represent plain body sherds that are identical, in most instances, to the decorated
types found in Features No. 1 and 3.
Ceramic Pipes
A total of eight ceramic pipes was recovered from Feature No. 1, and all eight pipes
represent a single type. Only 4 (Fig. 12,A-D) of the Graves-Chapel variety of Red River
pipes (Hofflnan, 1967:9) are shown. The pipes are all reddish brown in color. Fig. 12,B has
a total stem length of 23.2 cm and 9 mm in diameter. The flared bowl is 2.8 cm in diameter
at the rim, and the bowl is 2.2 cm in height. Fig. 12,A is 29.4 cm in length, and the
extension of the stem is 2.1 cm in length and 9 mm in diameter. The stem perforation is 4
ram. The bowl is 2.3 cm in height and 2.6 cm in diameter. Both pipes have been used and
charred residue remains in the bowls. Specific dimensions for Figs. 12,C,D, are unknown.
Category 5: Cane
A small section of twilled-split cane matting adhered to the surface of an earspool (Fig.
1 1,B). it was preserveâd by the copper salts from the earspool overlay. The strips of cane are
about 5 mm in width. This specimen constitutes the only remains of artifact made from
vegetal material.
Interpretation of Feature No. 1
This feature represents a specially prepared shaft grave for multiple use. The physical
preparations consisted of excavation with shell hoes, importation or manufacture of the
pink sand to cover the floor, and covering the floor with twilled cane matting.
The primary use was Probably intended for a retinue burial, and unlike the normal

elaborate burials of Caddoan cultures (Hoffinan, 1970: 160) this mass interment was not
associated with a mound structure. It was, however, associated with Southern Cult
ceremoniatism as evidenced by the forked-eye motif on the effigy pipe, the stylized swastika
on earspools, snake effigy hair pins, and copper covered earspools (Williams, 1968: 71).
The primary burials were supine with the heads to the south and possibly some to the
north. After the primary placements, the grave remained open long enough to allow water
to stand in the pit. The soil below the floor exhibited water marks. Perino (personal
communication) believes the pit remained open for a rather extensive period because of the
variety of ceramic types, but the fiâiability of the soil type and the fact that sloughing would
probably occur with the fi~t substantial rainfall seem to preclude this hypothesis. There was
no physical evidence that the tomb had been covered with a roof, although such a structural
feature might have been present and prevented sloughing for a greater length of time than
under natural conditions. Also, the diversity of ceramics appears to be a result of the late
date in the Gibson Aspect rather than a prolonged used over a wide time span. During
excavation, the floor of the pit had a slight odor of decay.
The saturated walls of the pit collapsed, covering the primary burials under a wedge
shaped platform around the periphery of the pit. After this, bundle burials were placed in
the center of the grave and individual burials were placed ou the peripheral platform.
It is not known whether the vessels in the grave were broken ceremonially or as a result
of saturation and subsequent crushing from the collapsed walls. The fact remains that the
lowermost ceramics were all broken and cemented with a calcareous accretion, while those
at higher elevations (on the platform) were either complete or broken without being
crushed.
The amount and types of associated perishable goods are also unknown, but based on
the diversity and types of other materials, there must have been a great amount. After the
final interments, grave offerings (ochre and teeth) presumably were thrown in the pit during
backfilling operations.
Feature No. 2
Two adult femurs were protruding from a talus slope 250 ft east of Feature No. 1.
Associated with the two femurs were sherds of an Avery engraved bottle (Fig. 27,A).
The original location, depth, and size of the feature could not be determined. In all
probability, the original location was near the surface, and it definitely was not in geologic
context with Feature No. 1.
The vessel has an undefined disc base 5 mm thick and 8.5 cm in diameter. The body wall
is 4 mm above the base but thickens to 5 mm in the area where the body wall slants inward.
The greatest diameter of the vessel is 15.4 cm at a point 5 cm above the base. The neck
flares slightly toward the mouth, which has been broken off. The neck diameter varies Dom
4.2 cm at the base to 4.5 cm at the rim with an orifice of 3.5 cm diameter. The neck wall is
5 mm thick.
The decoration has two concentric circles on the body below the neck, and engraved
whorls on the body. The engraved whorls are too indistinct to trace. A four point star with
an inner circle is visible under the lowest concentric circle.
The body form is squat and the past is a fine compact clay with shell temper. Small
holes occur where the shell has leached out. The surface is a dark gray-brown color and
appears to have been polished.

Feature No. 3

This feature was another shaft burial exposed in the undercut bank in June of 1970. The
feature was approximately 12 ft deep, but the diameter is unknown. The grav( was about
10 ft southeast of Feature No. 1, and like Feature No. 1, the heads of some individuals
were to the south-southeast, and some were bundled in superimposed positions. The vessels
in the lower portions of the grave were broken like those in Feature No. 1, and the upper
portion of the grave contained unbroken vessels. Quintus Herron believes this feature
contained as mâany individuals as Feature No. 1. The disturbed condition of the burials made
determination of artifact association impossible. Several of the vessels including V-65 appear
to have been placed in an upright position a couple of feet above the burials and in the
south wall of the pit. Several of the skulls were artifically deformed (Fig. 25,B) and green
stain across the back of one skull (Fig. 25,A) indicates the presence of some type of copper
head ornament.
Ceramics were the only type of artifact associated with the burials, and while it is
possible that other artifacts were washed away by the river, it is not too likely. The
singularity of artifactual material probably indicates a specialized burial.
In general, the pottery vessels are in better condition than those in Feature No. 1. Like
Feature No. 1, there was no evidence of a mound associated with the burial.

V-62 Spiro Engraved Bowl (Fig. 22,A). The bowl is 7.4 cm in height and 12.2 cm in
diameter. The peaks extend 10 mm above the normal rim. The undefined disk base is 8 mm
thick and the rim wall is 4 mm thick. The vessel has a light brown, engraved surface and is
smoothed but unpolished.
V-63 Spiro Engraved Bowl (Fig. 22,B). This carinated bowl is 8.2 cm in height and 14.8
cm in diameter. The undefined base is 4 mm thick and the wall thickness at the rim is 2.5
mm. The spouts extend 8 mm above the rim. The engraved surface has a smooth even
textured red film.
V-64 Hickory Engraved Bottle (Fig. 22,C). This vessel is 15.0 cm in height. The disk
base is 7.8 cm in diameter and 5 mm thick. The mouth of the vessel is 3.1 cm and the rim
thickness is 4 mm. The body of the bottle is 11.0 cm in diameter. The polished surface is
black with orange splotches.â The upper part of the body is decorated with four concentric
engraved lines.
V-65 Smithport Plain Bottle (Fig. 22,D). The vessel is 45.3 cm in height, and the body is
30.2 cm in diameter. The disk base is 14.5 cm in diameter and 10 mm thick. The neck
tapers from a diameter of 10.7 cm at the body joint to 5 cm at the mouth. The rim of the
mouth is 4.5 cm (inside diameter), and the wall thickness is 2.5 mm. The surface is
smoothed but not polished. Due to firing, the color is a mottled tan, gray, black and brown.
There is no decoration.
V-66 Kiam Incised (Fig. 22,E). The flat base on the vessel is a square 7 by 7 cm and 6
mm in thickness. The height is !2.3 cm, and the body wall is 5 mm thick. The paste
contains gray shale and bone temper, and the core is black in color. The vessel has a light red
slip with large black burned areas. The everted rim is decorated with four parallel incised
lines below which is a single row of "finger nail punctates" open at the bottom. The
punctates appear to be made with a half-round section of cane or some similar object.
V-67 Undesignated Incised (Fig. 22,F). The wide mouthed jar has a square base 7.7 by
7.8 cm and 8 mm thick. The height is 13.9 cm and the diameter at the rim is 13.2 cm. The
paste is grit and shale tempered with soft white inclusions that appear to be similar to kaolin
(possibly shell). The core is black. Thickness of its wall is 5 mm. It has a reddish-brown slip
inside and out. The inside is smoothed and the outside has a slight polish. The rim is everted
and has a cross-hatched incised design under the lip. Black spots from overfiring splotch the
surface. Except for the decoration, this vessel is almost identical to V-66, and was probably
made by the same individua!.
V-68 Undesignated Engraved (Fig. 23,A). The disk base is slightly convex and 10 cm in
diameter with a thickness of 5 mm. The wall thickness at the rim is 6 mm. The overall
height is 17.4 cm, with the body height of 9.1 cm and the neck 8.3 cm. The mouth is 9.7
cm (outside diameter). The paste is black and clay-grit tempered. The surface is smoothed
but not polished, and is a medium gray in color. The body is decorated with a series of four
engraved whorls separated by three vertical lines. The wide mouthed bottle has 11 incised
lines with an average spacing of 7 mm around the neck of the vessel and three engraved lines
around the lower body wall.

CULTURAL FEA TURES

V-69 Undesignated Engraved (Fig. 23,B). This is a shallow carinated bowl of 4.2 cm in
height and 13.2 cm in diameter at the rim. The engraved rim is 3 mm thick and the convex
base i~ 6 mm thick and slightly flattened. The apparent temper is clay. The interior,
exterior, and core color is very dark grayish brown. The surface is slightly uneven and is
polished to a slight luster. The vessel shape and simple design without the parallel border
lines above or below the decorated rim is similar to Sanders Engraved, but the scroll-like
curvilinear central elements differ from that type, and the vessel is not slipped. Both slipped
and unslipped wares were included in the Sanders Engraved type by Suhm and Jelks (1962:
137), but only slipped wares were included by Brown (1971: 169-178). This vessel is left
undesignated because of the slight variation from Sanders decoration and the tact that it is
not slipped.
V-70 Crockett Curvilinear (Fig. 23,C). This large carinated bowl is 15 cm in height. It is
square in shape but has rounded corners. The base is undefined. The slightly flared rim is 6
mm thick and 30 by 30 cm in diameter. The paste is a fine compact clay with a black core.
The rim is decorated with three concentric lines and the upper half of the body is decorated
with incised decoration consisting of four sets of concentric circles with the smallest circle
of each set filled with punctates. These sets are divided by arched bands of parallel lines
with the border zones above and below the arches filled with parallel lines so closely spaced
they run together and sometimes overlap giving a roughened background effect to the circle
and arch motif. The decoration appears to have been applied when the paste was dry and
"leather hard." This decorative technique was noted by Bell (1972:245) as present on a
Crockett Curvilinear bowl from the Harlan site.
V-71 Crockett Curvilinear (Fig. 23,D). This is a carinated bowl 13.3 cm in height and
20.2 cm in diameter. The wall thickness at the rim is 5 mm and the undefined base is 7 mm
thick. It has an incised decoration consisting of alternating, opposed, punctate filled
triangles. In the center of each triangle is a small negative circle. The decoration of this
vessel resembles that of both Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Pennington Punctate Incised,
a difficulty often encountered when dealing with these closely related types. This difficulty
has been discussed by Krieger (1949:101-104) where he uses the term Crockett-Pennington
hybrid to describe similar motifs at the George C. Davis site and later Suhm and Jelks
(1962:121) state : "Between Crockett and Pennington an arbitrary line was drawn, and the
definitely curvilinear motifs were assigned to the former, the straight line motifs to the
latter." Because of the circular elements, Vessel V-71 is herein assigned to the type Crockett
Curvilinear Incised. Four incised lines decorate the rim. The paste is a fine compact clay
with grit temper and the core is black. The surface of the vessel is smoothed and is light
brown ill color.
V-72 Undesignated Engraved (Fig. 24,A). This is another carinated bowl very similar in
shape and design layout to V-69. It has a diameter of 30.9 cm and is 8.5 cm in height and
the color is reddish brown. The wall is 7 mm thick. The temper is clay and the paste is fine
and compact.
V-73 Paris Plain (Fig. 24,B). This carinated bowl is 6.67 cm in height. The diameter at
the rim is 14.6 cm, and the rim is 1.9 cm in height. The rim slants slightly toward the inside,
and is 6.5 mm thick. The paste is coarse textured with grog and grit temper. The core is dark
brown in color. The surface is poorly smoothed and has a light brown in color. The surface
is poorly smoothed and has a light brown slip. The Paris Plain ware was defined by Brown
(1971 : 65-67) from the Spiro site.

V-74 Undesignated Plain Bottle (Figure 24,C). This vessel is poorly made and slightly
lopsided: The height is 20.7 cm and the globular body is 11.0 cm in diameter. The flared rim
is 4.5 cm in diameter with a rim wall thickness of 5 mm. The disk base is 7.0 cm in
~diameter. The juncture between coils of the neck and the body was not smoothed out. The
surface is plain and poorly smoothed. It is light reddish brown in color.
V-75 Miniature Spiro Engraved (Fig. 24,D). This small cup has an undefined convex base
and vertical walls. The height is 3.9 cm and the outside diameter at the rim is 4.4 cm. The
base and the body wall are 3 mm thick. The color is medium gray with an engraved and
punctate design. The design consists of four parallel lines below the rim with a series of
boxed rectangles extending down from the lowest parallel line of the rim and another series
extending upward from the base. The boxed rectangles are in a series of four with the third
box filled with small punctates.
V-76 Undesignated (Fig. 24,E). This miniature vessel is 4.2 cm in height, 6.0 cm in
diameter at the rim, and 5.2 cm diameter at the base. The disk base extends beyond the
body wall on one side and is 7 mm thick. The vessel is very crude in form and the plain
surface is poorly smoothed. The rim is inverted. The color is light brown.
V-77 Spiro Engraved Bottle (Fig. 24,G). The overal! height of this vessel is 19.1 cm,
including the 9.5 cm neck. The wall thickness at the mouth is 3 mm, the body wall is 4 mm,
and the disk base is 11 mm thick.The paste is a black clay with grit and bone temper. The
outside surface is black with a smooth but unpolished surface. The engraved decoration is
crudely executed. In several instances the diagonal lines of the decoration extend below the
body onto the surface of the base. White pigment is present in the engraved lines.
V-78 Spiro Engraved Compound Bottle (Fig. 24,F). This miniature water bottle is !3.5
cm in height. The upper portion of the body is 6.5 cm in diameter and the lower portion is
5.9 cm in diameter. The diameter of the neck rim is 2.3 and the orifice is 1.7 cm. The neck
is 6.0 cm in height. The base is convex and the surface of the base is engraved with three
concentric lines. The smoothed but unpolished surface is engraved and the engraved lines
filled with red ochre. The engraved body decoration is a series of arched lines from the top
of the body to the base with cross lines on the inside of the arches. The neck has two
concentric lines near the top and there are two concentric lines at the base of the neck. A
small four-pointed star with an inner circle is engraved on the upper part of the body.

Ceramic Pipe
The pipe (not illustrated) associated with this feature is the Graves Chapel variety of
Red River pipe (Hoffman, 1967:9). It is reddish brown in color. The broken stem is 6.5 cm
in length, and 9 mm in diameter. The bore of the stem is 5 mm, and the wall thickness is 2
mm. The bowl is 2.7 cm in diameter, and its height is also 2.7 cm.
Feature No. 4

This feature is a probable house mound and midden. The mound is about 6 m in
diameter and about 40 cm in height. It is located at the highest point of the terrace (T-3)
between the confluence of the old drainage area, and the lower alluvial plain along the east
side of the site. The area is also the site of a recent (19007) cabin or house. A pot hole has
been dug into the mound.
Artifact Descriptions

Ceramics
A small collection consisting of daub and 15 sherds were found on the surface of the
feature. There are 2 plain shell tempered sherds and 1 3 predominantly clay tempered sherds
of which 4 have some type of decoration. One of the 4 is a rim sherd with slightly thinned
rounded lip and is reddish brown in color. The decoration consists of at least two crudely
incised lines that are parallel to the rim. It has a maximum thickness of 9 mm. Another clay
tempered decorated sherd is red filmed on both surfaces, is 5 mm thick, and has a multiple
line curvilinear engraved decoration with spurs along the outer line. Spurred lines made their
first appearance in the Late Gibson Aspect (Haley Focus) time period on such types as
Haley Engraved and was carried over into late Caddoan (Fulton Aspect) times where it was
common on types such as Avery Engraved. Another decorated sherd is clay tempered with a
minor amount of grit or fine sand. The decoration is a single incised line. The last decorated
sherd appears to be from a large Crockett Curvilinear Incised bowl or jar. It is 6 to 7 mm in
thickness and has smoothed, even reddish brown surfaces that are imperfectly burnished
with a slight luster in some areas.
Lithics
The lithic materials collected from the surface of Feature No. 4 consist of one pebble
core of black and brown Big Fork Chert (Fig. 27,H-J); a broken fragment of novaculite
pebble; two fragments of yellow jasper (claystone); a mid-secti0n of a piano-convex biface
of black petrified wood; a broken pebble of green chert; two unaltered flakes of Woodford
Chert, one of which is apparently bipolar; an end scraper of black and white novaculite; and,
an unfinished Gary type dart point of yellow siltstone with a brown cortex. The materials
are not substantially different from those recovered from Feature No. 1.
Feature No. 5
This feature is located on the same terrace (T-3) about 125 m due south of Feature No.
4. It appears to be a house mound because of the presence of daub, but with less noticeable
midden material than Feature No. 4. The mound is oval shaped with the long axis parallel to

CUL TURA L FEA TURES

the terrace edge to the east. The mound is roughly 7 by 10 m. The entire surface of the
terrace is covered in Bermuda grass pasture. The area has been cultivated in the past, and it
is probable that the mound features (4 and 5) have been lowered by the original clearing
operation.and subsequent plowing.
Artifact Descriptions

Ceramics
The surface collection from Feature No. 5 consists of 12 sherds of which 8 are shell
tempered and 4 are predominantly clay tempered. Of the 8 shell tempered sherds 2 are
red-filmed on both surfaces and one is fihned on the exterior only. The clay tempered
sherds appear to have minor amounts of grit and bone added to the paste. One clay
tempered sherd has a dark purplish red slip possibly similar to that described for some
Sanders Plain wares (Brown, 1971: 164). The other sherd is red-fihned on both surfaces.
Lithic debris was not collected. A small rectangular piano-convex mano about 7 by 12 cm
made of reddish brown sandstone was found on the surface approximately 75 m southeast
of Feature No. 5.
Feature No. 6
This feature was exposed by the sloughing of the river bank after the flood of
December, 197i. During this particular flood, approximately 15 acres of the site were
removed by flood waters, exposing a new and different profile of the terrace soils.
In a section of bank which had fallen from its original position, an area in the clay
matrix about 60 cm in length, 30 cm in width, and about 15 cm in depth, contained bones
of what appeared to be a single individual. Bone fragments were also collected from the
surface of the talus below the burial. Although the burial was not in original position, it was
oriented east-west, with skull fragments to the east.
The dark gray clay containing the bone material was identical to a stratum 90 cm below
the surface of the terrace and also to a stratum at a depth of 3.6 m. Both strata were above
the location where the burial was found. No artifacts of stone, bone or shell were found
when the bone was removed. The only artifacts found at this time were fragments of a single
ornament of copper. It was a thin shell of native copper in an advanced stage of
decomposition. The longest fragment is 1.9 cm in length and 1.1 cm in width. It appears to
have been tapered at one end. The remaining trace of copper inside the corroded area
indicates that it covered an object which was either rectangular in cross section, or that the
copper could not be rolled tightly on a round stem, such as a bone hairpin. The void in the
center of the fragment is rectangular and 2 by 3 ram.
The smaller fl-agment is 1.1 cm in length and 4.5 mm in width, but it consists of one-half
of the rolled copper, split longitudinally. Traces of wood fiber remain entrusted inside this
fragment. Because of the copper covered bone hairpins found in Burial No. 1, the normal
assumption would be that these fragments represent a bone hairpin, but this item seems to
indicate a wooden core for the copper overlay. The skeletal material was examined by Dr.
Claud Bramblett, University of Texas in Austin, and found to represent three, and possibly
four individuals. The sex and age determinations are as follows: (1) A juvenile tess than 10
years of age; (2) a young adult male; (3) an elderly male; and, (4) possibly a young adult
female (based on examination of a maxilla).

CUL TURAL FEA TURES

During examination of the skeletal material, two fragments of a polished bone hairpin were
found. One fragment is 4.8 cm in length, 5 by 6 mm at one end, and flattened to a diameter
of 10 mm width and 2 mm thickness at the other end. The other fragment is 6.9 cm in
length and 5 mm in diameter. Both fragments are made of solid bone. Obviously, this
feature represented a bundle burial.
Feature No. 7

Feature No. 7 may be either a burial or a house site. It is represented by a concentration
of plain and decorated sherds. No discoloration in the soil was noted. The sherds were not
collected and were intentionally left to mark the location for future work. Fragments of a
red slipped engraved vessel (Avery Engraved?) with shell temper were present. The feature is
considered contemporaneous with the buried occupation zone (Feature No. 8).

Feature No. 8
This is a buffed occupation zone with occasional concentrations of midden materials
extending for an exposed distance of approximately 1400 ft in the cut bank of the river.
The stratum varies in thickness from 20 cm to 155 cm. The stratum is not exposed on the
surface of the terrace and the nearest point of outcrop is 48 cm below the surface. The
greatest thickness of the dark gray sandy clay is approximately 90 m west of the
Bentsen-Clark property line where the top of the cultural zone is 3.14 m below the surface.
This area (Fig. 26) was originally an old channel scar which had been used as a dump and
subsequently was filled by the agrading river with alternate thin beds of sand and silt until
the surface was leveled. The zone pinches out at the west edge of another channel scar near
the eastern escarpment of the site. This channel scar was not filled with sediment at the
same time of the scar to the west. In fact, this scar is still evident on the surface (Fig. 5,A).
The distance between the two scars is approximately 1400 ft.
Artifact Descriptions
The artifacts recovered in situ from this zone consist ahnost entirely of ceramic sherds.
A few charred bone fragments and the right mandible of a skunk represent the faunal
remains.
Cermnics
A total of 59 sherds and an abrader were collected from the scattered midden materials
in the cultural zone. The sherd total includes 34 with shell temper, of which 27 are plain
body sherds, 3 are classified as Nash Neck Banded, 3 have an applique design and one has a
horizontal row of punctates. The predominant color is lighter shades of red and the paste is
firm and compact.

Only four of the shell tempered sherds appear to be polished, the

remaining ~ 1 are poorly to well smoothed.
The three Nash Neck

Banded sherds are from everted rim jars (Fig. 27,F,G) and

probably many of the plain body sherds as well as the punctate and applique sherds are
from vessels of this type. One of the applique sherds has a red slip on the exterior surface.
There are 24 predominately clay tempered sherds from this midden. At least 8 of these
apparently have minor amounts of grit, bone and/or kaolin included in the temper. The one
decorated sherd in this group has a fingernail impressed design and is from the rim of a jar.
This sherd has a horizontal row of linear fingernail impressions at the top of the rim and
below this, alternating bands of diagonal and horizontal rows.
The predominant colors in this group are reddish brown and gray. The paste varies in
texture from coarse to fine and is generally firm and compact. The surfaces are poorly to
welt smoothed and five sherds are slightly polished.

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

69

The remaining sherd from this midden has some clay and kaolin in the tempering
material but has a high percentage of grit or fine sand. The exterior of this sherd is
reddish-tan in color and is unevenly smoothed with a slight luster. The interior is poorly
smoothed and has a sandy appearance.
Lithics
The abrader (Figs. 27,B and 27,C) is made of a hard dense fine grained quartzitic
sandstone. The abraded surface is medium gray in color and the remaining surfaces of the
artifact are weathered to a light reddish brown color. The specimen is triangular and
lenticular with a thickness of 9 mm, a length of 9.1 cm, and a maximum width of 5.3 cm.
The abrader was literally worn through by the semi-circular grooves on both surfaces whose
axes crisscrossed with a maximum angle of 3 degrees. Both grooves deepen from one side of
the stone to the other. The greatest widths of the two grooves are 7 and 9 mm, and the
greatest depth of both grooves is 4 mm. The grooves are not straight but are slightly arced,
and both grooves have longitudinal striations probably resulting from use of sand as an
abrasive agent.

Disassociated Artifacts
Lithic
The only surface artifact not found in association with one of the eight known features
is a celt (Figs. 27,D and 27,E) which was found near the crest of the terrace to the south of
the old channel scar which dissects the site. It was on the same terrace but approximately
400 m west of Feature No. 4. The artifact is specifically mentioned because of the lithic
material. Although it has no association with any feature, it may be contemporaneous with
the occupation of the house mounds located on the same terrace level.

The celt is made of a very dense fine grained tuff. The color on the polished bit is a dark
greenish black, and the unpolished pecked surface âis a lighter shade. The green tinge is
probably caused by the chlorite content. Under a 60X binocular microscope, grains of
plagioclase feldspar and quartz are recognizable. The rock appears to closely resemble tuff
Specimen No. 58 described by Honess (1923:182).
The celt is roughly rectangular in shape. It is 7.7 cm in length and 4.0 cm in maximum
width. It tapers from a thickness of 3.2 cm near the squared base to the keen cutting edge of
the bit. The rock was first chipped into shape, and then pecked and ground. The butt end is
battered indicating use as a hammer or as the butt end of a chisel.

Ceramic
An additional ceramic vessel (Fig. 28) of unknown provenience is described because of
the unusual design. The vessel is not included in the discussion of ceramics.
The sherds of the vessel were found at the edge of the river and had apparently eroded
from the cutbank. The location was slightly downstream from Feature Nos. 1 and 3 and
may have been associated with one of them.

71

The vessel appears to be a bottle with an extended, circular, and slightly convex base
The basal thickness and the body wall vary from 4 to 4.5 mm. The body is a squat ovaloid
form with the maximum diameter (approximately 15 cm) below the mid-line. The basal
extension below the body is 2.5 cm in height.
The engraved body decoration is unusua! with concentric circles, semi-circles and arcs,
punctate bands, excised dots and triangular corners, and circular lines widened by excising.
The different techniques complement each other in a complex motif. Four concentric bands
on the basal extension are incised.
The paste is firm, hard, and compact, and the apparent temper is clay-grit. The exterior
color is reddish brown with black firing c!ouds. The interior color and the core is gray. The
exterior surface is smoothed and slightly uneven with horizontal tool marks and is slightly
polished. The interior is unsmoothed.

Pigments
Pigments evident at the site consist of red, green, and white materials. The three types
have not been tested, but they appear to be made from common mineral bases with little or
no alteration.
The red pigment can be easily identified as ochre produced from hematite which occurs
commonly as concretions on Red River gravel bars or from outcrops of the Blossom Sand
formation. Similar materia! from Burial 24 at the Haley site was identified by John Boyd as
"iron in the form of hematite" by using spectroscopic analyses (Perino, ! 967:4). The ochre
at the Bentsen-Clark site was present as a mass of pigment (probably in a perishable
container) used as a funeral offering in Feature No. 1 and as pigment rubbed into engraved,
incised, and excised portions of several vessels from Feature Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
The green pigment retained as a mass in a broken vessel from Feature No. 1 was a dull
gray-green color and was intermixed with coarse grains of quartz sand. Unlike the green
material at Haley identified as chromium (ibid), the material in the vessel at Bentsen-Clark is
probably glauconitic sand. Green material also occurred in Feature Nos. 1 and 3 as a
pigment rubbed on several vessels. It possibly represents a different material from that
contained in the vessel because of its finer texture resembling bentonitic clay. The
glauconite is commonly known as an amorphous iron silicate, and it occurs in the Bonham
Clay and the Blossom Sand formations.
The white pigment was present in the engraved lines of a Spiro bottle (V-77) from
Feature No. 3. The material is probably kaolinite. Kaolinite occurs as compact, friable,
mealy, or clay-like masses which result from post volcanic, pneumatolytic, and
hydrothermal processes upon aluminous minerals. It also occurs as ordinary weathering as
secondary deposits resulting from transportation and deposition under water (Kraus, Hunt,
and Ramsdell, 1951:390). Leached shell and kaolinite are often confused as a tempering
material in Caddoan pottery because of the fact that kaolinite partially decomposes in
hydrochloric acid and is, therefore, often considered leached shell. One of the best
distinguishing characteristics of kaolinite is the plasticity produced by adding moisture.

CULTURAL FEATURES

72
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The Bentsen-Clark site is a dual component site representing some part of Stages 1I, III
and VI (Davis, 9170: 43-48) of Caddoan chronology. To date, the extensive site has
exhibited eight cultural features, four of which have been destroyed by lateral cutting of the
Red River into the Cooke terrace.
The features which have been most significant in the interpretation of the site are two
shaft burials (Feature Nos. 1 and 3) and a buried occupation zone (Feature No. 8)
containhag midden materials. The two shaft burials were not associated with mound
structures and Feature No. 1 appears to have been used for a primary retinue burial and
later for secondary bundle burials and possibly single interments. In Feature No. 1 artifacts
that are typical of the Alto, Sanders, Spiro, and Haley foci are represented, and on this basis
a tentative date approaching !300 A.D. is suggested. Feature No. 3 may have preceded No.
1, but the time lapse was not very long. Based on the selectivity of individuals, Feature No.
1 appears to represent a specialized burial, and the singularity of artifact association
(ceramic) in Feature No. 3 also suggests a specialized burial.
The midden material consisting primarily of late ceramic types such as Nash Neck
Banded, Avery Engraved, and shell tempered plain sherds was separated from the earlier
shaft burials by several feet of sterile soils, and the thickest section of the midden is
currently below 10 ft of sterile stratified clays and sands of channel fill.
The diversity and complexity of mortuary practices evident at the site indicate a
stratified social system probably based on an agricultural society. However, there have been
no village excavations or observed surface artifacts reflecting agricultural subsistence. A
possible explanation of the apparent sparsity of mullers, manos, and metates is the usage of
wooden mortars and pestles.
Exotic materials indicative of trade are the conch shell dipper and beads, marginella shell
beads, and possibly the copper, one variety of diorite, and greenstone. The trade items
reflect a primary influence from the southeast, while the Holly Fine Engraved vessel (V-53)
may be an heirloom or a trade item from other Caddoan people to the south or east, and a
single arrowpoint (Haskell) may be indicative of trade from Spiro.
More research and analysis will be required to substantiate a definite connection, but
based on the lithic materials recovered so far there is a strong probability the majority of
lithic resources were derived from the Glover Creek area either by direct exploitation or by
local trade with the Caddoan peoples in that area. With the exception of greenstone or
siliceous shale, Woodford Chert, and Sallisaw Chert, and possible diorite, all the lithic
materials are found in the Glover Creek basin area. The materials, with the exception of
Colbert Creek diorite, are also available throughout the southern Ouachitas, but no other
single area contains as high a percentage as Glover Creek basin.
The fact that the major portion of the site lies well below the plow zone presents
problems in designing future archeological research, but at the same time, it has and will
continue to protect the cu!tural horizon from disturbance by human vandalism and
agricultural activities. Cunâently, the portion of the site with evident features is in Bermuda
grass pasture and will probably remain so for an indefinite period of time.

SUMMAR Y AND CONCLUSIONS

73

The geologic separation of the Gibson and Fulton materia! is believed to be potentially
unique in providing data for the little understood transition period. This geologic separation
also strongly implies extensive flooding at high elevations and may be indicative of a
climatic change. It is also important to note that the most recent material was deeply buried
on a relatively high terrace. This implies even deeper burial for older sites or sites that were
originally lower in elevation along the lower Red River. The presence of deeply buried strata
emphasize the need for deeper subsurface exploration, such as core sampling, in connection
with many archaeological investigations.
Many characteristics of the burial ceramics at Bentsen-Clark are present in other Red
River Valley Caddoan sites, but as an assemblage it does not appear to be closely related to
any site where recorded information is available. Probably the closest relationship would be
Burial Q in Mound C at the Crenshaw site (Dinham and Kizzia, 1964). This burial with
several Spiro Engraved vessels, including one oblong or boatshaped vessel with almost
identical size, shape, and design layout to one from Bentsen-Clark was thought to be "the
single most elaborate and probably the latest Caddoan burial in the mound" (it may have
been dug from the last mount surface; Hoffman, 1970:170). Other traits shared include
Hickory Engraved bottles, red-filming of plain and decorated vessels, human effigy pipes,
Red River (long stemmed) pipes, caches of Hayes arrowpoints and recurred bifaces
(Gahagan). This seems to be enough data to suggest a possible temporal relationship for
Burial Q at Crenshaw and Feature Nos. 1 and 3 at Bentsen-Clark.

Several items found in the burials at Bentsen-Clark compare favorably with material
described for the Hochatown Complex in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, particularly Burial
Four at the Beaver site. This burial contained a Spiro Engraved bottle and a bowl with rim
spouts very similar to vessels found at Bentsen-Clark (Wyckoff, 1968: P1.26, 1, 2).
Possibly the closest ceramic relationship to Bentsen-Clark lies in the Arkansas River
Valley where almost every item found in the burials at Bentsen-Clark could be duplicated at
the Spiro site. The many similarities in pottery types, vessel shapes, decorative techniques
and design layouts have been listed above.
Many of the similar ceramic traits found at Bentsen-Clark and Spiro occur in both the
Harlan and Spiro Phases at the latter site, but included in the Spiro Phase at the Spiro Site
were several pottery types such as Friendship, Glassel, Hempstead, Hodges Engraved, and
Nash Neck Banded, all commonly found in the late Caddoan Period (Fulton Aspect). These
pottery types were considered exotic ware at Spiro, and Brown (1971 : 219) believes "the
number of types, potentially derivable from the Red River and Ouachita River Valleys is
quantitatively respectable" and that "the largest number can be attributed to the McCurtain
Phase on the Red River." The absence of these McCurtain and Mid-Ouachita phase pottery
types at Bentsen-Clark which is located on Red River in the McCurtain Phase area suggest
that the burials at the site are slightly earlier that the Spiro Phase at Spiro.
Pottery types such as Haley and Handy Engraved were also present in the Spiro Phase at
Spiro and "can be attributed to the Haley Phase" (Brown, 1971: 219). The absence of
Haley and Handy Engraved in Burial Q, at Crenshaw (which has a Haley Phase component)

74

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

suggests that it is slightly earlier than the Haley Focus. These data suggest that Feature Nos.
1 and 3 at Bentsen-Clark have a temporal relationship to the late Harlan or early Spiro Phase
in the Arkansas River Valley and the Lost Prairie Phase in the Red River Valley.
The large number of ceramic pottery vessels and sherd groups representing vessels found
in burials at Bentsen-Clark reveal a wtriety of pottery types in a wide variety of vessel shapes
and decorative techniques.
In all, some 77 individual vessels plus 288 miscellaneous sherds were present in the two
shaft burials. The similarity of ceramic type, vessel shapes, design layout, and decorative
technique leaves little doubt that the two are chronologically related.
The major pottery type present is Spiro Engraved. Although this type has a wide
distribution in the Caddoan area as a whole, it is "indigenous to the Arkansas River Valley"
(Brown, 1971:119), where it has been recorded at the Spiro (Brown, 1971), Hartan (Bell,
1972:247) and Brackett (Bareis, 1955: 28-30) sites. At Bentsen-Clark this type is
represented by 22 of the 61 vessels in Burial 1 and 4 of 17 vessels in Burial 3 similar in vessel
shape and design layout to examples from the Spiro site.
Narrow mouthed bottles with design layouts which include sets of concentric circles or
spirals divided by bands of parallel diagonal lines have counter parts from Spiro (Brown,
1971 : Figs. 14, e and 14, f). Other bottles have designs combining curvilinear and rectilinear
elements similar to one illustrated from Spiro (Brown, 1971: Fig. 16, g).
Bowl forms with these same design layouts are present at both sites including vessels with
collared rims and peaked and/or spouted rims (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: P1. 74, b and 74, e).
The closely related Holly Engraved type is represented by two vessels, a large mouthed
bottle and a carinated bowl. The bottle (V-53, Fig. 19, A) has the classic Holly fine line
decoration with bands of multiple closely spaced parallel lines, alternating with excised
units. The design layout and execution is identical to vessels recorded from the George C.
Davis site (Newell and Krieger, 1949: Fig. 29, K) and probably the vessel shape is the same
although the reconstructed drawing of the vessel from Davis (Newell and gxieger, 1949 : Fig.
30,J) shows a somewhat different jar form. Vessels with this classic type Holly decoration
are very rare in the Red River Valley and when found, possible .trade connections with the
Alto Focus must be considered.
The carinated bowl (V-4) is red-filmed with alternate vertical and diagonal bands of
parallel lines with excised corners. Similar vessels were recorded at Davis, however none
were red-filh~ed. This motif and vessel shape is not uncommon in the Red River Valley
where it has been recorded at the Washington site (Harrington, !929:P1. 37, b) and is
present at Crenshaw (personal inspection of the Lemley Collection). The Crenshaw example
is red-filmed with white pigment in the lines and excised areas of the design and was found
in a burial containing Hickory Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Pennington Punctate
Incised and two jars with hacised and punctate designs which have been identified as Haley
Complicated Incised (Suhm and Jelks, 1962: P1. 30, e, i) and three Red River pipes of the
Graves Chapel variety (Hoffman, 1967: 9). The artifacts from this Crenshaw burial meet the
criteria for placement in the Lost Prairie Phase as described by Hoffman (1970: 169-171).
At the Bentsen-Clark site, Hickory Engraved is represented by four narrow mouthed
bottles. This type is found throughout the Caddoan Area in components of the Alto,
Gahagan, Spiro, and Haley foci (Suhm and Jelks, 1962:71).
There tends to be a gradual shift in vessel shape from bottles with globular or spherical
bodies and strongly tapered necks in the earlier components to more elongated bodies with
cylindrical necks in the later components. The Hickory Engraved bottles from

SUMMAR Y AND CONCLUSIONS

75

Bentsen-Clark all have strongly tapered necks.
Crockett Curvilinear Incised is represented by five vessels with scroll or scroll derived
designs. This wide spread type is found throughout the Caddoan Area and has a life span
covering the entire early Caddoan time period (Gibson Aspect).
Other incised types present include two Kiam Incised jars and two East Incised bowls.
The complete jar identified as Kiam Incised (V-66, Fig. 22, E) has the typical crudely
incised Kiam rim but also has a single horizontal row of"fingernail" punctates on the body
just below the rim, resembling those found on Weches Fingernail Impressed vessels. The
deep bowl identified as East Incised (V-12) has a collared rim with two opposed rim peaks.
This bowl is somewhat atypical in decoration, having only a single line bounding the lower
edge of the collar. This line dips down below the rim peaks, a trait common in the East
Incised type. The vessel shape seems to be more common in the Spiro area than in the Red
River Valley. Several bowls from Spiro with this type rim are decorated in the Spiro
Engraved style (Brown, 1971: Figs. 14, g,h,j) as well as one identified as East Incised
(Brown, 1971: Fig. 10,d).
At Bentsen-Clark, 11 of the 78 pottery vessels in Feature Nos. 1 and 3 are red-filmed.
Decorative types combined with red-filming include five Spiro Engraved and one Holly
Engraved in addition to four narrow mouthed bottles without decoration (Sanders Plain).
Red-filming has not been recorded for the Alto and Gahagan foci but at other Red River
Valley sites such as Crenshaw and Bowman, red-filming is present in both the Lost Prairie
and Haley phases. At Crenshaw some Holly Engraved and East Incised vessels are red-filmed
in addition to Sanders Plain (personal inspection of the Lemley material).
At Bowman, on material reported to be from Mound One, red-filming was noted on
Hickory Engraved bottles and bowls with excised and engraved decoration (personal
inspection of material reported to be from Mound 1, Burial 8).
In the Arkansas River Valley, red-filming is apparently rare in the Evans and Harlan
Phases but more common in the subsequent Spiro Phase. A single bottle, classified as
Sanders Plain was found in middle period burial at the Harlan site (Bell, 1972:247). At
Spiro, red-filmed vessels classified as Sanders Engraved, Maxey Noded Redware, Spiro
Engraved, Poteau Plain, and Poteau Engraved occur in Great Mortuary and Post-Great
Mortuary contexts (Brown, 1971). In the early Caddoan time period (Gibson Aspect) plain
red-filmed vessels are usually classified as Sanders Plain and this, by inference, suggests a
chronological relationship with the Sanders Focus; however, it is quite possible that many of
these plain red-film vessels, particularly bottles with spherodial body and strongly tapered
necks, pre-date the earliest known Sanders Focus components.
There are three jars with loop handles all from Feature No. 1. In the Red River drainage
handles of either the loop or strap variety probably make their first appearance fairly late
within the Early Caddoan period (Gibson Aspect). None were recorded for the Alto or
Gahagan Foci, but are unknown to be present in the Sanders Focus.
At the multi-component Crenshaw and Bowman sites, handles are absent in the lost.
Prairie Phase and make their first appearance in a later Haley phase context (Hoffman,
1970: 170-171).
The earliest appearance of handles in the Caddoan Area is probably in the Arkansas
River Valley where loop handles are present on shell tempered jars of the Harlan Phase at
the Harlan Site (Bell, 1972: Pls. !3,i, 19-2, 25,a, and 25, e). At the Spiro site loop and strap
handles are present in the Spiro phase (Brown, 1971 ).

76

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

At least nine vessels from Feature Nos. 1 and 3 at Bentsen-Clark have traces of green
pigment rubbed on one or both surfaces. This trait has been recorded at the Ozan
(Harrington, 1920: 31) and Washington sites (Harrington, 1920: 64) in what Krieger
considers to be a Haley Focus context (Newell and Krieger, 1949: 207). A deep burial in
Mound B at Crenshaw contained a Crockett Curvilinear Incised bowl with traces of green
pigment rubbed on both surfaces (personal inspection of the Lemley material). This burial
also contained vessels of Hickory Engraved, Wilkinson Punctate, Davis Incised and East
Incised and possibly belongs in the Lost Prairie Phase which is the earliest Caddoan
component recognized at the Crenshaw site.
The sherds collected from the midden zone exposed ha the river bank, in the area of the
burials, would appear to be from a later occupation of the site. A good many of these sherds
are shell tempered, some of which can be identified as jars of the Nash Neck Banded type.
This ceramic type is common in the McCurtain Focus which is thought to be one of the
later (Fulton Aspect) Caddoan phases.
The sherds collected from the surface of Feature Nos. 4 and 5 possibly represent more
than one occupation with sherds of Crockett Curvilinear Incised and possibly Sanders Plain
representing the earlier occupation, the shell tempered w~e and the curvilinear engraved
sherds with spurred lines representing the later. An alternate hypothesis would be a single
occupation of a transitional nature which more or less bridges the gap between the two. In
any case, the relationship of sherds from the midden and Feature Nos. 4 and 5 to
construction of the mounds, and to the burials erodhag from the river bank, are problems
that only extensive controlled excavation can resolve.

APPENDIX
AN OSTEOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE HUMAN SKELETAL MATERIALS
FROM THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE

By
Jane Buikstra and Diedre Fowler
INTRODUCTION

The human skeletons reported here include all burials collected by Gregory Perino,
Quintus Herron, William Denison and Larry Banks from a Caddoan shaft grave (Feature No.
1 ) at the Bentsen-Clark site located in Red River County, Texas. The burials are believed by
Perino and Banks to date ca. 1300 A.D. because of the late Gibson appearance of some of
the associated grave goods.
This series does not represent a total sample of individuals buried in the tomb. Sloughing
of the bank left an estimated 20 percent of the shaft burial untouched in September of
1969 when the scattered and in situ materials were collected. According to Perino (personal
communication), the burials included both primary extended skeletons, which formed a
bottom layer on a cane matting floor, and successive layers of primary and secondary
reburials. The series will be treated here as a single ossuary, since the lack of provenience
data and the fragmentary nature of the series precludes the identification of individual
skeletons.
The first part of this analysis will emphasize the burial behavior evident from an
identification of bones present and the determination of demographic parameters such as
sex and age of the individuals at death. Here we are gathering information concernh~g
differential access to burial in this feature. If the mortality profile for the series does not
approximate what one might expect in a "normal" cemetery population, then the social
group was making a conscious decision in limiting access to the cemetery. The extent to
which this decision can be explained simply by sex or age-related roles can be associated
with a certain level of social complexity (cf. Binford, 1971; Saxe, 1970, for extended
discussion of this relationship). Without additional, systematic excavations of total sites,
extensive interpretation here would be premature. Therefore, discussion will be limited to a
comparison of burials at the Sam Kaufman site which apparently dated 150-200 years later
in the Fulton Aspect (Skinner, Harris and Anderson, 1969).
The second section of this report will focus upon elements of skeletal morphology other
than those associated with sexual dimorphism, and age-related changes. Discussion will
emphasize inherited variables which may be useful for biological distance comparison.
Observations concerning pathology and artificial cranial deformation are also included.

BURIAL BEHAVIOR

Minimum Number of Individuals
One child and a minimum of 31 adults and sub-adults were buried at Bentsen-Clark. The
most frequently occurring bone was the right humerus, distal end.

THE BÂ£)VTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

Differential Distribution of Body Parts
The minimum number of individuals represented by each bone is listed in Table 1. It is
obvious that the distribution reflects a nonrandom selection of body parts. It is also evident
that the first half of the list included sections of the largest bones of the body: the long
bones, the skull, and the innominates. Small bones are either poorly represented (carpals)

or completely absent (distal; hand and foot phalanges). The differences in frequencies of
contiguous elements such as the calcaneus, talus, small tarsals, and foot phalanges suggests
that it was customary for the dead to be skeletonized prior to final interment. Since there is
no evidence of cutting near ligamentous or tendinous attachments, we must assume that
disarticulation followed a period of natural soft tissue decomposition.
We can compare the distribution of body parts from Bentsen-Clark to that of another
site where selection had also taken place. Fairty Ossuary, an Iroquois site located in Ontario,
Canada, is thought to represent secondary reburials of all the dead for a village which had
accumulated as primary burials for a period of approximately ten years (Anderson,
1964:28). From Andersonâs inventory, one can derive a list of adult skeletal parts described
in terms of minimum numbers of individuals present. The Fairty listing is shown in Table 2.
From a comparison of Tables 1 and 2, we see that the criteria for selection of bones for
reburial differ for the two sites. Although Anderson (1964: 32) emphasizes the fact that the
tali and the patellae are under-represented due to aboriginal selection of large bones for
reburial, he is considering combined immatmâe-adult categories. Limiting the discussion here
to adult bones, it is apparent that bone density or "hardness" was much more important in
bone selection than size at Fairty. Most of the !ong bones occur relatively infrequently, with
small, dense bones such as the first and second cervical vertebrae, the patella, and the talus
appearing high in the listing.

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

This situation contrasts with that at Bentsen-Clark, where selection against small size
produced a much different frequency distribution.
Although local conditions affecting bone preservation may have contributed to this
dissimilarity, it is obvious that the selection of body parts for reburial involved different
procedures at Bentsen-Clark and Fairty. These differences are best explained as by-products
of certain aspects of the burial program rather than overt prehistoric selection of "special"
bones. Factors which would affect the distribution of bones actually interred as a reburial
would include the distance over which the body was carried, the amount of wrapping on the
body, and the amount of ceremony which required manipulation of the bones. With these
data from a single mortuary site, we cannot identify the procedures which were critical in
bone selection for final internment in the Bentsen-Clark shaft grave. The loci of
intermediate post-mortem treatment must be identified and studied. However, given the
information we do have on ossuary burial, we must expect the schedule of Caddoan
mortuary activity to differ from that characteristic of Iroquoian mortuary tradition.
Age at Death
One child, five sub-adults, and at least 26 adults were buried in the shaft tomb. The
child, represented by the major long bones and part of the pelvis, appears to be between 6
and 10 years of biological age. The ischium and the pubis have fused; however, the ilium is
still a distinct unit. Although this fusion does not occur until puberty o-- approximately 12
years of age - the small size of the long bones suggests that 10 years is a reasonable upper
limit.
The most frequently occurring sub-adult body part is the right head of femur. Five
individuals lack complete fusion of the head to the neck. Of t.hese, two show the greater
trochanter to be in the process of fusing. This fusion is supposed to occur between 16 and
17 years of age (MacKay, 1961). Of the remaining three sub-adults, two show complete
fusion of the proximal femoral epiphyses, with the distal epiphysis remaining discrete. If
these individuals are female, they are probably about 17 years old; if male, slightly older,
but no older than nineteen. The other individual is intermediate in fusion sequence between
the two pairs already mentioned. The lesser trochanter is fused (greater trochanter missing),
and the head is unfused. This individual is probably near 17 years of age.
The age estimates derived from the femora are consistent with evidence from other body
parts: one of the younger individuals probably can be associated with the mandible
containing an unerupt-ed, but partially developed pair of third molars, with two of the older
individuals showing erupted M3s with incomplete root tips. Other evidence from the crania
and post-crania also support the evidence for five sub-adults ranging in age from
approximately 15 to 20 years.
The small number of pubic elements forced dependence upon the less reliable
information available from endocranial suture closure and dental attrition for ageing the
adult skeletons. Seven individuals show complete fusion of the endocranial sutures, which
would suggest a biological age in excess of 50 years (Todd and Lyon, 1924). One intact skull
had incomplete fusion of the coronal suture with the remaining sutures unaltered by ageing
effects. Another three fragmentary skulls showed pars bregmatica and verticis of the sagittal
suture with complete fusion, indicating that these were at least 35 years of age at death. In
sum, the degree of endocranial suture closure suggests the presence of at least 7 old adults,
10 young adults and 4 individuals who were of intermediate age.
As a check upon these relative frequencies, the degree of attrition apparent upon the

APPENDIX

83

first mandibular molar of all adults was cast into one of the following categories:
t. Slight attrition: Although cusps may show enamel faceting and dentin exposure,
none of the cusps show dentin exposure continuous (coalescing) with any other cusp.
All cusps are distinct.
2. Moderate Attrition: Only two cusps are coalesced.
3. Heavy attrition: thiee or more cusps are coalesced.
If both lower molars were present, the most heavily worn tooth was evaluated.
Ten individuals showed a slight degree of attfiton; 10 moderate; and six heavy. The
slight and heavy categories appear to duplicate the information gained from the study of
endocrania! suture closure. However, there is here an indication of several adults of
intermediate (middle) age whose calottes were not observable.
In sum, the adult age categories approximate what one might expect in a prehistoric
cemetery. Nearly equal numbers of young (10) and middle-aged (10) adults are present,
with a minority of older individuals (6 or 7). Five older adolescents or sub-adults and one
child complete the population. It appears therefore, that adult age strongly favored access to
burial in this shaft grave. However, once adult status was achieved, further selection by age
alone did not occur.
Sex

Ideally, all sex-specific characters from a single individua! should be evaluated separatelyand then brought to bear upon a single determination of sex for a single skeleton. In such a
case, the absolute sex ratio" for a series can be estimated with a fair degree of accuracy.
However, in a fragmented and fragmentary "ossuary" series, the problem becomes one of
simply determining a relative sex ratio for the series. Only isolated bones can be evaluated,
and they cannot be associated with the more reliable structures of the pelvis. Often
observations upon the various bones will not agree in absolute number, but unless results are
completely contradictory, one can still answer the general (and important) question: Was
access to this cemetery dependent upon sex of the individual and if so, does this also relate
to the age distribution of the burials? In order to answer this question for the Bentsen-Clark
series, subjective observations of dimorphic characters of the pelvis, skull, and humerus were
made. In addition, measurements taken upon the canine teeth and the head of femur were
evaluated for bimodality.
Table 3 summarizes the morphological observations of characters which are known to
reflect sexual dimorphism in other series. Although the predicted number of males and
females is not absolutely the same for all criteria, all do consistently support the statement
that there are fewer females in the series than males. This argument is strengthened by
observation of the distribution of certain measurements taken upon the canine teeth and the
head of femur.
Fig. 1 shows the frequency distribution of maximum diameters for the forty-five
measurable femur heads. The distribution is bimodal, with 15 measurements falling within
the small or "female" group and 29 in the larger, "male" category. The remaining
measurement forms the interface between the two groups.
The maximum bucco-lingual diameters of the left mandibular canine - the measurement
which could be taken most frequently on the Bentsen-Clark canine teeth - also show a
tendency to cluster at the high end of the range. Of the fourteen measureable teeth, only
five fall below a mean of 7.9 mm. The remaining nine are larger, with diameters ranging
between 8.0 and 8.6.

84

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

In sum, al! evidence indicates that there are fewer female diagnostic skeletal parts in the
Bentsen-Clark series than there are male. Information from measurements taken on the head
of femur and the canine teeth support morphologic observations of mandible and humerus
which indicate that there may be twice as many males as females in the series.

The sciatic notch and the temporal bones indicate a more conservative estimate of the
disparity in numbers, but all data are consistent with an uneven sex ratio. In terms of the
burial program this means that males had greater probability of being accorded pit burial
than females.
Although the construction of a complete Life Table is impossible, given the nature of
the series, a limited number of observations can be made concerning the age and sex of
certain individuals whose crania were reasonably intact. All seven individuals whose
lambdoid sutures were completely closed showed well developed mastoid processes,
suprameatal crests, and brow ridges. Five of the six mandibles with heavy attrition on the
first molars have bilateral chins and vertical ascending rami. Apparently the oldest members
of the burial population were predominantly or even exclusively male. Since the removal of
the old males from the sample would nearly eliminate the male bias in the sex ratio, we may
infer that the rules defining access to shaft burial included sex as a variable only in adults
who died at an advanced age.
Copper Stains
Complete treatment of the burial program followed at Bentsen-Clark would require
extensive information concerning individual graves and their associated elements.
Unfortunately, the only evidence we have concerning the locus of burial goods in the area
excavated by the collectors comes from the copper stains on a few of the bones.
The
inventory of grave goods recovered from the site included several copper strips, three
copper-covered bone hairpins in the form of serpents, and at least four copper-covered stone
earspools. Two mandibles show copper stains on the left ascending rami. One of these
mandibles is [~om an old adult male. The other ramus is definitely more gracile and from a
younger person, perhaps a young adult female.

APPENDIX

85

The only other copper stains were found on frontal bones. In one indiviclual, the stain is
in the midline slightly above the midpoint between bregma and giabeila. The stain was
roughly circular and had a diameter of approximately 2.75 cm. Another frontal fragment
showed a somewhat linear stain on the left side extending posterolaterally from the midline.
Both fragments were from young individuals whose coronal sutures showed no sign of
closure. The brow ridges were not well-developed, but since these could be sub-adults a
more than tentative female assignation would be over-stating the evidence.

Comparison with the Burial Program from the Sam Kaufman Site.
Two burial procedures followed at Kaufman are associated with an occupation only
slightly later in time than that at Bentsen-Clark. One of these is a relatively shallow pit
containing multiple burials (4) and the other is a deep shaft roughly comparable to that at
Bentsen-Clark. There are many characteristics shared by the two shaft burials. Both contain
successive layers of burials, although only the Bentsen-Clark site appears to have contained
secondary re-burials. The figures from Kaufman show many bones missing, but presumably
this has resulted from poor conditions of bone preservation. The artifacts are of contrasting
styles, but the elements present in both situations are not dissimilar.
The mortuary activity at Sam Kaufman is treated as the product of a single burial event
(Skinner, Harris, and Anderson, 1969: 26-36). The writers attribute the layering to status
distinction within a single social group. The layers of burials at Bentsen-Clark probably
represent a sequence of mortuary activity perhaps spread over several years (G. Perino,
personal communication). This interpretation is based on the fact that the walls of the pit
had slumped over the lower burial layers, and possibly indicates a lengthy history for burial
activity at the site.
Despite the possible differences in length of activity at the two sites and the fact that
fewer people were buried at Kaufman (four individuals in the multiple burial, eleven in the
shaft), the rules limiting access to this locus of final interment appear to be quite similar for
both. In the shaft grave at Kaufman were found one adolescent, one sub-adult male, six
other adult males and three adult females. Here the association with kinds and types of
burial goods is known, and the males received the majority of attention both in terms of
variety and the amount of wealth invested in burial accoutrements (Skinner, Harris, and
Anderson, 1969:35). The Bentsen-Clark association of membership with old adults does not
pertain here, but this may be an artifact of small sample size. That the attainment of adult
male status was a factor strongly favoring access to shaft burial is evident in both the
Kaufman and the Bentsen-Clark shaft graves.
The "multiple" shallow pit burial at Kaufman presents an interesting contrast to the
shaft burials. Here four females were buried in a single large pit and disposed in a manner
similar to the shaft burials. Females here were buried in two layers and show artifact
assemblages more varied and extensive than those of females in the shaft. One might suggest
that the two situations at Kaufman reflect complementary facets of a complex burial
program. In one case, membership is dependent upon a male-oriented status system and
perhaps the presence of females and young individuals was by association with the high
ranking males. Females of high status were buried in a spatially distinct situation with
accoutrements strongly resembling those afforded high status males.

86

~THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITEâ, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS
SKELETAL MORPHOLOGY

Metric Observations
The fragmentary nature of the Bentsen-Clark series strongly limited the number of
descriptive measures which could be taken. In addition, measurements of the crania were
further limited by the effects of pre- and post-mortem deformation (cradle-boarding and
warpage). Since no more than a few suspect examples of a very limited list of measurelnents
could be taken on the skulls cranial measurements will not be reported here.
Excellent preservation of the dentitions, however, did allow accurate measurements of
maximum dimensions. The raw data are presented here as Tables 8 through 11. These data
should be useful for further population comparisons. Since many multi-variate techniques
require raw data input, all data are presented here rather than only smnmary statistics.
A few measurements could be taken upon a minority of the post-cranial parts.
Maximum lengths of the humeri and femora are presented below in Table 4. Statures
computed from each bone according to Trotter and Gleserâs regression formulae (1958:
120) for Mongoloid males are also listed.
These measurements, as well as maximum femur head diameter (cf. Fig. 1), closely
resemble those reported for Kaufman series (Butler, in Skinner, Harris, and Anderson 1969:
134). The Bentsen-Clark group appears to be slightly longer-limbed and hence taller than the
small sample from KautMaan. The Kaufman series show discontinuous ranges for male and
female maximum femur head dimensions. These ranges closely resemble the two modalities
in the Bentsen-Clark modes also separate at 42 ram., although the ranges are slightly more
extensive. These data emphasize the morphologic similarity of the two series and support
the above statements concerning an uneven sex ratio at Bentsen-Clark. The slight increase in
ranges should not be disturbing since the Bentsen-Clark sample size is over three times that
of the Kaufinan series.
Artificial Cranial Deformation
Butler reports the presence of fronto-occipital deformation in the Kaufman series (in
Skinner, Harris, and Anderson, 1969 : 129-131 ). The fragmentary nature of both series has
limited observation to a minority of individuals. With two possible exceptions (one male,
one female), all crania from Bentsen-Clark show evidence of artificial deformation. The
presence of simple occipital deformation (cf. Neumann, 1942) is obvious in many
individuals, with the most extreme examples all being inale. Post-mortem warpage and
fragmentation makes accurate observations difficult; however, the frontal bones do not
appear to show flattening characteristics of fronto-occipital deformation. There is one
exception, but even this case could be the product of post-mortem warpage. None of the
frontals are deformed to the extent figured by Butler for the Kaufman series.
Non-metric Variants
Table 5 summarizes the information derived from study of the non-metric or discrete
traits. Although it would be desirable to report this data by individual and identify the age,
sex, and degree of cranial deformation, rather than simply indicating frequencies by side,
the ossuary situation precludes this. Traits which could be observed in no more than three
individuals are not reported.
A comparison of the Bentsen-Clark non-metric trait frequencies with those listed by
Butler for Kaufman site (Butler, in Skinner, Harris and Anderson, 1969:118-125)discloses

APPENDIX

87

no marked differences between the two series. Nearly identical frequencies are found for the
following traits: lambdoid wormians, ossicte at lambda, supraorbital notch, metipic suture,
superior sagittal sinus flexes left, and the mylo-hyoid arch. The Bentsen-Clark series shows
relatively more supra-orbital foramina, auditory exostoses, divided hypoglossal canals,
double mental foramina, and fewer septal apertures and tympanic dihiscences than the
Kaufman series.
Despite the fact that several characters do show differences in frequencies this may not
reflect any real genetic dissimilarity for the two groups. The small sample sizes effectively
limit the strength of these differences, as does a disparity in age and sex distribution for the
observable bony material. The Kaufman series is both younger and contains fewer complete
male skeletons than the Bentsen-Clark population. The age factor could easily explain the
differences in frequencies for traits which are known to be age regressive (cf. Korey, 1970;
Buikstra, 1972 and unpublished ms.), such as the supra-orbital foramina and the tympanic
dihisence. The Kaufman decreased frequency of auditory exostoses and increased number of
septal apertures is probably related to the association of the former trait with males and
latter with females (cf. Tanzer, 1960; Hrdlicka, t935). In fact, only the small number of
multiple mental foramina for the Kaufman series seems unusual, given the other factors
which could affect trait distribution. In sum, the data derived from the study of non-metric
variants emphasizes genetic homogeneity and common morphology for the two series. There
is no indication that these two groups come from significantly different gene pools.
Dental Morphology
The following dental features were observed according to the standards established by
Albert A. Dahlberg and his co-workers at the Zollar Laboratory of Dental Anthropology of
the University of Chicago: maxillary incisor shovelling, Carabelliâs cusp, protostylid, number
of roots in mandibular molars, maxillary and mandibular molar cusp patterns, and buccal
enamel extensions in the molar teeth. These data are summarized here in Tables 6 and 7.
In addition to these variations, enamel pearls were noted in five instances - twice in the
lower dentition of a single individual, and in three distinct upper arcades. The bilateral
pearls occur lingually between the (two) roots of the third molars. Two of the pearls found
in the maxillary dentitions also appear on third molars. The other occurrence is on a left
M2. In all the upper molars, the pearls are located between the lingual and the disto-buccat
roots.
Two mandibles show one supernumerary tooth on the right side. One of these is a
second lateral incisor; the other a peg-shaped tooth located between, and lingual to the
pre-molars. The latter supernumerary is a structure completely separate from the
surrounding teeth. It resembles a pre-molar in its morphology although the crown in slightly
smaller than other premolars in this jaw (maximum crown dimensions are 6.6 x 7. 1 mm.).
The lateral incisor is fused to, or had never separated from the more medial, normal lateral
incisor. The tooth is slightly smaller than the other laterals, but it is otherwise complete and
normal in appearance. In contrast to the supernumerary premolar, this tooth was functional
in ordinary occlusion.
It is difficult to compare the dental morphology of the Bentsen-Clark series to that of
the Kaufman population. The Kaufman sample reported by Butler (in Skinner, Harris, and
Anderson, 1969: 125-129) is much smaller than the Bentsen-Clark group. The situation is
further complicated by the fact that Butler does not always report the total number of teeth
observed and instead merely reports the absolute number of individuals showing a particular

88

THE BENTSEN-CLARK SITE, RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS

variant. The two groups apparently have relatively similar frequencies of incisor shovelling
and cusp patterns in the upper and !ower first molars and the lower M 1 s. The upper second
molars of the Kaufman series appear to have larger hypocones than those from
Bentsen-Clark teeth; however this is a judgm.ent difficult to standardize between observers.
The small sample of Kaufman M2s and M3s eliminates the possibility of comparing
structures in the more variable of the lower molar teeth. There are definitely more
protostylid pits in the Kaufman series; however, the frequency of full cusp expression is
comparable.
In sum, the small size of the Kaufman sample prevents the use of dental morphology
for expensive epigenetic comparison. However, there does appear to be enough variation
apparent to make this a useful source of information [âor further comparisons of
Bentsen-Clark to series more extensive than the Kaufman population.
Pathology
The fragmentary nature of the Bentsen-Clark series makes an extensive study of
pathology impossible. Several of the fragmentary long bones show extensive superficial
remodelling. The childâs skeleton shows much resorption near the ends of the diaphyses.
One (right) rib had been broken near the angle and had healed completely before the
individual died. Two cranial fragments show small circular lesions which must have been
secondary to a primary soft tissue infection. One of these is in the right orbit, directly under
the area where the lacrimal sac would have been in life. The other is an extreme
development of the fossa for the left submandibular gland.
Table 12 summarizes data concerning pre-mortem tooth loss and caries rate for the total
series. The mandibular dentition shows the most extensive changes due to both kinds of
pathology. The molar teeth are most heavily affected. Of the 17 maxillary arcades studied
(160 teeth intact), two showed pre-mortem tooth loss, six individuals had one case of caries,
and three had four caries. The 26 lower arcades contained a total of 225 teeth. Six of the
mandibles had lost only one tooth prior to death. Two had lost two teeth and one individual
had lost five. Seven mandibles contained only one carious tooth; eleven had two or more
caries with five being the maximum number per mandible. The total caries rate was 12.6%,
which is slightly lower than the 16.2% reported by Butler (p. 129) for the Kaufman series.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The skeletons recovered from the Bentsen-Clark site comprise a series of a minimum of
five sub-adults, 26 adults, and one child between six and ten years of biological age.
Approximately ten adults are relatively young, ten middle-aged, and six old. Subjective
observations and measurements of dimorphism indicate that there are more males than
females in the series, although the exact number of each cannot be determined. Combining
the data for age and sex, we find that preferential access to this particular form of burial was
given to old adult males. Males received special access to a similar burial form at Kaufman
site, another Caddoan occupation site from the same region, although age was not a decisive
element there.
The bones present in the Bentsen-Clark series appear to have been selected upon the
basis of size. Presumably this reflects procedures followed during the Caddoan burial
program. However, it is also possible that historic activity by the Red River and artifact
collectors also affected the nonrandom representation of body parts.

APPENDIX

89

Extensive fragmentation, post-morten warpage, and the presence of artificial cranial deformation (simple occipital and perhaps fronto-occipital) limited the number of epigenetic
observations which could be taken upon the series. Cranial observations are restricted to
dental measurements and morphological observations, as well as the determination of trait
frequencies for non-metric variants of the skull. Maximum length measurements for the few
intact long bones were used to calculate estimates of stature. In all cases, a comparison of
the Bentsen-Clark data with those derived from Kaufman emphasizes a basic similarity for
the two series. The Bentsen-Clark individuals are slightly taller than those from Kaufman
and they have fewer multiple mental foramina. Other than these minor differences, the two
populations closely resemble each other morphologically and were therefore probably
derived from similar gene pools. The numerous denta! observations taken from the
Bentsen-Clark series should be useful for further biological distance comparisons with other
series.
The fragmentary nature of the series also restricted the number of observations which
could be made concerning patho!ogy. Periosteal remodelling on long bones, one broken rib,
two cranial lesions secondary to soft tissue (glandular?)infections, and a caries rate slightly
lower than that for Kaufman site are readily observable, but this could not represent the
total pathology profile for the population.
