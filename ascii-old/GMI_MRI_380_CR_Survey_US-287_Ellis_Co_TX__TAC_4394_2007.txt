ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance, pedestrian, and cut bank survey of new and existing rightof-way along US 287 from Business US 287 to south of SH 34 in Ellis County, Texas. The
project area is 2.8-miles long and the right-of-way varies in width between 300 and 680 feet on
either side of US 287. A total of 22 acres of new additional right-of-way were required for this
project. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to determine the
presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their
eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being conducted
under the Civil Associates, Dallas Evergreen contract in which Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI project
number 30561.00.02) is a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the pedestrian survey was undertaken in
January 2007, by Geo-Marine, Inc.
Large portions of the proposed project area were heavily disturbed by previous road construction,
utility and pipeline placement dumping, erosion and erosion control measures. No significant
cultural deposits were identified during the current survey. As a result of these investigations, it
is recommended that the proposed widening and alterations of US 287 will have no effect on
archeological historic properties and that no further work is required. Notes, forms, files,
photographs, and other materials from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconnaissance, pedestrian, and cut bank survey of existing and new rightof-way (ROW) along a 2.8 mile segment of US 287 in Ellis County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effects (APE) along the ROW varies in width between 300 and 680 feet on either side
of US 287. The highway project required an additional 22 acres of new ROW. The purpose of
the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to determine the presence/absence of
archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the
Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being conducted in compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas under Antiquities Permit Number 4394. This work is being conducted under the
Civil Associates, Dallas Evergreen contract in which Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), is a subcontractor.
The pedestrian survey fieldwork was undertaken in January 2007 by Tiffany Osburn of GMI,
who served also served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The APE extends along US 287 from Business 287 to south of SH 34 in an upland setting
(Figures 1 and 2). The APE varies between 300 and 680 ft in width on either side of US 287 and
consists of existing ROW and new proposed ROW. The proposed project would convert the
existing two-lane, undivided, rural, roadway with grass-lined ditches into a four-lane, divided,
urban, grade-separated, concrete-paved roadway. Intersections would be grade-separated. The
main lanes are designed to be depressed vertically underneath Lampasas St., and frontage roads
are being proposed between Lampasas and SH 34. This will involve the construction of
additional bridges over Mustang Creek and Business 287 southbound, a tributary of Mustang
Creek, and over SH 34. The deepest column depths for the bridges at Mustang Creek and its
tributary are 35 to 40 ft. The vertical disturbance in the vicinity of Lampasas will be
approximately 25 to 30 ft, as the highway will be depressed here so that a Lampasas bridge can
cross above it. Where the highway construction will remain approximately at grade, the vertical
impact will be between three and five feet in depth.
The APE is primarily within an upland environment; two small drainages, Mustang Creek and a
Mustang Creek tributary cross the APE. Large portions of the APE were heavily disturbed by
previous road construction, utility lines, pipelines, erosion, and erosion control measures along
US 287.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Ellis County is within the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate zone
between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. The vegetation within the project area is predominantly grassland with
scattered clusters of trees, with the greatest concentration of trees being found along the
drainages. Grasses expected to occur within this area include: little bluestem, big bluestem,
Indiangrass, hairgrama switchgrass, Florida paspalum, eastern gramagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem, meadow dropseed, vine-mesquite, and
buffalograss (Coffee et al. 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone
changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of
wildlife, which previously inhabited the area, include bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark,
field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al.
1980:50).
The region has a warm, temperate, humid subtropical climate that is generally mild, with periods
of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly
distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in August.
Much of the rainfall occurs in heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff allowing only limited
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 2.5 cm (1 in) falling
per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds are
southerly. Temperatures remain above 32Â° F approximately 240 days each year (Orton 1969).
The proposed project area along US 287 is underlain by the upper Cretaceous Wolf City Sand
Formation. The Wolf City Sand Formation consists primarily of marl, sand, sandstone, and
mudstone. Generally in Ellis County it is consists of an upper fine-grained sand and silt unit,
calcareous, medium yellowish gray; and a lower mudstone unit, calcareous, dark gray, weathers
medium gray. Marine mega-fossils are found throughout (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988).
The proposed project area consists of six soil map units within the Wilson-Crockett association:
Burleson clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes; Wilson clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Houston clay, 5 to 8
percent slopes, eroded; Houston-Sumter complex, 5 to 8 percent slopes, severely eroded; Trinity
clay, occasionally flooded; and Trinity clay frequently flooded. The soils are all generally
characterized as gently sloping grayland and blackland soils in upland and eroded upland settings
(Brooks et al. 1961).
4

Burleson series soils, and particularly the Burleson clays are deep, nearly level to moderately
sloping clays found on uplands and on old alluvial terraces. This profile consists of a dark gray
clay A horizon about 50 inches thick that is underlain by a thick clayey marl. The upper 12
inches forms a crusty surface layer that is blocky and cracks when dry. The subsoil is dark-gray
to olive-gray dense clay that is massive and absorbs water very slowly (Brooks et al. 1961:11).
Houston series soils are dark olive-gray, deep heavy clays. These soils are gently sloping to
sloping and generally are eroded. They have a well-drained surface layer and are productive.
Their subsoil is fine textured and takes in water slowly. They are rich in lime. The typical profile
consists of a dark olive-gray or olive-gray surface layer about 9 inches thick followed by 24
inches of heavy clay subsoil with a blocky structure. Below this the parent material is olive clay
or clayey marl that is somewhat mottled with yellow. It has weak, blocky structure that grades to
massive. These soils are thinnest in the more sloping areas (Brooks et al. 1961:16).
The Wilson series soils, and the Wilson clay loam (1 to 3 percent slopes) in particular, are gently
sloping clay loams that are suited to cultivated crops. The dark gray soil is about 70 inches thick
with a weak blocky to massive structure and is underlain by clayey marl. This marl parent
material contains many concretions of iron and calcium carbonate (Brooks et al. 1961:25).
The Trinity series, including the Trinity clay, occasionally flooded, and the Trinity clay,
frequently flooded, are deep heavy clays along the floodplain of streams. These soils are nearly
level and have slow surface drainage. They consist of a dark gray surface layer that is about 30
inches thick. It is has moderate, fine, blocky to granular structure and cracks when it dries.
Below, the very dark gray heavy clay subsoil is 50 inches thick. It has blocky structure and also
cracks when dry. The parent material for this soil series is a calcareous alluvium that washed
mainly from the Blackland prairie (Brooks et al. 1961:24).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Three major reports concerning the archeology of the Upper Trinity River Basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the Upper Trinity River drainage and the culture-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988), much of the excavation efforts within the
Upper Trinity River Basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork
(Brown and Lebo 1991; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Lebo 1995a, 1995b; Lebo and
Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the East Fork (Dawson and
Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations
by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also
reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988;
Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al.
1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the
adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Reservoir studies along the East Fork have included work at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard.
Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949 with test excavations being conducted at the Campbell Hole
(41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949). Additional excavations
conducted at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focus â a Late
Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits
(often), and trade pottery from cultures to both the east and west (Stephenson 1952). In 1964, the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project conducted an inventory survey of a planned enlargement of
Lake Lavon (Lorrain 1965). Later, excavations were carried out by Southern Methodist
University (SMU) at selected sites found during the survey (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott
1975). Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed with the help of Dallas Archeological Society (DAS)
members in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963); excavations were carried out subsequently at the Glen
Hill (41RW4) and Upper Rockwall (41RW2) sites (Ross 1966), and the Lower Rockwall site
(41RW1) (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work was concentrated on excavations at
âWylie focus pitâ sites in an effort to better understand the function of these large depressions.

Investigations at Bardwell Lake began in 1963, with a survey of the proposed reservoir being
undertaken by the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project (TASP). As a result of this project 15
sites were discovered, five of which were recommended for additional work (Shafer 1964). In
1965, backhoe investigations were done by TASP at six sites in Bardwell Lake; based on the
results of these investigations, further efforts were undertaken at the Pecan Springs site (41EL11).
The investigation identified vertically separated Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations,
which included three burials and many other features (Sorrow 1966). In 1980 a survey for a fivemile pipeline was conducted for the Ellis County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1.
As a result of this survey, a lithic scatter and four concentrations of historic artifacts were
identified. The lithic scatter and one of the historic areas appear to consist of redeposited
artifacts, while the other historic areas were interpreted as dumps (Skinner and Baird 1980).
In addition to Bardwell Lake, two other major reservoir studies have been undertaken in this area
along the Upper Trinity River: Richland Creek Lake and Joe Pool Lake. The RichlandChambers Reservoir was originally included in the proposed Tennessee Colony Reservoir
(Chamberlin 1972; Richner 1982; Richner and Bagot 1978; Richner and Lee 1976, 1977), but this
development was later canceled. Later, dams were planned on both Richland and Tehuacana
creeks, and a preliminary overview of the cultural resources was prepared (Burton and Connors
1979). Finally, the project was reduced to the Richland Creek impoundment and became known
as the Richland Creek Reservoir. Fieldwork for the project was undertaken by SMU, beginning
with a survey fo the project area in 1980 during which 911 sites were discovered. During the
final phase of this project 15 prehistoric sites and 38 historic sites were mitigated during four field
seasons from June 1982 to December 1984 (Bruseth and Martin, eds. 1987; Bruseth and Moir
1987; Jurney and Moir 1987; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Moir and Jurney 1987).
Fieldwork on Joe Pool Lake began in 1977 with a survey that recorded 42 sites within the project
area, including Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic era sites (Skinner and Connors 1979).
Mitigation effors were conducted from 1984 to 1986 at six prehistoric and 13 historic sites.
Recent cultural resources management investigations in Ellis County have been limited in both
number and scope. Investigations in Ellis County have included the Chambers creek Ellis,
Navarro, and Johnson counties (Cole 1978, 1981a, 1981b; Ferring 1975; Nunley 1983; Warren
1975) for the Soil Conservation Service, and the Trintiy River Project (Richner and Bagot 1978)
for the Corps of Engineers. Cultural resources investigations were also undertaken as a part of
the Superconducting Super Collider project. This project is entirely within Ellis County and
forms a large ring around the town of Waxahachie. During the initial survey, which included
about 90 percent of the total area, 77 sites (13 prehistoric, 62 historic, and two mixed
prehistoric/historic) were recorded (Jurney et al. 1990). A 2005 survey by Parsons, Brinkerhoff,
Quade, & Douglas, Inc., involved 100 percent pedestrian survey of the US 287 bypass (Ahr
2005). The project area included the existing ROW for the current proposed project. No cultural
resources were identified during this survey.
A review of the site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was conducted to
examine the records of known sites within a mile of the project area. Although a previous
archeological survey has been conducted along the corridor, no recorded archeological sites fall
within the project corridor. Only one site, 41EL183, is located within a mile of the project area
(.92 miles to the northwest of the northern end of the corridor). This site was recorded during
archeological investigations in support of the Superconducting Super Collider project in Ellis
County. The site consisted of several flaked stone artifacts within a borrow area used for the
7

construction of US 287âs crossing of Mustang Creek. Nine shovel tests at the site yielded no
cultural material and no additional work was recommended (Yedlowski et al. 1998:175, 310). A
review of historic maps of the area, as well early road and soils maps, did not yield the location of
any historic sites within the project area.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Investigations at
Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the
chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a
chronological sequence of six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
Upper Trinity River Basin. The generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state
of knowledge as interpreted from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the
adaptations associated with these periods is presented below.

The Paleo-Indian occupation of the Upper Trinity River Basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the best
known Paleo-Indian site within the region. While the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000 B.P.)
contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the
controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally
occurring lignite as either a fuel in these hearths or an inadvertent inclusion contaminated the
radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000-10,000 B.P. for Clovisperiod occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of North
Central Texas. Our knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early
occupants is extremely limited. However, excavation at the Aubrey site, a well-preserved Clovisperiod site in Denton County, has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game
8

animals alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species were used (Ferring 1989).
Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis
adaptations in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now extinct, big game species is more
characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
Our knowledge of the Archaic period in the Upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of
data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods.
Recent investigations along the West Fork (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986)
indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried
within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces, but they
are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period
(Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon
materials from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer
recognized as being acceptable for North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987;
Yates and Ferring 1986).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts indicate that
the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters
and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time period and then moved to another
locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer and
numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits
associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and
Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this
time period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their
excellent documentation.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River Basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase. The early phase is characterized
by sand and grog tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern Plains
influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of
horticulture and the procurement of bison also appear in sites of this period (Harris and Harris
1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikrylâs (1987) recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period
largely follows that of Lynott (1977).
Investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in
a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a middle
phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the
region before this time.

9

Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent
analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in northeastern
Dallas County also suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years
old. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155-1275, while a
carbon isotope ratio of â17.7% suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major
part of her diet (Peter and Clow 1999). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a
small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in
Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity
River) yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by radiocarbon dating of bone collagen
to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads
and a shell gorget were present; and a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 percent suggests that the
groupâs diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the
Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture
was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that
divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by groups in the Dallas area.
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period
in the Upper Trinity River Basin. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have
traversed the area. However, exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are
almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited
number of sites, no protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of
the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. A lack of
documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has
contributed to this situation.

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands to the north and east of North Central Texas. Delaware,
Chickasaw, Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in North Central Texas.
Skirmishes and raids were frequent in the 1830s, and it was not until 1843 that Sam Houston,
President of the Republic of Texas, met with the Indian tribes at the abandoned Birdâs Fort in
nearby Tarrant County and signed a peace treaty. Captain Jonathan Bird and a small group of
settlers had attempted to establish the first Anglo-American settlement in the area in 1840;
however, the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Apparently the lack of supplies and the
difficulty of communicating with the settlements in Northeast Texas contributed to this
abandonment. However, by 1845 the influx of settlers, enticed by commercial land development
enterprises such as the Petersâ Colony, resulted in the movement of the frontier farther west.
By 1849 the Texas Legislature had created Ellis County from Navarro County and named it after
Richard Ellis, President of the Congress which had declared Texas independent of Mexico.
Waxahachie, the county seat of Ellis County, was organized in 1861, making it the oldest town in
the county. By 1850 the city of Dallas had become the county seat of Dallas County and was
developing into a mercantile center because of its position on the Trinity River. Population and
commercial growth continued in Dallas into the 1860s when the Civil War had a dramatic effect
on both the population and their business enterprises. By the mid-1870s, however, Dallas had
become a major distribution center for buffalo hides and a marketing center for cotton (Reese et
10

al. 1986:164). Cotton farming became the major agricultural activity within the rich Blackland
Prairie. As was common in areas dependent on cotton, tenant farming was a major social
institution. The economy of the area was largely dependent upon agriculture until the turn-of-thecentury when the railroad and the discovery of oil significantly affected the economy and market
accessibility of the area. Although the area surrounding Lake Lavon and Bardwell Lake remain
rural in character, the rapid growth of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is slowly encroaching
upon them.

METHODS

The Texas Archeological Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us), a database of recorded archeological
sites in the state, was consulted prior to conducting the reconnaissance survey of US 287 to
provide a measure of the potential for archeological resources within the corridor. Examination
of the records focused on identifying known archeological sites within a mile of the project area.
One previously recorded site (41EL183), a lithic scatter, was mapped within a 1-mile radius of
the APE. The site does not fall within the current APE and is discussed in the previous research
section of this report.
The project area was surveyed traveling in both directions along US 287 using a combination of
windshield and pedestrian survey. The survey began by driving the length of the APE to assess
the condition of the existing and new proposed ROW as well as the two drainage crossings. The
condition of the APE and drainage crossings was documented with digital photographs. During
pedestrian survey surface inspection was conducted in the existing and proposed ROW in the
APE. The cut bank survey was conducted at all drainage crossings as they were encountered
during the pedestrian survey. No cultural material was observed during the surface inspection or
cut bank survey.
Shovel testing was conducted within several segments of the new proposed ROW. In most areas
of the existing and proposed ROW shovel testing was not conducted due to adequate surface
visibility or apparent disturbance. The likelihood of cultural deposits in this upland setting with
few drainages was considered minimal. The Mustang Creek drainage within the APE is entirely
artificial and was, therefore, only documented photographically. The tributary of Mustang Creek
has banks that are approximately four feet deep. One profile of the cut bank was shovel scraped
to determine the presence of buried soils or archeological deposits.
Shovel tests, approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter, were used to characterize the
sediments and prospect for potential archeological deposits. The shovel tests were excavated to
either the top of the B-horizon or to a depth of 80 cm below surface (bs), whichever came first.
Shovel tests were excavated by arbitrary 20-cm levels while also accounting for observed soil
stratigraphy. Thus, depths below ground surface for each arbitrary level are consistent
throughout all areas. When a stratigraphic change occurred within an arbitrary 20-cm level, each
stratum was screened separately. General descriptions of soil texture, color using Munsell color
12

notations, and depth were recorded for all shovel tests. Sediments excavated from shovel tests
were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm; 0.25 inch) hardware cloth and examined for cultural
materials; then excavations were promptly backfilled.
Agricultural practices and construction have disturbed much of the APE. The disturbances in the
more developed portions of the APE consisted of the Ennis Regional Medical Center (under
construction), the Ennis Sixth Grade Center, Blue Bonnet City Park, landscaping, driveways,
culverts, bridges, erosional gullies draining into the creeks, and erosion control measures along
the side of the road, particularly near drainages. Other disturbances in the less developed portions
of the ROW consisted primarily of plowing and terracing of farmland, push piles, some road
construction, culverts, driveways, and erosion.
Only one structure of historic age was identified within 150 of the APE for archeological
resources (see Thomas 2007). Digital photographs were taken to illustrate the conditions of the
project area. No cultural material was recovered. All notes, forms, and photographs will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

An archeological reconnaissance pedestrian survey was conducted along US 287 in January 2007
by Geo-Marine, Inc. Twenty-two acres of additional ROW are required for the proposed project,
which consists of the widening of US 287 from Business 287 to south of SH 34, within the
corporate boundaries of the City of Ennis. The proposed project would convert the existing twolane, undivided, rural, roadway with grass-lined ditches into a four-lane, divided, urban, gradeseparated, concrete-paved roadway. Intersections would be grade-separated. The main lanes are
designed to be depressed vertically underneath Lampasas St., and frontage roads are being
proposed between Lampasas and SH 34. This will involve the construction of additional bridges
over Mustang Creek and Business 287 southbound, a tributary of Mustang Creek, and over SH
34. The deepest column depths for the bridges at Mustang Creek and its tributary are 35 to 40 ft.
The vertical disturbance in the vicinity of Lampasas will be approximately 25 to 30 ft, as the
highway will be depressed here so that a Lampasas bridge can cross above it. Where the highway
construction will remain approximately at grade, the vertical impact will be between three and
five feet in depth.
The APE is situated in an area of uplands interrupted only by the crossing of Mustang Creek and
its tributary above Bardwell Lake. Much of this area east of the City of Ennis is still rural farm
and pasture land, though development is taking place along the east side of US 287. The
undeveloped land adjacent to the ROW consists of fallow fields, pastures, and wooded areas.
Surface visibility within the existing ROW was generally good. In portions of the larger
northernmost section of new proposed ROW, however, visibility was relatively poor. Eight
shovel tests were excavated in select areas to determine the potential for archeological resources
within the APE (see Figure 2). Four shovel tests were excavated along the northbound side of US
287; and four shovel tests were excavated along the southbound side of US 287. In addition, the
cut bank of the tributary of Mustang Creek was profiled to determine the presence of buried soils
or archeological deposits.
From the northern end of the corridor, the APE begins at the intersection of US 287 with Business
US 287. This interchange is also the location of Mustang Creek; three bridges cross over the
creek in this area. This northern end of the project corridor is the most artificially sculptured
portion of the survey area. Mustang Creek, below this interchange, has been channelized entirely
into a ditch in one area and a small concrete lined channel in another area (Figure 3). Figure 4

shows Mustang Creek at the western edge of the ROW. Due to the substantially altered
topography near Mustang Creek it is unlikely that intact archeological deposits remain; no
subsurface testing was conducted in this area.
From the northern end of the project corridor along the northbound side of US 287 the APE
remains within the existing ROW to south of the tributary of Mustang Creek. In the area north of
the tributary the ROW is sculpted and impacted by the original construction of US 287 and the
bridge over Ennis Parkway (Figures 5 and 6).

the corridor

Figure 5. Photograph is taken from bridge over Ennis Parkway looking toward the northern end of the corridor. The
bridge on the left is the US 287 bridge over Mustang Creek and Business US 287 southbound.

The APE in the area of the tributary of Mustang Creek is obviously impacted by the original
construction of US 287 on both the southbound and northbound sides (Figures 7 and 8). The land
on either side of the creek has been built up along the highway; terracing and a ditch were also
constructed to control run off within the ROW. These activities have all impacted the natural
drainage of this tributary. Along the eastern boundary of the ROW, however, there appears to be
less substantial land alteration. In this location there is little difference in topographic relief
between the surface of the existing ROW and the natural surface outside the ROW (see Figure 8).
A profile of the cut bank was, therefore, exposed to determine the presence of buried soils and the
potential for archeological deposits (Figure 9). No buried soils were observed and no cultural
materials were observed in the profile or during a thorough inspection of the cutbank within the
ROW. Within the shovel scraped profile, the upper 40 cm of sediment were mixed, obviously the
result of construction efforts. These mixed sediments included a variety of mottled textures,
particularly clay and silty loam with colors ranging from 7.5YR 4/4 to 2.5Y 5/4. From 40 to
102 cm bs the sediment is silty clay (10YR 3/1) followed by 50 cm of sand (2.5YR 4/3).

The larger of the two new proposed sections of ROW begins just to the south of the tributary of
Mustang Creek. This section of additional ROW extends along both sides of US 287 to the
intersection of SH 34. On the northbound side of US 287, the new proposed ROW includes a
narrow segment of fenced pasture land north of the Ennis Sixth Grade Center and graded,
terraced ground in front of the Ennis Sixth Grade Center. The pasture land appears to be
disturbed by gulley erosion or ditching as well as a water pipeline (Figures 10 and 11). The lack
of grassy vegetation as well as the ditches and gulleys in this area provided adequate surface
visibility. No cultural materials were observed on the surface in this upland area of new proposed
ROW. Nonetheless, a shovel test was conducted in this location to characterize the sediments
and to prospect for archeological deposits (Figure 12). This shovel test revealed sediments that
were only minimally impacted by agriculture or construction activities. The upper 10 cm showed
mixing of silt and clay (10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/4) sediments followed by a sharp contact with silty
clay (10YR 3/2) that extended to 60 cm bs before grading into a silty clay (10YR4/1) that
continued to the base of the test at 82 cm bs. No cultural materials were observed in this shovel
test.
The new proposed ROW in front of the Ennis Sixth Grade Center, north of Lampasas St. on the
northbound side of US 287, is terraced and has apparently been scraped below grade (Figure 13).
One shovel test was placed along the eastern boundary of the new proposed ROW in this area
north of the Ennis Sixth Grade Center. This test encountered silty clay (10YR3/2) that extended
from the surface to 50 cm bs before grading into a somewhat lighter in color, sterile, silty clay
(10YR4/1). No cultural materials were identified during excavation.

South of Lampasas St., on the northbound side of US 287, the new proposed ROW includes land
being used for the construction of the Ennis Regional Medical Center (Figure 14). Here, the new
proposed ROW passes through the fenced construction area and is currently being used for fill
dirt, construction materials stockpiling, and erosion fencing. South of the Ennis Regional
Medical Center on the northbound side of US 287, the proposed ROW includes a narrow segment
of unfenced secondary growth wooded land and fenced upland pasture that extends south to the
Exxon gas station on the northeast corner of US 287 and SH 34 (Figures 15 and 16).
One shovel test was excavated in the wooded land south of the Ennis Regional Medical Center
(Figure 17). The unseasonably high rainfall amounts in January resulted in a supersaturated
condition along this portion of new proposed ROW, as well as much of the project area. Much of
the ground along this stretch of existing and proposed ROW had standing water on the surface.
The shovel test was placed in a relatively dry area near the eastern boundary of the new proposed
ROW. The wet sediment was very uniform throughout, consisting of silty clay (10YR 3/1) from

65 cm bs where excavation was ceased due to saturation of the subsoil. No cultural materials
were identified during excavation of this shovel test.
An additional shovel test was excavated in the fenced pasture north of the Exxon gas station
shown in Figure 16. This shovel test consisted of 30 cm of silty clay loam (10YR 2/2) followed
by 30 cm of silty clay (10YR3/1) that graded into a lighter colored (10YR 4/1) silty clay that
extended to 80 cm bs (Figure 18). No cultural materials were observed in this shovel test.

This same new section of ROW along the southbound side of US 287 includes an upland pasture
to the north of Lampasas St. and south of the Mustang Creek tributary (Figure 19). One shovel
test was excavated in this area of pasture. The sediments encountered were similar to those
encountered north of the Ennis Sixth Grade Center along the northbound side of US 287. From
the surface to 50 cm bs the soil consisted of silty clay loam (10YR 3/2) that graded into a silty
clay (10YR 4/1) from 50 to 80 cm bs. No cultural materials were recovered.

Figure 19. Photograph shows that the new proposed ROW beyond the fence is upland pasture land.

South of Lampasas St. is a fallow, unfenced field that extends to the intersection with SH 34
(Figure 20). This land has undergone some earth moving activities that have resulted in a large
push pile as well as a linear pushed up embankment and ditch (Figure 21). One shovel test was
excavated in the grassy area south of these land alterations. This test consisted of 20 cm of mixed
fill sediments (10YR 4/3 â 2.5Y 4/4) followed by silty clay (10YR 3/1) that extended to
approximately 65 cm bs. Below 65 cm, to the termination of this unit at 80 cm bs, the sediment
was silty clay (10YR 4/1). No artifacts were encountered during excavation of this shovel test.
Further south along US 287, near the divergence of the southbound SH 34 exit ramp from US
287, an additional shovel test was excavated to prospect for cultural resources and characterize
the sediments. The upper 10 cm consisted of a mixed zone of fill dirt (10YR 4/4 â 2.5 Y 4/3);
below this, silty clay (10YR3/2) extended to 62 cm bs. From 62 cm to the termination of this
shovel test at 82 cm bs the sediment was silty clay (10YR 4/1). No cultural materials were
recovered.
The last shovel test was excavated near the corner of US 287 and SH 34 (Figure 22). The
existing ROW in this area is extensively altered by a wide ditch, culverts, and a transmission line.
The shovel test was placed within the new proposed ROW and consisted of silty clay (10YR3/1)
from the surface down to approximately 60 cm bs grading to a silty clay (10YR4/1) that extended
to the termination of the test at 80 cm. Again, no cultural materials were encountered.

The second, smaller section of new proposed ROW is on the northbound side of US 287 near the
exit ramp to SH 34. This short, narrow segment essentially straightens out a curve in the existing
ROW (Figure 23). Surface visibility within this short segment of ROW was adequate and
showed evidence of disturbance, particularly plowing and surface grading. No cultural materials
were observed in this area.

SUMMARY
The existing ROW on either side of US 287 within the project corridor has been previously
impacted by the construction of US 287. In addition, numerous buried utilities (gas, water, fiber
optic) are marked and visible within the ROW, along with aerial lines. Drainage ditches on the
north and south sides of US 287 have been sculpted and landscaped with grasses to curtail
erosion. Culverts are located along US 287 and in the ditches under roads that intersect US 287
and erosion fencing has been placed along the ditches near drainage crossings to control erosion.
Visibility within the existing ROW was generally good. In portions of the larger northernmost
section of new proposed ROW visibility was relatively poor. Eight shovel tests were, therefore,
excavated to determine the potential for archeological resources within the APE. Four shovel
tests were excavated along the northbound side of US 287; two between SH 34 and the Medical
Center (under construction), and the other two between the Ennis Six Grade Center and the
northern end of the new proposed ROW. Four shovel tests were excavated along the southbound
side of US 287; one between the northern end of the new proposed ROW and Lampasas St. and
three between Lampasas St. and SH 34.

Figure 23. Photograph shows the short, narrow segment of ROW near the southern end of the project corridor.

No cultural remains were identified in any of the shovel tests or during surface inspection of this
segment. Due to the upland location of the project area and the previous construction in the
existing ROW the project area retains little to no potential for containing any archeological
remains.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Due to the upland environment of the project area and the recent development and construction in
the APE of this 2.8 mile section of US 287, it is unlikely that the area would contain any
subsurface archeological deposits with contextual integrity. The pedestrian survey of the existing
and proposed ROW found that large sections of the APE have been adversely affected by
previous construction, excavation, erosion, erosion control, terracing, and dumping. No cultural
materials were found during the survey on the surface, in shovel tests, or in the creek banks.
No archeological historic properties were identified during the current survey. As a result of
these investigations, it is recommended that the proposed widening and alterations of US 287 will
not effect archeological historic properties and that no further work is required.
In the unlikely event that evidence of archeological deposits is encountered during construction,
work in the immediate area would immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff would be
contacted in order to initiate accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the
Programmatic Agreement (PA) between TxDOT, THC, FHWA, and the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC.
