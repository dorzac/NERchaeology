Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted an intensive archeological survey along a .3 mile
segment of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue in New Braunfels, Comal County.
This portion of the highway is planned for widening by the Texas Department of
Transportation-San Antonio District (CSJ# 0016-10-022). The survey was
conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26) and
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800), under TAC
Permit #4742. The survey took place within the existing TxDOT right-of-way
and in the 1.1 acres of new right-of-way acquired on either side of the highway.
The survey involved pedestrian inspection of the entire project area as well as
four shovel tests and four backhoe trenches. Artifacts consistent with the
known historical development of the area during the late nineteenth or early
twentieth century were observed across the project area, but investigations
determined that, in general, deposits were disturbed and lacked integrity. A
single new site was designated â Site 41CM319 â in the southwest portion of the
project area, where a partially intact brick foundation pier was found in
association with mixed late nineteenth and twentieth century artifacts near the
location of New Braunfelsâ first Colored Public School. However, deposits
associated with this site within the project area were found to be disturbed and
to lack sufficient integrity or research potential for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). Based on these findings, Hicks & Company recommends that
no additional investigation is necessary within the existing or new right-of-way
for the project to proceed to construction.
No artifact collections were made during the course of this project. All site
forms, photographs and project related records will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) â San Antonio District
proposes to improve a section of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue in New
Braunfels from Kessler Street to Hampe Street (CSJ# 0016-10-022). The
improvements would widen the existing two lane highway to four lanes. The
widening of the roadway would result in the replacement of the existing drainage
system with curb and gutter drainages, and sidewalks would be added on both
sides of the proposed roadway. The vertical profile of the roadway would be
lowered by approximately eight inches (.2 meters) to provide better clearance
under the railway structure. In addition, the existing railroad structure and
retaining walls would be removed and replaced at a height approximately one
foot above the current height (16 feet versus 14 feet, 4 inches). Existing utilities
in the project area would be adjusted for the project prior to construction.
These include gas, water, sewer, cable, Sprint, and MCI fiber-optic cable lines.
The project required the acquisition of 1.1 acres of new permanent right-of-way
and 0.33 acres of temporary easements for construction of the railroad bridge
structure.
The cultural resource investigation of the proposed road widening of Business
46-C/Seguin Avenue in New Braunfels involved an intensive linear archeological
survey within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) (Figure 1). The project area
includes all new and existing right-of-way which are publicly owned, but will not
include the easements for which right-of-entry has expired. Based on available
construction schematics/plans, the project area extends for .3 miles (482.8
meters) from Kessler Street in the west to Hampe Street in the east, with
additional right-of-way that varies between 16.4 and 45.93 feet (5-14 meters) on
each side of the existing right-of-way. The vertical extent of the APE is at least
eight inches (.2 meters) according to the available schematics, but based on
typical construction practices, may extend up to 3-4 feet (.91-1.22 meters) in
depth. The archeological survey involved a 100% pedestrian inspection of 1.1
acres of new right-of-way and the existing right-of-way, supplemented with four
shovel tests and four backhoe trenches.
The investigation exceeded the
minimum standards for archeological surveys for a project of this size as
outlined by the Texas Historical Commission in accordance with the standards
in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2).
Within the project area, the existing right-of-way is completely paved. Within
the areas of new right-of-way, extensive disturbance was found to characterize
the deposits, including disturbance resulting from the placement of subsurface
utilities, road and railroad construction, house construction and demolition. On
the western end of the project area existing structures are present and the
surface is completely paved. While artifacts dating to the late nineteenth or
early twentieth century were observed across the project area, these were
associated with deposits that lacked any integrity and were mixed with fill and
artifacts of more recent vintage. The only exception was in the portion of the
project area on the southwest side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue, northwest
of the railroad track. Within this area a single archeological feature was
encountered as well as several late nineteenth or early twentieth century
artifacts.
Subsequently, the area was designated as archeological Site
41CM319.

Introduction and Management Summary

NEWLY RECORDED SITE
Site 41CM319 encompasses three lots on the southwest side of BS 46-C
northwest of the Union Pacific railroad track. The site is a historic period site
that, based on a combination of archival and archeological research, was first
occupied during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century and has been
continuously occupied until the area was razed in anticipation of the proposed
highway construction. A single intact feature (a brick house foundation pier)
was recorded. The portions of the site located within the new right-of-way were,
however, shown to be extensively disturbed and no intact archeological deposits
that meet the criteria established for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL) were observed. The
excavations did indicate that there is a moderate probability for subsurface
features such as privies, foundations, or trash pits to be preserved in the
portions of the site west of the current project area. Any future endeavors
outside the existing or new right-of-way with the potential for subsurface
impacts should, therefore, consider subsurface testing to assess this possibility.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
The fieldwork was conducted from December 19, 2007 to December 21, 2007
under Texas Antiquities Code Permit #4742. Weather conditions were warm and
often cloudy and no problems were encountered during the course of the
fieldwork. Bradford Jones served as Principal Investigator on the project.
Bradford Jones and Matthew Stotts conducted the fieldwork with the assistance
of Rene Pickard who operated the backhoe. Kurt Korfmacher conducted
archival research on the lots encompassed within the Site 41CM319 boundaries
in January of 2008. Kevin Contrino provided GIS and graphics assistance
throughout the project. Report writing and curation of the project documents
and photos were carried out by Bradford Jones and Matthew Stotts in late
December 2007 and January 2008. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of
the requirements of TAC Permit #4742.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area lies on the border of the Blackland Prairie and
Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Gould 1960), and according to the The
Vegetation Types of Texas (McMahan et al. 1984), the vegetation type of the area
is âCropsâ. The âCropsâ vegetation type includes cultivated cover crops or row
crops providing food and/or fiber for either man or domestic animals. This
vegetation type may also portray grassland associated with crop rotations.
Vegetation of the project area does not coincide with the mapped vegetation
type. The project is located in an urban area and the land is not currently used
for agricultural purposes (Figure 2). Vegetation types found within the project
area primarily consist of urban/developed cover, consisting of a variety of native
and non-native grasses and wildflowers with scattered native or introduced trees
and shrubs that are found associated with the existing transportation right-ofÂ­
way, residences, and commercial properties.
Soils within this urban area of New Braunfels were identified as Holocene Age
fluviatile terrace deposits, developed by the activity of the Guadalupe River
during the Quaternary Period (Batte 1981). These soils generally consist of
gravel, sand, silt, and clay adjacent to the Edwards Plateau and are above flood
level. Most rivers in this area do not have active floodplains. The only mapped
soil type encountered within the project area is Krum clay (KrA), on 0-1% slopes.
This deep, well drained soil occupies nearly level stream terraces and valley fills.
A typical profile of Krum clay consists of 19 inches (48 centimeters) of dark
brown clay overlying brown clay to 49 inches (125 centimeters), yellowish brown
clay to 69 inches (175 centimeters), and yellowish brown clay to a depth of 80
inches (203 centimeters). This soil type coincides with the undisturbed natural
sediment deposits observed in shovel test and backhoe trenches excavated
within the project area.
The project area lies in an area that has been subject to heavy modification due
to prior construction. Currently the project area is located along both sides of
Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue and is crossed by the Union Pacific Railroad
(Figure 3). The areas of new right-of-way that have been acquired were
previously utilized for residential and commercial purposes. Much of the
commercial area is paved. Areas of primarily residential development retain
open ground, covered with a combination of ornamental and native grasses,
brush and trees. Most of the homes and businesses that stood on these
properties have been removed.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
The project area is located within the central Texas archeological region.
Specifically, it lies on the eastern edge of the Balcones Escarpment. Most
chronologies for central Texas are based on four main time periods, representing
roughly 12,000 years of habitation. The sequence from Collins (2004) is as
follows: Paleoindian period (ca.11,500-8,800 BP), Archaic period (ca. 8,800Â­
1,200 BP), the Late Prehistoric period (1,200-400 BP), and the Historic Period
(400 BP to present).
The 6,600-year Archaic period is typically further
subdivided into Early (8,800-6,000 BP), Middle (6,000-4,000 BP) and Late
(4,000-1,200 BP).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (11,500-8,800 BP)
Though previous theories postulate that Paleoindian peoples were highly mobile
and heavily reliant on big game hunting (Suhm et al. 1954, Hester 1980), more
current investigations have contradicted this model (Collins 2004). One reason
for this is that until recently, few Paleoindian sites within the central Texas area
had been well studied. However, work at sites such as Pavo Real near San
Antonio, Wilson-Leonard in Williamson County and the Gault Site in Bell
County have shown that Paleoindian peoples adhered to a more generalized
hunting and gathering strategy in which they might return to the same site
repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Within central Texas most Paleoindian sites are
located along the ecotonal region between the Balcones Escarpment and the
Blackland Prairie, suggesting that these campsites were intentionally situated to
exploit a variety of resources. Faunal remains collected from sites like Wilson
Leonard, Pavo Real and the Gault site support this idea. So too do lithic
artifacts and other features. Paleoindian lithic artifact types comprise a diverse
assemblage derived from biface, flake and prismatic blade technology (Collins
2004), in addition to engraved limestone, stone bolas and ochre. Projectile
points typically consist of well-made fluted lanceolate points produced from high
quality chert. A stone-paved floor found in the Kinkaid Rock Shelter attests to
an advanced degree of social organization and stability (Collins 2004).

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8,800-1,200 BP)
The Archaic spans over 9,000 years of prehistory and is typically divided into
subperiods, which reflect changes in technology, site type, and density. Lithic
technology changed radically during this time, from one reliant on prismatic
blades to one oriented more toward multidirectional core utilization. Dart points
typically became smaller and stemmed. In general it is posited that early
Archaic occupations were small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black
and McGraw 1985). Like the Paleoindian period that preceded it, the early
Archaic peopled were highly nomadic hunter-gatherers practicing a generalized
subsistence strategy. Archeologists typically believe that population density was
low during the early Archaic period, steadily increasing into the Late Archaic.
Burned Rock middens appear first in the early Archaic period. Burned rock
midden sites are considered to be characteristic of central Texas archeology
(Black 1989) of the Archaic period. These fire-cracked and discolored limestone
rock features are found in creek terrace or upland settings and have other

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

cultural materials within and around them indicating an open occupation site
(Black 1989). Burned rock middens are circular, mounded accumulations some
10-25 meters across, having a basic annular (concentric) morphology (i.e., a
dense ring or rocks surrounding a distinct center and surrounded by a thinning
periphery; Black et al. 1997). The wide variety of plant and animal remains
found within middens suggests that these ovens served as communal plant and
animal processing facilities. Ultimately, it is believed that burned rock middens
are a consequence of perhaps hundreds of cooking fires that were used and
reused in one place over many years (Black et al. 1997).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (1,200-400 BP)
The Late Prehistoric in central Texas is marked initially by the replacement of
the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow (Johnson 1995). Larger dart points
are replaced by small, thin arrow points. Typical types found in central Texas
include Scallorn and Perdiz. Biface technology appears to lose importance,
while other lithic tool types, such as unifacial end scrapers, flake tools,
alternately beveled knives, and drills occur more frequently on Late Prehistoric
sites. Despite this shift in technology, there is every indication that a broadbased hunting and gathering subsistence persisted into the Late Prehistoric
period, though groups seem to have been less mobile, frequently returning to
campsites on a seasonal basis. Pottery appears for the first time on Late
Prehistoric sites in central Texas. Central Texas pottery was typically made of
sandy paste, and tempered with bone or shell.

HISTORIC PERIOD (400 BP TO PRESENT)
The Tonkawa and Waco Indians occupied the project area at the start of the
Historic Period. Explorers recount Waco Indians camp along springs located
north of New Braunfels, and there was Tonkawa village on the Guadalupe just
above New Braunfels. Interaction between Europeans and these groups was
relatively peaceful, though threat from Comanche raiders continued into the
1850s (Greene 1996a).
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Spanish and French
expeditions commonly passed through the area that later became southeastern
Comal County. The 1691 Camino de los Tejas appears to have passed through
the immediate area through the Comal River valley, crossing the Guadalupe at
the east end of present day Nacogdoches Street. The area was noted during the
Teran de los Rios excursion in 1691, by St. Denis in 1714, the Alarcon
expedition in 1718-19 (Haas 1968, McGraw, Clark and Robbins 1998). These
references include the trips of Salinas Varona 1693, and Ramon in 1716,
establishing a firm route for the road to Nacogdoches. Spanish missionaries
established the Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Mission along the Guadalupe
River near present day New Braunfels around 1756. This mission was originally
established as the San Xavier de Horcasitas on the San Gabriel River in Milam
County. However, threats from French traders and explorers, lack of interest
among the indigenous Caddoan populations, a Smallpox epidemic, and various
other misfortunes plagued the mission community. In 1755, 41 Indians, Fray
Mariano, and Fray Ortiz moved the mission without permission from the
Spanish government to San Marcos springs in San Marcos (Bolton 1970). The
following year they again moved the site unofficially to Comal Springs on the
Guadalupe (known to us as Comal) River. The mission remained there fore less
than two years before it was abandoned permanently.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

By the mid nineteenth century the Comal Springs area had been Claimed by
Juan Martin Veramendi who also had claims to San Marcos Springs and San
Pedro Springs. Veramnedi, however, never occupied this property. Permanent
settlement of the county began in 1845 when Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels
secured title to over 1,000 acres of the Veramendi grant, including the Comal
River and Springs, for the Adesverein. Comal County was formed in March 1846
from the Eighth Precinct of Bexar County with New Braunfels as the county
seat. In the 1840s and 1850s the area around New Braunfels witnessed an
influx of both German and American settlers attracted to the rich farm and
ranch land. It is estimated that New Braunfels was the fourth largest city in
Texas in 1850. One traveler wrote in 1850 that the city âis situatedâ¦within a
beautiful and picturesque country, abounding with water power, which the
Germans have improved for establishing manufactories of various kinds.
(Rankin 1966). County population rose between 1850 and 1860 and by the eve
of the Civil War numbered over 4,000 (Greene 1996a).
German influence on the social and cultural life of Comal County endured even
with the influx of Mexican immigrants during and after the Mexican Revolution.
According to the 1890 census, 75 percent of the county population was German.
The flow of German immigrants slowed after the Civil War and by 1940 only 1.6
percent of county residents were native German. County population reached an
estimated total of 8,824 in 1920 (Greene 1996a).
Comal County grew rapidly after World War II. With approximately 16,300
residents in 1950, county population expanded by 21 percent in next decade
and reached approximately 24,000 by 1970 (Greene 1996a). In 1947 New
Braunfels incorporated eight suburbs into the city limits (Greene 1996b).
The particular project area discussed in this report is situated within a portion
of New Braunfels that was developed during the late 19th century (Lassell et. al
2007). This portion of town was settled by people of a diverse background
including African-Americans, Anglo-Americans and people of Mexican, French,
and German descent. Though of diverse backgrounds, the majority of the
inhabitants were working class citizens engaged in a variety of laboring jobs
such as laundry and well digging. A review of the Sanborn maps for New
Braunfels reveals that, prior to 1922, no structures are indicated as being
present within the project area. By 1922, fifteen structures are shown as
existing within or adjacent to the project area. Of particular interest for the
current investigation is the site of the Colored Public School situated at the
southwest corner of the intersection of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue and the
Union Pacific Railroad within the project area. Though the construction date of
the school is unknown, it is first present on 1922 Sanborn map and was
perhaps constructed around the turn of the century. The school was later
moved to a location on Hampe and Comal Streets sometime after 1927 when the
Board of Trustees of the New Braunfels ISD sold the land to Ambrosio and
Andres Rio.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to data available on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous
archeological surveys have been undertaken in or near the project APE. Nor are
any known archeological sites located within 3,280.8 feet (1,000 meters) of the
project area. The closest archeological site to the project area is Site 41CM90,

located approximately 4,740.8 feet (1445 meters) to the northwest. This
prehistoric site of indeterminate age is part of a suite of prehistoric archeological
sites situated on the banks of the Comal River.

Field Methodology

FIELD METHODOLOGY
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100% pedestrian inspection of the
project area, documenting the existing landscape and modifications that may
have impacted potential cultural resources. Based on previous research and on
site evaluation, select areas were subsurface tested to assess the potential for
intact archeological deposits.
Due to the urbanized nature of the project area, subsurface testing was
undertaken by both shovel testing (in areas with extensive existing
infrastructure) and by using a backhoe with a flat-bladed bucket to uncover
archeological remains associated with late nineteenth and early twentieth
century businesses and residences. Hand excavated shovel tests were at least
11.8 inches (30 centimeters diameter) in width and dug in 3.9 inch (10
centimeter) levels until sterile soil or impenetrable soil was encountered. Each
shovel test was recorded on a standardized shovel test form and the matrix was
screened through Â¼â hardware mesh.
Artifacts were photographically
documented in the field and reburied in the shovel test.
A backhoe was used by the investigators to scrape away long transects within
the project area to determine whether historic archeological features were
present below the surface. Trenches varied in length from 11.3 feet (3.45
meters) to 41 feet (12.5 meters) in length. Trenches were dug two bucket widths
wide, averaging approximately 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in width. In general, the
trenches were dug to approximately 3.9 inches (10 centimeters) below the last
level at which artifacts were recovered. The exceptions included Backhoe
Trenches #1 and #3, where deeper single bucket wide trenches were dug to
assess the possibility of more deeply buried cultural deposits. Samples of soil
from the trenches were screened through Â¼â hardware mesh, and examples of
the artifacts were collected and photographed. Using this method, archeologists
excavated four trenches that sampled archeological deposits on the southwest
side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue where there were less subsurface utilities
and the possibility of encountering intact early 20th century remains was the
highest. Because artifacts dating from the late nineteenth through twentieth
centuries were often observed across the project area in disturbed contexts, the
presence of intact archeological features, such as foundations piers, were
utilized as the defining criterion for registering portions of the project area as an
archeological site. All archeological features were examined, mapped using a
Trimble GPS with sub-meter accuracy, and assessed for the potential to
contribute to the larger siteâs NRHP-eligibility Site information was recorded on
standardized forms and presented to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) for inclusion in their archives and the production of one new
site trinomial.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists assessed the existing right-of-way and intensively surveyed all
portions of the proposed additional right-of-way within the project area (Figure
4). Four shovel tests and four backhoe trenches were excavated within the new
right-of-way (see below). While minor soil and fill variations were noted
throughout the project area, overall, similar conditions were recorded in the
trenches and shovel tests as well as documented on the ground surface. Within
the new right-of-way, demolition of previously existing structures, layers of fill
soil, utilities infrastructure, and landscape modification associated with the
structure, railroad and highway construction and demolition have contributed to
the severe disturbance of deposits associated with occupation of the lots.
Though artifacts ranging from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century
were observed across the project area, they were generally found to be in
disturbed contexts, not associated with intact features. One new site was
recorded, Site 41CM319, owing to the identification of a single, partially intact
brick foundation pier of uncertain age associated with artifacts dating to the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In this section an overview of the results of the pedestrian survey and associated
shovel testing and backhoe trenching is presented. For ease of discussion the
project area is broken down into four areas. Area 1 is located southeast of
Hampe Street on the northeast side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue, extending
to the railroad track. Area 2 is located on the northeast side of Business 46Â­
C/Seguin Avenue, southeast of the railroad track to Kessler Street. Area 3 is the
area on the southwest side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue, extending from
Old Nacogdoches Road to the railroad track. Finally, the area northwest of the
railroad track and extending west to Hampe Street along the southwest side of
Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue is discussed as newly recorded Site 41CM319
due to the identification of an intact foundation pier and the potential for
encountering intact features outside of the new right-of-way.

AREA 1
On the northeast side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue southeast of Hampe
Street and northwest of the railway line, Hicks & Company archeologists
documented significant disturbance within the new right-of-way. The effect of
the demolition of residential structures located within the project area was
readily visible, and consisted of piles of debris, scraped soil, and exposed fill
(Figure 5). Additionally, multiples water lines were documented along the edge
of the proposed right-of-way and extending laterally into the properties (Figure
6). This was evident by the presence of multiple manhole covers, water meters,
and a fire hydrant. In addition, marked utility lines also run within the eastern
side of the property (Figure 7).
Within the new right-of-way, occasional pieces of broken glass and ceramic as
well as demolished architectural material were visible on the surface. The
material was a mix of recent as well as older artifacts. In the cleared lot
northeast of Hampe Street, two small sherds of whiteware dishes (one decorated
with a blue floral transfer print), a milk glass canning lid liner, and a brown
glass bottle base were noted (Figure 8). The bottle base bore an âSB&G Co.â
mark, which identifies the bottle as having been manufactured by the Streator
Bottle and Glass Co. of Illinois sometime between 1881-1905 (Soda Traderz
2008). Although disturbance to the project area was clearly evident on the

surface, four shovel tests were dug in this area within the new right-of-way
(Figure 4) to test for intact deposits, owing to the presence of older artifacts on
the surface. Shovel Test #BJ1, excavated in the general area of the artifacts
described above, indicated that the deposits consisted of an upper layer of
compacted dark gray (7.5YR4/1) clay loam with 5-10 % small gravels from
which a piece of green bottle glass and two pieces of broken sewer pipe were
recovered. Below this is a layer of compact very gravelly (>70%) dark gray clay
with pieces of clear glass and rusted metal intermixed to a depth of
approximately 9.4 inches (24 centimeters). From 9.4 to 13 inches (24 to 33
centimeters) below surface another layer of pink sandy fill with black clay
mottles was encountered. A small shard of milk glass and three shards of
manganese bleached glass were recovered during the excavation of this layer.
Below this lay sterile black clay (10YR2/1) with abundant tree roots.
Shovel Tests #MS1 and #BJ2 identified further evidence of disturbance and the
presence of fill within the new right-of-way. In #MS1 two layers of very dark
gray (10YR3/1) sandy clay containing chert and limestone gravels (0-6.7
inches/0-17 centimeters below surface & 8.6-13.8 inches/22-35 centimeters
below surface) were separated by layers of limestone gravels (6.7-8.6 inches/17Â­
22 centimeters below surface & 13.8-15.7 inches/35-40 centimeters below
surface). Fragments of ceramic pipe, shingles, roofing nails, window glass, and
a small amount of lamp and bottle glass were found mixed throughout the
layers. Because of roots and the compactness of the lower layer of gravel fill,
excavation was terminated at 15.7 inches (40 centimeters) below surface. All
the layers appear to be fill or sediments redeposited as a consequence of
demolition and leveling of the site over time. In Shovel Test #BJ2, situated
adjacent to a pile of demolition debris in the new right-of-way southeast Sehaco
Street, a thin veneer of yellowish red (5YR5/6) gravel fill was found to overlay a
.8-1.2 inch (2-3 centimeter) thick deposit of gravely very dark gray (10YR3/1)
clay loam, beneath which was a very compact and ultimately impenetrable layer
of limestone gravels in a compacted sandy matrix extending at least to a depth
of 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) below the surface. Though brick fragments were
visible on the surface, no artifacts were recovered from the shovel test.
The final shovel test, #MS2, encountered a deposit of very dark gray (10YR3/1)
calcareous clay. This shovel test was excavated just northwest of the railroad
right-of-way and was the only shovel test in which the natural sediment was
encountered. No artifacts were recovered from this shovel test.

AREA 2
Southeast of the railroad, the water lines continued to be present within the new
right-of-way (Figure 9). In addition, old pavement was visible in the open area
along the southern edge of this area. In this portion of the project area, the
width of the new right-of-way is much greater, extending from the edge of the
existing right-of-way along Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue up to 145 feet (44.2
meters) to the north. Survey of the new right-of-way identified poured concrete
slab foundations and modern trash in both of the residential lots southeast of
the railroad line (Figure 10). On the eastern end of the new right-of-way the
property is occupied by an insurance company. Though Sanborn maps indicate
residential structures present here as early as 1922, during the survey of this
portion of the project area no pre-1950 artifacts were visible on the ground
surface and the existing foundations are clearly more recent in age. Because of
the limitations on excavation imposed by existing subsurface utilities, pavement
and house foundations, as well as the lack of historic artifacts visible on the
surface, no subsurface testing of this portion of the project area was attempted.

AREA 3
On the southwest side of the project area, southeast of the railroad, a large
overgrown field, which had previously been a commercial property and several
residential properties, had been cleared and was overgrown with grasses and
weeds (see Figure 2). As was the case on the opposite side of the road, a
waterline ran parallel to the sidewalk along the northeastern edge of the new
right-of-way. In addition, SBC cable lines were marked in the northwestern
portions of this section of the project area. Sanborn maps indicate that by
1922, a grocery with attached residence was located here as well as several
small homes between the grocery and railroad track. In order to test for the
possibility of intact deposits associated with grocery, a single backhoe trench
was placed in this area.

Backhoe Trench #1 was dug on the southeast side of the railroad track on the
southwest side of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue. The trench was oriented
northwest-southeast parallel to the existing roadway and located in the middle
of the proposed right-of-way. At the time of the excavation the property was an
unutilized field covered in grass. The location of the trench was chosen based
on early Sanborn Maps which identify a grocery store as present in the
southeastern half of this portion of the project area. The trench was dug in four
connecting segments (1A-1D) beginning on the northwest end and totaling a
length of 41 feet (12.5 meters) by 5.2 feet (1.6 meters) wide (Figure 11). In the
northwestern-most segment (1A), one side of the trench was excavated to a
depth of 3.9 feet (1.2 meters) in order to test for the presence of more deeply
buried prehistoric deposits (considered a very low probability) as well as to
provide information on site formation processes. Throughout the rest of the
trench excavation depth varied from 15.7-23.6 inches (40-60 centimeters) below
surface, all depths below the level at which artifacts (all modern or early 20th
century) were recovered.
Stratigraphy in Backhoe Trench #1 indicates that natural soils are present
beginning at 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) below surface (Figure 12). Natural
soils are very dark grayish brown silty clay loam with calcium carbonate
concretions (CaCO3). Above this are two distinct layers of demolition debris and
fill. The upper fill layer was very dark grayish brown (2.5Y3/2) silty clay loam
and had extensive root intrusion. The second fill layer was a yellowish brown
silty clay loam with 15% gravels. Both fill layers had moderate amounts of
artifact debris within them.
During the course of the excavation of Backhoe Trench #1, no intact
archeological features or contexts were identified. A half circle of artifact bearing
fill was provisionally identified as Feature 1 during the course of the excavation.
However, subsequent excavation indicated that this feature was simply an
unconformity in the buried surface and was not cultural in origin. Artifacts
recovered from the trench indicate that periods of construction and demolition
had effectively mixed artifacts from a period spanning the early through late
twentieth century (Figure 13 & 14). Artifacts recovered from the trench
included architectural debris such as window glass, nails, brick fragments, and
pieces of lumber as well as numerous glass container fragments, some ceramics
and a variety of plastic and metal objects, including childrenâs toys and an iron
wheel. The artifacts recovered were consistent with what might be expected
from the residential and commercial occupations shown on Sanborn maps of the
area. The most interesting aspect of the collection was the large number of clear
or light green glass soda bottle fragments (including both Coca-Cola and Pepsi
bottles) that were found. These bottles are likely associated with the grocery
store that was operating on the site after 1922. Though few temporally
diagnostic artifacts were recovered, several of the bottle fragments were bottled
locally by the St. Johns Bottling Works. On the Sanborn maps this business
first appears on the directory in 1922. One prescription bottle from a local
pharmacy was also recorded, but the panel fragment lacked the name of the
pharmacy, noting only the location as New Braunfels.

NEWLY RECORDED SITE - 41CM319
Site 41CM319 encompasses a triangular area bordered on the southeast by the
railroad line, on the northwest by Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue and on the
southwest by a Sonic (Figure 15). The area of new right-of-way within this
portion of the project area is relatively narrow, extending only 19.9 feet (6.093
meters) southwest of the existing right-of-way. Though the area investigated
only includes the new right-of-way, which is on the northeastern side of the site,
the site boundary is drawn larger to include all potential historic structures that
were constructed on the lots beyond the limits of the current project area.
Archeological investigations at the site included an initial surface inspection and
the excavation of three backhoe trenches. These investigations identified a
single intact foundation pier (Feature 2) and disturbed deposits with artifacts
dating from the late nineteenth/early twentieth century to the present.
Based on Sanborn map data, by 1922 the eastern-most lot of the site (958
Seguin) was the location of the first âColored Public Schoolâ constructed in New
Braunfels. Notations on the Sanborn map describe the building as having âheat
stoves and no lightsâ. The adjoining two lots, 956 and 952 Seguin, had
residential structures. Deed research could not locate any information on the
property before 1927 when the property was sold by the Board of Trustees of the
New Braunfels ISD to Ambrosio and Andres Rio, and presumably the year that
the school stopped functioning as such in this location. By 1930, the building
housing the school was no longer present, and a new residential structure had
been built on the lot (which had been re-numbered 762 Seguin). The adjoining
lot (now 746 Seguin) to the northwest had a store on it, whereas 932/722
Seguin continued to be a residential location. The 1930-1949 Sanborn map
indicates the domestic residence on 762 Seguin had been demolished or moved
closer to the road. The store at 746 Seguin was listed as a restaurant and the
lot at 722 had an additional house added on the front (730 Seguin) with
apartments constructed on the back of the lot.
The site area has recently been bulldozed and no structures are present within
it. Overall the surface coverage varies from patches of dense weeds in which is
visibility is 0% to areas where recent scraping has removed the vegetation,
providing 100% surface visibility and revealing fill deposits below. Within the
new right-of-way, utility lines were found to be present. These included two
inactive water line meter boxes near the edge of the existing right-of-way. Utility
workers reported that an active waterline is also present along the northeastern
edge of the new right-of-way. A Sprint fiber optic cable runs along the
southeastern edge of the site, paralleling the Union Pacific Railroad track. In
addition to recent trash strewn across the site surface, the initial survey of this
portion of the project area identified a piece of orange earthenware, an orange
brick fragment, and the neck and finish of an aqua colored bottle (Figure 16).
The finish on the bottle fragment is typical of patent prescription bottles, and
the mold seams, visible only on the lower portion of the neck, indicate a hand
lipping finish. Based on these characteristics, the bottle is likely to date to the
late nineteenth century or early decades of the twentieth century.
To test for the possibility of intact subsurface deposits associated with the early
twentieth century school or the neighboring structures, three backhoe trenches
were dug within the new right-of-way. The first trench, Backhoe Trench #2, was
dug approximately 100 feet (30.5 meters) west of the Union Pacific Railroad line.

Based on the 1922 Sanborn map, this area should be the approximate location
of the New Braunfels Colored Public School. The narrow width of the proposed
right-of-way in this portion of the project area, however, meant that only the
front of the building was likely to be within the area of investigation. The trench
was oriented northwest-southeast, paralleling Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue.
Backhoe Trench #2 measured 11.3 feet (3.45 meters) in length, 5.1 feet (1.55
meters) in width and was dug to depth of 18.9 inches (48 centimeters below
surface). Two distinct strata were observed during the excavation of the trench.
The upper 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) consisted of a gravelly (60%) very dark
grayish brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam. This silty clay loam is likely the
natural underlying clay, but it has been disturbed and moved around as a
consequence of construction and demolition. A very low density of historic
artifacts was recovered from screened matrix. These included two pulled wire
nails, clear window glass, brown, clear, and light blue bottle glass shards, a
rusted metal washer and several unidentifiable metal fragments (Figure 17).
This overlay the culturally sterile dark grayish brown (10YR3/1) silty clay
sediments found throughout the project area. The high gravel content and the
random mix of relatively recent artifacts in the upper stratum suggest that this
deposit has been seriously disturbed as a result of building activities, possibly
including the construction of the nearby railroad track. Though the trench was
intentionally situated in the area of the Colored Public School, no indications of
the structure or artifacts that could be conclusively associated with it were
identified.

Figure 17: Sample of glass and metal artifacts collected from Backhoe Trench #2.

Backhoe Trench #3 was placed approximately 25 feet (7.62 meters) west of
Backhoe Trench #2 within the new right-of-way. This trench was 25.6 feet (7.8
meters) in total length. The width of the trench varied from 2.5 feet (.75 meters)
in the eastern 2/3s of the trench, where three different pipes or pipe trenches
were identified, and expanded to 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in the final third (Figure
18). The maximum depth of the excavation was 23.6 inches (60 centimeters)
below surface. Similar to Backhoe Trench #2, the upper 11.8 inches (30
centimeters) of the trench was characterized by disturbed fill deposits. In this
portion of the site the fill consisted of interfingered lenses of very dark grayish
brown (10YR3/2) silty clay loam and a chert and limestone gravel, dark
yellowish brown (10YR4/6) sandy loam fill in the eastern third, and only the
gravel fill in the remaining western portion (Figure 19). The fill overlay
culturally sterile dark grayish brown (10YR3/1) silty clay. Artifacts were limited
to occasional sherds of ceramic sewer pipe and clear bottle glass (Figure 20)
found mixed in the fill. In the eastern third of the trench, an older trench was
identified at approximately 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) below surface that ran
diagonally across the backhoe trench. This trench was 19.7 inches (50
centimeters) in width and dug into the sterile natural sediments. The trench
contained a large piece of a sewer pipe, as well as several other large fragments
identical to those found in the overlying fill. A metal water line was found
running perpendicular to the long axis of the trench, 9.2 feet (2.8 meters) west of
the southeast end at a depth of 15.7 inches (40 centimeters) below surface.
Finally, a second ceramic sewer pipe was uncovered 13.1 feet (4 meters) from
the southeast end of the trench running in the same diagonal fashion as the old
trench fill. These utilities appear to have served residential and/or commercial
structures that had previously existed on the site, although it is not possible to
positively link them to any particular structure and they may have been reused
for different structures over time. Aside from the sewer pipe and waterline, no
intact features or archeological surfaces were identified within the trench.

Backhoe Trench #3.

Backhoe Trench #4 was dug in the northwestern half of the site approximately
90 feet (27.4 meters) southeast of the Sonic parking lot. The trench was 21 feet
(6.4 meters) in length and 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) wide (Figure 21). In the
southeastern half, the trench was excavated to a depth of 38.6 inches (98
centimeters) below surface to sample for any deeply buried deposits. The
remainder of the trench varied from 19.7-28.3 inches (50-72 centimeters) below
the ground surface. Consistent with stratigraphy noted in Backhoe Trenches #2
and #3, the upper 11.8-19.7 inches (30-50 centimeters) of matrix was a fill
deposit composed primarily of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) silty clay with
lenses of dark yellowish brown (10YR4/6) sandy gravel fill (Figure 22). This
overlay the same dark grayish brown (10YR3/1) silty clay identified across the
site.
In the course of the trench excavation, a partially intact brick footing pier was
found at 10.6 inches (27 centimeters) below surface in the southern trench
profile and identified as Feature 2 (Figure 23). The foundation pier was cleaned
in the profile and the fill layer overlying the top of the feature was removed. The
foundation pier was found to be placed inside a pit at least 29 X 29 inches in
size and dug to a depth of 28.3 inches (72 centimeters) below the surface. What
remained of the pier consisted of five courses of orange Groesbeck brick set on a
concrete foot and constructed using a fine white mortar. Each course consisted
of four bricks set on their âfaceâ with a mortar core. The pier was 12 inches
(30.5 centimeters) wide in the trench profile and 17 inches (43.2 centimeters)
deep. The pit into which the pier was set was filled with pieces of construction
debris including corrugated metal, brick fragments, mortar chunks, blue
painted plaster, and soil. Unfortunately, none of the artifacts recovered from the
pier pit were temporally diagnostic. Based on the correlation in the profile
between the height of the remaining pier and the natural sediments, it appears

CSJ#: 0016-10-022

Results of Field Investigations

that the foundation pier was truncated at the level of the surface that was
created when the structure that it supported was demolished.
It was subsequently buried under a layer of fill. It is not possible to assign the
pier to a particular building which occupied the lot since its development. The
pier, in and of itself, has little archeological significance and is typical of
construction techniques widely used during the twentieth century.

Artifact recovery in Backhoe Trench #4 was greater than that observed in either
of Backhoe Trenches #2 or #3, though artifacts were clearly in disturbed
secondary contexts (Figures 24 & 25). Many of the artifacts observed in the fill
were architectural debris: Groesbeck brick fragments, sewer pipe, pieces of
lumber, pulled wire nails, and window glass. There were also a number of items
more typical of domestic residences such as a shoe heel, a piece of sawed bone,
orange earthenware pottery, tin and aluminum cans, and clear, green, brown,
aqua and manganese bleached (purpled) bottle glass. Very recent items, such
as ketchup packets and straws from the Sonic next door, and a red plastic milk
bottle ring, were found in mixed association with artifacts spanning a period
beginning as early as the late nineteenth or early twentieth century until the
present. The earliest artifacts observed were bottle fragments. These include an
aqua colored bottle neck with a Perry Davis finish, produced with a hand lipping
tool. This manner of manufacture began to be abandoned around 1903 with the
introduction of the Owens Automatic Bottling Machine, and can thus be
relatively dated to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. A brown glass
bottle shard with a partial embossed medallion reading ââ¦Jones Whiskey,
Louisville, KYâ on the shoulder is likely a late 19th century artifact. The
embossing indicates that the manufacturer of the whiskey is the Paul Jones
distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, but research was unable to identify a more
precise date of production. The manganese bleached glass shards are generally
datable to the period before World War I when the supply of manganese from
Germany was disrupted and the technique was replaced with selenium
bleaching. More recent artifacts include the base and partial body of a Barqâs
Root beer bottle. This bottle has a Brockway bottling mark on the bottom. The
date mark reads â69â, indicating a date of 1969 for the manufacture of the bottle
(Fruitjar.org 2008). Among the other relatively datable materials observed were
several aluminum cans with pull tabs, which were not patented until 1967 (US
Patent Number 3,349,949). One of the cans was labeled âFalstaff Beerâ.

In summary, survey and backhoe trenching in the area of Site 41CM319
recovered artifacts indicative of a period of historic occupation of the property
beginning in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. The presence of
pre-1920s artifacts may indicate that the property was developed before 1922,
prior to the area being included on the New Braunfels Sanborn maps. In all
trenches, artifacts were recovered from deposits that were clearly disturbed and

mixed with fill, and thus have no archeological integrity and very low
interpretative value.
While a single partially intact foundation pier was
identified in Backhoe Trench #4, no other intact features or archeological
surfaces were identified within the new right-of-way. As such, the portions of
the site within the new right-of-way do not meet the standards set forth under
36 CFR 60.4 for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or merit
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Consequently, it is the opinion
of the principal investigator that no further work is necessary within the new
right-of-way. However, the presence of the intact subsurface footing pier and
the association of temporally appropriate artifacts within the boundaries of the
site suggest the possibility for the existence of other intact subsurface features
outside of the current project area. Any future development within the site
boundaries outside of the current project area should, therefore, be conducted
in concert with additional archeological survey in order to document the
presence of any intact and potentially significant features associated with the
New Braunfels Colored Public School or the early residences or businesses.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive linear archeological
survey along the .3 mile segment of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue between
Hampe and Kessler Streets in New Braunfels, Comal County. The entire 1.1
acres of new right-of-way was surveyed as well as the existing right-of-way. The
field survey was completed on December 21, 2007 on behalf of the Texas
Department of Transportation.
Within both the existing right-of-way and new right-of-way, disturbance from
road and building construction, demolition, and utilities infrastructure
placement has seriously disturbed most deposits and mixed archeological
materials from the late nineteenth/early twentieth century with artifacts from
the entire span of the twentieth century. In most cases, demolition and
reconstruction had resulted in the placement of layers of fill or disturbed soils
and obliterated any architectural features associated with the residential and
commercial properties that had previously occupied the areas of new right-ofÂ­
way.
In the course of the investigation, a single new archeological site was recorded:
Site 41CM319. The site is located in the portion of the project area northwest of
the Union Pacific railroad and southwest of Business 46-C/Seguin Avenue,
where residential and commercial buildings as well as the first Colored Public
School in New Braunfels were constructed by at least 1922. Owing to the
potential local historical significance of the school, and the potential for the
existence of other subsurface archeological features to be present outside of the
investigated project area, the site boundaries were drawn around the entire
three lot area. While no artifacts or features associated with the school were
identified, a single brick foundation pier of unknown age associated with the
residential occupation of the lots was recorded. Artifacts dating from the late
nineteenth/early twentieth century through the present day were found in the
deposits surrounding this feature. However, the features and artifacts that were
encountered do not alone possess sufficient integrity or research potential to
warrant nomination as a State Archeological Landmark or for the National
Register of Historic Places. As a result, construction within the new and existing
right-of-way is recommended to proceed without further investigation.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #4742.
