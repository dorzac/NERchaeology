Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Abstract
The Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364) covers almost 60 acres at the confluence of Barton Creek and the
Colorado River in Travis County, Texas. Located within the City of Austin’s Zilker Park, the City’s
premier recreational landscape, the site contains stratified and intact archaeological deposits dating
from the Paleoindian period through the Late Prehistoric period. Previous investigations have revealed
that the oldest deposits are centered within an area of the park known as the Rugby Field at depths
of approximately 3–5 meters below the modern ground surface (mbs). Due to unavoidable adverse
impacts to the site resulting from construction of a new wastewater outfall line, and in compliance
with the Texas Antiquities Code, the City consulted with the Texas Historical Commission and agreed
to conduct archaeological excavations that would be designed to recover information about the deeply
buried Paleoindian component of the site.
Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) was awarded a competitively-bid contract with the
City in December 2008 to conduct the data recovery excavations. Under Texas Antiquities Permit 5177,
fieldwork began on March 23, 2009. All work was conducted under an OSHA-compliant trench safety
plan. An estimated 48 m3 of sediment were mechanically removed down to 3 mbs. An additional 32 m3
were hand excavated between 3 and 5 mbs and were screened through ¼-inch mesh. Material recovered
from the hand excavations includes 1,328 pieces of chipped stone, 50 pieces of burned rocks, more than
20,000 snails, and over 300 mussel shell pieces. Five buried features were discovered including two
burned rock hearths, an occupation surface, a chipped stone concentration, and a stain. Collected noncultural materials included more than 30,000 unmodified gravels and 320 sediment samples. Concurrent
with the excavations, a public outreach program included an on-site information station staffed by a
professional archaeologist eight hours per day, seven days per week; tours of the site for school children
and youth groups; a dedicated project website including a live video feed transmitted through an on-site
webcam; interactive weekend activities such as atlatl throwing and flint knapping; and supervised
screening by the public of the mechanically excavated overburden. The public screening recovered
an additional 901 pieces of chipped stone from the 2–3 mbs overburden. Fieldwork was concluded on
May 30, 2009, at which time the site was backfilled, resodded, and returned to service as a sports field.
After completion of field work, analysis began by examining variability by depth in artifact frequency
and size, soil magnetic susceptibility, soil particle size, and soil chemistry to delineate temporally
discrete analytical units. Four units were thus defined; all four show a low overall frequency of cultural
material per volume when compared to other similar sites in the region. Dating was accomplished using
14 radiocarbon assays of bulk sediment and isotope assays on mussel shells. Analysis of the chipped
stone assemblage identified an early Paleoindian, Clovis-like, occupation dating to about 10,905–9840
BP at about 4.1–4.9 mbs. Above this, a Late Paleoindian occupation dating to about 9634–9230 BP is
seen in the lithic assemblage from 3.3 to 3.6 mbs. An Early Archaic occupation was identified above
this depth. Using analyses of land snails, mussel shells, and site geomorphology, a paleoenvironmental
reconstruction suggests that from about 10,480 to 9840 BP, the site area transitioned from a gravel
point bar to a lower flood basin, then to an upper flood basin with terrace accretion deposits by around
9600 BP. Finally, generally finer terrace deposits covered the immediate area through about 8600 BP
and later.

Abstract

All project records and the artifacts and samples that were recovered from the hand excavations between
3 and 5 mbs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. Pursuant to an
agreement between the Texas Historical Commission and the City of Austin, the artifacts that were
recovered through public screening of the mechanically excavated 2–3 mbs overburden will be returned
to the City for use in future exhibits and public outreach activities.

Acknowledgments
Our primary thanks go to the City of Austin who funded this investigation, and to Project Manager
Jules Parrish, who facilitated our work at every stage of the project and for whose constant support
and encouragement we are vastly appreciative. Also with the City of Austin, we are thankful for the
help from Margaret Russell of the Parks and Recreation Department and Janice Sturrock and Clark
Hancock with the Austin Nature and Science Center, who assisted our excavations and our public
outreach program. Sarah Hartley, with the City of Austin Public Works Department, also helped with
publicity. During the excavations, City inspectors Bob Pilgrim and Alexa Locklear made weekly safety
inspections and certified compliance with the Trench Safety Plan. The excavations were also inspected
several times by Mark Denton and Jim Bruseth of the Texas Historic Commission for compliance with
the research design.
The excavation effort was led by Project Archaeologist Rich Jones, who accomplished remarkable feats
of logistical planning and coordination, and the hard-working field crew that consisted of David Nickels,
Mason Miller, John Campbell, Noel Steinle, Jason Whitaker, Emory Worrell, and Talle Hogrefe. Our
OSHA-competent persons, Mason Miller and John Campbell, made daily safety inspections of the
excavation and shoring systems. As always, we are immensely grateful for the highly professional
contributions of Project Geoarchaeologist Charles Frederick.
Our award-winning public outreach program was designed and led by Rachel Feit and Mason Miller.
Archaeologists who staffed the on-site public information station 8 hours per day, 7 days per week,
and who instructed and supervised the public in the public screening effort were Stacy Drake and Matt
Carter, with additional assistance provided on weekends and during busy periods by Mason Miller,
John Campbell, Dan Rose, and Maggie McClain. In addition, enthusiastic Texas Archeological Society
volunteers Christine Gauger and David Parkhill helped supervise the public screening effort. The
marvelous project website was wholly designed and maintained by Mason Miller with assistance from
Nathan Hanners of Really Really Big Industries, Inc. Dan Rose installed and maintained the webcam.
Steve Black graciously allowed us to use content from Texas Beyond History in our public education
effort. Roy Wenmohs of the Austin Atlatlists and Logan McNatt of Texas Parks and Wildlife gave atlatl
throwing demonstrations, and Chris Ringstaff of the Texas Department of Transportation also gave a
superb flintknapping demonstration.
EComm was supported throughout every stage of the project by our colleagues at Hicks & Company,
and we are glad to have had the opportunity to team with them. John King, PE of Raymond Chan and
Associates, prepared the engineering Site Plan and the request for exemption from the City of Austin
development requirements. The OSHA-compliant trench plan was developed by Sean Douglass of
GeoSolutions, Inc., and was sealed by Carey M. Witt, PE. National Trench and Safety provided the
trench shields and shoring devices and Joe Kincaid supervised their installation according to the trench
plan. At JHarper Construction Company, James Harper was skillful and incredibly patient with us in
installing the silt fencing, conducting the mechanical excavations, and installing, re-installing, and
removing the shoring systems. Our security fencing was provided by National Construction Rentals.
Sean Taggert with Sentry Security, Inc. coordinated the after-hours security guard.
Two serendipitous studies became valuable components to our project. While excavations were
ongoing, Ken Brown of The University of Texas at Austin visited the site and proposed analysis of land
snails. Similarly, David O. Brown of Anthony & Brown Consulting became interested in our sample

of deeply buried bivalves and proposed conducting isotope analysis on this assemblage. Examination,
analysis, and photo-documentation of the lithic assemblage was expertly conducted by Steve Tomka of
The University of Texas at San Antonio, with assistance from Cynthia Munoz, Eric Oksanen, and Ray
Mauldin. We are also grateful for the contributions of Robert Howells (bivalve identification), Mervin
Kontrovitz (ostrocodes), Barbara Winsborough (diatom analysis), Leslie Bush (botanical analysis),
Jim Feathers at the University of Washington Luminescence Dating Laboratory (OSL assays), Robert
Sternberg at Franklin and Marshall College (archaeomagnetic assays), and the Texas A&M University
Soil, Water, and Forage Testing Laboratory (soil testing).
After completion of the field work, Rich Jones accepted a position at Fort Hood and the responsibilities
of Project Archaeologist were ably assumed by Dave Nickels. Dan Rose supervised and coordinated the
archaeology laboratory. Flotation processing was conducted by Samantha Champion and wet screening
of snail samples was conducted by Cyndi Rodriquez. Most of the site synthesis was expertly developed
by Dave Nickels, and much of this report has been authored by Dave and by Mason Miller. During the
final stages of analysis, Ken Brown, David O. Brown, Steve Tomka, and Charles Frederick became key
collaborators on the paleoenvironmental reconstruction and archaeological interpretations. Addition
contributors to the report have included Josh Haefner, Samantha Champion, and Dan Rose. Joel Butler
has served as project GIS expert, and Maggie McClain assembled diverse elements and integrated,
edited, and laid these out into the current report.
The success of this project has resulted from the combined efforts of a remarkably talented and
multidisciplinary team, and all of these colleagues, consultants, and contributors are gratefully
acknowledged.

Introduction and Project Background
By David L. Nickels and W. Nicholas Trierweiler

1.1	Site Location
and Setting
The Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364) in Travis
County, Texas is located at the confluence
of Barton Creek and the Colorado River. At
this point in the Colorado, the river emerges
from a natural limestone canyon, emptying
into a wider stream bounded by active alluvial
floodplains and alluvial terraces on either
side. Barton Creek empties into the Colorado
River on its southern bank. Barton Springs is
located along Barton Creek approximately ½
mile upstream from its confluence with the
Colorado River. It is the fourth largest spring
in Texas, pumping an average 27 millions
gallons of water a day up from the Edwards
Aquifer through fissures in the limestone
bedrock of the creek bed. It is believed that the
springs began flowing about 9,000 years ago.
The Vara Daniel Site is located just northeast
of the springs and is bounded on three sides by
the Colorado River and Barton Creek.
The site lies entirely within Zilker Park, the
City of Austin’s primary downtown public
recreation space. The area has been parkland
since 1917, when Andrew Zilker sold 50 acres
of land around Barton Springs to the City of
Austin. In subsequent years, he sold additional
parcels to the City. Today, Zilker Park covers
351 acres. The current Zilker landscape is highly
manicured, consisting of maintained fields
used for sports, picnicking, outdoor concerts,
and other recreational activities. The natural
landscape consists of flat to gently rolling
uplands on Pleistocene to Holocene terraces that
formed along the river and creek valleys. These
open, deep terraces are occasionally punctuated
Ecological Communications Corporation

by limestone outcrops of bedrock that formed
during the Cretaceous era. The landscape is
mostly open today, though in the past it would
likely have been much more heavily vegetated
with riparian woodland growth.
Site 41TV1364 is horizontally extensive,
covering almost 60 acres between Barton Creek
and the Colorado River (Figure 1-1). The site
is bounded on the west side by a natural slope
consisting of high limestone bedrock outcrops;
Barton Creek and the Colorado River form
the south, east, and north site boundaries. The
current investigations focus on a small portion
of the site, located in what is commonly referred
to as the Rugby Field and situated between
Barton Springs Road and Barton Creek. The
Rugby Field sits on a natural Holocene terrace,
overlying a Pleistocene terrace with alluvial
sediments reaching more than eight meters (m),
or 30 feet (ft), in depth in some places before
reaching the water table. The field is open, thinly
vegetated with domestic grass, and ringed by
pecan and live oak trees of various ages. The
field slopes gently to the south, toward Barton
Creek and ranges in elevation from 470 to 460
ft above mean sea level (amsl).

1.2	Previous Investigations
Archaeological deposits around Barton Creek
in Zilker Park were identified as early as 1928,
when J. E. Pearce conducted archaeological
investigations on the south side of Barton Creek
Table 1-1). The site he investigated is known as
41TV2 and originally encompassed areas on
the north side of the creek as well, now formally
designated 41TV1364. Site 41TV1364, the

1986 when Espey Huston & Associates (now

Late Paleoindian through Historic periods
(Espey Huston & Associates 1988).
Since that time, there have been two sets of
investigations related to the South Austin
Outfall line, the alignment of which has been

altered to minimize impacts to 41TV1364. In
1989 and 1992, archaeologists at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
conducted investigations in two phases
consisting of seven trenches and 14 auger
holes reaching a maximum depth of 6.5 m
(21.3 ft) along the proposed route of the
outfall line. Through radiocarbon dating and
artifact recovery, this investigation confirmed
the presence of stratified buried deposits
representing the Paleoindian through Historic
period. This work also identified the Rugby
Field as the area of highest research potential
for intact deposits due to the deep stratified
alluvial and colluvial sediments comprising
the terrace at that location (Ricklis et al. 1991;
Takac et al. 1992).
In 2003, a new route for the South Austin
Outfall pipeline was selected, and the City of
Austin sponsored a second set of investigations.
Phase I of the investigations took place in 2003
and consisted of excavation of 21 cores, each
7 centimeters (cm), or 2.8 inches in diameter,
and three auger holes 110 cm (43 inches) in
diameter excavated to maximum depth of
8.5 m (27.9 ft) along the proposed outfall
line route. The dirt from the
cores was subject to flotation
analysis, while the dirt from
the augers was dry–screened.
Recovered items included 137
lithic artifacts and 53 bone
fragments, plus fire–cracked
rocks and a charcoal sample.
The work echoed the previous
investigations and concluded
that the area of highest research
potential for the site was at the
Rugby Field (Nash et al. 2008).
Due to unavoidable adverse
impacts to the site resulting
from the South Austin Outfall
Relief Main, the City agreed
to fund a limited excavation
within the Rugby Field. In
order to refine the placement

Ecological Communications Corporation

of the proposed excavation, the Phase II
investigations consisted of systematic coring
within the Rugby Field. This work involved
13 auger holes 20 cm (7.9 inches) in diameter
excavated to a depth of 6.5 m (21.3 ft) below
ground surface. This work yielded 887 stone
artifacts, which included three projectile points
or point fragments, 10 bifaces, five unifaces,
one core, and one utilized flake. Seven bulk soil
samples were submitted for Accelerator Mass
Spectrometry (AMS) dating; these samples
yielded dates ranging from about 1000 BC to
about 11,000 BC. The Phase II investigations
identified the north–central portion of the
Rugby Field in the vicinity of tests 2, 3, 11,
and 12 (Figure 1-2) as the area with the highest
research potential, particularly with respect to
Paleoindian deposits (Nash et al. 2008).

1.3	Data Recovery
Scope of Work
The Paleoindian deposits were of great
archaeological interest. Such deposits can
be especially valuable cultural resources
because they contain information about the

Introduction and Project Background

very earliest human occupation of North
America. Due to their great age, Paleoindian
deposits are rare and have an inherently greater
chance of being destroyed, severely disturbed,
or obscured than do younger deposits, both
through natural processes (erosion, deep
burial) as well as anthropogenic processes
(development, landscape modifications). The
Paleoindian deposits at Zilker Park appeared to
be intact and offered the possibility of a rich
source of information.
For these reasons, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) agreed to allow
construction of the South Austin Outfall
project with the stipulation that the City of
Austin would sponsor an archaeological data
recovery excavation in the area of the Rugby
Field. Accordingly, on August 22, 2008, the
City issued a request for proposals (RFP) for
“consultation and professional services to
complete an archaeological investigation and
related services on city property.” The RFP
scope of services stated, in part:
On City property, the upper 3 meters
(10 feet) of a 4 meter by 4 meter (172
square feet) excavation area will be
mechanically removed (excavated
straight down) and only the lowest
approximate 2 meters (6.5 feet) of depth
will be subjected to controlled hand
excavation in 1–x–1–meter excavation
units in 10–cm levels to base of the
cultural deposits and screened through
6.3–mm (1/4–inch) hardware cloth.
One 20–x–10–cm soil sample will be
collected from each 10–cm level of each
1–x–1–meter unit for flotation analysis.
The stratigraphy of each excavation unit
will be documented through drawing
and photography of at least one complete
wall profile. Any cultural features
encountered will be documented
through drawings and photographs. A
sample of the interior feature matrix up
to 20 liters in volume will be collected
for flotation analysis. Any additional
feature matrix in excess of 20 liters

4

will be screened through 3.2–mm
(1/8–inch) hardware cloth. If vertically
discrete, culturally sterile zones are
identified within the stratigraphic
profile; they may be investigated
using
less
intensive
excavation
and flotation sampling techniques.
The consultant will be prepared to
make the necessary shoring/stepping
provisions in accordance with OSHA
[Occupational Safety and Health
Administration] regulations. Field crew
personnel under direction of the Lead
Archaeologist will define features,
not the backhoe or heavy equipment
operator (City of Austin 2008).
Further instructions directed that the total
disturbed area (including the excavation block,
access ramps, etc.) was to be minimized as
much as possible using tactics other than
traditional trench stepping. The RFP also
stipulated that the excavation was to provide
for a public outreach program to include, at
a minimum, a temporary interpretive exhibit
staffed by an archaeologist seven days a week
during the field work.
In response to the RFP, EComm submitted a
written proposal to the City on September 22
and followed this with an interview in early
November. The City awarded the contract to
EComm on January 6, 2009. Field work began
on March 23 and was completed by May 30.
Major subcontractors during the field
work phase included Hicks & Company
(archaeological support services), Charles
Frederick
(geoarchaeology),
Raymond
Chan and Associates (engineering and civil
permitting), JHarper Construction Company
(silt fencing, mechanical excavation, and
installation/removal of shoring systems),
National Trench and Safety (trench safety plan
and shoring devices), National Fence (security
fencing), and Sentry Security (after–hours
security guard). Following the completion

of fieldwork, EComm engaged numerous
specialists and consultants including Steve
Tomka (lithic analysis), Ken Brown (land
snails), Bob Howells (bivalves), David O.
Brown (bivalve isotope analysis), Mervin
Kontrovitz (ostrocodes), Barbara Winsborough
(diatoms), Leslie Bush (botanical analysis),

This report is structured within three
main parts. The first part, Chapters 1–5,
provides the environmental, theoretical, and
methodological background for the excavation
project. The second part, Chapters 6–16,
presents empirical results. The contributions
and analyses of individual consultants are
presented as self–standing chapters. The third
part consists of Chapters 17 and 18. These
discussions integrate the various threads of the
results, address research issues, summarize,
and present conclusions. Finally, a series
of appendices discuss the public outreach
program, present the artifact catalog, and
summarize various data sets.

1.5	Data Collected
An estimated 48 m3 of sediment were removed
mechanically during this project and an
additional 32 m3 were excavated by hand.
Cultural material collected from the excavations
includes 1,328 pieces of chipped stone, and
50 pieces (3.828 kilograms [kg]) of burned
rocks. In addition, 901 pieces of chipped stone
were collected during public screening of the
mechanically removed overburden pile. Two
burned rock hearths, an occupation surface
with a lithic and mussel shell scatter, a chipped
stone concentration area, and a darkened stain
were discovered during the excavations.
Non–cultural materials in the form of over
30,000 natural, unmodified gravels and
calcium carbonate nodules (15.653 kg) were
collected. Soil samples were either collected,
or data extracted in the field from over
400 proveniences for use in obtaining soil
susceptibility values, pH values, sand, silt, clay
content, and organic carbon. Archaeologists
also collected 320 sediment samples (ca.
3.2 m3) that were either floated, analyzed for
carbon content, or will remain curated at TARL
for future analyses. Also collected were over
20,000 snails and over 300 mussell shell pieces.

Modern Environmental Setting
By John A. Campbell

2.1	Physiographic Setting
Site 41TV1364 is located along the Balcones
Escarpment within Central Texas, between the
Edwards Plateau to the west and the Blackland
Prairie to the east. The project area is located
at the confluence of the Colorado River and
Barton Creek in southwest Austin. This area
is at the southeastern edge of the Great Plains
of North America and the western edge of the
West Gulf Coastal Plain (Riskind and Diamond
1988). The Balcones Escarpment is the result
of a fault zone that arcs through Central Texas,
resulting in a dramatic shift in elevation
between the coastal plain and the plateaus
to the west. This transition zone between the
coastal plain and the southern plains to the
west is called the Balcones Canyonlands,
an area of steeply dissected canyons with
high, rounded hills and plateaus (Riskind
and Diamond 1988). The uplands within the
Balcones Canyonlands are characterized by
shallow soils with vegetation consisting of
oak and juniper savannah (Collins 2004).
To the east of the Balcones Canyonlands is
the Blackland Prairie of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. This area is characterized by broad
rolling plains with soft marl bedrock and
deep calcareous clays. The vegetation in the
Blackland Prairie is mostly grassland, but also
supports post oak forests in some areas (Collins
2004). Areas along the escarpment within
the canyonlands offer a unique environment
for humans to occupy. By occupying this
transitional area, humans are able to exploit
contrasting resources within the different
ecotones and thus diversify their subsistence
and settlement (Collins 2004). Key resources

Ecological Communications Corporation

within the Balcones Canyonlands were the
numerous springs that discharged from the
Edwards Aquifer. Site 41TV1364, located
adjacent to Barton Springs within Zilker
Park, and along the Colorado River and
Barton Creek, provided an ideal location for
settlement throughout history and prehistory.

2.2	Climate
Zilker Park is located within the Subtropical
Humid climate region of Texas. This region
extends north to south across the eastern
portion of the state and is characterized by
warm summers and mild winters (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). The average annual precipitation
within the region is about 32 inches, which
falls mostly as rain in the early summer and
fall. Precipitation is highest in the months of
May and June (3.78–3.13 inches) and also in
the month of September (3.61 inches) (Anaya
2004; Carr 1967; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
This is due to the direction of prevailing
winds coming from the southeast off the
Gulf of Mexico during these times (Slade
1986). These southerly, moisture-laden winds
generally clash with cooler, dryer air from
the north, causing a release of moisture over
the Edwards Plateau during these months. In
addition, the warm, moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico rises along the Balcones Escarpment
and cools, causing precipitation along this
feature, and often times heavy storms, during
these months (Carr 1967; Slade 1986). During
the winter months between November and
March, precipitation drops to around 1.75 to
2.5 inches as colder, dryer air moves in from
the plains (Larkin and Bomar 1983).

7

Chapter 2

Modern Environmental Setting

Average temperatures in Travis County
typically reach into the upper 90s during the
summer months, with average low temperatures
reaching into the 30s during the winter
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). The average annual
temperature of the region is 21°C (70°F) (Carr
1967). January is typically the coldest month
with average low/high temperatures of 2/16°C
(36/60°F), while July and August are generally
the hottest months with average low/high
temperatures of 23/36°C (73/96°F) (Larkin and
Bomar 1983).

2.3	Hydrology
The Colorado River is the primary drainage in
the region and is supplied by numerous streams
and tributaries, as well as by seeps and springs
from the Edwards Aquifer. The Colorado River
drains from northwest to southeast, extending
approximately 475 kilometers (km) (300 miles)
from the project area down to the Gulf of Mexico
(Feit et al. 2003). To the west of the Balcones
Escarpment, the region is heavily dissected by
stream channels that have cut down into the
Edwards limestone. The Edwards limestone
also serves to restrict or guide the flow of
water for streams in the area (Woodruff and
Abbot 1986). The sparse vegetation in the arid
regions to the west of the Balcones Escarpment
allow for considerable surface runoff, which is
considered to be the main source of water in
those areas (Woodruff and Wilding 2008).
To the east, within the Blackland Prairie, there
is less relief and the topography shifts towards
broad coastal plain overlying deep marls and
clays. These conditions allow for the Colorado
River to expand its floodplain over broad areas
with deep sediments. The floodplain in which
41TV1364 is located is the first substantive
floodplain of the Colorado River east of the
Balcones Escarpment. Barton Creek also
begins west of the escarpment and flows south
and east until turning northeast to intersect with
the Colorado River at the easternmost corner
of Zilker Park. Although Barton Creek drains
a large area to the west, it is most noted for
8

its springs, which have attracted wildlife and
people for thousands of years.
Several environmental factors of the Balcones
Escarpment play a significant role in the
hydrology of the region. Due to the semi-arid
nature of the Balcones Escarpment, the region
is prone to both severe flooding and severe
droughts (Woodruff and Wilding 2008). These
same semi-arid conditions also increase surface
water run-off and erosion of the surrounding
steep terrain, resulting in the sedimentation
of the streams (Woodruff and Wilding 2008).
Finally, changes in precipitation and the rapid
run-off of water cause variability in the water
levels and quality of the groundwater (Woodruff
and Wilding 2008). All of these factors play
an important role in human survival in this
region with regard to available water and also
available plant and animal resources.

2.4	Geology
The Balcones Escarpment represents the
remains of the Ouachita Mountains that formed
during a tectonic event at the end of the Paleozoic
Era (Anaya 2004; Edwards Aquifer Authority
2004). The Ouachita Mountains extended
from Mexico to Arkansas and allowed for the
formation of shallow seas to the northwest.
During the Early Cretaceous, shallow seas
advanced across this area, depositing sediments
that formed the Glen Rose formation and began
formation of the Stuart City Reef Trend (Anaya
2004). In the Cenozoic Era, faulting along
the buried Ouachita Mountains range caused
regional uplift, forming the Balcones Fault
Zone and displacing Cretaceous and Lower
Tertiary sediments (Anaya 2004; Edwards
Aquifer Authority 2004). The current landscape
has been formed by the continual down-cutting
of streams and rivers through the Balcones
Escarpment as they make their way to the Gulf
of Mexico.
Site 41TV1364 is located over a broad area
within the southeastern portion of Zilker Park,
and extends over the floodplain of the Colorado
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

River and Barton Creek and into the adjacent
uplands to the west. The surface geology
of the site area is primarily represented by
Pleistocene-age fluviatile deposits (Qt) and
the Lower Cretaceous Fredericksburg Group
undivided bedrock (Kfr). The Pleistocene
fluviatile deposits within the site consist of
deep silts, sands, gravels, and clays primarily
redeposited from the Edwards Plateau to the
west. Gravels occurring in these sediments
consist of dolomite, limestone, chert, and quartz,
as well as igneous and metamorphic rocks
from the Llano region. The Fredericksburg
Group undivided consists of porous, Lower
Cretaceous limestone and dolomite with some
chert. Formations from this group outcrop
along the western edge of the site and within
the northern portion of the site.
To the south, along the right bank of Barton
Creek, are outcrops of the Del Rio Clay and
Georgetown Formation undivided (Kdg). These
Lower Cretaceous formations consist of finegrained, indurated limestone, marls, siltstones,
shales, and gypsum. Northwest of the site
are several faults that trend from northeast to
southwest. These faults occur in the uplands
adjacent to and west of Loop 1 (MoPac).

2.5	Soils
The soils within site 41TV1364 at Zilker Park
consist of deep, alluvial sediments derived from
Colorado River and Barton Creek flood events.
These soils developed over the Pleistocene
fluviatile deposits along the lower terraces
and bottomlands of these watercourses. There
are two soil associations mapped within the
boundaries of the site, the Brackett association
and the Bergstrom-Norwood association
(Werchan et al. 1974). The Brackett
association consists of shallow, gravelly,
loamy soils overlying interbedded limestone
and marl. These soils generally occupy gently
undulating to steeply sloped landforms.
The Bergstrom-Norwood association is
characterized by deep, calcareous, loamy soils
that formed over recent and ancient alluvium.
Ecological Communications Corporation

Soils within this association occupy the low
terraces and bottomlands adjacent to streams
and rivers (Werchan et al. 1974). Although
the site boundaries overlap with both of these
soil associations, the location of the current
investigations was within the BergstromNorwood association.
The individual soil series within site
41TV1364 are mapped as Hardeman soils
and urban land (HdE) and Bergstrom soils
and urban land (Bh) (Werchan et al. 1974).
Both of these soil groups formed in recent
and ancient alluvium that was deposited
during previous flood events. The Hardeman
soils are deep and form over ancient alluvium
along narrow terraces or footslopes above
floodplains (Werchan et al. 1974). In general,
these soils have an A Horizon of brown, fine,
sandy loam to a depth of approximately 40 cm.
The B Horizon consists of light brown, fine,
sandy loam between approximately 40 and 96
cm below the ground surface (cmbs; Werchan
et al. 1974). Underlying the B Horizon, the
C Horizon extends to more than 152 cmbs
and consists of reddish yellow silt loam. All
of these horizons are calcareous soils with
few gravels, generally granular and friable in
structure (Werchan et al. 1974). The Hardeman
soils are classified as Typic Ustochrepts,
indicating they are inceptisols formed in hot
climates with an ochric epipedon (Brady and
Weil 2002; Werchan et al. 1974). Inceptisols
are characterized as younger soils that do not
have well-developed soil profiles (Brady and
Weil 2002).
The Bergstrom soils are mapped over a large
portion of the lower floodplain within Zilker
Park, adjacent to the Colorado River and Barton
Creek (Werchan et al. 1974). These deep, welldrained soils on low terraces and bottomlands
formed over recent and ancient alluvium below
mid- to tall prairie grasses (Werchan et al.
1974). The A Horizon of the Bergstrom soils is
dark grayish brown silty loam to silty clay loam
to a depth of approximately 50 cmbs. Below
this horizon, the B Horizon consists of reddish
brown silty loam to a depth of approximately
9

Chapter 2

Modern Environmental Setting

150 cmbs (Werchan et al. 1974). The C Horizon
is reddish yellow clay loam to silty loam
extending to more than 200 cmbs. Both the
A and B Horizons are generally granular and
friable in structure, while the C Horizon has
no structure, but is friable and often contains
thin lenses of more clayey or sandy sediment
(Werchan et al. 1974). All three horizons are
calcareous, with calcium carbonate concretions
occurring in the C Horizon. In addition, powdery
or indurated limestone masses can occur in the
lower B and C Horizons (Werchan et al. 1974).
The Bergstrom soils are classified as Cumulic
Haplustolls, which are mollisols that formed
under hot conditions under grasslands, and
have a thick mollic epipedon (organic rich zone
with calcium and magnesium) (Brady and Weil
2002; Werchan et al. 1974).

2.6	Land Use
Zilker Park and Barton Springs have been
utilized for commercial and recreational uses
since the early nineteenth century. Sawmills,
gristmills, flour mills, and ice-making
machines were all present near the springs at
various times prior to it becoming a city park
(Brune 2009). In 1917, A. J. Zilker deeded 50
acres of land surrounding the springs to the
City of Austin to form a park for the citizens
of Austin (City of Austin 2009a). Zilker
donated an additional 250 acres in 1931 and
also 25 acres before his death in 1934 to be
added to the park (City of Austin 2009a). It
is unknown whether the previous owners had
utilized the land for agriculture or livestock.
An 1896 1:125,000 scale USGS map of
Austin shows three structures within the park
boundaries and a series of roads along Barton
Creek (Figure 2-1). Two of these roads cross
Barton Creek just south of the Vara Daniel
Site; presumably there were bridges or low
water crossings here.
The development, maintenance, and use of
the park have likely had the most impact
on the natural setting of the park. The most

10

substantive development in the park has
been primarily around the springs, where
the city has constructed a concrete dam
and pool, and along Barton Creek, where
development includes maintenance buildings
and public facilities. The utilities that service
these facilities at the park, such as electric,
water, and sewer, are likely buried along
the roads within the park and possibly other
areas (although the exact location of these
utilities is unknown). Based on 7.5’ USGS
topographic maps, the roads in the park
appear to have been relatively unchanged
since 1954 (Figures 2-2 through 2-6). Barton
Springs Road appears on all of these maps
and was therefore constructed sometime prior
to 1954. However, the loop around the field
north of Barton Springs Road (Kite Field)
was moved further west to a point just north
of the current excavations sometime between
1973 and 1988, based on topographic maps
from those years (see Figures 2-5 and 2-6).
Furthermore, the loop around the Rugby
Field where it connects with Barton Springs
Road near the creek was also changed at this
point; currently, a parking lot occupies the
area between Rugby Field, Barton Creek,
and Barton Springs Road. Additional impacts

carts, mowing and turf maintenance, and
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian traffic is
intensified during several events that are
hosted at the park annually, such as the Austin
Kite Festival, Austin City Limits Festival, and
the Trail of Lights. Intensive use of the park
area has resulted in diminished vegetation,
which has likely exacerbated erosion across
the site. However, these impacts are generally
shallow or limited to the ground surface.

games it is heavily utilized for informal sports
and other non-vehicle recreation. The field
is surrounded by park roads and two large
parking lots to the east and west. Impacts to
the site are primarily limited to light vehicle
traffic from trucks and small maintenance

12

In addition to direct impacts within the park,
the surrounding landscape has been heavily
developed for residential and commercial
uses. Several apartment buildings and homes
overlook the park from the south side of
Barton Creek. Commercial developments
such as restaurants and bars are concentrated
along Barton Springs Road to the east of
the park. These development projects have
intensified over the last decade. Although this
development has had no direct impact on the
park, it has likely increased pedestrian traffic
on the site. Overall, it is estimated that the
initial development of the park had the largest
impact on the site through the construction of
utilities, roads, and park facilities.

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context
By J. Joshua Haefner, John A. Campbell, David L. Nickels, and Mason D. Miller

Texans, in one iteration or another, have been
here for more than 11,000 years. From the
earliest visitors to the New World, who likely
crossed over a land bridge in the Bering Sea and
hunted the region’s long-extinct sloths, bears,
mastadons, and mammoths, to shopkeepers
along Congress Avenue who drive to work,
Texas’ inhabitants have shaped and been shaped
by their environment. While excavations at the
Vara Daniel Site focused on the lives of the
site’s earliest inhabitants, other inhabitants
to the region are worth brief discussion.
Additionally, the region’s ancient climatic
shifts, which can be considered the single most
significant influence on human culture and
cultural adaption, will also be summarized in
an effort to better understand what life was like
for these people and how they adapted to the
challenges of the natural world, shaping it into
the Texas that we know today.

3.1	Paleoenvironmental
Reconstruction
During the last 20 years, bolstered by the
development of new techniques and the
accumulation of larger data sets with better
spatial and temporal coverage, archaeologists,
geoarchaeologists,
palynologists,
and
paleontologists have begun to investigate
climate and environmental change during
the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, in an
effort to better understand its influence on
human lifeways. At present, models for
paleoenvironmental reconstruction for the
Texas region are largely based on Collins’ and
Bousman’s (1993) synthesis of pollen data
from the Weakly, Boriack, South Soefje, and
Ecological Communications Corporation

Hershop bog locales, and Toomey’s (1993)
faunal sequence reconstructions from the Hall’s
Cave locale. Recent research has amplified
these efforts and contributed greatly toward
an understanding of the paleoenvironment
of Texas (eg., Bousman 1998; Brown 1998;
Caran 1998; Frederick 1998; Fredlund et al.
1998; Karbula et al. 2007; Kibler 1998; Nordt
et al. 2002; Ricklis and Cox 1998; Thoms and
Mandel 2007; Figure 3-1).

20,000–14,000 Years
Before Present [BP])
Data from south-central United States suggest
that during the last glacial maximum, regional
temperatures were significantly lower than
at present, perhaps as much as 6°C (10.8°F)
cooler during the summer months (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Delcourt and Delcourt
1985; Toomey et al. 1993). At the same
time, massive northern glaciers formed a
natural barrier for cold arctic air, resulting in
winters that were most likely relatively mild
and comparable to those of the modern day
(Toomey et al. 1993:304). In addition to nowextinct megafauna, animals that now inhabit
cooler and moister niches to the north and east
shared the Edwards Plateau with animals that
today are at the northern extent of their range.
Graham and Lundelius (1984) suggest that this
is evidence for reduced seasonality during the
full-glacial.
Faunal remains from burrowing species such
as the prairie dog, pocket gopher, and moles in
various Texas cave sites indicate that soils were

most likely much deeper and more weathered
than those present in much of the modern
region. Deep, red clays intermixed with small
limestone clasts are frequently found within
redeposited cave deposits, further indicating
that uplands of Central Texas contained deep
soils and likely supported more lush plant
communities (Toomey et al. 1993).
Pollen studies from Patschke and, later, Gause
and Franklin Bogs in east-central Texas were
conducted by J. E. Potzger and B. C. Tharp
(1943, 1947, 1954). The presence of spruce
(Picea) pollen, a species that typically favors
cooler climes, was inferred to indicate a boreal
forest across Central Texas for much of the
Pleistocene. A later increase in the frequency
of grass (Gramineae) and oak (Quercus) was
interpreted as a shift to a warm and dry climate.
While novel, Potzger and Tharps’ work
predated radiocarbon dating and, hence, lacks
absolute ages.
Variations in growth rates of speleothems
(cave dripstones) have been demonstrated
14

to be causally linked to patterns of
hydrologic recharge and rainfall
(Lauritzen and Lundberg 1999).
Because they are well suited to
uranium-series dating, speleothems
can
provide
high-resolution
paleoclimate histories. Musgrove et
al. (2001) detailed the growth records
of four stalagmites from three Central
Texas caves (Inner Space Cavern,
Double Decker Cave, and Cave
Without a Name) to assess temporal
changes in hydrology and climate.
Three periods of rapid growth
were identified: 71,000–60,000 BP,
39,000–33,000 BP, and 24,000–
12,000 BP. The last identified growth
period corresponds with models that
propose a wetter period for Central
Texas during the full-glacial.

A Gulf of Mexico that was both
smaller and most likely much cooler
resulted in much lower tropical storms
passing through the region, and lower
incidences of intense, convectional storms in
the Texas interior. Instead, precipitation was
most likely very regular and cyclonic, carried
into the region by a lower jet stream, carrying
moisture from the Pacific (Toomey et al.
1993:312).

3.1.2 Late-Glacial (ca.
14,000–ca. 10,000 BP)
Faunal evidence from the Edwards Plateau
indicates that sometime after 15,000 years
ago, average temperatures (particularly
summer temperatures) increased rapidly
(Hall 1981; Toomey 1991, 1992; Toomey et
al. 1993). By 14,500 BP the masked shrew
(Sorex cinerus/haydeni), adapted to cooler
summer temperatures, disappears from the
faunal record at Hall’s Cave. Beetle fossils
from pond sediments at the Aubrey Clovis
Site (41DN479) in North Texas (Elias 1994)
suggest a much cooler (10°C lower [18°F])
than modern average climate between 14,200
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

and 13,500 BP. By 12,500 BP the cotton rat
(Sigmodon hispidus), adapted to warm summer
temperatures, appears within the same record.
Toomey (1991, 1992) posits that at this time,
summer temperatures approached to within
3°C of contemporary values. Stable oxygen
isotope ratios from pedogenic carbonates and
freshwater marls from southern Texas provide
collaborative evidence for this warming trend
(Bousman 1990, 1992).
Soil organic carbon δ13C data from the
Richard Beene site (41BX831) in southern
Bexar County indicate that between 18,000
and 16,500 BP, temperatures were cooler by
about 5°C (9°F), and less summer rainfall
made it much drier than it is today. Conditions
such as these would have made it more
conducive for C3 plants such as cool-season
grasses, trees, tubers, and many bushy plants
to increase in density and range. During a
brief period between 16,500 and 15,800 BP,
warmer temperatures than today returned
and a significant increase in C4 plants such as
forbs and warm-season grasses predominated.
Temperatures again warmed from about
15,800 to 12,000 BP, so that they averaged
approximately 2°C (3.6°F) warmer than today.
The period between 12,000 and 10,900 BP was
one of increasing temperatures and periodic
droughts, but sufficient summer rains for the
increased production of C4 plants. Notably, the
cooling effects of the Younger Dryas detected
much farther north was not detected in the
δ13C data from Richard Beene, corroborating
other studies that indicate the Gulf of Mexico
was not affected (Nordt 2002:186). Between
10,900 and the end of the Late Pleistocene at
around 10,000 BP the temperature and rainfall
remained fairly constant, with temperature
slightly cooler than in modern times (Nordt et
al. 2002), allowing for C3 vegetative cover to
return (Thoms and Mandel 2007).
In addition to an average temperature
increase, faunal evidence suggests that
effective moisture oscillated noticeably from
14,000 to 10,500 BP (Toomey et al. 1993).
The disappearance of the bog lemming
Ecological Communications Corporation

(Synaptomys cooperi) from the record
at Hall’s Cave ca. 14,000 BP suggests a
decrease in effective moisture. A comparison
of the represented amounts of the desert
shrew (Notiosorex crawfordi), which is
more tolerant of dry conditions, to the least
shrew (Cryptotis parva), which requires
considerable moisture, at Hall’s Cave
illustrates vacillations in effective moisture
after 14,000 BP. From 12,500 to 10,500 BP,
the desert shrew increases in abundance
when compared to the least shrew, indicating
a decrease in effective moisture. After 10,500
BP, the relative numbers of the desert shrew
compared to the least shrew decreases,
indicating a return to wetter conditions. Other
species adapted to cooler, dryer climates, such
as the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus),
also disappear from the Central Texas
environmental record, further supporting a
warming/drying hypothesis (Graham 1984).
Similarly supporting faunal materials from
as far south as Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert
indicate that the geographic extent of this
warming trend reaches far beyond Central
Texas (Presley 2003:68–70).
Bolstered by a regular accumulation of
deposits that span nearly 12,000 years,
Boriack Bog provides one of the more
informative pollen sequences for the Central
Texas region (Bryant 1977). The Boriack Bog
data indicate that between 12,500 and 11,800
BP, a drier episode catalyzed a brief shift
to grasslands. Although it remains undated
by radiocarbon, Bryant (1977) observed a
similar pattern in arboreal pollen counts at
Gause Bog, and links the decline in canopy
cover with the end of the Pleistocene.
Burrowing animal species such as the prairie
dog and mole, found within cave deposits
of the region, indicate continued deep, wellweathered red soils for Central Texas during
the waning years of the Pleistocene, though
gradual erosion is indicated from deposits
at Hall’s Cave (Cooke et al. 2003; Toomey
et al. 1993). Paleoclimate models for the
region suggest continued regular, cyclonic
15

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

precipitation for the region with both tropical
and convectional storms of limited magnitude
(Toomey et al. 1993).

3.1.3 Early Holocene
(10,000–8000 BP)
At the advent of the Holocene, ca. 10,000 BP,
the pollen record at Boriack Bog evidences a
return to a woodland environment that thrives
for half a millennium. Then, sometime after
9500 BP there is a return to prominence of
open grassland communities (Bousman 1998).
Bousman hypothesizes that by 7000 BP, the
eastern margin of Central Texas was dominated
by open plant communities (Bousman
1998:211). Glen Fredlund’s (1998) phytolith
analysis involving woodland-grassland ratios
for the Wilson-Leonard site demonstrates a
similar grassland expansion that began ca. 9500
BP and lasted until ca. 4000 BP. Additionally, at
this location, there was a spike in the woodlandgrassland ratio that suggests a dramatic
grassland expansion around 8700 BP, with a
change in grassland composition from mesicadapted tall grasses to xeric-adapted short
grasses. The frequent presence of prairie dogs,
badgers, and pocket gophers in the faunal record
of the Edwards Plateau through much of the
Early Holocene correlates well with Bousman’s
(1998) and Fredlund’s (1998) interpretations of
grassland dominance (Graham 1987; Toomey
1990, 1992). Additionally, pollen deposits from
Bonfire Rockshelter also suggest increased
dominance of grassland communities in the
region (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
The faunal record at Hall’s Cave shows that
taxa associated with mesic conditions (the
eastern mole, mole salamanders, eastern shrew,
and eastern chipmunk) become locally extinct
during the Early Holocene, indicating a gradual
trend towards drier conditions (Graham 1984;
Toomey 1990, 1992; Toomey et al. 1993).
Molluscan data reported by Dale Hudler (2000)
from Winston Cave in Bexar County, along
the southern extent of the Edwards Plateau,
evidence a drying trend from 10,000 BP to 6,500
16

BP. Additionally, the presence of Promenetus
exacuous, in a column section dated to 10,000
BP, suggests an increase in mean temperature.
Like previous epochs, the prevalence of
burrowing faunal species continues to suggest
that much of the region’s uplands contained
deep, well-weathered soils that were not subject
to extensive erosion, indicating a strong plant
community (Toomey et al. 1993). Strontium
isotope analysis of floral and faunal deposits
from Hall’s Cave indicates gradual soil erosion
throughout this period.
Increased solar radiation across the northern
hemisphere coupled with continued melting
and sublimation of the massive, temperaturebuffering northern ice sheets during the Early
Holocene resulted in more dramatic variance
between seasonal temperature extremes,
with warmer summers and colder winters
than those observed in modern times. With
such temperature variation, regular, cyclonic
rains gradually gave way to intense seasonal
monsoons during summer months with
decreased precipitation during other periods of
the year (Toomey et al. 1993).

3.1.4 Middle Holocene
(8000–4000 BP)
The beginning of the Middle Holocene is often
considered the beginning of an Altithermal
(Hypsithermal) drought characterized by a
reduction in rainfall and a rise in temperatures
(Ellis et al. 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994;
Nordt 1992), with a slight respite from xeric
extremes occurring during the mid-Middle
Holocene (Collins 2004). At Boriack Bog,
the continuous recession of the woodlands
observed during the Early Holocene was
temporarily halted around 6000–5000 BP,
after which the frequency of arboreal pollen
increased, coinciding with the onset of a
wetter climate (Bousman 1994:80). Data
presented by Nordt et al. (1994) from Fort
Hood collaborate this Mid-Holocene period
(6000–4800 BP) of aridity indicated at Boriack
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Bog. In North-Central Texas, at the Aubrey
Clovis Site, Humphrey and Ferring (1994)
report evidence for the same arid period with
a duration of 6500–4000 BP. Far to the north,
in Alberta Canada, this warming trend was
noted as initiating ca. 9000 BP and lasting
to approximately 4800 BP (Holloway et al.
1981). A marked increase in eolian deposition
across the state supports conclusions of
relatively severe aridity (Toomey et al. 1993).
At Hind’s Cave, pollen records from
ca. 8700–6000 BP show that there were
significant increases in xerophytic vegetation
(Bryant and Holloway 1985). At Boriack Bog,
between 8000 BP and 7000 BP there was a
rapid transition to a grassland community
highlighted by a significant reduction in
arboreal pollen. Bousman (1998) suggests
that this shift may be a local expression of
the Altithermal event. At Boriack, there is
evidence for a brief, 500-year amelioration
of xeric extremes; at approximately 6000 BP,
there is a brief spike in frequency of arboreal
pollen, indicating a temporary increase in
effective moisture.
The archaeological record further correlates
to the suggestion of an intense drying period
during the Middle Holocene through direct
cultural action observed in many archaeological
sites. At the Mustang Springs site in western
Central Texas, which exhibits intentionally dug
wells at the site beginning at approximately
6800 BP, while similar wells are found at other
sites in the region (Toomey et al. 1993).
The xeric conditions that were so pervasive
during the Middle Holocene significantly
controlled patterns of erosion and stability
within the river valleys of Central Texas.
Downcutting was prevalent and, as a
consequence, left former valley floors high
above the flood plain. For large amounts of
time, these stable surfaces remained uncapped
by deposition, creating palimpsests of great
duration (Collins 2004). Secondary deposits
observed in various caves in Texas indicate that
upland landforms, subject to gradual, steady
Ecological Communications Corporation

erosion, downwasting, and dissection over the
previous millennia, essentially were exhausted
of available soils sometime between 8000 and
4000 BP, with modern conditions in uplands
in place by the end of the Middle Holocene
(Cooke et al. 2003; Toomey et al. 1993). Such
extensive erosion and downwasting of uplands
is most likely a primary reason for a general
lack of sites and an overall reduction in site
preservation in uplands throughout the region,
rather than an indication of cultural preference.
Marsh pollen deposits collected during recent
excavations at the Davis Spring Branch Site
(41WM989) in southern Williamson County
support indications that the Altithermal may
not have been as pervasive and universal across
the region as some sites suggest, particularly
along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau
(Johnson 1995; Karbula et al. 2007). Pollen
deposits from 41WM989 at this period (8000–
5000 BP) were almost entirely arboreal with
minimal grassland species. Further analysis
of the Davis Spring marsh itself indicated
that, at least at the site, water never ceased to
flow, indicating abundant moisture. The site
was densely wooded and likely conditions
were much more mesic than the other locales
discussed above. Mesic conditions, however,
transitioned at the site to sub-mesic to slightly
xeric beginning at approximately 5000 BP
(Karbula et al. 2007:294–301). Phytolith
analysis of sediments from the Choke Canyon
project (Robinson 1982:597–610) adds to the
claim of considerable climatic variability.
Between 5300 and 4300 BP, Robinson
(1982:598) infers a cool, mesic climatic
regime that shifts to a more arid period, and
then returns to conditions both cooler and
wetter than today’s by 3250 BP. Finally, carbon
isotope analysis of snail shells from West
Texas’ Hinds Cave indicates generally moist
conditions for much of the Middle Holocene
(Goodfriend and Ellis 2000:57).
With increased temperatures and strong
influence from a larger and warmer Gulf of
Mexico, the majority of regional precipitation
would have been monsoon rains during
17

Chapter 3

summer months with particularly intense
convective storms encountered during the
same periods. Tropical storms, previously
uncommon for the region, would have been
more common through portions of Texas
(Toomey et al. 1993).

3.1.5 Late Holocene (ca. 4000
BP–Present Day)
The beginning of the Late Holocene period is
characterized by the culmination of the gradual
decrease in effective moisture, marking it as
the driest in the last 20,000 years (Toomey et
al. 1993). Within the Hall’s Cave faunal record,
at this time there is a disappearance of the
eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus)
and the woodland vole (Microtus pinetorium).
In addition, reflecting the height of xeric
conditions, the represented numbers of the least
shrew, Cryptotis, reaches its nadir. At Shulze
Cave, in strata dated with a radiocarbon age of
ca. 3800 BP, the desert shrew is represented in
large numbers, while the least shrew is absent
(Dalquest et al. 1969). Bement (1991) reports
that the record of terrestrial gastropods at
Bering Sinkhole from ca. 4000 to 2500 BP is an
indicator that effective moisture was minimal.
Starting at approximately 3,000 BP, grass
and oak pollen are equally represented in the
Weakly Bog sequence. The pollen frequencies
signify that communities of oak woodland
were replaced by communities of oak-hickory
woodland. In contradiction to an interpretation
by Holloway et al. (1987), Bousman (1998)
concludes this change signals a shift towards
a progressively moister climate. Phytolith data
from Wilson-Leonard indicate that sometime
after 2000 BP, there was a regional re-expansion
of woodlands (Fredlund 1998).
At the Davis Spring Branch Site, marsh pollen
transitions sharply from dense woodland
canopy before 5000 BP to open grasslands,
which predominate until approximately 1500
BP, when woodlands again take hold (Karbula
et al. 2007). Similar trends are noted from
18

climatic data at the Richard Beene Site in Bexar
County. Soil organic carbon data (δ13C) suggest
that the hot and dry period that prevailed
during the Middle Holocene continued until
around 1500 BP. A cooling trend then began
and lasted for about 1,000 years, to about 500
BP. Warm-season grasses and forbs waned in
abundance, and with the exception of a possible
slight interruption around 500 BP, cool-season
grasses, trees, and tubers once again began to
take root (Thoms and Mandel 2007).
Sometime between 2500 and 1000 BP, the
woodland vole and eastern pipistrelle bat
reappear in the faunal record at Hall’s Cave,
indicating a return to more mesic conditions
(Toomey et al. 1993). Pollen and land snail data
from south-central Oklahoma conform to this
model, suggesting that the shift towards mesic
conditions may have occurred between 2500
and 2000 BP (Hall 1998). Data from the Gulf
Coast tend to suggest more mesic conditions in
the Late Holocene. Ricklis and Cox’s (1998)
study of oyster-growth patterns on the Texas
Gulf coast tentatively implies a shift to a cooler
climate at ca. 3000 BP, emerging out of a much
warmer Middle Holocene.
Excavations along North Texas’ Denton
Creek (41DL270) provides indications
of brief fluctuations of climate at the site
beginning some time between 2250 and 1400
BP. Archaeologists noted a direct, inverse
relationship between large mammal bone
fragments (considered by the authors to be
high-priority food sources) to aquatic, avian,
and reptilian resources (considered lowerpreference food sources and likely indicators
of food stress). Deer are in abundance from
2250 BP until a marked, distinct drop at
approximately 1400 BP, which corresponds
to increases in turtle, bird, and mussel shell
quantities. This drop transitions again back to
deer dominance shortly thereafter (Anthony
and Brown, eds. 1994). Higher isotope values
occurring in mussel shells from dated contexts
suggests a cool and wet climate around 3500
BP, a warm, dry climate around 2850 BP,
then a cooling off and the climate becoming

wetter between 2500 and 1500 BP, and finally
a warming trend occurring after 1500 BP
(Brown 1998:164).

As defined by Prewitt (1981a) and later
modified by Hester (1989a), the Central Texas
archaeological region encompasses an area that
is nearly 84,300 km2. The core of the Central
Texas archaeological region is the Edwards
Plateau (Hester 1989a). This region extends
from the city of Uvalde northwestward to
Sonora and from there northward to just beyond
Paint Rock. Moving northeast from Paint Rock,
the city of Cleburne marks the northern-most
point of the Central Texas archaeological
region. From here, the area extends southeast,
beyond Waco into the Blackland Prairie and
further south to just north of Floresville (Figure
3-2). Like most other archaeological regions,
the boundaries for the Central Texas region
are ephemeral, subject to reinterpretation as
more and more work is done. No matter its
boundaries, at the core of the Central Texas
Archaeological region is the Edwards Plateau
(Hester 1989a).

At Wilson-Leonard, the modern balance of
woodlands and grasslands seems to have
reached levels of modern balance during
the Late Holocene. From 4000 BP on, the
vegetation composition is similar to modern
leaf-litter assemblages from Central Texas
woodlands, with identifiable arboreal taxa
including oaks, elms, and hackberry (Fredlund
1998). Locally, the data suggest that after
2000 BP, the Wilson-Leonard locale saw an
increase in the amount of canopy cover within
the site’s vicinity.
Toward the end of the Late Holocene,
the pollen and faunal indicators become
incongruous for Central Texas. This may be
reflective of a strong west-to-east trend that
grades from the xeric to the mesic. It may
also be an indication of relatively significant
variability of weather conditions. Along
the southwestern margins of the Edwards
Plateau, the absence of pronghorn
antelope (Antilocarpa Americana)
in the faunal remains is a good
indicator that semi-desert scrub
prevailed there (Toomey 1993).
At Hall’s Cave, the faunal record
include taxa that are indicative of
short grass environments. Along
the eastern edge of the Plateau,
the presence of Antilocarpa sp.
at the Wunderlich Site suggests
El Paso
that mixed grasslands prevailed
along the Balcones Escarpment
(Graham 1987).

3.2.1 Prehistoric Chronology

Mesoamerica, where changes in technology
and style are apparent in ceramics, and the
Southern High Plains complexes that are
defined more so by shifts in climatic conditions
and subsistence than by changes in point style,
lithic technology usually serves as the marker
of change in South-Central Texas. While a
chronology based on projectile point typology
is limiting in that it implicitly creates static
demarcations in both literature and in practice
of what is conceptually fluid, other avenues are
hampered by the paucity of data. When dealing
with the temporal vastness of prehistory most
data are material, and of this material, none
remains in the Texas archaeological record in
greater numbers than stone tools.

Several scholars have offered sound but
differing arguments for cultural chronologies
for Central Texas (Figures 3-3 and 3-4). Using
the earlier works of Suhm et al. (1954), Johnson
et al. (1962), and Sorrow et al. (1967) as a
springboard, Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981a,
1985) sorted through the archaeological
data from Central Texas and established a
chronology defined by phases. Although some
of their data has been criticized as unreliable
chronological markers and intervals (e.g.
Collins 1995; Johnson 1987), they energized
colleagues to investigate empirical methods
for inferring cultural behavior. Black (1989a,
1989b) synthesized the data of high-quality
sites available at the time in South and Central
Texas, and offered a synthesis of prehistoric
intervals that was widely accepted. Collins
(1995) reviewed the archaeological and
palynological evidence for Central Texas, and
offered new chronological estimates for human
occupation from the Paleoindian through
Historic periods. Johnson and Goode (1994)
accomplished the same for the Eastern Edwards
Plateau. Unlike the American Southwest and

BP), Cactus Hill (15,000 BP), Topper (13,000
BP), Clovis (11,800 BP) and Daisy Cave (10,500
BP) (Marshall 2001). In South America, sites
with claims to pre-Clovis cultural components
include Pedra Furada and Serra Da Capivara in
Brazil, Taima-Taima in Venezuela, and Monte
Verde in Chile (Dillehay 1989, 1997, 2000).
None of the sites are without their detractors.
Criticisms include questionable stratigraphy
and dates. Two of these sites, Meadowcroft
Rockshelter and Monte Verde, have seemingly
stood up to the scrutiny.
Although humans may have inhabited North
America before 11,500 BP, solid evidence
does not as of yet support their existence. The
argument that artifacts recovered from Levi
Rockshelter in Travis County are older than
Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133–145) is not
supported because the radiocarbon dates from
this site are not clustered, and there are no
distinct artifact and extinct faunal assemblages
within well-defined stratigraphy (Collins
1995:380–381). Other sites where assemblages
are purportedly pre-Clovis include Friesenhahn
Cave (Krieger 1964) and the Waco Mammoth
Site (Fox et al. 1992). Human behavior is
inferred on stone artifacts from Friesenhahn
Cave and mammoth bones at the Waco Site.
However, problems of context or dating exist at
both sites (Collins 1995:380–381). The Gault
Site in Bell County, Texas, has provided by far
the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North
America, and with artifacts stratigraphically
beneath the known Clovis component, likely
has the best chances of providing conclusive
evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas
(Adavasio and Page 2002:292–294; Collins
2002; Collins and Brown 2000).
While Clovis Paleoindian occupations in
Texas are well documented and dated, claims
for pre-Clovis sites in Texas have been few,
and when claims have been made, they often
lack credibility (Collins 2004). The absence of
credible pre-Clovis sites in Texas can largely
be attributed to the absence of preserved
geological deposits that date between 18,000
and 12,000 years ago (Bousman and Skinner
22

2007). In Texas, valley alluvial deposits were
affected by widespread erosion that occurred
13,000–12,000 years ago. This severely affects
the possibility of locating pre-Clovis deposits
in fluvial contexts (Collins 2004). Upland
landforms often provide poor stratigraphic
context, while rock shelters of great age are
often greatly degraded. Evidence for pre-Clovis
occupations would thus be incredibly rare and
difficult to find except in specific depositional
contexts.
One such geographical area within Texas that
does exhibit intact Late Pleistocene sediments is
the North Sulphur River valley (Rainey 1974).
Work done by Mary Rainey indicates that two
distinct episodes of degradation-aggradation
occurred during the Late Pleistocene. Rainey
divides these formations into the Upper
Sulphur River Formation and Lower Sulphur
River Formation. Fortuitously, these alluvial
deposits are separated from the Holocene by
a lens of truncated soil, making distinction
between the two easy. Undisturbed Quaternary
deposits dating to nearly 17,000 years ago
exist within the North Sulphur River Valley
(Bousman and Skinner 2007). In May and
August of 2005, the North Sulphur River was
examined by Bousman and Skinner to test for
the possibility of in situ Paleoindian artifacts.
Ten cutbank and backhoe trench profiles were
investigated and field reconnaissance of the
river valley was conducted. While amplifying
what was known on the chronological scheme
for alluvial deposits of the North Sulphur River,
the contestable context of the limited number
of artifacts recovered has left the possibility of
a pre-Clovis occupation in Texas just that: still
an unconfirmed possibility.
One such possibility is the Petronila Creek site
(41NU246) located near the town of Driscoll,
30 km west of Corpus Christi and the southern
Texas coast. Discovered here in a cutbank
exposure 5 m below the modern ground surface
was a mixed accumulation of faunal bone
that has been radiocarbon dated to ca. 18,000
years ago (Lewis 2009). This date is supported

by stratigraphical, climatological, and faunal
correlations.
This bone bed is a primary deposit of multiple
elements of many different individual animals
(an adult mammoth, a gar, a large turtle, a
mylodont sloth). Mostly through a process
of elimination, Lewis (2009) arrives at the
conclusion that humans were responsible for
the accumulation of the bone pile. In support
of this conclusion are cut marks on some of
the bone and evidence that suggests some
of the bones were used as tools. Chert flakes
found within the bone-bed sand were further
evidence of a human causality for the bone
bed. Additionally, located within creek bed
sediments adjacent to the bone bed were two
unclassified projectile point fragments (Lewis
2009). Still, the bulk of the evidence for a preClovis context occupation at Petronila Creek
is, at best, a priori and much more work needs
to be done before anything definitive can be
assumed.

3.2.3 Paleoindian
Scholars divide the Paleoindian period for
North America by epoch. Pleistocene-era
peoples that inhabited North America from
ca. 12,000 to 10,000 BP are referred to as
Early Paleoindian (Collins 1995, 2004).
The advent of the Holocene is the arbitrary
temporal demarcation between Early and Late
Paleoindian periods. The people of the Early
Holocene (10,000–8000 BP) period utilized
a similar lanceolate point technology and
practiced lifestyles that were in many ways
the same as the Early Paleoindian period.
Most Paleoindian finds in Central Texas
have consisted of surface lithic scatters on
upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989a:25,
1989b:48). A few Paleoindian components
deeply buried in alluvium have been
discovered, such as Berclair Terrace (Sellards
1940), Berger Bluff (Brown 1987), Kincaid
Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989), WilsonLeonard (Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1993),
and at recent excavations of the Richard
Ecological Communications Corporation

Beene site (Thoms and Mandel 2007; Thoms
et al. 1996). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes
three sites that have high-integrity Paleoindian
components resting on stable landforms:
Kincaid Rockshelter, Horn Shelter No. 2, and
Wilson-Leonard. Many Paleoindian points
have been recovered from surface contexts
in Bexar and nearby counties (Chandler and
Hindes 1993; Hester 1968a, 1968b; Howard
1974; Nickels, Leach, Tomka, and Moses
1997). A Late Paleoindian component, with
apparent moderate integrity, has also been
reported at the St. Mary’s Hall site in Bexar
County (Hester 1990:14–17, 1995:435).
Diagnostic artifacts for the Early Paleoindian
period include lanceolate-shaped, fluted
projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, and
Plainview. Certainly, the wide distribution
of Clovis-type points across most of North
America and even into Central America
suggests a wide dispersal and interaction of the
people who made them (Kelly 1993; Wenke
1990:201). Within Texas’s political boundaries,
Bever and Meltzer (2007) have documented
the presence of 544 Clovis points in 149 of
254 counties. In the Central Texas region, the
distribution of Clovis points generally follows
the Balcones Escarpment, where high-quality
chert is available within an ecotone of natural
subsistence resources. However, south of the
Edwards Plateau, fewer-than-expected Clovis
points have been documented, and increasingly
so from the escarpment southward. Four Clovis
points have been documented from Bexar
County. Other artifacts associated with the
Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic
blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points,
stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials
(Collins 1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–436).
A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom
artifacts are fairly common in Central and
South Texas; however, no campsites or
killsites with Folsom components have been
found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real
(41BX52), in Bexar County (Collins et al. 2003;
23

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

Hester 1995:434–435). Along with chipped
stone artifact assemblages characterized by
Clovis and Folsom lanceolate points, artifact
assemblages for Early Paleoindian peoples
in Central Texas include engraved stones,
exotic lithic materials such as obsidian, and
ochre-stained artifacts (Collins et al. 1991).
These projectile points were utilized as tips on
atlatls and were used to hunt big game such as
mammoth, mastodon, bison, horse, and camel
(Black 1989a). During the Paleoindian period,
a hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy was
employed with an increase in harvesting flora
and hunting small game as big game died off
towards the end of the Pleistocene.
The shift from the Early to the Late
Paleoindian subperiod is marked by the
appearance of several unfluted projectile
point styles such as the Dalton and San Patrice
types and Plainview-like points, which are
similar to Plainview points but differ in
flaking technology and are noticeably thicker
through the midsection (Collins 2004).
Diagnostic artifacts of the Late Paleoindian
include lanceolate forms such as Angostura,
Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber,
and early stemmed points (e.g., Wilson)
then appearing. The appearance of Wilson,
Golondrina, and Saint Mary’s Hall point
types postdate Dalton and San Patrice types
(Collins 2004).

big-game hunters following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna (e.g., mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse) across North America
(Black 1989a), more recent discoveries have
emphasized the wide diversity of plants and
animals used for subsistence by these early
Americans (Black 1989a; Hester 1983). In
addition to bison and deer, smaller animals
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons were eaten (Collins
1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted
the large animals as well (Dibble and Lorraine
1968). The mistaken conception that human
hunters caused the demise of the now-extinct
megafauna has essentially been debunked
(see for example, Cannon and Meltzer 2004;
Grayson and Meltzer 2002).
The transition from the Paleoindian period
to the Archaic is marked by a warming of
the climate. As the warming that marks the
transition from Pleistocene to Holocene
climates began to take effect in Texas,
prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes
in lifestyle. New evidence is reshaping longheld stances that cultures dating to Paleoindian
times practiced exclusively a nomadic lifestyle
characterized by a reliance on the hunting of
big game. We know now that adaptations were
more varied and exploitive. This climatic shift
is also marked by the decline and extinction of
mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant
bison (Bison antiquus). With the possible
exception of Berclair Terrace (although not
dated; Sellards 1940), archaeological evidence
suggests that after 8000 BP, large gregarious
game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas.
Human hunters were forced to concentrate
on deer, antelope, and other medium-sized
or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence
base required technological shifts that mark
the beginning of a new cultural period known
as the Archaic.

It has been suggested that the morphology of
Plainview points (parallel-sided, thin convex
surfaces, ground down edges form base to
midpoint or beyond) indicates that they were
deeply set in socketed halves to be used as
projectiles to kill large animals, such as bison
(Kelly 1982). In contrast, Golondrina points,
hafted in split-stem style, appear to be best
utilized in hunting medium-sized game, such
as deer or antelope. Kay’s (1998) use-wear
analysis of Golondrina points from the WilsonLeonard Site illustrates that Golondrina points
were also used as butchering tools.

3.2.4 Early Archaic

Although the Paleoindian adaptation had been
considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,

Dates for the Archaic period in Central Texas
are from 8800 to 1200 BP (Collins 2004;

24

City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Johnson and Goode 1994). Material culture
became more diverse with the increased
exploitation of diverse flora evidenced by
the use of burned rock middens. During the
Archaic the generalized hunting and gathering
pattern of the Paleoindian period persisted,
with reliance on local resources intensifying
(Collins 2004:119). Both Collins (2004) and
Johnson and Goode (1994) divide the Archaic
into Early, Middle, and Late sub-periods.
Collins (1995:383) dates the Early Archaic
from 8800 to 6000 BP in Central Texas, with
three divisions, or intervals based on projectile
point types. Sites within or near Central Texas
with Early Archaic components include the
Youngsport site located in Bell County (Shafer
1963), Wilson-Leonard, Sleeper, Jetta Court,
Camp Pearl Wheat, Landslide, Loeve-Fox,
Richard Beene (Thoms et al. 1996), the Tee Box
Six Site, as well as several located on Camp
Bullis in northern Bexar County (Gerstle et al.
1978), and at Choke Canyon (Hall et al. 1986).
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early
Archaic with Early Corner-Notched and Early
Basal-Notched dart points, roughly dating the
period to 7950–4450 BP. Both Johnson (1991)
and Prikryl (1990) see Early Archaic points as
representative of two broad styles, the Early
Barbed and the Early Split-Stem traditions.
Johnson notes (1995:85) that these traditions
“did not obviously develop from the region’s
Paleoindian points” and that Archaic peoples
knapped in an “Archaic as opposed to a
Paleoindian mode.” Like the Clovis tradition,
the Early Split-Stem style was widespread
across the North American continent. Fiedel
(1992) notes these point types range east into
Alabama, up to West Virginia and into New
York. Additionally, Early Split-Stem points
are found throughout the American West,
where they are most commonly referred to as
Pinto points. Once dated to the Paleoindian
period, some of the first signatures of the
Early Archaic are unstemmed dart points such
as Angostura (Collins 1995). By about 8000
BP these unstemmed points loose prominence
to stemmed varieties such as Gower, Hoxie,
Ecological Communications Corporation

Jetta, Martindale, and Uvalde (Black 1989a;
Collins 1995).
Also prevalent during the Early Archaic were
Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, specialized
woodworking tools (Collins 1995) and Clear
Fork gouges (Turner and Hester 1999).
Notched stones appear in assemblages; their
use is often posited as bola stones or as fishing
net weights (Boyd and Shafer 1997), although
some speculate that such stones may have been
purely decorative or ceremonial (Chandler
1999). Certain sites along the Plateau exhibit
quantities and concentrations of stone that
were used as heating elements and reflect a
technology centered on exploiting the oaksavanna resource base (Collins 2004). Collins
(2004) surmises, with little argument, that these
artifact clusters were the antecedents of the
large burned rock middens that come later.
Common site types during the Early Archaic
were open campsites and rock shelters. Several
authors note that within Central Texas, the
majority of these sites are distributed along the
eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau (Black 1989a; Ellis 1994; Johnson 1991;
Johnson and Goode 1994; McKinney 1981).
Collins (1995) notes that the site distribution
data to date reflect that Early Archaic peoples
were living in the better-watered areas of the
live-oak savanna habitats on the Plateau, where
there was a more diverse resource base. Both
McKinney (1981) and Story (1985) suggest that
this concentration may have been an adaptive
response to an arid climatic interval.
Weir (1976) speculates that population density
during the Early Archaic was low and that hunter
and gatherer groups were small and highly
mobile. This inference was based on the fact
that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic projectile point types are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas
and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes
that population densities were low during the
Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of
related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39).
25

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

Their economy was based on the utilization of
a wide range of resources, especially such yearround resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story
1985:38). Within the live-oak savanna of
Central Texas certain geophytes (wild onions,
prairie turnips), nuts such as pecan and walnut,
berries, fruits, and grass seeds would round out
and diversify this subsistence base.
Human skeletal material recovered from Bering
Sinkhole (41KR241) in Kerr County dated to
6708–7676 BP indicates a low rate of human
tooth-enamel hypoplasia with a relatively low
rate of caries, suggesting that there was little
weaning stress and a diet low in carbohydrates
(Turpin 1985). Ratios for stable carbon
isotopes show that there was a low reliance on
C3 plants such as sotol and acorns, both widely
available in this area at this time (Bement 1994;
Bousman and Quigg 2006). Instead, it appears
that there was a greater reliance on C4 of CAM
plants (Bement 1994). Burial arrangements
at the Mason Ranch Burial Cave (41UV4)
would seem to imply that by the Early Archaic
period, time was invested in the placement of
individual interments by a group of people who
would have had to plan and coordinate descents
into the near unscalable vertical shaft.

3.2.5 Middle Archaic
Collins (1995:383) defines this intermediate
interval of the Archaic as lasting from
about 6000 to 4000 BP in Central Texas.
Representative sites of the Texas Middle
Archaic include the Landslide, Wounded Eye,
Gibson, and Panther Springs sites (Collins
1995). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes
only one site in Central Texas that has a
high-integrity Middle Archaic component
resting on a stable landform: Landslide. The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time
of increased population, based on the large
number of documented sites from this period
in South and Central Texas (Story 1985:40;
Weir 1976:125, 128). By midway through the
Middle Archaic period, ca. 5000 BP, burned
26

rock middens and earth ovens were in use
(Johnson and Goode 1994).
The reasons for the population increase during
the Middle Archaic are not wholly known, but
the amelioration of a very dry Early Archaic
period (Altithermal) is often seen as the prime
mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). Weir (1976:124–127) suggests
that as the climate became less moist, deer
and acorn thrived in Central Texas, attracting
groups from all other regions of Texas, at least
seasonally. McKinney (1981:114) suggests
that as the climate became drier, groups from
other regions used to arid conditions, would
have moved into the Central Texas Hill
Country. The end of the Middle Archaic may
have been the most xeric conditions witnessed
by man in Central Texas (Collins 1995). This
climate change was accompanied by a change
in technology as Nolan and Travis points first
appeared (Collins 1995).
Both Collins (2004) and Johnson (Johnson
and Goode 1994) identify the Andice/Bell
projectile types, also known as Calf Creek
points, as the first dart-point styles of the
Middle Archaic. Johnson (Johnson and
Goode 1994:25) believes that this point style
represents an intrusion into the region by
peoples from the Eastern Woodlands margin
of northeast Texas and southern Oklahoma,
who came into the region to hunt bison that
were returning to the area in greater numbers.
Within Central Texas, Andice/Bell point
types have been found in association with
bison bone at the Landslide Site (41BL85)
and the Cervenka Site (41WM267) (Sorrow
et al. 1967; Peter et al. 1982). Other point
style intervals for the Middle Archaic are
the Taylor and Nolan-Travis intervals. An
unnotched triangular point, the Taylor point
style is similar to the Andice-Bell-Calf Creek
types. Both types are thin-bladed forms with
long thinning flakes emanating bifacially from
the base (Collins 2004). Collins (2004:120)
notes that these forms would “serve equally
well as knives or as tips of lances, spears, or
darts.” Johnson (Johnson and Goode 1994)
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

suggests that these thin forms were initially
part of a specialized bison hunting toolkit.
A technological shift is noted in the NolanTravis interval. Comparatively, their blades
are thick and often narrow with stems and
shoulders without the deep basal notching
seen in Andice-Bell-Calf Creek points (Collins
1995). The stems of Travis points are usually
rectangular with parallel edges, while Nolan
points have steep, alternate beveling along
stem edges (Turner and Hester 1999). A wide
variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas
Terrace site suggests “a time of ethnic and
cultural variety, as well as group movement
and immigration” (Johnson 1995:285).
On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of
widely scattered, year-round resources such
as prickly pear continued (Campbell and
Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer
and rabbit. Stable nitrogen values taken from
human remains at Bering Sinkhole suggest
that plant consumption increased from the
Early Archaic to the Middle Archaic, while
meat consumption decreased (Bement 1994).
In Central Texas there is a shift from a C4
and CAM plant-dominant diet to one with an
increased reliance on C3 grasses (Bousman and
Quigg 2006). A shift to concentrated, seasonal
nut harvests in the riverine environments of the
Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred
(Black 1989a; Hall 1998). Weir (1976) believes
that an expansion of oak on the Edwards
Plateau and Balcones Escarpment led to
intensive plant gathering and acorn processing.
He also believes that the widely scattered bands
prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to
coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering
season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the
acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126).
Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of these acorn-gathering and
processing endeavors (Creel 1986; Prewitt
1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (Black et al. 1998; Goode
1991), but the exact processes that formed
the burned rock middens are still a matter of
Ecological Communications Corporation

controversy (e.g., Black et al. 1997; Leach and
Bousman 1998; Mauldin et al. 2003). While
exact function remains debatable, large burned
rock middens debuted sometime between
the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek and Taylor style
intervals. The appearance of these features
appears to coincide with what Collins (1995)
notes is the onset of extreme xeric conditions.
The common presence of deer remains in
burned rock middens encourages the view
that deer processing took place at burned rock
midden sites (Nickels et al. 1998; Black and
McGraw 1985:278; Weir 1976:125). There
has been a tendency to equate presence of
burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981a); however, examinations
of several recent faunal reports show that
after about 4500 BP, bison and burned rock
middens are contemporaneous, at least in the
southern Edwards Plateau and northern South
Texas Plain (Meissner 1993). Bison bone is
encountered in archaeological sites in Central
and South Texas, at least occasionally, during
all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974).

3.2.6 Late Archaic
Collins (1995:384) dates the final period of
the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4000–1300 BP. The Late Archaic is
characterized by a gradual shift from a period
that was extremely xeric to one that was, by
comparison, a great deal more mesic (Collins
2004:121). Some distinctive material traits of
the Late Archaic in Central Texas are a high
diversity in projectile point styles, cornertanged knives, and cylindrical stone pipes
(Collins 2004:121). Although inhabitants
of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville
and Rockport had begun to make pottery by
about 1750 BP, the northern part of the plain
was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years later
(Story 1985:45–47). Save for the advent of
the Late Archaic, during the Bulverde style
interval, the Late Archaic is well represented
by investigated sites, many in good stratified
27

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

contexts (Collins 2004:121). Representative
sites of the Central Texas Late Archaic include
the Loeve Fox, Beaver Head, and and the Bessie
Kruse site (Collins 1995). Collins (1995:Table
2) recognizes three sites within Central Texas
with high-integrity Late Archaic components
resting on stable landforms: Anthon, LoeveFox, and 41TG91.
Collins proposes six dart-point style intervals for
the Late Archaic; from earliest to most recent,
they are Bulverde, Pedernales, Lange, Marshall,
Montell, Marcos, Ensor, and Darl (Collins
2004:113). Late Archaic points tend to be much
smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most
common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner and
Hester 1999:114,122), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio
point also has a notched base (Turner and Hester
1999:122). In addition to diverse dart point
styles, Late Archaic artifacts include cornertanged knives, cylindrical stone pipes, and
marine shell ornaments. Caches of large bifaces
occur, and burned rock middens continue as
a site type, particularly prominent during the
Pedernales style interval (Collins 2004).
Based on changes in projectile point styles,
changing environmental conditions, and the
influx of religious and social influences from
eastern North America, Johnson (Johnson and
Goode 1994) subdivides the Late Archaic
in Central Texas into two sub-periods: Late
Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The former is
identified with Bulverde dart points, a style
that appears in Central Texas during a period of
climate stress (Johnson and Goode 1994:29).
Johnson suggests that, like the Bell/Andice/
Calf Creek point style, the Bulverde tradition
may have been brought in from the prairies
of northern or northeastern Texas (Johnson
and Goode 1994). Hedocuments a similarity
in both manufacture and styling between the
Pedernales and Montell dart point types and
their associated assemblages (Johnson and
Goode 1994). Johnson offers that during the
Late Archaic I sub-period that the eastern
Plateau may have been occupied by a single
and united group, and that the Pedernales
28

point was developed locally (Johnson and
Goode 1994:29–30).
Evidence indicates that during the Late
Archaic, burned rock cooking continued to
be utilized as a subsistence strategy, and that
the “growth of burned rock middens was at
its greatest during the second quarter of the
Late Archaic, ca. 3200–2500 BP. Within the
Central Texas region, it is the eastern extent
that best evidences this” (Collins 2004:121).
After 2500 BP, with a mesic-induced decline
in xeric vegetation, the use and size of burned
rock middens declined. In the eastern parts of
Central Texas, a drop-off in xeric vegetation is
correlated with a decreased use of burned rock
middens from 3500 BP to 2500 BP (Black et al.
1997). In the western reaches of Central Texas,
where more xeric conditions prevailed, earth
ovens were continuously used into the Late
Prehistoric period (Black et al. 1997; Goode
1991). Subsistence is assumed to have become
less specialized on acorns in favor of a broad
spectrum subsistence base (Black 1989a:30).
By about 1450 BP, bison had again declined in
numbers (Dillehay 1974). Bement (1991) notes
that during the Late Archaic, there may have
been an increase in carbohydrate consumption,
which may have come in the way of sugars
produced during baking of sotol leaves.
Some researchers believe populations
increased throughout the Late Archaic (e.g.,
Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations
remained the same or fell during this period
(Black 1989a:30). Story (1985:44–45)
believes the presence of cemeteries at sites
such as Ernest Witte in Austin County (Hall
1981), Hitzfelder Cave in Bexar County
(Givens 1968a, 1968b), and Olmos Dam, also
in Bexar County (Lukowski 1988), is evidence
that Late Archaic populations in Central Texas
were increasing. Additionally, Story posits
that these cemeteries indicate that indigenous
groups were becoming more territorial at this
time compared to the Middle Archaic. Others
connect these cemeteries with increased
sedentism, trade, and exchange (Black 1989a).

3.2.7 Late Prehistoric
The term “Late Prehistoric” designates
the period following the Late Archaic in
Central and South Texas. Generally, the Late
Prehistoric period is thought to span AD
700–1530 (Collins 1995; Hester 1995). Collins
(1995:385) recognizes that the commonly used
date of 1200 BP for the end of the Archaic and
beginning of the Late Prehistoric in Central
Texas is arbitrary, and Hester (1995:442)
acknowledges the problematic issue of selected
tools appearing at both Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric sites. A series of distinctive traits
marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric period, including the technological
shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction
of pottery to Central Texas and the northern
South Texas Plain (Black 1989a:32; Story
1985:45–47). Most researchers agree the early
Late Prehistoric period was a time of population
decrease in Central Texas (Black 1989a:32).
Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah.

Austin Phase
During the Austin phase, there appears to be
a subtle transition away from expanding-stem
projectile points that may have been used as
dart points as well as early arrow points (e.g.
Edwards point). The most prevalent point
found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Though small burned rock middens
associated with Scallorn and Edwards points
have been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and
Lohse 1993:193–248), they are rare. Settlement
shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave
in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and
Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County
(Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer
1977; Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this
period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black
1989a:32). For example, an excavation of a
burial just north of San Antonio (41BX952)
revealed an Edwards point between two lumbar
vertebra (Meissner 1991), and six human
skeletons were exhumed from the Leove-Fox
site in Williamson County “with arrow points
Ecological Communications Corporation

(all of the Scallorn type) in such a manner as to
suggest that the penetration of projectiles was
the cause of death” (Prewitt 1974:46, 1981b).
Nearby sites from the Austin phase include
Quinta Medina (Guderjan et al. 1992, 1993)
and Panther Springs Creek, 41BX228 (Black
and McGraw 1985). Collins (1995:Table 2)
recognizes eight Central Texas sites with highintegrity Late Prehistoric components resting
on stable landforms: Loeve-Fox, Frisch Auf!,
Smith, Rush, Mustang Branch, Rocky Branch
B, and Currie.

Toyah Phase
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 BP,
a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz
arrow point may best represent the appearance
of a distinct culture in South-Central Texas,
which lasted for about 300 years and
archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase.
Hester (1995:444) recognizes this phase
as the “best documented Late Prehistoric
pattern” throughout South Texas, with dates
ranging from ca. 650/700 to 300/350 BP (AD
1250/1300 to 1600/1650). The Toyah phase
is characterized by the introduction of blade
technology, the first ceramics in Central Texas
(bone-tempered plain wares), alternatelybeveled bifaces, and a shift from an expandingstem point type to the narrow, contracting-stem
Perdiz (Black 1989a:32; Huebner 1991:346).
Apparently intrusive arrow points in Toyah
assemblages include Fresno points from the
North Texas area.
In the late 1940s, J. C. Kelley (1947a, 1947b)
identified the Perdiz arrow point with what he
termed the Toyah foci. Six years later, Jelks
(1953) demonstrated that in general, Austinfoci Scallorn were found underlying Toyahfoci Perdiz and Cliffton arrow points in the
Blum Rockshelter. A few years after that, Suhm
(1957) confirmed the predominance of Perdiz
and Cliffton points as characteristic of the
Toyah assemblage, vertically positioned over
Austin foci Scallorn points. Prewitt (1985)
and Black (1989a) suggest this technology
encroached from North-Central Texas.

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

Patterson (1988), however, notes the Perdiz
point was first seen in Southeast Texas by
about 1350 BP, and was introduced to the west
some 600–700 years later. Johnson (1994a)
suggests that the Perdiz point seems to have
had its origin along the western periphery of
the Edwards Plateau, and perhaps its advanced
technology spread quickly.
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a
Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered
pottery, bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone
endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently
utilized flakes. Jelks’ Toyah traits include:
Perdiz and Cliffton arrow points, doublepointed and beveled knives, gravers, small
drills, stone side-scrapers, expedient scrapers,
crude bifaces, bison bone scrapers, deer bone
spatulates, bone awls, Leon Plain and possibly
intrusive pottery, ground stone, hematite
pigment, worked mussel shells, smoothed
antler tines, pendants, tubular bone beads,
fishhooks, and needles, along with perishable
wood and grass/mat items (Jelks 1962:86–90).
Johnson (1994a) argues that the beveled knives
and blades seen in South-Central Texas are the
same as those seen in the archaeological record
in western Oklahoma and Kansas, and may
temporally precede Toyah deposits in Texas.
Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomenon indicative of increased sedentism,
and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
This technology involves removing flakes from
a core in a nonstandard manner; the purpose
is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate
use, selecting the ones that best suit the need
at the time. This technology differs from
formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacture of formal, usually bifacial tools.
Bone-tempered pottery with stick-brushed
exteriors is considered diagnostic to Toyah,
although intrusive wares are also present.
Sometimes found are asphaltum-coated sherds,
a Karankawan, Texas Gulf Coast tradition.
Some of the vessels found at Toyah sites are
identical in decoration to Northeast Texas
Caddoan vessels. Others show a Jornada
Mogollon influence, particularly ollas, while
30

others appear very similar to the Los Angeles
type found in Sierra de Tamalipas. In many
cases, the jars found at Toyah sites contain
residue, presumably from boiling bones for
grease. The faunal assemblages would seem to
support this presumption, as most are severely
splintered, crushed, and broken. The fact that
crushed bone appears in much of Toyah pottery
may not be a coincidence (Hester 1995).
There is debate as to whether the Toyah phase
seen in the South-Central Texas archaeological
record is a result of a group of people moving
into the region, or of adapted technologies
from the region’s periphery. Johnson (1994a)
has provided a synthesis of Toyah-phase
archaeological sites in the region and has argued
that the Toyah remains represent groups of
people attracted to and following herds of bison.
Indeed, there is evidence of bison returning in
large numbers to South-Central Texas around
the beginning of the Toyah phase (Dillehay
1974). Furthermore, the argument that Toyah
populations adapted to bison hunting is rather
convincing in terms of the artifacts. Although
its style is unique, and some would argue that
style is the indicator of change (e.g. Sackett
1989; Weissner 1983), Johnson (1994a) offers
that the Perdiz point was functionally designed
to hunt bison. He believes the piercing point
would have been ideal if shot in adequate
numbers to make the bison slowly bleed to
death. The Perdiz is widely found throughout
Texas, and often associated with bison kills (e.g.
Ricklis and Collins 1994). Bone implements
and stone perforators were presumably used
for penetrating hides, while the commonly
occurring stone endscrapers were thought to be
used to prepare the hides (Creel 1991). If, as
Johnson argues, bison were sought as a highly
ranked resource in the diet, they must have
attracted an influx of people from all around the
periphery of South-Central Texas.
Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the
occurrence of a distinct change in diet between
the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric
components in two sites in the Choke Canyon
Reservoir area in South Texas. Analysis of
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

the number of identified specimens (NISP)
shows a marked increase in artiodactyla
elements present during the later part of the
Late Prehistoric, an increase largely due to
the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele
and Assad-Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991)
suggests that the sudden return of bison to
South and Central Texas resulted from a more
xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and
increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers and Post
Oak Savannah in North-Central Texas, forming
a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain
along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau
(Huebner 1991:354–355). Sites from this
period frequently have associated bison (Black
1986; Black and McGraw 1985; Henderson
1978; Hulbert 1985; Prewitt 1974).
The only archaeological evidence that
domesticated plants were ever introduced into
South or Central Texas is a single corncob
found in Late Prehistoric context in Timmeron
Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985), one
found during excavations in Kyle Shelter in Hill
County (Jelks 1962:113–114), and Zea mays
remains at the Wild Turkey Midden (41MI8)
in Mills County (Holloway 1988:4, 8). There
simply is not enough evidence to postulate
there was ever a significant presence of maize
in the area. The arrival of the Spanish during
the later Protohistoric/Historic period brought
significant cultivars to Central Texas.
Attempts at estimating prehistoric populations
in the region are questionable; however, Johnson
(1994a) has reviewed the site sizes, campfires,
and/or structures associated with Toyah sites,
and argues that they were normally organized
in bands of perhaps three or four matrilocal
families. He surmises that because these groups
were seasonally following the bison in fall and
winter, and then pursuing other abundant plant
and animal resources available seasonally,
there was no need to increase their population;
because they were wandering and coming
into constant contact with both adequate food
resources and neighboring bands, there was no
need to organize patrilocally in order to claim
territories, and brides were always available.

In Jelks’ opinion,
“the Toyah focus probably came to an end during
the Late Prehistoric period, at which time it was
replaced over much or all of Central Texas by
a short-lived complex of artifacts that included
triangular arrow points, Goliad Plain pottery
(described by Monger 1959:164–165), and
probably other distinctive artifact styles. This
hypothetical complex—if it actually exists—
may represent the archaeological remains of
the historic and protohistoric Tonkawa and/or
Jumano Indians” (Jelks 1962:99).

3.2.8 Protohistoric/Historic
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning
of the Historic period in both Central and South
Texas is characterized by written accounts of
European contact with indigenous groups. The
period between de Vaca’s written account and
the advent of Spanish missions around San
Antonio and East Texas in the late 1600s and
early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric;
a time when few, scant written documents
exist detailing Native American life outside
the missions, and those that do exist are
written from a Eurocentric point of view. The
Historic period then, is generally thought of as
beginning in the 1700s. Collins (1995:386–387)
offers that the Historic period begins ca. 260
BP in Central Texas. However, in South Texas
Hester (1995:450–451) agrees with Adkins
and Adkins (1982:242) when he suggests that
the indigenous groups may have been affected
by European influence, but we are only able
to observe the materials in the archaeological
record because the written accounts simply are
not available. He would rather label this largely
unknown period Protohistoric.
The cultural context for the historic groups
in the area of study is largely conditioned
by the presence of outside ethnic groups and
regional power struggles. Linguistically,
early Protohistoric accounts of the late
1500s indicate that a large group who spoke
Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as
South-Central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
31

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and
the name refers to the many small bands of
Native Americans who lived in northeastern
Coahuila, Mexico, and South Texas. However,
today’s language researchers (e.g., Campbell
and Campbell 1981) now believe that the
term is too generic, and that in fact there may
have been hundreds of different languages
and dialects spoken by the many small groups
in the region. The numerous small groups
of Coahuiltecans encountered by the early
explorers and later Spanish intrusions are
addressed in many sources (Campbell 1983;
Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989a,
1989b; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton
1952). The various later intrusive groups, such
as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche,
are also described by numerous researchers
(Ewers 1969; Hester 1989a, 1989b; Johnson
and Campbell 1992; Jones 1969; Kelley
1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a,
1953b). By most accounts, the Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the
Protohistoric period.
The Protohistoric period begins in 1528, when
Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed
parts of Southeast and South Texas and left a
diary of his five years spent traveling among
the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern
Mexico (Covey 1961). Cabeza de Vaca’s
account of his stay with the Miriami in 1533–
34 indicates that groups of Native Americans
would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall,
winter, and summer, occasionally sending a
hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer.
In the summer, many groups would live near
each other in the semiarid environs of South
Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–
37). In 1542, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado
entered the Texas Panhandle with hopes of
finding riches (Flint et al. 2004; Winship 1896);
the same year, after assuming command from
Hernando de Soto, Spanish explorer Luis de
Moscoso Alvarado ventured into Northeast
Texas and encountered Caddoan-speaking
groups before turning back (Weddle 2008).
32

In 1568, Englishman David Graham returned
from Mexico to Nova Scotia, passing inland
along the Texas Gulf Coast (Cutrer 1985:7–12).
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had
established large ranches in northern Mexico,
with several hundred thousand cattle, using
indigenous slaves as labor. Large mining
ventures in northern Mexico did the same. This
encroachment from the south forced Native
Americans to escape into the South-Central
Texas region. The Spanish pushed into New
Mexico in 1598 and made Santa Fe the capital
in 1608 (Chipman 1992).
Their harsh treatment of the natives led to the
Pueblo Rebellion of 1680. The Spanish and
a few loyal native groups fled to the El Paso
area and established Isleta Pueblo, but left
behind thousands of horses, which provided
mobility that would significantly disrupt
groups in South-Central Texas forever. By
the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure
on the Indians indigenous to the area began
to come from the north: a nomadic group, the
Apache, who had adapted to a Plains-lifeway
of nomadic bison hunting, especially once they
acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). A few daring Apache
had escaped slavery in New Mexico before
the rebellion, and they now owned a means of
transportation that would allow them to hunt
and raid with a vengeance. By the mid-1700s
they had encroached through the plains of the
Texas Panhandle and were taking over hunting
grounds in Central Texas. Later, the Apaches
were displaced by the Comanches from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Few landowners dared to live on their outlying
lands until about 1749, when a treaty with the
Apaches brought peace for a while (de la Teja
1995:100). By the late 1700s, the Comanche
had acquired horses and swept out of the
Rockies southward, for a time allying with the
Wichita of western Oklahoma, and forcing the
Apache to seek an alliance with their enemy,
the Spanish. The alliance culminated in an
attack and destruction of Mission San Sabá
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

near Menard, Texas, in 1758. The establishment
of the mission, at the request of the Apaches,
infuriated the Comanches and Wichita allies.
They attacked with not only bows and arrows,
but also with French-made muskets (Hindes et
al. 1995; Weddle 1964). By that time the French
and English were encroaching from the east,
and establishing trade relations with the natives
up and down the Red River (Morris 1970:80–
81). Meanwhile, the Spanish missions in San
Antonio were well established and were taking
in refugee bands pushed out by the Spanish and
Apaches (Chipman 1992). Apaches continued
to range over the area between San Antonio and
Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into
the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). Weary of warfare with
the Comanche, a few Apaches were beginning
to seek asylum in the missions (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
In the autumn of 1785, a peace treaty established
in Santa Fe between the Don Juan Bautista
de Anza, representing the Spanish Crown,
and Cuera (Leather Jacket), representing the
Comanches. The treaty signaled the opening
of a period of peaceful coexistence in what
is today Bexar County, in which Comanches
brought hides, meat, and tallow to San Antonio
to trade for goods and services not available
elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun
repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221–224; Poyo and
Hinojosa 1991:125–126). The few Comanches
who entered the missions were apparently
women and children who were captured during
punitive raids by Spanish soldiers (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:26).
A combination of migration, demoralization,
intergroup conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups,
and forced continual mixing and remixing
among them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975,
1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native
languages have been lost, although recent
attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g.
Johnson 1994b; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
The establishment and relocation of Spanish
Ecological Communications Corporation

Catholic missions along the San Antonio River
in the late 1600s and early 1700s induced
many groups to seek the relative comfort and
protection offered by a sedentary, apparently
well-fed, and peaceful coexistence (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja
1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995;
Inglis 1964). Although fear of the invading
Apache and Comanche pressured many of the
Indians to seek the protection of missions, they
were now exposed to the exploitation of the
Spanish (Campbell 1975:2, 1991:346–347).
The Historic period is best documented by
the records of Spanish priests in charge of the
missions. Campbell and Campbell (1981) list
dozens of named groups who entered the San
Antonio missions at one time or another. The
documents also speak of European-induced
disease that decimated entire groups both
within and outside the missions. In this time of
turmoil, groups were forced to meld together
to survive. Indian depredations impeded
westward settlement until around 1836, when
Texas gained its independence from Mexico
and Texas Rangers offered better protection
(Leffler 2001). Although peace was declared
under a treaty with the Comanche in 1845,
continued Indian depredations occurred to Euro
American settlers pushing westward, taking
farm and ranchlands that were once hunting
grounds (e.g., Wilbarger 1985).

3.2.9 Zilker Park History
The land that is now considered Zilker Park
has likely had a long history of use by Indians
and explorers due to Barton Springs. The first
recorded occupation of the area was by the
Spanish, who in 1730 established a mission
within the current park boundaries near the
Colorado River. This mission was part of
early attempts by Isidro Félix de Espinosa of
Querétaro to establish missions within Spanish
Texas; however, the mission was relocated to
the San Antonio River in 1731 (Habig 2009).
The area around Barton Springs was included
in a league of land that was granted to Henry
33

Chapter 3

Paleoenvironment and Cultural Context

P. Hill in 1835, a colonist of Empresario
Benjamin R. Milam. In the late 1830s, William
Barton settled near the springs and may have
operated a sawmill at the location in 1839
(Austin-American Statesman 1953; National
Register of Historic Places [NRHP] 1997). It
was at this time (1839) that Travis County and
the nearby City of Austin were founded (NRHP
1997). William Barton died in 1840, and the
springs now bear his name (NRHP 1997).
After Barton’s death, the property around the
springs had no permanent settlers until Ashford
B. McGill began purchasing property in the
area in 1855 (Hendrix n.d.). McGill served
as Travis County clerk between 1846 and
1857, and eventually built a ranch house on
the property (NRHP 1997). McGill sold the
property to Phineas de Cordova in 1860, who
later sold the property to William C. Walsh in
1867 (Hendrix n.d.). The heirs of William C.
Walsh eventually sold the land to Andrew J.
Zilker in 1901 (Hendrix n.d.). During the time
between McGill and Zilker’s ownership of
the property, several people sought to use the
water power of Barton Creek for mills. G. T.
Rabb, who owned the land on the south side of
the creek, leased the power rights to Michael
Paggi to operate an ice factory and grist mill
on the creek sometime in the 1870s (NRHP
1997). Rabb eventually sold this mill to Jacob
Stern, and it was operated under the name of
Barton Springs Feed Mill (NRHP 1997). In
1879, Messrs. English, Darr, and English built
a flour mill at the creek (Daily Democratic
Statesman 1879). The springs at Barton Creek
also attracted visitors from Austin as early as

34

the 1840s due to its appeal as a recreation spot
(NRHP 1997). The Daily Austin Republican
(1868) praised the springs as a “charming
bathing place,” encouraging locals to utilize
the springs.
Andrew J. Zilker emerged as a prominent
business man in Austin in the 1890s, having
made a fortune in the ice-making industry
(Hendrix n.d.; NRHP 1997). After purchasing
the property around the springs from the Walsh
family in 1901, Zilker began acquiring adjacent
land and by 1913, he owned several hundred
acres that include what is now Zilker Park
(NRHP 1997). Zilker farmed this property on
a limited basis, and also leased the land for
industrial and recreational purposes (NRHP
1997). In 1918, Zilker deeded the 35 acres
surrounding Barton Springs to the City of Austin
(City of Austin 2009b). A subsequent donation
of 300 acres was made in 1932 and collectively
these tracts became Zilker Park (City of Austin
2009b). There was little development in the
park prior to the 1930s; however, in the 1920s,
a bath house and city pool were constructed
on the north side creek and sports fields were
laid out on the south side of the creek (Austin
American Statesman 1929; NRHP 1997).
The largest development in the park occurred
during the Great Depression, when workers
from the Texas Civil Works Administration and
later the Civilian Conservation Corps worked
on the park between 1934 and 1939 (Austin
American Statesman 1934; NRHP 1997). By
1939, the park had been fully developed, and
has operated as a City of Austin Park ever since.

Addressed at the
Vara Daniel Site
During this Project
This section considers the regional historic
context that serves as a basis for formulating
research issues pertinent to the prehistoric
period. Identifying and addressing these
research themes before and during the Vara
Daniel archaeological project provided a
framework within which the significance
of the cultural resources and data from the
project could be evaluated. Data recovery
projects such as this one may produce site data
that address geomorphic processes and site
integrity issues. In this regard, we considered
several themes that could be addressed through
excavating 1 x 1-m squares and collecting and
testing soil samples.

4.2.1 Site Integrity
An important research issue that must be
investigated on any archaeological project is
understanding the geological context (Butzer
1982; Waters 1992). This usually involves
examining published geological and soil
maps for the area under study, describing the
sediments and soils actually observed, and
placing the archaeological materials within this
depositional context. One ultimate objective
of this effort is to determine the potential
for recovering archaeological information
from well-preserved, buried contexts. Most
sites have only a low potential for preserving
occupations in a buried geological context
because they exist on the surface or in eroded

contexts; it is critical to identify those few
sites that are well preserved in order to
efficiently target archaeological investigations.
A validation of high site integrity at the Vara
Daniel Site occurs when the geoarchaeological
investigations complement the archaeological
results, indicating that there are one or more
gisements (Collins 1995:374), or well-defined
cultural strata enveloped by gently laid-down
alluvium sediments from Barton Springs and
Colorado River flooding events.

4.2.2 Depositional and
Stratigraphic Sequences
Issue
Geoarchaeological studies were considered
critical to an overall assessment of site integrity,
and focused on two themes: 1) the mesoscale
site setting, and 2) the microscale or occupationspecific details. The macroscale setting of
the site was relatively clear from previous
investigations (e.g., Nash et al. 2008; Ricklis
et al. 1991). The proposed target occupation
resides in a deposit Blum (1992) and Blum
and Valastro (1994) later named the Columbus
Bend Alloformation Member 1, which dates to
the late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene. In their
Phase I work in the immediate area around the
project area, Nash et al. (2008) provided good
documentation of cored deposits, but focused
on archaeological data recovery during Phase
II, and thus did not provide any lithological
analyses or description in conjunction with
cultural material deposits. Given the site’s
location at the confluence of two streams and
near a major spring, the depositional setting has
the potential to be complex.

Research Questions and Testing Strategy

Strategy
The mesoscale analytical theme of this current
project was designed to document the alluvial
depositional landscape in direct proximity to
the block excavation in order to describe how
it formed through time. This work largely
focused on the sedimentary matrix rather
than its biological constituents, although the
stable isotopic composition of the bulk organic
carbon (which is a proxy record for past
vegetation) was also documented. In order to
provide a solid setting for the site excavation,
the geoarchaeological studies proposed to
document the deposits near the block by coring,
and then provide a detailed characterization of
two columns: one located at the excavation
block itself, and a second from one or two of
the cores near the block. Each of these profiles
would be radiocarbon dated to provide a clear
understanding of the chronological structure
of the deposits. It was estimated that four
radiocarbon dates per column should provide
sufficient control. The profile characterization
was to consist of analyses to determine the
sediment texture, organic carbon content,
stable isotopic composition of organic matter
(δ13C), and the calcium carbonate content for
each sample analyzed; these data would permit
us to tie into the previous investigations at the
site, as well as the existing literature for the
Colorado River alluvial stratigraphy.
The microscale theme aimed to describe and
characterize the microscale environmental
setting of the target occupation by documenting
multiple profiles within the block excavation
itself, paying particular attention to how the
sedimentary matrix varies within the block; the
deposits associated with specific site features;
and potential disturbance of the deposits.
The methods proposed here included simple
description (physical description and photo
documentation), and sample characterization
(microstructure through soil micromorphology,
texture, δ13C, organic carbon, and calcium
carbonate). The geoarchaeologist also proposed
to collect bulk and micromorphology samples
of occupation surface and bounding strata, and
analyze samples of deposits associated with the
36

target occupation (organic C, δ13C, texture).
Thin sections for micromorphological studies
would be made, analyzed, and reported.
In addition, multiple lines of evidence would
be sought that would validate the age of
layered sediments either in an absolute or
relative manner. When present, charcoal would
be collected and submitted for AMS dating.
Complementing any obtainable charcoal
(14C) dates, a vertical sequence of soil matrix
would be analyzed for either microcarbon or
soil organic carbon (humics and humates). In
addition, a vertical sequence of OSL samples
would be submitted for corroboration. Finally,
if warranted, faunal remains, mussel shell
fragments, and snail shell fragments would be
considered for possible dating.

4.2.3 Effects upon Cultural
Deposits; Isoluble or Mixed
Issue
It has been pointed out that sediments and soils
are not static mediums (Wood and Johnson
1978). Natural post-depositional processes
affecting the vertical distribution of artifacts
include frost heave, dry soil creep, solifluction
(saturated soil creep), and subsidence (sinking)
in cave deposits. Although in some cases these
processes are easily identifiable in the field, in
many other cases they are not. Another postdepositional disturbance often overlooked
is biogenic perturbation, e.g., termites,
earthworms, and other animal burrowing.
Human post-depositional influences on artifacts
may include trampling, tool reuse, posthole
digging, storage pits, baking pits, or burial
graves, and borrowing sediments for sealing
cooking ovens or ceramic manufacture.
Villa (1982:277) points out that both Old
World and New World archaeologists
routinely observe clear breaks in sedimentary
stratigraphy
with
associated
cultural
material, and accept these separations as
isoluable components. As such, these discrete

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

assemblages are suitable for constructing
relative cultural chronologies. However, she
argues that stratigraphic disturbances and
the resulting movement of artifacts are not
always obvious and detectable by even the
most trained eye in the field. She cites “living
floor” studies that presume that layers that
appear to be undisturbed “would yield discrete
assemblages,” but were sometimes criticized
as too coarse grained (Villa 1982:277).
Even thin floors may represent a palimpsest
of occupations, and “considerable vertical
displacement of artifacts (both upward and
downward) may occur even when the matrix
itself has not been disturbed or displaced”
(Villa 1982:278).
Yellen (1977:103), Gifford and Behrensmeyer
(1977), and Stockton (1973) argue that
trampling will cause the smaller artifacts to
move downward, while generally leaving the
larger artifacts on or very near their original
surface. Periodic wetting and drying of soils
due to percolating rainwater and an oscillating
water table will also cause artifacts to move
downward (Cahen and Moeyersons 1977). In
sum, Villa (1982:286–287) cautions against
“overinterpreting stratified sequences” without
analyzing conjoinable pieces of stone, bone,
and pottery relative to the total assemblage.
Gifford-Gonzalez and others (1985:808) have
demonstrated in experimental studies that 94
percent of artifacts recovered in loamy soils
were vertically within 1 cm of their original
placement after trampling, and the looser
matrix caused by trampling “caught and held
small- to medium-sized flakes.” Conversely,
in sandy soils the majority of artifacts easily
worked their way downward, at least until they
encountered a moist layer of sand. GiffordGonzalez and others (1985) further concluded
from their experiments and those of Villa
and Courtin (1983) that length, weight, and
volume are interrelated variables that affect
the downward displacement of flakes caused
by trampling, and thus statistically can be used
interchangeably to evaluate their stratigraphic
integrity.
Ecological Communications Corporation

Unlike trampling, which causes artifacts
to move downward, argilliturbation causes
artifacts to move upward. Wetting and drying
of surficial layers of clays, called vertisols (Soil
Survey Staff 1993), push artifacts toward the
surface. “When expansion occurs, an artifact is
lifted slightly from its original position, leaving
a small void or cavity under the artifact. As
the soil dries, the matrix around the artifact
shrinks. Because the cavity under the artifact
also shrinks, the artifact cannot fall back into its
original position, and fine-grained particles fill
the void” (Waters 1992:299–300).

Strategy
Flake Length and Weight Comparability
The above studies, as well as others, implicate
that the integrity of occupation zones can be
methodically tested by examining the vertical
distribution of artifacts; on occupation surfaces
that have been heavily trampled, particularly in
sandy soils, we should see an inverted pyramid
-shaped vertical distribution, with greater
quantities of larger flakes on or near the surface,
underlain by progressively smaller flake
quantities and sizes. Conversely, on occupation
surfaces that are covered by vertisols we should
see size sorting in the form of smaller artifacts
moving upward. There will be exceptions:
animal burrowing, subsequent cracking in
clayey soils, and some human intervention (e.g.,
borrowing and digging) may displace larger
artifacts to lower levels and conversely, smaller
artifacts upward; however, an overall mean size
(or weight) displayed vertically by excavated
level should exhibit the inverted pyramid shape.
Although we agree with Villa (1982) that the
best method to evaluate the vertical movement
of artifacts is by refitting or conjoining artifacts,
using flake weights and lengths have also been
demonstrated as effective alternative means of
evaluating vertical displacement.
Assuming

produced. At other sites in South and
Central Texas, archaeologists (Nickels 2000;
Nickels et al. 1998:91–92; Vierra 1998)
have examined the vertical movement of
artifacts through soil horizons, and they
have successfully correlated the data with
occupation levels. Thus, comparing the
mean flake length of complete flakes, and
the mean weight of incomplete flakes with
the soil zones and horizons identified in
the geomorphological study to evaluate the
stratigraphic differences in size sorting is
a viable means to evaluate site integrity. In
addition to the possibility that larger flakes
move downward on stable landscapes, we
also assume that smaller flakes will move
downslope easier as sheetwash, and will be
buried before larger flakes.

sheetwash effect, followed by larger gravels
and cobbles. Thus, initially one would expect
to see a bottom-up vertical trend with, larger
clasts following a smaller clast trend. The
same is true for lithic debitage. The sheetwash
effect should move smaller flakes downslope,
followed by larger ones. On the other hand, in
a stable landscape with loose sands, one would
expect to see larger flakes moving downward
in greater abundance than medium and small
flakes. Fewer rocks of greater size suggests
that erosion was more rapid during the
periods when these levels of sediments were
deposited, resulting not only in a less stable
living surface, but also in more rapid burial of
archaeological remains. Periods of decline in
colluviation and/or alluviation allow cultural
material to accumulate on relatively more
stable land surfaces.

Artifact and Natural Material
Clast Comparisons

Lithic Damage

If artifacts are moving downward (or even
upward), then natural clasts (gravels) of
equal sizes and volumes should be moving in
conjunction. One method of examining these
data is to compare the vertical distribution of
sizes, weights, or volumes of both cultural
and non-cultural lithic material. When the
mean sizes (or weights) of non-cultural rocks
and cultural flakes trend together, it suggests
that heavier clasts are moving downward.
Furthermore, Ricklis (2001:134) argues that
if the artifact and gravel trends track together,
then that suggests colluvium deposited both
the artifacts and the gravels together; if the two
don’t track, then spikes in gravels represent “…
episodes of colluvial deposition.”

Magnetic Soil Susceptibility Values

Non-Cultural Clast Size Sorting
It is our contention that in an alluvial
environment, gravels are size sorted as the
current lessens, and heavier clasts are dropped
from the bedload, followed by successively
lighter clasts. However, in a colluvial
environment, the smaller gravels are loosened
by erosion and deposited downslope in a
38

If, as suggested above, stone tools and debitage
have been secondarily distributed either by
colluvial or alluvial processes along with
gravels, the cultural material should exhibit
at least some degree of edge or ridge damage
from bumping and grinding against the gravels.

Sediment and cultural zones within soil
profiles would be analyzed for their relative
magnetic soil susceptibility. Soils acquire
a magnetic susceptibility from the Earth’s
ambient magnetic field. The proportion of this
constant magnetic force is called the magnetic
susceptibility. This low-field susceptibility
is also proportional to the concentration of
ferro- and ferromagnetic constituents of the
material. The magnetic susceptibility of soils
can be altered by both pedogenic and cultural
processes. In both cases, the organically
induced pedogenic and cultural processes
enhance (increase) the susceptibility values. In
pedogenic studies, a significant increase in soil
susceptibility values has been observed in the
A horizon of soil profiles, probably as a result
of organic activities, which creates maghemite

(see for example, Singer and Fine 1989). Other
research (e.g., Heller and Evans 1995) indicate
that the susceptibility values can also be altered
by changes in climate.

to prolonged flooding … the phosphate moves
from the solid soil material into the water and
can be transported from its original location”
(Lewis 1978:311; Patrick and Khalid 1974).

Although pedogenic and climatic processes
that may alter the magnetic susceptibility of
soils are important, and begs further research
on and around archaeological sites, thus far the
most significant variability in susceptibility
noted by archaeologists and Wulf Gose,
Director of the Paleomagnetism Laboratory
at The University of Texas at Austin, has
been derived from the presence of wood ash
and charcoal. Granted, wood ash can also
be present due to past range and forest fires.
However, horizontal studies within distinct
strata indicate that the increase in values
around prehistoric hearths is remarkably
distinct, as is the vertical separation of
clearly distinguishable cultural strata from
natural strata (see for example, Gose and
Nickels 1998). This is particularly true if
multiple heating events are distinguishable
in the archaeological record (e.g., Heller and
Evans 1995). In Central Texas, where many
of the soils are particularly carbonaceous, the
increase in magnetic susceptibility values on
archaeological sites is remarkably significant
compared to the culturally unaltered
surrounding soils (Collins et al. 1990).

A numerical measurement to record the
amount of acidity or alkalinity (in terms of
phosphate content) in soils is the pH (potential
of Hydrogen), a function of the positively
charged hydrogen atom in soils. Based on
their pH content, soils can be categorized as
either acidic, neutral, or alkaline (Soiltest, Inc.
1976:129).

Soil pH Values
Although according to Lewis (1978:309),
“soil chemists and geochemists have known
for many years that phosphorous in the most
common form as phosphate does not leach
out or move about in the soil,” the process of
evaluating the degree of phosphates in soils
is not without its problems. For example,
Crowther (2003a) submits that soils of
different textures have varying degrees in their
capability to retain phosphate. In addition,
caution is advised when evaluating the contexts
of samples because phosphate content may
have been introduced with modern fertilizers
and large herds of grazing animals (Crowther
2003a). Also, “in swamps and areas subjected
Ecological Communications Corporation

Alkaline or calcareous soils are characterized
by high pH values, and contain higher degrees
of alkaline materials such as calcium and
magnesium; calcium and magnesium also
are substantial elements of bone. Highly
calcareous and alkaline soils are generally
found in limestone-dominant terrain such as
the Edwards Plateau in Central Texas. Acidic
soils, which have low pH values, are those
in which the alkaline materials have been
removed due to water flow-through (Lewis
1978:311; Patrick and Khalid 1974), or because
the natural phosphates have been absorbed by
agricultural crops (Soiltest, Inc. 1976:129).
Although pH values can range from 0 to 14,
soils that are extremely alkaline can have a high
value of 11; a neutral soil pH value is 7; and
soils that are extremely acidic can have a low
value of 2 (Birkeland 1974:21).
The amount of pH (phosphate) present in soils
is increased in areas where human occupations
have resulted in the accumulation of organic
wastes (Lewis 1978:310). Thus, as a vertical
soil profile is evaluated, one would expect
higher pH values to correlate with stratigraphic
levels of increased human occupation. When
evaluating pH values horizontally within the
same stratigraphic level of an archaeological
site, one would expect to see higher pH levels
in areas of the site that were more intensively
occupied or that served as midden areas.

4.2.4 Changes in Paleoindian to
Early Archaic Subsistence
and Mobility Patterns
Issues
Early Paleoindian to Late Paleoindian
The earliest clear and well-defined
manifestation of the Paleoindian period is the
Clovis culture (11,200–10,900 BP). Clovis
lithic artifacts comprise a diverse assemblage
derived from biface, flake, and prismatic blade
technology (Collins 2004). Projectile points
were typically well-made lanceolate forms,
both fluted and unfluted, on high-quality
chert. Other types of lithic artifacts that have
been found on Clovis horizon sites include
stones engraved with geometric or random
lines (Black 2001; Collins 2004; Karbula et
al. 2007), stone bolas, and ochre. One wellknown site, the Kinkaid Rock Shelter, featured
a stone-paved floor with butchered Clovisperiod faunal remains overlying it, attesting to
an advance degree of social organization for
this time.
Archaeologists originally described peoples
of the Early Paleoindian period as nomadic
hunters and gatherers who subsisted mainly on
hunting big game and now-extinct megafauna
(Suhm et al. 1954; Willey 1966:37). One
reason for this is that many of the earliest
Paleoindian sites investigated were jump sites
and bison kill sites, where the focus of activity
was clearly on hunting big game. However,
more recent investigations of campsites and
other site types in Central and other parts of
Texas have proven this model to be misleading
(Collins 2004). Faunal research at sites with
Paleoindian components in Central Texas, such
as Pavo Real in San Antonio, Wilson-Leonard
in Williamson County, and the Gault Site in
Bell County, have shown that Paleoindian
peoples practiced a more generalized
subsistence strategy than previously believed,
and exploited large, medium, and small game
alike, as well as marine and plant resources.
Most Paleoindian sites known within Central
40

Texas are in fact situated at the ecotone between
the Balcones Escarpment and the Blackland
Prairie where a wide variety of resources
were available, suggesting that camps were
intentionally located to exploit the diverse
resources that characterize this area. Lithic
artifacts and feature remains also support the
idea that Paleoindian lifeways did not differ too
greatly from the diverse subsistence practices
that came later, with peoples making seasonal
migrations through a defined territory, stopping
at temporary encampments.
The Clovis horizon contrasts somewhat with
the later Folsom interval, for which mainly kill
sites have been documented. Sites with Folsom
components such as Wilson Leonard, Horn
Shelter, and Pavo Real attest to more hunting
specialization, and have yielded a stone tool kit
of points, end-scrapers, and ultra-thin bifaces
more geared toward hunting than generalized
subsistence. Other late Paleoindian cultural
expressions include corner/side-notched points
such as Wilson and San Patrice, which appear
to bear more resemblance to Archaic-period
projectile tool styles. Small features or clusters
of burned rock begin to appear in archaeological
components of the Late Paleoindian period,
though the large well-made hearths that define
the Archaic are typically absent (Black 1989a;
Collins 1998).

Late Paleoindian to Early Archaic
Collins currently dates the Paleoindian period
in Central Texas to about 11,500–8800 BP.
However, he freely admits that the latter part
of this period and the early part of the Early
Archaic are the least understood and therefore
the most difficult to define culturally and
chronologically (personal communication,
January 23, 2009). It is clear that the Angostura
and similar lanceolate-shaped forms that were
generally thought to be Late Paleoindian in
age continue into what we know today as the
Early Archaic. In addition, the transition from
lanceolate-style points to early corner-notched
points does not seem to hold consistent with
the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

lifeways. For example, unfluted lanceolate
points at Wilson-Leonard were dated to
9500–8000 BP, while the Wilson component
with corner-notched, Archaic-like Wilson dart
points was dated to about 10,000–9650 BP.
Despite the obvious difference in time, which
places the Wilson component as the older
occupation, the Wilson component exhibits
an impression much more Archaic than
Paleoindian in nature, with fire-cracked rock
features, a burial, and a wider variety of stone
tools and faunal remains (Collins 2004).
In sum, more is known about the lifeways of
Early Paleoindian, Folsom, and Clovis cultures
than is known about the Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic, with both stemmed lanceolate
and corner-notch forms. More work is needed
before we can begin to understand how the early
corner-notched tradition fits into the cultural
and chronological interpretations of both the
Late Paleoindian and Archaic periods in Texas.

Strategy
Lithic Analysis and Use-Wear Studies
EComm anticipated that lithic materials
would comprise the bulk of all artifacts
recovered from the excavations of the Vara
Daniel Site. Analysis of the lithic materials
was to be tailored toward generating data
about Paleoindian hunter-gatherer lifeways
with respect to technology, food procurement,
mobility patterns, and social organization. The
analysis of lithic materials would consider the
raw material used, artifact form and type, stage
of manufacture, patterns of use, breakage,
resharpening, and discard, and use wear on a
valid sample of tool types. Also, documenting
the raw materials used for tools could help
researchers understand patterns of mobility.
Use-wear studies would attempt to identify
differences between tools that were used to
process plants versus tools that were used to
process animals. These data could possibly
feed into questions about food procurement and
diet, but also patterns of social organization,
Ecological Communications Corporation

and potentially spatial organization, though
this last theme may not be answerable given the
horizontally constrained aspect of the project.

Feature Analysis
In addition to collecting flotation samples from
the soil matrix within and around features,
burned rock features were to be sampled for
archaeomagnetic analysis. Archaeomagnetic
analysis provides a reliable technique to
determine the context of burned rock features
and many of the use parameters, such as
maximum heating temperature, reuse of burned
rock, possible stone boiling, and approximate
heating time. This information could be critical
in the analysis of prehistoric subsistence and
cooking strategies (Wandsnider 1997).
When rocks originally form, they adopt a
magnetic signature pointing toward the current
magnetic north. If collected and heated in a
hearth or earth oven, their magnetic field will
be altered. As they cool, the rocks will adopt a
magnetic signature aligned with the magnetic
north existing at the time. If this burned rock
is moved by natural processes or humans after
it has cooled, then the magnetic alignment
preserved in the rock will shift from the
magnetic pole. In some cases, a rock may be
moved while it is cooling or it may have been
heated more than once, and thus two or more
magnetic alignments can be preserved in the
rock. By using a series of measurements with a
stepped heating process in a laboratory (usually
at 50°C-increments), the magnetic alignment at
different temperatures can be measured. The
reheating erases the magnetic signal preserved
in the rock at the reheating temperature or
below. Thus, heating events can be deciphered
and heating temperatures reconstructed.

Botanical Studies
All samples from features and from contexts
with potential to provide data related to
the research goals for the site were to be
processed for subsequent identification by
a macrobotantical analyst. Bulk sediment
41

Chapter 4

Research Questions and Testing Strategy

that appeared to be sterile, based on visual
observation in the field, was to be processed
using a sampling strategy aimed at establishing
a control group. Charred botanical remains
were to be identified to the most specific taxon
possible to aid in data gathering about group
subsistence and paleoenvironment.

Faunal Analysis
All faunal material was to be collected from
test units and screens. Collected faunal
material was to be analyzed to the element and
the most specific taxon possible based on the
completeness and condition of the specimen.
The faunal analyst would also record relevant
data such as cut marks, gnawing marks,
fracturing patterns, and whether the specimen
was burned. Minimum number of individuals
(MNI) of all species identified was to be
calculated so that data such as total animal
biomass could be estimated.

4.2.5 Paleoenvironmental
Reconstruction
Issue
Multiple data sets have been analyzed in
an attempt to interpret and refine a solid
paleoenvironmental record for Texas. Although
not all inclusive, among those paleoecological
resources reviewed include macro and
microfauna, pollen, ostracods, oyster shell
growth patterns, snail species, mussel species,
oxygen isotope values on freshwater mussel
shells, snail and mussel shell growth, diatoms,
phytoliths, soil organic carbon, plant stable
isotope ratios, charred plant species, beetle
fossils, geoarchaeological studies, and eolian

42

dune sediments. Although these innovative
techniques have vastly improved our
understanding of the paleoenvironment, often
there are significant gaps in time, or the data
offer conflicting interpretive information. In
that regard, paleonvironmental studies should
be included in all research designs involving
excavations in deep, finely stratified, and welldated deposits with the potential to yield such
data, and a greater emphasis must be placed
on not only understanding these innovative
techniques, but also in correctly collecting the
appropriate samples for analysis.
Figures 4-1 and 4-2 represent some of the
latest paleoenvironmental data available
before the 2009 Vara Daniel Site excavations
(see also Chapter 3). In general, the interpreted
data provide trends that for the most part
illustrate a consensus on paloenvironmental
changes. At issue however, is that during
certain periods, the data seem to sometimes
yield conflicting results.

Strategy
Although 100 percent of all organic material
would be collected from the ¼-inch screens,
our predetermined scope of work called for
collection of 1 liter (L) of sediment from
every excavation level. This would allow
from more than an ample number of samples
to selectively fine screen and examine for the
presence of microsnails and other microfauna.
Also, some selected samples could be
floted to extract any charred plant remains,
possibly microfauna, and charcoal. These
same sediment samples could be used for
extraction of smaller samples for submission
to consultants specializing in analysis of
ostracodes, diatoms, phytolyths, pollen, etc.

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Methods

Mason D. Miller, Samantha W. Champion, and Daniel J. Rose

5.1	Prefield Preparations
From the outset, the logistical complexity of
the data recovery project was evident. The
targeted Paleoindian occupation zone was
deeply buried under 3 m of overburden. While
the upper 3 m were known to contain younger
cultural deposits that were to be sacrificed
to gain access to the target zone, the THC
nonetheless desired to minimize unnecessary
disturbance to the upper 3 m by restricting the
footprint of the excavation as much as was
possible. Thus, the standard approach to deep
excavations, involving stepping of successively
deeper trenches, was not possible. Moreover,
the site was not only within an environmentally
sensitive area, it was also located within a
heavily used public park. Accordingly, during
the excavation phase EComm assembled a team
of specialized subcontractors including Hicks &
Company (OSHA compliance, website design,
archaeological assistance), Charles Frederick
(geoarchaeology), Raymond Chan and
Associates (site engineering), National Trench
and Safety (NTS; trench safety plan and shoring
systems), J. Harper Construction (mechanical
excavation and installation/removal of trench
shields), National Fence (security fencing),
and Sentry Security & Investigations (security
guard). Subcontracts were negotiated with each
of these providers according to City of Austin
requirements. Key prefield tasks included
development of a site plan and application for
a City of Austin site exemption, development
of an OSHA-compliant trench plan, application
for a Texas Antiquities Permit, and development
of a Quality Control (QC) plan.

Ecological Communications Corporation

5.1.1 Site Plan and City
Exemption
Because the project area was located within
the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone and was
adjacent to Barton Springs, an application
was prepared to the City of Austin Watershed
Protection
and
Development
Review
Department for exemption from project
requirements that normally would have
included preparation of an Environmental
Information Document. The exemption request
was prepared by John King, Professional
Engineer of Raymond Chan and Associates in
accordance with Chapter 25-2-2 of the Austin
City Code. The Site Plan and Exemption
Request is included as Appendix A.
The plan specified, among other limitations,
that the excavation project was not within
100-year floodplain and would not involve
removal of trees, installation of impervious
cover, or changes to local drainage patterns.
Most importantly, to qualify for the exemption,
the site plan stipulated that the total area of
disturbance would be less than 3,000 ft2.
This requirement severely limited size of the
excavation pit, access ramps, screening area,
and overburden piles. The plan specified than
the disturbed area was to be restricted to: the
20 x 20-ft main pit (400 ft2); a 7.73 x 28.45-ft
access ramp (220 ft2); one 30.67 x 13.33-ft main
screening area (378 ft2); three 20 x 20-ft piles
of overburden (1,200 ft2); and one 20 x 20-ft
public screening area (400 ft2). Combined,
these areas totaled approximately 2,600 ft2 of
disturbed area, thus qualifying the project for
the site exemption. The final configuration of
these components can be seen in Figure 5-1.

5.1.2 Health and Safety Plan
Pursuant to City of Austin requirements, a
detailed project Health and Safety Plan was
developed. Among other requirements, the plan
specified daily inspections of the excavations,
the adjacent areas, and the protective systems
by a trained OSHA trench safety-competent
person. The plan also included a detailed trench
safety plan that was prepared according to
OSHA Regulation 29 CFR Part 1926 subpart
P “Construction Standards for Excavations.”
This OSHA-compliant plan was developed
by subcontractor GeoSolutions, Inc., and was
sealed by Carey M. Witt, Professional Engineer.
The Health and Safety Plan is attached as
Appendix B.

5.1.3 Research Design and
Antiquities Permit
Because the excavations were located on
property owned by the City of Austin, a Texas
46

Antiquities Permit was required. The permit
application was submitted on February 17,
2009, and the THC issued Texas Antiquities
Permit 5177 on February 26. The supporting
research design reviewed previous work at the
site and identified the north-central portion of
the rugby field, in the vicinity of PBS&J tests
2, 3, 11, and 12 (Nash et al. 2008), as the area
with the highest research potential with respect
to Paleoindian deposits (see Figure 1-2). The
work plan closely adhered to the proposed
Scope of Work that had been developed by
the City of Austin in 2008, which had been
previously approved by the THC. In summary,
the work plan called for hand excavation of 16
m2 from a depth of approximately 3 m below
the current ground surface to a depth of 5 m, for
a total excavated volume of 32 m3.
The work plan also included details about
the proposed public outreach program
integrating electronic media, print and artifact
displays, and volunteer and staff efforts to
raise awareness of archaeology and educate
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

the public about Austin’s
prehistory. The public outreach
program was coordinated with
the City of Austin’s Parks and
Recreation Department and is
presented in detail in Appendix
C; key components of the
program included:
• an onsite public outreach
booth
with
interpretive
posters,
displays,
and
brochures describing the
site’s background, prehistoric
context, and significance
within the field of archaeology
to be staffed by a professional
archaeologist eight hours per
day, seven days per week;

Figure 5-2. Staking out the project area; facing west.

• tours of the site for school
children and youth groups;
• a dedicated project website including a blog
and live video feed of the ongoing work,
transmitted through an onsite webcam;
• on-site screening by the public of the
mechanically
excavated
overburden,
supervised by a professional archaeologist
and/or volunteers from the Texas
Archaeological Society (TAS); and
• interactive weekend activities such as atlatl
throwing and flint knapping.

5.1.4 Quality Control (QC) Plan
Finally, prefield preparations included
development of a QC plan. The plan identified
and defined policies, procedures, and
organizations that were necessary to comply
with City of Austin contract requirements
and specifications. The QC plan covered all
operations, both on- and off-site, and was
keyed to contract requirements to ensure the
highest possible quality of work. The QC plan
had two equally important primary objectives:
to ensure compliance with EComm’s contract
with the City of Austin; and to ensure scientific
excellence and thereby compliance with

Ecological Communications Corporation

requirements of the Antiquities Permit issued
by the THC.

5.2	Site Preparation
5.2.1 Pinpointing the
Project Area
The project area was laid out on the ruby field
using a submeter-accuracy global positioning
system (GPS), 100-m tape measures, wooden
grid stakes, and pin flags (Figure 5-2). First, the
locations of the four key PBS&J auger tests (2,
3, 11, and 12) were reestablished. Next, within
this zone, the corners of the 20-ft2 footprint
for the main pit were staked, followed by
the corners of the 80 x 120-ft fenced security
perimeter. Finally, locations of the ramp, three
overburden piles, and two screening areas were
staked.

47

Chapter 5

Methods

5.2.2 Security and
Environmental Controls
Security Fencing
Due to the project area’s exposed location near a
busy road within a popular park, establishment
of a security perimeter was necessary both to
protect the site from vandalism and to protect
the public from dangers within the job site.
On March 26, 2009, National Construction
Rentals installed an 8-ft-high chain-link fence
around the excavation area perimeter. In
addition, an internal fence separated the main
excavation area from the northern portion
of the area where the public screening was
planned. The fence was installed in 12-ft
sections, with a total of three access gates.
One pedestrian gate was located by the
planned public outreach station on the south
side of the fenced area; a second pedestrian
gate was located at the public screening area
near the northwest corner of the fenced area;
and the main access gate was located along the
western fenceline (see Figure 5-1).

Security Guard
Because the site was located in a busy public
venue, a security guard was required to prevent
unauthorized access to the site during hours
when the archaeologists were off duty. Sentry
Security & Investigations was contracted to
provide site security and staffed the site with
a uniformed guard seven days per week. The
guard came on duty at 5 pm when the public
outreach specialist went off duty and remained
at the site until the next morning, when the
archaeological crew and/or public outreach
specialist arrived.

Security Badges
All archaeologists and other authorized persons
were issued photographic identification badges
to discourage unauthorized access to the site
during work hours.

48

Silt Fencing
Under the City of Austin-approved site plan
(see Appendix A), a silt fence was required
to trap the excavated sediments and prevent
contamination of Barton Creek. On March 31,
silt fencing was erected downslope of locations
of the planned excavation pits, overburden
piles, and screening areas. In order to install
the silt fencing, crews used a bobcat with a
bucket attachment to dig shallow trenches
approximately 10 cm wide by 20 cm deep around
the perimeter of the project area, including
the four square areas where overburden from
the upper 3 m was stored and screened. Next,
4-ft metal fence posts were installed spaced
approximately 8 ft apart around the perimeter
of the project area, enclosing the project area
and the overburden storage and screening areas.
The silt fencing fabric was then secured to the
fence posts with metal bailing wire.

5.2.3 Mechanical Excavations
The main 20 x 20-ft pit and the access ramp
were mechanically excavated on March 31 by J.
Harper Construction Company using a tracked
front-end loader and a trackhoe with a 4-ft
metal bucket (Figure 5-3). The front-end loader
was used to excavate soils from the main access
ramp while the trackhoe was used to remove
soils from the main pit. As specified in the
Antiquities Permit and the research design, the
upper 3 m of sediments from the pit and ramp
were removed and stored in three separate areas
within the security fence in the northern portion
of the project area. Sediments from the upper 1
m were stored separately from those from 1–2
m deep and also from those from 2–3 m deep.
All mechanical excavation was monitored
by archaeologists, and no features or human
remains were observed during this phase.

5.2.4 Shoring
At the request of both the City of Austin and
the THC, the excavations were conducted
within a severely minimized footprint (20 x 20

ft) relative to the significant
depth (3–5 m) of the target
zone. For aesthetic reasons, the
City wished to keep impacts
within the park to as small of
an area as possible. Similarly,
the THC desired to minimize
the sacrifice of the upper 3 m
that was necessary to reach the
target zone. The archaeological
team, in conjunction with
trench safety contractor (NTS)
and professional engineer
(Carey M. Witt, Professional
Engineer), developed a trench
safety system that complied
with OSHA standards, kept

The steel shields completely protected the
north and south faces of the excavated pit.
To protect excavators from cave-ins along
the unprotected eastern and western faces of
the pit, the shield system was supplemented
with one-inch-thick, overlapping 8 x 12-ft and
5 x 10-ft steel road plates. The plates were
lowered into place by the trackhoe between
the trench wall and the shield’s steel spreaders,
forming horizontal support for the plates in
50

A ramp was constructed at the
west end of the block area to
ensure easy access, fulfilling
OSHA excavation standards
of a means of egress within 25
lateral feet of any worker within
an excavation area (29 CFR
1926.651[c][2]) The deepest
portions of the ramp extended
beyond the 5-ft maximum depth
for trenches not requiring a
shoring system, so a third trench
shield was used in the deepest
portion of the ramp. This shield
measured 16 ft long and 10 ft tall
and was stretched to the ramp’s
7-ft maximum width (Figures 5-6
and 5-7).
The shield system was brought
to the park in its corresponding
parts and assembled on-site by
excavation contractors. Once
fully assembled, the 10-ft and
4-ft shields were lowered into
the main block by a crane, while
the 10-ft ramp shield was pushed
into position with a bulldozer.
The road plates were lowered into
place by the trackhoe bucket, and
all components were tamped into
position with a firm blow from
the trackhoe. When assembly
was complete, the shield system
completely protected excavators
within the pit at the 3-m-deep level
according to OSHA standards.

Aluminum Shoring
Once the main trench shield system was
in place, manual excavation could begin.
However, additional shoring was required
as the pit proceeded from 3 to 5 m deep. To
provide necessary support, the safety system
included a modular aluminum build-a-box
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

composed of 6 x 2-ft aluminum
panels held in place with
aluminum posts at the corners
and the midpoints. The box
formed a solid aluminum wall
around the perimeter of the
block, affording excavators
a sufficient level of cave-in
protection (Figures 5-8 and
5-9). As excavations continued
through deeper levels, the
entire box was incrementally
lowered and additional row
of box plates were added to
the top. Because the system
was modular and split at the
midpoint across the block
wall,
excavations
could
proceed on one side of the
block while the other was
left generally unaltered. This
process was used to excavate
half of the block a meter at a
time, allowing archaeologists
access to a central unit profile.
Additionally, since the box
was divided into relatively
lightweight
aluminum
segments, two people were
able to move and lower them
into position without the need
for heavy equipment.

Several large canopies were
erected over the 20 x 20-ft pit
and access ramp to provide
shade and to prevent rainwater
from flooding the pit and
damaging the integrity of the

necessary to cover both the
pit and entrance ramp: a large
30 x 30-ft canopy covered the main pit, while
two 8 x 10-ft canopies covered the entrance
ramp. Due to high winds in the area, the large
canopy detached several times and had to be
reinstalled and secured. Small shade canopies
were also erected over the screening and field
lab areas, as well as the public viewing area
(Figures 5-13 and 5-14). Finally, a portable

subject to excessive exposure
to the elements. According
to Frederick (2009) these
specific locales represent an
archaeological “sweet spot” that
tends to have the best potential
to illustrate past lifeways.
Once excavation was under
way, the TDS mapped the
laid-out block along with
all accessible unit corners.
Significant finds such as
features or soil stains were also
mapped along their perimeter
and at their apparent tops.

(Figure 5-15). The excavation block itself was
placed near the base of the hill, at the outer
edge of the Creek’s floodplain terrace. This
location can be considered an ideal locale for
in situ site preservation, particularly in regard
to short-lived, well-preserved occupation
surfaces, since these areas are not subject to
overly-frequent flooding episodes that would
result in nominal artifact yields, but are also not
54

With the trench shoring system
as tall as it was above the
surrounding grade, and the very
limited lateral space available
for the TDS within the block
itself, it was very difficult to
conduct speedy and accurate
mapping of the units and
findings within the block. The
difficulty only increased with
each unit level as the target
was lowered farther and farther
below what was visible from
the TDS’s vangate. In some
instances, certain points were
simply impossibly obscured and
could not be collected with the
TDS, even with the temporary
Datum 6 in place.

All TDS points collected were
post-processed using ArcGIS
and established within the
Universal Trans Mercator
(UTM) grid system by georeferencing various
key data points (namely the block corners)
with known UTM coordinates provided by
the site engineer. For elevation calculation
consistency, the archaeological team elected
to maintain the arbitrary elevations collected
in the field, rather than update those to meters
above mean sea level (m amsl).

The TDS proved to be
inefficient
in
providing
readily available, precise
vertical controls for the
excavation block while those
investigations were under
way. To accomplish this, the
excavation team placed a
rotating laser level above a
fixed vertical control datum
(Datum 5: 96.620 m) exactly
3 m below the mapped ground
surface (averaged at 99.620
m) in the northeast corner of
the block. The level’s height
above that vertical datum
was noted and excavators
then used a target mounted
on a telescoping rod to
gather highly-accurate depth
measurements independently
from the TDS (Figures 5-16
and 5-17).

Figure 5-14. Aerial photograph at the beginning of the project;
facing east. Barton springs Road on left. Note the main
canopy is not yet installed. Also note the public screening
area (lower left within security perimeter) is not yet active.

The prime datum used during the excavations
was set even with the modern surface, and
therefore meters or centimeters below datum
(mbd, cmbd) and meters or centimeters
below the surface (mbs, cmbs) are used
interchangeably. Archaeologists relied on
standard measurements off the unit walls for
horizontal control within the excavation block.
Due to a generally low artifact and feature
complement within the excavation area, this
method proved to be the most accurate given

the difficulty of using the TDS within the
block itself.
As excavations progressed through the first
meter of sediment (3.0–4.0 mbs) and test unit
corner nails were driven progressively through
10 levels, they had often migrated slightly in
various horizontal directions across the block.
To re-establish horizontal control within the
block, unit corners were re-mapped from their
original horizontal position using the TDS.

Within the 20 x 20-ft outline of
the machine-dug pit, a 4 x 4-m
excavation block was laid out
using a Sokkia TDS (Figure
5-18). The primary sub-datum
used for excavations was then
established in the northeast
corner of the pit using the TDS,
at a precise depth of 3 m below
datum. After the sub-datum was
established an AGATEC auto
adjusting laser level was set
up over it, which allowed for

vertical measurements with an
accuracy range of ± 1 mm.
According to safety parameters
established by the trench
safety engineer, the block
was to be placed no less than
3 ft from any trench wall.
Archaeologists measured the
block’s eastern wall parallel to
the excavation trench’s eastern
wall and manually laid out the
16 1 x 1-m units off that initial
line using long tapes and
three-inch nails. Excavation
units were designated 1–16,
beginning in the southwest
corner
and
running
in
serpentine fashion to the
northwest corner (see Figure
5-18). Once the block was laid
out, the TDS was employed
to map the unit corners and
provide an absolute elevation
of each unit corner below
the averaged ground surface
elevation within the block.
Nearly all unit corners were
10–20 cm above the prescribed
starting depth of 3 mbs, so
additional manual excavation
was required to remove the
remaining overburden and
get the block to a consistent
elevation.
With each unit level, steel
spikes were driven directly
down until they were flush with
the revised surface elevation.
Over subsequent levels, this
practice resulted in slight drift
of unit corners across the block.
The TDS was employed to
replot the horizontal position of
each of the unit corners within
the block at the 4-m level.

5.3.2 Hand-Excavated Units
As per the research design, all the units within
the block were to be excavated in 10-cm
increments to a depth of 2 m below the primary
sub-datum (3–5 mbs). Because OSHA forbade
the excavations to go below 4 m without the
inner aluminum shoring, a phased excavation
strategy was adopted to allow for as much
exposure of the block’s profile as possible
prior to the insertion of the aluminum shoring
panels. Under this approach, alternating eastern
and western halves of the block were dug in
1-m increments. For example, following the
excavation of the eastern half of the block
(measuring 4 x 2 m in area) down to 4 m, the
eastern profile was drawn and photographed,
and soil susceptibility and pH values were
obtained. This was followed by inserting the
aluminum build-a-box in this half.
Unit excavations within the block were
conducted in 10-cm arbitrary levels using
shovels, picks, and trowels. All depths were
checked with a line and/or laser level. Color
digital photographs were taken of the ending
elevation of all levels in addition to features
encountered. All features were recorded on
a separate form and hand drawn to scale. All
matrix excavated was screened through ¼-inch
hardwire cloth. A 100 percent collection policy
during screening required the collection of all
artifacts, ecofacts, and rocks.

5.3.3 Flooding
Due to heavy, prolonged rains, and despite
the canopies, floodwaters entered the project
area and flooded the pit via the entrance ramp
on April 17, 2009. Water flowing off the two
trench canopies entered the pit along with sheet
wash from outside the fenceline. An estimated
10 m3 of water entered the pit, filling all
excavated units, and on April 18, a gasolinepowered water pump was used to remove the
floodwater. The units were allowed to dry out
for two days, and the crew returned on April
20 for cleanup. The first objective was to
remove a thick layer of sludge that had formed
58

over the excavated units. Despite the flooding,
the compact clay in the unit walls and floors
remained remarkably undisturbed, and the
sludge was scraped clean without disturbing
intact sediments or cultural material.
Flooding had also caused the two large steel
road plates on the eastern side of the pit to shift,
and it was necessary to remove and reposition
those plates. In addition, for added safety, the
engineer directed that additional steel spreaders
and road plates be installed on the western face
of the main pit. The removal and repositioning
of these road plates caused approximately 5 m3
of excess backdirt from the walls to collapse
into the pit. This slumpage was manually
removed on April 22 and 23 and was used to
build up existing berms and create new ones to
prevent recurrence of the flooding episode.

5.3.4 Augering
At the request of the THC, upon completion of
the planned research design of excavating the 32
m3 to 5 mbs, a series of auger tests were dug to
evaluate the potential for intact archaeological
deposits below the 5-mbs elevation. Eight
auger tests were excavated using a two-man
gasoline-powered auger with an 8-inch bit and
an extended flight. The auger tests were dug in
20-cm arbitrary levels to 6.2 mbs (Figures 5-19
and 5-20). All matrix was screened thru ¼-inch
hardwire cloth.

5.3.5 Sampling
Bulk Sediment Samples
A 10-cm3 bulk sediment sample was collected
from the northeast corner of every 10-cm
excavation level; if disturbances were observed
in the northeast corner, then the sample was
collected from elsewhere within the level, and
its location noted on the unit level form. Selected
samples were floted to extract ethnobotanical
remains, microfauna, and microdebitage (see
Flotation discussion below). Small portions
of other selected samples were used for bulk

sediment and OSL dating, as
well as diatom, ostracod, and
soil constituent analysis. The
remaining approximately 761 L
of bulk samples are curated at
TARL for future research.

Soil Monolith Collections
Dual side-by-side soil monolith
columns were collected from
the freshly exposed east wall
profile off the southeast corner
of Unit 5 (Figure 5-21) from
0–5 mbs, and a second set of
dual monoliths were collected
from the freshly exposed west
wall of Unit 11 from 3–5 mbs.
They were collected in 10-cm
levels with 5-cm vertical offsets.
The soil in the upper 3 m was
generally extremely compact,
and a skill saw with a concrete
and mortar cutting blade was
used to cut the samples both
vertically and horizontally.
Then either a trowel or flat iron
bar was used to slice behind
and extract the sample from the
wall. Once extracted, the sample
was wrapped in paper toweling,
followed by clear packaging
tape. The top of the sample
was annotated in permanent
marker with a north arrow and
the sample’s provenience. All
monolith samples are curated at
TARL for future research.

Magnetic
Soil Susceptibility
Magnetic soil susceptibility values were
measured every 2 cm from 0 to 5 mbs down
the freshly exposed east wall profile off the
southeast corner of Unit 5, and on the freshly
exposed west wall of Unit 11 from 3 to 5 mbs.
These are the same profiles from which soil

monoliths were collected, as described above.
Measurements were taken using a hand-held
Gf Instruments Magnetic Susceptibility Meter,
Model SM-20 (Figure 5-22), which records
a sensitivity of 10-6 SI units (10-8m3kg-1). The
values were recorded on standard forms
designed for that purpose, and the data then
entered into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis
and modeling.

Phosphate (pH) Values
The same soil profiles used to
collect monolith and magnetic
soil susceptibility samples were
also used to collect pH data.
Values were recorded using a
hand-held Hanna Instruments

HI 99121 probe. As with soil
susceptibility, readings were
taken every 2 cm down the
profiles, and the data entered
into an Excel spreadsheet for
analysis and modeling.

Flotation Samples

around all five features. In
addition, 105 bulk sediment
samples were later selected
for

potential paleoenvironmental
information. The results from
feature matrices are detailed
with individual features in
Chapter 8.

Microcarbon Samples
Six microcarbon samples of
approximately 1.5 L each were
collected. Four were associated
with features, and two were
associated with an Angosturalike projectile point. All six
samples are curated at TARL.

Archaeomagnetic Samples
Seven archaeomagnetic cores were drilled
from burned rock Features 2 and 3 using an
Echo E-Z Core rock drill, model D-2801,
with a 1-inch diamond-tipped bit (Figure
5-23). The angle and dip were then recorded
using a Brunton compass mounted on a
goniometer. The elevation of each sample
60

relative to the unit datum was also recorded.
A plan view was drawn of the drilled rocks
with the archaeomagnetic sample number
assigned by EComm. After each sample was
scored and marked with a permanent marker to
ensure proper alignment during the laboratory
processing phase, samples were removed and
placed in separate labeled bags. All six samples
were sent to Rob Sternberg at the Department

Snail Samples
For his study of snails, K.
Brown visited the site while the
excavations were ongoing and
collected three 5-gallon buckets
of soil from Units 9 and 16 at
390–400 cmbs that had passed
through the ¼-inch screen,
and he was also provided
with the snails recovered
from
these
proveniences
from the ¼-inch screen.
His preliminary assessment
indicated that snail preservation
was good, and that species
diversity had good potential to
provide
paleoenvironmental
information. Accordingly, and following
completion of the block excavations,
archaeologists recovered a complete vertical
column of sediments from 3 to 5 mbs. This
vertical column was collected in 10-cm
increments from the northeast corner of Unit 13.
Finally, ¼-inch screened matrix from various
depths in Auger Tests 3, 4, and 5 were also
provided to Brown. His findings are reported
in Chapter 10.

Optically Stimulated
Luminescence (OSL) Samples
Twenty-four OSL samples were collected.
Twenty were collected every 6 cm down the
east wall profile of Unit 5 from 3 to 5 mbs. The
remaining four were collected from Units 5 and
12 to coincide with either features or unique
item stratigraphy. PVC pipe either 1 inch or 2
inches in diameter was cut into 10-inch lengths
and sharpened on one end. The PVC pipe was
placed perpendicular to the wall. Then, with a
2 x 6-inch piece of lumber covering the proximal
end, the PVC pipe was hammered and using a
4-pound mallet the full 10-inch length into the
wall. With a slight twist, the PVC pipe was

loosened enough so that it could be extracted
from the wall while the sediment sample inside
remained intact. To ensure that the sediment
stayed intact, both ends were tightly packed and
secured with opaque duct tape. Each pipe was
then labeled with the provenience, date, and an
arrow pointing to its distal end. Ten of the 24
samples were selected for OSL analysis and
sent to Feathers at the University of Washington
Luminescence Dating Laboratory.

5.3.6 Dismantling and Backfilling
The sequence that prepared the site for
excavation was reverse engineered to return
the site to its original condition as a rugby
field. Following the excavations, the framed
shoring was removed in one piece and
dismantled by the archaeological field crew.
The overburden was mechanically placed back
into the pit and entrance ramp from piles 3,
2, and 1, in that order. To alleviate the effects
of soil shrinkage and slumping, the backfilled
dirt was periodically compacted. Fences
were dismantled, all equipment and portable
buildings were removed, and the surface was
leveled, contoured, and re-sodded.

5.4	Laboratory Procedures
All artifacts and samples collected during
the course of our investigation were brought
back to the EComm laboratory in Austin for
preparation prior to analysis of the artifacts.
These preliminary preparations consisted of
inventory verification and cleaning and sorting
artifacts.
All bags of artifacts and samples were logged
on the Artifact Inventory Sheet as they were
collected in the field. All artifacts and samples
from the site were stored in large plastic
containers separate from each other. When
the artifacts arrived at the EComm office,
archaeologists working in the laboratory went
through the Artifact Inventory Sheet and
verified each bag listed. Once all the bags were
accounted for, the data recorded on the Artifact
Inventory Sheet was then transferred into an
Excel file.
All artifacts brought into the lab were cleaned
by washing and dry brushing. All artifacts were
then placed on drying racks. After the artifacts
had completely dried, they were sorted into
separate categories and documented, and were
then placed in clean new bags labeled with
their respective proveniences.
A second technician verified
the transcribed provenience
information.
The bags of soil matrix to be
used in the microsnail analysis
were physically sorted by
level (typically two bags per
level). Six 5-gallon buckets
were filled with about 2 L of
water and 10 milliliters (mL)
of sodium carbonate. The total
volume of all samples from
each level was recorded to the
nearest 0.25 L, and the soil was
put in the prepared 5-gallon
bucket. Sufficient water was
added to completely inundate
the soil, and then an additional
62

75 mL of sodium carbonate was added. These
buckets were left to sit overnight for the sodium
carbonate to dissolve the acidic bonds of the
clayey soil. The following day, the dissolved
sediments were wet screened through three
18-inch-diameter nested geologic sieves to
separate snails from the matrix. Sieve sizes
were No. 10 (2 mm), No. 18 (1 mm), and
No. 35 (0.5 mm). The sieves were set up on a
plywood template between two sawhorses, and
the dissolved soil was poured from each bucket
into the upper (No. 10) screen and then washed
though the three-screen stack with a water hose
and nozzle (Figure 5-24). The remnants of each
size range were put in a fine mesh (chiffon) bag
and air-dried. Using this approach, six samples
could be fully processed per eight-hour period.
Following analysis, all artifacts, sediments,
and special samples recovered from the handexcavated units were prepared for permanent
curation and submitted to TARL. Per an
agreement with the THC, all artifacts recovered
from the public screening area (i.e., from the
mechanically excavated upper 3 m) were
inventoried and returned to the City of Austin
for use in future interpretive exhibits.

Geoarchaeological Investigations
By Charles D. Frederick

6.1	Introduction
This chapter describes the alluvial sediments
exposed by the excavation, and attempts to
reconstruct changes that occurred at the site
throughout its history. The work incorporates
observations on the appearance as well as
the physical and chemical composition of the
alluvial deposits, and uses these to identify
how the landscape changed with time. It will be
shown that the Paleoindian-age occupations at
the site were initially situated quite close to the
Barton Creek channel, and in the period since
the first occupation the channel has moved to
the south away from the site.

6.2	Background
6.2.1 Alluvial Stratigraphy
of the Colorado River
The terrace deposits of the Colorado River
are the most extensively studied in the State
of Texas, with detailed descriptions starting in
the late nineteenth century and extending up
to the present day (e.g. Baker and PenteadoOrellana 1977; Blum 1992; Blum and Valastro
1992, 1994; Caran 1999; Caran et al. 1992;
Frederick 1987, 1988, 2006; Hill and Vaughan
1897, 1898; Looney 1977; Looney and Baker
1977; Mathis 1942; Robinson and Caran 1995;
Urbanec 1963; Weber 1968; Weeks 1945).
Comprehension of the age and stratigraphic
relationships of these terrace deposits has
gradually improved throughout this period, with
a reasonably well-dated alluvial chronology
emerging in the 1990s (specifically Blum 1992;
Blum and Valastro 1992; 1994).
Ecological Communications Corporation

The Colorado River terraces comprise a series
of step-like benches underlain by alluvial
sediments deposited by the Colorado River
and its tributaries. Each terrace comprises a
flat surface or terrace tread that is separated
from the next older terrace deposit by a steeper
slope segment or scarp. The youngest deposits
are the lowest, and the terrace age increases
with increasing tread elevation. The deposits
beneath any given terrace tread generally fine
upward from a gravel or sand at its base to a
finer-textured deposit (loam, silt loam, silty
clay loam, or clay) near the ground surface.
Although it was once thought that each distinct
terrace surface was underlain by alluvial
deposits of discrete age, recent work has
established that the Colorado River, as well
as most streams in the state of Texas, have
experienced brief periods of erosion alternating
with extensive periods of sedimentation, and
that alluvial deposits associated with more
than one period of sedimentation may be
present beneath a single terrace surface. The
most recent terrace deposits generally are of
variable texture (e.g. gravel, sand, silt, and
clay), but with the passage of time, the finergrained terrace sediments are gradually eroded
away, leaving behind only the coarsest-textured
sediments, which in the oldest terraces are
generally sand and gravel. The passage of time
also changes the composition and appearance
of the terrace deposits. Young alluvial deposits
exhibit little or no soil development and diverse
mineral assemblages, whereas older terraces
exhibit a much narrower range of composition
and prominently developed weathering or soil
profiles.

63

Chapter 6

Geoarchaeological Investigations

The terms assigned to the different elevation
terrace deposits have varied considerably
over the last century. For much of this period,
geologists assigned names to terraces that
were clearly expressed on the landscape, and
these names were revised from time to time as
different forms of analysis were applied to the
deposits. The most recent work on the Colorado
River terraces was completed by Michael Blum
(1992; Blum and Valastro 1994) soon after
the Ricklis et al. (1991) report was published.
This work employed a new approach to the
stratigraphy of the most recent Colorado River
deposits, whereby different-aged deposits were
organized by the unconformities that separate
them (a kind process called allostratigraphy)
and the degree of soil development was used
to distinguish deposits of presumably different
age. Blum also radiocarbon dated each deposit
directly. The approach permitted Blum to
completely restructure the terrace sequence
for the last 20,000 years and he introduced two
new names into the terrace nomenclature: the
Eagle Lake Alloformation and the Columbus
Bend Alloformation.
The Eagle Lake Alloformation was
radiocarbon dated by Blum to 18,600–15,600
BP, and generally is found beneath a distinct
terrace at the margin of the Holocene alluvial
valley. Following the deposition of the Eagle
Lake Alloformation, the Colorado River
experienced a period of pronounced erosion
during which time it deeply cut into its own
deposits and formed a new floodplain, into
which the sediments of the last 13,000 years
have been deposited. These deposits Blum
collectively referred to as the Columbus Bend
Alloformation, and he recognized three distinct
periods of sedimentation in this time frame that
he called Members 1, 2, and 3. The Columbus
Bend Alloformation Member 1 (CBA1)
is the oldest of these deposits and spans
approximately 13,000–5000 BP. Member 2 of
the Columbus Bend Alloformation (CBA2) is
inset into and often slightly buried by CBA1
and represents deposition by the Colorado River
between approximately 5000 and 1000 BP.
The youngest deposits of the Colorado River
64

are assigned to Columbus Bend Alloformation
Member 3 (CBA3), and represent alluvial
sedimentation by the Colorado River during
the last millennium. All of the radiocarbon ages
Blum obtained were from bulk sediment or
soil, and are therefore considered to be at best
approximations of the deposit ages, and the
chronology is incrementally improved as better
context radiocarbon ages become available,
which often comes during archaeological
excavations.

6.2.2 Previous Work at the
Vara Daniel Site
The alluvial deposits and their archaeological
inclusions to be impacted by the South Austin
Outfall project within Zilker Park have been
examined repeatedly during the last 22 years
(Collins et al. 1990; Espey Huston & Associates
1988; Nash et al. 2008; Ricklis et al. 1991;
Takac et al. 1992). Ricklis et al. (1991) mapped
the general extent of the alluvial deposits on the
basis of the local geomorphology, inspection of
seven trench exposures, and radiocarbon dating
and concluded that there are two distinctly
different-aged alluvial fills present at the site:
1) a late Pleistocene to Early Middle Holocene
alluvium, and 2) a late Holocene alluvium.
The older alluvial fill was found beneath the
higher of two terrace surfaces present within
the site and Zilker Park, where it was draped
by upwards of a meter or more of the late
Holocene alluvial deposit. The latter was found
to be upwards of 12 m thick beneath the lower
terrace surface.
When Blum worked on the Vara Daniel Site he
had not yet finalized the nomenclature of his
larger stratigraphic work, so the alloformation
names described previously do not appear in
the Ricklis et al. (1991) report. But the Ricklis
et al. (1991) report clearly notes that the site is
contained in what Blum interpreted as CBA1
(called the Latest Pleistocene to Early–Middle
Holocene Alluvium), and a younger deposit
(Late Holocene Alluvium) was inset into and
draped over the older one. The radiocarbon ages
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

Ricklis et al. (1991) obtained for the younger
deposit at the Vara Daniel Site demonstrate
that this deposit is what is what Blum later
recognized as CBA2.

6.3	Methods
6.3.1 Field Methods
Although the archaeological excavations
were limited to a 2-m section of deposits
between 3 and 5 mbs, a longer and more
complete stratigraphic column was desired for
characterizing the geological context of the
site. Hence, a complete profile was examined
from the ground surface to slightly more than
6 mbs. The top 3 m of the excavation was
described and sampled in 10-cm increments
from the east wall of the excavation, where
a narrow gap was left between the heavy
metal sheets that formed part of the shoring
for the trench excavation (see Figure 5-21).
The deposits exposed by the block excavation
were examined about halfway through the
fieldwork and revisited upon completion of
the block excavation, at which time the 2-m
section of alluvial deposits exposed by the
hand excavations was cleaned, described,
and sampled. A 1.2-m core (collected in two
segments) was then collected from the floor
of the excavation block with an Eijkelkamp
Percussion Drilling Set in order to examine
the basal deposits of the terrace. Coring was
terminated upon penetration refusal, which was
subsequently found to be gravelly sediment.
The cores were subsequently described and
split into 10-cm segments for laboratory
analysis. In the end, 61 bulk sediment samples
were collected from the east wall profile.
Deposits exposed by the excavation were
described in general accordance with the
methods described in Schoeneberger et al.
(2002), but the fundamental unit of field
observation was termed a zone, and soil
horizons for each zone were ascribed once
description was complete.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Coring
The scope for the geoarchaeological work
proposed to core the deposits in the immediate
vicinity of the block excavation in order to
establish a local stratigraphic baseline for the
terrace deposits. An Eijkelkamp Percussion
Drilling Set was used to core in and near
the excavation block immediately upon
completion of hand excavation. As noted
previously, a 1.2-m core was recovered from
the base of the block excavation and terminated
upon gravelly alluvium, and two additional
cores were attempted south of the block
excavation. Unfortunately, the extremely dry
conditions prevailing at the time of the coring
and accompanying very hard soil resulted in
penetration of only one meter in two locations,
and those two cores were terminated due to lack
of penetration. A more robust coring apparatus
would have been necessary to penetrate these
deposits at this time.

6.3.2 Lab Methods
Physical and chemical characterization of
the deposits revealed by the excavation was
undertaken in order to better understand the
detailed depositional history of the site. This
work entailed determination of the particle size
distribution, calcium carbonate content, organic
carbon content, the magnetic susceptibility,
and the stable carbon isotopic composition
of the organic carbon. An attempt was also
made to reconstruct which stream dominated
deposition throughout the formation of the
terrace (sediment source determination).

Particle Size Analysis (Texture)
Texture analysis was performed using the
hydrometer-sieve method (cf. American
Society for Testing Materials 1985; Bouyoucos
1962; Gee and Bauder 1986). Samples were
first weighed moist and then gently passed
through a 2-mm sieve. When more than 200
grams (g) of < 2-mm sediment was obtained,
the remainder of the sample was transferred
to a 100-mL beaker and a 5 percent sodium
65

Chapter 6

Geoarchaeological Investigations

hexametaphosphate solution was added to
break down the clays and to permit separation
of the > 2-mm artifacts and gravels. After
soaking for 2 days, during which time the
samples were repeatedly stirred, the samples
were wet sieved through a 2-mm sieve and the
coarse fraction separated and dried. Coarse
material caught on the 2-mm sieve, if detrital
sediment (and not artifactual), was then sieved
at a 1-phi interval and the mass on each sieve
recorded. A split of the < 2-mm-sized material
(roughly 70 g) was then soaked in 50 mL of a
5 percent sodium hexametaphosphate solution
overnight, and then mixed in a mechanical
mixer for 5 minutes before being diluted to
1 L with distilled water. This mixture was
placed in a 1-L settling jar, mechanically
agitated for 1 minute, and then set on a table,
after which point hydrometer readings were
made a different time intervals (specifically 1,
3.5, 15, 45, 300, and 1440 minutes). A control
hydrometer and temperature reading on an
empty jar with nothing but distilled water and
the sodium hexametaphosphate solution was
made at intervals throughout the analysis to
permit calibration of the hydrometer. A small
split of the < 2-mm soil (around 20–30 g) was
also oven dried to determine the moisture
content and correct the sample mass used in
the hydrometer analysis (hygroscopic moisture
correction). After 24 hours, the contents of
the hydrometer jar were wet sieved through a
37-µ sieve, and the sand retained on the sieve
was transferred to a beaker and oven dried at
105˚C. Once dry, this sand was subsequently
sieved at 0.5-phi intervals and the mass
retained on each sieve recorded. From these
data the percentage of gravel, sand, silt, and
clay, as well as various descriptive statistics
(e.g., mean, standard deviation (sorting),
skewness, and kurtosis), were calculated for
the grain size distribution using a spreadsheet
written by Paul Lehman.

Calcium Carbonate Equivalent (CCE)
A small split (either 1.70 g or 0.85 g) of the
ground < 2-mm fraction of each soil sample
was used to determine the calcium carbonate
66

equivalent (CCE) by means of a Chittick
apparatus (Dreimanis 1962; Machette 1986).
This sample was finely ground (to pass a
0.075-mm sieve), and then weighed and placed
into a small (250 mL) Erlenmeyer flask. Once
attached to the Chittick apparatus, the liquid
level in the measuring burette was set to -10
mL, then the stopcock was closed so no gas
could leave the system, and the leveling bulb
was dropped in order to establish a vacuum
inside the sample chamber. At this point
the barometric pressure and temperature in
the room were recorded. Then 10 mL of 50
percent hydrochloric acid (ca. 6 N HCl) was
delivered to the sample flask, which was
agitated intermittently until the reaction had
ceased (usually 1–2 minutes). At this point, the
leveling bulb was raised to the point that the
liquid level inside of it was equal in elevation
to the liquid in the burette, and the volume of
gas evolved was then measured and the CCE
calculated.

Magnetic Susceptibility
Dry sediment samples that had been sieved to
remove the > 2-mm-size material were packed
into 2.5-cm plastic cubes, weighed, and then
the low frequency (470 Hz) and high frequency
(4700 Hz) magnetic susceptibility (kappa)
was measured in SI units (10-8m3kg-1) on the
0.1 setting on a Bartington MS2 meter and an
MS2b sensor.
The mass corrected magnetic susceptibility
(χlf) and coefficient of frequency dependency
(χfd) were then calculated. The coefficient
of frequency dependency (χfd) is the percent
difference in magnetic susceptibility measured
at low and high frequencies.1 Elevated values
of χfd (ca. > 10%; Gale and Hoare 1991:213)
are indicative of increased concentrations of
fine-grained ferrimagnetic minerals, most
often maghemite, in top soils (Dearing et al.
1996). In this particular setting, sediment from
the Colorado River generally exhibits higher
magnetic susceptibility owing to its more

Carbon Isotopic Composition
In order to determine the carbon content of
each sample, small splits of calcium carbonatefree < 2-mm size fraction were submitted to

Geoarchaeological Investigations

the Stable Isotope Research Unit (SIRU) in the
Department of Crop and Soil Science at Oregon
State University. Before being sent to the
Oregon State University lab, calcium carbonate
was removed from the samples by treating a
small amount (generally about a 2-g split) of
the < 2-mm-size soil with 6 N hydrochloric
acid. Acid was added to each sample until the
effervescent reaction stopped, and then the
beaker was then filled with water and allowed
to sit 5 hours or until the supernant liquid was
clear, and then decanted and subsequently
refilled three times to remove all traces of acid.
After the third rinse, the decanted sample was
dried at 105˚C, and subsequently finely ground.
Methods used in the SIRU at Oregon State
University are described below (Rockie
Yarwood, personal communication; 2010).
Samples were analyzed for total C and 13C
on a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (SerCon, Crewe, UK) interfaced
with a PDZ Europa RoboPrep elemental
analyzer (EA/IRMS). To determine the percent
carbon, the dry sample material was weighed
to three decimal places (1 µg) on a Cahn
microbalance prior to combustion. Stable
isotope ratios were reported in delta notation as
parts per thousand (per mille) deviation from
the international standard V-PDB (versus Pee
Dee Belemite). Typical precision for the IRMS
is < 0.2 per mille for δ13C. To correct for possible
drift in the EA/IRMS combination with time,
drift correction standards of equal mass were
run every 10 samples. The laboratory standard
used was the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference
Material (SRM) 1547 peach leaves (45.54% C,
δ13C V-PDB -25.99). Additional standards were
run as dummy samples for every 10 samples,
and the values obtained are reported along with
the sample results. As quality assurance, NIST
SRM 1547 peach leaves were occasionally
analyzed against a standard certified for C,
N, 13C, and 15N (Elemental Microanalysis
B2157 wheat flour, batch no. 2823) that has
been calibrated against International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA)-CH-6 for carbon and
IAEA-N-1 for nitrogen.

Sediment Source Determination
The location of the site at the confluence of
the Colorado River and Barton Creek dictates
that the alluvial deposits present will be
derived from one or both streams depending
upon which stream was in flood at any given
moment in the past. Given the size and location
of the two stream catchments it is possible
for each stream to flood independently of the
other depending upon the location of extreme
rainfall events, but how often independent
flooding occurred is difficult to say. When the
Colorado River flooded, its flood waters would
have backed up into the Barton Creek valley,
resulting in the deposition of thin beds of red
colored sediment. Individual slack water flood
deposits (also known as vertical accretion
deposits) usually consist of thin, fining upwards
beds of sediment that have a coarse basal bed
(typically sandy) that grades upward into a silt
or clay, but if the floodwater column is shallow,
the coarse part of the couplet may be silty
rather than sandy. Previous work in the Austin
area described this process in detail for deeply
buried late Pleistocene alluvial sediments (cf.
Frederick 1987; 1988). Although the alluvial
deposits exposed within the block excavation
of the Vara Daniel Site were probably similar
to this originally, post-depositional processes
(such as the action of worms and roots) appear
to have obliterated visible evidence except at
the very base of the terrace.
Determining which stream dominated
sedimentation at any point in the stratigraphic
sequence is approachable by various
mineralogical methods owing to the different
geology of the two stream catchments.
Barton Creek drains Lower Cretaceous-age
limestones of the Edwards Group and Glen
Rose Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology
1974), and therefore its alluvium is dominated
by calcite and a minor amount of siliceous
material, largely derived from chert within the
Edwards Group limestones and small outcrops
of ancient Colorado River terraces present
near the mouth of the stream. The Colorado
River has a much larger catchment and drains
a diverse geological landscape that includes
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

the same deposits exposed in the Barton Creek
catchment, but that contains considerably more
lithological diversity in its headwaters (see
discussions in Bradley 1970; Sneed and Folk
1958). The Colorado River derives its name
from the color of its floodwaters, which were
dominated by red sediment liberated by erosion
from the Permian-Triassic–age red beds on the
Rolling Plains immediately east of Big Spring
and the Southern High Plains (Llano Estacado).
But in its course across Central Texas the
Colorado also picks up plutonic igneous and
metamorphic rocks from the Llano Uplift
region. Hence, the lithology of the Colorado
River deposits is significantly different from
Barton Creek in that it is significantly more
siliceous and contains less carbonate rock
fragments.
Given the clear mineralogical differences
present between the two streams, estimating the
relative contribution of the two streams to any
given deposit should be possible. Methods that
could be used to accomplish this goal include
analysis of the bulk mineralogy, the heavy
mineral assemblage, or relative percentage
carbonate rock fragments. Because the first
two are relatively time consuming, the calcium
carbonate content (more specifically the CCE)
was chosen for an expedient method to assess
variations in sediment source through time.
The calcium carbonate content is relatively
easily measured (described previously), and to
be used this in this capacity it was necessary to
obtain representative sediment samples, from
each stream. Samples from Barton Creek were
collected from just downstream of Campbell’s
Hole (UTM Zone 14, 616827E 3348258N
NAD83) approximately 1.1 miles upstream of
the site, which appears to be beyond the point
that the Colorado River could flood back up the
Barton Creek valley. Colorado River deposits
were sampled from a cutbank of Little Walnut
Creek where it is crossed by US highway 183
at the northern margin of the Colorado River
valley (UTM Zone 14, 627720E 3348706N
NAD83). The left creek bank immediately
east of the highway bridge exposes about 4 m
of what appear to be early Holocene alluvial
Ecological Communications Corporation

deposits of the Colorado River (CBA1). From
each exposure two samples were collected:
one fine (mud) and one coarse (sandy). For
each the calcium carbonate was determined for
the bulk sample and for the fine sand fraction
(3–4 phi). The calcium carbonate content was
also determined for the bulk soil and fine sand
fraction of the deposits collected at the site
(Figure 6-1). The CCE of the fine sand was
used as the discriminating measure of sediment
source. The Barton Creek samples contained
more than 89 percent CCE, whereas the
Colorado River sands contained less than 14
percent, and these two values were then used as
end members to estimate sediment source, with
samples containing less than 14 percent CCE
considered to be 100 percent Colorado River
sediment, and samples containing more than 89
percent CCE being 100 percent Barton Creek
source. Using this scale, the samples from
the east wall profile were then classified as
either dominantly Barton Creek or dominantly
Colorado River, with the dominance determined
by a simple majority (> 50%).
It should be noted that pedogenic alteration
of the sediment, specifically redistribution
of calcium carbonate, may slightly skew this
interpretation in two ways. First, infiltrating
rainwater dissolves calcium carbonate in
top soils, so in the uppermost deposits this
process may bias against Barton Creek source
determinations. Second, the reprecipitation of
dissolved calcium carbonate at depth in the
Bk or calcic soil horizon may increase the
calcium carbonate content at depth, thereby
biasing against Coloroado River. Although
these processes have undoubtedly affected
this profile, they do not appear to dramatically
affect the interpretation of the sediment source.

are described in Table 6-1 and lab data

in this deposit was relatively high
(1.6%) but the deposit exhibited
no
significant
melanization
(darkening), which suggests that
this is detrital organic carbon, not
pedogenic. The depth to bedrock
and the thickness of this gravelly
channel deposit are unknown.

6.4.2 Zone 14 (596 to
601 cmbs; ~11,755 BP)

This thin bed of yellowish red
loam is a Colorado River flood
drape that rests unconformably
on top of Zone 15. Given the
general dominance of Barton
Creek deposits in this part of
the profile, this mud drape
was clearly deposited during a
Colorado River flood that backed
up the Barton Creek valley when
the flood waters of Barton Creek
were hydraulically dammed by
the Colorado River. The color
and magnetic susceptibility of
this deposit clearly reflect the
Colorado River influence, but
the calcium carbonate content of
this sediment suggests that the
dominant source was still Barton
Creek.

6.4.3 Zones 11, 12,
and 13 (491 to 596 cmbs;
~10,905–11,670 BP)

These three zones comprise a
body of fining upward reddish
yellow (base) to yellowish red
(top) loam to sandy loam that was
probably deposited on a point bar
along the margin of the Barton
Creek channel. The increasingly
red color, decreasing calcium
carbonate content, and increasing
magnetic susceptibility indicate

that the influence of the Colorado River
increased through time as the bar height
increased. The organic carbon content
decreased upwards through this deposit,
which may also be due to the Colorado
River influence. Small amounts of limestone
gravel were present within these deposits
and the uniform lithology suggests that they
were derived from Barton Creek.

6.4.4
Zones 9 and 10
(433 to 491 cmbs;
~10,395–10,905 BP)
This section of the deposit encompasses
the lower part of the block excavation
and comprises a fining upward body of
sediment (reddish brown silt loam (base)
to reddish brown silty clay loam (top) that
appears to represent the transition from a
point bar of Barton Creek to a floodplain.
The center of Zone 10 is the point where
the maximum lithic debris was recovered
within the block excavation (Analytical
Unit 3) and these occupations are likely to
have been situated at the rear of a point bar
relatively close to the channel of Barton
Creek at that time (certainly much closer
than the site is today). While the presence
of small amounts of limestone gravel
clearly indicate that the surface was still
occasionally inundated by large floods of
Barton Creek, it is in this section of the
profile that the dominant sediment source
shifts from Barton Creek to the Colorado
River. The alternating values of magnetic
susceptibility within this deposit are most
likely due to variations in sediment source,
with Barton Creek sediments having lower
values than the Colorado River sediments.
In the field, Zone 9 was noticeably darker
colored (a subtle shift to a lower chroma)
and it was speculated that this may
represent a faint or weakly developed
paleosol (buried soil A horizon). But
neither the organic carbon nor the magnetic
susceptibility, both of which typically

exhibit higher values in stable surface soils,
supported this inference. Zone 9 is among the
finest textured sediments in the site, and the
lower chroma is likely the result of more clay
within this deposit.
It should be noted that all of the sediments
above this point were deposited in a floodplain
setting.

6.4.5 Zones 6 (lower), 7, and
8 (280 to 433 cmbs;
8401–10,310 BP)
This section of the deposit comprises a broad
fining upward body of sediment and represents
the upper part of the block excavation and
contains Analytical Units (AU) 1 and 2. The
lower half of Zone 8 exhibits an increase in
the texture (primarily an increase in sand
and a subtle decrease in clay), and the main
occupation in AU 2 is situated just below the
coarsest textured part of this transition zone.
From 375 to 275 cmbs, the deposit steadily
becomes finer textured from a reddish brown
loam to a clay loam. The lower part of this
appears to be dominated by the Colorado River,
but the upper half appears to have been more
strongly influenced by Barton Creek. Analytical
Unit 1 is situated within the sediments that are
most strongly influenced by Barton Creek.
Magnetic susceptibility values rise steadily
throughout this section in tandem with a subtle
increase in organic carbon that peaks around
305 cmbs, which suggests that the middle and
upper part of this fining upward trend in the
deposit may have experienced a minor degree
of soil development, although this was not
visible in the field in the form of melanization
or darkening of the sediment.

6.4.6 Upper Zone 6 (205 to 280
cmbs; 6565–8171 BP)
The deposits in the upper part of zone 6 are
all reddish brown loams, but these deposits
coarsen upward and two prominent pulses
74

of coarser sediment are present within this
section, one at 260 cmbs and another at 215
cmbs. These may represent individual large
floods or periods when larger magnitude floods
were more common. Throughout this portion
of the profile the magnetic susceptibility drops
and there is a peak in the bulk sediment calcium
carbonate content, which at first glance suggests
an increase in Barton Creek flooding, but the
calcium carbonate content of the fine sand
does not support this interpretation. It is in this
portion of the profile that greatest frequency of
pedogenic calcium carbonate nodules occurs
and the increase in bulk calcium carbonate
content may be due to pedogenic additions
rather than detrital influx from flooding by
Barton Creek.

6.4.7 Zones 4 (lower) and
5 (115 to 205 cmbs;
4500–6336 BP)
This portion of the profile is thought to comprise
the upper part of CBA1. This interpretation is
based on the clear rise in organic carbon that
peaks around 115 cmbs and clearly suggests the
development of a soil A-horizon, but the color
of the deposit did not suggest this in the field.
The texture through most of this portion of
the profile fines upward, but abruptly coarsens
slightly between 110 and 120 cmbs. The
magnetic susceptibility and bulk CCE appear
to vary inversely, and calcium carbonate peaks
between 120 and 140 cmbs in both the bulk
and fine sand fractions, suggesting that this is
probably due to flooding by Barton Creek.
Bulk sediment radiocarbon dating by Blum
(1992; Blum and Valastro 1994) places the end
of deposition of CBA1 at approximately 5000
BP and the onset CBA2 around the same time.
Blum et al. (1994:10) suggest that widespread
burial of the CBA1 surface occurred around
2000–2500 BP. Although there are no
radiocarbon ages for this section of the profile,
an age of about 4500 BP was assumed for
the sediment immediately above the peak in
organic carbon.

6.4.8 Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4
(upper) (0 to 115 cmbs;
1200–4500 BP)
The upper 115 cm of the profile is interpreted
as CBA2, the deposition of which Blum (1992)
places in the period between 5000 and about
1000 BP. Radiocarbon ages on charcoal from
good context cultural features since Blum’s
dissertation have found that the youngest
alluvial fill on the Colorado (CBA3) began
forming slightly earlier, perhaps as early
as 1250 BP (see Quigg et al. 1996), which
indicates that CBA2 deposition ended slightly
before this point.
This portion of the profile is dominated by
a dramatic increase in organic carbon and
concomitant melanization (darkening) of the
deposit (a soil A-horizon), subtle variations in
texture, and significant variation in the magnetic
susceptibility and calcium carbonate, the latter
two again varying inversely. The differences in
calcium carbonate content are most likely due
to variations in the sediment source, with a peak
in calcium carbonate occurring in both fine
sand and bulk soil between 25 and 65 cmbs, but
the low values either side of this peak are lower
than elsewhere in the profile and probably
have been somewhat affected by leaching
by percolating rainwater, which is common
in the upper part of the soil profile formed in
CBA2 (and correlative deposits) elsewhere in
the Colorado River catchment (see profiles in
Blum et al. 1994:7).
There was no evidence of any significant
sedimentation during the last millennium at this
site, but incremental additions to this cumulic A
horizon cannot be ruled out.

6.4.9 Summary
The alluvial deposits exposed by the block
excavation at the Vara Daniel Site show that the

Ecological Communications Corporation

earliest occupations at the site, the Paleoindian
materials in Analytical Unit 3, appear to
have been located near the channel of Barton
Creek, at the interface between the point bar
and floodplain. Subsequent occupations were
located on the floodplain, and it appears that
in the period since the earliest occupation the
channel of Barton Creek has gradually moved to
the south and its present position. Sedimentation
at the site was initially dominated by Barton
Creek, but once the floodplain was established,
floods by both streams inundated the site from
time to time, balthough the Colorado River
appears to have been to dominant sediment
source throughout much of the post-Paleoindian
(Holocene) period at the site.
The only evidence of soil development
observed within these deposits in the field is
the modern soil, which consists of a mollic
epipedon near the ground surface, and a calcic
horizon in the subsurface that contains minor
amounts of pedogenic calcium carbonate.
However, close analysis of the sediments
suggests at least one and possibly two incipient
soils had formed in these deposits during brief
pauses in sedimentation during the Holocene.
The most prominent of these is around 115–200
cmbs, where there is a small but quite distinct
increase in organic carbon, and this most likely
represents an incipient top soil (or A horizon)
at the interface between CBA1 and CBA2,
which probably formed during the period that
the Colorado River channel incised and a new
floodplain was being formed. Normally, such
soil horizons retain visible expression, but
it is not clear why this one did not. A second
place where minor pedogenic enhancement
was noted is around 300–360 cmbs where
there is a slight increase in organic carbon and
magnetic susceptibility, but as before, there
was no clear expression of this presumed soil
that was visible in the field. There was no field
or analytical evidence of long-term stable
surfaces within the hand-excavated portion of
the block excavation.

6.5	Regional Vegetation
Inferred through
Stable Carbon Isotopes
As part of the analytical work for this study
the stable carbon isotopic composition of
organic carbon within each of 61 soil/sediment
samples was determined in order to evaluate
the general trajectory of vegetation change
within this region. The alluvial deposits, as
previously described, were deposited by both
the Colorado River and its tributary, Barton
Creek, and range from channel and point bar
sediments in the lowest meter and a half of the
profile to floodplain sediments from there to
the modern ground surface.
The stable carbon isotopic composition of
soil organic carbon has been used as a proxy
record of vegetation change for some time in
late Quaternary sediments (e.g., Cerling et
al. 1989; Nordt et al. 1994, 2002), and this
approach is predicated upon the fact that
two of the three photosynthetic pathways
employed by plants (specifically C3 and C4)
differ significantly in the carbon isotopic
composition owing to differences in the way
these photosynthetic pathways fractionate 13C.
Plants using the C3 photosynthetic pathway,
such as trees, shrubs, forbs, and cool-season
grasses, generally yield δ13C between -20 and
-32 per mil with a mean value of -27 per mil.
C4 plants (primarily warm-season grasses)
discriminate less against 13CO2,, thereby
yielding δ13C values in the range between -9 to
-17 per mil with mean values around -13 per
mil. Because these values are retained in the
soil organic carbon pool with little variation,
stratigraphic variation in δ13C may be used as
a way of estimating the relative productivity
of C3 to C4 plants through time. Previous
North American studies have shown that the
proportion of C4 plants in grassland vegetation
is strongly correlated with temperature (Teeri
and Stowe 1976) and for this reason the
variation percentage C4 biomass obtained
from stratigraphic records is often inferred to

76

represent a proxy for past temperature, as well
as approximate abundance of C4 plants.

6.5.1 Samples Used in
this Analysis
The soil formed in the calcium carbonate rich
alluvial deposits at the Vara Daniel Site is a
mollisol that exhibits an A-Bk-C soil profile,
where the calcic horizon contains thread-like
(filamentous) forms as well as small nodules.
The calcium carbonate content of the sediments
ranges from 100 percent in the Barton Creek
channel sediments near the base of the profile
to 35 percent at the top of the profile, where
deposition by the Colorado River prevailed.
Organic carbon values range from 4.4 percent
at the modern surface to 0.2 percent in the
middle of the profile, and are significantly
elevated at the top and bottom of the profile.
No prominent buried soils were noted in
the field exposures, but trends in the depth
variation of organic carbon suggest pedogenic
enrichment of the deposit may have occurred
at the top of the profile (modern surface to
~100 cmbs (Zones 1, 2, and 3); 115 to ~200
cmbs (Zones 4 and 5), and possibly 300–360
cmbs (Zones 6 (lower) and 7). The carbon
in this profile is most likely detrital in lower
part of the profile and dominantly pedogenic
in the top. Previous work in the Central Texas
region (Nordt et al. 2002:183) has argued that
both sources should provide a similar record
of paleovegetation.
Methods employed were described previously,
and the relative proportion of buried soil
organic carbon derived from C4 plants follows
Nordt et al. (2002) and was estimated by the
mass balance equation:
δ13Csoil = (δ13C C4)(x) + (δ13C C3)(1-x)
where δ13Csoil is the δ13C of paleosol/ancient
sediment, δ13C C4 is the average δ13C of C3
plants (-13 per mil), δ13C C4 is the average
of C3 plants (-27 per mil), x is the relative

proportion of carbon from C4 plant sources,
and 1-x is the relative proportion of carbon
from C3 plant sources.
The chronology for the sequence was
established by means of bulk sediment/soil
organic carbon radiocarbon ages obtained
from various points in the profile during the
block excavation, and a few of these ages
were rejected as obviously incorrect. The
radiocarbon and inferred ages used to estimate
the age of each 10-cm level are listed in Table
6-3, and the ages assigned to each 10-cm level
are listed in Table 6-2. No charcoal ages were
obtained from the excavation.

6.5.2 Results
The sequence appears to span the last 12,000
years, and during this period the δ13C of soil
organic carbon ranged from -24.7 to -11.7 per
mil PDB (see the black line on Figure 6-3 and
Figure 6-2). This indicates that the vegetation
here, like that elsewhere in Central Texas, varied
from strongly C3 dominated to completely C4.
The general trends within the data bear a strong
resemblance to the carbon isotopic record
obtained from alluvial deposits of the Medina
River south of San Antonio (Nordt et al. 2002),
but differ in detail.
The earliest part of the sequence exhibits
large and rapid fluctuations between 12,000
and about 11, 500 BP, when C4 plants account
for less than half of the organic carbon
present, suggesting that temperatures were
depressed, but possibly fluctuating rapidly and
significantly. A rapid increase in C4 biomass
(and presumably a warmer climate) appears to
have occurred between 11,500 and 11,200 BP,
after which C4 plants accounted for between 50
percent and 70 percent of the organic carbon
until around 10,000 BP, after which values
rapidly fell for a brief period. After 9500 BP
the δ13C began a steady rise that peaked at -13
per mil around 5500 BP, presumably during
the height of the Altithermal, when nearly all
of the organic carbon appears to have derived

from C4 sources. This is a significantly greater
proportion of C4 plants than was observed by
Nordt et al. 2002 for the Medina River, but the
peak in temperature appears around the same
period. The values observed at the Vara Daniel
Site are very comparable to those observed at
Fort Hood by Nordt et al. (1994) in this period.
Between 5000 and 3500 BP the proportion
of organic carbon contributed by C3 plants
increased about 10 percent and slightly cooler
temperatures may be inferred, but that was
followed by another period of nearly complete
C4 dominance between 3500 and 2000 BP.
The latter period is similar to the Medina
River record, where the greatest temperatures
apparently occurred after the Altithermal, yet
dissimilar from the Fort Hood record, where the
same period appears to be cooler. After 2000
BP the proportion of organic carbon derived
from C4 plants steadily decreases, ending at the
modern ground surface which most recently
appears to have most recently obtained about 65
percent of its organic carbon from C4 sources.

isotopic data obtained from the Vara Daniel
Site with the record from the Medina River

in from both, which may be an artifact of
geography as this locality is approximately
halfway between the Medina River study and

Site Stratigraphy and Integrity
By David L. Nickels

This chapter presents multiple lines of evidence
that indicate the age of layered sediments
obtained from soil organic carbon (humics
and humins) and OSL sample assays. Other
data used to evaluate the vertical integrity
of sediment packages are unmodified, noncultural rocks, magnetic soil susceptibility
values, soil pH values, and the chipped stone
assemblage data.

within the block were drawn, described,
and photographed. Soil profiles within the
excavation pit were limited due to extensive
metal shoring or plywood (see Chapter 5). For
reference, a diagram of the excavation block is
shown in Figure 5-18. Figure 7-1 is a profile of
the west walls of Units 3, 6, 11, and 14 through
the center of the block. Exterior wall profiles
are shown in Appendix D. Although a much
more detailed discussion of the stratigraphy
can be found in Chapter 6, two observations
should be emphasized here. The first is that
Soil Zone IV, which is predominantly a coarse
gravel matrix, was exposed in the lower
levels of all units except Unit 5. During the

excavations it appeared that the gravel lens
thickened from east to west, and these profiles
confirm it. Second, no unconformities were
observed throughout the profiles, suggesting
uninterrupted
pedogenic
and
alluvial
deposition processes.
The excavation block penetrated and
documents a classic fining-upward point bar
sequence. This wasn’t readily apparent in the
field because of the shoring, and because part
of the evidence came only from coring; but
it is obvious from textural data presented in
Chapter 6. The bottom part of the sequence
consists of Barton Creek channel fill (gravel),
overlain by fining-upward sand and silt, from
6.2 m up to about 4.5 m. These are lateral
accretion deposits, and deposition rates would
have been much higher than above 4.5 m.
The next package, from about 4.5 m up to
about 3.7 m, is mostly silt and is full of juvenile
aquatic snails. This evidently accumulated in
a closed or semi-closed basin of some sort,
either a floodbasin behind a levee, or an
oxbow abandoned by migration of Barton
Creek. Frederick calls this “transitional,”
while K. Brown calls it a “floodbasin.” It
really is transitional in a sense, so whether it
is considered as part of the lateral accretion
deposits or part of the vertical accretion
deposits is a matter of perspective. These
would have been shallow ponds that held
standing water for short periods—too muddy
to use as an occupational site unless really dry.
In either case, from about 3.7 m up (if not
from 4.5 m), the rest of the sequence is
vertical accretion deposits, and from this
point up, the floodplain surface would have
been high enough, dry enough, and vegetated
enough to serve as a suitable campsite—but
the depositional rates would have been much
slower than earlier.
This difference in geologic processes between
lateral accretion point bar deposits and
vertical accretion terrace deposits should
have a direct effect on the variation in both
80

cultural and non-cultural material found in
the sediments, such as ostracods, chert flakes,
snails, mussel shells, bones, hackberry seeds,
and so forth. The processes by which these
arrived at the site were probably different in
the lower versus upper sediments, and the
amount of dispersal and dilution by sediment
was probably different as well.
In the case of the snails, K. Brown surmises
that hardly any of the snails found in the point
bar sediments (except possibly some of the
amphibious ones) were actually resident on
the point bar, because point bars are not good
places for most snails too live; the habitat is
too disturbed. More likely they washed down
from streambanks a short distance upstream.
Snails above 3.7 m were probably resident
(although a few were probably brought in by
occasional floods, especially the aquatic ones).
In other words, the geology has a profound
effect on not just the paleoenvironmental data,
but also the cultural data.
One implication of this is that any chert flakes
found in the point bar sediments would not be
the result of toolworking in a residential area,
but might be the result of people walking down
onto the point bar surface to test cobbles, or
maybe just to carry out chert working adjacent
to a campsite, the point bar being viewed as
an open area where debitage discard would
not be hazardous to occupation. They might
have been collecting cobbles at the foot of the
point bar and then testing them on the point
bar surface. Based on the geology alone, we
would expect a shift from primary debris to
more secondary and tertiary chipping debris
going upsection.

7.2	Chronometric
Sequences
7.2.1 Bulk Sediment Dates
Other than tiny bits (< 0.01 g) found in
flotation samples, no charcoal was recovered.
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Therefore, fourteen bulk sediment samples
were selected for possible extraction of
microcharcoal and submitted to Beta Analytic
(Appendix E). No microcharcoal was present in
any of the samples; they were then subjected to
an acid wash, and organic bulk sediment dates
were obtained using both humics and humans,
humics being from primary soil development
and humins being void of detrital carbon
from the source. The average of the two best
approximates the age. Table 7-1 synthesizes
the results of bulk sediment and OSL dates
obtained during this project, along with a
straight interpolation of conventional 14C dates.
As illustrated in Figure 7-2, with rare exception,
the bulk sediment dates get progressively older
with depth, indicating a high degree of vertical
integrity from 3 to 5 mbs.
As is often the case at other sites, the use
of bulk sediment dates at the Vara Daniel
Site as valid indicators of age is admittedly
problematic. Problems with using bulk
sediment dates are generally attributed to
the unknown quantities of both organic and
carbon remaining in the soil from detrital and/
or pedogenic sources. For further discussions
of how bulk sediment dates do not necessarily
coincide with either calibrated or uncalibrated
charcoal dates, see Chapters 6, 9, and 12.

7.2.2 Optically Stimulated
Luminescence (OSL) Dates
The reliability of OSL dates as near absolute
has been the subject of much debate since
its inception. Archaeologists have used OSL
dating techniques to help resolve the sandy
mantle problem (Rodgers 1994; Rodgers and
Foster 1994; Ricklis 2001). OSL dating, based
on the same principles as thermoluminescence
dating, uses specific light frequencies to release
the stored luminescence within mineral grains.
The debate is most succinctly stated in two
articles published in Current Archeology in
Texas. Bruseth and Martin (2001) argue that
the sandy mantle is the result of pedogenesis
Ecological Communications Corporation

and that pedoturbation processes displace
artifacts. In response to this position is the
rebuttal by Frederick and Bateman (2001).
They present data that suggest there is good
internal consistency between stratigraphy and
OSL dates. Although arguments can be made
from both sides depending on site formation
processes and disturbances, it is clear that OSL
dating, linked with other forms of analysis, is
potentially informative and may represent a
valid analytical tool. Just as 14C dates can be
problematic in fluvial settings due to reworking,
OSL ages from fluvial deposits may have
problems due to partial bleaching.
Twenty-four OSL samples were collected, and
10 were submitted for analysis to Feathers at
the University of Washington’s Luminescence
Dating Laboratory. The dates obtained from
OSL are included in Table 7-1 and are illustrated
in Figure 7-2. A list of all 24 samples can be
found in Appendix F.

7.2.3 Agreement on a
Consensual Dating
Scheme for this Project
For purposes of a coherent discussion
throughout, it was necessary that all authors
critically analyze the bulk sediment dates,
consider their potential for error, and if justified,
present their reasoning for varying from these
dates.
K. Brown opines that depth-age modeling
for the vertical terrace accretion deposits
should use as much information as possible.
Therefore, he estimated the modern ground
surface as 100 BP, and used selected bulk
sediment dates from this project plus three of
four PBS&J assays derived from their nearby
auger tests to establish a depth-age model
somewhat different than that used by Frederick
and D. Brown. All of these assays were done
by the same lab, on the same kind of material,
using the same procedures, and all the samples
came from a spatially restricted area. Note that
in Chapter 10, K. Brown has elected to use his

Frederick (Chapter 6) generally agrees with
this interpolation primarily because it moreso
agrees with his soils profile and cooborating
solid dates obtained from Blum’s (1992)
study of the Columbus Bend Alloformation
Members 1, 2, and 3. In Chapter 9, Tomka uses
lithic assemblage and associated provenience
data, magnetic soil susceptibility data, and
bulk humate radiocarbon assays to delineate
analytical units (AUs), which are defined as
“spatial constructs that contain the artifacts of
one or more occupations; finer seriation into
individual occupations is unlikely because of
the excavation techniques and the likelihood
of some artifact movement in the sediments.”
Although Tomka uses calibrated bulk
sediment dates in Chapter 9, he can accept the
interpolated dates because they are generally
within the ranges of Early Archaic through
possibly Clovis-age chipped stone analytical
units. For a thorough review of radiocarbon
years, both calibrated and uncalibrated, and the
problems in comparing them and interpolating
them to coincide with various other global
data sets, see Brown 2006:216–237.

7.3	Landscape Stability/
Instability
Chapter 4 provides a discussion that suggests
colluvium represents more localized rainfall
and slope erosion, while alluvial deposits
not only suggest localized rainfall, but could
also represent runoff remotely upstream from
the site. In this case, fragmented and jagged
colluvial material at the site would be derived
84

from Lower Cretaceous-age limestone present
in the Barton Creek catchment zone, and from
the limestone escarpment at the western edge
of the area studied. The Colorado River, on the
other hand, would deposit well-rounded gravels
of more diverse mineralogy, mostly siliceous.
All natural, non-cultural rocks were collected.
Rocks from Units 5–8 were sorted into three
categories: 1) colluvial in nature, fractured
limestone with jagged edges; 2) alluvial in
nature, well rounded, some degree of core or
rind formation, probably chert; and 3) calcium
carbonate chunks. Each category was then
size sorted, counted, and weighed, and the
inventories are presented in Appendix G.

Following that time, there appears to be
brief, alternating periodic episodes of highvelocity erosion interspersed with periods
of landscape stability through 9817 BP.
These episodes are evident between 4.1
and 4.9 mbs, and for the most part correlate
with Frederick’s Stratigraphic Zone 10.
He points out that during this period the
immediate area was transitioning from a
point bar of Barton Creek to a floodplain,
with shifting inundations by both Barton
Creek and the Colorado River. Nevertheless,
it is within this zone that Tomka (Chapter
9; see Figure 6-1) recognizes an isoluble,
AU 3 composed of lithic debitage and tools,
suggesting Paleoindian occupations during
these interspersed periods of landscape
stabilization.
As illustrated in Figure 7-3, the period
roughly between 9817 and 8830 BP (3.0–4.1
meters below the surface) appears to be one
of relatively stable conditions. During this
roughly 1,000-year period, the lower portion of
Stratigraphic Zone 6 and Zones 7 and 8 were
forming. As Frederick points out, these zones
represent a floodplain with structured upward
fining of sediments within the alluvium from
both Barton Creek and the Colorado River.
In addition, he sees increasing trends in both
magnetic susceptibility and organic carbon
Ecological Communications Corporation

within this zone that peak at 3.05 mbs. These
data suggest that the surface was overall
sufficiently stable throughout the 1,000 years
so that at least some degree of soil development
was occurring, with the most stable period
occurring at the 3.05 mbs level, or about 8830
BP. In cooborating apparent land stability,
Tomka (Chapter 9) has identified two cultural
analytical units (AUs 1 and 2) within this late
Paleoindian to Early Archaic period.
The previous discussion demonstrates that
the use of unmodified rock sizes can serve
as coorborating evidence for identifying
excavated levels, and in turn, periods during
which the landscape was either relatively
stable or unstable. Another way to examine the
presumed periods of relative stability versus
periods of high energy rainfall and flooding is
to evaluate the total weight of rocks of all sizes.
Figure 7-4 compares the vertical distribution of
both alluvial and colluvial rock weights from
3.0 to 4.0 mbs. The trends in Figure 7-4 infer
that the period before approximately 8830 BP
(3.0–3.1 mbs) was one of relative stability.
This is the same level that Frederick opines
was a peak period for soil development. Note
also that three of the five cultural features
found during this project were between 292
and 317 cmbs (see Chapter 8). The second
notable period of surface stability occurs

Rock Counts >1 Inch

Depth (mbd)

As discussed in Chapter 4, an analysis of the
quantities, sizes, and types of natural rocks
recovered should serve as a proxy for inferring
relative degrees of erosional and depositional
forces through time. Figure 7-3 illustrates
the vertical distribution of both alluvial and
colluvial rocks greater than one inch in size.
Also shown are the bulk sediment dates
corresponding with each level. Most glaring
is the extremely significant shift in erosional
forces that was occurring around 10,905 BP
(4.9–5.0 mbs). These forces likely represent
the tail end of a pronounced erosional and
downcutting period recognized by Blum
(1992) that occurred between the Eagle Lake
Alloformation depositional sequence and
CBA1 (see Chapter 6).

from 4.0 to 4.9 mbs. A period of relative
stability is inferred by the low weight of rocks
found between 4.0 and 4.1 mbs. Based on the
interpolated conventional 14C date, this period
of relative stability likely occurred around
9817 BP, within the lower range of artifacts
identified by Tomka as AU 2.

The earliest period of apparent relative
stability is shown to occur between 4.8 and
4.9 mbs, ca. 10,820 BP. As discussed above,
this is at the tail end of a pronounced erosional
and downcutting period, and the beginning of
the Columbus Bend Alloformation Member 1
depositional sequence (Blum 1992). Tomka
sees the lithic assemblage from this level as
fitting within AU 3.2.

between 3.2 and 3.4 mbs, between 9498 and
perhaps 9030 BP. A third period of stability
can be seen between 3.6 and 3.7 mbs, or about
9634 BP. Perhaps not surprisingly then, Tomka
(Chapter 9) has identified cultural AU 1 within
the upper 60 cm, from 3.0 to 3.6 mbs.
The extreme quantity of rock recovered from
4.9 to 5.0 mbs skews any attempt to reasonably
compare like data. Therefore, the data from
4.9 to 5.0 mbs have been extracted, and Figure
7-5 illustrates the vertical distribution of rocks

86

An earlier period of relative stability is implied
by the lesser overall weight between 4.4 and
4.5 mbs, i.e., somewhere around 10,480 BP.
Cultural materials found at this level are at the
lower portion of lithic AU 3.1.

As implied, periods of decline in colluviation
and/or alluviation allow cultural material to
accumulate on relatively stable land surfaces,
while periods of increases in deposition can
result in rapid burial of archaeological remains.
Table 7-2 summarizes the periods of surmised
relative landscape stability in the immediate
area of the site based upon the overall weights
of unmodified, natural rocks, as well as high
nodes in chipped stone tools and debitage.
The data presented in this chapter further
corroborate that presented in Chapters 6, 9,
10, and 12, indicating that overall, the site’s
stratigraphy and cultural materials from 3.0
to 4.9 mbs are relatively intact. Therefore,
by validating the integrity of the site and its
components, it can be presumed that any
information further presented throughout can
be construed as reliable.

Features
By David L. Nickels
The five features discovered during this
project are listed in Table 8-1 and described
below. Bulk sediment dates were obtained for
all five. Flotation samples were collected from
in and around all five features and submitted
for analysis, but yielded only minimal
ethnobotanical information (Appendix H).

8.1	Feature 1
Feature 1 was located in Unit 13 at 293–297
cmbs. It was an isolated, sparse scatter of
lithics, mussel shells, and Rabdotus spread
across what appeared to be a compacted,
probable occupation surface 293 cmbs (Figure
8-1). The noticeably more compacted surface
was encountered within the lower portion of
Soil Zone I, described as dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4) silty clay.
Approximately 80 Rabdotus were concentrated
in the southwest corner of the unit along with
four flakes, three mussel shell umbos, one
small (5 cm) limestone burned rock, and a
fragmented uniface tool made from a biface
manufacturing flake (Appendix I). Based upon
the average of both humics and humins, a bulk
sediment sample submitted to Beta Analytic

yielded dates of 7550–7550 cal BP, 7510–7410
cal BP, 7390–7370 cal BP, and 7360–7330 cal
BP (AMS method, 2σ, Beta-260697); however,
as discussed in Chapter 17, an oxygen isotope
interpolated conventional 14C date ages this
feature at 8630 BP. No charcoal or faunal
remains were observed. An approximately
1-L (1.2 kg) flotation sample yielded two tiny
charred wood fragments (< 0.01 g), both of an
indeterminate species.

8.2	Feature 2
Feature 2 was a small, open-air hearth
consisting of nine fire-cracked limestone
pieces uncovered between 292 and 296 cmbs
in Unit 5 (Figures 8-2 and 8-3). It was located
at the same depth as, and approximately 1.5
m south of, Feature 1. Associated cultural
material recovered from the ¼-inch screen
included 3 flakes (see Appendix I) and 50
Rabdotus. No charcoal or faunal remains were
observed. Based upon the average of both
humics and humins, a bulk sediment sample
submitted to Beta Analytic yielded dates of
9890–9480 cal BP (2σ, Beta-260690). This
date range is around 2,000 years older than
those obtained in association with Feature 1

degree of disturbance; but, oxygen isotope
interpolated 14C dates suggest this feature is
likely roughly the same age as Feature 1, ca.
8630 BP.
Three of the rocks were tabular, with the two
largest found lying horizontal, suggesting they
were relatively undisturbed. The four smaller
specimens to the southeast are likely pitchout
pieces, as is the one to the east and the one

in the extreme northwest corner. Following
extraction, none of the pieces could be refitted.
The bottoms of all sloped slightly from the
northwest toward the southeast, suggesting a
gently sloping surface at the time the hearth
was constructed.
Because of their very fragile condition
and thinness, attempts at drilling cores for
archaeomagnetic samples were only minimally
successful. However, demagnetization data
91

Chapter 8

Features

from Sample 91 indicate that Feature 2 was
heated to between 100 and 150°C, and Sample
93 was heated once to 300°C, then again to
150°C. Two heating events were detected in
Sample 95; the first one was at 400°C, and it
was then reused and heated a second time to
100–200°C. The data extracted from Sample
96 indicate it had been heated to 300°C. In
sum, the archaeomagnetic data indicate that
this campfire was used at least three times, and
heated to as high as 400°C (see Chapter 16). An
8.25-L (3.0 kg) flotation sample yielded only
one tiny piece of charred botanical material of
an indeterminate species.

8.3	Feature 3
Feature 3 was an isolated scatter of burned
rock in Unit 13 between 311 and 317 cmbs.
It consisted of three tabular pieces of small
burned limestone rocks situated in a half-moon
shape, extending over a 28 x 30-cm area (Figure

8-4). This ephemeral hearth was situated
within the lower portion of Soil Zone IV, a
dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) blocky silty
clay, about 15–18 cm directly below Feature 1,
and approximately 1.5 m north of and 15 cm
below Feature 2. Bulk sediments from Feature
3 date to 8600–8420 cal BP (2σ, Beta-260698),
or approximately 9030 BP based on oxygen
isotope interpolated 14C dates.
No faunal remains or charcoal were found,
and the only cultural material associated with
Feature 3 recovered from the ¼-inch screen
was a chipped stone flake (see Appendix I).
Approximately 8.5 L (3 kg) of floated sediments
revealed four tiny pieces of charred but
unidentifiable wood species (< 0.01 g). Because
of their very fragile condition and thinness,
attempts at drilling cores for archaeomagnetic
samples were only minimally successful.
The data from Sample 97 (see Chapter 16)
indicate that this burned rock was used

temperature was very hot, 475°C. In its two
successive uses it was heated to 300°C and then
to 100–150°C. Sample 98 was heated twice,
once to 400°C, and a second time to 200°C.
Sample 99 was also heated twice, the first time
to 400°C, and the second time to 150–200°C.

is unknown. Stratigraphically, it is nearly
coeval with Unit 1, 380–390 cmbs, where a
bulk sediment assay yielded a date 11,250–
11,150 cal BP (2σ, Beta-260688). However,
an oxygen isotope interpolated conventional
14
C date suggests that the stain is not that old;
instead, it likely dates to around 9770 BP. The
entire stained area was collected (224 g) and
analyzed as a flotation sample, but no evidence
of charred plant remains were found.

8.5	Feature 5

Feature 4 was a darkened stain roughly 12
cm in diameter and 1 cm thick, found in the
southwest quadrant of Unit 6 at 378–379 cmbs
(Figure 8-5). Although 31 Rabdotus and a
single mussel shell umbo were recovered from
the ¼-inch screen, and a small tabular limestone
piece was found nearby at 380 cmbs, they do
not appear to be associated with the stain.
Notably, it is located at the transition between
Soil Zones I and II, but what caused the stain

Feature 5 was a lithic concentration consisting
of 46 pieces of black chert debitage and one
black chert core in the southwest corner of Unit
1 at 380–390 cmbs (Figure 8-6, see Appendix
I). A limestone cobble was also found in the
southwest corner, but it does not appear to
be culturally associated with the chipped
stone. Stratigraphically, this feature is nearly
equivalent to Feature 4, a darkened stain on
the upper cusp of Soil Zone II. In addition

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts
By Steve A. Tomka, Cynthia M. Munoz, Eric Oksanen, and Raymond P. Mauldin

9.1	Scope of Work
Initial analysis had ascertained that several
analytical units (AUs) may be defined within
the 2 m of deposits based on artifact counts, soil
magnetic susceptibility and wall profiles, and
profile descriptions. Therefore, we proposed
to examine the lithic assemblage to address
four research domains that would focus on
site formation processes and several aspects of
hunter-gatherer behavior. The research domains
that we identified and the specific analysis
approach and attributes chosen for analysis are
summarized below.

9.1.1 Site Formation Processes
The main research question to address under
this research module is whether or not the
site’s deposits, particularly those sitting in
the deepest depositional unit characterized by
gravely deposits, are in situ. We proposed to
analyze several attributes of the lithic debitage
collection to define the processes responsible
for the materials found in the deeper portions
of the deposits.
Relevant attributes associated with lithic
debitage are: ridge rounding, edge nicking,
patination, carbonate deposition, size-sorting,
and microdebitage presence/absence.

9.1.2 Clovis Technology
While radiocarbon dates from the deepest
deposits indicated ages congruent with
Clovis occupation of the site, few temporally
diagnostic artifacts (see Ricklis et al. 1991)
Ecological Communications Corporation

have been recovered that definitively identified
a Clovis occupation. Therefore, a second
principal research goal was to search for and
identify any diagnostic indicator of Clovis
technology in the assemblage.
We proposed to analyze several attributes of
the lithic debitage and tool assemblage from
the site to identify any tool forms and aspects
of the lithic technology that may be linked to
Clovis occupants of the site. Relevant attributes
associated with lithic debitage are: over-shot
flakes, blades and snapped fragments, fluting
flakes, platform preparation flakes, and core
tablet flakes. Relevant attributes associated
with the tool assemblage are: Clovis projectile
points, end and side scrapers made on blades,
graver tips, and polyhedral cores.

9.1.3 Hunter-Gatherer Mobility
Given that the age of the deposits suggested
the presence of Early Archaic and Paleoindian
materials, another of the research interests was
to document, if feasible, patterns of huntergatherer mobility and changes in mobility
strategies over time, particularly during the
Paleoindian-Early Archaic transition.
We proposed to analyze several attributes of
the lithic debitage collection as well as the
tool assemblage recovered from the site to
address aspects of hunter-gatherer mobility.
Based on the work of Parry and Kelly (1987),
we assumed that low core/biface manufacture
ratios would be indicative of high mobility,
while high ratios would be representative of
reduced frequencies and ranges of mobility.

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

not provide a sufficiently large sample for
analysis, the moderate-sized lithic debitage
collection would afford us the opportunity
to differentiate and gauge the rates of core
reduction versus biface manufacture over time.
We also assumed that hunter-gatherers that had
longer annual ranges of mobility would have
access to a greater variety of raw materials than
more localized groups. Therefore, changes in
the range of raw material types by component
should reflect changes in the scale of mobility
over time. Relevant attributes associated with
lithic debitage (indentifying core vs. biface
reduction) are: platform faceting, platform
angle, platform grinding, dorsal flake scar
directionality, longitudinal curvature, cortex,
and cortex location and type. Relevant attributes
reflective of raw material procurement
strategies and mobility are Minimal Analytical
Nodule Analysis and identification of local vs.
non-local raw materials.

9.1.4 Site Use and Function
Given that the lithic artifact collection
represented one of the largest data types from
the site, if it was feasible based on assemblage
composition, we also sought to define site
use and address site function. Under site
use, we were interested in defining the types
of activities that were carried out on-site as
reflected by the lithic technology. Also, by
incorporating information related to mobility
patterns, we wanted to define what may have
been the role of the site within the annual range
of the hunter-gatherers who visited. Relevant
attributes associated with tool assemblage
analysis (formal vs. expedient tools) are:
identifying expedient tools, identifying
minimally retouched tools, identifying formal
tools, and information derived from raw
material procurement as reflected within the
unmodified lithic debitage and tools and as
related to overall mobility strategies.
As the analyses and write-up began, and
given the fact that the lithic assemblage was

96

the principal data type available for study,
we combined the discussion of site use and
function with issues related to hunter-gatherer
mobility. With this exception, we were able to
address all other defined research aspects in
this study.

9.2

Analysis Methods

This section summarizes the attributes selected
and their methods of analysis. The debitage
analysis methodology is summarized first,
followed by the analysis methodology employed
for the small sample of tools recovered from
the site.

9.2.1 Debitage Analysis
Methodology
Each piece of unmodified lithic debitage
was subject to a detailed analysis. Angular
pieces of chert that did not retain identifiable
striking platforms, bulbs of percussion, or
clearly definable dorsal and/or ventral surfaces
were categorized as angular debris. All other
debitage was separated into four categories:
complete flakes (debitage having a striking
platform, hinge or feather termination, and
intact margins), proximal flake fragments
(debitage with a platform but lacking a hinge
or feather termination), medial flake fragments
(debitage that lacked both a platform and a
hinge or feather termination), and distal flakes
(debitage that lacked a striking platform but
had either a hinged or a feathered termination).
During this initial inspection of the collection,
heat spalls and other non cultural items (natural
rocks, fossil shell) were removed and set aside.
Different attributes were recorded on each flake
category as shown in Table 9-1. The length, width,
and thickness of all debitage were recorded
using digital calipers. On complete, proximal,
medial, and distal flakes, length was measured
as the maximum dimension perpendicular
to the striking platform or direction of force.

Width was perpendicular to the
length measurement, and thickness
was measured perpendicular to the
intersection of the width and length
segments. For angular debris, the
maximum length and the thickness
perpendicular to the midpoint of the
maximum length were used.

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

9.3	Definition of
Analytical Units

Magnetic susceptibility is enhanced by ironreducing bacteria that favor a damp settings
(Maher and Thompson 1995). Too much water
and poor drainage can reduce the magnetic
susceptibility of the sediments. We anticipate
that the environment along Barton Creek was
likely suitable for enhancing the magnetic
susceptibility of the deposits.

The lithic assemblage and associated
provenience data, magnetic soil susceptibility
data, and bulk humate radiocarbon assays were
used to create analytical units. The analytical
units are spatial constructs that contain the
artifacts of one or more occupations; finer
seriation into individual occupations is
unlikely because of the excavation techniques
and the likelihood of some artifact movement
in the sediments. The magnetic susceptibility
measurements were made in 2-cm increments
on a cleared east wall profile using a portable
Barington magnetic susceptibility meter. The
resulting kappa values are corrected for volume.

Magnetic susceptibility values are highest in
the A-horizon where iron-bearing minerals
tend to form and accumulate. Through time,
these minerals can leach downwards to the
B-horizon, resulting in decreased susceptibility
values (Crockford and Willett 2001). Low
susceptibility values can occur with the rapid
addition of sediments such as from flood
alluvium and from wind driven loess in other
regions (Liu et al. 2001). A drop in comparative
magnetic susceptibility values suggests the
addition of new sediments, likely alluvial
deposition.

raw material color grouping unless it was so
heavily patinated that its original color could
not be determined.

Peaks in debitage counts and in susceptibility
values can be measures of site use intensity
and/or the accumulation of artifacts and
concentration of magnetic minerals on a
relatively stable surface. Drops in artifact
counts and susceptibility values can result
from a decrease in site use intensity or from
an aggrading environment that diffuses artifact
concentrations and lowers susceptibility values.
Based on TARL’s previous work at the site
(Ricklis et al. 1991) and soil profile descriptions
by Frederick, the project geomorphologist, and
Nickels, the Project Archaelogist, it is evident
that the site setting represents predominantly
an aggrading environment, where traces of
occupations were periodically covered by
alluvium. The high carbonate content of the
unmodified alluvium from Barton Creek would
have a low magnetic susceptibility. Values
would increase from pedogenic processes
that include biogenic and inorganic chemical
transformations from cultural and natural
processes such as burning, cooking fires, and
vegetation growth and decay on a stable surface
(Crowther 2003b; Hanesch and Scholger
2005; Maher et al. 2003; Singer et al. 1996).

In Figure 9-2, the total debitage by depth is
plotted with a dashed red line. The depth is
taken as the midpoint from a level, so that for
instance the 280–290 cmbs level is indicated by
285 cmbs in Figure 9-2. Magnetic susceptibility
values are indicated by the solid black line.
The peak indicates maximum susceptibility
values for a given analytical unit. The peaks
in magnetic soil susceptibility and debitage
counts generally coincide, and are roughly the
midpoint in an analytical unit. However, the
two measures are not exactly correlated, due in
part to the data collection methods.

9.3.1 Analytical Unit 1 (AU 1)
AU 1 is from 300 to 360 cmbs. The amount of
debitage is less than in the deeper analytical units.
The depth of 300 cmbs was selected because
of concern that upper levels were possibly
disturbed because of machine excavations.
Therefore, a 20-cm buffer of hand-excavated
levels was used to minimize the likelihood of
mixing with the upper components. The dip
in susceptibility values at roughly 362 cmbs is

the approximate boundary with the lower
analytical unit (AU 2) and is interpreted as
an increase in sedimentation. The ages of
the deposits at 300–360 cmbs range from
8600–8420 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260698) to
10,760–10,560 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260694).

9.3.2 Analytical Unit 2 (AU 2)
AU 2 is from 360 to 410 cmbs. The
analytical unit best demonstrates an apparent
correlation between artifact counts and
susceptibility peak values as artifact counts
increase. This suggests a period of more
intensive occupation. A single radiocarbon
assay was obtained from deposits between
360 and 410 cmbs; that sample dates to
11,250–11,150 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260688).

9.3.3 Analytical Unit 3 (AU 3)
AU 3 is from 410 to 490 cmbs. The majority
of artifacts are from this analytical unit,
where the susceptibility values are lowest.
Two radiocarbon assays, Beta-260699 at
440–450 cmbs (9950–10,050 cal BP) and
Beta-260701 at 460–470 cmbs (10,940–
11,060 cal BP) suggest a slowly aggrading
environment. The lower susceptibility
values can be attributed to the age of the soil,
since in long-stable soils, magnetic minerals
are leached downward. As soil thickness
increases, pedogenic activity that generates
magnetic minerals decreases in deeper soils.
The magnetic susceptibility profile of the
peak in AU 3 can be interpreted as a longstable surface at approximately 470 cmbs. The
susceptibility values were preserved in part
through repeated alleviation that removed the
soil from further pedogenic effects. The ages of
the deposits between 410 and 490 cmbs range
from 11,320–11,190 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260689)
to 12,830–12,900 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260693).
Another variable that is related both to refining
the analytical units, as well as assessing
their integrity, is debitage size. Size sorting,
commonly indicated by consistent decrease in

mean chipped stone size with increasing depth,
potentially can compromise the analytical unit
distinctions. In this section, then, we focus
on assessing chipped stone size within and
between the three analytical units defined
previously on artifact numbers and magnetic
soil susceptibility values. Throughout this
section, we use “maximum dimension”
measured in mm to consider size differences.
However, note that the true maximum
dimension of an item was only measured on
pieces that could not be oriented (i.e., angular
debris). For other debitage items, we measured
length and width, both of which we determined
relative to the direction of applied force rather
than maximum item size. While it is possible to
approximate the maximum dimension for other
debitage items (i.e., complete flakes, proximal,

medial, and distal fragments) by using the
largest measured value (i.e., length or width),
this measurement will underestimate the true
maximum dimension by a small amount in most
cases. As the angular debris group accounts for
only 5.5 percent of the roughly 1,300 items
analyzed, and as no single analytical unit has
a concentration of these items, the differences
in measuring techniques are unlikely to be the
cause of any size differences.
Figure 9-3 plots the mean maximum size
of debitage by each of the three analytical
units defined previously. Examination of the
mean values shows that there is a decrease
in mean debitage size with increasing depth,
though the differences between AU 1 and AU
2 are minimal. Debitage in AU 3, however,
is significantly smaller than debitage in the
higher analytical units. AU 3 debitage averages
about 6 mm smaller than that in AU 1. Sample
size is the primary influence on the large error
bars for AU 1 and 2 and the small error bars
associated with AU 3. AU 1 has only 69 items
and AU 2 has 129. AU 3, in contrast, has 998
items present.
102

The presence of only a few items in
the upper analytical units spread over a
large area suggests that they may have
limited utility, at least for any detailed
analysis. AU 1, for example, spans 60
cm in thickness across the 16-m2 block.
The recovery of 69 pieces of debitage
from 9.6 m3 yields a density of only
7.19 items per cubic meter. AU 2 has
129 items in 8 m3 of sediment. This is
an overall density of only 16.13 items
per cubic meter. AU 3 has a density of
78 items per cubic meter of sediment,
a ten-fold increase over that in AU 1.
These differences are exacerbated by
the observation that depositional rates
were highest in the lower levels (see
Ricklis et al. 1991:49). Given the low
densities and low rates of accumulation,
we primarily use the debitage in the
upper analytical units to highlight
differences and similarities relative to
AU 3. Note also that while the AU 3
sample size and density is substantially
higher when compared to AUs 1 and 2, the
absolute debitage density within AU 3 is still
only about 8 items per 1 x 1 m by 10-cm level.
Examination of Figure 9-2, however, suggests
that there are increasing numbers of items near
the bottom of this 80-cm thick analytical unit.
Figure 9-4 considers the size distribution
of debitage within AU 3. Overall, there is a
decrease in debitage size. However, in the upper
four levels (410–460 cmbs), mean maximum
debitage size is relatively constant, varying
by roughly 1 mm, with no directional change.
At that point, there is a substantial decrease of
over 2 mm in mean size, and then size decreases
slightly through the bottom of the analytical
unit (see Figure 9-4). We have added size data
from Level 23, 490 to 500 cmbs—the bottom
1
level in the excavation block, toPage
the figure
for
comparison. Clearly, debitage in Level 23 are
significantly larger than those recovered in the
bottom four levels (450–490 cmbs) in AU 3. We
will show, subsequently, that Level 23 has a high
frequency of secondary-deposited material. A

high percentage of the debitage in this
level has been transported. As a result
of the uncertainly of the origin of some
of the materials found in this deepest
level, we will not consider these few
items as part of AU 3. Furthermore,
given these size data, we suggest
that AU 3 should be divided into two
smaller blocks for comparison, and
we will designate these blocks AU 3.1
and 3.2. Two radiocarbon assays have
been obtained from deposits dating
between 490–500 cmbs. They range
in age from 12,390–11,830 cal BP (2σ;
Beta-260700) to 12,740–12,120 cal
BP (2σ; Beta-260696). These ages are
statistically indistinguishable from the
age of the deposits at 460–470 cmbs
in AU 3.2 (13,080–12,750 cal BP [2σ;
Beta-260701] and 12,460–12,900 cal
BP [2σ; Beta-260693]).

AU 3.1 consists of 410–450 cmbs.
The analytical unit has 203 pieces of
debitage, with a relatively low density of 31.7
items per cubic meter of excavated sediment.
AU 3.2 consists of the subsequent four levels
(450–490 cmbs). This analytical unit contains
794 items, for a density of 124 items per cubic
meter of excavated sediment.

9.4	Site Formation
Processes
The excavations carried out at the site by
TARL determined that the depositional zones
containing the cultural materials were sloping
downward from the Cretaceous/Pleistocene
surface at the western end of the site toward the
confluence of the Colorado River and Barton
Creek at the east end of the site (Ricklis et al.
1991:Figure 17). Our inspection of the depths
of the depositional zones defined by the crew
during the investigations indicates that the
zones seem to slope from the southwest to the
northeast. There appears to be a drop of about
20–25 cm across the 4-m block. In addition,

given the locality’s proximity to both streams,
it has also been documented that repeated
flooding of the streams also has contributed
to the formation processes of the deposits.
Zone IV, the deepest (4.8–5.0 mbs) of the
zones identified by the crew, consists primarily
of rounded pebbles and gravels as large as 5
cm in maximum dimension. Zone III above
it (approx. 4.65–4.80 mbs) also contained
rounded pebbles, but these were smaller (less
than 1.0 cm in max dimension) and relatively
common across the center of the block (Units
3, 6, 11 and 14) suggesting a lower-energy
depositional context.
Therefore, it is expected that colluvial and
alluvial processes may have both influenced
the cultural materials found at the site, and
specifically those within the deepest analytical
unit. Ricklis et al. (1991:49) have calculated
that the rate of deposition for the period
between 11,000 and 9000 BP was 0.135 cm per
year, or 2.7 m over 2,000 years. In contrast, the
depositional rate for the last 9,000 years was
only 0.036 cm per year, accounting for 3.3 m

of deposition over the period. The rapid rate
of deposition during the first 2,000 years may
have helped to isolate cultural materials from
individual or short-duration occupations of
the site. But it may also have been responsible
for actually bringing in or moving these same
materials within or across the site.

Edge nicking is prevalent within the lithic
debitage assemblage. Figure 9-5 is a bar
graph of the percentage of edge-nicked lithic
debitage by analytical unit, with overall sample
sizes provided in each bar and the AU 3.1 and
3.2 deposits indicated in black. Just over 42
percent of the 1,306 pieces of debitage exhibits
edge-nicking. The breakdown of edge-nicked
debitage by analytical unit indicates that the
materials from AU 1 have the highest percentage
of edge-nicked specimens (56.5%), while
edge-nicking is present in lower percentage
on flakes from AUs 2, 3.1, 3.2, and Level 23
(490–500 cmbs). Overall, the percentages
are surprisingly consistent (see Figure 9-5).
Although it is possible that the edge-nicking
is derived from movement and redeposition of
debitage, given the high consistency between
analytical units we suggest that nicking is a
function of excavation strategy.

Given the potential that both colluvial and
alluvial processes may have contributed to
site formation, one of the main concerns,
particularly since the deepest analytical
unit was contained within a gravely deposit,
was whether the cultural materials were
deposited directly within this zone through
human activity or colluvial or perhaps
alluvial processes. We pursued three lines of
analysis to answer this question: 1) presence/
absence of post-depositional alterations (i.e.,
dorsal ridge rounding, edge nicking) to the
cultural materials found in the analytical
unit; 2) evidence of size sorting among the
unmodified lithic debitage, the most abundant
artifact category recovered from the site;
and 3) distribution of patinated and calciumcarbonate–covered materials (debitage and
other lithic artifacts) within the deposits.

We assumed that dorsal scar rounding
would be expected on artifacts that
have been transported long distance
under highly dynamic conditions such
as flooding. Edge nicking without
rounding of scar ridges would potentially
represent the impacts of more localized,
short-distance depositional forces (e.g.,
colluvial processes) or perhaps artifact
recovery methods. On the other hand, we
assumed that the occurrence of patinated
artifacts may be a signal of the presence
of stable surfaces that allowed artifacts to
remain exposed for long periods of time
prior to burial. Finally, we anticipated
that the deposition of calcium carbonate
layers on artifacts may be more likely
when they are buried for sufficiently long
time to allow the leaching and subsequent
redeposition of CaCo2.

Figure 9-7 presents the percentage of
patinated debitage by analysis unit. It is
evident that AU 1, and material above that
analytical unit, has the highest percentages
(34–38%) of patinated debitage. Patination
decreases with increasing depth to the
point that only 6.9 percent of the debitage
from AU 3.1 is patinated. AU 3.2 has a
slightly higher percentage (11.7%), and
there is a handful (10.3%) of patinated
artifacts from Level 23 (490–500 cmbs).
This figure is roughly similar to AU 3.2.
In combination with the predominance
of patinated artifacts recovered during
the screening of materials removed by
backhoe from the 2.0–3.0-m depth (above
AU 1; see Figure 9-7), it suggests that a
stable surface was present somewhere
within this 1-m-thick deposit that allowed
the patination of artifacts. The magnetic
soil susceptibility data show a series of
peaks in values between 240 and 280
cmbs, suggesting that the stable surface
may have been located somewhere within
this depth.

The distribution of mean maximum debitage
size, discussed in greater detail in relation to the
definition of analysis units, also has implications
related to the site formation processes. Figure

for deposits above AU 1 down through the
AU 3.2 deposits (Figure 9-6). However, as
is clearly shown in Figure 9-6, the bottom
level of the excavation (Level 23; 490–
500 cmbs) has a significant increase, with
over 41 percent of the material recovered
having extensive polishing and edgerounding. It is likely that much of this
material has been transported, probably in
gravel deposits.

The patterns in this figure were used to argue
that AU 3 can be subdivided into two subunits
based on dramatic and consistent differences
in mean maximum debitage size between 410–
450 cmbs and 450–490 cmbs. Just as important
is the observation that the debitage from Level
23 is significantly larger than that from AU 3.2.

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

The larger mean maximum size of the debitage
in Level 23 in conjunction with the pattern noted
in Figure 9-6 suggests that different formation
processes are responsible for the materials
found in the deepest excavation levels from the
site. Frederick’s geomorphic descriptions of
the east wall of the block (based on a narrow
exposure between the support walls), indicates
that Zone 11 (491–524 cmbs) contains fine
gravels of rounded limestone. Based on Nickels’
field observations of soil characteristics and
excavation unit wall profiles, the deepest
depositional zone, Zone IV, contains rounded
limestone gravels that measure less than 5 cm
in maximum dimension. This indicates that
the Zone IV deposits may have been created
by higher-energy flooding than the deposits of
AUs 1–3. Such higher-energy flooding could
have been responsible for the transport of larger
cultural materials.

9.5	Clovis Technological
Diagnostics and
Artifacts of Possible
Clovis Affiliation
Given that the deepest analytical unit
corresponds in age to the early portion of
the Paleoindian period known as Clovis
(11,300–10,900 BP; Collins 1999), one goal
of the lithic analysis was to determine what if
any cultural material could be affiliated with
a Clovis occupation of the site. Following
the preliminary assessment of the collection
received at the Center for Archaeological
Research, it was proposed that two data sets
would be investigated to identify such potential
affinities with a Clovis technology: chipped
lithic tools and unmodified lithic debitage.
Chipped lithic tools are discussed first. In the
following paragraphs we discuss the general
characteristics of Clovis tool and debitage
assemblages that may serve as diagnostics
of Clovis lithic technology. We follow this
presentation with the discussion of the artifacts
recovered from the site that may be associated
with or diagnostic of Clovis technology.
106

9.5.1 Chipped Lithic Tools,
Cores, and Debitage
Expected in Clovis
Assemblages
Although the projectile point is the most
recognized artifact of the period, Clovis
assemblages also contain a variety of other
tools (Goebel et al. 1991; Huckell 2007). They
include end scrapers with graver tips (spurred
end scrapers) made on blades, side scrapers
made on blades, and minimally retouched
gravers. In addition, prismatic blades are
often found with marginally retouched edges
indicative of use as knives or scrapers (Kay
1999:126–143).
Clovis projectile points are often fluted on one
or both faces, and while most often there is only
one flute per face, multiple fluted specimens
also exist (Morrow 1995). Clovis bifaces that
have not received the final finishing/shaping
flaking have well-aligned edges, broad flake
removals that often extend across the entire
face of the biface, and range from 14 to 17
mm in maximum thickness and 60 to 75
mm in maximum width (Frison and Bradley
1999:Table 1). Some of these bifaces will have
one or more base thinning flake removals or
flutes on one or both faces (Frison and Bradley
1999:Plate 25–28; 30–32), while in other cases
basal thinning has not occurred yet (Frison and
Bradley 1999:Plate 34–41, 50–52).

9.5.2 Clovis Technological
Diagnostics
With the exception of Clovis points, perhaps
the second-most typical chipped lithic
artifacts commonly associated with Clovis
occupations are the conical and wedge-shaped
blade cores (Collins 1999; Collins and Lohse
2004). None of these typical artifacts were
recovered during the excavation of the Vara
Daniel Site. Therefore, although the deepest
levels of the site were sufficiently old to fall
within the early portion of the Paleoindian, no
temporally diagnostic tool forms were present
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

in the archaeological collection. Lacking the
aforementioned diagnostic artifacts, it was
decided that we would examine the artifact
collection for other technological diagnostic
items linked to Clovis lithic technology.
While outrapassé or overshot flakes and bifaces
bearing the scars of overshot flake removal
scars are present in lithic assemblages of all
ages, the lithic technology of no other period
reflects the consistent and systematic use of
controlled overshot removals as a reduction
strategy (Bradley 1982; Frison and Bradley
1999). Given the relative rarity of overshot
flakes and flake scars on Late Prehistoric and
Archaic artifacts, it may be assumed that such
removals were mistakes rather than intentional
elements of the reduction strategy. In contrast,
the quantity and multiple occurrence of overshot
flake scars on many bifacial artifacts of Clovis
age suggests that the knappers had great control
of the flake removal process and intentionally
used the strategy to both thin and narrow bifacial
artifacts through a single flake removal. The
fact that such removals are consistently present
on Clovis-age bifaces indicates that they may
be used as a technological diagnostic trait.
The typical Clovis channel flake that results
from removing a single fluting flake runs to
roughly one-third of the length of the blank and
retains on its dorsal face flake scars converging
toward the middle of the flake. These flake
scars will be perpendicular to the long axis
of the channel flake. The striking platform
for the flake will be well isolated and ground,
while the distal termination may end in a hinge
fracture scar or feathering. In some instances,
the channel flakes will be so thin that they will
actually break into multiple fragments either
during removal or post-depositionally. While
relatively less frequent than single-fluted
Clovis points, multiple-fluted specimens also
exist (Morrow 1995). In this case, one margin
of the channel flake will bear the scar of the
first channel flake, while the opposite margin
will contain flake removal scars derived from
the lateral margin of the projectile point (Frison
and Bradley 1999:Plate 5).
Ecological Communications Corporation

When channel flake removals fail, they will
produce distal and proximal biface fragments
that will exhibit the typical breakage resulting
from a plunging basal thinning flake (Collins
1999:Figure 3.3d). The proximal fragment will
exhibit the channel flake scar that resulted in
the failure and the distal fragment will show
the negative brake scar. The break plane will
be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
the biface and the scar will begin at the base
of the biface and continue up the biface and
roll through the biface body, emerging on
the opposite face from the channel flake scar.
Such failures will occur in any context when
the basal thinning is improperly executed and
therefore, it is not exclusively a Clovis lithic
technological trait. However, in combination
with morphological characteristics of Clovis
performs (Collins 1999:Figure 3.3; Morrow
1995:Figure 2; Ricklis et al. 1991:Figure
13; Wilke et al. 1991:Figures 6–9), they may
serve as technological diagnostics of Clovis
affiliation.
The manufacture of prismatic blades from
conical and wedge-shaped cores has been
extensively documented in the literature on
Clovis lithic technology (Collins 1999; Malouf
1994). Both the distinctive morphology of the
cores and the characteristics of the blades are
criteria that associate these artifacts with Clovis
technology. Conical cores usually begin with
ovate nodules of chert that are “decapitated”
to create a flat platform surface near one end.
If necessary for initial blade removal, a later
ridge is flaked along the margin of the core
to create a straight-aligned margin that will
aid in the removal of straight blades. The first
blade moved from this margin will therefore be
“crested” while subsequent blades will bear the
scars of blade removals (Collins 1999:Figure
2.7). Conical cores will have blade removal
scars around their entire perimeter and may
have blade removal scars originating from both
ends of the core (Birmingham and Bluhm 2003;
Chandler 1992; Kelly 1992). Wedge-shaped
cores tend to be narrower and will have blade
removal scars only along one face of the core
(Collins 1999:Figure 3.13).
107

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

While it is possible that the blades are removed
through indirect and direct percussion, they
tend to have small well isolated, multifaceted
and ground platforms, tend to be narrower at
the proximal end but widen shortly thereafter,
and have relatively parallel margins. Short
core preparation flake scars may be present
immediately behind the platforms (e.g., on the
dorsal face of the flake) and they are indicative
of the removal of the concave surface generated
along the core perimeter by the previous blade
removals. Moderate to strong longitudinal
curvature is common to most blades.
One unique aspect of blade core preparation
that can be considered a diagnostic lithic
technology of Clovis is the tendency of Clovis
knappers to prepare the surface of the core
platform through the removal of typically
short flakes from around the circumference of
the core and into the body of the core. These
flakes tend to have platforms with one or two
platform facets, have platform to dorsal face
angles approaching or slightly even surpassing
90 degrees, and will often terminate in hinged
distal ends. In addition, they will tend to bear
flake scars that originate from slightly different
angles and converge toward the middle of the
dorsal face. At times, the area immediately
behind (dorsal to) the platform will retain
step fracture scars and the flakes will have a
“winged” appearance where the center of the
flake will be thick as a result of the pronounced
bulb of percussion, but the margins of the
flake will feather out as the flake spreads in
a semicircular or fan shape (Collins et al.
2003:Figure 7-31). Numerous polyhedral cores
show the negative flake scars of such platform
preparation removals (Birmingham and
Bluhm 2003:Figure 1; Chandler 1992:Figure
1; Collins 1999:Figures 3.6 and 3.7; Kelly
1992:Figure 1a–b, Figure 2a–b). Often, the fact
that these platform preparation flakes terminate
in hinges near the margins of the core results in
the build-up of a hump in the center of the core
platform (Collins 1999:3.6a–b).
Build-up on core platform surfaces is likely
to be undesirable, and at least some of core
108

tablet rejuvenation flakes represent the removal
of such humps. However, not all tablet flakes
contain such humps on their dorsal surfaces.
Core tablet flakes are removals that are used
to create a new flat core platform surface. The
correctly executed tablet flakes are removed by
using one blade core scar along the perimeter
of the core as the platform and removing a
flake that slices off the entire previous platform
surface. The margins of the tablet flake will
retain a polyhedral appearance around the
entire circumference of the flake, and the dorsal
face will exhibit the scars of previous hinged
platform preparation flake removals (Collins
1999:3.7d). Some tablet flakes will not slice
through the entire core and will retain core
removal scar facets only along their lateral
margins, while their distal end may be hinged
or feathered (Collins et al. 2003:Figure 7-63).
Collins and Lohse have recently reported the
recovery of microblades associated with the
Clovis component at the Gault Site (2004:178–
181). No small blade cores have been recovered
from the site. However, microblade cores have
been recovered from Component II at the Dry
Creek site in Alaska. This component was dated
to 10,690 ±  25 BP (Goebel et al. 1991:53).
They were also reported at the Krajacic site,
a site contemporaneous with Meadowcroft
Rockshelter in the Cross Creek drainage of
Pennsylvania (Adavasio et al. 1988:Figure 3).
The small blades from the Gault Site range
from 26.5 to 50.5 mm (mean of 39.6 mm)
in length, 7.6 to 16.6 mm in width, and 2.6
to 6.6 mm in thickness. They are straight in
longitudinal cross section, are decorticate, and
have small prepared platforms and diffused
bulbs of percussion.
In summary, the following tool forms may be
representative of Clovis association: Clovis
projectile points, biface fragments bearing
failed channel flake scar removals, spurred
end scrapers on blades, and graver tips. The
following lithic debitage and core forms may
be diagnostic of Clovis lithic technology:
polyhedral cores, polyhedral blades, channel
and base thinning flakes, overshot flakes,

9.5.3 Possible Clovis Materials
Recovered From
Vara Daniel: Tools
Having summarized these technologically
diagnostic features of Clovis lithic technology,
what evidence does the lithic assemblage from
the Vara Daniel Site contain of possible Clovis
affiliation? No Clovis projectile points were

recovered during the EComm excavations at the
site, although the TARL excavations recovered
one biface that was identified as a Clovis point
perform. However, a number of other artifacts
recovered from the EComm excavations fit the
general characteristics of tool forms found in
association with Clovis assemblages (Figure
9-8). Of these, four gravers and two fragmentary
end scrapers have been identified.
The first graver is a tool fragment made on finegrained chert (Figure 9-8a). At least three and
perhaps four graver tips were present on this

Figure 9-8. Gravers (a–c) and end scrapers (d–e) with possible Clovis technological affiliation.

tool fragment. Each graver tip was executed
by the removal of a single relatively large
flake spaced roughly at 7-mm increments from
each other along the edge. Smaller retouch
occurred within the concavities created by
the initial removals to form graving tips. Usederived microflaking is present on each of the
three remaining graver tips. The specimen was
recovered at 290–300 cmbs in Unit 13, above
AU 1.
The second of the gravers was made along the
lateral edge of a distal flake fragment (Figure
9-8b). Concave retouch on either side of the
graver tip created the pointed working edge.
Interestingly, the flake retains cortex along
the working edge. The cortex is somewhat
weathered but appears to have been sufficiently
strong to assume that the working edge would
not collapse during use. A single use-derived
microflake scar removed the tip of the graver.
The specimen was recovered at 440–450 cmbs
in Unit 14 and is part of AU 3.1.
The third graver is a large, secondary, hardhammer flake that has a fortuitously formed
sharp tip (Figure 9-8c). The graving tip has
four microflake scars on it and is missing its
very tip. While two flakes were removed from
the ventral face of the parent flake, they did not
contribute to the shaping of the graving tip. The
specimen was recovered at 480–490 cmbs in
Unit 11, AU 3.2.
The fourth and final graver tip (not shown)
is on the edge of a small flake that itself may
have been removed to rejuvenate the edge
of the tool. Steep unifacial retouch on both
sides of the tip indicate that the working edge
was minimally retouched to create the graver
tip. Given its small size, it is not illustrated
here. A single microflake scar appears to have
been removed during use of the tool. It was
recovered at 450–460 cmbs in Unit 8 and is
part of AU 3.2.
The smaller of the end scrapers is a blade distal
fragment that retains similar retouch and use
wear as noted on the previous artifact (Figure
110

9-8d). It is too small to identity whether it
represents a blade or flake fragment but it is
sufficiently large to identify that the utilized
edge is on the distal end of the flake/blade. It
was recovered at 450–460 cmbs in Unit 9 and
is part of AU 3.2.
The larger of the end scraper fragments is
made on a blade (Figure 9-8e). The distal
blade fragment retains three dorsal blade
scars and has a slight longitudinal curvature.
The retouch of the distal end of the blade has
created a relatively straight working edge that
encompasses 10.0 mm of the 13.0-mm width of
the blade. Small (1.0–1.25 mm) use scars are
present on top of the larger retouch scars. The
blade fragment measures 27.4 mm in length,
15.6 mm in maximum width, and 4.4 mm thick
at its maximum. It was recovered at 490–500
cmbs in Unit 10 and comes from below AU 3.2.

9.5.4 Possible Clovis Materials
Recovered From Vara
Daniel: Lithic Debitage
The absence of artifacts that are unmistakable
diagnostics of Clovis lithic technology (i.e.,
points, polyhedral cores, blades) did cause us
to look more intensively for the presence of
other technological diagnostics, such as those
related to debitage that may have resulted
from Clovis blade core maintenance or blade
manufacture. It is within the unmodified
debitage that we have identified some materials
that may link the component to the Clovis lithic
technological tradition.
Three blade fragments and a possible crested
flake are identified in the lithic debitage. The
first of these items is a proximal blade fragment
with a single-faceted striking platform and
three previous blade-removal scars on its
dorsal face (Figure 9-9a). It is parallel sided
and exhibits a bending break morphology at
its distal end. It measures 22.2 mm in length,
has a 9.2-mm-wide platform, and is 16.9 mm
wide at the break. Its trapezoidal cross section
at the break is 3.4 mm thick. Step-fracture

scars are present immediately behind the
platform on the dorsal face. This artifact came
from the 380–390 cmbs level in Unit 15 and is
part of AU 2. The platform-dorsal face angle
measures 75 degrees.
An additional parallel-sided proximal blade
fragment hasbeen identified in the assemblage.
This specimen has a single-faceted striking
platform with some step fracturing immediately
Ecological Communications Corporation

behind the platform (Figure 9-9b). However,
the platform edge is not ground. The blade has a
plano-convex cross section and has no previous
blade-removal scars on its dorsal surface. The
platform-dorsal face angle is 62 degrees. The
specimen measures 19.1 mm in length, has a
6.5-mm-wide platform, and is 16.1 mm wide
and 2.9 mm thick at the break. The specimen
was recovered from wall fall derived from

111

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

470–500 mbs in Unit 10, and is likely part of
AU 3.2.
The third proximal blade fragment (Figure
9-9c) has a prismatic cross section and a
platform with two previous flake removal
scars. The platform edge is heavily ground. The
fragment is 20.3 mm long and the platform is
10.0 mm wide, while the blade is 19.2 mm wide
at the break. It is 4.2 mm thick at the break and
has a bending break morphology. The bulb of
percussion is diffuse, and the ventral face of
the blade has smooth ripples. The platform and
dorsal face angle is 71 degrees. The artifact
comes from 460 to 470 cmbs in Unit 10 and is
part of AU 3.2.
Finally, a fourth artifact (Figure 9-9d) that
may be representative of blade manufacture
came from 430 to 440 cmbs in Unit 8 (AU
3.1). The proximal flake fragment has a strong
multifaceted platform and two diverging ridges
on the dorsal face. Three short flakes were
removed from one of the ridges in an attempt
to bring the ridge into a straighter alignment.
It is possible that the artifact represents the

initial stages of core preparation or may simply
represent an attempt to create an aligned ridge
on a flake removal that has nothing to do with
blade core preparation. The platform and dorsal
face describe a 76-degree angle.
Of the four artifacts discussed in some detail
above, only the first blade fragment comes
closest to serving as a definitive technological
diagnostic of Clovis occupation. This does
not mean that the materials that derive from
the analysis unit identified as Clovis in age do
not represent or are not affiliated with Clovis
lithic technology. After all, the previous TARL
excavations did recover a Clovis perform
from 210 cmbs in Trench 2. At the same time,
however, it does not mean that all artifacts from
AU 3 are dated to the Clovis period or that all
tool forms that are congruent with expectations
related to Clovis tool assemblage composition
are necessarily Clovis in affiliation.
Four microblades also have been identified in
the collection (Figure 9-10). The first specimen
has a single-faceted platform and a prismatic
cross section formed by a single ridge on the

Figure 9-10. Microblades with possible Clovis affiliation.

112

City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

dorsal face (Figure 9-10a). It measures 28.5
mm in length and 15.2 mm in width, and is
9.8 mm thick at its center. It was recovered at
400–410 cmbs in Unit 12. The platform-dorsal
face angle is 71 degrees. It was assigned to AU
2 and the provenience is at the very bottom of
the analytical unit.
The second microblade has three blade scars on
its dorsal face and a trapezoidal cross section
(Figure 9-10b). It measures 38 mm in length
and 8.7 mm in width, and is 4.8 mm thick at
its center. It was recovered at 440–450 cmbs
in Unit 4 and is from AU 3.1. It has a singlefaceted platform and the platform-dorsal face
angle is 75 degrees. It is likely a burin flake
removed in the process of refurbishing a graver
tool.
The third microblade (Figure 9-10c) has two
blade scars on its dorsal face, has a trapezoidal
cross section, and has cortex at its distal end.
It measures 24.5 mm in length, 8.0 mm in
width, and is 3.9 mm thick at its center. It was
recovered at 440–450 cmbs in Unit 2 and is
from AU 3.1. It has two small facets on its
platform and the platform-dorsal face angle
is 83 degrees.

Twenty-two large core platform preparation
flakes have been identified in the collection
(Figure 9-12). They have single-faceted
platforms, a semi-circular shape, and hinged
terminations. Of these 22 platform preparation
flakes, 32 percent (n = 7) come from AU 2
and above, and 68 percent are from AU 3
(AU 3.1 = 3; AU 3.2 = 10; and Level 23 = 2).
Furthermore, a peak in the frequency of
platform preparation flakes is notable in AU
3.2. Ten of the 22 (45%) Clovis platform
preparation flakes are from AU 3.2. However,
the peak in these platform preparation flakes
may be the product of samples size, as 68
percent of the debitage comes from AU 3 and
Level 23 combined, and 61 percent of the
flakes come from AU 3.2. The fact that the
frequency of such flakes seems to be driven by
overall sample sizes of debitage by analytical
unit does not necessarily suggest that the
debitage is not a technological characteristic
of Clovis technology.

The fourth and final microblade (not shown)
has three blade scars on its dorsal face and
a prismatic cross section. It measures 21.3
mm in length and 10.1 mm in width, and is
2.8 mm thick at its center. It was recovered
at 460–470 cmbs in Unit 13 and is from AU
3.2. It has a single-faceted platform and the
platform-dorsal face angle is 71 degrees.
A single overshot flake was identified in the
collection (Figure 9-11). The specimen does
not retain its proximal end and is only the
distal flake fragment. However, the larger
of the flake scars on its dorsal face also
represents yet another overshot removal.
It was recovered from at 350–360 cmbs in
Unit 3 and appears to derive from AU 1. The
material is of very high-quality chert.

9.6	Other Artifacts
Recovered
Fifty-three non-debitage chipped lithic artifacts
were recovered from the Vara Daniel Site (Table
9-3). In addition, 1,312 pieces of unmodified
lithic debitage have been recovered from the site
during hand excavations. They are discussed on
greater detail under the section of the chapter
dealing with hunter-gatherer mobility and site
use. Below, our discussion focuses on the lithic
tool assemblage, and we begin their description
with the artifacts recovered from the backhoeremoved matrix screened by the public.

9.6.1 Artifacts from Screened
Overburden
Ten non-debitage artifacts were recovered
during the public screening of mechanically
excavated overburden from 2–3 mbs
(Appendix J). They consist of four projectile
points, two bifacial gouges, fragments of two
bifacially flaked artifacts (a drill and probable
dart point distal fragment), and two expedient
scrapers. Two of the four projectile points are

complete, while the other two specimens are
proximal fragments (Figure 9-13). The first of
the complete points (Figure 9-13a) has a long,
narrow blade, slight shoulders, and a narrow,
parallel-sided stem with a slightly convex base.
The bottom half of the stem edges are lightly
ground. The blade has a length of 41.9 mm
and a maximum width of 20.0 mm, and is 8.3
mm thick. The stem is 15.9 mm long and 11.3
mm wide at the neck and base. The blade has
been reworked, creating a slightly beveled
appearance, although the point is uniformly
patinated. Small patches of calcium carbonate
are present on one face of the artifact. The
blade morphology is reminiscent of a Hoxie,
and the stem edges adjacent the base retains
moderate grinding. It is also similar to Beveled
Narrow Stem points recovered from WilsonLeonard from Middle or Late Archaic contexts
(Dial et al. 1998:401–402). While the stems of
the Wilson-Leonard specimens are longer, the
blades have the rounded look of the specimen

grinding is evident on the stem edges and
base. The blade has a length of 31.6 mm and
a maximum width of 23.9 mm at the shoulder,
and is 8.9 mm thick. The stem is 14.2 mm long,
13.3 mm wide at the neck and 15.8 mm wide
at the base. The specimen is heavily patinated
on one face and only lightly patinated on the
other. The thick blade, expanding stem, ground
stem and base edges are reminiscent of Wilson
points (i.e., Dial et al. 1998:376-382) but based
116

on overall appearance, Collins (who reviewed
the diagnostic projectile points) suggested that
the point is not a Wilson specimen.
The first of the two proximal fragments (Figure
9-13c) has an impact-fractured blade, a short,
lightly expanding stem, and a wide, deep basal
notch that resulted in thin and pointed basal
corners. The blade is lightly shouldered and
the stem edges are lightly ground. The blade

has maximum width of 26.1 mm and is 6.8
mm thick. The stem is 16.7 mm long, 14.3 mm
wide at the neck, and 14.6 mm wide at the base.
The basal notch is 3.1 mm deep. The point fits
well with the Gower/Uvalde type recovered
from Wilson-Leonard and one of the Uvalde
points recovered from Vara Daniel by TARL
(Ricklis et al. 1991:Figure 12c). The point
retains only patches of light blue patina and it is
the least patinated of the non-debitage artifacts
recovered during hand excavations.
The second proximal fragment (Figure 9-13d)
has a long, slightly contracting stem, concave
base, slight shoulders, and an impact fracture
scar on one face, although the current break
may be the result of blade reworking rather
than impact fracture. The long, rather thick
stem is reminiscent of Andice point forms,
although it does not have the small, later flake
scars present on Andice points resulting from
Ecological Communications Corporation

the basal notching of the type (see Webber
1986). According to Collins, the specimen is
not an Andice type. The existing blade is 25.1
mm wide and 9.5 mm thick. The stem measures
27.8 mm in length, 18.5 mm at the neck, and
15.3 mm at the base. The basal notch is only 1.1
mm deep. Both faces of the point are heavily
patinated.
Two smaller, bifacially flaked artifacts also
came out of the matrix screened by the
public. Both appear to be distal fragments
(Figure 9-14a and b). The smaller of the two
pieces (Figure 9-14a) is the distal fragment
of a drill. It appears to have been broken
post-depositionally, as the break face is not
patinated, while the rest of the artifact is
heavily patinated. The second distal biface
fragment (Figure 9-14b) is alternately beveled
and appears to be a projectile point fragment.
One corner of the break face was used as a
117

Chapter 9

graver tip and subsequently burinated. At least
two short burin scars are present on this corner
of the broken biface fragment. It is a heavily
patinated specimen.
The last two bifaces recovered during the
public screening are distally beveled gouges
that fit the morphology of Brushy Creek
bifaces identified at the Wilson-Leonard site
(Dial 1998:Figure 15-15). The shorter of the
two gouges (Figure 9-14c) measures 80 mm
in length, 38.4 mm in maximum width, and
18.8 mm in maximum thickness. The tool
has a slightly convex beveled working edge
that has an angle of 58 degrees, has curved
sides, and has an almost pointed proximal
end. Use-derived micro- and macroflake scars
are present on the dorsal face of the working
edge, and moderate polish and flake-scar
edge rounding is evident on the dorsal face of
the proximal end. Small patches of calcium
carbonate crust are present on the artifact. The
larger of the complete gouges (Figure 9-14d)
measures 109.3 mm in length, 43.4 mm in
maximum width, and 25.3 mm in maximum
thickness. The tool has a slightly convex
beveled working edge that has an angle of 54
degrees, has curved sides, and has a rounded
proximal end. Macroflake scars are present on
the dorsal face of the working edge, and large
patches of calcium carbonate crust cover much
of the ventral face. It is heavily patinated on
both faces.
The two expedient scrapers represent the use
of a secondary flake and an angular piece of
debris in the performance of scraping tasks. No
modification other than that derived from use is
present on the respective working edges.

9.6.2 Artifacts from HandExcavated Units
The artifact collection derived from the
hand-excavated units consists of 43 nondebitage items. They include 14 scrapers, nine
miscellaneous unifaces, 10 miscellaneous
bifaces, three projectile point fragments
118

(two of which refit), four gravers, a reamer,
a multifunctional expedient tool (knife and
scraper), and a cobble tool. The four gravers
and the two minimally retouched end scrapers
made on blades that may be diagnostic of Clovis
technology have been described in some detail
in the previous section of this chapter.

Projectile Points
A medial and proximal lanceolate dart point
fragment was recovered at 330–340 cmbs in
Unit 6 (Figure 9-15a). It is assigned to AU 1.
The specimen was broken during excavation
and appears to have been a proximal fragment
when it was discarded. The specimen exhibits
collateral ribbon flaking along its length. The
well-ground stem narrows toward the base,
where it expends slightly near the corner of the
base. The base is gently concave and has been
ground. Following the breakage of the blade,
the point appears to have been used as a graver.
Both corners formed by the blade edges and the
break face have been used and subsequently
resharpened using one to two burin removals.
One of these burin flakes was slightly off
center and removed not only the bifacial edge,
but also much of one face of the point. The
fragment is 53 mm long with a maximum blade
width of 19.6 mm and a maximum thickness
of 6.1 mm. Edge grinding is present only on
the bottom 11 mm of the stem. The specimen
has the dimensions and morphological and
technological characteristics of St. Mary’s Hall
points from the site with the same name in
Bexar County and also St. Mary’s Hall points
found at the Wilson-Leonard site (Dial et al.
1998:324–329). It is made of fine-grained, light
gray chert. Collins agrees with the typological
assignment of the specimen.
The second and last specimen recovered
during hand excavations came from 450 to
460 cmbs in Unit 16 (Figure 9-15b) and is
assigned to AU 3.2. It is a stem fragment that
was broken in use. It has a contracting shape
and straight base and the stem edges and base
are very lightly ground. The distal portion of
the fragment appears to show indications of

alternate beveling that likely continued up the
blade. The stem is 17.8 mm wide at the base
and widens to 23 mm at the break, where it is
6.6 mm thick. Although no blade portion has
survived, the rapidly widening stem fragment
is reminiscent of Thrall points encountered at
the Wilson-Leonard site (Dial et al. 1998:322–
324). It is made of black chert that is most
common in AU 3.1 and AU 3.2.

Minimally Retouched Reamer
A single artifact from 390 to 400 cmbs in Unit
6 has been identified as a minimally retouched
reamer (Figure 9-16a). It is assigned to AU 2.
The working edge is made on the corner of
a large, secondary hard-hammer flake. While
it also could have been used as a graver, the
presence of use-derived microflake scars on
the ventral face of the corner combined with
rounding of the tip suggests that its last use
was a reamer. The specimen has patches of
calcium carbonate deposits on one face and is
lightly patinated.
Ecological Communications Corporation

Multifunctional Expedient
Tool (Knife/Scraper)
A single blade-like secondary flake (i.e.,
fits metric definition of blade but missing
technological diagnostics) has been used both
as an expedient knife and an expedient scraper
(Figure 9-16b). Its long and straight edge has a
scalloped appearance consistent with use wear
created by cutting and/or witling. The more
concave edge has microflaking on the dorsal
face of the edge consistent with the use of the
specimen in the performance of scraping tasks.
The tool was recovered from 490 to 500 cmbs
in Unit 10. It came from the level underlying
AU 3.2.

Cobble Tool
A single cobble tool that was used either in the
performance of chopping tasks or as a wedge
was recovered from 470 to 480 cmbs in Unit
3 (not shown). It is assigned to AU 3.2. It is
a cortex-backed nodule with evidence of light

battering on the corticated end and a bifacially
flaked, semicircular working end. Heavy stepfracturing over an area extending for 28 mm
along the bifacial edge is consistent with use
wear derived from chopping tasks. The tool
measures 89.2 mm in maximum length, 72.7
mm in maximum width, and 29.4 in thickness.
It weighs 208.4 g and large portions of both
faces are covered with calcium carbonate.

120

Minimally Retouched Scrapers
Six minimally retouched scrapers are present
in the collection. Of these, two specimens
made on blade fragments have been discussed
earlier. The first of the remaining four scrapers
is made on a complete blade-like flake, and
the retouched working edge is on the ventral
face of the flake blank (Figure 9-16c). The
retouch extends for 36.7 mm along the edge
and the average angle of the working edge is

City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

64 degrees. The specimen came from 400 to
410 cmbs in Unit 4 and is assigned to AU 2.
A second scraper (Figure 9-16d) with minimal
retouch on the ventral face of the flake bank
was recovered from 440 to 450 cmbs in Unit
15, AU 3.1. The retouch extends for 29.4 mm
along the edge and describes an average of 71
degrees. The parent flake is a tertiary proximal
flake fragment. As in the case of the previous
specimen, the retouch begins near the platform
of the parent flake and extends toward the
distal end. Finally, two smaller flake fragments
have unifacial retouch and microflaking
characteristic of scraper use. They come from
480 to 490 cmbs in Unit 5 (AU 3.2) and 480
to 490 cmbs in Unit 12 (AU 3.2). The retouch
describes working edge angles measuring 71
and 85 degrees, respectively. The retouch flake
scars range from 1.84 to 2.0 mm in length.

Expedient Scrapers
Eight tools recovered from hand excavations
at the site are expedient scrapers. Two of them
are complete flakes and the other six are flake
fragments. Of the eight specimens, six are
tertiary flakes and two are secondary flakes.
Five of the specimens are from AU 3.2, two are
from AU 3.1, and the final item is from AU 1.

Miscellaneous Bifaces
Ten bifacially flaked artifacts are classified as
miscellaneous bifaces (Figure 9-17a–d). They
appear to have been broken in manufacture
and, with one exception, their examination did
not reveal any traces of use wear that would
have allowed us to classify them into functional
categories. Six of the ten specimens are
proximal fragments, two are distal fragments
and the final two are edge fragments. Eight of
the ten specimens come from AU 3.2 and two
are from AU 2.
Two of the ten are early reduction-stage
specimens made on secondary flake blanks.
Three are middle reduction-stage fragments,

Ecological Communications Corporation

and three are late reduction-stage specimens.
The two edge fragments cannot be classified
into reduction stages due to their small size.
Two of the ten specimens (Figure 9-17c and
d), both proximal fragments, are discussed in
greater detail. The first specimen (Figure 9-17c)
is a late reduction-stage proximal fragment also
broken longitudinally. The specimen is very
thin (5.9 mm) and has broad, flat flake scars on
both faces that appear to extend well beyond the
halfway mark of the face. In addition, the base
is pointed and the tip of the point is roughly
in the center of the width of the specimen.
The pointed base is reminiscent of the manner
in which fluting flakes removals are set up on
Folsom projectile points. However, the cross
section of the piece and the flaking pattern,
with the possible exception of the broad long
flakes, is not typical of Folsom performs, and
the pointed base is much more accentuated
than the typical isolated platform intended
for the removal of the first channel flake. The
longitudinal breakage along one side appears
to have been caused by a blow to the top
surface of the biface, while the blade break is
consistent with base thinning failures. Crushing,
originating from the break face, is present on
one face of the biface (see Figure 9-17c). It
appears to be post-depositional in origin. The
biface was recovered at 460–470 cmbs in Unit
14 and is assigned to AU 3.2. The second biface
discussed in greater detail is from AU 2 (Figure
9-17d). It is a middle reduction-stage specimen
that measures 52.9 x 48.7 x 20.3 mm in length,
width, and maximum thickness. It was broken
in manufacture but more significantly, the
basal edge exhibits heavy crushing along
approximately 18 mm of the edge (see Figure
9-17d). The crushing is congruent with the use
of the artifact and edge as a percussor such as
a hammer stone. Such chert percussors have
been previously documented from Folsom
and Clovis assemblages (Mallouf 1989). This
specimen was recovered at 380–390 cmbs in
Unit 1.

Miscellaneous Unifaces
Nine miscellaneous unifaces also have been
recovered from the site. They are unifacially
retouched flake fragments or complete flakes
that have no apparent use wear and therefore
a functional classification could not be made.
The retouch consists of a small number of flake
removals resulting in no significant changes in
the morphology of the parent flake.

9.7	Hunter-Gatherer
Mobility and Site Use
In this section, we focus on aspects of huntergatherer site use as it was ascertained from two
principal classes of artifacts, unmodified lithic
debitage and the chipped lithic tools. First,
we address the technological characteristics
of the lithic debitage and we follow this with
a discussion of the composition of the tool
assemblage and how it reflects on aspects of
site use and hunter-gatherer mobility. The
final section addresses one specific aspect
of the minimum nodule analysis, chert color
groupings identified among the debitage and
the tool assemblage.

9.7.1 Findings Derived from the
Lithic Debitage Analysis
Based on the work of Parry and Kelly (1987), we
assumed that low core-to-biface manufacture
ratios would be indicative of high mobility,
while high ratios would be representative of
reduced frequencies and ranges of mobility
(Bamforth and Becker 2000). While the small
non-debitage collection recovered from the
Vara Daniel Site did not provide a sufficiently
large sample for analysis, the moderate-sized
lithic debitage collection did afford us the
opportunity to differentiate and gauge the rates
of core reduction versus biface manufacture
over time.
To differentiate between core reduction
activities and biface manufacture, we recorded
Ecological Communications Corporation

the following debitage attributes: platform
faceting, platform grinding, platform angle,
and dorsal flake scar directionality. During
the initial stages of analysis we surmised that
debitage curvature would not be a meaningful
attribute given the large number of incomplete
pieces of debitage on which curvature could
not be reliably gauged.
The breakdown of platform faceting in the
debitage derived from the four analytical
units with the largest sample sizes (Table 9-4)
indicates that the percentage of single-faceted
striking platforms that are typically associated
with core reduction is highest in AUs 2 and
3.2 and lowest in AUs 1 and 3.1, respectively.
The shifts in these numbers between the upper
three analytical units suggests that significant
changes may have occurred in overall land
use and mobility strategies during these times.
The highest percentages of multifaceted
platforms, suggestive of biface manufacture
and associated increased mobility, occur in AU
1 followed by AU 3.1. The lowest percentages
of multifaceted platforms occur in AU 2,
suggesting that residential mobility may have
been reduced compared to the preceding and
subsequent site occupations. Unfortunately,
the small debitage samples from the upper
three analytical units make it difficult to know
whether the differences are the result of sample
size or actually reflect changes in huntergatherer mobility practices.
Striking-platform grinding tends to co-vary
with faceting. Single-faceted platforms tend

angles are anticipated with core reduction
(80–90 degrees) compared to biface reduction
(60–70 degrees). While the mean value in AU
2 matches expectations, the high mean value
in AU 3.1 is unexpected in that it suggests
relatively high proportions of core reduction
debitage in this analytical unit compared to the
impression derived from platform faceting and
grinding.

to be infrequently ground, while multifaceted
platforms are often ground during biface
manufacture. Table 9-5 indicates that the
highest percentages of platforms without
grinding occur in AUs 2 and 3.2. This pattern is
consistent with that noted in terms of platform
faceting and supports the observation that core
reduction was more prevalent during the AU 2
and 3.2 occupations than at any time before or
after these periods.
At least when it comes to the comparison of
platform angles by analytical unit, the mean
platform angle does not seem to be very
discriminatory among the different analytical
units. The highest mean platform angle is in
AU 2 (65.2 degrees), while the lowest mean
platform angle is found in AU 1 (60.2 degrees).
The debitage in AU 3.1 and 3.2 has nearly
identical mean platform angle values (64.3
and 64.1 degrees, respectively). Based on
experimental reductions, the higher platform

124

To seek some clarification of this aspect, we
counted the number of platforms with angles
falling between 80–90 degrees by analytical
unit. The highest number of flakes with platform
angles falling within this range is in AU 2
(n = 7; 14.9% of all platform-bearing debitage),
while the second highest is in AU 3.1 (n = 38
specimens, 12.3% of all platform-bearing
debitage). The lowest percentage of platformbearing debitage in this range is found in AU 1
(n = 2; 5.7%) followed by AU 3.1 (n = 6; 9.1%).
The patterns within this group of platformbearing flakes do support the earlier contention
that core reduction is more prevalent in AUs 2
and 3.2.
We surmised that dorsal flake scar directionality
also should be indicative of core versus biface
reduction. We anticipated that core reduction
would tend to result in unidirectional flake
removals originating from a single-platform
surface. In contrast, bifacial reduction should
produce dorsal flake scar patterning that is
multidirectional, since flake removals can
originate from the two edges as well as the
base of an artifact. The results of the analysis of
flake scar directionality are shown in Table 9-6.
The table shows that unidirectional flake scars
on the dorsal faces of unmodified debitage are
most common in AU 3.2, followed by AU 1. In
contrast, unidirectional removal scars are least
common in the debitage from AU 2. The pattern
seen in AU 2 is contrary to expectations derived
from the analysis of the platform attributes.

9.7.2 Findings Derived
from Analysis of the
Tool Assemblages
Although a relatively small number of nondebitage artifacts have been recovered from the
site, the composition of the assemblage both in
terms of manufacture strategies and functional
classes of artifacts represented is instructive.
In the section defining analysis units we have
already mentioned the low density of artifacts
per analytical unit. The density of artifacts
per cubic meter ranged from a low of only
7.19 items per cubic meter in AU 1, to 16.13
items per cubic meter in AU 2, to a high of
78 items per cubic meter in AU 3. While the
density of items increases in AU 3 compared
to the overlying AUs, the absolute debitage
density within AU 3 is still only an average of
about 8 items per 10-cm level within a 1 x 1-m
unit. These differences in artifact densities
potentially suggest a shift in the use or function
of the site within the overall hunter-gatherer
land use system over time. Slightly higher rates
of artifacts being contributed to the locality
during the earliest occupations (4.5–4.9
mbs), particularly in light of higher rates of
deposition, suggest more frequent visits to the
site. These frequent visits coincided with the
more dynamic geomorphological period when
both Barton Creek and the Colorado River were
contributing alluvium to the landform, and the
source of alluvium was in transition from the
creek to the larger waterway. The decrease
in artifact densities deposited in later times,
during the formation of AUs 2 and 1, suggests
less frequent visits to the site, particularly
during periods of reduced rates of alluvial
deposition on the landform. And, at least
during the formation of AU 2, rates of artifact
deposition decrease during a period when the
Colorado River is a more persistent contributor
of alluvial deposits to the landform.
So, the relatively low density of artifacts
contributed to the landform suggests repeated
short-term visits. The dominance of the lithic

Ecological Communications Corporation

tool assemblage by expedient and minimally
retouched tools that appear to reflect small
energy inputs in tool manufacture is consistent
with this interpretation. On the one hand, these
tools appear to have been made on-site rather
than brought there; on the other, the relative
under-representation of formal tools suggests
occupations tended not to last long enough for
the failure and discard of long-use life tools
(see Shiffer 1975; Shott 1989). Finally, the few
formal tools that are evidence of greater energy
expenditure in tool manufacture, and perhaps
curation, tend to be dominated by projectile
points. The only non-projectile point tools
recovered from the site are the two Brushy Creek
bifaces (adzes) and the perforator, and all three
of these items come from matrix derived from
2–3 mbs. The recovery of use-failed projectile
points, adzes, scrapers, gravers, and reamers and
drills can all be consistent with woodworking
activities focused on tool refurbishing,
whether it included the lithic portions (e.g., the
projectile points) or the wooden portion (shaft
or foreshaft) of composite tools.

9.7.3 Findings Derived
from Analysis of the
Raw Materials
The categorization of raw materials by color and
texture among the unmodified lithic debitage,
that is, the definition of minimum analytical
nodules, identified 40 color groups containing
three or more specimens and several other
categories with one or two flakes that were all
grouped into color category 99. Twenty-one of
the color groups were represented by sample
sizes ranging from three to nine specimens
(Figure 9-18). Of these color groups, seven
(5, 10, 23, 24, 27, 36, and 38) contained only
entirely decorticate debitage (see Figure 9-18).
In contrast, a number of color groups (4, 6,
12, 25, 26, 30, 37, and 40) contained less than
70 percent decorticate debitage. Color groups
represented entirely of small sample sizes and
consisting entirely of decorticate specimens

debitage in color group 2 suggests that the
artifacts from which the flakes derive were
decorticate or partially reduced. Among the
20 color groups mentioned above, there are
six other color groups (3, 7, 9, 15, 16, and
17) that are represented by 50 or more pieces
of debitage. Even among these color groups,
there are some notable differences in reduction
sequences represented. For instance, color
groups 3 and 7 contain 70 and 78 percent
decorticate flakes. Based on the author’s
experimental reductions, these percentages
are typical of the reduction of a nodular core
into a late reduction-stage biface. In contrast,
color groups 9 and 16 are represented by
relatively high percentages of decorticate
debitage (95 and 97 percent, respectively).
The differences in decorticate debitage in
these four color groups are indicative of either
differences in the degree of decortications
these materials underwent prior to arriving at
the site, or differences in what was made from
these materials once they arrived at the site.
Finally, while 41 color categories were
defined within the unmodified lithic debitage,
only sixteen of these color groups have
representatives among the tools identified in the
collection. Color group 1 contains the largest
number of tools (n = 13). This is not surprising
since it also contains the largest number of
unmodified lithic debitage. Furthermore, the
debitage and tool counts support the contention
that this color group consists of locally available
cherts, and the debitage derives from the on-site
manufacture of finished tools using naturally
occurring chert cobbles. However, while there
is a strong relationship between debitage
sample size and number of tools represented
by color group, the patterns are not exclusively
dictated by sample size. For instance, color
group 2, with the second highest debitage count
(n = 163), is represented by only three tools (a
late reduction-stage biface distal fragment, a
fragmentary expedient scraper, and a complete
minimally retouched scraper). Similarly,
color group 29 is represented by 22 pieces of
unmodified lithic debitage and also three tools.
In contrast, no tools are present in chert color

group 17, although 60 pieces of debitage have
been recovered at the site representative of this
color group.
This variability in chert color groups,
representative of flake removals from individual
or closely related (in terms of provenience)
pieces of chert, suggests that raw materials
were cycling through the site in a variety of
manners.
The combination of tools and debitage color
groups and sample sizes documents the
manufacture of tools from local materials,
their one-site use and likely curation off-site,
the bringing of finished tools to the site, their
rejuvenation and/or refurbishing and subsequent
curation off-site, and the on-site discard of
failed tools made of nonlocal materials. While
we cannot document the origin of the possible
non-local chert sources (e.g., color groups 2,
5, 8, 9, etc.), the debitage and tool analyses
have allowed us to demonstrate that they
likely represent raw materials introduced into
the site from nonlocal sources. The eventual
identification of where these sources may
derive from may be possible through detailed
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of
chert formations across the state.

9.8	Summary of Findings
This section summarizes the results of the
various analyses and organizes them around
four major questions:
1) Is there any evidence of pre-Clovis within
the assemblage?
2) Is there any clear evidence of Clovis
occupation or association of materials?
3) Are there any differences in mobility,
subsistence, and technology between
Clovis and late Paleoindian adaptations
manifested at the site?
4) Are there any indicators of the late
Paleoindian–Early Archaic transition in
the assemblage examined?

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

9.8.1 Evidence of pre-Clovis
at the Vara Daniel Site
Establishing whether there is any evidence of
pre-Clovis cultural materials at the site can be
approached from at least two complimentary
perspectives: 1) are there any deposits that predate the Clovis occupation, and 2) what are the
artifact diagnostics of pre-Clovis occupation?
In the western United States, Clovis sites have
been dated to roughly 13,200–12,900 cal BP
(Fiedel 1999). Fiedel (1999:110) suggests
a date of 13,400 cal BP for the expansion of
Clovis and also indicates that in several sites,
Clovis and Folsom occupations seem to be
contemporaneous (1999:103–104) around
12,850–12,650 cal BP (Haynes 1993; Taylor
et al. 1996). Recent dates from the Aubrey site
in Texas (Ferring 1995; Taylor et al. 1996)
indicate that the Clovis component there may
date to 13,350–13,500 cal BP. At the Miami
site in Texas, the age of the Clovis occupation
seems to be bracketed between 13,365 and
12,295 cal BP, and at Lubbock Lake, the
Clovis materials appear to be bracketed
between 13,050 and 11,610 cal BP.
The corrected calibrated calendar dates
obtained from humate samples from handexcavated depositional units of the site, with
one exception (Beta-260695), are consistently
older than 10,000 cal BP below 400 cmbs
(e.g., AU 3). Furthermore, humate dates from
a depth of 450–470 cmbs in AU 3.2 range from
11,250 cal BP (2σ; Beta-260690) to 13,080 cal
BP (2σ; Beta-260701). Radiocarbon dating
of soil organic matter yields dates that are
typically too young, or reflect minimal ages
of the soil because of contamination by recent
carbon (Wang et al. 1996). This would suggest
that the actual occupation dates within AU 3.2
are slightly older than the dates indicate. How
much older cannot be determined. Regardless,
however, the age of the deposits in AU 3.2
does overlap with the range of the Clovis
occupations documented in the state. In theory,
it also is possible that the dates derived from
the deepest levels of the site are older than
the occupation of the site. The contribution of
128

organic matter fractions through high water
tables such as near the junction of Barton Creek
and the Colorado River could have increased
the age of the humate samples. However, the
plot of the ages of the sediments by depth (see
Figure 7-2), shows a steady linear increase in
age with depth rather than a step-like jump as
would be expected under the contribution of
old organic carbon by high water tables.
From the brief discussion above, we surmise
that the deepest analytical unit at the site is
contemporaneous with Clovis presence in
the state. Given that the actual age of the
soil formation is likely to even be somewhat
older than the dates, it is also possible that
it may predate Clovis, although this is only
conjecture. However, because this possibility
does exist, it is necessary to look at what
evidence, if any, we have for a pre-Clovis
occupation of the site.
Proof of the material correlated with a preClovis occupation is difficult to obtain
because clear-cut diagnostics are not
well defined. On technological grounds
archaeologists (Collins 2000; Stanford and
Bradley 2002) have argued that the presence
of technologically sophisticated fluted
points and prismatic blades would imply
that a proto-Clovis lithic technology would
have contained the antecedents of such
technology. Such technological antecedents
may be manifested as blades (both macroand micro-), blade cores, and lanceolate
unfluted points. Blades are present in the
Nenana Complex (Goebel et al. 1991) and
have been recovered from Stratum IIA at
Meadowcroft Rockshelter (Adavasio et al.
1990). The Nenana Complex materials may
be contemporaneous with Clovis, and the
dating of Stratum IIA at Meadowcroft is
controversial. Blades and blade cores have
been recovered from the Cactus Hill site from
strata found below Clovis materials (McAvoy
2000). Microblades have also been recovered
from the Gault site (Collins and Lohse 2004).
They appear to be associated with the Clovis
component. While we have identified four
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

microblades, one comes from AU 2, which
is dated to 11,250–11,150 cal BP, and of the
remaining three, one is likely a burin flake.
The other two are part of AU 3, with one each
found in AUs 3.1 and 3.2. The small number
of microblades and their association with the
Clovis-age deposits suggests that they may
have been incidental by-products of lithic
reduction and do not represent pre-Clovis
materials.
Unfluted lanceolate projectile points have
been recovered from a number of sites
including Cactus Hill (McAvoy 2000), Mesa
(Kunz and Reanier 1994), and Monte Verde
(Carlson 1991). The ages of the components
containing these forms are disputed (with
possible exception of Monte Verde, Meltzer
et al. 1997). A single lanceolate dart point
proximal fragment was recovered from AU
3.2 (450–460 cmbs). The raw material from
which it is made is common in the AU 3.2
debitage, supporting the impression that it
is associated with this analytical unit. While
it is reminiscent of Thrall points, at WilsonLeonard the type was recovered from contexts
post-dating the Angostura type (Bousman et
al. 2004). The Angostura type dated to around
8090 ± 70 BP (uncalibrated; Bousman at al.
2004:Table 2.1) at Wilson-Leonard. This
date is too young for the materials associated
with AU 3.2 at Vara Daniel. If the lanceolate
fragment from AU 3.2 is not related to the
Thrall form, what technological tradition does
it represent? It is clear that it derives from a
lanceolate projectile point tradition and that
the form was not fluted. The straight base and
slightly contracting stem shows affinities to
Angostura, but the flaking is less-patterned
and the workmanship less refined, more
reminiscent of Angostura-like forms such as
Zella and Victoria (Birmingham and Hester
1976; Kelly 1983). Unfortunately, the ages of
the latter forms are unknown (Bousman et al.
2004). Nonetheless, given that the age of the
deposits in the analytical unit is consistent
with Clovis affiliation, it is unlikely that the
point represents a pre-Clovis intrusion into
the deposits.
Ecological Communications Corporation

9.8.2 Evidence of Clovis
Association at Vara Daniel
No Clovis points and prismatic blade
cores have been identified in the materials
derived from AU 3. In terms of tools from
AU 3, two end scrapers made on blades are
morphologically similar to those expected in
Clovis-associated assemblages. In addition,
four minimally retouched gravers, three from
AU 3, have been identified in the assemblage.
Even though they are morphologically
consistent with specimens associated with
Clovis occupations, gravers and end scrapers
made on blades are not exclusively associated
with Clovis assemblages, and therefore, it
cannot be argued that they represent clear
evidence of the presence of Clovis materials
in AU 3.1 and 3.2.
In terms of unmodified lithic debitage, a
single blade fragment from AU 3.2 has a
morphology typical of Clovis prismatic
blades. While three other blades also have
been identified in the assemblage, they are
not typical of Clovis prismatic blades. In
addition, 22 flakes have been identified in the
collection of unmodified lithic debitage that
are consistent with prismatic core platform
preparation flakes. The majority (68%) of
these specimens come from AU 3, although
about one-third were found in AU 2. The
fact that no prismatic blade cores have been
indentified from the site makes the presence
of possible core platform preparation flakes
unusual. The pattern implies that core
platform preparation did occur at the site but
the removal of blades did not, or it occurred
in hitherto unsampled portions of the site.
Perhaps more likely is the possibility that
some form of lithic reduction activity
produced debitage similar in morphology to
core-platform preparation flakes.
Overall then, the lack of artifacts that have a
clear-cut affiliation with Clovis occupations
in the assemblage leaves us with a small
number of tools (end scrapers on blades,
gravers) that can be found in Clovis as well
129

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

as other assemblages, debitage that includes
only a small number of prismatic blades, and
morphologically distinct debitage that may
be representative of prismatic core platform
preparation but could potentially be incidental
by-products of other reduction strategies as
well. Taken together, the evidence suggests
that the materials from AU 3 are not
representative of a Clovis lithic technological
complex. Rather, the presence of minimally
retouched gravers, end scrapers on blade
fragments, and a handful of blade fragments
are indicative of a technological affinity with
Clovis in both tool assemblage composition as
well as manufacture traditions. An alternative
explanation is that the materials in AU 3 are
affiliated with Clovis adaptations but represent
a technological stance within which prismatic
blade and projectile point manufacture are
under-represented. This explanation places
greater weight on the minimally retouched
gravers and also accepts the Clovis affiliation
of the handful of blade fragments.

9.8.3 Differences in Mobility,
Subsistence, and
Technology between
Clovis and Late
Paleoindian Adaptations
While a definitive Clovis association cannot
be demonstrated, it is possible to suggest that
the lower and upper sub-units of AU 3 and
the presence of the overlying AU 2 and AU
1 provide us the opportunity to compare and
contrast hunter-gatherer adaptations from
the late Clovis to the early late Paleoindian,
or roughly from 12,400 cal BP in AU 3.2 to
10,560 cal BP in AU 1. Of course, the small
samples sizes of materials found in the upper
two analytical units do limit the extent of the
comparisons.
The analysis of the unmodified lithic debitage
derived from the four analytical units (AUs 1,
2, 3.1, and 3.2) indicates that the percentage
of single-faceted striking platforms that are
130

typically associated with core reduction is
highest in AUs 2 and 3.2 and lowest in AUs
1 and 3.1, respectively. Conversely, the
highest percentages of multifaceted platforms,
suggestive of biface manufacture and associated
increased mobility, occur in AU 1, followed
by AU 3.1. These shifts in the proportion of
core versus bifacial reduction suggest that
significant changes may have occurred in
overall land use and mobility strategies during
these times. The higher incidence of bifacial
reduction seems to coincide with lower mean
annual air temperatures during AU 1 and AU
3.1 while the higher core incidence of core
reduction seems to correlate with higher mean
annual air temperatures during AU 2 and AU
3.2, as suggested by the isotopic composition
of freshwater mussel shells from the site (see
Brown, elsewhere in this report).
We noted earlier that significant differences
existed on artifact densities by analytical unit.
The highest rates of artifact deposition (124/
m3) occurred during the earliest occupation
(AU 3.2; 450–490 cmbs). This pattern seems
to correspond well with the higher incidence of
core reduction during these occupations, and
suggests that site visits may have been more
prolonged. Interestingly, however, while AU
2 also exhibits a high ratio of core reduction,
the rates of artifact deposition are significantly
lower (16.3/m3) than in AU 3.2. This pattern
of decreasing depositional rates may relate
to less frequent revisits of the locality. The
higher rates of mobility (e.g., more frequent
and shorter revisits) suggested by the
predominance of bifacial reduction during AU
3.1 and AU 1 appear to also differ somewhat
in character. Namely, AU 3.1 has four times
greater artifact densities per cubic meter than
AU 1. This pattern may be suggestive of more
frequent revisits to the site characterized by
short residence times during AU 3.1.
The lithic tool assemblage is dominated by
expedient and minimally retouched tools
made on-site and reflective of small energy
inputs in tool manufacture. This statement
is particularly applicable to the composition
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

of the assemblage recovered from AU 3.1,
AU 2 and AU 1. In these analytical units,
the assemblages are dominated minimally
retouched and expedient tool forms. The
relative under-representation of formal tools in
these analytical units suggests that occupations
tended not to last long enough for the failure
and discard of long use-life tools (see Shiffer
1975; Shott 1989). The composition of the
assemblage from AU 3.2 is slightly different in
that in addition to the expedient and minimally
retouched tool forms, miscellaneous bifaces
are also present in relatively high numbers.
The presence of manufacture-failed bifaces
indicates that bifacial tool manufacture
was a part of the reason for site occupation.
Interestingly, however, the lithic debitage
from this analytical unit is dominated by core
reduction materials, suggesting either that the
nature of site visits changed over time even
during the period encompassed by AU 3.2.

have been more wide ranging during the late
Paleoindian than subsequent periods.

The definition of minimum analytical nodules
(color/texture groups) within the unmodified
lithic debitage identified 41 groups. Some
of the groups are dominated by decorticate
specimens while others contain significant
proportions of corticate specimens. Similarly,
some categories are represented by relatively
large samples, while others occur in low
numbers. Among color groups represented by
20 or more specimens, one pattern evident is
that the higher the percentage of decorticate
specimens, the more likely that the color
groups are concentrated in AU 3. For instance,
of the twelve color groups with 20 or more
specimens and decorticate debitage exceeding
90 percent, eight color groups are nearly
exclusively limited to AU 3 (i.e., 90 percent of
the debitage of this color group is from AU 3).
Because AU 3.2 contains the majority of the
sample, statistically significant comparisons
between AU 3.1 and 3.2 are not meaningful.
Only four color groups with high percentages
of decorticate debitage are widely spread
between the four analytical units. These
patterns suggest that raw material procurement
and therefore hunter-gatherer mobility may

Paleoindian–Early
Archaic Transition

Ecological Communications Corporation

The combination of tool and debitage colors
groups and sample sizes within these document
the transportation of finished tools to the site,
their rejuvenation and/or refurbishing and
subsequent curation, and the on-site discard
of failed tools made of nonlocal materials. In
addition, the color analysis also documents
the manufacture of tools from local materials,
their on-site use, and subsequent curation.
The utilization of non-local materials appears
to have been more common early in the
occupation history of the site (AU 3) compared
to later periods. This pattern may imply that
the range of mobility, the distance traveled
by hunter-gatherers during the annual cycle,
may have been greater during late-Paleoindian
times.

Two dates (Beta-260694 and Beta-260691)
securely date the upper portion (330–340
cmbs) of AU 1 to between 10,760 and 10,160
cal BP. In addition, the presence of the refitted
St. Mary’s Hall specimen from 330 to 340
cmbs (Unit 6) supports the age assignment of
these deposits to the late Paleoindian. This then
suggests that the only Early Archaic deposits
from the site come from 320 cmbs and above.
The date of 8600–8420 cal BP for the deposits
at 290–300 cmbs in Unit 13 is consistent with
this conclusion, although a date of 9890–9480
cal BP from 292 cmbs from Unit 5 appears
to be anomalous, while the date of 7550–7410
cal BP from 290 cmbs in Unit 13 seems to fit
well. The peak in susceptibility values, the
peak in lithic artifacts, and the higher mean
annual air temperatures suggested by the
isotopic composition of the freshwater mussel
shell all suggest that the upper portion of the
deposits lumped into AU 1 are Early Archaic,
while the lower ones (330–360 cmbs) are
late Paleoindian in age. This pattern also
131

Chapter 9

Analysis of Lithic Artifacts

brings up the possibility that some significant
changes in land-use strategies and site use and
function may have occurred at this junction,
characterized by a significant lowering of
mean annual air temperatures near the end of
the Early Archaic.
Unfortunately, the assumption that only
deposits and materials derived from above
320 cmbs are associated with the Early
Archaic limits the scope of the comparison
and conclusions feasible related to this topic in
part because AU 1 included the upper 20 cm of
Early Archaic materials, and more importantly
because the sample sizes of materials (41
pieces of unmodified debitage; four projectile
points; two Brushy Creek bifaces; a graver,
two expedient scrapers, a drill, a distal dart
point fragment, and a miscellaneous uniface)
that could be securely assigned to the Early
Archaic are very small (total = 53).
It was mentioned earlier that the assemblage
of tools recovered from AU 3.2 represents
a mix of low-energy input tool manufacture
(e.g., expedient and minimally retouched
tools) and higher-energy tool manufacture

132

(e.g., manufacture-broken bifaces). The two
overlying analytical units (AU 3.1 and AU 2)
contain few tools and they are, with a small
number of items in AU 2 (e.g., two bifaces and
a reamer), low-energy input items. Similarly,
AU 1 only contains one discarded bifacial
artifact, and the other two artifacts from the
analytical unit are minimally retouched or
expedient. In contrast, the Early Archaic
materials recovered from 320 cmbs and
above (e.g., the screened materials) consists
of a variety of artifact forms (e.g., projectile
points, drill, bifacial adzes) that represent
high-energy inputs in their manufacture.
Only two of the ten items associated with the
Early Archaic is expedient in manufacture.
Unfortunately, the fact that the bulk of the
materials associated with this period are
derived from public screening would suggest
that artifacts that would be more difficult to
recognize among the unmodified debitage
would be under-represented. Therefore, while
the over-representation of energy-expensive
items is intriguing, how much is biased by
recovery mode as opposed to reflecting actual
differences in assemblage composition is not
possible to determine.

Snails and Peaclams
By Kenneth M. Brown

10.1	Introduction
Snail shells are recovered almost everywhere
that archaeologists dig in Texas, and they have
some properties that can make them very useful
for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Shells
can be destroyed by acidic soils (as in East
Texas), by groundwater dissolution, or by soil
heaving in clay-rich sediments, but they are
common in sites in Central and South Texas,
even ones with considerable antiquity. Snails
from the EComm excavations at the Vara
Daniel Site are very well preserved, and there
are no indications of excessive shell loss from
taphonomic processes. Sediments at the site are
for the most part relatively fine-grained, but
neither excessively clay rich nor excessively
groundwater saturated. Snails recovered in the
2009 excavations are moderately abundant,
well-preserved, and quite informative about
past environmental conditions.
This chapter reports over 6,500 snails (plus
a dozen peaclams) recovered from the
excavations from about the 2.8 to 6.2 mbs
level. All are native species—no introduced or
invasive species were encountered. This total
by no means represents all the snails recovered
in the excavations. Snails recovered by the
excavation crew from the field screens in 14
of the 16 individual excavation units are not
included in this chapter, which instead uses
sampling techniques designed to focus on
paleoenvironmental data. Human occupation
intensity in this part of the Vara Daniel Site
appears to be low, and it is unlikely that
human activity has substantially changed the
environmental profile that can be reconstructed
from the snail assemblage.

Ecological Communications Corporation

The
biomineralization
process
differs
somewhat for bone compared to shell. Animal
bone consists of an inorganic component,
hydroxyapatite, plus an organic component
(about 30 percent of mass; Lyman 1994:72),
consisting of a network of collagen fibers.
Collagen gives bone springiness and shockabsorbing properties. Snail shell also has an
inorganic component, calcium carbonate, plus
an organic component, but here the organic
component is only about 1–5 percent or less
(Goodfriend and Ellis 2000:54; Marin and
Luquet 2004:472), since snails are far more
sessile than vertebrates and have little need of
shock-absorbent shells. In arid and semiarid
environments, as animal bone is buried and
begins to decay, the process is initiated when
bacteria attack the organic component, opening
up the bone matrix, increasing porosity, and
exposing it to cracking and chemical dissolution
(unless exposure to fire and calcining removes
the organics first, improving its survival rate).
Because snail shell has little organic matter
to begin with, it is essentially immune to this
devastating bacterial attack. As a result, snail
shell often survives in older sites where the
animal bone has long since been removed by
decay processes. Unlike bone, calcining does
not improve survival rates for snail shell (nor
is it particularly deleterious); finely laminated
mussel shell is a different matter. I have seen
many archaeological sites, especially in South
Texas, where abundant snail shell has persisted
despite almost complete removal of the
extensive bone deposits that must have once
been present.
Terrestrial snails are moisture-sensitive
organisms. Unlike vertebrates, they cannot
133

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

travel far to find a source of water, and in
fact since snails travel on a mucus trail, any
movement results in moisture loss. Water
intake comes from contact rehydration with
water in the immediate environment, such as in
soil pores, or overnight dew on plant tissues, or
by ingesting green plant matter, and snails deal
with the threat of water loss mainly by estivating
and restricting activity during dry periods.
Because different kinds of snails have different
aridity tolerances, analysis of the kinds and
relative proportions of different taxa allow us
to assess past moisture conditions, at least on a
qualitative scale. Terrestrial snails might signal
drought stress by increased juvenile mortality,
reduced adult shell size, reduced population
size, or even localized extirpation, and these
are all properties that can be examined for
the archaeological collection. Most kinds of
snails are not particularly cold-sensitive; they
may be sensitive to overheating, but prolonged
extreme heat is more likely to be threatening
simply through desiccation. As a result, most
snails excavated from archaeological sites are
much better paleo-moisture proxies than paleotemperature proxies (see review in Brown
2006:970–979). One Vara Daniel species,
Gastrocopta procera, may be an exception.
Snails are small, rather immobile animals.
The larger-bodied species represented at
Vara Daniel are probably capable of traveling
only a few meters, and the smallest species
probably only a few tens of centimeters. As a
result, snails tend to be better representatives
of localized microhabitats than of regional
vegetation, but the localized microhabitats may
still be indicative of long-term environmental
trends. For example, consider a hypothetical
small species that prefers to live under downed
wood in woodland habitat. An absence of the
species might indicate a lack of deadwood,
corresponding to a lack of gallery forest, which
may or may not tell us something about regional
paleoenvironments. A principal challenge
in doing this kind of research is to correctly
discriminate paleoenvironmental signals at the
site-sized scale from those at the regional scale.

134

Although one species (Rabdotus dealbatus)
found at Vara Daniel is known to have been
used as a human food source in the Early
Archaic and later, no evidence has been found
of consumption by Paleoindian populations
anywhere in Texas. Rabdotus shells in
the EComm excavations were dispersed,
not concentrated in midden deposits, and
if Rabdotus consumption occurred at the
site, the evidence probably lies in deposits
stratigraphically higher and younger than those
investigated in 2009.
About 92 percent of the snails recovered from
the snail sampling column (see the following
section) are terrestrial snails, about 7 percent
are aquatic snails, and about 1 percent are
amphibious—that is, they can survive either
in the water or on land, and frequently move
between the two. These are rather typical
proportions for an archaeological site situated
on an alluvial terrace. Most prehistoric sites
are located on well-drained surfaces out of
the reach of smaller and more frequent floods,
and large numbers of aquatic snails are rarely
recovered except when excavations happen
to penetrate buried cienega or pond deposits
(the Lubbock Lake and Aubrey sites furnish
examples). Nevertheless, even though the
aquatic and amphibious snails are usually
less frequent and harder to identify than the
terrestrial component, they can be some of
the most informative species in the collection,
because they tell us something about past
hydrological conditions adjacent to the site.
About a dozen peaclams were also recovered
from the snail sampling column. Peaclams
are bivalves, not snails, but because of their
small size (average length of the Vara Daniel
specimens is about 2 mm) they may be
recovered where fine-mesh sampling for snails
is done. In this report, they are tabulated with
the aquatic snails and are described here rather
than in the chapter on freshwater mussels.
No fingernail clams or ancylids (freshwater
limpets) were recovered.

The 200 or so species of land and aquatic snails
native to Texas are represented by a variety of
body sizes (no historically introduced species
were found in any of the material examined). I
prefer to classify them as large-bodied (adults
over about 12 mm, represented here mainly by
Rabdotus dealbatus), medium-bodied (adults
about 5–12 mm, Oligyra orbiculata and species
of Praticolella, Polygyra, or Millerelix), and
microsnails (adults less than about 5 mm in
maximum dimension, represented by several
different genera: Gastrocopta, Pupoides,
Hawaiia, and others). Any of these body
sizes has the potential to be informative
about past conditions, but as a rule, for the
terrestrial species the micro-sized—those only
a few millimeters in height—tend to be more
habitat-specific. An accurate assessment of
archaeological snail faunas must consider the
complete spectrum of body sizes and must use
recovery techniques appropriate for all sizes. In
the Vara Daniel snail sampling column, about
44 percent of the terrestrial snails are largebodied species, 6 percent are medium-bodied,
and about 50 percent are microsnails. Among
the aquatic snails, about 8 percent are largebodied species, 44 percent are medium-bodied,
and 47 percent are microsnails.
Of the various kinds of snails recovered in
the EComm excavations, only Rabdotus,
Praticolella, Polygyra, Millerelix, and Oligyra
are large enough to be captured on the ¼-inch
field screens, and in fact many Rabdotus
juveniles and hatchlings fall through screens

with this mesh size, giving a severe undercount
of juveniles and a highly biased picture of
juvenile mortality. Moreover, not a single
aquatic snail was found in the one excavation
unit (Unit 13) for which the ¼-inch sample
was tabulated, despite the fact that substantial
numbers of juvenile aquatic snails were found
in some levels of the sampling column. Snail
collections made by excavation crews from
¼-inch field screens can provide valuable
information, but must be supplemented by finemesh sieving if reliable paleoenvironmental
data are wanted.

10.2	Methods
10.2.1 Kinds of Samples
Five kinds of samples (Table 10-1) were
collected and are reported here; the reasoning
behind each kind of sample collection is as
follows:

1A) Snail Sampling Column
After the excavation block was completed,
while the hydraulic shoring was being
repositioned, a column of 20 sediment samples
at 10-cm intervals was removed by the EComm
field crew from a section of the north wall near
the northeast corner (Figures 10-1 and 10-2).
Each 10-cm-thick sample consisted of two full
two-gallon plastic bags of raw, unscreened

were collected and processed. In the lab, each
roughly four-gallon sample was first measured
in a plastic container calibrated in liters, then
dumped into a plastic bucket. Two teaspoons
of sodium carbonate (to break down ionic clay
bonds) was added along with enough tapwater
to cover the sample, then the sample was
allowed to soak overnight. Next, using a stream
of tapwater under pressure (Figure 10-3), the
sample was passed through a nested series
of geologic sieves: No. 10 (2.0 mm), No. 18
(1.0 mm), and No. 35 (0.5 mm). The separate
grades, three for each sample, were dried and
bagged.

Figure 10-1. Plan of excavation block with snail
sample locations. Locations are shown for Unit
9 (4.9–5.0-mbs level only, fine-mesh sieved
sample), Unit 13 (field screen sample), the snail
column sample, and Auger Tests 3, 4, and 5.

Because many samples had a residue of small,
clay-rich nodules resistant to dissolution, after
the No. 10 and No. 18 grades were thoroughly
dry, they were again soaked in sodium carbonate
solution and run through nested No. 10, No. 18,
and No. 35 sieves again, then dried and bagged
by grade. All 20 samples were treated this way,
regardless of clay content.
I then picked the No. 10 and No. 18 grades,
removing all visible snails and snail shell
fragments, along with any hackberry seeds,
ferromanganese concretions, bone fragments,
mussel shell fragments, or microdebitage.
Non-snail items were returned to EComm
for analysis. The snail counts from the No.
10 and No. 18 sieve grades were entered in a
spreadsheet separately, but the counts from the
two grades have also been added together in a
separate spreadsheet for further analysis.

sediment. Ideally, each sample should have
been four gallons, but the actual volume
varied somewhat. For the column as a whole,
average sample size was 11.25 ± 1.13 L (range,
9.25–13.25 L). Altogether, 225 L of sediment

Screen in Unit 13 (2.82–5.0 mbs)
Although the snail sampling column was
collected as raw, unscreened sediment and
therefore should contain an unbiased sample of
body sizes, these 11-L samples tend to contain
relatively small numbers of the largest snails (at
Vara Daniel, these are adult Rabdotus). Some of
the samples from the snail column contain only
one or two adult Rabdotus, even when they
have much larger numbers of microsnails. To

remedy this and get a better picture of the snail
taxa at the large end of the body size spectrum,
I studied the entire collection from Unit 13,
which is the excavation unit located closest to
the snail column at the northeast corner of the
excavation block. This excavation unit actually
started at 2.82 mbs, on the irregular surface
left by machine removal of overburden, so
the uppermost level begins 18 cm above the
top of the snail sampling column. The snails
from this unit can be used to supplement the
data from the sampling column, and they were
abundant enough that specimens of four taxa
(Rabdotus adults and juveniles, Praticolella,
Polygyra, and Millerelix) could be measured
and used for metric studies. Note, however, that
while the ¼-inch sample covers 100 percent
of an excavation level, the column sample is
equivalent (on average) to about 11 percent of
an excavation level.

2A) Field-Screened Sediment
from Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs)
At the outset of this project, no one knew
if microsnails were even preserved at all
in the lower levels of the site. To check for
preservation, the field crew placed a plastic
field bucket under the ¼-inch screen and
filled it with screened sediment from a single
excavation unit in the lowest (4.9–5.0 mbs)
excavation level. This produced an extra-large
sample of 18 L of fill, equivalent to about 160
percent of the average size of one of the samples
in the snail column. The entire 18-L sample
was passed through a single No. 25 mesh sieve.
The particular 1 x 1-m excavation unit sampled,
Unit 9, simply happened to be one that was
being excavated when I made the request for
fill, and its location in the excavation block has
no particular significance. Because any snails
collected from the field screen had already
been removed from the sample, I also asked for
access to the ¼-inch collection from this same
unit and level, which forms the fourth kind of
sample:

and No. 35 geologic sieves.

2B) Snails from the ¼-inch
Screen in Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs)
These were also tabulated, and when added
analytically to the second sample type above,
the two together should contain the complete
spectrum of body sizes and be roughly equivalent
to the snail sampling column. Excavation levels
above 4.9 mbs in this unit were not studied.
Note that while the ¼-inch sample covers 100
percent of an excavation level, the underscreen
18-L sample is equivalent to about 18 percent
of an excavation level.

3) Auger Tests, Sediment
Passing the ¼-inch Screen
After the excavations were completed, the field
crew dug eight auger tests that extended from
the 5.0-mbs floor to a maximum depth of 6.2
mbs. Sediment from these tests was collected
in 20-cm increments and passed through a
¼-inch screen. Sediment passing the ¼-inch

137

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

screen in Auger Tests 3, 4, and 5 was processed
for possible snail sampling in the same way as
the snail sampling column, using the same No.
10, No. 18, and No. 35 mesh sieves. Samples
from these 20-cm increments were somewhat
smaller than the 10-cm-increment column
samples. The auger test samples averaged
8.67 ± 1.25 L (52 L for all of the auger test
samples altogether). This test was designed
to check for cultural material underlying
the hand excavations, but the samples also
provide an opportunity to examine a snail
fauna that probably predates the Younger
Dryas. Six of these 20-cm-increment samples
were provided for study, of which three were
picked and identified (Auger Test 3, 5.2–5.4
mbs; Auger Test 5, 5.6–5.8 mbs; and Auger
Test 4, 6.0–6.2 mbs); the remaining three were
not picked or sorted.

10.2.2 Identification and
Tabulation Procedures
Fine-sieved samples were sorted and identified
using a binocular microscope at magnifications
ranging from 10 to 40x. Microsnails were
placed in gelcaps inside small plastic vials with
printed labels listing the provenience and sorting
category (for example, “Pupoides albilabris
adults, complete,” or “Rabdotus sp. spires, age
indeterminate”). Snails from the ¼-inch screen
were sorted into vials with printed labels. No
sorted snails were placed directly into plastic
bags without protection from crushing.
The snails studied in this project are either 1)
complete, 2) fragmentary but identifiable, or 3)
so thoroughly broken up that they either cannot
be identified, or even if identifiable, cannot be
reliably quantified. Contrary to the beliefs of
many Texas archaeologists, broken shells are
not necessarily unidentifiable. Many of the
broken shells included in this study could be
identified, but when counting individuals, one
must consistently take care to count the same
part (the basal or apertural section) so as to avoid
counting fragments from the same individual
more than once. The taxon most profoundly
138

affected by this procedure is Rabdotus. Many
of the adult Rabdotus and a great many of the
Rabdotus hatchlings are represented only by
apertural or basal fragments. These can reliably
be recognized and counted if the shell hash
is carefully examined, and this taxon will be
drastically undercounted if the fragments are
not added to the tabulations.
The specimen counts in this study should
generally be regarded as Minimum Numbers
of Individuals (MNI) rather than Number of
Individual Specimens (NISP). In some cases,
a particular category, sieve grade, and sample
might contain only complete specimens (for
example, two complete Pupoides albilabris
adults; NISP = 2). The next level above or
below might contain one complete Pupoides
albilabris adult, and two adult basal fragments
(MNI = 3). The simplest way to deal with these
discrepancies in specimen completeness is
simply to treat all the tabulations uniformly as
minimum numbers.
Another minor problem arises when the No.
10 and No. 18 grades are sorted and tabulated
separately. Some taxa, most notably Oligyra
and Praticolella, sometimes appear to have
fragments of the same individual represented in
both grades. If a single Oligyra contributes some
large apertural fragments to the No. 10 grade
(tabulated as MNI =1) and some small ones to
the No. 18 grade (also tabulated as MNI = 1),
when the spreadsheets for the two grades are
combined, the calculated MNI = 2 will yield
an overcount. If the No. 10 and No. 18 grades
had been physically combined before sorting,
this potential overcounting would have been
eliminated, but the opportunity to examine how
size-sorting affects recovery would also have
been eliminated. From careful observation of
particular cases, my view is that this potential
overcounting is quite limited and affects mostly
Oligyra and Praticolella, taxa that in this study
are infrequent and probably underrepresented
due to breakage anyway. Broken shell occurs
in all the Vara Daniel samples, even the
column samples that were not subjected to field
screening, and all the specimen counts should

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

be regarded as a minimum count of the actual
number of specimens. These data are presented
in Appendix K.

10.2.3 Procedural Innovations
Some of the procedures followed in this study
represent innovations that have not been
followed in previous studies of snail faunas in
Texas.

Increased Sample Size
Similar snail studies have most commonly used
sediment samples of about 3 L in volume (or
sometimes less). I have long suspected that 3-L
samples are much too small when dealing with
sites in semiarid areas, or where depositional
rates and degree of preservation are unknown,
or at early sites where shell decay may have
depleted specimen counts. The relatively small
collections that have been made in the earliest
strata of sites like Richard Beene (total sample
size for Zones 1 and 2 = 224; Neck 2007:Tables
5.3, 5.4) or Wilson-Leonard (total sample size
for Unit 1 = 104; Shaw et al. 1998:Table 37-8)
suggest larger sediment volumes would be
advisable, although collections from the Folsom
site using 1.0-L and 1.4-L samples (totals, 611
and 768 exclusive of eggs; Meltzer 2006:Table
6.8, 6.9) produced adequate samples. At Bonfire
Shelter, the mostly 1-L samples used produced
an overall average of about 55 specimens
per liter because of relatively high counts in
the Late Holocene strata, yet yielded only 14
specimens for Bone Bed 1, Zone 2a, and Bone
Bed 2 combined (Byerly et al. 2007:Table
5, Figure 7). The 9- to 13-L column samples
and the 18-L underscreen samples recovered
at the Vara Daniel Site produced collections
that were adequate for interpretation, and
this probably would not have been the case if
smaller samples had been used. The oversize
custom sieves used to process the samples were
crucial in allowing samples to be processed
expeditiously. Davies (2008:5) standardizes
his British samples by weight, apparently at
1–2 kg, but samples like these would be far
Ecological Communications Corporation

too small for the more arid paleoenvironments
in Texas. Bobrowsky (1982:42–70) provides
an extensive discussion of sieve mesh sizes,
samples sizes, and rarefaction curves for snail
sampling, although I disagree with his position
on density measures.

Reprocessing
Reprocessing of the column samples added a
few specimens to each sample, either because
clay nodules released concealed items, or
because previously overlooked items were
found in the second inspection.

Shell Fragments
Previous researchers have not reported
anything about broken shell, yet the broken
shell hash represents specimens deleted from
the final counts. Broken shell was picked out
and weighed to check for stratigraphic changes
in breakage rates, and to get some sense of
how many individuals were being lost due to
taphonomic processes. Rabdotus accounts for
the bulk of broken shell in the ¼-inch and No.
10 sieve fractions. Careful inspection of the
shell hash can often show what taxa are being
broken up, even where it is not possible derive
a count from the remains.

Explicit Recording of Identifiable
Fragments and Juveniles
Most previous researchers have not disclosed
how they have dealt with fragmentary
specimens. Do they add them to the counts, or
disregard them? What about juveniles? In this
study I have recorded identifiable fragments
separately in laboratory notes, although in many
cases the counts have been folded together and
not tabulated separately in the data tables in this
chapter, for the sake of succinctness.

10.2.4 Taphonomy and Diagenesis
Snail shells from the EComm excavations
are generally well preserved. The chief cause
139

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

of shell loss is mechanical breakage, either
while in the ground or during excavation.
There seems to be little evidence of shell
degradation from chemical dissolution except
near the top of the section. Shells recovered
from the ¼-inch screen at about 2.8–3.0 mbs
show some dissolution and surface pitting, as
well as carbonate encrustations both inside
and out. Breakage rates for Rabdotus in the
3.0–3.1-mbs level are relatively high because
of chemical thinning of the shell; occasional
pitting and carbonate encrustations are also
seen at 3.2–3.7 mbs. These correspond to some
of the minor peaks in the pedogenic calcium
carbonate curve. Ironically, many of the very
small, delicate microsnails have either survived
intact or have lost small portions of the spire
that do not hinder identification. Praticolella,
Polygyra, and Millerelix and large-bodied
planorbid specimens are particularly susceptible
to breakage, hampering speciation and possibly
resulting in some undercounting. Occasional
small bits of calcined snail shell were seen in
the samples, but they are not common.
Throughout the section, some taxa are weakly
distinguished by minor color variations:
Pupoides albilabris and Gastrocopta procera
(with a gray tip) are characteristically beige,
while Gastrocopta armifera and G. contracta
are pure white. Otherwise, most of the shells are
bleached, except near the base of the section.
Rabdotus shells from about 4.5 to 5.0 mbs have
faint to moderate beige banding. This likely
represents staining by iron in groundwater,
rather than remnants of the original brown
bands on the shell of the live snail.

10.2.5 Taxonomic Uncertainty
and its Effects
Many standard biological procedures such
as rarefaction and species diversity estimates
depend on counts of species, but zooarchaeology
is often plagued by taxonomic ambiguity.
Ambiguity can result from shell breakage
or diagenetic loss of diagnostic characters
like shell coloration. It can also result from
140

the fact that some species cannot readily be
discriminated except by soft tissue dissection,
or even from the fact that the taxonomy itself is
in flux as malacologists revise their concepts of
taxonomic structure.
As an empirical example, consider the genus
Praticolella. Both Praticolella berlandieriana
and P. pachyloma are reported for Travis
County (Cheatum and Fullington 1971:Figures
11 and 12; Neck 1994:150). Most of the
complete Praticolella from Vara Daniel more
closely resemble P. pachyloma (Hubricht
1983:Figures 4–6), but there are one or two
specimens that resemble P. berlandieriana
(including a single one that is conspicuously
banded), and it is quite possible that both
species were present at the site. Furthermore,
this genus has been thought to hybridize
readily (Hubricht 1983), and some of the
intermediate specimens may be hybrids. The
shell of Praticolella is particularly fragile, and
many of the specimens that can be recognized
and counted by apertural fragments cannot
be assigned to species. The result is that
most of the Praticolella collection from the
site can only be identified to the genus level,
even though I suspect most are actually P.
pachyloma. How detrimental this might be
for paleoecological analysis depends on how
much the species differ in habitat preference.
In many cases, congeners have broadly
similar habitat requirements, so uncertainty
about speciation may not hamper ecological
interpretation very much.
The situation is even worse for aquatic
and amphibious snails. These are poorly
documented geographically, have fewer
diagnostic characters at the species level, are
more difficult to identify, and their taxonomy
is less stable. Aquatic snails are characterized
by phenotypic plasticity—that is, shell
shape within a species varies considerably
according to local environmental factors. As
a result, many of the aquatic or amphibious
snails in the Vara Daniel collection cannot
be confidently identified below the family
level (Planorbidae, Physidae, Lymnaeidae,
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Succineidae). Fortunately, this may not entail
a great interpretive penalty. Simply identifying
a snail as either a pulmonate or a prosobranch
aquatic species may provide most of the useful
information that can be gained from identifying
the snail in the first place.
The early history of malacology in North
America was marked by a frenzy of
overclassification. In the eternal tension
between lumpers and splitters, the splitters
clearly carried the day until the late 1960s.
Many new species were created, and then
these were further divided into subspecies,
most of which have now been abandoned as
invalid. Both terrestrial and aquatic taxonomies
have generally been collapsed and simplified
since the 1960s. In recent decades, the advent
of mitochondrial DNA analysis has thrown
classifications into further turmoil. Species,
genera, or even higher level taxa have been
combined, given new names, reassigned under
an old name with reordered priority, or split
into different taxa. For examples of these DNA
analyses and their effects, see Morgan et al.
(2007, Planorbidae), Remigio and Blair (1997,
Lymnaeidae), Wethington and Lydeard (2007;
Physidae), Wilke et al. (2001, Hydrobiidae),
and Yong et al. (2001, Biomphalaria). Although
DNA analysis has been shown to be feasible
for very recent shell (Geist et al. 2008), it is
doubtful that it can be applied to archaeological
material, in view of the cost and almost certain
degradation of DNA in very old shell.
DNA-based studies of snail taxonomy are often
done at the family level. “Representative”
species from different genera are analyzed,
one or more phylogenetic trees are produced,
and nomenclature is adjusted to the new
phylogeny. Unfortunately for the hapless
archaeomalacologist, the work stops here,
because the molecular taxonomists are not
interested in hard parts and regard them
as useless for taxonomic research. The
revised taxonomy is never related to the
existing spectrum of shell shapes. As a
result, it is essentially impossible to assign
particular archaeological specimens to these
Ecological Communications Corporation

newly revised, more realistic, DNA-based
taxonomies. Nearly all the existing literature
on shell morphology and perhaps all of the
existing comparative collections in museums
are probably coded in terms of taxonomies that
are now known to be inaccurate and superseded
by molecular systematics. Nevertheless,
archaeomalacologists must continue to use
these outmoded taxonomies, lacking any other
alternative.
The Physidae furnish a useful example of
this kind of taxonomic confusion. Physids are
pulmonate aquatic snails, cosmopolitan and
drought-tolerant, found in ponds, streams,
or springs. When Richard Fullington (1978)
produced his dissertation on the aquatic snails of
Texas, he concluded that all the nonfossil Physa
in Texas could be grouped in a single variable
species, Physa virgata (Fullington 1978:167).
However, at the same time, George Te (1978)
also produced a dissertation revising the entire
family. Following Te’s scheme, Burch and
Tottenham (1980:184, 188, 190) recognized
eight nearly identical species in Texas, all
placed in the genus Physella. Accordingly, I
assigned physids from Berger Bluff to Physella
virgata (Brown 2006:1136–1137). Burnside
(1998:102) had previously assigned Physella
from Texas to the morphologically variable
species Physella heterostropha. In 2003, Dwight
Taylor published a monographic study of the
Physidae (based on dissection of soft tissue)
that seemed to indicate most Texas specimens
would be classified as Haitia mexicana (Taylor
2003). More recently, Wethington and Lydeard
(2007:Table 1) have carried out a DNA-based
study that seems to suggest Texas physids
might fall chiefly into the species Physa acuta
as they recognize it. Wethington (2004) also
found that specimens previously classified as
Physa acuta, P. heterostropha, and P. integra
could all be classified as Physa acuta.
The preceding discussion should show why
most of the aquatic snails can only be identified
to the family level, with a few exceptions
(Elimia comalensis; Helisoma anceps; and
Cincinnatia, either C. comalensis or C. integra).
141

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

10.2.6 Juveniles
In some species (for example, Rabdotus
dealbatus or Pupoides albilabris), juveniles
are somewhat morphologically distinct from
adults, and where possible, I have tabulated
them separately. Tabulating them separately
reveals something about juvenile mortality
rates. However, there are many species
(mostly the disk-shaped or globular taxa like
Glyphyalinia) where morphology is more or
less constant across growth, adults differ from
juveniles only by size, and there is no distinct
morphological boundary between the two.
Furthermore, in some cases, even juveniles of
different families look alike; juvenile Polygyra,
Millerelix, Praticolella, and Oligyra all have
the same general body shape (the first three are
Polygyridae, the last Helicinidae). The older
subadults sometimes can be speciated, but the
youngest ones all look much the same.
Where the amphibious and aquatic taxa are
concerned, juveniles are not morphologically
distinct, but the juveniles recovered at Vara
Daniel are so far below the expected adult size
that I have had no hesitation in declaring them
juvenile, in nearly all cases.

10.2.7 Sampling of
Contrasting Facies
The EComm excavations at the Vara Daniel
Site sampled different kinds of alluvial facies
and the snail faunas that were recovered parallel
these geologic units. The lowest package of
sediments, at 6.0–6.2 mbs, was sampled only
by augering and consists of gravel-rich channel
fill, either the main channel or a side channel of
Barton Creek, the axis of which probably lay
somewhere to the northeast of the excavation
block. Overlying this channel gravel, up to a
depth of roughly 4.5 mbs, are point bar sands
that become progressively less sandy and more
silty upsection (Charles Frederick, personal
communication, 2010). This unit was sampled
mostly by augering, but the upper 50 cm
was exposed in the bottom of the excavation
142

block. The next package of sediments, from
about 4.5 to 4.0 mbs, consists of floodbasin
sediments. These are silts and clays deposited
on the floodplain as the channel axis migrated
away from its original position. They are
finer grained because the channel axis and the
principal source of sediment transport energy
have moved well away from the original site
by this time. They are also marked by a series
of small magnetic susceptibility and 13C peaks.
The lowest 1.7 m of sediments in the
stratigraphic section represent a classic finingupward point bar sequence. Geologists refer
to this style of floodplain evolution as lateral
accretion. The sequence of geologic facies is
matched by a sequence of snail faunas, and it is
clear that changes in the snail faunas are partly
driven by this process of floodplain evolution,
not by regional climatic change. Some of the
snails from this point bar sequence are broken
(splitting of Strobilops texasiana is especially
common), but there is no conspicuous
evidence of abrasion or stream tumbling, and
in general, there seems to be little evidence
of transport damage. Breakage could also be
postdepositional.
Above 4.0 mbs (approximately), the overlying
sediments are floodplain or terrace accretion
deposits, and from this time onward, the
composition of the snail fauna is determined
by interaction of the local habitat with regional
climate.

10.3	Results of the Study
Although the samples examined here evidently
span over 4,000 calendar years (including
samples from the auger tests), and the snail
faunas certainly evolved over that time, there
are some aspects that apparently did not change
much during the Late Pleistocene and early
Holocene. I will discuss those first, then look
at changes in faunas over time. It may also be
prudent to point out here that the snail data
integrate paleoenvironmental conditions over
a much smaller spatial scale than, say, stable

isotopes or sediment textural data. The history
of snails in the EComm excavation block is to
a limited extent the history of what happened
in the Barton Creek and Colorado River basins,
but it is also largely just the history of what
happened in the rugby field area as the terrace
aggraded. The most dramatic faunal shifts
are the geologically-driven facies changes in
the lowest 2.2 m of sediments, but there are
also changes in the snail fauna during terrace
accretion. Appendix K contains accounts of
snail species observed during this investigation
along with counts and density data for Units 9
and 13, the column sample, and the auger tests.

10.3.1 Overview of the
Terrestrial Snail Fauna
The composition of the terrestrial fauna is
striking because the large-bodied and medium
leaf litter indicator species that would
ordinarily be expected are mostly absent.
There are several woodland species (mostly
polygyrids) that are present in the area now
and would be expected if heavy deciduous
tree canopy were present. These include
Mesodon thyroidus, Mesodon roemeri,
Mesomphix friabilis, and Euchemotrema leai,
plus one microsnail, Zonitoides arboreus.
These all appear to be absent. Another largebodied woodland snail is present, Anguispira
strongylodes, but only as seven very small
juveniles at the bottom of the section; after
that, the species disappears from the record.
The absence of these species is not a result of
breakage. Even if they had been broken up on
the screen or in matrix sampling, recognizable
fragments would have been found. Polygyra
texasiana appears in modest numbers, but is
not as common as would be expected if heavy
woodland were present. All of these species
are present in Travis County now and have
been found in abundance at other (mostly
Archaic) archaeological sites in the area.
There are, admittedly, some microsnails that
inhabit leaf litter and downed wood. Chief
among these are Strobilops texasiana and
Ecological Communications Corporation

Euconulus trochulus. Strobilops is much more
abundant in the point bar sediments at the base
of the section (especially below 5.2 mbs), but
becomes infrequent above 4.4 mbs. Euconulus
is simply rare. The conclusion to be drawn is
that during the span of time represented here,
there was never any heavy deciduous tree
canopy on this part of the alluvial terrace. If
there was leaf litter and dead wood on the site,
it was limited in extent and small in scale. In
other words, the Strobilops population may
have been living under downed wood, but if
so, it was probably sticks rather than logs, and
less abundant over time. Most of the samples
in the snail column contained a few hackberry
seeds, but they were not very abundant except
in the 3.9–4.0-mbs level (and to some extent in
the 3.7–3.8-mbs level), where either a rodent
cache was encountered or an episodic increase
in hackberry trees was indicated. In many
ways, the Vara Daniel fauna resembles the
modern Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma faunas
reported by Neck (1987) and the Southern
Plains Gastropod Survey. Both feature
microsnails adapted to restricted microhabitats
in an otherwise xeric landscape and a fauna that
is depauperate in terms of medium-sized and
large-sized species. This does not necessarily
mean that the climate was Plains-like, just that
it was mostly treeless, well-drained, and not
very moist.
If, in fact, tree canopy was never extensive
during the span of time represented here, this
has some implications for the archaeology.
Tree canopy and dead wood (for firewood) are
probably important requirements for huntergatherer encampments, and the absence of
these might help to explain why relatively little
cultural debris was found in the EComm block.
Gallery woodland must have been present,
but it may have been limited to the banks of
Barton Creek and the Colorado River, where
it was supported by phreatic water. The rugby
field area was probably outside the border of
this gallery woodland. Trees are C3 plants with
a mean 13C signature of about -25‰, and if they
were mostly absent from the terrace surface,

143

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

they would not have contributed to the carbon
isotope signature in the sediments.
The seven terrestrial species that occur in
greatest abundance throughout the column
sample are, in order, Rabdotus dealbatus,
Hawaiia minuscula, Pupoides albilabris,
Gastrocopta procera, Strobilops texasiana,
Praticolella (probably P. pachyloma), and
Oligyra orbiculata. Rabdotus is the only largebodied genus, and Praticolella and Oligyra are
medium-bodied. At least six of these are aridtolerant species that can be found in open dry
woodland, brush, or grassland. The principal
exception is Strobilops, which is abundant only
at the base of the section, and declines over time.
The ratio of adults to juveniles suggests that
Rabdotus has a long-term trend of increasing
juvenile mortality that is reversed only briefly
in the middle of the section (at 3.8–3.9 mbs);
this may indicate increasingly arid conditions.
There are also a few species that usually
indicate moist conditions or the possible
presence of deciduous woodland, but they are
much less frequent. In order of abundance,
the principal ones are Gastrocopta contracta,
Glyphyalinia
umbilicata,
Glyphyalinia
roemeri, an unidentified slug, Helicodiscus
parallelus, and Euconulus trochulus. The two
species of Glyphyalinia occur in a zone that
features aquatic snails, so it is possible they
were introduced by floodwaters.
The assemblage composition suggests that
during the entire span of time sampled by the
EComm excavation block, there was never
heavy or continuous deciduous tree canopy on
this part of the alluvial terrace. There may have
been scattered trees or brush, but the habitat
here was probably an open, well-drained,
sandy, xeric terrace surface that became even
drier through time in the early Holocene. This
is a somewhat unexpected finding because
there are perennial water sources (Barton Creek
and the Colorado River) not too far away, and
because conditions were quite different at
Berger Bluff during roughly the same span
of time. The bench deposits at Berger Bluff
144

document much wetter conditions at about the
same time, although there are also signals of
the same post-Pleistocene aridification seen at
the Vara Daniel Site.
How much of this apparent aridity is simply
microhabitat-based, and how much is due to
regional climatic change in the Younger Dryas
and early Holocene? Much of the difference
between Vara Daniel and Berger Bluff may be
due simply to local topography and distance
to water. At Berger Bluff, the terrace surface
was probably much less elevated, and springs
or seeps were nearby. This may partly explain
why the site has a much less xeric-adapted
fauna. The rest of the difference probably has
to do with regional climate. Post-Pleistocene
aridification probably moved from west to east
across Texas, and Travis County was probably
affected earlier than Goliad County.
The pioneer British archaeomalacologist J. G.
Evans wrote,
Many workers who have been concerned
with using Mollusca as climatic and
chronological indicators have failed
to understand the way in which local
environmental factors control the
composition of a fauna. This applies
particularly to the moisture regime
which, as far as it affects land mollusks,
may be governed by local factors such as
the thickness and texture of the soil, the
character of the subsoil, the topography
and the vegetation, and not by the
overall rainfall value (Evans 1969:172).
In the EComm block, from 6.2 mbs up to the
beginning of the excavated area at 3.0 mbs, the
amount of sand generally diminishes and the
proportion of fines (silt and clay) increases, so
the water retention capacity of the sediment
should have increased slightly over this span.
On the other hand, the surface of the terrace
aggraded over three meters during this time,
perhaps making it better drained and less
prone to flooding (depending on the relative
elevation of the Barton Creek and Colorado
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

River channels). Most of the terrestrial snails
probably lived on or very near the site, although
the possibility exists that some (such as some
of the Hawaiia) could have been introduced as
clastic material by floodwaters, especially in
the lower part of the point bar sequence.
One last aspect of the terrestrial fauna is worth
mentioning—perhaps three or four species
recovered here are now rare or perhaps even
extirpated in Travis County. Fullington and Pratt
(1974:Figure 8) show Cochlicopa lubricella
as present in Bell County and Comal County,
but not Travis County. Pupilla muscorum
(assuming I have identified it correctly)
was probably extirpated early; the cryptic
reference by Neck (1994:147) is problematic.
Pomatiopsis lapidaria is apparently extirpated
from Texas entirely, as a result of aridification.
The unknown species of Vallonia found here is
also not reported for Travis County, and likely
was extirpated early. Another interesting finding
is that Oligyra orbiculata is uncommon at the
base of the stratigraphic section, and becomes
even more uncommon over time, disappearing
entirely from some levels near the top of the
column sample. This matches the findings
elsewhere in Central and South Texas. Oligyra,
practically a Holocene marker species for the
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric, seems to be
quite uncommon in Paleoindian sites.

10.3.2 Overview of the
Amphibious and
Aquatic Snail Fauna
For the entire sequence of sediments sampled,
including the point bar sequence at the base
of the section, about 8 percent of the snails
are aquatic or amphibious. This is normal for
archaeological sites on alluvial terraces. There
are several ways aquatic snails can arrive on a
site occupied by humans (attached to driftwood
used as firewood, in the digestive tracts of fish
or turtles brought to the site, as contaminants in
drinking water, etc.), but the most likely way
is for aquatic and amphibious snails to arrive

Ecological Communications Corporation

as clastic or floating material deposited during
flood events.
The most striking aspect of the amphibious
and aquatic component of the Vara Daniel
snail fauna is that almost all of the snails are
juveniles—not just young individuals, but very
young individuals, many embryonic or only a
few weeks old, only a couple of millimeters
in diameter. Snails like these would never
be found on the field screen, but show up on
fine-mesh geologic sieves. The near-absence
of fully grown adults is not a result of the
sampling method. No aquatic snails at all
were found on the Unit 13 field screen. There
is a single possible Catinella vermeta adult,
a single half-grown Elimia comalensis, and
some scattered fragments of an unidentified
large-bodied planorbid (presumably Helisoma
or Planorbella). Other than this, all the snails
associated with standing water or pond margins
are very young juveniles. There are two possible
models to explain this age distribution:
1) Hydrodynamic sorting. The shells arrived
on the site as drift at the extreme edge
of floodwaters. At the water’s edge, only
the smallest shells could be supported as
clastic material. Transport energy was
minimal at the water’s edge, so only the
smallest shells were deposited on the site.
2) Overwash from vernal pools or a Barton
Creek oxbow. Shallow swales existed
on the floodplain nearby, filled only by
rainwater or occasional flooding, not
groundwater-supported. Aquatic and
amphibious snails hatched in these pools
but died after a few weeks as the pools
dried up. Some took refuge under algal
mats, but died as the mats dried up. The
snails were later displaced from the basin
and introduced to the site area by flood
overwash.
The chief argument against the second model is
that the springsnail Elimia comalensis and the
hydrobiid snail Cincinnatia were also mostly
represented by juveniles, and these seem
unlikely to have been found in vernal pools. The
145

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

chief argument against the first model is that it
is unlikely that the same spot on the landscape
would have consistently been at the extreme
limit of floodwaters throughout the 4,000year span of time represented. On balance,
the second model seems more plausible. It is
also consistent with the idea that the floodplain
was experiencing aridification during the early
Holocene, and any vernal pools present dried
out rapidly.
Aquatic and amphibious snails are found in
both the point bar sediments below about 4.0
mbs and in the terrace accretion sediments
above that point. There is a dramatic increase
in the number of amphibious and aquatic snails
(expressed either in absolute terms or as the
ratio of these to terrestrial species) at about
4.0–4.6 mbs, with a peak at 4.3–4.4 mbs. This
probably represents the point at which a small
natural levee developed, high enough to trap
and retain water during overbank flooding. If
the levee is continuous enough, the portion of
the floodplain behind becomes a quasi-closed
drainage system that fills with water during
flooding and empties by a combination of
evaporation and slow drainage. Geologists
refer to this part of the floodplain as a flood
basin. The increase in amphibious and aquatic
snails at 4.0–4.6 mbs also corresponds to an
increase in the amount of silt in the textural
data (Chapter 6).
The aquatic snails in this floodbasin facies were
mostly pulmonates (Gyraulus, Lymnaeidae,
Physa, Helisoma anceps) the kind of snail that
can live in muddy, shallow, stagnant, poorly
oxygenated water, plus peaclams and succineid
snails (that might have been found on the
muddy banks of a swale) and a few examples
of the prosobranch taxa Cincinnatia and
Elimia. Among the pulmonates, over half were
represented by Planorbidae. Martin (1999:70)
notes, “In planorbids, the respiratory pigment is
hemoglobin, whereas it is hemocyanin in other
freshwater snails…. The increased oxygen
affinity of hemoglobin over hemocyanin enables
planorbids to remain submerged longer and to
extend to greater depths than either lymnaeids
146

or physids, as well as to consume oxygen
cutaneously during long periods of burrowing
in hypoxic bottom sediments….” Also present
is an increase in some terrestrial species (G.
contracta, G. roemeri, and Hawaiia minuscula)
that tend to float well as empty shells and might
have been swept off the floodplain as buoyant
detritus. Ostracode analysis indicates a slight
increase in the valve count and species richness
at the 4.0–4.3-mbs level (see Chapter 13),
which parallels the snail data. Snail density and
species richness also increase in this interval.
Extreme floods have been shown to temporarily
elevate snail abundance and species richness on
floodplains (Ilg et al. 2009).
As this particular spot on the landscape (the
area sampled by the EComm excavation block)
evolved into a floodbasin facies, both the
abundance and species richness of amphibious
and aquatic snails greatly increased. At times
the floodbasin probably supported temporary
shallow, stagnant, hypoxic ponds that served as
adequate habitat for pulmonate snails for at least
the first few weeks of life, and for peaclams.
Prosobranch species may have arrived during
flood pulses, only to die off from desiccation
or oxygen starvation. The damp, muddy
margins were good habitat for amphibious
species (Catinella, Pomatiopsis) and slugs.
As ponds dried, terrestrial ground cover may
have expanded into the floodbasin, possibly
furnishing habitat for terrestrial species. The
sizes of the different juvenile snails suggest
that standing water covered the floodbasin for
only a few weeks, at most.
Even if this scenario is correct, it is worth
repeating that almost all the amphibious and
aquatic snails are juveniles, regardless of
whether they come from the basal point bar
sequence, the floodbasin sediments above that,
or the terrace accretion sediments above that.
One last aspect of the aquatic component is
worth discussing. Parts of Texas during the
Younger Dryas were wetter than at present,
with precipitation more equally distributed
year-round, unlike the twentieth-century
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Snail Density
Snail density is high but fluctuating in the point
bar facies (then declining to a minimum at 4.7–
4.8 mbs) and in the lower part of the floodbasin
facies. It again diminishes to a minimum at the
point where terrace accretion sediments begin,
then increases slightly toward the top of the
excavation block (Figure 10-4). The quantity
of broken shell has a similar distribution (Table
10-2, Figure 10-5).

pattern of seasonal rainfall concentrated in
the late spring and fall. As a result, aquifer
recharge rates were higher and more constant,
and groundwater-supported discharge into
streams was greater and more constant. At
the end of the Younger Dryas, as the climate
warmed in the early Holocene and atmospheric
circulation patterns changed, aquifer recharge
rates declined, spring flow diminished, rainfall
became more seasonal, flooding became more
irregular and violent, small streams began to
experience seasonal drying, in-channel pools
became stagnant and poorly oxygenated, and
water temperatures increased (see discussion
in Brown 2006:Chapter 11). These changes in
aquatic habitat were probably more harmful to
prosobranch (or gill-breathing) snails than to
pulmonate (or lung-breathing) snails, which
could survive better in stagnant water. Elevated
water temperatures tend to reduce aquatic
snail density and species richness (Mouthon
and Daufresne 2006). Cold springs along the
Balcones Escarpment probably served as a
refuge for pleurocerid and hydrobiid species
as Holocene aridification progressed. This
proposed replacement of prosobranch species
with pulmonate species cannot be demonstrated
at Vara Daniel because pulmonate snails are
already more abundant in the earliest deposits
that have been sampled. Prosobranch species
only account for 5 percent of the aquatic snails
in the column sample.

10.3.3 Changes in Snail
Faunas Over Time
As the previous parts of this chapter have
emphasized, faunal change in approximately
the lowest 2.2 m of sediments (including the
lowest 1.2 m, sampled only by augering) are
largely geologically driven by the channel fill–
point bar–floodbasin sequence. Faunal changes
above roughly the 4.0-mbs depth represent
changes in the local habitat, mediated by
regional climatic change.

Species Richness
Species richness is highest in the lower part
of the point bar facies, then diminishes near
the top, then increases again to a peak in the
floodbasin facies, due to an increase in the
different kinds of amphibious and aquatic
snails (Figure 10-6). Richness begins to decline
at 4.0–4.1 mbs, near the point where terrace
accretion sediments take over, and declines
sporadically as the terrace accretes. There
is an increase in species richness in the last
sample, at 3.0–3.1 mbs. Increased diversity at
the top of the sequence is due to the addition
of some aquatic species and a couple of
terrestrial species such as Polygyra texasiana
and Glyphyalinia roemeri. The highest species
richness for the entire section (23 taxa) is at 5.6–
5.8 mbs. Taxonomic evenness and Shannon’s

148

Diversity Index both show a trend of long-term
decline over time (Figure 10-7), presumably an
indicator of Holocene aridification.

10.3.4 Rabdotus Juvenile
Mortality in Unit 13
Rabdotus dealbatus is one of the few species at
the site abundant enough to allow comparison
of the proportions of adults and juveniles. It is
also one of the few species where morphological
changes are clear enough and well enough
understood to allow fairly confident age
classification. The Rabdotus data begin at 2.82
mbs, where excavation of Unit 13 began, and
stop at 5.0 mbs, because the ¼-inch field screen
sample from the auger tests was not studied.

are juvenile, indicating high mortality in
the upper point bar facies. Survival is low
in the floodbasin facies, but improves to a
maximum at 3.8–3.9 mbs. This corresponds
to Beta-260688 (11,230–11,180 cal BP at 1σ).
This period seems to be optimal for survival
of Rabdotus to adulthood. After that point,
mortality again increases, and remains high

I used both a quick and easy and a more formal
quantitative method to define snail faunal zones.
I began with a spreadsheet of specimen counts
showing levels as rows and species as columns.
I converted these to density (number of snails
per liter of sample), then computed the mean
for each species column. I then highlighted all

the species hotspots lie in vertical space.
For the second method, I simplified the
density spreadsheet by combining columns
for adults and juveniles (for the handful of
taxa like Rabdotus or Strobilops where these
could actually be tabulated separately) and
by collapsing all the lymnaeid, planorbid,
and succineid categories into single columns
(Lymnaeidae, Planorbidae, Succineidae). This
produced a matrix consisting of 34 variables
(taxonomic categories) by 23 cases (levels).

Next, I did a cluster analysis of levels using
MVSP 3.1 (Multi-Variate Statistical Package,
Kovach Computing Services) to produce
both unconstrained (Figure 10-9) and
stratigraphically constrained (Figure 10-10)

more stratigraphically interpretable. The ratio
of cases to variables is less than ideal, but the
results are straightforward.
Cluster analysis largely confirmed the zones
selected by simple visual selection, but supplied
an independent way to select the boundaries
between zones. The faunal zones described
below are described in sequence, from earliest
to latest, and the principal taxa are listed.

three litter-dwelling (abundant Strobilops; G.

several arid-tolerant Plains taxa (Cochlicopa,

and low abundance and diversity of aquatic
taxa. Terrestrial snails are presumably clastic
material drawn from streambanks upstream,
perhaps from gallery woodland embedded
in an otherwise fairly dry (possibly grassy?)
floodplain. Cochlicopa, Pupilla, and perhaps
Vallonia are probably Pleistocene markers. The
banks of Barton Creek are now about 150 m
away from the excavation block, but during
Zone 1, the channel was adjacent.

because sample size varies somewhat. The matrix was also simplified by combining the counts

suggesting shallow, poorly oxygenated water;
some mesic terrestrial taxa (Glyphyalinia
umbilicata and Glyphyalinia roemeri, G.
contracta, Strobilops; plus continuing aridtolerant taxa Pupoides, Rabdotus. Due to
point bar migration away from the excavated
area, this area is now floodbasin and supports
aquatic taxa in seasonally filled and drying
pools as 30 cm of silty sediment accumulates.
Vallonia disappears at the top of this zone. This
zone corresponds approximately to a period
of increased magnetic susceptibility values at
Hall’s Cave.

Snail Zone 5: Upper floodbasin/terrace
accretion deposits (3.7–4.2 mbs; estimated
10,130–11,490 cal BP; Early Holocene). Most
of the aquatic taxa in Zone 4 disappear or greatly
diminish as the floodbasin evolves into terrace
accretion deposits. Cincinnatia and Elimia are
minor components, Gyraulus declines over
time. Rabdotus increases markedly in the upper
part, along with maximum adult survivorship,
Praticolella increases slightly, G. procera
continues in moderation, Strobilops declines,
G. contracta appears sporadically. Overall snail
density is low and species richness declining.

Snail Zone 6: Terrace accretion deposits,
coarsening upward (3.4–3.7 mbs; estimated
9320–10,130 cal BP; Early Holocene, including
Preboreal). Overall snail density and species
richness are slightly higher than in preceding
zone. Rabdotus and Praticolella are principal
taxa, Polygyra increases, snail fauna becomes
more Holocene-like in this zone (post-11,000
cal BP). Pupoides increases slightly. Hawaiia
declines, a few succineids are present but
peaclams are absent and aquatic species are
scarce as standing water on the terrace surface
becomes much more uncommon. Terrace
surface is fairly arid as it accretes another 30
cm, perhaps roughly comparable to today?
Snail Zone 7: Terrace accretion deposits (3.0–
3.4 mbs; estimated 8230–9317 cal BP; Early
Holocene). Overall snail density increases,
species richness declines to the 3.1–3.2-mbs
level, then rises again, due mostly to the
reappearance of a few aquatic species at the
very top of the zone. Rabdotus greatly increases
in abundance; Rabdotus survivorship increases
to the 3.0–3.1-mbs level, then declines again.
Polygyra increases; fauna continues to feature
somewhat more large-bodied and mediumbodied taxa, and to take on a more typically
Holocene nature. Mesic indicators like G.
contracta are scarce or absent; Glyphyalinia
umbilicata is present only at the base of this
zone. G. procera increases somewhat; Hawaiia
and Pupoides increase. The data seem to
indicate that the beginning and end of this
zone are slightly wetter, the middle part more
dry; slugs, aquatic snails, and peaclams appear
mostly at the base and top. A few lymnaeids
and some Physa are present in the lower half
of this zone, but aquatic species continue to
be scarce. As the terrace surface accretes an
additional 40 cm in the early Holocene (Boreal
period, preceding the 8200 BP cold event), the
sediment becomes finer grained, but the terrace
habitat becomes somewhat drier and the snail
fauna more Holocene-like. There are hints in the
3.0–3.1-mbs level of a possible shift to slightly
wetter conditions, but with no snail data above
this point except for the Unit 13 field screen
sample, this cannot be verified. The top of this
Ecological Communications Corporation

zone ends arbitrarily where excavations began,
possibly at about the same time as the 8200 cal
BP global cooling event (actually a cluster of
events from about 8600 to 8200 cal BP).

10.4	Conclusions
The span of time sampled for snails includes
much of the Early Holocene (or Boreal, in the
European climatic chronology, and including
the Preboreal cool event) and all of the Younger
Dryas; the deposits sampled only by augering
at 5.0–6.2 mbs likely extend back into the
Allerod (or pre-Younger Dryas) period, but
there are no radiocarbon assays at this level,
and accretion rates in the point bar deposits
were surely much higher, making it difficult
to extrapolate sedimentation rates backward in
time. The earliest sample analyzed (Auger Test
4, 6.0–6.2 mbs) is assumed to date from late in
the Allerod.
Samples from about 4.5 to 6.2 mbs represent
channel fill and point bar accretion deposits.
Most of the snails in the lower part of this
sediment package are probably clastic in
origin, rather than living on the point bar,
and they probably derive from somewhere
upstream along Barton Creek. Snails from
the upper part of the point bar may be partly
clastic and partly autochthonous. Point bars are
essentially disturbed habitats, usually with little
or no vegetative ground cover, and probably
with few resident snails except possibly some
amphibious taxa. In any case, without knowing
how large an area was being sampled, it is hard
to say much about the floodplain habitat. The
snails at this level have a decidedly Pleistocene
aspect. The large-bodied and medium-bodied
taxa characteristic of the Holocene, the ones
that archaeologists most often see on their
screens when excavating Archaic sites—
Rabdotus, Praticolella, Polygyra, Millerelix,
Mesodon, Oligyra—are scarce or even absent
in these point bar sediments. The scarcity of
Oligyra seems to be typical for Pleistocene
sediments (see Shaw et al. 1998:1574) but
curiously, it appears in small numbers here
153

Chapter 10 Snails and Peaclams

and actually declines even more in the terrace
sediments above. There are several taxa that
may be Pleistocene marker species: Cochlicopa
lubricella, Pupilla muscorum (assuming I have
identified it correctly), an unknown species of
Vallonia, and Pomatiopsis lapidaria. There are
cryptic references in the literature to Cochlicopa
and Pupilla being present in the area today, but
these may actually be reworked Pleistocene
shells. These taxa disappear in the Holocene
terrace sediments above the 4.3-mbs level,
except for Pomatiopsis, which occurs between
3.6 and 3.9 mbs. The first three are terrestrial
snails that today are more likely to be found in
the drier, cooler, higher elevation environment
of the Llano Estacado and South Plains.
Pomatiopsis is an amphibious, wet floodplain
species. There are no unusual amounts of
breakage or abrasion that would indicate these
possible marker species are reworked from
older deposits.
The sediments at this particular spot on the
landscape record an evolution from channel
fill, to lower point bar, to upper point bar, to
floodbasin. The floodbasin sediments contain
juvenile pulmonate snails that probably lived
in shallow, thermic, muddy, poorly oxygenated
temporary pools on the floodplain. Frederick
(Chapter 6) suggests most of this floodwater
resulted from the Colorado backing up Barton
Creek in flood. The age of these snails suggest
these pools existed only a few weeks (certainly
less than four months). Above the floodbasin
sediments, aquatic snails of all kinds become
uncommon, suggesting that although overbank
floods overtopped the terrace and deposited
sediment during the Holocene, standing water
did not persist long. Throughout the Holocene,
terrace clay content averages around 20 percent,
so flood duration must have been sufficiently
prolonged to allow this much clay to drop out
of suspension, but the snails give no indication
of persistent ponds on the floodplain surface.
During this period, the main channel of Barton
Creek was probably the only nearby water
source most of the time.

154

Samples above roughly the 3.7–4.5-mbs level
represent early Holocene terrace accretion
sediments, a loamy mix of sand, silt, and clay.
Frederick (Chapter 6) suspects a predominantly
Colorado River origin, on the basis of carbonate
content. The snail assemblage above this level
is no longer so heavily influenced by geologic
processes and presumably features a much
higher ratio of resident to floodwater-introduced
snails. The assemblage in the terrace accretion
deposits should reflect the local habitat (or
microhabitats) on the terrace surface, mediated
by regional climate.
This terrace assemblage lacks the large- and
medium-bodied litter-dwelling species that
would indicate heavy deciduous tree canopy
(Mesodon thyroidus, Mesodon roemeri,
Mesomphix friabilis, Euchemotrema leai, and
adult Anguispira strongylodes). Litter-dwelling
microsnails that would indicate this kind of
canopy are either absent (Zonitioides arboreus)
or much less common than in the point bar
deposits (Euconulus trochulus, Strobilops
texasiana, Gastrocopta contracta, Glyphyalinia
spp.). More prevalent is a suite of eurytopic,
cosmopolitan,
arid-tolerant
microsnails
(Gastrocopta procera, Pupoides albilabris,
Hawaiia minuscula), plus some arid-tolerant
larger snails (Rabdotus, Praticolella, Polygyra)
that typically live in very open woodland,
brush, or mixed grass and trees. Increasing
numbers of Rabdotus, coupled with increasing
Rabdotus juvenile mortality, a trend towards
decreasing species richness, and a decrease in
aquatic species, all suggest the terrace surface
is becoming drier in this early part of the
Holocene. Regarding the aquatic snails, the
disproportionate number of prosobranch and
pulmonate species and the fact that almost all
aquatic and amphibious snails are very young
juveniles suggests standing water was scarce
and very temporary on the floodplain—and
possibly even in the main channel as well.

10.5	Regional Climatic
History
In the following discussion, I will mostly revert
to uncalibrated radiocarbon years (RCYBP)
for consistency. At Hall’s Cave in Kerr County,
Toomey (1993:450, 475) detects a dry interval
at 12,000–10,400 RCYBP, followed by a moist
interval from 10,400 to 9000 RCYBP, followed
by gradual drying, culminating in a period
drier than at present at 5000–2500 RCYBP.
The Wilson-Leonard site is located in southern
Williamson County, much closer to the Vara
Daniel Site. At the Wilson-Leonard site, the
snail assemblage suggests “a gradual shift
from wetter conditions with riparian and marsh
environments during the early Holocene (ca.
9,000–10,000 years ago) to drier conditions
supporting prairie savanna vegetation
following about 9,000 years ago” (Shaw et
al. 1998:1599; I assume these are radiocarbon
years, not calendar years, though it is not
clearly stated). In the bench deposits at Berger
Bluff, a variety of different environmental
proxies indicate the Younger Dryas was much
wetter than present, but experienced a longterm drying trend that eventually culminated
in Holocene weather patterns at a date that is
unknown, but estimated at somewhere around
8500 RCYBP (Brown 2006:Chapter 11). At
Boriack Bog in Lee County, Zone B2 (Allerod/
Younger Dryas, 13,600–11,700 cal BP) is drier
than earlier deposits, but with aquatic pollen
increasing upsection and temperatures lower
than present. The overlying Zone C (Early
Holocene, 11,700–10,900 cal BP, or roughly
10,100–9600 RCYBP) indicates conditions
cooler and more moist than present, but
intercalated with short-lived drier, more arid
episodes (Boulter et al. 2010).
All of the above accounts agree on a wetter
period in the 10,000–9000 RCYBP range,
although at Hall’s Cave it starts earlier, and
at Berger Bluff it both starts earlier and ends
later (at Berger Bluff, the delayed onset of the
Holocene is thought to be due to early Holocene
glacial meltwater spikes in the Gulf of Mexico).

Ecological Communications Corporation

At the Vara Daniel Site, terrace accretion
begins perhaps somewhere around 9500–9600
RCYBP, and it is only after this point that we
can try to discern the effects of regional climate
change and separate them from geologically
driven changes in assemblage composition.
There is evidence of increasing aridification
in the upper meter or more of the EComm
block, but here the immediate habitat is already
conspicuously dry by 9500–9600 RCYBP. The
contrast with Berger Bluff is particularly acute.
These two sets of sediments partially overlap
in time, but conditions in the Coleto Creek
drainage were much wetter than in the Barton
Creek drainage.
If the Vara Daniel Site in Travis County began
experiencing Holocene aridification over a
thousand years earlier than Berger Bluff in
Goliad County, it should not be surprising, since
aridification was probably time-transgressive,
beginning earlier in West Texas and moving
eastward as time passed. Paleoenvironmental
research on a continent-wide scale suggests the
onset of Holocene aridification in the Plains
varied widely in timing according to local
conditions, but generally moved from west
to east (Williams et al. 2010:Figure 2) and
was most pronounced at 8000–10,000 cal BP
(about 8800–11,000 RCYBP). However, it is
somewhat unexpected that the Vara Daniel Site
would show evidence of aridification earlier
than Hall’s Cave.
Archaeomalacological studies consist of art
and science. Extracting the snails, correctly
identifying them, and assembling the numerical
data is science. Parsing the effects due to local
microhabitat variation from effects due to
regional climate change is art. A significant
amount of the change in the snail faunas is
probably geologically driven, representing
the shift from lateral accretion deposits to
vertical deposits as the Barton Creek floodplain
evolved. The remaining component of variation
represents the local expression of regional
climate change, as Holocene aridification
progressed and species diversity diminished.

Freshwater Mussel Shell Remains
By Robert G. Howells

11.1	Introduction
Freshwater mussels (Family Unionidae) are
one of several families of bivalve mollusks
that occur in fresh waters, with over 50 species
reported in Texas (Howells et al. 1996). They
are important in many aquatic ecosystems,
where they may be a major component of
system biomass (Negus 1966), contribute to
nutrient storage and cycling (Nedeau et al.
n.d.), improve water quality by their waterfiltering activities (Lyons et al. 2007; Nedeau
et al. 2000; Strayer et al. 1999, 2004), provide a
substrate turn-over mechanism (Strayer 2004),
support an array of associated commensal and
parasitic organisms, and provide a forage base
for mollusk-eating predators (Howells et al.
1996).
Native Americans harvested freshwater
mussels for food, used their shells for tools and
ornamentation, and took their pearls as well
(Howells 1996; Howells et al. 1996; Parmalee
and Bogan 1998; Williams et al. 2008). Unionid
shells, valves, and fragments are often found
at archaeological sites in Texas and elsewhere
(e.g., Chandler and Kumpe 1992; Howells
1998a, 1998b, 2002a, 2002b, 2005; Howells
et al. 2003; Murray 1982; Neck 1982) and can
contribute to an expanded understanding of
past activities at those sites.
Basic freshwater mussel biology can be both
interesting and complex (Howells et al. 1996;
Parmalee and Bogan 1998; Williams et al.
2008; and others). Adult unionids dig into the
substrate and do not attach to solid objects
as do marine mussels (Family Mytilidae) or
exotic zebra mussels (Family Dreissenidae).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Some species are generalists and may occupy
many different types of habitats (e.g., lakes,
streams, rivers, oxbows); others prefer certain
types of habitats (e.g., ponds), and still others
are restricted to very specific environments
and may not occur or survive in others (e.g.,
flowing-water, gravel riffles with little silt
and high oxygen content). Shells are made of
calcium carbonate (alternating layers of calcite
and aragonite) and those of many species often
survive long after their death, becoming an
important historic record.
Freshwater mussels are extremely sensitive
barometers of environmental quality. When
ecological changes and environmental
degradation occurs, these are often the first
organisms to decline and, all too often, vanish.
As a result of this sensitivity, significant
numbers of freshwater mussels in North
America are already extinct, endangered,
threatened, of special concern, or will fall into
one of those categories very soon (Bogan 1996;
Strayer et al. 2004).
Due to ecological and archaeological
importance of this group, unionids may
become a focus of the potential impact of many
anthropogenic activities.

11.2	Materials and Methods
Freshwater mussel (Family Unionidae) shell
remains recovered by EComm from ¼-inch
screens were bagged, labeled, and delivered to
me for examination.

157

Chapter 11 Freshwater Mussel Shell Remains

These shell materials were examined and
identified based on Howells et al. (1996).
Terminology followed that reference and
Turgeon et al. (1998), but with several morerecent taxonomic updates. Several presumptive
identifications reflect uncertainty associated
with natural morphological variation found
in unionid mussels, commonly occurring
deformities, and erosion and exfoliation
associated with dated archaeological and
paleontological specimens. Freshwater mussel
species previously reported from Travis and
Williamson counties around the immediate
study site, Burnet County (upstream), and
Bastrop County (downstream) are presented
in Table 11-1. Analysis results of each sample
are presented in Appendix L. Fragments of
unionid valves were also counted, but counts of
fragments should be viewed rather qualitatively

because many easily break into multiple
pieces during handling and transport. Further,
some fragments may come from a single
broken specimen, but in other instances, each
fragment could have originated from different
individuals.

11.3	Results and Discussion
Shell remains of six unionid species were
identified in addition to unidentifiable
fragments; both were counted (Tables
11-2 and 11-3). Species composition was
similar to assemblages reported for another
archaeological site downstream in Bastrop
County and an additional location further east
in Milam County (Table 11-4).

Chapter 11 Freshwater Mussel Shell Remains

11.3.1 Species Accounts
The following section describes the species
found during the 2009 excavations at the Vara
Daniel Site. These species accounts synthesize
data from Tables 11-2, 11-3, and 11-4.
Photographs of species examples, key features,
and specimens from the Vara Daniel Site can
be found in Appendix L. Photographs of recent
freshwater mussels presented were obtained
from BioStudies records and used herein with
permission. These images should not be used
for other purposes without written permission
of BioStudies.

Smooth pimpleback
(Quadrula houstonensis)
By overall abundance, smooth pimpleback
with 30 specimens accounted for 47.6 percent
of total identified specimens and was most
abundant. Smooth pimpleback is endemic to the
Brazos and Colorado drainage basins of Central
Texas (Howells et al. 1996; Howells 2009). It
has a particularly solid shell that preserves well
and endures over time. This species was also
most abundant at another archaeological site
downstream in Bastrop County, Texas (Howells
2005), and second in abundance at an additional
site to the east in Milam County, Texas
(Howells et al. 2003). Smooth pimpleback has
become rather rare in recent decades (Howells
2009) and Howells et al. (2003) found it more
abundant in older samples at the Milam County
sites, suggesting decline prior to European
impact. Although this is less apparent in the
current samples, the Vara Daniel Site material
is far older at its deeper levels than other area
locations cited here. It occurred in 24 lots at
depths from 270 to 350 cmbs, but was absent in
the 450–500-cmbs level. Smooth pimpleback
examples are illustrated in Appendix L, Figures
L-1 through L-4.

Threeridge (Amblema plicata)
Threeridge was second in abundance with 18
specimens, and accounted for 28.6 percent of
the total identified specimens (see Table 11-4).
160

This mussel ranges from the lower Nueces River
to the Red River in Texas, as well as throughout
much of the Mississippi River Valley (Howells
et al. 1996). It too has a shell that is particularly
solid, preserves well, and survives over time.
It was also one of the most common species
in shell remains recovered from the sites in
Bastrop and Milam counties. It occurred in
16 lots at depths from 291 to 500 cmbs, and
was recovered in all depth groups. Threeridge
examples are illustrated in Appendix L, Figures
L-5 through L-7.

Yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres)
This unionid was third in abundance with six
specimens and was 9.5 percent of the identified
mussel remains. Yellow sandshell has been
reported in all major drainages in Texas and
ranges widely throughout the Mississippi River
Valley (Howells et al. 1996). It was at the
Bastrop archaeological site, but was not found
at the Milam County location. It was identified
in five lots at a depth range of 300–360 cmbs,
but was not found in upper or lower levels.
Although yellow sandshell valves are solid,
they are often only moderately thick. Less
massive than those of smooth pimpleback and
threeridge, yellow sandshell remains may be
less likely to survive over long periods of time.
Yellow sandshell examples are illustrated in
Appendix L, Figures L-8 through L-11.

Tampico pearlymussel
(Cyrtonaias tampicoensis)
With five identified specimens, Tampico
pearlymussel was 7.9 percent of the identified
material. This mussel ranges from the Brazos
River south and west into northeastern
Mexico (Howells et al. 1996). It was second
in abundance at the Bastrop site, but present in
lesser numbers at the Milam County location.
At the Vara Daniel Site, Tampico pearlymussel
was found in four lots at depths from 283 to
330 cmbs and only occurred in the upper two
depth groupings. This species varies in shell
thickness and degree of solid construction in
different drainage basins; however, those from
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

the Brazos and Colorado basins are among
those with the heaviest shells (R. G. Howells,
unpublished data). Tampico pearlymussel
examples are illustrated in Appendix L, Figures
L-12 through L-14.

Texas pimpleback (Quadrula petrina)
Three fragments identified as Texas pimpleback
were found and represented 4.8 percent of
identified material. Texas pimpleback is
endemic to the Colorado and Guadalupe-San
Antonio drainages of Central Texas. The three
fragments identified were found in three lots at
283–350 cmbs in the upper two depth groupings.
This species was represented at the Bastrop
site downstream. Texas pimpleback is perhaps
the largest of the pimpleback-type quadrulids
(Howells 2002c) and is particularly solidly
built. Its shells would be expected to be able
to survive long after death. Texas pimpleback
examples are illustrated in Appendix L, Figures
L-15 through L-17.

Southern mapleleaf (Quadrula apiculata)
A single fragment was tentatively identified
as Southern mapleleaf and was 1.6 percent of
the identified specimens. Southern mapleleaf
ranges from the Rio Grande north to Oklahoma
and east to Alabama (Howells et al. 1996). The
fragment from the Vara Daniel Site at 480–490
cmbs (one of the deepest samples) was the only
specimen found. The fragment appeared to be
from a morphologically atypical individual
(confounding
definitive
identification).
Southern mapleleaf was found at the Bastrop
location downriver and more frequently in the
Milam County site to the east. This species too
can show significant morphological variation
between different river systems. Those in the
Colorado River are among the largest and
most heavily constructed, but juveniles are
substantially more thin-shelled than large,
old adults (R. G. Howells, unpublished data).
Southern mapleleaf examples are illustrated in
Appendix L, Figures L-18 through L-20.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Unidentifiable Fragments
A total of 302 unidentifiable fragments were
counted when these collections were processed
and were taken in 65 lots. Fragments were most
abundant in the 250–350-cmbs level (the upper
most two groups), with far fewer at deeper
levels.

11.3.2 Habitat Associations of
Vara Daniel Site Mussels
Among the unionid species found at the Vara
Daniel Site, several, including threeridge,
smooth pimpleback, southern mapleleaf,
Tampico pearlymussel, and yellow sandshell,
are tolerant of an array of habitat types that
occur in flowing waters in moderate to large
streams and rivers, as well as in lotic waters
of lakes and reservoirs (Howells et al. 1996).
However, there were no natural lakes in Central
Texas, and man-made impoundments are an
ecologically recent habitat modification. Texas
pimpleback has only been found in moderatesized streams and rivers; it is not known to
tolerate impoundment (Howells et al. 1996).
Yellow sandshell is a particularly active species
that sometimes follows flood waters onto
inundated terrestrial habitats (Howells et al.
1996). All six species regularly occur on mud,
stable sand, gravels, and bottoms that combine
these substrates (Howells et al. 1996). They
avoid substrates of deep, soft silt, deep-shifting
sand, scoured cobble and bedrock, bottoms
that are heavily covered with leaves and other
natural litter, areas with dense macrophyte
growths, sites with rapidly fluctuating water
levels, and regions of low water quality (low
dissolved oxygen, environmental pollutants,
high salinity, etc.). None of these six mussels
occur in small or temporary streams or ponds;
however, they may survive for limited times
in oxbow sites after being deposited by
flood waters. All require host fishes for their
parasitic larval stage; therefore, established
mussel populations require appropriate finfish
populations to successfully reproduce.

Chapter 11 Freshwater Mussel Shell Remains

11.3.3 Comparisons to Recent
Unionid Assemblages
All of the six species found at the Vara Daniel
Site are representative of the mussel fauna
expected in that area. Their relative abundance
is also within anticipated ranges for the region.
Among the 14 species of freshwater mussels
documented in historical and recent collections
and surveys from the four-county area around
the Vara Daniel Site (Table 11-1), no remains
from a number of these unionids were
found among the shell materials recovered.
However, some of these would not have been
expected to be abundantly represented at older
archaeological or paleontological sites. Species
like fragile papershell (Leptodea fragilis) have
thin, brittle shells that often crack upon drying,
thus reducing the chances of surviving to be
identified for an extended number of years after
death. Others like Texas lilliput (Toxolasma
texasiensis) prefer pond and backwater habitats,
so would rarely be abundant at or near larger
river sites. Washboard is typical of big rivers
and coastal-plain waters and would be more
common downstream of the Travis County
area. Still others like false spike (Quadrula
mitchelli) and Texas fawnsfoot (Truncilla
macrodon) are less-common to rare, endemic
mussels that are small in size and less likely to
survive (or more likely to be overlooked).

11.3.4 Ecological and Human
Associations
The Vara Daniel Site is located between
the Texas Hill Country and Coastal Plain
environments where different faunal groups
meet. However, prior to major scientific
analysis of local freshwater mussel

162

assemblages in the region, the Colorado
River was dramatically modified by a series
of impoundments including (upstream to
downstream) Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake,
Lake LBJ, Town Lake, and Lake Travis. River
environments downstream of Lake Travis in
Austin are still influenced by urbanization
and other anthropogenic impacts associated
with being downriver from Austin, associated
military bases, and industrial activity. Areas
approaching natural river environments are
not encountered until well downstream of
Austin and the Vara Daniel Site area. As a
result, it is difficult to directly compare recent
and current mussel assemblages in the Central
Colorado River drainage to those from the
Vara Daniel Site.
Mussel shell remains recovered from
archaeological sites can reflect signs of
human manipulation, including blackening
associated with burning, C-shaped valve
fragments broken along growth-rest lines
(suggesting exposure to high heat), drilled
holes, or other shell modifications (Howells et
al. 2003; Howells 2005). None of the material
examined from the Vara Daniel Site revealed
any clear confirmation of human manipulation.
These specimens may have been the results of
natural stream-side deposition.

11.4	Summary
Six unionid species were present at the Vara
Daniel Site. All were typical of the Central
Colorado River drainage and consistent with
other assemblages found in historic and
recent surveys, as well as those from other
archaeological sites in the region. None had
definite indications of human manipulation.

Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic
Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell
By David O. Brown
Just as locational and stratigraphic data are
necessary for a fuller interpretation of cultural
remains recovered from archaeological sites,
paleoclimatic data offer a more detailed
contextual view of the remains and the possible
rationale for subsistence and technological
choices made by prehistoric peoples. While
there is no single direct and complete source
of data for paleoclimatic reconstruction, a host
of data sets can serve as proxy indicators for
various aspects of the environmental context
of archaeological sites. Pollen, phytoliths and
macrobotanical data, macro- and microfaunal
data, ostracods and diatoms, soil carbonates,
and a host of other proxy indicators are available
for study, though all have some limitations
and many are simply not available in certain
depositional environments.
The stable isotope composition of molluscan
shells is one such paleoclimatic proxy.
Researchers have long known that many
mollusc shells reflect an isotopic equilibrium
with the animal’s environment. The percentages
of stable isotopes of oxygen, 17O and 18O,
incorporated into the shell vary with water
temperature in marine settings. In general, the
isotopic composition of the waters at the time
of shell construction will be recorded in the
isotopic composition of the shell carbonates.
While this equilibrium relationship is more
complicated in freshwater molluscs, especially
those in streams with a variable influx of
precipitation and groundwater, some degree
of paleoclimatic information is conserved in
the shell.
In this study, we examine oxygen and carbon
isotope data extracted from molluscan shell
Ecological Communications Corporation

collected at the Vara Daniel Site during the 2009
excavations. A sample of 41 shells from the
more than 60 individuals identified by Howells
(Chapter 11 of this report) as belonging to at
least six different bivalve mussel species were
submitted for analysis of isotopic percentages
of carbon and oxygen. Despite a series of
complicating factors, including very small
sample sizes from each level and the lack of
individuals from clear cultural contexts, the
analyses show some variability that appears
to reflect environmental and climatic shifts
during the Early Holocene period.

12.1	Stable Isotope Studies
It has long been recognized that the differential
distribution of the isotopes of oxygen and
carbon in molluscan shell can be linked to
environmental parameters. Extrapolation of
the modern distribution of oxygen isotopes
has been directly related to temperature and
precipitation regimes, and this relationship
has been used to infer past global and regional
climates. Measurements of oxygen isotopes
from ice cores, in conjunction with other data,
have aided in the development of a detailed
global climatic model extending back into
the Late Pleistocene. Since Urey (1947) first
suggested a relationship between the ratio of
18
O/16O trapped in marine carbonate fossils
and the paleotemperature of ancient oceans,
researchers have attempted to extend the
description of ancient climates millions of
years into the past and to develop detailed
regional models of past climates. Similarly,
the differential distribution of carbon isotopes
has been linked to carbon processing pathways
inherent in broad classes of plants. In recent
163

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

decades, both oxygen and carbon isotopes
have become important proxy indicators of
archaeological paleoenvironments.
Stable isotopes, some 300 of which occur
naturally in more than 60 chemical elements,
are defined by the number of neutrons within
their atomic nuclei. One isotopic variant is
typically dominant, while the others occur in
small percentages relative to the primary form.
Unlike radiogenic isotopes, which change
their form and atomic weight through time,
the total reservoir of stable isotopes remains
relatively unchanged. Differences in the
behavior of the isotopes of a particular element
can often be attributed to differences in their
atomic weight that arise from the presence or
absence of additional neutrons. These atomic
weight differences lead to variable rates of
evaporation, condensation, deposition, and
other behaviors among the different isotopes
that in turn lead to shifting isotopic percentages
under different environmental conditions.
Stable isotope studies, particularly those
focusing on environmental questions, have
generally keyed on low atomic weight elements
from hydrogen to sulfur. In part, this is because
these low-atomic-weight elements are among
the most common found in nature, but also
because the addition or subtraction of neutrons
from the nucleus of lighter elements results in a
greater proportional weight change and greater
tendencies toward behavioral differences.
Following early marine shell isotope studies
directed primarily toward tracking ocean
paleotemperatures, researchers soon turned
their attention to freshwater shell studies and
the reconstruction of continental climates.
Clayton and Degens (1959) used oxygen
isotope fractionation as a means of separating
between marine and freshwater depositional
environments. Keith et al. (1964) documented
the variation among freshwater molluscan
species in lakes and rivers from Saskatchewan
to Missouri, examining hundreds of isotope
fractionation readings from 64 different marine
and freshwater shell collection sites. In an
attempt to test the utility of freshwater shell
164

from different environments in environmental
reconstruction, they sampled multiple shells
of the same species from the same sample site,
they ran multiple samples from different points
on single shells of several different species,
and they ran comparative analyses between
shell and soft parts of molluscs. Their analyses
included a number of freshwater molluscan
genera that are typically found in the Colorado
River drainage basin, such as Lampsilis,
Quadrula, and Amblema. Keith and his
colleagues found that shell carbonates clearly
reflected the latitude effect in oxygen isotope
fractionation caused by a progressive depletion
of the heavier 18O as one moves northward
(Keith et al. 1964:1772). They also noted that
while there are slight differences between
different species in the same environment, the
differences between lacustrine and riverine
examples of the same species are much greater
than the inter-specific differences and that,
ultimately, isotopic fractionation is a result
of environmental differences rather than vital
effects or specific differences in fractionation
(Keith et al. 1964:1774).
Many of the early stable isotope studies
of freshwater molluscs used samples from
lacustrine environments. Stuiver (1968, 1970)
studied lake marls and molluscan shells in
cores from Pretty Lake, Indiana, Queechy
Lake and Henderson Pond in New York, and
Pickerel Lake in South Dakota. He noted
a distinct postglacial warming beginning
between 9,000 and 10,000 years ago, a cooling
trend between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago, and a
slight warming trend over the last 1,500 years
(Stuiver 1970:5254). These findings correlated
with pollen cores from Pickerel and Pretty
Lakes. Stuiver (1970:5256) concluded that
freshwater shells grow in isotopic equilibrium
with their environment and that inter-specific
variation was small, less than 0.7‰ in the
seven species that he had sampled from Lake
Huron. While his findings did not allow the
precise calculation of paleotemperatures, he
suggested that they were closely correlated
with the isotopic values.

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Fritz and Poplawski (1974) examined oxygen
and carbon isotope fractionation in gastropods
and pelecypods collected from lakes in southern
Ontario, as well as specimens grown under
laboratory conditions. They found seasonal
variation in oxygen isotope fractionation from
several lakes, with annual per mil change as
high as 6‰. Their results indicated that the
d18O isotopic fractionation was climatically
controlled, related to both temperature
and evaporation, but also associated with
flushing and lake inflow/outflow. Among the
first researchers to include carbon in a shell
isotope study, they suggested that d13C was
primarily controlled by dissolved inorganic
carbon (DIC) in the water source rather than
vital effects or food sources. In a subsequent
study of ostracods and molluscs in a core from
Lake Erie with sediments dating to 15,000 BP,
Fritz and his colleagues were able to correlate
some of the earliest isotopic changes with
documented changes in the pollen records and
paleovegetation of the lake area, while some
of the more recent changes were attributed
to shifts in lake hydrology (Fritz et al. 1975).
Combining d18O and d13C in a single plot
showed strong clustering of the values from
different periods, separating the clusters better
than oxygen alone. This covariance between
d18O and d13C in carbonates has been clearly
demonstrated in closed basin lakes, whereas
open basin systems and rivers tend toward
weaker covariance and a more limited range of
d18O values (Talbot 1990:276).
Dettman and Lohman (1993) compared δ18O
and δ13C in mussels from the modern Huron
River in Michigan to Paleogene unionids from
fluvial and lacustrine contexts in the Power
River Basin in Montana and Wyoming, using
high-resolution microsampling. They found
well-preserved seasonal variation in δ18O and
δ13C from both modern and fossil specimens,
and noted a strong correlation between the
modern specimens and measurements of δ18O
and δ13C in the Huron River. In a later paper,
Dettman et al. (1999) measured δ18O and δ13C
in molluscs from the Huron River, confirming
that seasonality is well preserved and predicting
Ecological Communications Corporation

that bulk shell δ18O values should closely
approximate the average parameters of past
environments. But while strong seasonality
was present in the δ13C measurements, they
concluded that the variation was not a simple
function of DIC in the stream. They suggested
that an indeterminate amount of carbon more
negative than DIC is likely derived from
metabolic CO2, whose source would be plants
in the streamside environment (Dettman et al.
1999:1055). This mixing of inorganic carbon
and metabolic carbon has also been noted in more
recent studies of molluscs by McConnaughey
(1989; McConnaughey and Gilikin 2008).
More recently, Geist et al. (2005, 2006) have
argued that the 13C signature of the large,
long-lived freshwater mussel Margaritifera
margaritifera is largely determined by diet and
metabolic activity rather than environmental
effects, suggesting that the analysis of δ13C
can be problematic as a paleoenvironmental
proxy. In the study of freshwater mussels from
Texas streams, however, Brown (1998, 1999,
2007) has found that while there is a certain
degree of independence in the δ13C data, there
is nonetheless a weak negative correlation
between δ13C and δ18O values, suggesting that
some degree of environmental information
could be preserved in the isotopic variability of
the shell 13C.
The reconstruction of past climates from
isotopic composition is a complex process
with many complicating factors (e.g., Faure
1986:442-446; Hoefs 1987). In the case of d18O,
the entrapment of the lighter 16O in glaciers
may alter the composition of the oceans,
ultimately changing the character of meteoric
water, and complicating the interpretation
of climatic effects during periods of intense
glaciation and deglaciation (Hoefs 1987:142).
Unfortunately, the magnitude of this effect,
which may complicate the interpretation of
Late Pleistocene climates, is only poorly
understood.
Even greater potential problems arise from
variations in meteoric water, evaporated from
the oceans and almost always much lighter
165

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

than the source water. While the nature of
the process is reasonably well understood,
actual precipitation varies widely in isotopic
composition. The isotopic composition of
meteoric water is influenced by latitude,
altitude, annual rainfall, rainfall seasonality,
and temperature (Dansgaard 1964). Although
global estimates have been constructed for
precipitation values (Yurtsever 1975), there are
many local factors that affect isotopic balance.
The result is only rarely a linear relationship
and, while some studies have suggested
temperature, precipitation, rainfall amount, or
latitude as the single most important factor, the
relationship is better viewed as a multivariate
one with critical factors changing through
time and place. In general, tropical and lower
latitude maritime isotopic composition is
influenced by rainfall amount and seasonality,
while in higher latitudes, temperature is a more
important criterion (Rozanski et al. 1993:811). Continentality, a measure of the difference
between stable, moderated marine climates and
extreme and highly variable interior climates
of large land masses, is also a critical variable
since interior continental precipitation tends to
be more deficient in the heavier 18O than are
continental margins (Rozanski et al. 1993:5–8).
The interpretation of the d18O of freshwater
lakes and rivers is further complicated by
the conflation of processes. Closed basin
lakes may be dominated by evaporation
that leads to relative enrichment of the
heavier 18O, while open basin lakes are more
temperature dominated and responsive to
meteoric isotopic composition. Rivers and
creeks may be almost totally dependent
on meteoric isotopic composition, or their
isotopic signature may be largely determined
by the composition of aquifer water, which
introduces a lag factor and perhaps mixing of
recharge waters in the equation.
Other problems with studies of oxygen
isotopes in biogenic carbonates are more
directly related to the organisms themselves
and their manipulation of carbonates. First of
all, while certain organisms appear to maintain
166

a near-perfect isotopic equilibrium between
ambient water and secreted carbonates, others
perform a biological fractionation during shell
secretion (Anderson and Arthur 1983:65–75).
This effect has been studied in laboratory
conditions, and while the general conditions
and species for which it occurs are known, it
is still not completely documented. Apparent
differences in isotopic fractionation also
depend upon shell mineralogy. The two primary
carbonate shell crystalline forms, calcite and
aragonite, as well as biogenic silica, are found
to have different d18O values (Horibe and Oba
1972). Unfortunately, though many freshwater
species are primarily aragonite, many also have
calcite and even vaterite deposits within the
shells, complicating the analysis of d18O values.
Worse still is the tendency of aragonite to be
replaced by calcite through time, in a process
that may alter values of δ18O.
Finally, there is a potential problem with postmortem alteration of shell isotope composition.
While this has been studied somewhat for
marine animals, there are few data available
for potential post-depositional alteration
of freshwater shell in active pedogenic
environments. Working at the Aubrey site
in the upper Trinity basin, Humphrey and
Ferring (1994) have discussed the pedogenic
alteration of soil carbonates in relation to the
isotopic composition of soil carbonates. Their
conclusion, based upon the literature, was that
the effect was minimal, that is, insufficient to
alter the original d18O of the meteoric waters.
While this probably holds true for shell
carbonates as well, there has been little study of
in situ isotopic exchange and the conditions or
environments which may enhance or hinder it.

12.2 Analytical Method
A total of 41 samples of mussel shell were
submitted to Coastal Science Laboratories,
Inc., in Austin, Texas, for analysis of the
stable isotopic ratios for both 18O and 13C.
The samples were selected from the 60-odd
shells identified by Howells (Chapter 11 of
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

this report), and included most of the identified
specimens of Amblema plicata and Quadrula
houstonensis recovered from the site. Table
12-1 shows provenience information and basic
shell characteristics for each of the samples.
Analyses of shell remains from the Denton
Creek site (Anthony and Brown 1994; Brown
1994, 1998, 1999) utilized several different
species and, while the overall sample was
small, inter-specific differences in isotopic
fractionation is likely to have added an
unknown amount of noise to the analysis. For
this reason, the analysis of shell carbonates
from the Richard Beene site was limited only
to adult individuals of A. plicata, the threeridge
mussel. Under ideal conditions, only specimens
of this species would have been analyzed at
the Vara Daniel Site since these large, thickwalled, long-lived mussels offered a larger
potential individual sample size with perhaps
less potential surface exchange area than
thinner-walled species. And more importantly,
the use of a single species would limit the
problem of analytical noise from differences
in inter-specific fractionation. Unfortunately,
somewhat surprisingly low counts of A. plicata
from the Vara Daniel Site (A. plicata is the
dominant species at many large riverine sites in
Central Texas) forced sampling the dominant
mussel species, Q. houstonensis, along with A.
plicata, the second most numerous species in
the collection.
Since no single species was recovered in
sufficient quantities, 24 of the 30 individuals
of Q. houstonensis identified at the site and
17 of the 18 A. plicata shells were included in
the sample. None of the minor bivalve species
recovered from the site (which included
Lampsilis teres, Cyrtonaias tampicoensis,
Quadrula petrina, and Q. apiculata, a total of
15 individuals) were selected for the analysis.
To mitigate some of the problems with this
bi-specific analysis, the isotopic values of each
were treated separately in the initial analyses, a
method that actually results in two independent
samples that could strengthen the analysis.

The primary sampled species, Q. houstonensis,
also known as the smooth pimpleback, generally
lacks the pustules found in Q. quadrula, Q.
pustulosa, Q. nodulata, and other species in
this genus. Limited to the central region of the
state, Q. houstonensis is endemic to the middle
Colorado and Brazos River drainages (Howells
2002c). It is a moderately large-shelled and
long-lived species found in a wide range of
aquatic habitats, but typically in mud, sand, or
gravel beds of small to medium-sized rivers with
slow to moderate flow rates (Howells 2002c:8;
Howells et al. 1996:112–113). Heller (1990)
estimates the maximum age of individuals in
the Quadrula genus at about 60 years.
The threeridge mussel, A. plicata, is a large,
heavy-walled unionid characterized by three
pronounced ridges on the shell exterior. In
addition to their size and thick, solid shells,
which made them attractive to the historic shell
button industry, they are found in a wide range
of aquatic environments in streams, rivers,
lakes and sloughs (Howells et al. 1996:33–35).
They live at water depths from 2.5 cm to 1.5
m (and perhaps much greater), inhabit a range
of substrates, and tolerate low water conditions
and droughts. The threeridge mussel is found
throughout much of Texas east of the Pecos,
and is a common clam in archaeological
deposits. A. plicata is listed by Heller (1990)
as having a life span of only 16 years, though
larger specimens may live considerably longer.
In previous analyses (Anthony and Brown
1994; Brown 1994, 1998, 1999, 2007; Brown
et al. 2007), shell was optimally selected from
cultural features at sites in Denton and Bexar
counties. This insured that the shells were truly
contemporary with human occupations at the
sites and that the individuals from a selected
feature would, even though they might be
of different ages, have been collected by the
inhabitants at about the same time and would
have likely had some degree of identical
short-term climatic history incorporated into
their shells. Unfortunately, no shell features
were present at the Vara Daniel Site, and the
human collection of all or even most of the

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

samples from the site cannot be assured. Some
may well have been brought in by raccoons,
perennial shell gatherers, and could reflect
other seasons than the human occupation,
perhaps occurring years before or after the
occupation and reflecting a different shortterm climatic regime. Other shells could
have even been brought to the site as fossils,
perhaps as blanks for tool manufacture
or even informal tool usage, though none
showed clear evidence of utilization, or
may have washed in during floods. In the
latter case, these naturally introduced shells
could have been long dead and completely
unrepresentative of the climatic regime during
site occupation. Still others could have been
washed in from some distance upstream, where
different hydrological and meteorological
characteristics might have left a very different
isotopic signature. To mitigate this potential
deficiency, as large a sample as possible was
selected for analysis, but it should nonetheless
be expected that the variability in isotopic
composition between shells in a particular
level, which likely includes shells collected
at different occasions under slightly different
conditions, and perhaps even including the
occasional completely unrelated, washed-in
shell, would be greater than that of a series of
contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous
specimens.
The selection of valves from cultural features
can introduce another unintended type of
error if two halves of the same shell from the
same feature were both selected, thus biasing
the analysis towards that value. Analysis of
the shells from the Richard Beene site was
limited to either only right or left valves from
any feature or level to avoid this bias, but the
lack of cultural features and the limited sample
from the Vara Daniel Site complicated this
general safeguard. Of the total of 41 shells
sampled from Vara Daniel, 23 were right
valves, 16 were left valves, and two were too
incomplete to be identified. The total sample
from the Vara Daniel Site included 17 different
vertical provenience sets, 12 of which had
multiple individuals. Seven of these 12 had
Ecological Communications Corporation

three or more individuals. Only five of the 12
multiple sample groups were able to achieve
the goal of using only right or left valves from
a single provenience; in all but two of these,
however, the potentially paired valves were
from widely spaced units, eliminating some
of the likelihood of sampling bias. In the end,
only two sample pairs, A. plicata samples 26
and 27 from the 291–303-cm depth in Unit 9,
and Q. houstonensis samples 24 and 25 from
300 to 310 cmbs in Unit 8, had δ18O values
within the maximum overall sampling error
of ± 0.2.1 Examining carbon isotope values for
these potentially related samples suggests that
they are farther apart, with both paired samples
falling outside the projected instrument error
(the repeated carbon samples showed six with
no change, six with 0.1‰ variability, and only
two with 0.2‰ δ13C variability, for a mean
error of 0.07‰ δ13C).
Samples for analysis were taken by crushing
approximately half of a single valve from
anterior to posterior margin. This bulk
sampling technique roughly approximates the
method used by Keith et al. (1964) and other
researchers who have used sections across the
dorsal surface of the shell. Using the entire half
valve maximizes the influence of later years in
the clam’s life, represented by the outermost
layers of the shell, and thus helps to minimize
extreme short-term variation in climatic patterns
than may be inherent in short-lived molluscs
such as terrestrial gastropods, which typically
have life spans ranging from a few months
to three or four years (Heller 1990:286–288).
In contrast, large mussels may live as long as
50 to 75 years (Heller 1990:293; Raymond
Neck, personal communication, 1993; Robert
Howells, personal communication, 2009). All
of the specimens selected for the study were
adult individuals, thought to be at least a decade
in age, and some perhaps much older, though
1 The error is here calculated from 15 repeated
samples, of which two were identical, ten
varied by 0.1‰ and three varied by 0.2‰ δ18O,
an average instrumental measurement error of
0.11‰ among the repeated samples.
169

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

there is considerable variation in individual
clam sizes.
Bulk shell sampling as utilized here obviously
does not provide the same degree of precision
as high-resolution microsampling of shell
sections. Microsampling along the length
of the shell has been used in recent decades
to reconstruct not only climatic seasonality,
but also variability on a monthly, weekly,
and perhaps even daily basis in some cases
(Reische 1998; Schöne et al. 2002). While such
sampling could ultimately revolutionize the
field of paleoclimatic research, it is costly, timeconsuming, and requires some assumptions
regarding shell growth. Additionally, it is all but
impossible to establish a precise date to anchor
such high-resolution fossil shell chronologies
to absolute time scales.
Kenneth Winters (personal communication,
2003) of Coastal Science Laboratories provided
the following description of their analytical
methods that have not changed since the
Richard Beene samples were studied in 2003.
Shell samples were broken and ground
with a glass mortar and pestle. Pieces
of each large sample were selected
for grinding, which approximated the
composition of the whole shell. The
remaining pieces were saved for other
studies. Sample material that passed a
140-mesh sieve was used for analysis.
Samples were acidified with 100 percent
phosphoric acid at 30º ± 1 in a water bath.
(McCrea 1950). Appropriate laboratory
working standards and NIST standards
were acidified and analyzed along with
each batch of samples analyzed. Stable
isotope values of samples and standards
were determined by analysis in a VG
Micromass Series II Model 10 triple
collector mass spectrometer. Data from
each batch of samples was calculated
by comparison with data obtained from
standards analyzed with each batch.

170

As noted above, 15 of the 41 total samples were
run twice for both δ18O and δ13C to verify the
accuracy of the results. Seven of the δ13C and
two of the δ18O sample values were identical,
while seven of the δ13C and ten of the δ18O
values varied by 0.1‰. Only one of the δ13C
and three of the δ18O sample values varied by as
much as 0.2‰. Mean measurement error for all
δ13C values was 0.07‰, while δ18O error was
0.11‰. Coastal Science Laboratories suggests
that the results are accurate to within 0.2‰.

12.3 Analytical Results
Table 12-2 shows the δ18O and δ13C values for
each sample along with the repeat values and
the estimated date. The dates are estimated
by interpolation from the calibrated intercept
values of bulk sediment carbon analyses
provided by Beta Analytic. Sample values for
δ18O range from -0.9 to -3.4‰, a total range
of 2.9‰. The mean of δ18O values is -2.1‰
and the standard deviation is 0.6‰. The mean
of δ18O values for Q. houstonensis is -1.9‰
while A. plicata yields a slightly lower mean of
-2.4‰ (the δ18O mean of 34 A. plicata samples
from a somewhat later Holocene context at the
Richard Beene site along the Medina River
in Bexar County was -2.8‰, as reported in
Brown 2007). Values for δ13C range from -4.7
to -8.4‰, a range of 3.7‰. The mean for δ13C
is -6.2‰ and standard deviation is 0.9‰. The
mean of δ13C for Q. houstonensis is -6.3‰ and
for A. plicata is -6.1‰ (the δ13C mean of A.
plicata samples from the Richard Beene site
was -6.6‰).
The estimated dates presented in Table 12-2
represent simple mathematical interpolation
of the bulk sediment dates from Beta Analytic.
The 41 samples come from 17 excavation
levels from 270 to 500 cmbs (note that the
specimens from 291 to 303 cmbs in Unit 9 are
included with materials from levels between
290 and 300 cmbs). Shell remains were
identified from every unit of the excavation,
although the level-by-level remains are
overall very sparsely distributed. Five groups

(at 280, 370, 420, 460 and 500 cmbs) contain
a single specimen, and four of the five feature
a single A. plicata shell. Five groups have two
specimens each; all but one group feature two
Q. houstonensis shells. Additionally, there are
three groups of three specimens each, one of
Q. houstonensis, another of A. plicata, and a
third mixed. Finally, there were three groups
of four specimens each and one with five, all
with mixed species. The mean of grouped
means for Q. houstonensis was -6.33‰ for
δ13C and ‑1.93‰ for δ18O, essentially identical
to the overall group mean for that species.
The mean of group means for A. plicata was
-6.01‰ for δ13Cand -2.26‰ for δ18O, only
slightly greater than the overall means.
Bulk sediment dates are notoriously unreliable,
combining unknown quantities of organic
and inorganic carbon derived from both
alluvial and pedogenic sources (Forman and
Miller 1989; Gilet-Blein et al. 1980; Martin
and Johnson 1995; O’Brien and Stout 1977;
Wang et al. 1996). At Applewhite Reservoir
in southern Bexar County, comparison of bulk
soil dates to conventional carbon dates led the
researchers to conclude that the terrace soil
dates were as much as a thousand years too
early (Mandel et al. 2007). Martin and Johnson
(1995) present a series of comparative dates
including dating of humic acid fraction versus
total bulk soil dates. Their data suggest that the
soil residue fraction, that part of the sample
left after humic acid was extracted for dating,
was typically older than either the humic acid
fraction or the total bulk sediment for most of
the alluvial contexts that they sampled, while
samples from older loess-derived soils do not
show such clear divergence.
Although Martin and Johnson (1995) attribute
some of the problems with differential dates to
soil age, it appears from their data that alluvial
soils behave somewhat differently in this
respect, and that the greatest spread between
humic acid and residual fraction dates might
be the deepest alluvial units, not necessarily
the oldest. Their widest gap, about 1,200 years
between the humic acid and residual fraction
172

dates, was recorded from a depth of 5.94–6.04
m at the Schoenenburg site on the Republican
River in south-central Nebraska (Martin
and Johnson 1995:234–235). The difference
between the fractions is less prominent in
shallower terrace deposits as in samples from
higher up at the Schoenenburg and Alma Vista
sites.
In bulk carbon samples from low-lying alluvial
deposits along the Neches River, Brown et
al. (n.d.) reported four paired dates from the
interface of the modern A and B horizons to
more than 2 mbs. All the residual fraction dates
were older than the paired humic acid fraction,
with the upper date less than a century older
and the lower ones about four hundred years
older. This depth-correlated discrepancy may
be due to a combination of rapid burial of
lower surfaces (as sedimentation slows as the
height of the terrace grows and burial becomes
increasingly slower at higher levels) and the
incorporation of older carbon from nearby
uplands floated in with flood deposits. Rapid
burial could lessen the quantity of pedogenic
carbon incorporated into the soil profile, thus
overly emphasizing the depositional carbon
and making the date seem much older than
expected. The data from Applewhite and
Martin and Johnson (1995) suggest that the
deepest terrace deposits at the Vara Daniel
could be as much as 500–1,500 years younger
than dated, though at this point no evidence is
available to verify what, if any, deviation might
be represented in the bulk sediment dates.
While some of the individual dates at the Vara
Daniel Site do seem problematic, the overall
trends and general periods represented seem
reasonable at first glance. Attempts to estimate
the date using linear regression yielded values
that were skewed at both ends of the continuum,
suggesting that the straight interpolation
provided the best method. A multiple linear
regression using the interpolated date and the
level depth shows a multiple R value of 0.97
with coefficients significant at the p = 0.05
level. Using the interpolated dates allows a
degree of chronological control over potential

trends in oxygen and carbon isotope variability.
Most importantly, it allows comparison with
trends in other proxy indicators of climate from
local and global sites. Problems with the bulk
sediment dates, as noted above, could shift the
chronological framework slightly, complicating
precise correlations with other data, but some
trends should be identifiable.
Finally, the earliest projected dates for the
alluvial terrace development at Vara Daniel
seems to fit well with the reconstruction
of Late Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial
environments in Central Texas presented in
Blum et al. (1994). They suggest that the period
between 14,000 and 11,000 years ago saw the
abandonment of earlier alluvial
fills, widespread downcutting, and
little deposition, with valley fills
resuming subsequent to 11,000 BP.
They also note increased seasonality
and greater effective moisture in this
post–11,000-year period as modern
climates began to dominate inland
portions of Central Texas.
Figure 12-1 shows a plot of the δ18O
values for both A. plicata and Q.
houstonensis by estimated age. The
graph shows a strong relationship
between the δ18O values of the two
species, with near parallel values in
their overlap with the exception of
the data between about 350 and 420
cmbs. In particular, parallel values
at 310, 320, 330, and 430 cmbs
suggest a close relationship between
the two species. In general, while
the deviations might indicate habitat
preferences between the clams that
might reflect a slightly different
hydrologic or isotopic regime, it is
just as likely that these are due to
normal fluctuations from the small
sample sizes (especially since
the upper level matches represent
relatively better sample sizes while
many of the wider deviations are the
result of very small samples).

The incorporation of 18O into freshwater
mussel shells is largely dependent on water
temperature, which is in turn dependent in part
on air temperature, humidity, stream flow, the
isotopic content of meteoric water, and the mix
and isotopic values of spring flow. Heavier 18O
isotopes tend to drop out with strong rainfall
closer to the coast, leaving isotopically lighter
(i.e., more negative δ18O) oxygen. Conversely,
cooler temperatures lower evapotranspiration
and can increase the fraction of heavy oxygen
(less negative values). These simple variables
would suggest that mussels from 330 cmbs
and perhaps 360 and 420 cmbs represent brief
periods of cooler temperatures. Conversely,
extreme low values at 400 and 440 cmbs

and Q. houstonensis by estimated age.
173

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

suggest warmer and/or wetter periods. One
other factor that must be taken into account in
the analysis of oxygen isotope trends, however,
is the different sources of Colorado River and
Barton Creek waters. These hydrologically and
geologically different stream basins are very
likely to have quite different δ18O values at any
given time and may respond slightly differently
to shifting climatic parameters.
While no pre-dam data are available for the
isotopic content of the Colorado River and
Barton Creek in the Austin area, it seems
possible that the shorter, largely spring-fed
Barton Creek could have values more heavily
influenced by groundwaters that tend to be
more negative in this general area
(compare the δ18O value of -3.58‰
measured for the South Fork of
Rocky Creek near Briggs; Coplen
and Kendall 2000). Thus, the
extreme low values could reflect
clams from Barton Creek rather
than the Colorado River. In general,
the slightly greater variability in the
data values could be in part due to
mixing throughout the section of
shells from both drainages (perhaps
further complicated by non-cultural
shells and/or those that might have
washed in during severe flood
events).
Values for δ13C are plotted in Figure
12-2 which, like Figure 12-1,
presents separate plots for A. plicata
and Q. houstonensis by estimated
age. At first glance, there seems
little relationship between the δ13C
values for these two species. In fact,
while the δ13C means for the two
species (-6.3‰ for Q. houstonensis
and -6.09‰ for A. plicata) are
relatively similar, the individual
data points are relatively divergent.
With the exception of the values at
400 cmbs, already suggested above
as potentially reflecting a warmer,
wetter environment or a dominance
174

of Barton Creek waters, none are greater than
1‰. Interpretation of δ13C values in aquatic
molluscs is complicated and somewhat
controversial. Most of the carbon incorporated
into freshwater mussel shell seems to be in
equilibrium with the stream DIC, though some
may come as a result of diet and/or respiration
(Doctor et al. 2008; Geist et al. 2005, 2006;
McConnaughey and Gillikin 2008; Schöne
et al. 2006). Barton Creek and the Colorado
River likely had very different DIC values in
the prehistoric era, although modern values,
influenced by planted landscapes, development,
and dams, are of little relevance. Still, divergent
carbon values could also signal mussels from
the different streams.

and Q. houstonensis by estimated age.

As with other riverine samples from Texas,
there is essentially no correlation between
the δ18O and δ13C values, with an r-value of
-0.03 for all individual samples. The spread
of coefficients suggests that the δ18O and δ13C
values are independent variables that are not
directly interrelated to one another and likely
reflect different aspects of shell construction
(Figure 12-3). Although both isotopic values
represent aspects of the environment within
which the molluscs secreted their shells, δ18O
values tend to reflect water temperature, and
thus indirectly other environmental variables
such as ambient temperature, stream flow, and
evapotranspiration while δ13C values reflect a
complex mix of metabolic and dietary factors.

Despite the relative independence of these two
variables, all of the Texas studies have shown a
slight negative relationship.
Whatever the source of the δ13C, the isotope
data plot seems to show a certain degree of
direct environmental variation. Comparisons
of the carbon isotopic profiles with δ13C from
the radiocarbon analyses and from Frederick’s
geomorphology (see Chapter 6) suggest some
close matches along the curve, while other
points are widely divergent. Thus, while some
of the carbon may represent high C4 (see
Nordt et al. 2002), most show only minimal
evidence of paralleling the C3-C4-CAM series.
Presumably the remainder of the δ13C curve
is not related to the local C3-C4
vegetation continuum, and is rather
derived from DIC influenced by
groundwater or upstream flows,
respiration, or diet. Freshwater
mussels are filter feeders and their
diet includes diatoms, desmids,
algae, and possibly detritus,
phytoplankton, and nutrients in
solution (Howells et al. 1996:17).

12.4	Paleoclimatic
Implications
Since Urey’s early studies of δ18O
variability demonstrated a direct
relationship between marine shell
isotopic fractionation and water
temperature, numerous studies
have tried to reconstruct climatic
parameters throughout the geologic
past. The most successful attempts
have developed the relationship
between shell carbonate δ18O, water
δ18O, and water temperature where
shell carbonate values are known,
while both past temperature and
past water δ18O are unknowns.

For reconstructions of ocean
paleotemperatures from marine
shell carbonates, it has been
175

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

possible to make certain assumptions about the
isotopic composition of past oceans, although
some assumptions, such as the isotopic stability
of ancient oceans, have been questioned. Even
such tenuous assumptions of stability are rarely
possible, however, given the widely fluctuating
δ18O of continental waters, where there are wide
ranges in individual storm events, short-term,
seasonal, and annual variation in the isotopic
values of δ18O given changes in the amount of
precipitation, temperature, and local conditions
of evaporation.
Dettman
and
Lohman
(1993:157–
160) identified three primary types of
paleotemperature regimes in their attempt to
reconstruct Paleogene climates: 1) temperaturedominated environments with constant δ18O
water, 2) temperature-dominated environments
with variable δ18O water, and 3) environments
dominated by seasonally variable δ18O water.
While these models neatly describe the primary
processes in isotopic fractionation, they may
not be mutually exclusive, nor so clearly
separable in all cases. And unfortunately,
shifting global climatic patterns could easily
alter the basic pattern of any region, making
the precise reconstruction of paleotemperatures
impossible.
The modern Texas data suggest a temperaturedominated environment with variable δ18O
of water. Studies indicate that δ18Oshell values
vary inversely with δ18Owater around a mean
temperature estimated by Grossman and Ku
(1986) at approximately 20.6ºC, just a few
tenths of a degree higher than the annual
mean air temperature for Austin. At that
temperature, δ18Oshell equals δ18Owater with a
small remainder about 0.2–0.3‰ that accounts
for the fractionation between water and
aragonite, the primary carbonate structure
of many unionids. For temperatures above
20.6ºC, δ18Oshell values decrease while lower
air temperatures result in correspondingly
higher δ18Oshell values. Despite wide seasonal
temperature variation in Austin, the mean
annual δ18Oshell value should still remain close
to the annual mean of δ18Owater. This average is
176

complicated, however, by restricted growth and
even cessation during temperature extremes
and a tendency to produce less carbonate shell
material with age. A well-documented winter
hiatus in shell growth, typical when water
temperatures fall below 10–12ºC, is common in
northern latitudes and likely in northern Texas,
but may or may not occur in the Austin area
or latitudes farther south (Howells, personal
communication, 2003). With many freshwater
shells, the annual growth is considered to reflect
the spring through fall environment, though
high summer temperatures throughout much
of Texas are thought to limit summer growth,
perhaps ceasing altogether above a certain
water temperature (Howells 1997, personal
communication, 2003).
If one were to project a similar isotopic regime
into the past, and assume that variation in
δ18Oshell values were due to greater variation in
temperature rather than variation in isotopic
composition, it should be possible to construct
a crude temperature reconstruction from
the available data. In a previous analysis of
oxygen isotopes from mussel shell carbonates
collected from the Applewhite area in
southern Bexar County, δ18Owater and δ18Oshell
values were estimated from modern regional
values and hypothetical reconstructions were
derived (Brown 2007). These values were
used to generate temperature reconstructions
for the various sample points in the deep
alluvial profile at the Beene site, a profile that
encompasses much of the Middle Holocene.
Taking the modern San Antonio mean annual
air temperature (about 20.6ºC) as the baseline,
most of the estimated paleotemperatures from
the site are about 1–2ºC warmer than the
present air temperature. The warmest, at 2.3ºC
higher than the modern mean, was from the
Upper Perez group of samples (dated to about
8800–8600 BP), with the slightly later Elm
Creek (8500–7500 BP) not far behind at 2.1ºC
warmer. The most surprising value was from
the Lower Leon Creek period (4600–4100 BP),
which yielded an amazing 6.5ºC cooler than
today, or about the modern annual average for
Amarillo, correlating with a cooler interval
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

noted after 5000 BP by both Nordt et al. (2002)
and Bousman (1998). To what degree the
estimated paleotemperature can be taken as a
true indicator of the precise extent of a possible
climate shift is not clear, but the eight shells
from the Lower Leon Creek sample were from
the same cultural feature and had the least
variation of any group of shells from the site.

In looking at the detail of the paleotemperature
reconstructions, it is important to remember
this is a crude estimate based on several
assumptions and other proxy data. Much of
these data were drawn from the Applewhite
and San Antonio area, but in the critical
parameters of temperature, precipitation,
evapotranspiration, and distance from the
coast, both areas are very similar. If anything,
one might expect that the δ18O values from
Austin, a tiny bit farther from the coast than
San Antonio, would be slightly more negative.
Instead, the overall average of grouped values
from the Vara Daniel Site is about 0.7‰ greater
than the Richard Beene site values, about
2.8ºC cooler for the Zilker Park site, much
more likely to be influenced by the period than
the latitude. Unfortunately, no good isotopic
comparative data were found for the Colorado
River near Austin and the only published
values, from the South Fork of Rocky Creek
near Briggs (Coplen and Kendall 2000), are
significantly more negative than those from
either Austin or San Antonio and, given the
different hydrologic regimes, are not likely to
be valid. In any case, use of those values would
yield significantly cooler temperatures at Vara
Daniel. Instead, we assume the difference is
largely in the broader time spans. While the
Applewhite data span a slightly greater period

For a variety of reasons, it is impossible
to derive precise local coefficients for the
Grossman and Ku model noted above.
Neither the Colorado River nor Barton Creek
has a natural flow today, water temperature
measurements are spotty and largely reflect
impounded water conditions, and isotope data
are rare to non-existent, making estimation
of these parameters imprecise at best. A
potentially severe complicating factor is the
likely difference between Barton Creek and
the Colorado River; mussels from these two
adjacent streams could have very different
isotope values that would be difficult to
separate out in any analysis. Nonetheless,
given these problems in estimating precise
paleotemperatures, it should be possible to
specify the rough patterns present in the data.
If we assume that the hydrological conditions
at Austin are similar to those south of San
Antonio (not unreasonable since both Austin
and San Antonio have an average
annual air temperature of 20.3ºC,
or 68.6ºF), then preliminary
paleotemperature
predictions
indicate that the mean for the
17 grouped samples is about
2.2ºC (3.7ºF) cooler than today
(Figure 12-4). Only one of the 17
samples, at around 10,400 BP,
suggested warmer temperatures
than today. Four of the 16 cooler
estimates were within 1ºF of the
modern mean, and five more
were within 3ºF of that mean.
Three samples were more than
8ºF cooler. The coldest estimate,
around 57ºF, is just warmer
that the average annual air

of time, most of the samples are from the
Middle Holocene, the warmest period overall,
and it is hardly surprising that the earlier period
is several degrees cooler.
Finally, how do these isotope values from
the Vara Daniel Site correlate with previous
climate models? Figure 12-5 shows the
relationship between the δ18Oshell values at Vara
Daniel (altered by a constant for comparison
purposes) with data from the δ18Owater isotope
sequence from the GISP2, the latter sampled at
one-century intervals to roughly approximate
the data spread from the Zilker Park project.
While the charts are hardly identical, there are
numerous correspondences in slope and value
range. In fact, the values line up better at this
point in the GISP2 curve than any other, and it
would seem at first glance that the interpolated
conventional 14C dates are closer to the counted
years of the ice core if this interpretation
is correct. This certainly suggests that the
calibrated 14C dates, which do not offer any
obvious correspondence between the data sets,
would be 1,000–2,000 years too old.
In general, the values do represent ancient
hydrological conditions in the Colorado River
and adjacent sections of Barton Creek, most
importantly water temperatures, and δ18O of the
stream waters. Cooler water temperatures, and

thus correspondingly cooler air temperatures,
are represented by the positive peaks, while the
negative peaks represent warmer waters and air
temps. The 41 shells in the analysis sample a
period of time of less than 6,500 years; thus,
each shell is a “proxy” for about 160 years.
Since the shells probably live only 15–40 years
for the most part, this leaves the period sampled
at only a 10–20 percent level if we assume
there is no overlap in the periods covered by
each shell (actually highly improbable given
the nature of the data—some of the shells are
likely to incorporate some overlap in coverage,
further reducing the actual sampling period).
Because the sampling method averages the
δ18O of years of individual growth periods,
the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variation
is severely damped. Presumably most 15 to
40-year periods out of the last 12,000 years
would have included a mix of wet and drier as
well as cooler and warmer years. Under this
scenario, most of the isotopic history of many
of the shells would be dampened somewhat,
with normal variations canceling each other
out and uniquely cold or warm years lost in the
multi-year average. Only multi-year/decadal
droughts, cold spells, hydrologic shifts, and
other such longer-term events would separate
out the true extremes. These peaks in the charts
should represent a dramatic clustering of warm
or cool year δ18O in the shell.

Daniel with δ18O water values from GISP2 data.

Both δ18O and δ13C values
have been examined in shell
carbonate derived from samples
collected from excavations at
the Vara Daniel Site in Zilker
Park. As seen in previous
studies, the δ13C values are very
difficult to interpret, though they
do show some relationships to
δ13C values from radiocarbon
and soil carbon analyses. While
the behavior of carbon isotopes
in mussel shell construction is
still poorly understood, these

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

occasional parallel values both seem to reflect
the δ13C values of the local plant community,
which further suggests that the mussels are
using organic carbon washed in from areas
adjacent to the stream. At other points where
the congruence is less obvious, stream DIC,
aerial CO2, and mussel diet may have played a
greater role in setting the shell δ13C values. In
general, the δ18Oshell values at the Vara Daniel
Site are significantly more positive and do not
show the extreme range of soil and radiocarbon
δ13C.
The δ18O values of shell carbonate derived from
the prehistoric samples at the Vara Daniel Site
document frequent cyclical variation in water/
air temperatures during the Middle and Early
Holocene. These cycles suggest temperature
ranges from less than 1ºF warmer than the
present to nearly 12ºF cooler, much cooler
temperatures than are seen in previous Late and
Middle Holocene samples from South, Central,
and North Central Texas. Unfortunately, these
cooler temps do not automatically correlate
with wetter periods. In fact, wet cycles tend
to feature highly depleted and thus have very
negative δ18O values that could be interpreted
as warmer temperatures.
Unlike
the
mussel
shell
derived
paleotemperature estimates from the Richard
Beene site, the requisite parameters are
not available at this time to develop a true
numerical estimate (those derived for the
Beene site are in themselves gross estimates
at best). A more thorough search might find
appropriate proxies to use for Austin, but
the modern water component is problematic
since both streams are impounded in this
area and δ18Owatervalues are not likely to be
representative of naturally flowing streams.
Likewise, while many native mussels are
being extirpated from Texas rivers, radical
changes in atmospheric carbon and in stream
flow are greater obstacles to deriving useful
comparative values. Nonetheless, a larger and
better-controlled study combined with selected
modern water samples and other proxies just
might permit a more precise reconstruction.

Microsampling of well-dated specimens might
provide clues to seasonality of rainfall and
other parameters that are difficult to measure
through the coarse averaging process used
here, possibly allowing a much more detailed
paleoclimatic reconstruction.
Summarizing the evidence that has been
gleaned from the δ18O analysis, it would appear
that just over half of the data points (9 of 17) fall
within a 2ºF (1.1ºC) range, roughly estimated at
64–66ºF and equivalent to the modern annual
average from Waco north to about Denton (i.e.,
100–200 miles north of Austin). Average annual
temperatures closer to normal are projected for
five data points, ranging from about 68 to just
over 69ºF. These high projections are spread
across the period of excavations at Vara Daniel,
from the highest mussel shell sample point at
275 cmbs (interpolated date 8171 BP) to the
lowest at 495 cmbs (10,905 BP). Other warm
spikes were recorded at 345, 365 and 435
cmbs (interpolated at 9498, 9634, and 10395
BP). The warmest projected annual average air
temperature was 69.4ºF, close to the modern
value for Pleasanton, about 30 miles south of
San Antonio.
Significantly cooler temperatures are thought
to have prevailed at three data points, 325,
355, and 415 cmbs (9230, 9566, and 9840
BP). These extremes ranged from an estimated
61ºF at 9566 BP to 57.5ºF at 9840 BP, average
annual temperatures seen today from central
Oklahoma to central Kansas. In terms of the
analytical units defined for lithic artifact studies
elsewhere in this report, the middle unit, AU
2, appears to be the warmest of the three,
projected to be about 66ºF, still several degrees
cooler than the average temperature in modern
Austin. Both AU 1 and AU 3 are cooler, the
former projected at 64.2ºF and the latter at
64.0ºF, close to the modern average for Waco.
Overall, projected temperatures above 320
cmbs are warmer (averaging 66.1ºF) and show
a relatively narrow range of extremes (between
64.5 and 68.4ºF), while the subsequent period
is not only slightly cooler (averaging 64.6ºF),

179

Chapter 12 Paleoclimatic Implications of Isotopic Composition of Freshwater Mussel Shell

but also shows greater extremes (between 57.5
and 69.4ºF).
Comparing these data to other paleoclimatic
interpretations, the assertion by Nordt et
al. (2002) that the period between 11,000
and 10,000 14C BP features increased C4
productivity and warmer temperatures seems
to agree with the Vara Daniel data that show
this period among the warmest, averaging
66.6ºF. Similar conclusions were drawn for
this time by Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and
Holliday (2000) for North-Central Texas and
the Southern Plains. Similar correspondences
are lacking for the subsequent millennia. Nordt
and his colleagues suggest only slightly less
C4 production in the following millennium,
a period markedly cooler in the Vara Daniel
Site data, averaging 63.8ºF. The most recent
millennium covered by the Vara Daniel Site
data, between 8,000 and 9,000 BP, at 66.1ºF,
is only slightly cooler than the oldest and more
than two degrees cooler than the previous
period.
Looking
at
broader
paleoclimatic
reconstructions, Toomey et al. (1993) suggest
wetter conditions between about 8000 and
10,000 BP, and increasing dryness thereafter
based on the variable co-occurrence of
Cryptotis and Notiosorex shrews at Hall’s
Cave in Kerr County. Bousman (1998), in his
reassessment of pollen data from Central Texas
bogs, notes the dominance of arboreal pollen at
Boriack Bog in Lee County, with pronounced
decreases (and corresponding increases in grass
pollen) at around 9100, 10,200, and 10,600
BP. Not quite parallel, the lowest grass pollen
(Poaceae) during this period occurs around

180

9300 BP, while the highest grass peaks do
correspond to the arboreal decreases at 10,200,
and 10,600 BP. The latter might relate to the
highest projected temperature in the present
study at around 10,395 BP, while the grass
peak could correlate with the younger of two
extreme low projected temperatures at around
9230 BP. Note also that he shows a series of
extreme swings in the overall pollen percent
graph between 9000 and 10,000 BP, while most
of the subsequent millennium is a relatively flat
plateau with moderately high arboreal pollen.
Given the relatively limited stable isotope
sample size and the issues with bulk sample
dating, these correlations are vague generalities
at best and strict comparisons are not warranted
at this point. Nonetheless, there are some
notable differences between the defined
analytical units as well as a number of shortterm episodes of high and low temperatures
that could have affected flora, fauna, and even
local hydrologic conditions. Without a large
faunal collection or extensive tool debris that
could yield evidence of shifts in function, it
might be difficult to see such short-term shifts
in a single site, especially one located in a
presumably buffered streamside environment.
Still, while the coolest intervals seem to show
some occupation at the site, more intensive
occupations may have occurred during climatic
regimes closer to those of today. Conversely,
the warmest projected temperature, recorded
at about 435 cmbs (about 10,395 years ago),
seems to correlate with dramatically decreasing
density of cultural materials at the site.
Subsequent projected high-temperature points
also seem to co-occur with low densities of
cultural materials.

Ostracode Shells
By Mervin Kontrovitz

13.1	Introduction

13.2	Material and Methods

Ostracodes are aquatic, bivalved crustaceans
with mostly microscopic calcium carbonate
shells (calcite) that are commonly preserved
in ancient sediments. They are found in the
oceans, estuaries, and in freshwater bodies
along coasts and inland. Modern freshwater
ostracodes occur in rivers, streams, ponds,
lakes, and canals, indeed, in most surface and
interstitial waters.

Material for this study was collected from
excavation of Unit 15 (see Figure 5-18).
Nineteen sediment samples were supplied by
EComm; each represented a 10-cm interval
beginning at 300–310 cmbs to a depth of
480–490 cmbs. This study examined only
every-other 10-cm interval, beginning at the
300–310-cmbs interval.

Different ostracode taxa may inhabit distinct
environments and are therefore useful in
interpreting ecological factors from old
sediments, as are many other invertebrates.
They have proven valuable in reconstructing
the environmental history of their containing
sediment because they are sensitive to
temperature, turbidity, salinity, other dissolved
materials, and water depth. Many of these
factors are known for modern forms and
their tolerances allow for an interpretation of
environments as recorded in sediment from
natural and artificial waters bodies (Benson
1961; Delorme 1971; Kaesler 1983; Kontrovitz
and Griffiths 2009; Kontrovitz and Henry
2005).

About 750 cc from each sample were soaked
in tap water for 24 hours at the University of
Louisiana at Monroe (ULM), and then gently
washed with tap water on a US Standard 120
mesh sieve. ULM tap water has been shown to
be harmless to the calcite shells. No phosphates
or other chemicals were used to disperse or
otherwise deflocculate the material because
such reagents may damage calcium carbonate
shells (Kontrovitz et al. 1991). The sediment
from each sample was then air dried and sieved
with the following US Standard meshes: 20,
40, 60, 80, and 120. Each size fraction for each
sample was scanned for ostracodes, which
then were removed and placed on standard
micropaleontology slides for identification
(Jones 1956).

Wet, or once wet, archaeological sites may have
been ideal habitats for ostracodes (Kontrovitz
and Henry 2005; Kontrovitz and Snyder 2008).
Even if a site was not continuously wet, the
ostracode shells may still have been preserved
in the aquatic portions of the sediment.
Furthermore, the ostracodes might be used to
reveal the wet and dry episodes.

Ostracode remains were removed from
the dried sediments by the standard
micropaleontological technique referred to
as picking, a well-established and standard
practice (Jones 1956). A portion of each dried
sample was sprinkled on a small black-colored
tray so there were no overlapping grains. A
00-sized artist’s brush was wetted and touched

elliptica, both found in each of the 10 samples,

from only one sample (380–390 cmbs). The
other six species were limited to two to five
occurrences throughout the 190-cm sediment
column (Table 13-2).

to a shell; the shell adhered to the brush and was
transferred to a paper micropaleontology slide.
This was repeated until all of the sediment was
examined and all of the shells were removed
from each fraction.
All species were identified using the pertinent
literature on modern freshwater forms. From
that literature, the modern environmental
ranges of each taxon were ascertained, then
used to interpret the environment represented
from each sample from the site (see literature
citations below).

Only 123 ostracode valves were recovered
from all of the 10 samples of about 750 cc
each. Such a recovery rate is remarkably low.
Hundreds or even thousands of shells are
commonly seen elsewhere in samples only
one-tenth of that size. The following discussion
summarizes the data for environmental factors
for ostracode species recovered at the Vara
Daniel Site (41TV1364).

13.3	Results
Shells of nine extant species of ostracodes,
representing eight genera, were recovered
from the sediment samples (Table 13-1).
Additionally, several reworked marine
Cretaceous specimens were seen, but those
are not relevant to the present study.

Most of the extant species were unevenly
distributed in the 190-cm vertical array

species at a single level (400–410 cmbs)
was seven and the minimum number (at
480–490 cmbs and at 300–310 cmbs) was
two. The most commonly occurring species

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Candona elliptica Furtos, 1933, present here in
each of the 10 levels, was originally described
from shallow and weed-filled inlets off of
southern Lake Erie in Ohio. It was later reported
from the southwestern portion of the Canadian
Prairies, and a subspecies was recovered
in modern lakes of Ohio, Massachusetts,
Tennessee, and Michigan. Apparently, it rarely
occurs in deep or cold waters, but was found
in shallow waters in Holarctic and Neotropical
regions, including temporary and permanent
ponds and marshes of Ohio (Smith 1987).
Kitchell and Clark (1979) suggest that it was
recovered from water depths of about 1.5 to 24
m. In its range, the species is commonly found
in substrates of gyttja, sand, and fine gravel.
Overall, C. elliptica occupies a temperature
range of 10.5–21°C (Delorme 1970a; Forester
et al. 2005; Furtos 1933; Kitchell and Clark
1979; Kontrovitz and Griffiths 2009; PalaciosFest 2007; Smith 1987; Staplin 1963a).
Candona patzcuaro Tressler, 1954, has as
its type locality Lago de Patzcuaro, State of
Michoacan, Mexico, where it was recovered
by dredging at a depth of 4 m. Elsewhere, it is
reported from environments where the salinities
are in the range up to 5 parts per thousand (ppt)
with mean annual temperatures (MAT) from
13 to 32°C (Forester et al. 2005; Palacios-Fest
2007; Tressler 1954).
Cypridopsis vidua (O. F. Müller, 1776) has
been reported from a wide range of habitats
in almost every type of freshwater habitat,
including interstitial waters, ranging in age
from Pleistocene to modern. The species is a
swimmer, most abundant in permanent and
temporary still waters where there are aquatic
plants. It can tolerate slow currents if plants and/
or algae are present. C. vidua has been reported
from Holarctic and Neotropical regions where
temperatures are within the range of about
11–32°C, but Palacios-Fest (1989) indicated it
must have at least one month with the average
temperatures above 20°C to complete its life
cycle. Salinity values in waters supporting this
species range up to about 8 ppt (Curry 1999;

Ecological Communications Corporation

Furtos 1933; Meisch 2000; Palacios-Fest
1989, 2007; Sharpe 1897; Smith 1987; Staplin
1963b).
Darwinula stevensoni (Brady and Robertson,
1870) was recorded by Furtos (1933) from
its occurrences from several lakes in Ohio. In
Europe it prefers fishponds, lakes, and slow
streams, where it can tolerate salinities up to
a maximum of 15 ppt. It is also common in
wet, interstitial environments. Occurring over
a wide range of temperatures, it can tolerate
cool temperatures, as revealed by its presence
in water bodies of boreal forests of Canada’s
interior plains and in glacial and interglacial
deposits (Delorme 1970b; Kitchell and Clark
1979; Meisch 2000). Elsewhere, Palacios-Fest
(2007) suggested its overall temperature range
is 13–32°C. It is common with substrates of
sand, fine gravel, or gyttja, all where vegetation
is abundant and currents are slow or absent
(Kitchell and Clark 1979; Smith 1987).
Heterocypris antilliensis Broodbakker, 1982,
was represented in each of the 10 sediment
samples included in this study. The species
in this genus have been reported from
springs, seeps, and bodies of water receiving
groundwater discharge. Forester et al. (2005)
list H. antilliensis from a site in northeast Texas
and another in nearby northwestern Louisiana
with mean annual temperatures in the range of
18.7–18.9°C.
Limnocythere ornata Furtos, 1933, was
described from a cool, weedy inlet of Lake
Erie, where it was rare. Forester et al. (2005)
recorded the species from a site in northeast
Texas and another in nearby northwestern
Louisiana with mean annual temperatures of
18.1–18.7°C.
Limnocythere sp. was represented by two large
fragments that displayed sufficient characters,
including the central muscle scars, for
generic identification. The genus is common
in freshwater environments with some
occurrences reported from brackish waters.

183

Chapter 13 Ostracode Shells

Physocypria
pustulosa
(Sharpe
1897)
commonly occurs in the Great Lakes region,
but is uncommon south and west of that region.
The species is a swimmer and abundant in
lakes and pools where there are shallow, weedy
habitats. It lives among the plants and prefers
quiet water, but can tolerate slow currents. The
reported overall temperature range is 10.3–
21°C (Curry 1999; Forester et al. 2005; Smith
1987).
Potamocypris smaragdina (Vavra 1891),
described in Europe, is a swimmer and occurs
in North America from Canada to Mexico.
It is common at shallow depths (< 24 m) in
permanent lakes, ponds, and slow streams with
abundant aquatic plants on gyttja or sandy
substrates. P. smaragdina is a summer form
within the temperature range of about 10–32°C
(Forester et al. 2005; Meisch 2000; PalaciosFest 2007).
It should be noted that even in a sample
representing a 10-cm interval there is the
possibility that the environment changed over
the course of that accumulation, i.e., each
sample may represent time-averaging. There
no way to speculate further on that possibility
without knowing the rate(s) of deposition.
Presumably, the material that makes up the
sediment represents the original substrate,
although reports in the literature indicate a
variety of other kinds of substrates are tolerated
by several of the species. Other environmental
factors for the taxa are derived from previous
studies, and the results for each level are
presented in stratigraphic order, that is, oldest
to youngest (deepest to least deep).
The deepest sample (480–490 cmbs) contained
only a total of four ostracode valves from
three species: Candona elliptica, Cypridopsis
vidua, and Heterocypris antilliensis. The
MAT suggested by these taxa is in the range
of 18–21°C. The aquatic environment would
have been shallow, no more than a few meters
in depth, with freshwater and abundant

184

vegetation. Currents, if any, would have limited
to low velocities.
Remains of four species occurred from 460
to 470 cmbs at the site. They are: Candona
elliptica, Candona patzcuaro, Heterocypris
antilliensis, and Physocypria pustulosa. The
meager remains (seven valves) taken together,
are indicative of an MAT of about 18–21°C.
Water depths were probably shallow, that is,
a few meters, while salinity was in the limnic
range (up to 0.5 ppt). The environment may
well have supported abundant vegetation and
algae.
The next higher sediment level (440–450
cmbs) yielded a total of seven valves of:
Candona elliptica, Heterocypris antilliensis,
Physocypria pustulosa, and Potamocypris
smaragdina. These species, combined, suggest
an environment similar to the lower samples.
The MAT was 18–21°C; water was a few
meters deep and fresh (limnic); there were
probably abundant plants and/or algae; they
may have been slow currents or there may have
been none.
Sediment from 420 to 430 cmbs held 20 valves
of five species: Candona elliptica, Heterocypris
antilliensis, Limnocythere sp., Physocypria
pustulosa, and Potamocypris smaragdina.
MAT would have been 18–21°C and the water
shallow and fresh (< 0.5 ppt). Vegetation was
probably abundant in a low-energy environment
of still water or slow currents.
In the context of this study, the results for the
depth of 400–410 cmbs are remarkable. There
were seven ostracode species and a total of
23 valves. Present were: Candona elliptica,
Candona patzcuaro, Heterocypris antilliensis,
the first appearance of Limnocythere ornata,
Limnocythere sp., Physocypria pustulosa,
and Potamocypris smaragdina. Despite this
diversity, the environmental interpretation
is much like that for the other samples. That
is, the MAT was 18–21°C, the water depth
was shallow and limnic, and there appears to

have been much vegetation and perhaps slow
currents.
At a depth of 380 to 390 cmbs, the sediment
contained the remains of four species including
Candona elliptica, the only encounter
with Darwinula stevensoni, Heterocypris
antilliensis, and Limnocythere ornata. As with
the other samples, evidence indicates the MAT
was about 18–21°C. The water appears to have
been fresh, shallow, and supportive of abundant
vegetation in a regime that may have had slow
currents.
Candona elliptica, Heterocypris antilliensis,
and Physocypria pustulosa mark the material
from a depth of 360–370 cmbs. Only eight
valves were recovered from sediment that
appears to have originated in an environment
of shallow freshwater, with MAT of about
18–21 °C. There appears to have been abundant
vegetation, and possibly there were slow
currents.

limnic (fresh) with a depth no more than a
few meters. The nature of any accompanying
currents and vegetation cannot be ascertained
because previous references make no mention
of those factors for the species present.

13.4	Summary and
Conclusions
Nine species of podocopid ostracodes
representing eight genera were recovered
from 10 subsurface samples taken at the Vara
Daniel Site (41TV1464) in Zilker Park, Austin,
Texas. The taxa were unevenly distributed in
the vertical sequence of 190 cm. Recovery
from any one 10-cm interval ranged from four
to 23 valves representing two to seven species
(see Table 13-2). The total was 123 valves for
all samples, a remarkably low number when
compared to other ostracode numbers recovered
elsewhere from shallow-water sediments rich
in CaCO3.

The level from 340 to 350 cmbs had a total
of 14 valves from Candona elliptica and
Heterocypris antilliensis. Both species have
been reported within the temperature range
of 18–21°C, in shallow freshwater, and in
abundant vegetation.

The paucity of ostracode specimens in the Vara
Daniel material may result from one or more
possible reasons:

The next higher interval, 320–330 cmbs,
had four ostracode species; there were 22
valves in total from: Candona elliptica,
Cypridopsis vidua, Heterocypris antilliensis,
and Limnocythere ornata. The MAT range (18–
21°C) is similar to the lower levels, as were the
water depth (shallow) and salinity (fresh). The
presence of abundant vegetation was indicated
along with probability that water currents may
have been absent or slow.

2) Natural preservation was poor due to
some diagenetic factor(s).

Sediments from a depth of 300 to 310 cmbs
yielded a total of 10 valves from three
species, namely, Candona elliptica, Candona
patzcuaro, and Heterocypris antilliensis. The
temperature is thus interpreted as having been
in the range of 18–21°C, while the water was

1) Original productivity for ostracodes
was low.

3) The recovery techniques and handling
were improper.
Explanation 1 cannot be tested at this time.
Explanation 2 seems not to apply because
the containing sediment has a high calcium
carbonate content that is conducive to
ostracode
preservation.
Furthermore,
even delicate shells, such as those of
Cypridopsis vidua, Physocypria pustulosa,
and Potamocypris smaragdina, are present
in nearly perfect condition. Explanation 3 is
not plausible in that the techniques are long
established and have yielded large numbers of
specimens at many sites for many researchers.

185

Chapter 13 Ostracode Shells

Based upon ostracode remains, there appears
to have been little or no measurable variation
in the environment at the site over the time
represented by the sediment samples. The
MATs, based upon mutual overlap, were in
the range of 18–21°C, much like today’s
MAT (Climate-Zone.com 2009; Owenby et
al. 2009), although some of the species are
known to tolerate a great range. Regardless of
the differences in species composition between
some of the 10 assemblages, the summaries of
environmental conditions for each level are the
same.
The water depths were shallow, probably just
a few meters. Unfortunately, there are few
quantitative data given in previous literature
for the relevant species, with the terms littoral
or shallow most commonly used. In the case of
the species in present study, only Kitchell and
Clarke (1979) present depth range in a truly
quantitative manner.
Salinity values were in the freshwater range
(limnic), which is less than 0.5 ppt total

186

dissolved salts (Meisch 2000). Certain species
in these samples can tolerate higher salinities,
but some cannot, thereby precluding any
another interpretation.
The depositional environments must have
included abundant vegetation and/or algae,
although remains of these are not widely
preserved in the material. Many of the species
are reported to require much vegetation,
especially the swimming forms that live on
and among plants. This is closely related their
ability to tolerate slow currents while preventing
themselves from being swept away. Certainly,
there is no evidence of rapid currents; none of
the species could tolerate such conditions.
Thus, taken together, the environmental
indicators reveal a stable environment with a
MAT of about 18–21°C, shallow freshwater;
still to slowly moving water, and abundant
vegetation. Ostracode remains reveal no
marked excursion by any of those factors over
the period of deposition at the Vara Daniel Site.

Diatom Paleoenvironmental Analysis
By Barbara Winsborough

14.1	Introduction
Diatoms are single-celled algae that have
a silica cell wall and are often preserved in
stream and pond sediments. They are the most
abundant and taxonomically diverse algal
group in streams and rivers and are critically
important to their ecology, as they stabilize
the substrate, convert inorganic nutrients into
organic forms useable by other organisms, and
provide food for much of the aquatic food web,
including fish and mollusks. Many diatoms are
cosmopolitan (found in various parts of the
world under similar ecological conditions) and
their autecological characteristics have been
well documented, particularly for the more
common species. Autecological indices use the
relative abundance of species in assemblages
and their ecological preferences, sensitivities,
and tolerances to infer specific or general
environmental conditions in an ecosystem
(Denys 1991; Lange-Bertalot 1979; Lowe and
Pan 1996; Porter 2008; Stevenson and Pan
1999; Van Dam et al. 1994). Important diatom
attributes include trophic state (the presence
of inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen,
phosphorus, silica, and carbon) and saprobity
(the presence of biodegradable organic matter
and low oxygen concentrations), salinity,
pH, nitrogen uptake metabolism, oxygen
requirements, moisture requirements, life forms
(attached, motile, etc.), and habitat preferences
including aerophilic (found primarily on wet
and damp soil and rock walls), epiphytic (on
plants), epilithic (on stones), epipelic (in mud),
epipsammic (on sand), and planktonic (in the
water column). Metaphyton, another distinct
habitat, are loose aggregates of benthic algae
that become detached from the substrate and
form dense, entangled, or floating masses.
Ecological Communications Corporation

The diatom attributes have been composited
into various community-level pollution metrics
called trophic diatom indices that provide
an indication of biotic integrity and human
disturbance (Bahls 1993; Fore 2003; Fore and
Grafe 2002; Kelly and Whitton 1995; LangeBertalot and Genkal 1999; Mills et al. 2002;
Muscio 2002; Porter et al. 2008; Potapova and
Charles 2007; Potapova et al. 2004; Wang et al.
2005). Data from the above-mentioned sources
were consulted in determining the diatombased paleoenvironmental interpretations for
the Vara Daniel Site. Special emphasis was put
on diatom autecological data that have been
derived for the Colorado River Basin at Austin
(Muscio 2002).
Diatoms provide Texas archaeologists with
information about water quality and aquatic
ecology of water sources associated with sites.
Changes in the composition of the diatom
assemblage over time, particularly during the
Late Quaternary, have been used to identify
drying of streams and deepening or shallowing
of lakes and water tables, a proxy for climate
variation. Particular diatom species and trends
in species richness have been used to recognize
degradation of water quality related to human
activities. Diatoms restricted to coastal marine
zones and their associated evaporitic lagoonal
habitats, found by the author in material from
several Central Texas sites, have the potential
of identifying seasonal Paleoindian migration
or salt trade routes. There is also the possibility
of using diatoms incorporated in the fabric of
sherds to identify the source of the clay used in
manufacture.

187

Chapter 14 Diatom Paleoenvironmental Analysis

The Vara Daniel Site is a deep, stratified
sequence of cultural deposits representing
repeated human occupations dating back
12,000 years, including Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Prehistoric archaeological periods (Collins
2009). The site is located on a floodplain of
the Colorado River in Travis County, Texas,
adjacent to where Barton Creek, a major
tributary, joins the Colorado River, and near
Barton Springs, one of the largest springs in
Texas. Prior to its impoundment, the Colorado
was a large, natural river that flowed about 966
km across Texas from Dawson County in the
Panhandle to Matagorda Bay in the Gulf of
Mexico (Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality 2004). Chert, granite, and limestone
gravels, sands, and clays deposited as flood
terraces carried with them diatoms from
diverse habitats and tributaries along the way.
The present study focuses on 10 sediment
samples from the oldest and most deeply
buried component of the site, dated between
about 5600 and 13,000 BP (see Chapter 7 and
Appendix E).

14.2	Methods
Samples were cleaned of organic material
and soluble salts with hydrogen peroxide and
hydrochloric acid, rinsed to neutrality, dried
onto 22 x 22-mm glass cover slips, and mounted
on permanent glass slides with Naphrax, a resin

with a contrasting refractive index. A complete
scan of four slides was done on each sample,
using an Olympus BH-2, at 1500x. Photos were
taken with a Nikon D80.

14.3	Results
Seven of the 10 sediment samples contained
diatoms or fragments of diatoms. The reason
that more diatoms were not found is because
the diatom remains were very much diluted
with sediment, as is typical of a fluvial deposit
associated with high flow conditions. Even so,
nine species and one genus of diatoms were
recognized among a total of 17 specimens,
including whole, complete frustules and partial
fragments that could only be identified as
pennate (generally benthic) or centric (often
planktonic) diatoms. These include Aulacoseira
cf.
granulata
(Ehrenberg)
Simonsen,
Aulacoseira sp., Caloneis bacillum (Grunow)
Cleve, Encyonema cf. delicatula Kützing,
Hantzschia amphioxys (Ehrenberg) Grunow,
Luticola mutica (Kützing) Mann, Navicula cf.
radiosa Kützing, Pinularia borealis Ehrenberg,
Surirella brébissonii Krammer and LangeBertalot, and Synedra ulna (Nitzsch) Ehrenberg.
Poor orientation and the fragmented condition
of some specimens precluded definitive
identifications. The diatoms found in each
sample are listed on Table 14-1 and illustrated
in Figures 14-1 though 14-13.

14.4	Discussion
The diatom assemblage at the Vara Daniel
Site represents a combination of diatoms
growing in damp soil or wet areas probably
associated with the site, and those transported
to the site during high-flow conditions. All
are considered cosmopolitan. By their very
nature, the sediments deposited during floods
on the Colorado River and Barton Creek
diluted the diatom cells they carried with
them, and combined diatoms from a variety of
aquatic and aerophilic habitats. Stream diatom
communities are constrained at the regional
level by physiography, climate, geology,
geochemistry, stream order, and land cover.
Because the Colorado River traverses four
ecoregions upstream of Austin, including the
Western High Plains, Central Great Plains,
Central Oklahoma/Texas Plains, and Edwards
Plateau (Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality 2004), the potential source area of
diatom material that could be transported
during high-flow conditions is diverse and far
reaching, dependent on the distance traveled
by the water. During the Early and Middle
Holocene, the diatom contribution in the upper
parts of the Colorado came from alkaline draws
and saline lakes that were more extensive
than at present (Meltzer 1991; Winsborough
1988, 1995). Further downstream from the
headwaters, the igneous Llano Uplift part of
the Edwards Plateau provided much of the
gravel deposited by the Colorado at Austin. A
network of limestone-rich perennial streams
on the Edwards Plateau and adjacent Balcones
Escarpment, including Barton Creek, were the
most local influences on aquatic ecology.
All of the diatom species encountered during
this investigation are common forms that
are found living in the Austin area today, so
they may not have been transported very far.
Aulacoseira granulata is typically part of
the phytoplankton in large lakes and rivers.
Caloneis bacillum, Hantzschia amphioxys,
Luticola mutica, and Pinnularia borealis are
primarily aerophilic diatoms. They could
have been washed into the water from damp
Ecological Communications Corporation

limestone banks during a flood, but they
probably grew in place on the flood terrace.
Luticola mutica was complete and showed no
evidence of transport, so it probably grew at the
site. Encyonema delicatula, Navicula radiosa,
Surirella brebissonii, and Synedra ulna are
aquatic, benthic species that could have come
from the Colorado River or Barton Creek, or
they could have been growing in shallow water
at the site. Autecological characteristics of each
of these species are summarized on Table 14-2.
This information was compiled from a variety
of sources that examined the relationship
of diatoms to water quality, including data
from the Austin area and the Colorado River
Basin. The diatom assemblage indicates that
throughout the interval represented by the
sediments, the water was clear, circumneutral
to alkaline in pH, well-aerated, did not contain
high concentrations of inorganic nutrients such
as nitrogen and phosphorous, and was not
polluted or degraded. It was only moderately
high in conductivity, and probably carbonate
rich. The water was more turbid during flood
events.
Missing from this assemblage are those benthic
diatoms that are often associated with drying,
hard water, and alkaline habitats commonly
associated with modern diatom assemblages
in Austin area streams, particular species in
the genera Denticula, Epithemia, Nitzschia,
and Rhopalodia. These diatoms are frequently
the most robust forms in the assemblage and
the ones most likely to be preserved. The
implication is that flow was more perennial
than today. The fragmentary condition of many
of the specimens could be a reflection of partial
dissolution or mechanical breakage due to the
vagaries of transport and the effects of grazing.

14.5	Conclusions
The autecological characteristics of the diatom
assemblage at the Vara Daniel Site provide
supportive information to paleobotanists and
paleontologists about the nature of the aquatic

paleoenvironment. Water quality and water
temperatures were essentially the same as they
are in similar modern habitats in the Austin
area. The presence of an aerophilic diatom
component at the site suggests that the soil
was wet or damp at least occasionally, as could
be expected from an overbank deposit. There
was only one planktonic diatom, probably
transported to the site during a flood; the rest
were benthic species, associated with microbial
194

mats in clear, shallow, vegetated, well-aerated,
carbonate-buffered, flowing water. The absence
of diatoms adapted to drying, osmotically
stressful conditions may mean that flow was
more perennial than it is in Barton Creek
today, and that locally there was less of the
excursion between flood and drought than that
which characterizes the present climate. The
diatom assemblage was too small to allow any
observations about climate variability.

Macrobotanical Remains
By Leslie L. Bush

15.1	Laboratory Methods
Flotation samples were processed a in a bucketto-bucket flotation system with light fraction
caught in 0.355-mm mesh and heavy fraction
mesh openings of 2.0 m, 1.0 mm, and 0.5
mm (see Appendix H). Seven samples were
submitted for analysis (Table 15-1). Flotation
samples were sorted according to standard
procedures at the Macrobotanical Analysis
Laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (Pearsall 2000).
For each sample, each heavy fraction size
class and each light fraction was examined
under a stereoscopic microscope at 7–45x
magnification for carbonized botanical remains,
faunal remains, and chert flakes. All carbonized
botanical remains, no matter how small, were
removed, counted, weighed, recorded, and
labeled. The single chert flake and a few tiny
bone fragments were also counted, weighed,
recorded, and labeled. Because there were so
few of them, uncarbonized seeds were treated
in the same fashion, even though they may
not represent ancient plants. Uncarbonized

rootlets, grass stems, and leaves were recorded
on a presence/absence basis on laboratory
forms. Materials were weighed on an Ohaus
Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance.
Botanical materials were identified to the
lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis
comparative collection and through the use
of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al.
1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and
Barkley 1961; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980).

15.2.1 Uncarbonized Plants
In all except the driest areas of North America,
uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites
can be assumed to be of modern origin unless
compelling evidence suggests otherwise
(Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek
1987:231). Although uncarbonized seeds are a

et al. 1997:337). Hackberry endocarps have
a high mineral content; they contain 40–70
percent aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium
carbonate that helps hackberry endocarps
preserve unusually well in the soil (Wang et
al. 1997; Yanovsky et al. 1932). In fact, Wang
and colleagues argue that dating of sediments
by hackberry inclusions is preferable to other
methods since the carbonates form over a single
growing season, their initial 14C content is the
same as that in the atmosphere, and they can be
tested for reliability before dating. (Wang et al.
1997:342).

common occurrence on most archaeological
sites, they usually represent seeds of modern
plants that have made their way into the soil
either through their own dispersal mechanisms
or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or
argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51–52; Miksicek
1987:231–232).
Uncarbonized seeds recovered from the Vara
Daniel Site are shown in Table 15-2 along
with rootlets, grass stems, and other modern
material noted in the flotation samples. The
uncarbonized plant remains at the Vara Daniel
Site consist largely of grass parts. The portion of
Zilker Park where excavations were conducted
is currently maintained by the City of Austin
as a grass lawn. These grasses most likely
represent plant parts that were incorporated into
flotation samples in the field. That small bits
of other modern material such as plastic also
became incorporated in the flotation samples
bolsters this interpretation. The legume seed, a
weedy specimen 2.5 mm in length, also likely
represents the modern flora.

Two species of hackberry are found in
Travis County today. Netleaf hackberry
(Celtis reticulata) is more common in mixed
woodlands on limestone slopes and in canyons.
Sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata) is a major
component of deciduous woodlands on
alluvial terraces such as the area near the Vara
Daniel Site. Sugar hackberry’s range extends
considerably north and east of Texas, making
it likely to have grown in Travis County
during the colder and more mesic conditions
of the early Holocene as well. The specimens
at the Vara Daniel Site are probably ancient,
but not necessarily archaeological in origin.

The hackberry seeds found in three of the
seven samples are more difficult to interpret.
Hackberry endocarps are surprisingly common
in geological and archaeological strata (Wang

argue for human use of the specimens, but all
hackberries recovered at the Vara Daniel Site
are uncarbonized.

15.2.2 Carbonized Plant Remains
Carbonized plant remains from the seven the
Vara Daniel Site samples consist of six wood
charcoal fragments and a botanical fragment
of indeterminable type (Table 15-3). The
wood charcoal fragments could be identified
as hardwoods by the predominance of fibers
and parenchyma (as opposed to tracheids,
which make up most softwood tissue). None
were large enough to identify to genus or
even botanical family. The largest wood
charcoal fragment, from Lot 1511 of Feature
3, measured 0.6 mm in maximum diameter.
Soil matrix was visible in the pores of this
specimen, suggesting it had been in the soil
for a long period. The same is true of the
indeterminable botanical fragment from
Feature 2. The wood charcoal fragments
from Feature 1 are suspiciously clean and
may represent contamination from a modern
source. One of the Feature 1 fragments
consists of a radial section of a hardwood;
the other is a longitudinal section of a vessel
element exhibiting alternate inter-vessel
pitting. The charcoal from Feature 3 Lot
1516 is poorly preserved. It should be noted
that all carbonized plant remains discussed
here fall below the 2-mm minimum threshold
used by archaeobotanists for enumerating and
identifying wood charcoal, nutshell, and many
other types of remains (Pearsall 2000).
Although charcoal itself is chemically stable
and has high preservation potential, the

absence or poor preservation of charcoal in
alkaline environments such as Herculaneum
and the River Aisne area of northern
France has long puzzled archaeologists
(Braadbaart et al. 2009). Recent experiments
have investigated the effects of alkaline
environments on charcoal (Braadbaart et al.
2009). The interactions between temperature
of carbonization, soil permeability, density,
and wood charcoal anatomy are complex. In
brief, however, chemically mediated changes
in macromolecular structure contribute to the
physical processes that cause fragmentation
of charcoal. Alkaline environments are an
important factor in the fragmentation of
charcoal (Braadbaart et al. 2009). The alkaline
soils and large numbers of shells in the soil
at the Vara Daniel Site explain why so little
charcoal is present on the site today. It almost
certainly does not reflect an absence of plant
use among site inhabitants during the early
Holocene.

15.3	Discussion
Although pollen evidence indicates the
existence of plant communities during the
Pleistocene that have no modern analogues,
modern plant communities seem to be good
analogues for Holocene environments when
allowances are made for fluctuations in moisture
and temperature (Bousman 1988:212). Pollen
profiles from Boriak, Hershop, and Patschke
bogs show large amounts of alder and birch
pollen giving way to oak pollens between
10,000 BP (Hershop) and 8000 BP (Boriak)
(Bousman 1998; Larson et al. 1972; Potzger
and Tharp 1947).

Chapter 15 Macrobotanical Remains

Michael Collins has examined pollen profiles
from Weakly bog, as well as data from Boriak
Bog and the Hall’s Cave microfauna, to
reconstruct past conditions in Central Texas
(Collins 1995:Table 2). The two data sets,
pollen and microfauna, show roughly the
same trends. Particularly relevant for the Vara
Daniel Site is a relatively dry period from
about 9000 to 3000 BP with two peaks, one
at 8000 BP and one somewhere between 5800
(microfauna) and 4300 (pollen) BP. Another
wet period peaks at 12,000 BP, indicating
a cooler, wetter climate changing toward a
modern but arid one during the occupations
that produced Features 4 and 5.
Certainly by the time Feature 1 was created,
and perhaps as early as Features 2 and 3, largely
modern climate conditions were in place in
Central Texas. Table 15-4 shows some of the
important plant food and fiber resources that
would have been present in the vicinity of the
Vara Daniel Site based on current vegetation
and twentieth-century reconstructions of
presettlement vegetation (Carr 2005; Diggs et
al. 1999).
The earlier occupations at the Vara Daniel
Site, when the climate was cooler and wetter,
probably saw a more southern distribution of
food plants that are more common in North
and East Texas today. These plants include
Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus),
ground nut (Apios Americana), camas
(Camassia scilloides), scurfpea (Pediomelum
hypogaeum), black walnut (Juglans nigra),
and eastern persimmon (Diospyros americana)
(Diggs et al. 1999; Turner et al. 2003). A final
plant resource that must be considered for
Vara Daniel inhabitants is the bottle gourd
(Lagenaria siceraria), an important container
plant in traditional societies from ancient
times to the present.

198

The bottle gourd is native to Africa and was
long believed to have floated to North America
on ocean currents. Recent genetic analysis,
however, has demonstrated that American
bottle gourds are more closely related to Asian
bottle gourds than to African ones (Erickson
et al. 2005). Further, the researchers note that
AMS dates for bottle gourds at Guilá Naquitz,
Mexico place their advent in the Americas at
10,000 BP. Nearly all bottle gourd populations
worldwide are believed to be domesticated;
wild populations exist only in Africa (Erickson
et al. 2005). For these reasons, Erickson and
colleagues conclude that archaeological bottle
gourds are believed to represent the fruits of
human labor.
Even under domestication, bottle gourds are not
a fussy crop and grow well with only minimal
human inputs (Heiser 1979). Their cultivation is
easily incorporated into hunting and collecting
lifeways. In historic times, gourds were more
often used as containers in the southeast and
as rattles in more northern areas where birch
bark containers were convenient (Speck
1941). Cherokees used bottle gourds not only
as rattles, but also as dippers and occasional
culinary items (Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975).

15.4	Summary
Macrobotanical remains from the Vara
Daniel Site consist of six fragments of wood
charcoal and one carbonized fragment of an
indeterminable plant part. The paucity of plant
remains is more likely due to the physical and
chemical properties of alkaline environments
rather than an actual lack of plant use at the site.
The modern vegetation of Travis County can be
used to reconstruct some of the more important
plant resources available to early Holocene
inhabitants of the site.

Archaeomagnetic Analysis
By Rob Sternberg

Archaeological samples can be analyzed
to infer temperatures to which they were
heated. The two most common magnetic
minerals, magnetite and hematite, have Curie
temperatures of 580°C and 680°, respectively.
Once heated above these temperatures, these
minerals will lose all previously acquired
permanent magnetization, and can then
become thermally remagnetized as they cool
to room temperature. If the sample remains
unmoved, it will acquire a thermoremanent
magnetization (TRM) that will be parallel
to the Earth’s magnetic field. Portions of
this total TRM, or partial thermoremanent
magnetization (pTRM), are acquired in
various temperature intervals. If the sample
is moved during cooling, one can infer the
temperature at which this occurred due to an
apparent change in the magnetic direction in
sample coordinates. Likewise, if the sample
is reheated below the Curie temperature in a
different position from the original TRM, the
temperature of reheating can be inferred.

16.1	Methods
This chapter will not review all the background
principles. For a full account of the principles
of paleomagnetism, Butler (1992) is an
excellent reference. Most archaeomagnetic
studies (and in fact, the most common
meaning of the term “archaeomagnetic”) use
oriented samples of known age to reconstruct
magnetic field changes in the past, or
conversely, to use reconstructed patterns of
magnetic field changes to date archaeological
samples according to their magnetic

Ecological Communications Corporation

directions. This type of work is reviewed
in Eighmy and Sternberg (1992). The best
review of the application of paleomagnetic
principles to the site formation processes
involving burned stones is Gose (2000). Gose
(2000) also provides a useful reference list of
previous applications of paleomagnetism to
temperature-related site formation processes
in archaeology. These include studies
considering ceramic orientation during firing
(Kitazawa and Kobayashi 1968); cultural
burning of hearth stones and rock clasts
(Barbetti et al. 1980; Bellomo 1993; Gose et
al. 1994); and building burning and collapse
(Shaffer 1993).
Seven samples from the Vara Daniel
Site were subjected to magnetic analysis
(Table 16-1). The weak magnetization of a
number of the samples required the use of
a cryogenic magnetometer. Measurements
were made in the paleomagnetism lab at the
Berkeley Geochronology Center, University
of California at Berkeley. Because most of
the samples were not oriented, principal
component analysis could not be used to
infer absolute directions of magnetization
for different components, as described by
Gose (2000). The different components of
magnetization were inferred by looking for
quasi-linear components on the vector endpoint diagrams.
The oriented samples were drilled using
a drill press. Other samples were cut
with a band saw. Three paleomagnetic
samples were cut from each site. The three
samples from site FL091 (Table 16-2)

limestone (susceptibility units are different
in the Gose paper, but the numerical values
are almost the same in both unit systems).
This suggests that the samples in this study
are also burned, although the somewhat
higher susceptibilities here suggest a slightly
different magnetic mineralogy.

Figures 16-2 and 16-3 are vector
demagnetization diagrams for samples
FL091A and FL091B. The red plots are for
magnetic inclination in sample coordinates,
and the blue for declination. Distance of each
point from the origin is proportional to the
strength of the magnetization (units of 10-6
A m2/kg), which tends to decrease as higher
temperatures in the thermal demagnetization
sequence are reached. The angle between
each red point and the horizontal axis is the
inclination, with positive inclinations being
down, and negative inclinations being up.
The declination of each point is the azimuth
relative to the north direction, on the positive
x-axis. Each linear segment in the diagram
represents a component of magnetization with
a particular direction.

These samples are interpreted to have a hightemperature component of magnetization
with points trending towards the origin;
this could either represent the original
geological magnetization of the samples, or
a high-temperature firing of the samples. The
distinction is difficult to make since most
samples for this project are not oriented,
and principal component analysis cannot be
done. Both samples show low-temperature
components below 100°C, and FL091A shows
an additional component between 100°C
and 150°C. These suggest temperatures

different positions. It is quite possible that
the lowest-temperature component at 100°C
represents a viscous remanent magnetization
(VRM), whereby samples are nonthermally
remagnetized gradually as they sit in the
Earth’s magnetic field (Butler 1992; Eighmy

Samples FL095A and FL095B (Figures

geological or higher-temperature remanence;
lower-temperature component at 400°C, and
also at 200°C for FL095A and 100°C for
FL095B, to which the samples were reheated;
and a low-temperature component at 50°C,
most likely representing a VRM. Sample
FL095B was oriented when collected. I’m
not confident that the calculated declination is
correct, which requires consistency between
the orientation systems used during collection
and measurement. However, the inclination
for this sample of 64° is quite typical for this
latitude (Butler 1992:Figure 1.4), especially
considering the ± 10° change over time that
could be expected due to secular variation
of the magnetic field. This suggests that the
sample required its original remanence (the
high-temperature component) while sitting on
the same side, although the azimuthal position
may have been different than that in which it
was recovered.

the inclinations of 55–60° for these two
samples are consistent with the expected
values for this latitude, suggesting the hightemperature component was acquired with
the sample sitting on the same side, although
perhaps in a different azimuthal position.

temperature in a different position, and several
have two lower-temperature reheatings. All
samples have a low-temperature component,
which probably represents a VRM acquired
as the samples sat in the geomagnetic field in
their current positions.

In summary, as shown in Table 16-3, all
rocks have a high-temperature remanence
component, which could represent a
geological remanence, but could also be a
high-temperature heating of the samples. Each

Research Issues and Site Summary
By David L. Nickels

17.1	Introduction
Chapter 4 discusses in detail the research
questions that we had before the field work at
the Vara Daniel Site began, and the strategies
designed to obtain the best information possible
in order to answer some of those questions. This
chapter serves only to summarize our findings,
as all of them have been discussed in one
manner or another in the preceding Chapters 6
through 16. In most cases we were successful
in our approach and recovery efforts; in a few
cases we were not.
Frederick laid the groundwork in Chapter 6 by
using multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct
the depositional episodes resulting from periodic
inundation of the site by both Barton Creek and
the Colorado River over the past nearly 12,000
years. In Chapter 7, chronological assays and
natural rock quantities and weights were used
to identify periods of landscape stability that
pretty much coincided with peaks in evidence
of human occupation. Cultural features such
as two burned rock hearth clusters, a small
concentration of cultural material on a presumed
occupation surface, a darkened stain, and a
chipped stone concentration were discussed
in Chapter 8, and included archaeomagnetic
results for the two burned rock features.
The most evidence for human presence
through time was in the form of chipped
stone, and Tomka was able to tease out
subtle technological differences that implied
changing subsistence and mobility habits in
the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods. K.
Brown, Howells, D. Brown, Kontrovitz, and
Winsborough conducted an in-depth analysis of

Ecological Communications Corporation

paleoenvironmental indicators in Chapters 10
through 14. Although very little ethnobotanical
information was obtained from flotation
samples, Bush provided useful information
regarding possible plants that could have been
harvested during the period in question (Chapter
15). In Chapter 16, Sternberg contributed an
analysis of archaeomagnetic results. Finally,
Feathers processed OSL samples from the site,
which contributed to the radiocarbon versus
OSL dating regime in this part of Central Texas.
As we stated in Chapter 7, there were lengthy
discussions and considerably healthy debates
over which dating/aging scheme to use when
writing the text for this chapter as well as
others. The general consensus among the
authors was that for continuity’s sake, in this
chapter we would use conventional 14C dates
(BP) as derived from oxygen isotope straightline interpolated conventional radiocarbon
ages (BP), with the zero point set at AD
1950. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, all
dates and ages within this chapter are based
on interpolated oxygen isotope dates. For a
synthesized comparison of all radiocarbon,
OSL, and interpolated dates, the reader is
referred to Table 7-1 and Figure 7-4.

17.2	Paleoenvironment
17.2.1 Barton Creek and
Colorado River Flooding
Michael Blum’s previous work (1992) on the
Colorado River indicated the presence of the
Eagle Lake Alloformation, a late Pleistocene

209

Chapter 17 Research Issues and Site Summary

formation that has been dated to between
18,600 and 15,600 BP. Coming out of the end
of the Pleistocene, and into a slight warming
trend in North America, with severe erosional
forces, the Colorado River cut downward
in its channel, deeply into the Eagle Lake
Alloformation, between about 15,600 and
13,000 BP. About that time, the increasing
temperatures and commensurate ice melt
caused the Colorado to overrun its banks and
deposit floodplains along its course, including
at the Vara Daniel Site. These periodic
episodes of flooding lasted until about 5000
BP, constructing terraces that were occupied
by humans. Blum (1992) labels this 8,000-year
period the Columbus Bend Alloformation,
Member 1 (CBA1). A second collective set
of overbank flooding, deposition, and terrace
building occurred between 5000 and 1000
BP, and is labeled the CBA2. Finally, CBA3
is a set of flooding occurrences that have
happened over the last 1,000 years. Blum’s
work is synthesized here because CBA1, 2,
and 3, flooding events, terrace deposits, and
the presence of stable surfaces that potentially
could have been occupied by humans were
identified by Frederick at the Vara Daniel Site.

BP). K. Brown further posits that at this point
in time, when the gravelly point bar was being
established, the immediate area of the site
below the rugby field was adjacent to Barton
Creek, whereas today the immediate area is
approximately 150 m away from Barton Creek.
Figures 10-8 and 10-9 illustrate snail densities
and species richness. The peaks in both suggest
extreme flooding occurring during the late
Pleistocene continuing through about 10,950
BP (4.9–5.0 mbs).
As the predominantly Barton Creek gravels
accumulated on the aggrading point bar,
lifting it gradually higher, the floodwaters of
the Colorado River intermittently deposited
smaller gravels and coarse-grained sands
on top of the gravels through about 9840 BP
(about 4.2 mbs). Over the next 410 years, from
approximately 9840 to 9430 BP, the Colorado
River exerted its stronger fluvial pressure, and
finer sands with fine clay covered the point
bar to a depth of about 3.4 mbs, before waters
rushing down Barton Creek again began to
cover the immediate area of the site with finer
sands and clays.
Indicators are that from about 10,480 BP
(4.5 mbs) through 9840 BP, the immediate
area transitioned from an upper point bar of
gravels to a lower floodbasin, then to an upper
floodbasin with terrace accretion deposits
around 9600 BP (3.7 mbs). Finally, generally
finer terrace deposits covered the immediate
area through 8630 BP (3.0 mbs) and later.

Localized rainfall in the Barton Creek watershed
would have caused flooding downstream at
the site’s location, bringing with it pieces of
fragmented bedrock from the exposed Lower
Cretaceous-aged limestone. In spite of periodic
flooding by the Colorado River, Barton Creek
provided the most sediment through perhaps
10,500 BP, building a point bar at the site
composed of channel gravels. These deposits
were encountered between 4.4 and 6.2 mbs.

17.2.2 Climate and Biota

Although no radiocarbon dates were obtained
below 4.9 m, K. Brown has identified certain
snail species that appear to be Pleistocene
markers in sediments from 5.0 to 6.2 mbs.
Based on this, it is his opinion that the lowest
gravel deposits, which were penetrated (6.0–6.2
mbs) by augering into the bottom of the block
excavation, more than likely date back to the
Allerod period, ca. 10,970 BP (ca. 11,600 cal

There is no doubt that as with rainfall,
temperatures
have
fluctuated
rather
significantly through time. Using oxygen
isotope values from mussel shells recovered
at the site (Figure 12-4), D. Brown presents
a concise evaluation of the fluctuation in
average annual air temperatures from about
10,950 BP through about 8630 BP, comparing
past temperatures to today’s average annual

210

temperature of 68.6°F. In sum, his data suggest
that temperatures have fluctuated from nearly
1°F warmer to almost 12°F cooler than today’s
modern annual average. About 10,905 BP, the
annual temperature was approximately 68°F,
much like today.
However, as K. Brown points out in Chapter 10,
during the colder interlude called the Younger
Dryas that began roughly around 10,970
BP (12,900 cal BP), rainfall amounts were
greater than today and were generally constant
throughout the year, unlike today’s seasonal
late spring and fall patterns. Commensurate
with the consistent rainfall, cooler water from
Barton Springs probably flowed constantly,
and at much greater velocity than today. Using
carbon isotope data, Frederick (Chapter 6)
corroborates that during this time temperatures
were probably lower than today, with the
likelihood of significant and rapid fluctuations.
Following the Younger Dryas, the temperatures
then began a general warming trend, signaling a
change to more seasonal rainfall and less spring
flow, with increased water temperatures from
Barton Springs. D. Brown posits that by about
10,650 BP, temperatures warmed to slightly
over 69°F. A sharp and significant cooling trend
then occurred, reaching an annual low below
58°F around 9840 BP before sharply warming
again back to 66°F around 9800 BP. Over the
next 400 years, temperatures fluctuated between
60 and 68°F before plunging again to just over
58°F around 9400 BP. By approximately 9000
BP, average annual temperatures rose back to
66°F, fluctuated somewhat between 64 and
66°F for the next approximately 400 years, and
then rose to 68.6°F by around 8500 BP.
Between about 10,650 BP and 9800 BP (4.6–
4.0 mbs), K. Brown submits that it is plausible
that the immediate area of the site was covered
with shallow swales in which vernal pools
accumulated due to either flooding or rainwater.
However, these pools were of short duration
(perhaps two to three weeks), drying out rapidly
due to the generally xeric conditions. Within

Ecological Communications Corporation

this period, around 10,310 BP, it is likely that
a small levee formed in the immediate area,
trapping rain and flood waters in a floodbasin
setting. Snails trapped within this floodbasin of
muddy, shallow, stagnate, and hypoxic water
survived only for a few weeks, until the small
ponds dried up. Both the species richness and
densities in snails and ostracodes from about
10,395 to 9817 BP (4.3–4.0 mbs) suggest
that extreme flooding occurred at times. As
the ponds periodically dried up, ground cover
bushes and plants intermittently returned.
Snail data included in Chapter 10 indicate
that from about 10,395 BP through 8830 BP
(4.4–3.0 mbs), the terrace in this immediate
area was generally xeric, well-drained, open,
and relatively void of deciduous tree cover,
with perhaps scattered leaf litter and dead
wood. That is not to say there were no trees
outside the immediate area; conversely, there
were most likely woodlands along both Barton
Creek and the river. K. Brown has identified six
species of snails existing within this time frame
that thrive in open, dry woodland, brush, or
grassland environments. The study of Rabdotus
during this period suggests that the climate
became increasingly arid through time, and
the immediate terrace becomes somewhat drier
through about 8630 BP (2.9–3.0 mbs).

Mobility
17.3.1 Pre-Clovis
Tomka (Chapter 9) posits that although the
ages from the lower portion of the site (ca.
4.1–4.9 mbs; 10,900–9800 BP) suggest the
possibility of a pre-Clovis occupation, the
chipped stone artifacts probably do not. He
caveats his opinion in that our most current
information on the prehistory of Texas does
not as yet clearly define what diagnostics and
other pieces of chipped stone constitute a preClovis assemblage.

211

Chapter 17 Research Issues and Site Summary

17.3.2 Clovis (ca. 4.1–4.9 mbs;
10,905–9840 BP)
Tomka (Chapter 9) has identified a small
number of chipped stone tools (e.g., blade
end scrapers and gravers), and manufacturing
traditions that could be associated with a Clovis
occupation at the site in his AU 3, which dates
to around 10,905–9840 BP). Tomka has further
compared the probable late Clovis tradition
chipped stone assemblage of AU 3 (ca. 4.1–4.9
mbs; 10,905–9840 BP) with the probable early
Late Paleoindian assemblage in all of AU 2
(3.6–4.1 mbs; ca. 9840–9430 BP) and the lower
portion of AU 1 (3.3–3.6 mbs; ca. 9400–9200
BP). The Clovis-like affinity artifacts and raw
material found suggest that those who occupied
the site from around 10,905 years ago through
about 10,395 likely stayed at the site for
relatively longer periods than did subsequent
occupants. This coincides with a fluctuating
climatic period during which there was
relatively less rainfall and temperatures about
2°F cooler than today. However, after about
10,395 BP through 9840 BP (4.2–4.4 mbs), the
air temperatures and annual rainfall decreased
significantly, with the temperature dropping
nearly 11°F below what we know today. During
this ca. 555 years, Tomka argues that the lithic
assemblage is typical of hunter-gatherers that
are highly mobile, moving across the landscape
with wide-ranging mobility, frequently
revisiting the Vara Daniel Site but occupying
it for shorter durations. The lithic assemblage
at the Vara Daniel Site during these 555 years
is a reflection of assemblages observed at other
early Paleoindian components.

17.3.3 Late Clovis to Early
Late Paleoindian
Transition (ca. 3.6–4.2
mbs; 9840–9634 BP)
Apparently reacting and adapting to the thenincreasing changes in both annual rainfall and
temperatures, Tomka’s analysis suggests that
the hunter-gatherers of later Clovis/early Late
212

Paleoindian age (ca. 9840–9634 BP; 3.6–4.2
mbs) became even more highly mobile,
moving frequently across the landscape,
exploiting a diversity in plants and animals,
coming back to the Vara Daniel Site even less
frequently, and staying at the site for even
shorter periods than before. Arguing for this
roughly 200-year transitional period, within
the overall assemblage Tomka has observed
chipped stone artifacts that could represent
what we have heretofore accepted as either
late Clovis or early Late Paleoindian. In sum,
it thus appears that the Vara Daniel chipped
stone assemblage from 3.6 to 4.2 mbs (ca.
9840–9634 BP) represents a late Clovis-toearly Late Paleoindian transition period.

17.3.4 Late Paleoindian Period
(ca. 3.3–3.6 mbs; ca.
9634–9230 BP)
The Late Paleoindian occupation is most clearly
manifested in artifacts recovered from 3.3 to
3.6 mbs (ca. 9634–9230 BP), most notably
with a St. Mary’s Hall point found between 3.3
and 3.4 mbs. The examination of chipped stone
indicates that more tools were being made from
non-local raw material, suggesting that huntergatherer mobility during this 400-year Late
Paleoindian period may have been more wide
ranging than any other.

17.3.5 Late Paleoindian
to Early Archaic
Transition (Unknown)
Tomka clearly sees the Early Archaic deposits
as existing above 3.2 mbs and the Late
Paleoindian component as existing between
3.3 and 3.6 mbs. Unfortunately, the overall
assemblage is too small to tease out with
confidence a Paleoindian-to-Early Archaic
transition either in terms of depth below
the surface or years before present. He does
posit that the abrupt and significant drop in
temperature that occurred around 9230 BP
(3.3 mbs) should have caused significant
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

changes in the use of the land and how long
the site was occupied, but sees no evidence of
a transitional phase in the very limited chipped
stone assemblage.

17.3.6 Early Archaic (ca. 2.9–3.3
mbs; ca. 9230–8630 BP)
The small quantity of chipped stone recovered
from 3.0 to 3.3 mbs is considered inadequate
to confidently assess the Early Archaic
component. Although most of the tools
recovered above 3.3 mbs represent highenergy inputs in the form of points, a drill, and
bifacial adzes, the assemblage is biased by the
indiscriminate recovery that occurred during
the public screening of overburden from the
2–3 mbs pile. However, assuming that the highenergy input tools do represent a pure Early
Archaic occupation, then it can be said that the
predominately bifacial, expensive, and formal
technology represents hunter-gatherers who
were predominately foragers seeking a wide
variety of plants and animals, and in pursuit
of such moved their residences frequently
(Binford 1980; Hayden 1986; Parry and Kelly
1987). Their short occupation spans at the Vara
Daniel Site may also be manifested in the two
burned rock hearths found between 2.9 and 3.0
mbs. Archaeomagnetic results from the burned
rocks suggest both hearths were likely used
three times (see Chapter 8).

17.4	Summary
All of the research issues discussed in Chapter
4 were addressed during this project. The
overall goal of the project was to target the
Paleoindian component of the site, and that
was accomplished. Whether any of the artifacts
from the deepest part of the excavations could
be of pre-Clovis origin was not ascertained.
However, artifacts with early Paleoindian,
Clovis-like affinities were discovered, along
with a few artifacts that could represent a
transitional period of approximately 200 years
from early Paleoindian to late Late Paleoindian.
A research issue that could not be addressed
with a degree of confidence is the Late
Paleoindian-to-Early Archaic transition that
is still poorly understood in Texas. In this
case, there simply were not sufficient data to
properly address this issue. One of the key
issues we attempted to address was a solid
reconstruction of the paleoenvironment and
site formation processes that have occurred at
the site. Although there are always more data
that one would like to have, we believe the data
that were obtained from this excavation are
sufficient for our endeavor to be successful.
Figure 17-1 synthesizes and summarizes the
information we garnered from the data, thanks
to a multitude of professionals and specialists
from across the country.

at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Chapter 18

A Regional Perspective
By J. Joshua Haefner and Mason D. Miller

18.1	Introduction
Due in part to an archaeological record that is
comparatively rich in sites dated to the Late
Pleistocene and Early Holocene, Texas has
long held an influential position in Paleoindian
research. A number of important sites have
been discovered in the state, including Lone
Wolf Creek, Miami, Lubbock Lake, Lipscomb,
Plainview, Bonfire Shelter, Gault, WilsonLeonard, and Aubrey. All of these sites have
added to the known record of Clovis, Folsom,
and Late Paleoindian archaeology and, in
some cases, augmented previous perspectives.
It is important to interpret how findings from
the Vara Daniel Site fit within that record and
how it advances our larger understanding on
lifeways for this period.
This interpretation must, however, be
tempered with the understanding of the small
study area relative to the overall site size. A
16-m2 excavation within a site that stretches
over 65 acres hardly creates a well-rounded
and all-encompassing interpretation of the
lives of its prehistoric (or historic) occupants.
Conclusions for prehistoric activity as
reflected in the material culture recovered
from the Vara Daniel Site excavations
(especially considering the relative paucity of
artifacts) are therefore somewhat ambitious
projections. While paleoclimatic data can
be considered more or less uniform across a
given locale (with slight variability, pollen
grains will fall at a given site at the same
rate and composition), cultural data can not
(features and artifact deposits reflect activity
areas and periods of intensive use, not uniform
occupation). The discussion below therefore
represents conclusions drawn from a specific
Ecological Communications Corporation

excavation location. Excavations at another
portion of the site (potentially even a hundred
meters away) or even larger-scale excavations
within the site could provide completely
antithetical conclusions. The results seem to
indicate a landscape that was less intensively
utilized during the earliest phases of human
occupation, but the reasons for this discrepancy
are yet to be answered.

18.2	Pre-Clovis
While archaeological sites that date earlier
than Clovis have been gaining acceptance,
there is little agreement on what constitutes
a Pre-Clovis site or assemblage. Early
supporters of a pre-Clovis existence in the
Americas envisioned a less specialized
technology system than that of the big-game
hunters (Dillehay 2000). According to this
perspective, pre-Clovis peoples were foragers
and scavengers who travelled in small bands
and exploited whatever the local environment
offered. Their technology is posited to be
characterized by simple percussion-flaked
tools that are both large and crude, with
choppers and expedient unifaces. Under
this paradigm, this generalized technology
could likewise produce sites that are devoid
of projectile points and, hence, assemblages
would be hard to identify. At the Meadowcroft
and Cactus Hill sites, however, components
identified as pre-Clovis contained small,
unfluted, bifacially flaked projectile points
and prismatic blades. Although similar in style
to Clovis lithic technology, these items were
described by Collins (2002) as “not Clovis.”
Recent studies have linked bone-working
technology to millennia prior to the Clovis era
215

Chapter 18 A Regional Perspective

(Holen 2006; Johnson 2005), an indication
that there may be an overdependence on
chipped stone and the widespread use of
flaked tools as an indicator of technology
for pre-Clovis cultures (Thoms et al. 2007).
In Texas, the best evidence for this bonequarrying technology might be in the Post
Oak Savannah/Blackland Prairie region as
evidenced in such sites as Richard Beene, San
Antonio River, and Munger Branch (Thoms
et al. 2007).
Given the relative paucity of definitive
evidence of pre-Clovis occupation in the
New World, there is correspondingly limited
archaeological data indicating subsistence
strategies and food preferences for this
period of Texas prehistory. Probably the
most extensive collection of faunal remains
from Texas that likely dates to pre-Clovis
occupations comes from the Petronila Creek
Site (41NU246) near Corpus Christi (Lewis
2009). This creek-side bone-bed site contains
potentially culturally-linked faunal remains
of a variety of animal species including large
mammals and megafauna such as mammoth,
ground sloth, camel, bison, and horse, as
well as many smaller animals such as rabbit,
prairie dog, squirrels, birds, alligator, lizards,
tortoise, and a large array of fish (alligator
gar, catfish, bull head, etc.). Faunal materials
from Late Pleistocene components such as
those from the Richard Beene Site (41BX831;
including spiral-fractured and/or burned
specimens) indicate a broad subsistence
pattern, utilizing a variety of animal species
in close proximity to the site. While the faunal
assemblage included six bone fragments from
very large mammals (likely bison)—the only
recovered at the site—indicating at least some
degree of preference for larger mammals, a
relatively large complement of other species
was encountered as well, including frogs,
turtles, rabbits, snakes, and birds, as well
as undetermined small mammal fragments
(Baker and Steele 2007:230–231). With both
sites, there is a clear interest in large mammals
and/or megafauna; however, the quantity and
variety of smaller species is a clear indication
216

of a broader, more opportunistic subsistence
strategy for possible pre-Clovis occupants of
Texas.

18.3	Pre-Clovis
Comparisons from the
Vara Daniel Site
There is no clear evidence of pre-Clovis
occupation from the excavated portions of
41TV1364. According to Frederick (see
Chapter 6), the site itself formed on a highenergy-deposited gravel bar with the earliest
interpolated oxygen isotope ages for these
deposits dating to approximately 11,000–
12,000 BP. This age places it among the
earlier reliable Paleoindian age range for Texas
(Bousman et al. 2004). The Wilson-Leonard
site was likewise formed on a gravel bar, in
this instance deposited by Brushy Creek, while
other sites such as the Aubrey Site in Denton
County likewise housed their earliest occupants
on similar gravel bars immediately adjacent
to creek channels (Bousman et al. 2004:36;
Collins 1998:3–4). These bars presumably
provided abundant lithic resources while
remaining closest to diverse riparian plant and
animal materials, as well as water. This does
not, however, suggest that Paleoindian cultures
exclusively occupied only these landforms, as
extensive soil-denuding episodes during the
terminal Pleistocene have likely removed traces
of an unknown quantity of occupation sites in
other contexts (see Paleoclimatic Background).
Tomka (see Chapter 9) suggests that flakes
intermixed within the upper components
of this bar were likely redeposited from
other locations as a result of flood events.
Due to secondary deposition and a lack of
complementary organic dates, it is impossible
to determine if the flood-deposited flakes were
preserved in situ for a week or a millennium
(or more) before being carried away in the
current and redeposited. Found beneath all
Clovis-like deposits at the site, these flakes
may have originated at a pre-Clovis-period
City of Austin

at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

site somewhere else in the project vicinity.
Tomka concludes otherwise, but concepts of
pre-Clovis toolkits are yet to be determined,
making such interpretations preliminary.

18.4	Early Paleoindian
Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview sites are
most directly attributed to Early Paleoindian
occupations in Texas. The majority of artifacts
observed within the Vara Daniel Site are
defined as having Clovis-like affinities with no
other indications of other clearly Paleoindian
cultures exhibited. The widespread abundance
of Clovis points throughout Texas is consistent
with the contention that human occupation was
established regionally well before 11,200 BP.
Infrared stimulated soil dates from the Gault
Site push Clovis occupations back as far as
approximately 13,000 BP. Clovis’s apparent
temporal spread from the western Gulf Coast
to the north and west suggests that the Clovis
components of the Vara Daniel Site could
be representatives of the longest lived, and
therefore presumably most developed, of
the Clovis cultures (Beck and Jones 2010).
Within Central Texas, the majority of Clovis
points are distributed in an arc-like pattern,
beginning in Abilene in the north and swinging
south, clockwise through Austin and San
Antonio, ending in Uvalde County. This arc
roughly follows the same line as the Balcones
Escarpment. Just below the Escarpment lies the
Gault Site, the largest Clovis site discovered to
date. The western half of the Edwards Plateau
is nearly devoid of Clovis points (Bever and
Meltzer 2007). With the exception of the Bone
Bed, Lubbock Lake, Wilson-Leonard and the
Wilson Sites, most Paleoindian sites on record
for Texas have low artifact counts (Bousman et
al. 2004). Rarely have Paleoindian sites been
found with intact features, and burned rock is
scarce (Collins 2002 ).
Central Texas sites seem to generally be larger
in size than those from the Lower Pecos and
Plains, although this could well be a result

Ecological Communications Corporation

of the high number of artifacts recovered at
Wilson-Leonard and Gault skewing the data
(Bousman et al. 2004). Predominantly, sites
that have been discovered in Central Texas have
been described as camp sites (Wilson-Leonard,
Loeve-Fox, Richard Beene, and Levi Rock
Shelter). Generally, an assemblage associated
with a Paleoindian campsite will have more
cobble and pebble raw material, burin spalls,
and ground stone tools, while kill/butchery sites
seem to have comparatively higher numbers of
projectile points.
Clovis cultures are widely presented as
primarily big-game hunters—indeed the cause
of the mass megafauna extinction that closely
corresponds to their expansion across the New
World (Alroy 2001 ; Haynes 2002; Waguespack
and Surovell 2003). Citing archaeological
evidence from numerous kill and brief
occupation sites dating to this early phase
of the Paleoindian, Clovis peoples are often
described as nomadic, highly mobile hunters
who almost universally target mastodons,
mammoths, camels, and giant bison, skipping
smaller, yet more readily available (and
presumably less dangerous) animals in the
process. Within Texas, there are numerous
archaeological sites that fit this model,
including (among others) Duewall-Newberry
(41BZ76), Hockley County (41HQ1), Miami
(41RB1), and McLean (41TA29; Bousman
et al. 2004:Table 2.5). At each of these sites,
archaeological resources indicate a single,
very short-duration kill/butchering station
specifically targeting extinct megafauna
(mammoth, short-faced bear, ground sloth,
etc.) with only limited (if any) use of smaller
animal species. This model has a large number
of detractors, however. Citing an inherent bias
toward large (and therefore better-preserved
and more immediately visible) faunal remains
in Clovis sites (Collins 2002; Meltzer 1989)
and a lack of a modern large mammal-targeted
hunting analog, other archaeologists suggest
more generalized subsistence (Waguespack
and Surovell 2003). Open-air Clovis sites
excavated within Texas appear to indicate that

217

Chapter 18 A Regional Perspective

the latter thought, Clovis as generalist, is the
more likely lifeway interpretation—at least
regionally (Cannon and Meltzer 2004).1
At the Gault Site, a short distance north of Vara
Daniel, archaeologists encountered a variety
of culturally-modified faunal remains (or
animal remains clearly in cultural context) that
indicate a broad, generalist hunting strategy,
with specimens including frogs, birds, and
small mammals, along with horse, bison, and
mammoth. A consistent complement of lithic
tools at Gault that changed very little as they
temporally span pre- and post-megafaunal
extinctions also suggests that Clovis in Texas
were opportunistic, generalist hunters; if they
solely hunted megafauna, it would stand to
reason that their tools (presumably designed
specifically for hunting and butchering
extremely large, mobile game) would invariably
change after their mass extinction (Collins
2002). At Wilson-Leonard, an early Paleoindian
bone bed contained a large number of bison
(and bison-like large mammal bone) but also
included turtle, rabbit/hare, and other medium/
small mammals (all of which had examples
that were burned). At least two bison, due to
the presence of non-utilitarian bone fragments
along with high-yield pieces, were likely killed
and butchered on or near the occupation site
(Baker 1998:1506). The early Paleoindian
faunal component of the site indeed matches
Late Archaic and Early Prehistoric deposits,
from periods of widely accepted generalist
hunting strategies, very closely.
Often, due to preservation constraints, the
analysis of lithic artifacts may be the only avenue
to examine issues of mobility in prehistoric
populations. The majority of recent studies
dealing with how lithic technology is organized
within the broader spectrum of hunter-gatherer
1 As discussed by Baker (1998), while faunal
assemblages from caves often carry good to
excellent preservation potential, they are often
difficult to interpret due to predatory animals
using the same space as humans, blurring the
line between culturally-linked bone and natural
deposits.
218

adaptations have established an association
between the level of effort expended in stone
tool production and mobility patterns. In
this vein, tools designed with minimal effort
expended are considered informal tools and
those that require more effort are known
as formal tools. Characteristically, formal
tools are multifunctional, easily modifiable
and transportable, qualities that limit risks
associated with being unprepared while mobile
(Andrefsky 2005:227).

18.5	Early Paleoindian
Comparisons from the
Vara Daniel Site
As discussed by Tomka (see Chapter 9),
AU 3’s apparent high core/biface reduction
ratio suggests a relatively low mobility and
increased site occupation duration/frequency
during the Early Paleoindian period. AU 3.1
contains the second highest number of flakes
that bear multi-faceted platforms and the
highest percent of multidirectional dorsal flake
scars, while AU 3.2 exhibited the secondlowest percent of multiple flake scars and
lowest percent of multidirectional dorsal flake
scars. Additionally, platform preparation flake
frequency peaks in AU 3.2. It should be noted
that the majority of artifacts recovered during
excavation were concentrated in AU 3.2, and
the high percentage of tools reported for this
analytical unit may be representative of more
frequent visits to this locale during this period,
with increased duration between visits. This
could be an influence of weather as interpreted
temperatures and rainfall at that time (Brown
this volume) were much cooler and dryer than
modern conditions.
The paucity of artifacts recovered from
the Early Paleoindian components of the
site (particularly in relation to later-period
occupation sites in the region such as the Davis
Spring Branch Site, 41WM989, measured in
some locations at more than 2,000 g of debitage
(roughly 700 flakes) per 10 cm3 [Karbula et al.
City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

2007]) is in line with prevailing interpretations
of Paleoindian occupation in Texas consisting
of very few artifacts. Artifact densities from
the Early Paleoindian-phase occupations
at the Wilson-Leonard Site are similar to,
though higher than, those of the Vara Daniel
Site, at an average of approximately 87 lithic
specimens per cubic meter (versus 78 items
for the Vara Daniel Site; Collins 1998:Table
7-1), suggesting relatively low-intensity site
utility over repeated visits with a generally
rapid soil aggradation rate. It is important
to stress, however, that the site appears to
be most intensively occupied during these
earliest cultural phases, with artifact densities
declining over time. This is not a common
trend for Texas prehistory, as population
increases over time typically results in more
intensive site use and, in turn, denser site
components (Karbula et al. 2007).
The general lack of burned rock features
from the Vara Daniel Site, or burned rock
for that matter, from the lowest occupational
components of the site also falls in line with
Paleoindian trends; however, burned rock
features are not entirely unheard-of in Central
Texas. The two features attributed to the Early
Paleoindian period from the Vara Daniel Site
excavations were a small soil stain (Feature 4)
and a black chert lithic concentration (Feature
5). Archaeologists could not find analogs of
these feature types from similar periods in
the region, with the majority of Paleoindian
burned rock features (such as Feature 188
from Wilson-Leonard; Collins 1998:128)
resembling those of later occupations at the
Vara Daniel Site (see below).

2004). Along with a change in technology, the
shift to the Late Paleoindian period is often
characterized as a shift in adaptive strategies
from a focus on Pleistocene big-game hunting
and high mobility to a strategy that was more
reliant on local resources and limited mobility
(Anderson 1996; Haynes 1980; Stanford
1999), although we know now that Paleoindian
adaptive strategies were more complex than
thought before (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins
2004). Evidence from the coast indicates
that Late Paleoindians utilized numerous
gouge tools (Aiuvalasit 2007:61). The Late
Paleoindian archaeological record shows
evidence for diversification of projectile point
styles and overall changes in lithic technology
relative to the Early Paleoindian periods. For
Central and South Texas, Hester (1976:9) noted
that the “terminal Pleistocene in Texas appears
to have a wide range of adaptations, reflecting
the use of fairly localized environments and
resources, and leading to the development
of regional lithic specializations.” The
reorganization of plants and animals in
response to climate change at the end of the
Pleistocene may have resulted in the adoption
of multiple strategies across different regions
of a continent. The decline of fluted point
traditions may be attributed to an adaptation to
this environmental change (Newby et al. 2004).

18.6	Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic
Regional Perspective

Intensive exploitation of local habitats
associated with a range reduction in residential
mobility is a characteristic hallmark of the
Early Archaic. Generally, then, one would
expect to find limited numbers of exotic
materials in Early Archaic components and
a near exclusive use of local lithic material.
Also in consort with the concept of reduced
mobility would be an increase in the abundance
of woodworking tools such as adzes, gravers,
drills, and spokes—tools consistent with the
manufacture of wooden implements, tools, and
residences, arbors, and storage platforms.

Unfluted point styles associated with the Late
Paleoindian tradition include Plainview, Cody/
Scottsbluff, and St. Mary’s Hall, dating from
around 10,200 or 10,000 BP to 8500 BP (Collins

9000 BP, an abrupt shift occurs in subsistence
technology, and sites post-dating this shift are

fire-cracked rocks in high quantity. This shift
from a Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence
strategy is measured by a change in technology
focused on the use of these burned rocks to
process geophyte plant foods. At the WilsonLeonard site, and at roughly comparable ages at
several other Central Texas sites, this transition
in subsistence strategy is documented back as
early as 8800 BP (Black et al. 1998 ; Decker et
al. 2000 ; Thoms et al. 1996). Late Paleoindian
and Early Archaic deposits at Wilson-Leonard
contain a decreased frequency of bison remains
with increased quantities of rabbits, rodents,
turtles, birds, and deer (Baker 1998:1507). The
Wilson component is dated at 10,000–9650 BP
and is associated with features, a burial (itself
an indication of a revered locale and therefore
increased sedentism), and artifacts that are
more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian
(Collins 2004).
Recent excavations of the Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic components of the Berdoll Site
(41TV2125; ca. 8,800 BP) unearthed a broadbased subsistence strategy utilizing frogs
and turtles, snakes, rabbits, mice, fish, and
mussels, along with deer and undetermined
large mammals (also likely deer), the majority
of which (more than 75 percent) were burned.
Along with the diverse faunal assemblage,
floral specimens (very rare in Texas sites of this
antiquity), indicate a preference for acorns and
lily/onion bulbs in cooking as well. All of these
elements were likely butchered/processed on
site in possible isolated activity areas.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas
archaeological literature suggests that the Early
Archaic occupations were generally small,
widely distributed, and nonspecialized (Black
and McGraw 1985). Explanations for these
characteristics indicate a generalized huntinggathering strategy involving relatively high
group mobility and short-term occupations.
Within Central Texas, population density may
have been low, though this may reflective of
a to-date sampling bias of well-documented
Early Archaic sites (Ricklis and Collins 1994).

220

18.7	Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic
Comparisons from the
Vara Daniel Site
Dates reported for AU 2 (360–410 cmbs)
correspond well with the Late Paleoindian
period for Central Texas. Platform analysis for
AU 2 indicated that there was a higher ratio
of core reduction, suggesting a reduction in
residential mobility compared to preceding
and subsequent periods of occupation. It
should be noted that there was a high number
of flakes that were reported as exhibiting
multidirectional dorsal flake scar patterns, a
trait that is usually associated with bifacial
reduction. If there was indeed a decrease in
residential mobility, this would be in line with
an increase in local resource exploitation and
limited mobility that is a posited trait of the
Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic transition.
Additionally, this occupation demonstrated
a correlation between artifact counts and
magnetic soil susceptibility value peaks, an
indicator that the site was more intensively
occupied during this period, although the
low density of artifacts recovered in this AU
suggests less frequent visits to this site.
Unfortunately, resources recovered from the
Vara Daniel Site were devoid of significant
evidence of unique subsistence preference
characteristic for any period of Texas prehistory.
Within the excavation block, archaeologists
recovered an abundance of gastropod shells,
which could be evidence of subsistence
preference, but it is difficult to discern whether
these shell deposits are culturally generated
for food or are natural accumulations of snails
actively feeding on left-over food sources from
a vacant archaeological site.
Dates (see Table 6-3) reported for AU 1
(300–360 cmbs) encompass the early half of
the Early Archaic and the latter centuries of
the Late Paleoindian period in Central Texas.
Two projectile points were recovered that help

at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

place AU 1 in temporal context; from 290 to
300 cmbs, a Gower/Uvalde type was recovered
during hand excavation. This type has been
dated by Turner and Hester (1999) and Collins
(2004) to approximately 6000–7000 BP, a
date range that is in line with the radiocarbon
dates reported by Frederick (see Chapter 6). A
St. Mary’s Hall point was recovered between
330 and 340 cmbs, near the middle of AU 1.
Collins (2004:118) dates this point type to
the end of the Late Paleoindian period, from
approximately 9500–8000 BP, noting their
association with a “transitional” stage between
the Paleoindian and Archaic periods. Lithic
analysis for AU 1 indicated a high percentage
of faceted platforms (see Chapter 9), suggesting
that biface manufacture was high during these
site occupation periods, a possible indicator of
increased residential mobility and short term
occupancy.
Although not as devoid of artifacts as this
component of the Vara Daniel Site, two sites in
the Central Texas region have similar short-term
Early Archaic occupations buried deeply in the
soil column: the Berdoll Site (41TV2125) and
the Richard Beene Site. Lithic analysis from
41TV2125, a very Early Archaic site located on
the floodplain of Onion Creek in Travis County,
illuminated several aspects of prehistoric lithic
technology (Campbell et al. 2010). Lithic
analysis from deposits radiocarbon dated to
approximately 8990–8600 cal BP noted that
at Berdoll, “bifacial technology appears to be
the primary tool form” and early-stage biface
reduction seems to have occurred in association
with several of the site features (Campbell et
al. 2010). A moderate occurrence of edge
modified flakes (n = 9) suggests that, on-site,
an expedient tool technology was at least
partially utilized to accomplish some tasks.
Meanwhile, the apparent production of biface
blanks “may signal awareness on the part of the
inhabitants that they are moving into areas with
lower resource availability or are preparing for
seasonal activities that require more bifaces”
(Campbell et al. 2010).

Ecological Communications Corporation

The early Early Archaic populations (ca. 8800–
8600 BP) at 41BX831, the Richard Beene
Site, have flake size and cortex patterns that
are consistent with generalized core reduction
and behaviors that result in high ratios of small
flake sizes, such as biface maintenance and the
manufacture of tools from small cortical flakes
(Dockall and Pevny 2007:180). However, the
manufacturing of bifaces did not appear to be
a significant component of these early Early
Archaic assemblages. Instead, edge-modified
implements dominate the tool assemblage
(Dockall and Pevny 2007:186). This assemblage
therefore is seen as a direct contrast to the bifaceoriented tools and debitage observed at Vara
Daniel and Berdoll. Although the dates for this
component fall at the transition mark between
the Late Paleoindian and the Early Archaic, its
“Archaic-ness” is indicated by the amount of
cook-stone debitage (n = 14,939) present at the
site and a number of woodworking tools.
Overall, all four analytical units demonstrated
a low density of artifacts per cubic meter
when compared with other sites in the region
with similar antiquity. This suggests that from
the Early Paleoindian period to the advent
and during much of the Early Archaic, this
site, or at least the tested portion of this site,
was inhabited short term and intermittently.
Tomka (see Chapter 9) notes that the lithic tool
assemblage, which is dominated by expedient
and minimally retouched tools manufactured
on site utilizing mostly local materials, is in line
with this interpretation. If this interpretation
bears out for the entirety of 41TV1364, then
this would be quite anomalous to such similar
setting sites as Wilson-Leonard and Gault,
locales that were intensively occupied during
the Paleoindian period.
At Wilson-Leonard, where at least 212 burned
rock features have been documented to date from
all major temporal units, Late Paleoindian/Early
Archaic features include pit features, artifact
and bone clusters, and burned rock features
(Guy 1998:1067). While there are several
burned rock clusters that may reflect rock oven

221

Chapter 18 A Regional Perspective

utilization, the bulk of the burned rock features
from a similar time frame to those at Vara
Daniel were small and hearth-like. Similarly,
both burned rock features (Features 2 and 3
dated to 8630 BP and 9030 BP, respectively,
through oxygen isotope interpolated 14C dates)
at the Vara Daniel Site are described as small
hearths. Still, in comparison of construction,
the Paleoindian hearths (or clusters as they
are described) at Wilson-Leonard are often
composed of upwards of 15 rocks, while at
Feature 2 Vara Daniel consisted of nine firecracked limestone pieces and Feature 3 of
merely three pieces. Collins (1998:279) writes
that ca. 8800 BP, occupants at Wilson-Leonard
began to construct large domestic cooking
features, a departure from the smaller cooking
features that employed fewer stones.
While there is a small similarity in hearth
features between Vara Daniel and WilsonLeonard, other sites within Central Texas have
temporally equivalent burned rock features
that are widely different than those at the
Vara Daniel Site. For example, burned rock
features from the Berdoll Site in Travis County
appear to be much more substantial than those
encountered at Vara Daniel. Excluding the
central, intensively used, large hearth, hearth
features were more frequent and substantially
larger, some measuring over 70 cm in diameter
and composed of over 25 burned rocks. When
compared to temporally comparable Features
2 and 3 from the Vara Daniel Site, the Zilker
Park occupation is much less substantial, again
suggesting a smaller group utilizing the site for
shorter durations than those a short distance to
the southeast at Berdoll. Additionally, while
small hearths are found throughout the Berdoll
site (common for Paleoindian occupation), a
much larger and more substantial central rock
oven could indicate a period of longer, more
intense occupation, or perhaps an episode
or episodes of intense resource exploitation
at the site, potentially issuing in the burned
rock middens that are synonymous with the
later phases of the Archaic in Central Texas
(Campbell et al. 2010).

222

From archaeomagnetic assays, researchers
determined that rock from both features had
each been fired three times. It is quite possible
that Features 2 and 3 were once components
of the same, somewhat larger hearth, with
the smaller cluster raked out after its use. In
combining Features 2 and 3 into a single hearth,
burned rock quantities and size fall more in line
with typical family-sized burned rock features
of the Early Archaic.
Other temporally comparable sites in Central
Texas that have burned rock features seem
to exhibit patterns that are overwhelmingly
similar to Berdoll and contrasting to what has
been documented at Vara Daniel. For instance,
at the Number-6 Site (41BX996) the burned
rock features tentatively dated to approximately
8500 BP have been described as a series of
large, overlapping earth ovens. One rock oven
bed measured 3 x 2 m and was composed of
over 700 rocks. Excavation bias aside, such
sites have been documented frequently enough
to suggest that aggradation associated with
an increase in intensive resource exploitation
pattern occurred in many locales throughout
Central Texas.
There is solid evidence for a substantial change
in subsistence technology at many sites in
Central Texas dating to the advent of the
Early Archaic period. This change is marked
by the utilization of large, rock-lined earth
ovens that would later herald the beginning
of the burned rock midden, a near-ubiquitous
feature across the Central Texas landscape. The
current excavations at Vara Daniel revealed no
evidence that large earth ovens were ever in use
at the site.
Keeping in mind that rocks become burned
for a number of reasons drawn from a diverse
set of cultural behaviors, not all of which
are subsistence based, it does seem plausible
to suggest that the burned rock features
from Vara Daniel represent small cooking
or heating fires that are more indicative
of a Paleoindian lifeway, characterized by

City of Austin

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component

short-term occupations and high mobility, than
of an Archaic one; a pattern which seems to be
at least partly corroborated by Tomka’s lithic
analysis. Likewise, while artifact densities
increase for the above-referenced sites during
the Early Archaic, the analytical unit (AU 1)
associated with this time frame at Vara Daniel
had a very low artifact density, 7.19 items per
cubic meter (see Chapter 9), a far cry from
what one might expect from an aggradation
site centered on hot rock oven baking.

18.8	Overall Conclusions
In comparison, the density of features and
associated lithics seems to suggest that WilsonLeonard, Berdoll, Gault, and other sites were
all more favored locales that were occupied
with more longevity and repetition than the
Vara Daniel Site. Given what can be inferred
as a setting that is no less ideal for intensive,
sustained occupation (riparian floodplain
adjacent to varied faunal and plant resources,
abundant lithic resources, and a ready source
of fresh water) this seems unusual. While it
is entirely possible that comparable, higherintensity occupations are still hidden within
unexcavated regions of the site, if the trend
observed within the excavation block were to
continue over a larger area, the Vara Daniel
Site excavations could prove very valuable
in developing and testing hypotheses of site
location preference. More specifically, the site
is not simply a negative hole in which there is
no way to conclude how people lived (if they
lived there at all), it is a site that for a very long
time was occupied, but apparently only in very
limited intensity. Why was the Gault Site used
so intensively while this site wasn’t?
Was the site simply too close to the water or
too wet and muddy for the first occupants?
Frederick (see Chapter 6) has demonstrated that
the Colorado River has migrated away from the
Vara Daniel Site over time and was likely very
close to the excavation area at the time of its
first occupations. Snail species examined from

Ecological Communications Corporation

the excavations (see Chapter 10) suggest that
the immediate landform during the waning
Early Paleoindian and into the Late Paleoindian
was likely muddy with floodbasin pools and
stagnant water. Without higher ground nearby,
this clearly would be a locale that was avoided.
Perhaps that is reflected in the generally
antithetical trend of decreased use from the
Early Paleoindian through the Early Archaic.
Are there similar environmental conditions in
nearby sites? While later in occupation age,
the Davis Spring Branch Site (41WM989) is
located adjacent to a spring-fed creek channel
that produced a marshy, muddy landscape
throughout its history to modern day, indicating
that ancient groups were not entirely averse
to wet conditions (Karbula et al. 2007). Were
the lithic resources at the Vara Daniel Site of
lower quality? Tomka (see Chapter 9) indicates
that the majority of lithics were acquired from
local sources. Is there a relatively excessive
indication of breakage when compared to other
assemblages?
The publicly screened upper (younger)
elevations contained a greater number of tools
within a relatively smaller amount of screened
sediment (see Appendix J). This indicates that
the landscape was more intensively utilized and
likely more habitable during later phases. What
conditions made the site more hospitable then
than in earlier periods? For that matter if further
excavations did indicate areas of more intensive
use, what about those areas made them so?
Overall, the rather limited material culture
recovered from the 2009 excavations (when
viewed in relation to other sites in the region)
can provide a great deal of new insights into
prehistoric human action and thought by
providing a much-needed antithesis to the
better-known, more intensively occupied and
investigated sites of Central Texas. In that
respect, the Vara Daniel Site excavations are
tremendously valuable, and additional research
is warranted to coax out more answers (and
potentially more questions).

Public Outreach Program
By Mason D. Miller and Rachel J. Feit

Ecological Communications Corporation

C-1

Appendix C Public Outreach Program

Zilker Park is one of Austin’s most-used and best-loved public spaces. It receives thousands of
visitors daily who come to swim in Barton Springs, walk, run, bike, kayak, play intramural sports,
picnic, play on the playground, and more. In addition to everyday activities, Zilker Park is a popular
destination for school field trips and the home of festivals such as the Austin City Limits music
festival, which hosts more than 80,000 attendees annually. In preparing the scope for the excavations
at the Vara Daniel Site, the City of Austin and the THC rightly anticipated that any archaeological
work conducted within Zilker Park would generate curiosity. Therefore, the scope for the project
specified that the excavation should include a public outreach component. This proactive program
would not just inform park visitors about the work that was taking place at the site, but also provide
an opportunity to engage the public in archaeology and Austin’s prehistory. According to the scope
issued by the City of Austin, the public outreach was to “include development of a temporary
interpretive exhibit associated with the excavation. The exhibit should be manned with an individual
knowledgeable of the archaeology of the site and the region at least 8 hours per day, 7 days a week
during the period when the data recovery excavation is in progress (City of Austin 2008).” A portion
of the overall project budget was specifically devoted to public outreach tasks.
EComm embraced the City’s goals for public outreach and took this mandate as an opportunity
to involve the public in archaeology using a number of different innovative approaches that went
beyond the scope requirements. These approaches included not just the public information booth and
exhibit specified under the contract, but also included opportunities to view the site and excavations,
scheduled tours and talks about archaeology, public screening for artifacts, atlatl and flintknapping
demonstrations, and a dedicated web page and webcam for the excavations.

Public Information Booth
The public information booth was the only element of EComm’s outreach program required by
contract. In designing the site layout and the needed fencing intended to protect both site and public,
EComm took into account the need for
a public information booth. An area
was set aside within the fenced project
area perimeter that was accessible by
a separate entrance. This area backed
up to the excavation pit, which was
protected by steel shoring to more than
four feet above the ground surface
(Figure C-1). Visitors to the booth could
look over the chest-high steel shoring
directly down into the excavation pit
and witness the excavation unfolding
before their eyes.
The information booth was staffed
every day of the week between the
hours 9am to 5pm. Stacy Drake
and Matthew Carter served as the
primary liaisons at the information
booth. EComm staff archaeologists

and the THC was also available at the
booth. Visitors were allowed to enter
the booth, view the exhibit, observe the excavations, and ask questions during most times of the
day. The public information booth received a number of walk-up visitors each day who were
curious about what was happening at the park. Not surprisingly, weekends were much busier for
walk-up visitors than weekends.
In addition to unscheduled walk-up visitation, EComm used the booth and full-time interpretive
staff to offer scheduled tours of the site. The tours were generally aimed at families and school-aged
children and consisted of a brief introduction to archaeology in Central Texas and the Vara Daniel
Site and site viewing opportunities, followed by a chance to screen dirt removed from the upper three
meters of the site. Through the project website and email address (see below), members of the public
were able to reserve specific times for tours.
EComm staff was overwhelmed at the number of requests for tours they received. The designated
excavation email address (Paleodigger@gmail.com) received dozens of emails a day from individuals,
church groups, homeschoolers, scout troops, and other organizations requesting tours of the site.
Requests were also received from public schools like Travis Heights Elementary, which scheduled
a field trip for its fourth- and fifth-grade science classes. EComm staff responded to each request to
schedule a tour time and answer questions.

Public Screening
One of the more engaging aspects of the EComm public outreach program was the opportunity
for the public to participate in the practice of archaeological methods through screening. EComm
supervised up to 100 visitors a day as they sifted through dirt looking for artifacts. The methodology
for the primary excavations offered a unique chance to allow for this sort of public involvement. In
targeting the Paleoindian component of the Vara Daniel Site, investigators mechanically removed
the upper three meters of soil over the site. As the overburden was removed, EComm staff instructed

the machine operator to place sediment
in three different piles corresponding
to three rough proveniences: 0–1
mbs, 1–2 mbs, and 2–3 mbs. Each of
the piles was placed within the main
fenced perimeter, in an area that was
eventually separated from the main
excavation pit (Figure C-3). This
allowed the outreach staff to bring
visitors into the screening area without
posing a safety risk to non-excavation
personnel.
Part of the public tour experience was
to allow visitors the chance to screen

public screening area and overburden piles.
This plan was approved by both the
City of Austin and the THC prior to
implementation. Under the supervision
of EComm staff and approved volunteers, visitors sifted
through dirt looking for artifacts, and indeed, many were
found (Figure C-4). In fact, more complete tools were
found through public screening than during the actual
excavations.
EComm personnel were careful to control access to the
screening area (to prevent unauthorized screening),
and careful to document the finds generated from the
screening activities. As visitors found artifacts on the
screens, EComm personnel bagged them according to one
of the three rough provenience piles (0–1, 1–2, and 2–3
mbs). These artifacts were entered into a catalog, though
not analyzed with any rigor. While a list of the artifacts
from the public screening (Appendix J) will be included
in the materials permanently curated for this project, the
artifacts themselves will remain with the City of Austin
and will be used for future exhibits.
EComm was also careful to control the message conveyed
to the public with the screening. Visitors were allowed
to screen only after being introduced to the practice of
archaeology through a brief talk summarizing the methods
and rationale behind standard archaeological practice.
The talk stressed the differences between archaeological methods and looting, and made it clear
that the public screening they were doing simulated archaeological methods, but did not necessarily
adhere to all professional archaeological standards. In other words, EComm wanted to ensure that
visitors understood that professional archaeological methods involve more than just screening dirt
for artifacts.

Special Demonstrations
The public outreach program benefited
from volunteers who graciously
donated their time to give special
demonstrations
of
prehistoric
activities. Roy Wenmohs of the Austin
Atlatlists and Logan McNatt of Texas
Parks and Wildlife gave atlatl throwing
demonstrations on weekends and on
weekdays when large school groups
arranged to visit the site (Figure C-5).
These demonstrations gave visitors
the opportunity to witness some
of the hunting techniques used by
prehistoric peoples in Texas. Chris
Ringstaff of the Texas Department
of Transportation also gave a superb
flintknapping demonstration to the
science classes from Travis Heights
Elementary School. Students observed
Chris as he made stone tools from raw
chert. He explained both how and why
prehistoric peoples made and used
stone tools to survive (Figure C-6).

the project staff to effectively integrate,
organize, and disseminate information
about the project. Though not required
under the original scope of work, EComm proposed a project web site and the City of Austin eagerly
agreed to the plan. Mason Miller of Hicks & Company took on the task of designing and implementing
the site. Initial plans called for the website to be relatively static, with occasional images and email
links to contact various representatives of the City and the archaeologists themselves. This basic plan
would have sufficed, but modern web development tools and integration of Web 2.0 concepts allowed
for a site that provided a much more dynamic and immersive experience for visitors. It also provided
simple operations for updating and a more direct personal connection with site explorers. This more
dynamic site would keep the public involved and interested by giving them a reason to continue
revisiting the page. The tools and resources used for website production made the development
process very easy.

proved to be a much greater contribution to the overall project than initially anticipated (Figure C-7).
Thanks to the ease of many of the development tools available, the web site was approachable and
relatively user friendly. The site went so well, and Mason learned so much during development,
that the process is worth briefly describing. Throughout this discussion, it is important to stress that
nearly all of these resources are completely free and, since they are web based, in most instances do
not require specific hardware or software beyond a computer connected to the internet with a current
web browser. It is also important to note that the web tool examples that are provided in the following
discussion are simply those chosen by the author and the design team. There are numerous analogs
for each of these components that would likely produce similar results and similar compatibilities.

Web 2.0
Concepts and tools of Web 2.0 development were the key components of producing Archeologyatzilker.
com (Figure C-8). According to Wikipedia (2009), Web 2.0 can be described as the tenet of modern
web design and development that relies on shared content, inter-related data sources, user-centered
design, and collaboration. When the web first exploded in the 1990s, sites were relatively static
entities with single pages that would load when prompted; little more than a digital book or magazine.
The internet itself was considered a large, digital library of data that were already formatted and
packaged for consumption, and the site visitor had very little input on content. Links were presented
for content and accessed by navigating away from one page to another. Web 2.0 concepts focus
on tying multiple data sources together to bring all content to a single site, making their union a
simple task for any user to complete. More importantly, web content is much more of a two-way
street, where site visitors are generators of content almost as much as they are consumers of it.
Though essentially none of the tools for web developing have changed (code and graphic standards,
servers, etc.), the intent and process of web development have evolved. The page itself serves as a
shell or basic framework that is populated by varying internal and external data sources, resulting
in a site that is much more of a community resource. Fruits of Web 2.0 development include social
websites like Facebook and Twitter, image and video hosting sites like Flickr and Youtube, mapping/
navigation pages like Google Earth, and information sources like Wikipedia.
For the purposes of developing Archeologyatzilker.com, Web 2.0 tools utilized were focused primarily
on site coding and content sharing, whereas public content provision was less of a goal of the page.
Though certain tools used require a higher degree of technical expertise than this relative design
novice could provide, once the framework was completed by a professional web designer, widelyavailable information and easy access became the key components to developing Archeologyatzilker.

Wordpress—The Framework
Wordpress was the primary software used in developing Archeologyatzilker.com. Available through
Wordpress.com, the program is an open-source1 web design tool that makes web design and updates
fast and easy, and… it’s free. At its most basic level, Wordpress is a web page that designs other
web pages. Wordpress’s basic software coding and content are loaded onto a web server, and content
for the web site is added and changed through it. Wordpress creates, edits, and adds to all of the
complex, specific, and challenging code and does so in the background, leaving a website developer
with a graphic interface that looks and operates a lot like a word processing program (Figures C-9
and C-10). Most importantly, since Wordpress is a web page that edits web pages, the only dedicated
software that is required is loaded onto the site’s web server. All other access to the program and
web content creation and editing is done through the web browser, with no other software required.
While there are literally hundreds of Wordpress tutorials available through the Wordpress website
(wordpress.org—Wordpress’s online tutorial site) and on other sites that go into great detail about
exactly what to do and how to do it, for Archeologyatzilker.com, developers relied on the expertise
of a web development studio (Nathan Hanners of Really Really Big Industries, Inc. [RRBI]) to set
up the basic site skeleton and host the site during excavations. A small fee of $1,500 was set aside to
allow RRBI to assist with site programming and troubleshooting during the period of most intense

for creating and editing content, incorporating new plugins, and changing the design
and theme of the site; the user can also review and address visitor comments.
1 Open-source is a term used for software that is developed with an intentionally open coding structure allowing
for individual customization. Beyond Wordpress, another prominent example of open-source programs is
Mozilla’s Firefox Web Browser.

site use. Hanners proved to be an invaluable addition to the design team, solving a variety of glitches
much more quickly than relative novices with trowels could.
At RRBI’s offices, Hanners set aside server space and built the basic template for the site, which
included simplified banner graphics, a web page title, typefaces, link formatting, etc. Through
Adobe® Photoshop® and Adobe® Illustrator®, the archaeology team was able to provide graphic
alterations to the basic template by designing new headers and footers to make the site unique.2
While the header mostly performed titular tasks (naming the website and the current page), the
footer provided a variety of quick links to various relevant agencies at the City of Austin (The City’s
main web page, the Parks and Recreation Department, Austin Public Works, etc.) as well as the
project’s two main contractors (EComm and Hicks & Company). The site’s basic look (formatting,
color scheme, background, etc.) were adjusted to fit the theme desired, and a basic introduction page
was created to test the overall appearance. Once everything was approved by the City and other
contractors, the page went live.
Through Wordpress, a website is set up as a series of posts and pages. Pages are primarily static,
permanent documents on a site, while posts are updated regularly (as often as the designer wishes)
and are visible as multiple entries on a single page. Archeologyatzilker.com contained a variety
of pages discussing everything from project background and schedule to Central Texas prehistory,

and editing web content within Wordpress.
2 For Archeologyatzilker.com, we simply went to Zilker Park and took digital photos of various familiar elements
of the park and used those photos, along with an image from a previous excavation, for each of the page’s
banners.

Appendix C Public Outreach Program

while the posts formed the Excavation Blog, which was updated regularly (usually every day or so)
with the latest excavation news. With both posts and pages, site updates involved writing the text and
formatting it as done in any word processing program, complete with font changes, color, emphasis,
etc.
Once a page or a post was completed, the editor would preview it for formatting and spacing, click
Publish, and the page/post was up and active on the site! As excavations continued, the pages did not
change, though some pages were added as the web site was adjusted to meet visitor requests.

Primary Visual Content
Graphics are the key component of any modern web page. Archeologyatzilker.com was no different.
Photos and videos were frequently used to accompany text within the site to great effect. Wordpress’
design tools allowed these graphics to be added to pages easily through handy icons that walk the
user through the uploading process. For most graphics, we used a stable of photographs and dedicated
graphics prepared for the website that were uploaded to the site’s Media library. Other images were
hotlinked from other websites.3 Photos from the excavations were updated through integration of
the project’s Flickr page through Hicks & Company’s premium Flickr account (flickr.com/photos/
hicksandcompany; see below; Figure C-11). Free Wordpress add-ons, called plugins, were loaded
into Archeologyatzilker.com that allowed the site to access the Flickr page and download the latest
photos from that site and place them automatically on the main page. Updates to the excavation’s
complement of photos were automatically visible on the archaeology website with no need to direct
visitors away or for complex, repetitive coding.
To assist with providing modern, dynamic content on the page, Archeologyatzilker.com also utilized
the wealth of online videos available by embedding clips from YouTube (youtube.com) directly
into a given page or post with a very simple programming statement: “youtube=“ followed by the
complete address of the target video (Figure C-12). The benefit of Youtube cannot be overstated.
If, as the saying goes, “… a picture is worth a thousand words…,” a video is worth so much more.
Typing “atlatl” into the Youtube search bar returns nearly 500 videos. Any one of those videos can
define what an atlatl is much more effectively than a textual description.4

Other Tools and Page Components
Beyond relatively simple pages and posts, Archeologyatzilker.com also included more dedicated
content. This consisted of a project schedule page, Texas Beyond History, and an excavation webcam.
Using an excavation-specific email account through Google’s Gmail (paleodigger@gmail.com)
EComm staff could access a suite of Gmail organizing tools, most notably a calendar (Figure C-13).
The excavation email account became a convenient non-company-specific means of contacting
the archaeologists that could be accessed with a simple web browser through the park’s WiFi
network. As the project proceeded, the schedule, noteworthy project milestones, public involvement
opportunities, etc. were periodically updated through the Gmail account calendar and, through

address.
4 When inserting reference videos, it is very important to preview the video in its entirety to make sure that it
doesn’t contain content that is objectionable to your target audience. While Youtube does have restrictions on
content, those restrictions may not be strict enough for a given website (language, gore, etc.). In other words,
don’t rely on Youtube to police the content that it is providing.

For many of the glossary and background sections, Archeologyatzilker.com referred offsite to Texas

information for the site visitor to learn more about a given topic. Within the cultural background
section, TBH was used to provide examples of sites attributed to a specific discussion topic. For
example, within the discussion of the Paleoindian period, Archeologyatzilker.com included links to

on TBH.
The web site also used a
dedicated webcam, which
filmed the excavations in
progress and streamed them
onto the project website. This
allowed people to observe the
excavations from any location,
and provided yet another
interactive component to the
website. EComm installed
a simple internet webcam

mounted the webcam to the

network run by the City of
Austin throughout Zilker Park,
the webcam’s built-in software
integrated the video stream through html and javascript code and then copied it directly into the
website through a dedicated Wordpress page. The webcam essentially established a web address for
itself that hosted the video stream through the attached notebook connected through the park’s wireless
network, while the javascript code loaded into the excavation website and directed the visitor to the
stream’s address. This process was technically more complex than other website components and
was left to Hanners of RRBI and Dan Rose of EComm to complete; however, according to Hanners,
the operation is relatively straight forward and approachable for anyone with a little know-how.

Public Outreach Reconsidered—What
Worked, Room for Improvement
The resulting public experience was generally positive, with the City’s administrative and public
works offices receiving many thanks and praises from citizens and visitors alike. In many ways, the
public outreach component of the project took on a life of its own, becoming as important to the goals
of the project as the excavations themselves. Part of this was due to the project’s high-profile location
in Zilker Park and general public interest in archaeology. But enthusiasm for the public outreach
program among the EComm team, the City of Austin, and the THC also played an enormous role.
Once the team began imagining the possibilities for public outreach, it was a small (and logical) leap
to expand the scope of the program to include many different, yet integrated components.
Indeed, part of the reason the public outreach program worked was because the team was able
to articulate the various activities in concert. The website played a critical role in this task. The
website served as a virtual museum/bulletin board/storefront that published information about the
site and various activities for the public. Tours of the site and activities were scheduled through
the Gmail/Google Calendar account. With the simple, free, and non-proprietary email account,
members of the public were able to contact the archaeologists directly and receive direct responses.
Paleodigger@gmail.com was a very popular email account that received more than 250 emails over

the course of the two-month excavation. The associated Google Calendar proved indispensable for
the archaeologists juggling many public screening appointments and tours. With the park’s wireless
access, the calendar could be adjusted on-site, and those changes were visible on the web page
immediately and automatically.
The dynamic aspects of the website were in many ways successful. Through daily photo uploads using
Flickr, the team kept the site visually interesting. Meanwhile, the excavation blog engaged the public
through fresh narrative context. The webcam enabled site visitors to see the actual archaeological
work taking place from any location in the world. Simply put, the public had a reason to revisit the
site, and their interest was generally maintained throughout the course of the excavations.
The real-time activities through the site’s public information booth complemented the information
published through the website. The public information booth, staffed seven days a week, was
indispensible. This booth put a friendly face to the project, making it open and transparent to all
of Zilker Park’s curious visitors. The special tours, demonstrations, and particularly the screening
opportunities enhanced the experience of visiting the site. While the EComm team was initially
reluctant to allow the public to screen the overburden removed from the upper three meters of the site
(because they were worried it could send an inappropriate message about archaeological methods),
this turned out to be perhaps the most popular aspect of the public outreach program. In screening
dirt from the site, visitors embraced the excavations as participants, making the project truly public.
While the public outreach program was indisputably successful, it was not without its road bumps.
Though enthusiasm for the public outreach program infected most of the EComm team members,
it should be stated that few of the individuals involved in its implementation had experience in
coordinating the type of program that was ultimately envisioned. This was certainly the case with the
project website. While Archeologyatzilker.com was a beneficial component of the project’s public
involvement program, developing and maintaining the site was an unfamiliar process for most of
those involved. Along the way, the archaeologists and site authors learned a few things through
problems faced in site development and maintenance. None of these problems were considered
particularly dire or difficult to surpass, but they are lessons learned nonetheless.
The first problem encountered was the amount of effort that was involved in keeping the site up
to date. While keeping the site dynamic up front was a good decision, it was more laborious than
initially anticipated. The work is very simple and straightforward, but it does take time. At the end of
a long day of excavating, it was difficult to muster the energy to upload the latest photos, write about
findings, and integrate additional content into the site. The City fielded occasional complaints from
the general public about the apparent lack of website updates, and the complaints were forwarded on
to the excavators. To remedy this, the site was updated more frequently, with archaeologists devising
new topics to discuss (i.e., radiocarbon dating, what an archaeologist does, etc.). In future projects
with a similar public involvement component, it would be wise to consider enlisting someone who
is exclusively dedicated to maintaining the site and keeping it updated with the latest information.
The second website-related problem had to do with managing unwanted comments and email. Once a
site is on the web, it is open to the inevitable influx of electronic junk mail, or spam. At the beginning
of the project, legitimate visitor comments were easy to find and directly responded to (often posted
on the site directly). As time progressed and the number of posts increased, the site administrator’s
Comments box filled rapidly with junk meant to bypass various spam filters built into many software
programs. Within a few days, Archeologyatzilker.com had thousands of spam comments for every
one legitimate comment. It was impossible to manually wade through all of the comments to find
C-14

at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

legitimate ones and address them. After the page was developed and excavations eventually ceased,
the web site manager learned that Wordpress has an effective built-in spam filter called Aksimet that
removes most of the junk content; however, it was not turned on. In the future, spam-filtering software
should be activated immediately. It may not filter everything out, but it will help tremendously.
Other issues were related to public outreach activities through the information booth. When EComm
project managers initially met with the Austin Parks and Recreation (PARD) staff to discuss the
public outreach program in Zilker Park, representatives of PARD counseled EComm not to advertize
the program too broadly for a couple of reasons. They knew from experience that visitation at
the park is already high and that the public information booth was likely to be busy with curious
onlookers without any advance promotion. They were also concerned about ensuring the quality of
the public experience. That is, they did not want to advertize the excavations and the public activities
too broadly without adequate staff, parking, and interpretation to support them. And they were right.
While EComm devoted almost two full-time staff positions to daily public outreach, they quickly
discovered that this was not nearly sufficient to handle the number of visitors and scheduled tours of
the site. Though project mangers took PARD’s advice and limited the announcement of site tours to
a few scout troops and schools, through email, the message went viral, and soon the public outreach
staff was receiving requests for tours from dozens of Girl and Boy Scout troops, church groups, and
home-school groups. This was seen by all as a positive thing, but the designated public outreach staff
was at times inadequate to handle the public interest.
In terms of the public experience, some visitors seemed unimpressed by the exhibit provided in the
public information booth. None of the EComm team members had any previous professional curatorial
experience, and that was undoubtedly evident in the booth exhibit (see Figure C-2). Interpretive
exhibits require not only careful planning, thought, and execution, but also an aesthetic sensibility
that engages the viewer. EComm’s exhibit was amateurish at best and could have profited from more
experienced planning and execution. Future attempts at interpretive displays would certainly benefit
from the participation of someone with more experience designing exhibits.

New Ideas for the Future
As previously stated, the Zilker public outreach program proved to be not just a valuable educational
effort to the public, but also a lesson to project planners. In embracing a range of tools for public
outreach and education, the EComm team discovered many new ones that could profitably be used in
the future. This is particularly true with respect to web-based and electronic media.
Utilizing personal update websites like Twitter (twitter.com), social networking sites like Facebook
(facebook.com), and open-source, web-based word processing and accounting software such as
Google Docs (docs.google.com), new opportunities for public involvement are possible.5
Twitter is a free personal blogging service that allows a user to post limitless, short (125-character)
statements, called “tweets,” that other visitors, called “followers,” can see in real time. Tweets can be
updated directly through the Twitter webpage or through a user’s cell phone via text message. Most
Twitter tweets discuss a person’s daily activities or thoughts they may have. Creating an excavation
Twitter account could prove to be an interesting addition to the project’s web presence, especially for
5 All of these services have the added benefit of being automatically built into most major web search engines,
allowing for an excavation website to show up on web searches more readily.

very dynamic sites, by allowing archaeologists to use their cell phone to tweet about what they are
finding at that moment, i.e., “I am bisecting a small hearth…” or “we have found a cache of musket
balls…”
Utilizing social networking sites like Facebook could prove to be an excellent way to add to a project’s
web presence. By creating a free Facebook account for the excavation and periodically updating that
account, the public can follow the excavation as a “Fan” or “Friend.” Public visitors could add their
own comments to these posts just as easily, though there is less control of the comment contents on
the part of the archaeologists.
Finally, the free, online office suite provided by Google, called Google Docs, may also prove very
useful in the right contexts. With a Gmail account, a user has access to a free complement of webbased standard word processing, accounting, and presentation programs stored securely online.
Archaeologists may wish to consider providing a secure, unalterable copy of an excavation’s artifact
catalog on Google Docs’ spreadsheet program and make that spreadsheet accessible to site visitors,
or upload the site map as a single slide in a Presentation file. The catalog could be made available
to school children, potentially for use as a science project, encouraging them to download the data,
manipulate them as they see fit, and provide their own interpretations of the site and its occupants.

Conclusions
Overall, more than 630 staff hours were devoted to public outreach, representing about seven percent
of the total project budget. This does not include the hours volunteers donated. While EComm and
the City of Austin believe that the outreach program fostered significant public goodwill toward
the project and archaeology in general, the implementation of such a program in the future must be
considered up front, as this was, in project budgets and schedules. For large, high-profile projects
such as this one, the rewards of a comprehensive public outreach program certainly outweighed the
cost.
The EComm team was grateful to have the opportunity to explore the exciting menu of possible tools
that can be employed to involve the public in archaeology, and will certainly apply this knowledge
and experience to future projects.

Appendix H Sediment Sample Flotation Processing and Results

Methodology
A total of 770 sediment samples were collected from site 41TV1364, from which 118 samples
were selected for flotation analysis (Table H-1). Eleven of these samples were collected from areas
immediately surrounding one of the five identified features, while seven sediment samples were
collected for the purpose of microcarbon analysis and were not floated. The remaining 100 samples
include column samples and general unit samples. Bucket-to-bucket flotation was conducted to collect
any cultural or organic materials within the sediment samples, and their contents were recorded for
further archaeological analysis.
Column samples were collected in the field by excavating around a 10 x 10 x 10-cm column within
a unit, usually in the northeast corner of the unit. After excavation of the unit was complete, the
column was removed and stored in plastic bags containing the appropriate provenience information
and sealed with a twist tie. Feature samples were collected directly adjacent to and underneath the
identified feature area and were stored in the same manner as the column samples. The volume of
feature samples depended on the amount excavators deemed necessary in order to gather an adequate
amount of data from the sediment.
Sediment samples were collected from the five features in areas with the highest potential for charcoal
or organic material. The collected sample was measured into single liters in the laboratory and floated
in its entirety (with any remaining sediment under 1 L floated as a whole sample). Column samples
were collected vertically from the northeast corner of a selected unit at an estimated volume of
1,000 cm3 within each 10-cm unit level from 3.0 mbs (20 samples). For the purpose of flotation and
analysis, a single liter was floated from column samples exceeding the target collection amount; 1
L of general unit sediment underwent flotation as well. Excess sediment beyond the prescribed liter
was wet screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh, and materials found therein were included with
general unit screen tallies.
During flotation, 1 L of sediment and 10 L of water were combined in a bucket and allowed to soak
for at least ten minutes. The mixture was agitated to break up any conglomerated materials, allowing
the lightest materials (light fraction) to float to the surface while the heavy fraction remained on the
bottom of the bucket. Only the surface water was poured through a 0.355-mm sieve suspended over a
second bucket, and was then returned to the original bucket. After repeating this process three times,
the light fraction extracted was washed and set aside.
The mixture was again agitated and poured through a series of nested sieves with openings measuring
0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm. The sieves were arranged from largest opening to smallest, top to bottom.
The water and sediment mixture was poured into the nested sieves and washed through with a water
sprayer to ensure the materials passed through the smallest-sized mesh possible. To avoid damaging
artifacts, sediment was not forced through the sieves by hand; as a result, occasional dirt clumps were
included in the fraction group. Materials collected in the sieves were then washed, and the contents
of each of the four sieves was placed onto an appropriately marked sheet of paper and stored in a
drying rack.
Once dry, the collected materials were weighed and analyzed in their respective fraction groups within
each single-liter flotation sample, which was assigned a laboratory reference number (HC Sample
No.). Culturally significant materials recovered included carbonized and non-carbonized botanical
remains (i.e., seed, grass), faunal remains (i.e., bone), and chert flakes. Resulting quantitative and
qualitative data were entered into a sample catalogue for analytical and record-keeping purposes.

During analysis, sediment samples from features were of particular interest due to higher potential
for cultural remains. Following flotation, feature samples were sent to Leslie Bush for macrobotanical
analysis (see Chapter 15).

Results
The flotation process yielded fewer artifacts than originally expected. Materials indicative of cultural
activity such as microliths, carbonized plant remains, and faunal remains were very sparse; the
majority of samples revealed little more than gravels, uncarbonized roots, snail shell, and calcium
carbonate concretions. In the event a feature sample contained multiple liters of sediment, each liter
was floated, analyzed, and recorded separately. The flotation results are presented in Table H-2, and
their implications in regards to overall archaeological significance are discussed below.

Feature 1
Feature 1 is an isolated scatter of lithics and shells within site 41TV1364. One liter of sediment was
collected for flotation analysis at 2.90–3.00 mbs (Level 0). Flotation revealed uncarbonized roots,
shell, and gravels (typical content of all flotations, unless otherwise noted), while macrobontanical
analysis reported two uncarbonized seeds (hackberry and grass) and two fragments of hardwood
charcoal (species indeterminable). Bush explains uncarbonized plant remains are assumed modern
in open-air archaeological contexts; therefore, uncarbonized seeds were not considered culturally
significant. She refers to the wood charcoal of Feature 1 as “suspiciously clean,” concluding
the incidence is likely a result of modern contamination. Therefore, the results of flotation and
macrobotanical analysis indicate an overall lack of cultural evidence within the Feature 1 sediment
sample.

Feature 2
Nine liters of sediment were collected from Feature 2, a small hearth, between the depths of 2.90 and
3.00 mbs (Level 0). Flotation revealed higher instances of gravels and calcium carbonate concretions
(CaCO3) in comparison to other feature and column samples collected at the same level, which
does not coincide with the direct relationship between depth and amount of gravels and CaCO3
concretions seen in other sediment samples (see below). According to macrobotanical analysis, one
chert flake, five bone fragments (species undetermined), and one carbonized but indeterminable
seed were extracted from the sediment, making up the cultural materials seen in Feature 2. Five

uncarbonized seeds (hackberry and one legume) and five fragments of black plastic (likely from the
dustpans used to collect the samples) were also reported within the sample.

Feature 3
Feature 3 is recorded as an isolated scatter of burned limestone. During the flotation process, two
chert flakes along with CaCO3 concretions were recovered in the 3 L of sediment collected between
3.08 and 3.20 mbs (Levels 1–2). Macrobotanical analysis revealed two bone fragments (species
undetermined) and four pieces of poorly preserved wood charcoal (species indeterminable). Noncultural materials also reported include three uncarbonized seeds (hackberry) and one fragment of
plastic.

Feature 4
Feature 4, described merely as a dark stain, contained approximately 200 mL of sediment from
a depth of 3.70–3.80 mbs (Level 8) for the purpose of flotation (other samples from Feature 4
contained microcarbon and were not floated). Neither flotation nor macrobotanical analysis reported
any instance of cultural materials.

Feature 5
Feature 5 is a lithic concentration from which approximately 800 mL of sediment was collected at a
depth of 3.80–3.90 mbs (Level 9). Flotation did not yield any culturally significant materials, though
a significant increase in the amount of gravels in relation to other features was noted; this, though,
coincides with the increase in gravels seen in other samples collected at this level, and is therefore
likely a natural phenomenon rather than a cultural manifestation. Macrobotanical analysis resulted in
the identification of two bone fragments (species undetermined) and one plastic fragment.

Column Samples
The column samples (along with general unit samples) revealed a scarcity of cultural materials to an
even greater extent than in the feature sample analyses. Column samples were taken from specific
units (Units 1, 5, 6, 13, and 16) for general spatial and cultural distribution purposes, and all column
samples from those units were subject to flotation processing. Overall, the results of the flotation
process reveal similar characteristics within each column collected. General trends as well as specific
instances of exception are discussed below.
The columns exhibited the same materials most commonly recovered in feature samples: shell,
uncarbonized roots, and gravel; however, two clear changes are seen in the column samples across
each of the units investigated. At Level 10, an increase in the amount of heavy fraction (in grams) in
comparison to all previous column levels occurs at a rate of approximately 380 percent. Likewise, a
sharp increase around Level 18 of the amount of CaCO3 concretions occurs across all of the column
samples.
Units 6, 13, and 16 all exhibit an increase in light fraction at Levels 17–18, the same levels at which the
distribution of debitage recorded in the field clearly depicts increases in site occupation (Figure H-1).
Though significance of the correlation is uncertain, Levels 17–18 within the column samples undergo
a notable increase in both debitage distribution and the amount of light fraction, composed primarily
of uncarbonized plant fibers and roots with occasional Rabdotus shell fragments. According to Bush,
uncarbonized plant remains are almost certainly the results of modern contamination, which would
indicate the increase in light fraction is simply a case of contamination during excavation. In contrast,
the relationship could possibly be attributed to an impenetrable layer of sediment underlying Levels
17–18, preventing materials (specifically debitage and light fraction) from migrating any deeper
below the surface. Finally, the significant amount of tree roots encountered during excavation of the
block poses the possibility that the light fraction is simply a by-product of floralturbation. Though
the cause is unknown, the significance of Levels 17–18 within the column samples is indisputable.
Furthermore, Level 17 also yielded a tertiary flake during Unit 13 flotation. Unit 5, which did not
undergo the light fraction increase at this level, also contained a bone fragment (species undetermined)

in Level 17, followed by a pressure flake in Level 19. In addition, Level 20 yielded two tertiary flakes
recovered in the Unit 1 flotations.
Unit 16 was the most unpredictable column sample of all the selected units. A mussel shell was
recovered in flotation from Level 5, a contrast to the myriad of snail shells seen throughout all of the
other samples. Also in Level 5 was a possible biface thinning flake, immediately followed in Level 6
by a charcoal fragment (species undetermined). Unlike Units 1, 5, 6, and 13, the findings in Unit 16
do not coincide with any previously determined level of site occupation at this depth.
The only general unit sample to contain cultural material was Unit 14, from which a tertiary flake
was recovered during flotation.

Conclusions
The results of flotation and macrobotanical analysis reveal a generally low incidence of cultural
material relative to initial expectations. The feature, column, and general unit samples yielded 30
artifacts from an overall total of 393 L of floated sediment. Of the artifacts recovered, those found
in Levels 17–18 appear the most archaeologically significant due to their correlation with more
intensive site occupation. Overall, analysis of the sediment collected from site 41TV1364 resulted in
a scarcity of archaeological data that contributes normally to overall site interpretation.
The most efficient strategy for flotation involved soaking the sediment for at least ten minutes before
attempting to wash it through the nested sieves. Prefacing flotation with soaking not only made
the process less arduous, but also decreased the amount of dirt mistaken for solid material (i.e.,
gravel), which prevented inclusion of insignificant materials in the analysis. Also, maintaining the
smallest groupings of artifacts possible proved to be invaluable when data were recalled long after
the flotation process ended. For example, storage of the separate fraction groups within each liter
of each collected sample kept the very few cultural materials from getting lost amongst the vast
numbers of shell and gravel the sediment contained.

Appendix K Snail Species Accounts

This section describes the different taxa recovered (Table K-1), providing a brief account of shell
condition, uncertainties in classification, habitat preference, and other relevant matters. Species are
categorized first as terrestrial, amphibious, or aquatic, then listed in approximate order of abundance
in the 3–5-mbs snail column, rather than in taxonomic order as is usually done.

Terrestrial snails
Rabdotus cf. R. dealbatus Adults, Rabdotus sp. Juveniles,
and Rabdotus sp. Spires, Age Indeterminate
Two species of Rabdotus are known to occur in Travis County, Rabdotus dealbatus and R. mooreanus
(Neck 1994:150). The two are similar in size and shape (Brown 2006:Table 8.16; Fullington and
Pratt 1974:Plate III, Figures 2, 5). According to Fullington and Pratt (1974:16), “it is generally
found along stream bottoms and in similar open woodlands within the prairie, being replaced by
R. mooreanus in open grasslands.” Logsdon (1967:69) found these estivating on fence posts, on
dead weeds in an open field, and under leaf litter in Kaufman County. Although Rabdotus tend to
be colonial, according to Pratt (1974:25), the two species never occur together at the same locality.
Shell height and diameter were measured both for adults and for any juveniles large enough to be
retained on the quarter-inch field screen in Unit 13 (Figures K-1 and K-2). Individuals classed as
adult had a mean shell height of 22.63 ± 3.04 mm (range, 16.80–32.60 mm; n = 328) for all of the
levels (2.82–5.0 mbs) aggregated together, which is well within the range of both species. The mean
diameter is 12.95 ± 1.49 mm (range, 9.50–18.20 mm; n = 396); mean diameter/height ratio is 0.57
± 0.03 (range, 0.48–0.68; n = 311). Many juveniles and some adults in the 4.9–5.0 mbs level have
faint to moderate irregular light brown banding, as well as occasional specimens in levels as high
as 4.3 mbs. Specimens above this level are bleached. It is unclear whether this banding represents
the original coloration, or differential iron staining on growth segments of the shell, but in any
case this banding is characteristic of Rabdotus dealbatus rather than R. mooreanus. Although only a
small proportion of the shells are banded, the interpretation preferred here is that most or all of the
Rabdotus are probably R. dealbatus.
Rabdotus is the most abundant taxon for the snail column as a whole, chiefly due to the large numbers
of juveniles present in both the No. 10 and the No. 18 sieve fractions. In the Unit 13 sample, the
ratio of adults to juveniles is fairly low at the bottom of the section, increasing upsection to a peak at
3.8–3.9 mbs, then declining above that level (Table K-2, Figure K-3). The long-term trend suggests
decreasing juvenile mortality. In general, the proportions suggest the highest juvenile mortality for
Rabdotus was in the Allerod, Younger Dryas. A plot of mean shell height by depth for adults only
(see Figure K-1) shows essentially the same trend, including a peak for shell height at 3.8–3.9 mbs,
with a long-term trend toward decreasing shell height. Apparently Rabdotus survivorship improved
somewhat as the Holocene was entered, but adult size declined slightly, at least during the span of
time represented. In both the snail column and the Unit 13 sample, Rabdotus is an “increaser” (Figure
K-4); it is only moderately abundant at 4.9–5.0 mbs, then becomes much less common above that
level, until about 4.2–4.5 mbs, when it begins to increase toward the top of the section. In the preYounger Dryas samples from the auger tests, it is uncommon and only represents about 0.5 percent of
the terrestrial snails. Rabdotus dealbatus is regarded here as a fairly arid-tolerant species indicative
of brushy or open woodland habitat, but not closed canopy forest. Adults and juveniles are shown in
Figures K-5 and K-6 A–C.

Depth (mbs)

This very small, discoidal, problematic species
is the second most abundant taxon in the snail
column (Figure K-6 F–H). It has no truly diagnostic
characters and is very difficult to separate from
the unrelated species Helicodiscus singleyanus.
According to Theler et al. (2004:10), it can be
distinguished from H. singleyanus by “the slightly
higher spires covered with distinct striae on the
upper shell surface.” The Vara Daniel specimens
have striae, but not on the apex. This species is
reported to have a diameter of about 2.0–2.8 mm
(Burch 1962:106); the Vara Daniel specimens
most often range about 1.2–2.3 mm (maximum
range, 1.1–2.8 mm). Both species tend to trap
air and float well and can easily be introduced
by flooding. There is conflicting information
about habitat preference, perhaps because it has
often been misidentified. According to Neck
(1994:149), it occurs in “mesic canyon woodlands
with deep leaf litter,” but Hubricht (1985:29) says
it is “a species of bare ground. I have never found
it in leaf litter.” A review of habitat preference
can be found in Brown (2006:1064–1065). Most
authorities seem to indicate that while it prefers

wooded areas with leaf litter, it can easily tolerate drier situations such as open grassland (Basch et al.
1961:196). In Kentucky, it was found “in thin soil and leaf litter around limestone outcrops” (Dourson
and Freeman 2006:13); in Tennessee, it was also associated with leaf litter (Coney et al. 1982:90). This
was the fourth most common species in the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey, where it was found in
rock ledges and under downed wood in riparian woodland (Wyckoff et al. 1997:35). It is regarded here
as a eurytopic, arid-tolerant species.

This species shows conspicuous fluctuations in abundance over time; it is moderately abundant in
the auger test samples, becomes scarce at 4.9–5.0 mbs, increases to a peak at 4.3–4.5 mbs, then again
becomes less common. Its abundance seems to be partly correlated to that of the amphibious and
aquatic snails, which may indicate it is a “floater,” introduced at least in part by floodwaters. If that is
the case, it may not be representative of on-site habitat.

Appendix K Snail Species Accounts

Pupoides albilabris Adults and cf. Pupoides albilabris Juveniles
This small, conical snail is arid-tolerant and widespread across the eastern US, the plains states, and
into the Rocky Mountain region and northern Mexico. It was the single most commonly encountered
species in the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey (Wyckoff et al. 1997:32), occurring in low numbers
but high ubiquity on all landform types. According to Cheatum and Fullington (1973:28), it is “most
abundant in limestone areas where it may be found under rocks, in grass roots and under leaf litter in
sparse woodlands.” This is another eurytopic species capable of tolerating wide extremes in moisture
and temperature (it also extends from Maine to Florida), and it apparently thrives in the harsh continental
climate of the plains states. According to Wyckoff et al. (1997:32), it is infrequent in moist, sheltered
woodlands.
This species is a “decreaser”; in the snail column, it is most abundant below about 4.3 mbs, becoming
somewhat uncommon above that point except for a few small increases in the upper half of the section.
In addition to the adults (Figure K-6 O and P) with their distinctive flanged peristomes, the No. 18
mesh samples contain small, light brown, edentulous, conical juvenile pupillids that look like smaller
versions of Pupoides albilabris, but without a reinforced peristome. I have tabulated these separately as
likely juvenile Pupoides, based chiefly on size, degree of taper, and color.

Gastrocopta procera
This species is somewhat similar to Pupoides albilabris in geographic distribution (Couri 1976:Figure
1) and habitat preference, and may be found with it (Figure K-6 K–N). It is often found in woodland
and in leaf litter, but may occur both in riparian and drier upland woodland. In the Southern Plains
Gastropod Survey, this was the second most common species, and almost 4800 specimens were
collected. It was abundant in rock ledges and toeslopes (Wyckoff et al. 1997:32) and is uncommon in
moist habitats. In Kansas, Basch et al. (1961:193) remark that it is “commonly found in dry conditions
on the open prairie, and was frequently associated with Pupoides albilabris.” Along with Pupoides
albilabris, Gastrocopta cristata, G. pellucida, and H. inermis, Neck (1990:14) found it characteristic of
“upland, well-drained microhabitats that represent the most extreme xeric conditions that are tolerated
by terrestrial gastropods in the Texas Panhandle.” This is another eurytopic, arid-tolerant, dry woodland
or grassland species, and it may be or may not one of the few species that is temperature-sensitive.
Baerreis (1980:108–109) suggests it may be limited to areas with a growing season of at least 160 frostfree days. Couri (1976) studied 14 lots of this species (346 specimens) obtained from various places
scattered throughout its range, from Texas (Dundee in Archer County and Comfort in Kendall County)
to Kansas to Maryland. He found the size and the morphology of the shell to be correlated with some
climatic factors, but not others. Of most interest here are the positive correlation of shell height with
average annual temperature (r = 0.737) and average date of first killing frost (r = 0.571) and negative
correlation with average depth of frost penetration (r = -0.975) and average summer precipitation
(r = -0.774). The number of whorls that could be counted on the shell was correlated positively with
the annual number of frost-free days (r = 0.694) and average annual temperature (r = 0.819), among
other things (Couri 1976:Table 12). The largest specimens in his study collection were the ones from
Comfort, Texas. Since Couri did not list his climatic data (which cover the period 1899–1938) or any
regression equations, I tried to replicate his analysis for shell height using more recent climatic data
from individual stations, rather than interpolating between isotherms as he did. Probably as a result of
this difference in procedure, I obtained a much lower correlation between shell height and mean annual
temperature. Regression analysis shows a positive correlation, but with a wide scatter of data points

around the regression line. The r² value obtained was only 0.24, suggesting height does not have much
predictive value for annual temperature. More recently Nekola and Coles (2001) revisited the question
of clinal variation and found that about 38 percent of shell size variation can be explained by the
latitude of the G. procera population—in short, larger shells are found in more southern populations.
In the snail column and in the upper two auger test samples studied, Gastrocopta procera appears to
be a decreaser. It is more abundant in the lower part of the excavations (from about 4.6 to 6.2 mbs,
and especially at 4.8–5.8 mbs), becoming progressively less common moving upsection. Despite its
tolerance for aridity and other climatic extremes, this species apparently did not thrive as well in the
Holocene as in the Younger Dryas and earlier, possibly as a result of the advent of Plains northers
unleashed by the retraction of the Laurentide ice sheet.

Strobilops texasiana Adults and Juveniles
This small, beehive-shaped species is distinctive and easy to recognize, but in levels with high carbonate
content, the ribbed shells acquire a carbonate coating that makes them look like small pebbles. Extra
care had to be taken while picking these levels (especially in the auger tests) to avoid missing any. This
is one of the few species in the Vara Daniel collection that is a good indicator of leaf litter and downed
wood. It is often found under rotten logs or in leaf litter drift. At the Preiss Ranch in Goliad County,
I found this species in well-drained, fairly xeric oak motts similar to those in Zilker Park west and
northwest of the EComm excavation area.
Adults (Figure K-7 A–D) and juveniles (Figure K-7 E–G) intergrade, and the division between them
is arbitrary. Adults have light brown or beige upper and lower surfaces, a thickened peristome, and
strong upper ribbing that sometimes extends partway onto the basal surface. Juveniles have white basal
surfaces, smooth with no ribbing. Older juveniles have ribbing on the upper surface only; younger ones
have none on either surface and may be white on top and bottom. The umbilicus is more prominent in
juveniles and closes up as the individual matures. Adults often split in half along one of the sutures, but
the distinctive basal sections can easily be recognized and counted.
In the snail column, this species is a decreaser similar to Gastrocopta procera. It is very abundant in the
auger test samples, variably abundant in the lower part of the column up to about 4.4 mbs, and relatively
uncommon above that depth. Presumably this indicates a reduction in on-site leaf litter and downed
wood as sediments accumulated above the 4.4 mbs depth. It is far more abundant at the 5.2 mbs and
5.6–5.8 mbs levels than anywhere else in the column.

Praticolella cf. P. pachyloma Adults, Praticolella cf. P. berlandieriana
Adults, Praticolella sp. Adults, and cf. Praticolella sp. Juveniles
Praticolella is a genus of medium-bodied polygyrid land snails, relatively well-defined thanks to a
definitive study of Texas species done by Hubricht (1983). The common name for P. pachyloma is
sandyland scrubsnail, referring to their occurrence in brushy habitat. Despite their size, they are rather
fragile, and many of them probably do not survive the quarter-inch field screen except as fragments.
Nevertheless, most of the specimens complete enough for measurement or shape analysis come from
the Unit 13 field screen. Praticolella fragments were found in most levels of the snail column, but
few intact specimens were recovered. Hubricht (1983:Map 4) reports only P. berlandieriana in Travis
County, but with P. pachyloma occurring to the east. Neck (1994:150) reports both P. berlandieriana

Of the two species, Praticolella berlandieriana is relatively shorter and wider, with a gray band around
the terminal whorl (Hubricht 1983:Figure 10; Cheatum and Fullington 1971:Plate III, Figures 3, 4).
P. pachyloma is relatively taller and lacks banding (Hubricht 1983:Figure 4; Cheatum and Fullington
1971:Plate III, Figure 5; Plate V, Figure 1; see also Brown 2006:Table 8.15).

The Praticolella specimens as a whole from the EComm excavations seem to resemble P. pachyloma
more than P. berlandieriana, which is perhaps not surprising since they were recovered from a sandy
alluvial terrace. For the Unit 13 and snail column specimens combined, the mean shell height is 7.27
± 0.73 mm (range, 6.2–8.9 mm, n = 56). The mean shell diameter is 9.66 ± 0.94 mm (range, 8.2–11.5 mm,
n = 58). The mean height/diameter ratio is 0.7575 ± 0.0348 (range, 0.6727–0.8778, n = 53). Specimens
from Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs) have a mean shell height of 6.95 ± 0.70 mm (range, 5.9–8.7 mm, n =33);
mean shell diameter is 8.90 ± 0.83 mm (range 6.4–11.6 mm, n = 37). In size, the Vara Daniel specimens
are more or less intermediate between the two species, but in shape, most of them are closer to P.
pachyloma (see Brown 2006:Figure 8.51). A single specimen from the 3.1–3.2 mbs level is banded,
but all the rest are bleached white, which could either be due to the normal loss of pigmentation in
archaeological shells, or could indicate they are all P. pachyloma. Only five or so of the specimens
were close enough morphologically to P. pachylomato allow confident species assignment (Figure K-8
A and B).
The evidence suggests that most or all of these are P. pachyloma, but I have simply listed most of
them as Praticolella sp. (Figure K-9 C–H) in recognition of the fact that they may include occasional
examples of P. berlandieriana. Raymond Neck has recognized both species co-occurring at some
archaeological sites in Fort Bend County. Speaking of P. pachyloma, Hubricht (1983:246) says, “to
hybrids it contributed its more globose shape, its narrow supraperipheral band, and a reduction in the
white pigment, and above all, its tolerance of dry habitats….” Hubricht maintained that Praticolella
species would frequently hybridize, although more recent DNA analysis disputes this. In addition to
the adults, there are a number of smaller, thinner shells, without thickened peristomes, that I take to be
Praticolella juveniles (Figure K-9 I and J). These, of course, cannot be speciated.
Accurately assessing the stratigraphic distribution of Praticolella is hampered by its propensity for
breakage, but in both Unit 13 and the column sample, it seems to be more common near the base of
the excavations, from about 4.6 mbs down to 5.4 mbs in the auger tests. It is scarce in the lowest auger
sample examined, at 6.0–6.2 mbs, except for small fragments in the No. 18 mesh sieve. A very slight
increase in frequency is seen at the 3.1–3.6 mbs level. In general, the genus is a decreaser, but is never
very abundant.

Oligyra orbiculata (Figure K-8 Y and Z) is probably the most common species of snail seen lying
about on the ground today in Central and South Texas. When field screens with ⅛-inch mesh are used,
thousands can sometimes be recovered from Late Holocene archaeological deposits. Elsewhere (Brown
2002:263–264; 2006:1082) I have discussed this “Late Holocene Oligyra population explosion.” In the
Vara Daniel excavations, this species occurs only in low frequency near the base of the excavations
and is rare to absent above that. Adult Oligyra are sized such that about half of them will typically fall
through a ¼-inch field screen and be lost. In Unit 13, Oligyra appears only below 4.3 mbs, and the
22 recovered from the 4.9–5.0 mbs level represent the largest count. The heavily thickened peristome
tends to survive even when the shell is crushed, so MNI counts can be derived from broken shells. In
the column sample, there are scattered occurrences of this species down to 4.3 mbs, where it becomes
somewhat more common; the highest count is an MNI of 35 in the 4.9–5.0 mbs level.
The scarcity of this species in the EComm excavations is striking, and seemingly at odds with the
presence of other drought-tolerant species. Its abundance at other Paleoindian sites is quite variable. At
the Aubrey site, it is very rare; at Pavo Real and Richard Beene, it occurs in modest quantities; at the

(see discussion in Brown 2006:1082–1084).

This species is interpreted as a cosmopolitan, eurytopic, drought-resistant snail that can tolerate both
wet and dry conditions, and is well adapted to continental Holocene climates (see Brown 2006:Figure
8.13). It may indicate the presence of open xerithermic habitats. It is an operculate species, and the
operculum helps it estivate in drought. The opercula were recovered from the snail column in the No.
18 mesh sieve, and their frequency distribution mirrors that of the shells (Table K-3)

It is often found in deciduous or juniper woodlands, but is also frequent
in open habitat with mixed grass and scattered small shrubs. I have seen
it in abundance in whitebrush thickets in South Texas. It is semi-arboreal
and will climb shrubs, trees, or rocks, especially to escape heavy rain.
This calciphile tropical species does not extend into the Southern Plains
or Central Plains, and was not recovered in Oklahoma by the Southern
Plains Gastropod Survey; in Texas, its westward extension stops in
the Rolling Plains (Fullington and Pratt:1974:Figure 1). Whether it is
limited on the west by open grassland, lack of calcium, or killing frosts
is unclear.

Table K-3. Oligyra
orbiculata Opercula by
Level in Column Sample.

Gastrocopta contracta
This small pupillid is a mesic-adapted species often found in wooded
floodplains, in moist shaded areas, and may be found under leaf litter or
rotten logs. Because of its small size, distinctive V-shaped aperture, and
characteristic white color that contrasts with the beige of many of the
other pupillids, it is rather easily recognized (Figure K-6 D and E, I and J).
It is an eastern US species (Brown 2006:Figure 8.6) whose western limit
corresponds to the September 5-inch mean total precipitation isohyet.
In the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey extending across Oklahoma,
it was found only at the eastern end of the transect, where there was
at least 32–35 inches of annual rainfall (Wyckoff et al. 1997:37). This
species is relatively uncommon in the column sample, where only
42 were recovered. By comparison, in the bench deposits at Berger
Bluff, 347 were recovered in the two column samples, with another
90 fortuitously recovered from the field screens (Brown 2006:1047).
Baerreis (1980:117) used this species to reconstruct annual precipitation
at the Cherokee Sewer site in Iowa. Curiously, shell height was found
to be negatively correlated with temperature and precipitation variables
(r = -0.567 for height vs. annual precipitation).

In the Vara Daniel column sample, this species appears as a minor component throughout the section,
with no more than five examples in any one level. In the auger tests, 28 occur in the 5.6–5.8 mbs
sample, with eight in the other two, possibly suggesting wetter conditions below 5.2 mbs.

Polygyra texasiana, cf. Polygyra sp. Juveniles, Unidentified
Polygyridae, and cf. Polygyridae? Juveniles
Because these are medium-sized snails, intact adult examples of Polygyra texasiana (Cheatum and
Fullington 1971:Plate I, Figure 3) or Millerelix mooreana (three and two, respectively) are uncommon
in the column sample. Instead, most of the specimens available for study came from the field screen
in Unit 13. These species are often recovered in modest numbers on the ¼-inch screen when Archaic
or Late Prehistoric archaeological deposits are excavated, but even in the Unit 13 sample they are not
particularly abundant; 34 P. texasiana adults and one juvenile were recovered, along with two more
Millerelix mooreana. In the sieved samples from the snail column, these species most often appear as

small aperture or body fragments; these could be either Polygyra or Millerelix, but are more likely to be
Polygyra because most intact specimens belong to this genus. There are also juvenile shells, edentulous
and lacking thickened peristomes, that I take to be juvenile Polygyra.
The P. texasiana specimens (Figure K-8 O–V, X, X’) from Unit 13 (all levels combined) have a mean
diameter of 9.36 ± 0.66 mm (range, 8.0–10.8 mm; n = 32), a mean height of 4.93 ± 0.42 mm (range,
4.3–5.6; n = 32), and height/diameter ratio of 0.53 ± 0.03 (range, 0.47–0.63; n = 32). The diameter
is consistent with Polygyra texasiana texasiana as defined by Pratt (1981:61), although the height/
diameter ratio is not as flat and is actually closer to Millerelix mooreana. The Vara Daniel specimens
seem to correspond best to Polygyra texasiana texasiana. P. texasiana is found throughout the central
and eastern part of Texas “in the valleys between hills and on the floodplains of small streams, generally
in grasslands or open woodlands, on calcareous substrates. It is replaced, on slopes and hilltops, by
Millerelix mooreana….” (Pratt 1981:69). Cheatum and Fullington (1971:12) list “habitats ranging from
deep woodlands to open prairies, where it may be found under rocks and other objects. During drouth,
well-formed epiphragms may be present that seal the aperture, thus preventing water loss.” Logsdon
(1967:74) found this species widespread in almost every habitat where he collected in Kaufman County.
In both the Unit 13 and column sample, most of the relatively few P. texasiana recovered are scattered
in small numbers toward the top of the section. This is one of the few species that seems to become
slightly more common later in time, but they are nevertheless not as abundant as at many other sites.
In the bench deposits at Berger Bluff, over a thousand examples of the triodontoides subspecies were
recovered (Brown 2006:1087).

Millerelix mooreana
Two examples of Millerelix mooreana (Figure K-8 L, W) were found in Unit 13 at 4.3–4.4 and 4.4–4.5
mbs, with two more in the column sample at 3.7–3.8 mbs; diameters are 7.3, 7.5, 7.6 and 8.1 mm.
These are smaller and more tightly coiled than P. texasiana. According to Pratt (1981:31), it “inhabits
rocky slopes, generally in oak of oak-juniper woodland, and always on a calcareous substrate…. It is
absent from dry hilltops and seems to be replaced by Polygyra texasiana on valley floors and stream
floodplains.”

Glyphyalinia umbilicata
Glyphyalinia umbilicata (Figure K-7 I, I’, J and K) is the more abundant of the two Glyphyalinia species
at the site, recognized by its tightly closed umbilicus and spoke-like impressed lines on the upper
surface. These are fragile shells, and may be underrepresented. It has a confused taxonomic history (see
Brown 2006:1058–1060). Most sources seem to indicate this is a mesic-adapted snail, usually found
under leaf litter and rotten logs in floodplain woodland (Coney et al. 1982:94). Both Glyphyalinia
umbilicata and G. roemeri can be found in crevices on talus slopes (personal observation).
This species is relatively uncommon in the snail column; the largest frequencies are found at 4.2–4.6
mbs, in a zone with increased frequencies of amphibious and aquatic snails. This might indicate they
are floaters introduced by floodwaters, and not representative of the on-site habitat. In the auger test
samples examined, this species appears only in the 5.6–5.8 mbs sample.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Appendix K Snail Species Accounts

cf. Glyphyalinia roemeri juveniles
All examples of this species seem too small to be adults (Figure K-7 L, L’), although there is no clear
division between adults and subadults. This species has a much wider umbilicus than G. umbilicata,
and lacks the spoke-like impressed lines. It could conceivably be confused with Zonitoides arboreus.
According to Hubricht (1985:23–24), the species is “found under rocks and in moist leaves on wooded
talus slopes, in ravines, and in caves.” In Travis County, Neck (1994:149) lists the preferred habitat
as caves and wet areas. This species is thinly scattered throughout the snail column and auger tests,
although five examples were found in the 4.3–4.4 mbs sample. These may also be floaters.

Gastrocopta armifera
This arid-tolerant pupillid is the largest Gastrocopta in Texas (Figure K-9 A and B), and is found
irregularly scattered west of the Balcones Escarpment. In North America, it has a widespread but spotty
distribution, extending northward as far as Ontario to the east and Alaska to the west. It is found in
calcareous areas under rocks, leaf litter, or rotting logs, on wooded slopes. In Ellis County, Cheatum
and Burt (1931:336) found living specimens under leaves. Although it seems to have an affinity for
wooded areas, it is also found in open areas. In the Texas Panhandle, Neck (1990:13) found it in a xeric
area with no leaf litter, and in the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey, it was found at the east end of the
transect in rock ledges (Wyckoff et al. 1997:37). This was the most common species in an inventory of
xeric hill prairies in Wisconsin by Theler (1997:Table 4), where it occurred in open areas with grasses
and forbs. It has also frequently been recovered from Pleistocene deposits in the Plains. It is said to be
a eurytopic species, able to estivate in drought conditions.
This species is fairly robust, and can also frequently be recognized from basal fragments. It is more
abundant in the auger test samples than elsewhere, and seems to be entirely absent above 3.8 mbs; 16
were found in the column sample, and another 24 in the auger tests examined.

Unidentified Slug Plates
Slugs are terrestrial snails that have lost their external shell through the evolutionary process, but still
have a calcareous internal vestigial shell that can be preserved in sediments even when the soft parts
have long since decayed (Figure K-10 A–G). Slug plates are very small (the ones from the Vara Daniel
samples average only 2.95 mm in length and 1.61 mm in width), much smaller than the living animal
itself. Slug plates resemble very small split quartz pebbles or even small pressure flakes, and they
are very easy to overlook when picking sediment samples. I suspect many are overlooked even by
experienced archaeomalacologists. At the Wilson-Leonard site, none were found in the TARL samples
examined by Raymond Neck, and only one (Deroceras laeve) was found in the feature samples
examined by James Theler (Shaw et al. 1998:Table 37-11). Careful picking of the Vara Daniel samples
produced 28 examples from the snail column and auger tests. Many of these have partial carbonate
encrustations, but on the cleanest examples, the laminar growth layers can clearly be seen. Most have a
constriction at one end that resembles a small bulb of percussion, and this is another reason they might
be mistaken for chert microflakes.
There are three living native slugs in Texas, and plates from a fourth species, the extinct giant slug
Deroceras aenigma, are often found in Pleistocene deposits in Texas (see Neck 2007:Table 5.4) and
elsewhere in the Plains. Deroceras laeve is a common contemporary native species, and it seems possible
that most of the slug plates might belong to this species. According to Taylor (1954:6), Deroceras

Probably none of the Vara Daniel slug plates are

aenigma (the largest, from 5.6–5.8 mbs, measures
4.0 by 2.0 mm), but many are large enough
to qualify as juveniles under Taylor’s criteria
(Table K-4). Without access to good comparative
material, the classification cannot be solidified. For
the column sample and auger samples combined,
the mean length of the slug plates is 2.95 ± 0.48
mm (range, 1.8–4.0 mm; n = 24); mean width is

necessarily of mesic regional climates. In the
Southern Plains Gastropod Survey running across
the Oklahoma plains, Deroceras laeve ranked 14
out of 23 in number of occurrences in assemblages (but accounted for only 22 specimens out of almost
20,000; Wyckoff et al. 1997:Table 9). Slug plates have been recovered from archaeological sediments
in otherwise arid environments such as the Folsom site (Meltzer 2006:Table 6.8, 6.9) and Lubbock lake
(Pierce 1987:Table 6.1), and slugs can be found in moist microhabitats embedded in the contemporary

Recovery of slug plates in Quaternary sites is probably very uneven, because they are truly difficult to

test samples represent a high density or a low density. Except for the 5.2–5.4 mbs level in Auger Test
3, which had six specimens, no level had more than three specimens. They appear to be slightly more
common in the lower levels of the excavation.

Vallonia sp.
According to Fullington and Pratt (1974:28),
Valloniids are generally found associated with moist, shaded situations. The several
species which are native to Texas occur in relictal mesic habitats usually associated
with limestone in the Trans-Pecos region and in canyons in the escarpment of the High
Plains. During the Pleistocene the genus seems to have been generally distributed
over northern and western Texas, indicative of a somewhat cooler and wetter climate.
Fullington and Pratt report five species from Texas, one of them present only as Pleistocene fossils. They
indicate a single literature report for Vallonia gracilicosta from Bell County (Fullington and Pratt:1974);
otherwise, they report no living specimens in Central Texas. As mapped by Hubricht (1985:Maps 26–31,
33) most living Vallonia populations except for V. perspectiva and V. parvula are found chiefly in the
northern part of the US. The Vara Daniel species (Figure K-9 D–I’) cannot be speciated, in part due to
lack of comparative material, but this appears to be a Pleistocene taxon that was extirpated in Central
Texas sometime early in the Holocene, and its distribution in the EComm excavations supports that
interpretation. Twenty specimens were recovered from the auger tests, 18 of them from the 5.6–5.8 mbs
sample, and only three in the column sample: one each at 4.3–4.4 mbs, 4.5–4.6 mbs, and 4.6–4.7 mbs.
The 4.3 mbs level presumably represents the point at which the genus became locally extirpated. The
Vara Daniel specimens rather uniformly measure 1.9–2.0 mm in diameter, which would be consistent
with V. parvula or V. perspectiva.
In the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey, Vallonia parvula was the only species of Vallonia recovered,
and it occurred in its highest density in wooded dunes, but was nearly absent from adjacent prairie
(Wyckoff et al. 1997:36).

Anguispira strongylodes Juveniles
Three examples of this species were found in the auger tests (one at 5.2–5.4 mbs and two at 5.6–5.8
mbs) and one in the column sample (at 4.7–4.8 mbs), but all were very small juveniles found in the No.
10 sieve fraction (Figure K-9 J, K). These measured 4.4, 3.0, 4.2, and 4.2 mm in diameter, respectively.
Newly hatched Anguispira alternata (a closely related species) measure about 2 mm, so these are
very young individuals. Another example was found in Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs). No adults or fragments
of adults were recovered in Unit 13 or any of the other samples. Adults of this species are largebodied (specimens from the bench deposits measured about 13.0–19.7 mm in diameter). This is an
eastern US species that extends into the eastern and southern part of Texas (Hubricht 1985:Map 159).
These snails are normally found in deciduous woodland. Neck (1994:148) lists the habitat as “riparian
woodlands in eastern part of county.” Habitat preferences are probably similar to Anguispira alternata,
about which much more is known; if so, this snail can be regarded as an indicator of well-developed
deciduous woodland with decaying, downed wood. The scarcity of this species and the absence of
adults is unanticipated and somewhat surprising. For a much more extensive discussion of this species,
see Brown (2006:95–100).

Euconulus cf. E. trochulus
One example of this taxon was found in the column sample (at 3.5–3.6 mbs; Figure K-9 C, C’), two
were found in Auger Test 5 (at 5.6–5.8 mbs), and one in Auger Test 4 (at 6.0–6.2 mbs). Two closely
similar species of Euconulus are found in Texas—Euconulus fulvus and E. trochulus. According to
Hubricht, E. fulvus is a chiefly northeastern US species that occurs as living populations in Texas
only in the Trans-Pecos (Hubricht 1985:Map 331), while E. trochulus is an eastern US species found
mainly in the eastern part of Texas (Hubricht 1985:Map 332). Pilsbry (1946:242) listed this species as
Euconulus chersinus trochulus, and reported specimens from Bastrop County and Travis County, along
with several other counties. This species is found in moist leaf litter in shaded habitats. Surprisingly,
Neck (1990) reported it from the Texas panhandle, but only in moist microhabitats (seeps, stream
banks, floodplains; localities 1, 3, 7 and 12). In Travis County, the habitat is listed as riparian woodland
(Neck 1994:149). The Vara Daniel examples are thought most likely to be Euconulus trochulus partly
on the basis of morphology, and partly on the basis of contemporary geographic distribution.

Gastrocopta pentodon
Only two specimens of this species came from the column sample (at 4.0–4.1 and 4.2–4.3 mbs; Figure
K-7 M), plus a possible fragment from an auger test sample at 6.0–6.2 mbs. This species is very difficult
to separate from Gastrocopta tappaniana. It is a eurytopic, dry woodland or grassland species. According
to Cheatum and Fullington (1973:20), it is “a snail of well-drained woodland areas and of meadows
associated with sparse vegetation, leaf litter and other objects serve as cover.” It is widely distributed
through the Trans-Pecos and eastern part of the state and is also widely found as a Pleistocene fossil.

Helicodiscus parallelus Juveniles
Two specimens were found in the column sample, one at 4.4–4.5 mbs and one at 4.5–4.6 mbs (Figure
K-7 H, H’). This is chiefly an eastern US species. According to Hubricht (1985:21, Map 185), “found
on floodplains, as well as upland woods, in leaf litter….” In the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey,
this species was ranked seventh out of 23 in occurrence, and was found in rock ledges and riparian
woodlands. It was much more abundant at the more mesic eastern end of the transect, and except for one
locality, was mostly absent at the drier New Mexico-western Oklahoma end of the transect (Wyckoff
et al. 1997:Table 8). Two of the Vara Daniel specimens were found in the same levels that produced
increased numbers of amphibious and aquatic snails, suggesting they were possibly introduced by
floodwaters.

Gastrocopta cf. G. tappaniana?
A single specimen that may be Gastrocopta tappaniana was found in Auger Test 5 (5.6–5.8 mbs;
Figure K-10 H). This species is difficult to discriminate from Gastrocopta pentodon. The specimen has
a height of 2.0 mm and diameter of 1.1 mm or over. The basal whorl is 1.2 mm or more high, or more
than 60 percent of the height. The shell is white and oval in shape. It is classified as G. tappaniana
rather than G. pentodon on the basis of greater size, broader shape, and basal whorl greater than 60
percent of height. According to Cheatum and Fullington (1973:23), “Its preferred habitat seems to be on
woodland slopes adjacent to streams or other bodies of water.” This species is a mesic indicator, found
in wet areas, pond margins, marshes, or under logs and debris on moist floodplains or upland forests. It
is scarce in Texas both in archaeological sediments and as a live species.

Gastrocopta cf. G. cristata
A single specimen found in the column sample at 4.0–4.1 mbs is thought to be a possible example of
Gastrocopta cristata (Figure K-7 N). It is slightly larger than Gastrocopta procera (height, 2.7 mm;
diameter, 1.1 mm) and the shell is pure white instead of light brown. The anguloparietal lamella is not
bifid; see Pilsbry (1948:Figures 10, 11). Cheatum and Fullington (1973:14) describe this species as
“highly adaptable to semi-arid regions of the Southwest. It occurs in upland grasslands, timbered slopes
and also in areas subject to inundation.” Neck (1994:147) says “western upland areas…under rocks in
juniper brakes.” In the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey, this species was ranked 15th. The principal
habitats were riparian woodlands, with fewer individuals in pastures and fewer still in dunes; it did not
occur in rock ledges.

Pupilla cf. P. muscorum (?)
One specimen was found in Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs, No. 25 sieve; Figure K-11 G) and 10 specimens were
found in the auger tests (9 in Auger Test 5, 5.6–5.8 mbs; one in Auger Test 4, 6.0–6.2 mbs; Figure K-11
H). Curiously, Cheatum and Fullington (1973:25) state “In all probability P. muscorum should not be
reported as Recent for Texas.” Neck (1994:147) says “Isolated record in Colorado River floodplain.”
Hubricht (1985:Map 35) shows only living populations in the northeastern US, with fossil occurrences
only in the Plains. Yet the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey found living populations in Oklahoma
and New Mexico. Wyckoff et al. (1997:38) add “This species, like Vallonia gracilicosta, represents
a species with disjunct relict populations on the southwestern margin of the Great Plains. Pupilla
muscorum is characteristically a cool climate taxa (sic) often found in assemblages deposited on the
Southern Plains during the cooler phases of the Pleistocene.” This species occurred exclusively in rock
ledges and was absent from riparian woodlands, pastures, and other habitats (Wyckoff et al. 1997:Table
10). Hubricht (1985:7) lists it as “A calciphile. A species of grassy roadsides and meadows.” Since this
species occurs only below 5.6 mbs in the EComm excavations, it presumably represents a Pleistocene
species that was locally extirpated early, perhaps before the Younger Dryas. The cryptic reference by
Neck (1994) is problematic.
Pupilla muscorum is also found in the Old World and is very often recovered by archaeomalacologists
in the UK and mainland Europe. According to Davies (2008:175) it is “usually a xerophile, common
wherever there is high exposure and lack of shade; very short-turved grassland, dune grasslands, walls
and scree. Also, however, occasionally found in floodplain environments….”

Cochlicopa lubricella
This species may be listed in the older literature as Cionella lubricella or may have been included
in Cionella lubrica. Like P. muscorum, it is a Holarctic species common in the Old World. It is a
microsnail, but a fairly large and distinctive one, large enough to be captured on the No. 10 sieve (Figure
K-11 A–F). According to Fullington and Pratt (1974:19), living populations are known from the Chisos,
Davis, and Guadalupe Mountains. Their map (Fullington and Pratt 1974:Figure 8) shows scattered
occurrences in Central Texas, including Bell County and Comal County, but they do not discuss these.
Hubricht (1985:Map 22) shows only fossil and drift finds in Texas. The related species Cochlicopa
lubrica was recovered by the Southern Plains Gastropods Survey in rock ledges, riparian woodland,
and mountaintop habitats. According to Hubricht (1985:6) both species are “found in meadows and
along roadsides, a species of moderately wet grassy situations.” Judging by its northerly and highaltitude range, it is perhaps a cool-climate species. Davies (2008:174) says “Catholic, but generally in
drier places than C. lubrica.” Neck (1987:314) says “”typical habitats vary from pond edges to montane
canyons but generally are moist with substantial amounts of leaf litter….”
A dozen specimens were recovered from two of the auger tests. None were found in the column sample
or the Unit 9 sample. Ten specimens came from Auger Test 5 (5.6–5.8 mbs) and two came from Auger
Test 4 (6.0–6.2 mbs). Like Pupilla muscorum, this is probably a Pleistocene marker species that was
locally extirpated quite early, perhaps before the Younger Dryas. Both seem to be Holarctic species that
favor cool climates and may have largely withdrawn northward or to higher altitude refugia during the
Holocene.
I am aware of no previous reports of this species from Texas archaeological sites except for the Lake
Theo site in Briscoe County (Neck 1987). It is not reported for the Aubrey, Wilson-Leonard, Lubbock

Lake, Rex Rodgers, Mustang Springs, Richard Beene, Winston’s Cave, or Berger Bluff sites, or for
Bonfire Shelter — all early sites sampled for microsnails. It is not listed for any of the Llano Estacado
paleoenvironmental sites reported by Drake (1975), nor for the Burnham and Hajny Mammoth sites
in Oklahoma. Cochlicopa (Cionella) lubrica has been reported for the Folsom site (New Mexico), the
Domebo site (Oklahoma), and the Hudson-Meng site (Nebraska), however. It is also occasionally found
in Pleistocene paleontological sites in Texas.

Amphibious Snails
Most of the amphibious and aquatic snails from the Vara Daniel site can only be identified to the family
level, because of taxonomic confusion and ecophenetic plasticity. Some of the specimens show strong
resemblances to previously described species, however, and this will be noted below. Adding to the
difficulty of identification is the fact that nearly all are juveniles, and juveniles are much more difficult
to assign to species than adults.

Succineidae, cf. Catinella vermeta Juvenile and
Unidentified Succineidae Juveniles
The Succineidae are a common family of quasi-amphibious snails that can only be identified with
certainty by DNA analysis or dissection of soft parts. They have a great deal of ecophenetic plasticity,
meaning that shell shape varies according to local habitat. Compounding this difficulty is the fact that
all of the Vara Daniel specimens are juveniles or at most, near-adults. The largest succineids recovered
are mostly about 6.1–6.5 mm in shell height, which is well below the mean height for Catinella vermeta
(but within the range of variation for adults; Franzen 1982:Table 1). The succineids are termed “amber
snails” because of their thin, translucent shells, which may be underrepresented archaeologically.
A wide variety of names have been applied to succineids found in Texas: Succinea avara, Succinea
forsheyi, Succinea grosvenori, Succinea luteola, Succinea ovalis, Succinea solastra, Catinella avara,
Catinella texana, Catinella vermeta, Quickella vermeta. At least eight species names are in current use.
A few specimens were found that compare very well to Catinella vermeta and can be tentatively
assigned to that species (with reservations, as noted above; see Brown 2006:1123–1125). A possible
adult (height, 9.1 mm; diameter, 4.8 mm) with an acute spire and ovate aperture, well-preserved, with
various growth interruptions visible on the exterior, was found at 4.2–4.3 mbs in the column sample.
Two juveniles (heights 2.1 and 2.7 mm) were found in the 4.3–4.4 mbs level (Figure K-12 H). In the
auger test samples, possible Catinella vermeta juveniles were found at 5.2–5.4 mbs, a possible adult
(height, 8.3 mm; diameter, 4.7 mm) and nine possible juveniles (height, 1.3–6.7 mm) were found at
5.6–5.8 mbs (Figure K-12 A–G, I). Other possible Catinella vermeta juveniles were found in Unit 9
(4.9–5.0 mbs). Logsdon (1967:80) reports adults ranging in height from 7.8–14.1 mm. Other specimens
(column sample, 3.8–3.9 mbs) resemble Succinea ovalis or Succinea luteola.
I list the succineids here as amphibious sensu lato. These pulmonate snails are usually considered
taxonomically as terrestrial, but to the paleoenvironmental researcher, taxonomy is less important than
the fact that they indicate a connection to damp ground or standing water bodies. Barker (2001:74) says
The life strategy of the Succineidae is often generalized incorrectly as amphibious….
It is true that many species of Succineidae occur in marshes, swamps and at lake
margins, and are to be found on moist soil or on emergent vegetation in freshwater

systems. However, these species are strictly air-breathers and do not enter the water
actively for feeding or reproduction, although several species are known to disperse
passively attached to the surface film of water…. The family is also well represented on
the ground and arboreally both in moist environments such as rainforests and marshes
and in dry environments such as sand dunes, savannah woodlands and seasonally dry
periods in an aestivating state, with the animals retracted into the shell whose aperture
is sealed and attached to the substrate by a sheet of dried mucus, the epiphragm.

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Many of the Vara Daniel specimens are very small hatchlings (shell height for some is no more than
1.3 mm) that have much of the peristome chipped away, exposing the thicker-walled embryonic shell.
These very small, thick-walled hatchlings are distinctive but cannot be speciated. Most of the larger
juveniles also have damage to the peristome as well. About 68 percent of the succineids recovered from
the column sample and auger tests are so small that they were held on the No. 18 mesh sieve instead of
the No. 10 sieve. None were found among the sample from the field screen in Unit 13. These smallest
hatchlings are so diminutive that I suspect they may have been no more than a few weeks old when
they died. This may indicate they derived from nearby vernal pools or shallow, seasonally desiccated
water bodies. See the interpretations section for further discussion. There is no large concentration
of succineids at any level in the column sample — they are found in numbers ranging from none to
six throughout. Succineids were found in all the auger test samples examined, with ten resembling
Catinella vermeta (?) at the 5.6–5.8 mbs level. One individual with a height of K-6 mm was found in
the 6.0–6.2 mbs sample and is probably an adult.
Succineids are often found on damp, muddy ground of some kind. This may be no more than a shallow
swale on a floodplain. Despite the aridity of the Oklahoma transect as a whole, succineids ranked fifth
in recovery by the Southern Plains Gastropod Survey (487 individuals were found); they were most
abundant on toeslopes, but were found in all microhabitats surveyed except wooded dunes (Wyckoff
et al. 1997:Table 10). In Kaufman County, Logsdon (1967:80) reported Catinella vermeta “from fence
posts, where it was estivating, under leaves, under Sorghum halepense cover, and on the stems of
Cyperus setigerus, which were growing near a pond.”

cf. Pomatiposis lapidaria Juveniles
A single, well-preserved small snail from the No. 18 sieve in the 3.6–3.7 mbs column sample is one
of two examples of Pomatiopsis lapidaria in the collection (Figure K-10 I and J). The shell height is
2.4 mm and diameter, 1.4 mm, so this is perhaps a juvenile. A second example, with the spire missing,
was found in the No. 18 sieve from the 3.8–3.9 mbs sample; the remaining height is 1.8 mm, diameter
1.2 mm, also a juvenile. This prosobranch, operculate species is widely distributed in the US but is
apparently now extirpated in Texas. This species occurs in marshes, seeps, wooded floodplains, and wet
pastures, but has also been found underwater in a creek. It is colonial, can use its operculum to estivate
in dry weather, and will shift its location to stay close to damp ground (see Brown 2006:1125–1128).
According to Ameel (1938:704), very young snails can withstand only a few days of desiccation, but
adults can survive as long as two months without water. Large numbers of this species were recovered
from the pond margin at the Aubrey site (Neck 2001:Tables 7.2, 7.3) and some were also found at the
Wilson-Leonard site (Shaw et al. 1998:Table 37-6).

Aquatic Snails
Of the aquatic snails recovered from the column sample, 95 percent are pulmonates or air-breathing
snails (planorbids, 52 percent; physids, 25 percent; and lymnaeids, 18 percent). In general, these are
pond snails or stagnant water snails, able to function in poorly oxygenated water. About 5 percent
are prosobranch or gill-breathing snails; these are operculate species, more likely (but not always)
to be found in well-oxygenated running water, especially in headwater areas. The prosobranch snails
include one representative of the Hydrobiidae (Cincinnatia sp.) and one of the Pleuroceridae (Elimia
comalensis). Just as in the case of the quasi-amphibious species, most (but not all) of the aquatic snails
are small juveniles.

cf. Gyraulus parvus
This very small planorbid snail (Vara Daniel specimens range about 1.4–2.8 mm in diameter) is found
across the entire continent and is widely distributed in Texas. It can be confused with other small
planorbids like Gyraulus circumstriatus or Micromenetus dilatatus. It is found in water bodies with
dense aquatic vegetation, and often muddy bottoms. Lakes, vernal ponds, creeks, sloughs, and swamps
are represented, and it seems to prefer decayed vegetation as food. It is common in the slough and
Spring Lake at San Marcos. In drought conditions, when ponds dry up, at least partial populations have
been documented surviving for up to two months underneath algal mats (Davies 2008:22). This species
reaches full growth in about 4–5 weeks (Krull 1931:8) and spends much of its time on submerged
vegetation.
A total of 113 of these were recovered from the column sample (Figure K-13 A and B), but none were
recovered from the auger tests. Most levels have none to four specimens, but a Gyraulus-rich zone from
4.1–4.6 mbs contains almost 80 percent of the total, accompanied also by an increase in Physa.

Physa sp. Juveniles
The taxonomic history of this genus is convoluted and confusing; I have already reviewed some of it
in the “Taxonomic Uncertainty” section earlier in this chapter. The most recent DNA research seems
to indicate most Texas Physidae can be classified as Physa acuta (Wethington and Lydeard 2007).
Physa is a cosmopolitan genus with a great deal of ecophenetic plasticity. They can tolerate extreme
conditions, including very warm or very cold water, can estivate during drought, and may be found in
almost any kind of aquatic habitat, producing three generations per year. They tend to favor slow to still
water, but can be found in flowing springfed streams. Adults (classified as Haitia mexicana by Taylor
2003:Table 37) from Pecos County measured 15.97 ± 0.917 mm in height, but size is quite variable.
Experiments have shown that larger individuals survive desiccation better (Tucker et al. 1996). Water
temperature may also influence shell shape. They are preyed upon by sunfish and crawdads, which
influence both the population density and the size of the individuals.
The distribution of Physa in the sample column is essentially the same as that for Gyraulus parvus; a
concentration occurs at 4.3–4.6 mbs, but counts of none to five are found in the rest of the column. Only
one specimen occurs in the auger tests, at 5.6–5.8 mbs. All seem to be juveniles (shell height ranges
1.9–4.4 mm). Many are damaged, with spires broken off or apertures chipped (Figure K-13 C–K).
Whether this is the result of predation, stream tumbling, or post-depositional breakage is unknown.

Unidentified Lymnaeidae Juveniles (?), Lymnaeidae Juvenile
(?), cf. Fossaria obrussa, Lymnaeidae Juvenile (?), cf. Fossaria
sp., and Lymnaeidae Juvenile (?), cf. Stagnicola sp.
None of the snails in this group can be identified to the species or even the genus level with certainty. In
the column sample, there are 47 lymnaeid snails (Figure K-14 A–K), plus another four from the auger
tests (Figure K-14 L). Based on shell morphology, most resemble juveniles of Lymnaea (Fossaria)
parva, Fossaria obrussa, or Fossaria bulimoides (Harrold and Guralnick n.d.:22–23, 24–25, 32–33).
DNA sequencing shows the latter two are very closely related (Remigio 2002), so it is not surprising
that they are difficult to discriminate based on shell shape. Others resemble Fossaria cubensis or
Fossaria dalli. One juvenile specimen from the 4.1–4.2 mbs level has the more elongated, acute spire

shell shapes, making it difficult to tell how many species are present or what they might be. These seem
to be juveniles, but this assessment is provisional, since the species are unknown. The two largest have
shell heights of 8.8 and 6.0 mm, but the rest range from 1.9–4.8 mm. Jokinen (1992:47) lists a shell

reported from Comal County (Lindhom 1979), Fossaria obrussa from Bexar County (Harkrider 1982).
Aquatic habitat for lymnaeids is generally similar to that of Gyraulus and Physa. Baker (1911:19)
wrote: “The small species, like parva and humilis modicella, live on the margins of streams, ponds and
creeks, on the mud bordering the shore or on sticks, stones and various kinds of debris. These species
are seldom found in the water, unless recently submerged by a rise of the water, their natural habitat
seeming to be just above high-water mark.” Fullington (1978:130) says “lymnaeids occur in shallow
lakes, temporary ponds, sloughs, even on the wet mud adjacent to the water. They particularly seem
fond of crenon areas with abundant moss or algae.” In periods of drought, lymnaeids may estivate on or
under the soil, on the stems of reeds or cattails, on tree trunks, fallen branches, and leaf litter. Jokinen
(1978) reports that it is chiefly the juveniles which estivate.
In the column sample, the lymnaeids have a distribution similar to the other aquatic pulmonates and are
clearly associated with them. They are most common at 4.2–4.5 mbs, and are scarce in the auger tests;
none were found in the Unit 9 sample.

cf. Helisoma anceps (?) Hatchlings and Unidentified
Large-Bodied Planorbidae
Scattered through the various samples from the snail column are body wall fragments from some type
of large-bodied planorbid, much larger than the small planorbids (Gyraulus and Micromenetus) that
have been identified. These probably came from adult or near-adult Helisoma anceps or Planorbella
trivolvis, but they are far too incomplete for identification to species or genus level. We can only classify
them as “Planorbidae, large-bodied unidentified.” In addition to these, there are a few small specimens
that appear to be embryonic Helisoma anceps, based on the presence of strongly carinated whorls and
aperture shape. These have diameters ranging from 1.8–2.7 mm. Adults of this species may be as much
as 10–12 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, very young Helisoma anceps are difficult to separate from
very young Planorbella trivolvis, and likewise the protoconch segments broken out of the center of the
shell look very similar for the two species, so for some of the specimens the identification is tentative.
Where specimens with chipped apertures are concerned, it is difficult to tell how complete the shell
might be.
Examples that were thought to be embryonic Helisoma anceps were found in the column at 3.5–3.6
mbs, 4.2–4.3 mbs, and 4.3–4.4 mbs (Figure K-13 N and O). This species is fairly cosmopolitan and
can be found in flowing water, backwaters, or ponds. Fullington (1978:196) says it seems to prefer
gravelly riffles and adds “analysis of all available Texas Helisoma anceps specimens revealed that the
distribution of living populations is spotty while the fossil distribution is quite extensive and numerous.
This may be an indication that H. anceps, actually a more northern, cooler climate species, is being
extirpated from this area by current drying trends.” Reports from Kansas indicate this species is more
likely to be found in clean, running water than stagnant water (Brown 2006:1138–1139), but Lindhom
(1979:31) found it in a slough and effluent ditch, and absent from higher-current sections of the river
at San Marcos.
Body wall fragments from unidentified large-bodied planorbids are uncommon and occur sporadically
throughout the section; several are found in the 4.2–4.3 mbs level, but these could represent the
disintegration of a single individual. Only one fragment was found in the auger tests, at 5.2–5.4 mbs.

Cincinnatia sp. Juveniles
Cincinnatia is one of two genera of aquatic prosobranch snails in the collections. Fullington recognized
only one living species in Texas, Cincinnatia comalensis, but listed Cincinnatia cincinnatiensis as
“fossil, potentially recent,” and added “it will probably be found alive in streams of northeastern or
Central Texas” (Fullington 1978:37). Since then, C. cincinnatiensis has been reclassified as Cincinnatia
integra (also formerly known as Amnicola integra). Hershler and Thompson (1996:50, Figure 7) show
it as distributed across the south-central part of Texas in an irregular band from Chambers County to
Kinney County. They also list it as present at Barton Springs (National Museum of Natural History,
Smithsonian Institution, specimen 125671; Hershler and Thompson 1996:50). From this, it appears that
the Vara Daniel specimens must be either Cincinnatia comalensis or Cincinnatia integra.
There are eight examples from the column sample and one from the Unit 9 sample, all recovered from
the No. 18 sieve (none from the auger tests; Figure K-15 D–L). Of the 9 specimens, only four are
complete — the others are basal fragments. The complete specimens seem consistent with Cincinnatia
integra, but nearly all of the specimens whether complete or fragmentary appear to be subadults, and
too small for definitive identification. Hershler and Thompson (1996:37) list a height of 5.5 mm (range,
3.9–7.7 mm) and diameter/height ratio of 0.72–0.73 for C. integra. Fullington (1978:35) lists a height
of 2.9 mm and diameter of 2.0 mm for C. comalensis. Of the complete Vara Daniel specimens, all are
smaller than the adults of both species. The complete column sample specimens range in height from
1.4–2.5 mm and in diameter from 1.0–2.1 mm. The specimen from Unit 9 (4.9–5.0 mbs) is the largest
one, with a height of 4.0 mm and diameter of 3.4 mm, and it resembles C. integra specimens from
Berger Bluff (Brown 2006:Figure 8.65).
The common name for Cincinnatia integra is the Midland Siltsnail. Fullington (1978:37) says
“Cincinnatia cincinnatiensis [= integra] inhabits streams, usually with moderate to slow flow. The
substrate may be soft mud or sand-gravel, always with abundant algae and macrophytic vegetation
present… The food is chiefly diatoms.” Leonard (1959:34) says “In Lone Star lake, A. integra was
found living on mud bottom in quiet shallow water near the mouth of a small creek emptying into the
lake. In this habitat the water was somewhat turbid and contained large masses of floating and partly
submerged algae. In Shoal Creek it was found living on ooze-covered gravel bottom in clear quiet water
about one foot deep.” The species has been found on sand and gravel substrates in Oklahoma, Indiana,
and Minnesota. Jokinen (1992:27) says it lives “on muddy ooze or sand in slow creeks and lakes with
little aquatic vegetation” (which contradicts the references above). I am aware of no Texas data on
C. integra density, but for C. comalensis, a density of two individuals/m² has been reported at Comal
Springs in New Braunfels (Arsuffi 1993:Appendix 3), and Tolley-Jordan and Owen (2008:33) report a
density of less than one individual/m² in the Comal River at San Marcos. C. comalensis occurs both in
the slough and the river channel at San Marcos, on and under rocks and in mats of filamentous algae
(Lindholm 1979:28).
Cincinnatia integra has been recovered from the Wilson-Leonard (Shaw et al. 1998:Table 37-8) and
Richard Beene sites (Neck 2007:Table 5.2), as well as other more recent sites in Texas. In the EComm
excavations, it occurs scattered irregularly at 3.4–3.6, 3.8–3.9, 4.0–4.1, 4.2–4.4, and 4.9–5.0 mbs, but
not in the auger tests. It seems to be an infrequent component throughout the section, and perhaps
indicates the presence of a turbid, lentic water body.

Elimia comalensis Juveniles
Juvenile Elimia comalensis were found in the column sample, the auger tests, and the Unit 9 (4.9–50
mbs) sample (Figure K-15 A–C), never in abundance, but scattered throughout. This species has a
brittle shell, and adults and juveniles both are often recovered with the apex snapped off, making it
difficult to determine the original shell height. Minton and others (2007) report shell heights of about
2–21 mm for individuals of all ages in samples from Salado and Del Rio. Lindholm (1979:58) recorded
lengths of 9–22 mm. The original type description listed a maximum height of 18 mm (Fullington
1978:73). There are 11 E. comalensis in the Vara Daniel collections, and most of them have either
aperture damage, a snapped apex, or both. Shell height varies from about 2.2 mm to over 9.8 mm. The
largest specimen comes from the Unit 9 sample, probably had a height of about 11 mm before the apex
was snapped, and was probably a half-grown individual. Most of the others are embryonic to very
small juveniles not much larger than the 2 mm minimum size recorded by Minton and others (2007).
Examples of this species were found in the column sample at 3.0–3.1, 3.9–4.0, 4.2–4.3, and 4.5–4.6
mbs, in Unit 9 at 4.9–5.0 mbs, and in the auger tests at 5.2–5.4 mbs and 5.6–5.8. They seem to have
been a sporadic minor component of the aquatic snail fauna. For contemporary populations, Hayes et
al. (2007:107) report densities up to about 250/m² at Comal Springs.
This species is probably long-lived (the genus generally has lifespans of 11 years or less). The juveniles
are found among filamentous algae, while adults tend to live in open water (Minton et al. 2007:478,
480). According to Lindhom (1979:26), “Elimia comalensis is the most abundant species found in all
lotic habitats from Spring Lake to Thompson’s Island. It was not, however, present in the slough. E.
comalensis, although very common on gravel substrate, seems to prefer Ludwigia sp. and Sagittaria sp.
to other forms of vegetation.” In the Edwards Plateau, Elimia comalensis often occurs in headwater or
spring areas where the water is clear and well-oxygenated, flow is constant and fast, and the bottom is
gravelly or rocky. Salado Creek at Salado is a well-known habitat for these snails, and they also occur
in Buttermilk Creek, a tributary of the Salado. After the flood of June 14, 2001 at the Gault site, I found
a deposit containing 229 Elimia comalensis that had been washed up out of a deep pool onto a gravel
bar of Buttermilk Creek on the Meyer property. These ranged in length from 2.2 to 19.0 mm.
The Vara Daniel Elimia almost certainly derived from Barton Creek rather than the Colorado River,
and they probably did not come from the same kind of habitat as the more abundant pulmonate snails.
The species is endemic to the Edwards Plateau (Hayes et al. 2007:Figure 1). Archaeological examples
have been found at the Wilson-Leonard site (Shaw et al. 1998:Table 37-7), at 41 TG 258 in Tom Green
County (All-American Pipeline Project), and at 41 CM 25 and 41 CM 167 in San Marcos.

cf. Micromenetus dilatatus
In the column sample, two specimens were found that closely resemble Gyraulus parvus except for a
more flaring aperture with a distinctly reflected peristome and a distinct carina toward the apical surface
of the last whorl (Figure K-13 L and M’). Neither has spiral lines on the exterior. These are thought to
be examples of Micromenetus dilatatus (also listed in some literature as Menetus dilatatus), both found
in the No. 18 sieve. One specimen is from the 4.0–4.1 mbs level (diameter, 2.2 mm; height, 1.1 mm).
The other is from the 4.2–4.3 mbs level (diameter, 2.2 mm; height, 1.0 mm) and has a very distinct
growth interruption visible on the last whorl. Both of these would appear to be about 14–17 weeks
old, based on experimental data for the buchanensis subspecies by Fried and Goodchild (1963:Figure
5). According to Jokinen (1992:66), individuals become reproductively viable at a diameter of about
1.9 mm. This is a small tropical planorbid, widely distributed in the southeastern US and extending

well into the northeast; one subspecies extends into the Caribbean and Panama. It may be found on
submerged, decaying terrestrial plants, wood, and leaf litter or rocks and gravel (Harman 1972:Table 3)
and lives in springs, streams, ponds and quiet sections of rivers. This is a cosmopolitan species that can
tolerate a wide range of pH (5.6–9.5; Jokinen 1992:66–67).

Peaclams cf. Cyclocalyx sp.?
Although they are bivalves, not snails, peaclams occupy about the same size range as many microsnails
and are often recovered when fine-mesh sieving is done; hence, they are discussed here rather than in
the chapter on freshwater mussels. A dozen peaclams were recovered from the column sample (Figure
K-10 K–P), but none from the auger tests or the Unit 9 sample. Under conventional taxonomy, peaclams
have been represented by the genus Pisidium (five species in Texas), but Lee (2001) has recently
revised the taxonomy and presumably the peaclams would now be considered Cyclocalyx. Many of
the peaclams can be found in deep water [up to 35–40 m for P. (Cyclocalyx) casertanum] and on mud
or sand bottoms. Others live in shallow water and in aquatic vegetation. In Pennsylvania springs, P.
casertanum is mostly confined to silty bottoms; it normally produces one or two generations per year,
but may perhaps live as long as five years in cold, poorly oxygenated, unproductive habitats. Pisidium
(Cyclocalyx) casertanum can occur in damp sediment in stream banks and in moist leaf litter in vernal
ponds (Martin 1998:45). Without knowing the species-level identity of the Vara Daniel peaclams, it
is difficult to be specific about habitat preferences, except to say they are often found associated with
aquatic vegetation. Peaclams are occasionally recovered at archaeological sites (Berger Bluff, the
Aubrey site, and the Richard Beene site, for example) where sampling for microsnails has been done.
For the peaclams from the Vara Daniel column sample, length averages 2.07 mm (range, 1.7–2.3 mm);
height (width) averages 1.63 mm (range, 1.1–1.9 mm). They are distributed evenly over the stratigraphic
section; eight levels have only a single peaclam each, but the 4.6–4.7 and 4.7–4.8 mbs levels each have
two. These were probably associated with and arrived in company with the various kind of pulmonate
aquatic snails deposited here.

at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Figure L-1 a and b. Recent smooth pimpleback (Quadrula houstonensis). This
species is endemic to the Colorado and Brazos rivers of Central Texas.

Figure L-2 a and b. Recent smooth pimpleback (Quadrula houstonensis). The posterior left pseudocardinal tooth (above left) is often rather small and the anterior tooth is typically incisor- or chisel-like.
The right pseudocardinal tooth (above right) is usually rather narrow with a very flat anterior surface.

Figure L-4 a through e (left to right).
Smooth pimpleback (Quadrula
houstonensis) fragments and valves
from the Vara Daniel Site. Note that
in the two valves shown to the left the
anterior left pseudocardinal tooth is
more rounded and less quadrate than in
many specimens. Loss of the squared
corner of the dorsal edge of this tooth
is common both in archaeological
material and even in living animals.

Archaeological Excavation of a Deeply Buried Paleoindian Component
at the Vara Daniel Site (41TV1364), Travis County, Texas

Figure L-5 a and b. Recent threeridge (Amblema plicata). This species is often common
in archaeological sites throughout much of Texas because of its wide distribution, general
abundance in many areas, and thick, solid shell. Although the species is extremely variable
morphologically, the distinctive ridge pattern often allows identification of disk fragments
that would be unidentifiable in other species without such diagnostic sculpture patterns.

Figure L-6 a and b. Recent threeridge (Amblema plicata). Left (above left) and right (above right)
hinge teeth and beaks are heavy and readily survive extended periods after the animal has died.
Molar-like left psuedocardinal teeth are often easily identified. The right pseudocardinal tooth has a
main axis placed on an angle pointing to the posterio-ventral edge of the shell (the corresponding
tooth in washboard, Megalonaias nervosa, is angled toward the central ventral margin).

Figure L-8 a and b. Recent yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres). This species ranges from the
Rio Grande north to the Red River through the major drainages in Texas. This species is not
only sexually dimorphic, but shows variation in shell thickness and proportional lengths.

Figure L-9 a and b. Recent yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres). Many yellow sandshell specimens
have strongly compressed, lamellar pseudocardinal teeth that are rather thin and elongate.

Figure L-10 a and b. Recent yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres). Some yellow
sandshell specimens have heavier, shorter pseudocardinal teeth that are far more
robust than the thin and elongate structures often seen in other specimens.

Figure L-11. Yellow sandshell (Lampsilis teres) valve
fragment, including right pseudo-cardinal tooth
and umbo, from the Vara Daniel Site. Although the
pseudocardinal tooth and beak elevation can be
consistent with yellow sandshell, the lateral tooth
seems somewhat short for this species, suggesting
possible question about the identification.

Figure L-12 a and b. Recent Tampico pearlymussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis).
This species has a number of morphological variations throughout its range from
the Brazos River south and west into northeastern Mexico including differences
in shell inflation and thickness, umbo size and inflation, and coloration.

Figure L-13 a, b, c, and d. Recent Tampico pearlymussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis). Umbo

Figure L-15 a and b. Recent Texas pimpleback (Quadrula petrina). This species
is endemic to the Colorado and Guadalupe-San Antonio rivers of Central Texas. It
is typically larger and more massive than smooth pimpleback (Q. houstonensis);
however, elongate, less-massive riffle- or gravel-bar morphs occur.

Figure L-16 a and b. Recent Texas pimpleback (Quadrula petrina). The left pseudocardinal
teeth (above left) are somewhat more equal in size and the anterior tooth less chisellike than those of smooth pimpleback (Q. houstonensis). The right pseudocardinal tooth
(above right) is often more broad and massive than that of smooth pimpleback.

Figure L-18 a and b. Recent Southern mapleleaf (Quadrula apiculata). This species
occurs in all the major drainages in Texas and is another species with distinctive
shell sculpturing that may allow identification of disk fragments. However, it is
extremely variable and some specimens with virtually no sculpturing do occur.

Figure L-19 a and b. Recent Southern mapleleaf (Quadrula apiculata). Left
(left) and right (right) pseudocardinal and lateral teeth area usually very heavy.
Pseudocardinal teeth in both valves are often highly variable morphologically and the
interdentum is usually very short and broad with a posterior denticle in many.

Figure L-20 a and b. A possible Southern mapleleaf (Quadrula apiculata) from the Vara
Daniel Site. This fragment is tentatively identified as this species, but is atypical.
