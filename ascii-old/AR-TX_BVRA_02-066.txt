INTRODUCTION
The Bay City Independent School District proposes to construct a high school on
an 85 acre tract of land in north-central Matagorda County, Texas (Figure 1). The
project area is bounded on the north by State Highway 35 and on the remaining three
sides by private land (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on the Bay City
topographic quadrangle, dated 1952 and photorevised in 1972 (Figure 3). Proposed
construction consists of the main school buildings and secondary buildings, parking lots,
roads, and athletic fields.
Matagorda County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic, and the area has been the subject of several major archaeological
investigations. As part of its comprehensive environmental impact statement (EIS),
Walton and Associates, Inc. requested BVRA to conduct an archaeological survey
which was performed under Texas Antiquities permit 2189 and BVRA project number
99-08. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore.
The following general discussion of Matagorda County was taken from the 19841985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983) and a biological assessment of the
nearby Matagorda County Birding Nature Center (Brannon 1999). Matagorda County is
situated in Southeast Texas and consists of 1157 square miles. Elevation in the county
varies between sea level and 70 feet above sea level. Overall, the topography is
characterized as flat broken by bays. The county is drained by the Colorado River,
which bisects the county, and numerous creeks. Annual rainfall averages 47.29 inches.
The January minimum temperature is 48 degrees, and the July maximum temperature
is 90 degrees. These climatic conditions create a growing season of 296 days.
There is no current soils book for Matagorda County. According to the local
Natural Resources Conservation Service office (NRCS) in Bay City, the soils in the
county are currently being reassessed. Current data, however, shows the project area
to be located entirely within Dacosta sandy clay loam soils (DaA), 0 to 1 percent slopes.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Central and
Southern Planning Region of Texas (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:Figure 1.1.4),
Matagorda County is situated within the Southern Coastal Corridor archeological study
region. In 1985, according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:159), Matagorda County contained 26 recorded sites.
The site files at TARL revealed 116 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985,
no sites in the county had been excavated, 2 had been tested by hand, and all 26 had
been surface collected. Fourteen recorded prehistoric sites in the county are Late
Prehistoric, and five sites are listed as Archaic (Biesaart 1985:165). It is beyond the
scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological background of Matagorda
County, especially when numerous contract reports are available. The interested
reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the planning
document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996),
and an article entitled A Model for Cultural Succession for the Coastal Bend Area of
Texas (Corbin 1974) for more detailed information regarding the archaeology of
Matagorda County.
The first archaeological examination was conducted in 1932 when Woolsey
recorded the Battle Island site (41MG1). In 1941, G. E. Arnold of the University of
Texas at Austin reported finding one large prehistoric campsite and three shell middens.
In 1971, when Alton K. Briggs published Archeological Resources in the Texas Coastal
Lowlands and Littoral, only four sites were known in the county, and one had been
destroyed by Hurricane Carla.
One of the early (and most extensive at the time) studies in the county was a
survey of the Matagorda Bay area that included an inspection of the lower reaches of
the Colorado River (Fritz 1975). This study used a shallow draft boat for a preliminary
investigation of the Colorado River as the Pleistocene terraces could only be easily
examined from the present river channel. No sites along the Colorado River were seen
from the boat; "the cut banks were devoid of visible archeological remains" (Fritz
1975:10). Also, spot checks on foot at various points along the Colorado and its West
Branch yielded negative information, and local residents knew of no prehistoric sites
along these streams. Therefore, no further work along this drainage was conducted.
The nearest prehistoric sites to the project area were found along the shores of two
natural lakes. In 1980, archaeologists from The University of Texas at San Antonio
surveyed an area adjacent to the lower reaches of the Colorado. No sites were found
along the river, and the prehistory of Matagorda County was classified as "poorly
understood at present" (Gibson and Gibson 1980). The most recent archaeological
investigation in the county was a recent survey of a 23 acre tract by BVRA in May 1999.
This study examined an area along the current bank of the Colorado River and a creek
and tributary within the project area. Although the area appeared to be a likely setting
for prehistoric sites not one was found.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the 100% pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and probing. The entire area was walked (6 transects) and examined
by 39 shovel tests and probes (Figure 2). When possible, excavated matrix was
screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth. In most cases, however, the hard clay had to
be broken apart by hand. Only ten shovel tests had enough sandy soil to allow for
screening. Virtually the entire project area consisted of very hard clay at or near the
existing ground surface. Due to cattle trails and extensive grazing, surface visibility is
estimated to be at least 40% over the entire area; some areas were less visible than
others.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. A review of the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and
historic sites are present in Matagorda County. No archaeological sites in the county
are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). There are, however, two
sites in the county that are listed as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). These are
the Mad Island Marsh Preserve (41MG60) on the coast and the Caney Creek Historic
Shipwreck (41MG32). Numerous pre-twentieth century shipwrecks are known in the
county. This investigation examined 85 acres, and no archaeological sites were found.
The only evidence of activity in the project area was a road for farm vehicles, cattle hoof
prints, and other indications that the area had been used for grazing, and rusted pipes
presumably used for irrigation purposes. Overall, given the distance from the project
area to dependable water sources*, the 85 acres is considered a low probability area for
prehistoric sites. It also appears that this area has always been used for some type of
agricultural activity, probably cattle grazing, and not as an area for settlement.
Soils in the project area appear to be representative of a Blackland Site as
described on the "Nontechnical Soils Description Report" published by the NRCS.
According to the NRCS report, a Blackland Site consists of deep, dark, clay soils on
nearly level coast prairies. Climax vegetation is a treeless, tall grass prairie. Plants
found in this setting include little bluestem, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass,
indiangrass, big bluestem, florida paspalum panicums, sedges, snakeroot, gayfeathers,
mimosa, sensitivebrier, neptunia, bundleflower, gaura, and indianplantain.
_________
* The Colorado River is more than 1000 meters to the west, and Cottonwood Creek is
more than 1500 meters to the east.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible
that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey. Should
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered during
construction, all work should cease immediately. The Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission, should be notified so that this find can be evaluated before
continuing with this project.
