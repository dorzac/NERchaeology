ABSTRACT
Although it is a Southwestern affiliated area, western Texas largely has been ignored by
regional archeologists. The area’s ceramic chronology was sketched out some 30 years ago and
not substantially modified until 1976. A combination and synthesis is presented of results of
several recent ceramic studies in and around the Hueco Bolson, immediately east of El Paso
(Texas). These analyses consisted of morphological studies of local wares in order to discover
stylistic trends which were potentially significant as chronological markers; and application of a
series of radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates in order to
place the sequence in time. Results of these efforts are a new, and early, origin date for local West
Texas ceramics ai~d a substantially refined developmental sequence for these wares.

INTRODUCTION
Archeologists have long recognized the Southwestern affinites of the prehistoric cultures of western Texas (Stallings, 1932). This tradition includes
sedentary villages of pithouses and later multiroomed pueblos, corn-beansquash agriculture, and extensive use of ceramics. Nevertheless, western
Texas traditionally has attracted little of the attention of Southwestern archeologists. This situation undoubtedly is due to the area’s position on the
periphery of the Greater Southwest.
The ceramic chronology of western Texas was established in very broad
terms between 1930 and 1948 (Stallings, 1930, 1931; Lehmer, 1948). The
chronology largely was created by application of chronological schemes from
better known areas of the Southwest. Dated ceramics from the nearby Casas
Grandes, Mimbres, and Gila areas were employed extensively. These intricately decorated, highly visible, intrusive ceramics characteristically occur in
small quantities in western Texas and are not usually present on small sites.
Early ceramic studies gave very limited attention to the less complex local
ceramics which make up the overwhelming majority of every western Texas
sherd collection.
What little work was done with local western Texas ceramics succeeded in
establishing two basic, although very broad, categories. The later type, El
Paso Polychrome, was described by Stallings (1930, 1931). Polychrome is a
misnomer as vessels of this type are decorated with black and red only. The
predecessor of El Paso Polychrome was not recognized for some years.
Lehmer (1948) defined El Paso Brown as the local manifestation of the
Pithouse period brownware tradition which was widespread in portions of
eastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, northern Mexico, and western

Texas. Association of western Texas ceramics with tree ring dated intrusive
ceramic types allowed Lehmer (1948:87-90) to postulate a date range of ca
1050 B.P. - 850 B.P. (A.D. 900 - A.D. 1100) for El Paso Brown and ca 850
B.P. - 550 B.P. (A.D. 1100 - A.D. 1400) for El Paso Polychrome.
Two important points were left unclarified. First, Lehmer’s (1948) chronological scheme had ceramics and pithouse villages appearing in the area at
1050 B.P. (A.D. 900), ca 1,000 years after their documented appearance in
more central portions of the Southwest. The effect of this chronological
scheme was to cause western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico to appear
to be extremely peripheral with respect to Greater Southwestern development. The question, then, is whether or not such a characterization is correct.
The second point concerns the developmental progression between El Paso
Brown and El Paso Polychrome. Details of this sequence are of great utility in
subdivision of the long Pithouse and Pueblo periods into finer chronological
units in the numerous cases in which diagnostic intrusive ceramics are not
present.
The present study is directed at these problems. It combines and synthesizes results of several ceramic analyses in and around the Hueco Bolson,
immediately east of El Paso (Texas) (Whalen, 1978, in press). These analyses
consisted of morphological studies of El Paso Brown and Polychrome vessels
in order to discover stylistic trends which potentially were significant as chronological markers; and application of a series of radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates to place the stylistic
sequence in time.

CERAMIC ORIGINS
Two recent series of radiocarbon dates from western Texas (Whalen, in
press) and adjacent portions of Southcentral New Mexico (Morenon and
Hays, 1978) show that undecorated brown ceramics appeared in the first half
of the Christian era (Table 1). The first three dates are from the Hueco
Bolson, adjacent to El Paso. Other dates are from the Rio Grande Valley near
Hatch (New Mexico), ca 60 m northwest of the Hueco Bolson.
These findings have several important implications. First, a nonceramic
Archaic period did not last until 1050 B.P. (A.D. 900) in western Texas and
Southcentral New Mexico as Lehmer (1948:88) originally suggested.
Lehmer’s (1948) dated El Paso Brown does not represent the beginning of
ceramic use in the area. Instead, he was dating the last part of a long Pithouse
period. Second, western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico did not lag as
far behind developed Southwestern areas as Lehmer’s (1948) chronological
scheme implied.
The circumstances under which ceramics come into use all over the Southwest are obscure. Ceramics appear at the beginning of the Christian era, or in
its early centuries, over substantial portions of the region. Associated with
these ceramics are pithouse villages which were at least semisedentary and
semiagricultural (Morenon and Hays, 1978~ Whalen, 1980). Common use
of ceramics appears to be concomitant with a basically new way of life which

appeared at roughly the same time all over the Southwest. Radiocarbon dates
show that, far from lagging 1,000 years behind in such developments, western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico participated in a similar series of
cultural developments at a comparable time.

CERAMIC EVOLUTION
Initial steps in subdivision of western Texas brownwares were taken by
radiocarbon dating two archeological sites from which two distinctive
brownware vessel rim shapes were recovered (Table 2). Starred figures in
Table 2 are ceramic thermoluminescence dates~ others are radiocarbon
dates.
Each of these forms was the overwhelmingly dominant one at its site of
occurrence. The two sites were Pithouse period villages located in the Hueco
Bolson of western Texas (Whalen, 1977, 1978). Rim variants observed at
these two sites are termed pinched and pinched-flattened. The pinched variety (Fig. 1) is made by drawing the wet clay of the vessel rim to a small point,
most probably between the fingers of the potter. The pinched-flattened variety (Fig. 2) noticeably is flattened at the very top of the rim as if the wet clay
had been thinned and drawn into a point, but then flattened slightly.
Differences other than rim form also exist between pinched rim
brownwares (early brownwares) and pinched-flattened rims (late
brownwares). Early brownware vessels seem to be both smaller and thicker
walled than any of their successors. Mean rim diameter is 13.2 cm (standard
deviation = 4.3, n = 24). Mean vessel wall thickness for a sample of 100
body sherds is 5.6 mm (standard deviation = 1.1). In comparison, late
brownware rim diameters averaged 17.0 cm (standard deviation = 4.9, n =
20). Mean vessel wall thickness in a sample of 100 late brownware body
sherds was 5.0 mm (standard deviation = 0.9).
The significance of the difference in vessel wall mean thickness in early and
late brownware variants was tested using the t test for means in two indepen-

dent populations. The hypothesis tested was that the early brownware thickness mean (/.1) is equal to the late brownware thickness means (/.2), or Ho:
/.1 -- /’2" The alternative hypothesis is that the earlier brownware thickness
mean is significantly greater than that of the later brownware, or H 1:/’1 ~/’2"
The level of significance of the test (~) is 0.01. The form of the alternative
hypothesis requires a one-tailed t test in which the null hypothesis is rejected if
the calculated value of t is greater than a critical value (k), defined as tI _ i/2c~
for N1 + N2 - 2 degrees of freedom. The value of k is read from tables of
percentiles for the t distribution.
The t statistic is"

cal-

as:
(N1- 1)Sl2 + (N2- 1)s22
SP2 =

(N1 - 1) + (N2- 1)

In this case, df -- 198. Substituting the mean and standard deviation values
for earlier and later brownware thicknesses, t = 4.29. The critical value (k) for
198 degrees of freedom and a level of significance of 0.01 is 2.58. As t is
greater than k, Ho is rejected in favor of H1. The mean thickness of earlier El
Paso Brown is significantly greater than the mean thickness of later El Paso
Brown in this sample.
A similar t-test was performed for rim diameters. The hypothesis tested was
that the earlier and later brownware have the same mean rim diameter. The
alternative hypothesis states that the mean rim diameter for later brownware
is significantly greater than that of earlier brownware. In this case, df = 42,
t = 2.73, and k = 2.01 at the 0.5 level, leading to rejection of the null
hypothesis. Mean rim diameter increases significantly between earlier and
later Pithouse times in this sample.
Earlier vessel finish ranges from coarse and bumpy with frequent pits and
scrape marks (common), to somewhat finer finish (uncommon). Vessels are
never very finely finished. Small, hollow, red painted triangles decorate the
lip of one rim sherd in this sample. A deep horizontal groove also appears
below the lip of another specimen. It is impossible at present to quantify the
frequency of occurrence of painting and incising, but both are quite rare.
Surface finish of later El Paso Brown vessels as a group is somewhat finer
than that of their predecessors. The pit and scrape marks which appeared so
frequently on earlier brownware do not seem to characterize the later assemblage. Small red and black painted geometric motifs occasionally are
present on rim sherds. This painting appears to occur more frequently on later
than on earlier brownware, but this suggestion cannot be validated with current data.
Vessel shape is more difficult to compare in early and late brown ware
assemblages. General brownware vessel forms include ladels, hemispherical
bowls, neckless jars similar to Mexican tecomates or Southwestern seed jars,
and wide mouthed jars with a short, near vertical neck (Fig. 3). Vessels seem
to be round bodied; flat vessel bottoms have not been recorded. The percentage of each vessel type in the general assemblage cannot be estimated with
much accuracy at present. It appears that ladles make up a small percentage
of the total assemblage, while hemispherical bowls and neckless jars each
constitute about 25 % of a sample of 32 early rim sherds. Necked jars make up
about 50% of the early sample.
The frequency of occurrence of these vessel types may differ in later times,
although the late brownware rim sherd sample is too small to attempt definitive pronouncements. Tentatively, this late brownware assemblage appears
to have fewer neckless jars and an increasing proportion of necked jars. Neckless jars are quite uncommon in the succeeding Pueblo period.
Some painting on the exteriors of jars also seems to make its appearance in
brownware times, although it is never common. Painted examples of the

pinched-flattened brownwares are shown in Figure 4. These decorations are
simple, crude, and widely spaced. They may well be the marks of fingertips
dipped in paint and drawn over portions of the vessel in roughly parallel lines.
A trend in brownware rim shape may be toward a simple direct rim form, i.e.,
one that is rounded rather than being pinched or flattened. This rim form is
not well represented in current collections.
It appears that brownware jars diminish in frequency after 850 B.P. (A.D.
1100) or during the western Texas Pithouse to Pueblo transition period. The

decline of brownware jars appears to be synchronous with the rise of El Paso
Polychrome jars. Unpainted or scantily painted hemispherical bowls outlast
brownware jars. By early Pueblo times, these bowls appear to be the only
surviving remnants of the millennium old brownware tradition.
It is in the Pithouse to Pueblo transition, ca 850 B.P. - 750 B.P. (A.D.
1100 - A.D. 1200), that El Paso Polychrome makes its initial appearance.
Lehmer (1948) and succeeding workers (Whalen, 1977, 1978) used El Paso

Polychrome as a broad diagnostic of post Pithouse times, i.e., after 850 B.P.
(A.D. 1100). However, the type can be broken into early and late variants
which are recognizable even in very small ceramic samples.
The early variant of El Paso Polychrome was defined and described on
stylistic grounds by Whalen (1978), although firm dates were not available.
Subsequent work by Way (1979) established a firmer chronological framework for early Polychrome. Way (1979:44-51) dates the ware at 850 B.P. 700 B.P. (A.D. 1100 - A.D. 1250). The initial date relies on association of the
early Polychrome ware with Mimbres Black-on-White, a well dated intrusive
ceramic from southwestern New Mexico. Confirmation of this suggestion
comes from a recent radiocarbon date of 800 + 50 B.P. (A.D. 1150 + 50,
Tx 1735). The dated charcoal was associated with the early variant of El Paso
Polychrome at the Hueco Tanks site, east of El Paso (Kegley, 1980:10).
A ceramic thermoluminescence reading of 745 + 67 B.P. (A.D. 1233 +
67, WU-77d7) also was secured from a western Texas sherd of the early
Polychrome type (Whalen, in press). Archaeomagnetic dates on associated
features provide an approximate end for the ware, which is not present in
western Texas Pueblo period contexts dated to 690 + 18 B.P. (A.D. 1260 +
18) and 655 + 13 B.P. (A.D. 1295 + 13). Both these determinations are
archaeomagnetic dates from the Earth Science Laboratory, University of
Oklahoma. The early Polychrome variant thus seems to appear in the early or
middle 12th Century and to extend into the middle or late 13th Century in
western Texas and adjacent portions of Southcentral New Mexico.
The late variant of El Paso Polychrome, termed Classic El Paso Polychrome by Way (1979), is the best known form of the ware. It appears in the
latter half of the 13th Century. Archaeomagnetic dates (690 + 18 B.P. and
655 + 13 B.P.) denote the earliest recorded appearances of late (Classic) El
Paso Polychrome in western Texas. The ware persists until the end of the
Pueblo period in western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico. Additional
archaeomagnetic dates (Brook, 1970) and ceramic thermoluminescence
dates (Whalen, in press) place this event fairly firmly at 630 B.P. - 590 years
B.P. (A.D. 1350- A.D. 1390).
Major morphological differences between the early and late variants of El
Paso Polychrome are shape of jar rims and necks and form and extent of
vessel decoration. Early Polychrome jars have straight, near vertical necks
with globular bodies. The general shape of these jars is reminiscent of the
brownware jars of the preceding Pithouse period. Marked thickening of the
vessel lip also is present in most early Polychrome jars. Rim profiles are wedge
shaped with flattened tips. This trend finds its fullest development in the succeeding late Polychrome wares.
Late Polychrome vessels are characterized by widely flared rims (Fig. 6).
This flaring may become more extreme as the Pueblo period progresses,
although current data are inadequate for pursuit of this issue. Collection and
measurement of flare angles, together with a series of absolute dates, might
provide a useful chronological tool for subdivision of the late Pueblo period.
Further investigation certainly is warranted.
Vessel size continues to increase between late brownware and early Polychrome times. Mean vessel wall thickness in a sample of 100 early Poly-

chrome jar body sherds is 5.3 mm (standard deviation: 1.1). The mean rim
diameter for a sample of 15 early Polychrome rims is 20.3 cm (standard
deviation: 5.0). The hypothesis that early Polychrome significantly was
thicker than late brownware was tested against a null hypothesis of no significant difference. In this case, df = 198, t -- 2.14, and k = 1.96 at the .05
level, necessitating rejection of the null hypothesis. Mean vessel thickness
significantly is greater in early Polychrome jars than in late brownware jars in
this sample.
In the second case, the hypothesis that early Polychrome rim diameters
significantly were greater than late brownware rim diameters was tested
against a null hypothesis of no significant difference. Degrees of fre~edom =
33, t = 1.95, and k = 2.04 at the .05 level. The null hypothesis of no

significant difference in mean rim diameter cannot be rejected at the. 05 level.
Mean rim diameter is not significantly greater in early Polychrome than in late
brownware in this small sample.
Late Polychrome vessels continued to increase in size through the latter
part of the Pueblo period, some of the largest standing 56 cm high. Comparable figures are not available for early Polychrome jars, as whole specimens are
lacking. Mean vessel wall thickness for 100 late Polychrome jar sherds is 5.1
m m (standard deviation: 1.4). Mean rim diameter for 20 late Polychrome jars
is 25.8 cm (standard deviation: 6.6). The hypothesis that early Polychrome
significantly Was thicker than late Polychrome was t-tested against a null hypothesis of no significant difference in jar wall thickness. Degrees of freedom
were 198, t = 1.1, and k = 1.98, requiring acceptance of the null hypothesis
of no significant difference in mean vessel wall thickness.
The hypothesis that late Polychrome mean rim diameter significantly was
greater than that of early Polychrome was tested against a null hypothesis of
no significant difference. Degrees of freedom were 33, t = 2.69, and k =
2.03 at the .05 level. As t is greater than k, the null hypothesis of no significant
difference in mean rim diameter is rejected. The mean rim diameter of late
Polychrome vessels significantly is greater than that of their early Polychrome
predecessors.
The early and late variants of El Paso Polychrome are recognizable not only
by size and rim/neck shape, but also by style of painting. In both cases, black
and red geometric designs are applied in a horizontal band around the upper
third of the jar. This band of decoration is discontinuous in early Polychrome
vessels, with wide areas of brown clay body showing between black and red
stripes (Fig. 5). Painting also appears to be somewhat crude by later Polychrome standards; early Polychrome designs appear to be larger, more open,
and less intricate than their late Polychrome successors.
Figure 7 summarizes the evolutionary trends in El Paso Brown and Polychrome wares. These dates go back only to 1550 B.P. (A.D. 400), although
brown ceramics occur in western Texas in contexts as old as 1850 B.P. - 1650
B.P. (A.D. 100 - A.D. 300). Rims are not present with these oldest dated
sherds. It is not certain that the thin pinched rim characterized the area’s
earliest pottery.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Data presented indicate that the ceramics of western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico considerably are older than previously realized. These
ceramics are part of a tradition which was widespread over eastern Arizona,
southern New Mexico, and portions of northern Mexico. A corollary implication of this finding is that western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico no
longer appear to be as peripheral and underdeveloped a portion of the southwest as the traditional chronological scheme implied by assuming 1050 B.P.
(A.D. 900) as the end of the area’s preceramic period.
A second objective was to propose the first detailed developmental sequence for the area’s ceramics. This sequence is intended to be a working

model, rather than a definitive pronouncement. The proposed sequence ties
a number of stylistic attributes of local western Texas pottery to a series of
radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates.
The sequence is not an arbitrary or stylistic ordering of rim shapes.
The progression introduced in Figure 7 recognizes central tendencies at
several points in time; too little is known about how change is made from one
to another of these rim form variants. Pinched brownware rims are recognized as earlier than flattened brownware rims, although there may be intermediate stages in which pinched and flattened forms occur together or as
ambiguous hybrids. Rates and directions of change in ceramic styles may or
may not have been uniform over a large region.
Ceramic studies in western Texas should be seen as in a formative stage.
Work to date has suggested a particular progression between several central
tendencies in rim form. Most details necessary to fill gaps in the proposed
scheme are lacking. More excavation and absolute dating of ceramics from
controlled proveniences are needed. Studying fine scale progressions of
ceramic change from the Hueco Bolson’s severely eroded surface remains
alone is difficult. Rim sherds are few in number, often badly damaged, and
their proveniences and associations frequently unclear. The area’s subsurface
ceramics are better preserved and in clearer association with each other and
with other datable materials. It is these deposits which should prove most
useful in continued refinement of the ceramic chronology of western Texas.
