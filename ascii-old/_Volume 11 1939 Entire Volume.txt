STONE CULTURES NEAR CERRO PEDERNAL
AND THEIR GEOLOGICAL ANTIQUITY~
BY KIRK BRYAN

The present active interest in the early human cultures of the New
World has been largely focused on the cultures associated with
extinct animals. These were hunting or food-gathering peoples
apparently quite different from the American Indian. Geologic
studies indicateI that at least one of these cultures, the Folsom, is
of considerable antiquity and presumably many of the other cultures associated with extinct animals are also old. In consequence,
the interval of time between Folsom man and the earliest Puebloan
or other strictly Amerindian peoples is a long one. Many new
groups of people may have entered the New World and many cultural phases may have developed during this time.
The present paper records the finding of a stone culture in north
central New Mexico, here called the Los Encinos culture, which
seems on geologic grounds to find a place in this interval. The
artifacts of tiffs culture hre l£rge, made by percussion chipping, and
in marked contrast to the relatively delicate points and other tools
of the earlier cultures. However, they closely resemble the artifacts
of the stone cultures of Texas and Oklahoma which have already
been accorded some measure of antiquity. It seems probable that
the Los Encinos culture lies in the great time interval pre-Amerindian
and post-Folsom.
Geologically, this study indicates that alternate periods of erosion
and alluviation on streams furnish a chronology of late Quaternary
time and that similar sequences are found in widely separated localities. It seems clear, however, that local chronolgies cannot be completely reconciled with one another until the stone cultures contained
in the alluvium are better understood.
A preliminary investigation of the Cerro PedernaI area was made
in 1937, as already recorded.2 Five days of field work in 1938

It is obvious, however, that the area and the culture must have further investigation before definitive results can be obtained.
Geology el the Cerro Pedernal

./lr6"a3

Cerro Pedernal is a well-known peak on the north flank of the
Jemez Mountains in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. It has a
maxiznum elevation of 9,857 feet and stands about 3,000 feet above
the broad lowland of the Lower Chama Valley (Plate 1). The
Spanish word "pedernal" means "flint" and it seems likely that the
name is a translation of an Indian term of similar meaning for in
the Tewa language this peak is called Tsiping,’~ which means "flint
mountain."
In the vicinity of Cerro Pedernal, the rocks consist of flat-lying
sedimentary and volcanic beds which range in age from Permian
to Recent. Cerro Pedernal itself is composed of Tertiary rocks resting on Cretaceous sandstone. Near the base of the Tertiary, at an
elevation of about 8,500 feet, the Pedernal cherts crops out. This
bed, to be discussed later in detail, formed the source of the artifacts
whose discovery led to the present paper. Above the chert lie tuff
beds which are capped by the remaaants of a basalt flow.
Great and extensive landslides mantle the slopes of Cerro Pedernal. They consist largely of fragments of the basalt that forms the
flat summit of the mountain, but fragments of all the other rocks
of the mountain including the chert occur in them. Most of the
landslide masses are probably of considerable antiquity for streams
have cut valleys in them that attain depths of 100 feet or more. The
extent of the landslide movement is indicated by the presence of
masses of debris three or four miles north of the mountain. These
masses are mere caps on hills now entirely isolated by the extensive

erosion that has occurred since the original movement. The phenomenon of extensive and ancient landsliding is not confined to
Cerro Pedernal but is also characteristic of much of the mountain
front to the west.

There are stream deposits of two categories in the area, including
alluvium of several ages and pediment gravels. The pediment
gravels arc not important here. The alluvium is three-fold in charaeter and is typically developed in the valley of the Rito de los
Eneinos, a small stream just west of Cerro Pedernal (Plate 1).
The Rito de los Encinos is a tributary of the Rio PuertoO which
in turn joins the Chama River. It has a small perennial flow and
irrigates fields near the village of Youngsville, locally called E1
Rito.

Its valley lies incised in the remnants of old erosion surfaces

which now stand above it as gravel-capped spurs and small, flattopped ridges. The valley flares out below Youngsville into a broad
alluvial plain with island-like hills of sandstone. It ends suddenly
at the brink of the shallow canyon occupied by the Rio Puerco.
The Rito and its companion streams are held to a high level by the
massive Permian sandstone which forms the walls of the canyon.
The alluvium that fills the valley of the Rito may be divided into
three types (Plate 2). These three fills, here called the Early
Alluvium, the Intermediate Alluvium, and the Late Alluvium, differ
largely as to color, compactness and humus content.

The Early Alluvium has a more reddish color than the other
types. It is also more firm and compact not only in the gravelly
beds but also in the finer-grained beds. No trace of human occupation was found, but near the point A, Plate 1, a fragment of Probescidian tusk, too small and decayed to be more closely identified, was
found.
The Intermediate Alluvium is less compact than the Early Alluvium and contains more humus. Its gravelly beds are cemented by
lime carbonate to form masses relatively resistant to erosion. Here
were found large flint chips in considerable quantity and several
impleraents to be more partieularly described.
6. l~ote: There are two other R|o Puercos tn l~ew Mexico, beth larger and better
known.
"l~he R|o Puerto (of the East) is a tributary of the Rio Grande ~ the Rio
Puerto (of the West) flow~ into Ariffiona and is a tributary of the Little Colorado.

14

Texas A~’eheological and Pa~eon$olog~cal Society

The Late Alluvium is loose and friable. Its finer materials, sandy
clays and loams, are bro~wa with humus and its deposition was but
recently interrupted by the cutting of the existing arroyo. Its surface represents the floodplain abandoned by the stream when it
began to cut the present arroyo. The date at which the present
arroyo-cutting began has not been determined historically, but it is
clearly recent and presumably falls in the period since 1885 when
most of the arroyos of the area were deepened and widened. The
Late Alluvium contains a few charcoal hearths and many flint chips.
It is notable that these chips are all small and thin and such as
would result from the manufacture of the relatively small, chipped
implements used by peoples of the Pueblo culture.
The two younger bodies of alluvium occupy most of the valley
south of the main road passing through Youngsville. It is obvious
that the Late Alluvium occupies a large gully in the Intermediate
Alluvium which forms most of the valley floor. The Early Alluvium appears in the banks of the present arroyo near the road and
north of the road occupies both banks of the present arroyo. During
the time of the deposition of the two younger alluviums, the stream
probably had a somewhat more easterly course in the area north
of the road.
These three bodies of alluvium record three periods of alluviation
when the Rito de los Encinos built a broad floodplain. Each of
these periods was followed by a period of dissection during which
the stream excavated a broad gully in the floodplain (Plate 2). It
appears that the dissection following the deposition of the Early
Alluvium was severe and perhaps prolonged as the alluvium was
almost entirely removed from the area of the valley south of the
road. The gully formed by the dissection of the Intermediate
Alluvium was smaller in size and very little larger than the present
arroyo.
It seems probable that other streams of the vicinity had a similar
history, but field work has not been extended to thern. Somewhat
similar conditions of alternate erosion and sedimentation are known
on other streams of the Southwest. As these events occurred in part

17

at least during the occupation of the area by prehistoric peoples, a
chronology of the changes in the streams becomes also a chronology
of the cultures. Furthermore, the cultures become tools for the
interpretation of these geologic events.
The Peder,~ Chert

The Pedernal chert is a member of the Tertiary Abiquiu formation
whose type locality is an area of badlands in the vicinivy of the
of Abiquiu, east of Cerro Pedernal. The work of Church and Hack7
shows that the chert horizon is locally persistent. They have traced
it (or beds of similar chert at the same horizon) westward in the
Mesa de Grulla and Mesa Valdez to San Pedro Mountain, a total
distance of 20 miles. They found that it is associated with and
grades into limestone so that the chert seems to be a replacement of
limestone by silica. Further study must precede complete solution
of the problem of origin.
The chert is commonly white to pearly gray in color though in
places the color may vary considerably. Near the base and sometimes near the top tho chert ~ows bands ¼ to ½ inch thick and is
Mack in color. In pla~es near the top, weathering has changed the
color to pink, red, or yellow. The red color also occurs as flecks
or spots in the white to pearly gray mass. Generally the yellow
color is associated with clear, very translucent phases of the chert.
This translucent type usually occurs in small masses near the top
of the bed.
Hack’s study of thin sections shows that the greater part of the
mass consists of chalcedony in long, thin fibres. There are many
spherulites and clusters of granular quartz. Small quartz crystals
line small, open cavities and cracks which, in places, form linear
patterns in the mass. Grains of feldspar and more or less rounded
quartz, obviously sand grains, occur sparingly. In places, the:re are
single crystals or small masse of calcite, particularly in localities
where ~he chert passes over into limestone.
The chert is remarkably free from flaws and joints. Joints are
widely spaced and the other flaws and imperfections in the chert
are not numerous so that masses of clear, sound flint 2 to 3 feet in

diameter can be obtained. The material breaks by conchoidal fracture with almost equal facility in any direction. Examination of
quarry fragments shows that the aboriginal flint workers were only
occasionally hampered by the quartz-lined cavities and other original
flaws and defects of the material. Flat surfaces with the delicate
tracery of "feather breaks" are quite common and in marked contrast to the conchoidal breaks.
The color and variations in color, the "feather breaks," and the
character of the flaws all provide criteria for the identification of
the material. The large size of the pieces furnishes a further, if
negative, criterion. There is no other known source of chert in north
central New Mexico from which such large pieces can be easily
obtained. Artifacts made from the chert and found at localities
40 to 80 miles from Cerro Pedernal have already been identified.s
The Quarries
The main quarry on Cerro Pedernal has already been described.9
This quarry lies on the southwest side of the peak (Plate 1, Locality
1). There are two other quarry sites (Plate 1, Localities 2 and 3),
but there the quantity of quarry refuse is small. The chips from
these two localities are also small in size indicating that these quarries were either worked by later peoples than those who worked the
main site or that later peoples have carried off the quarry refuse.
The quarry refuse at the main site, as shown by a small pit, Is 1½
feet deep and composed of large fragments and chips. It contains
implements in various stages of manufacture similar to those found
on the surface of the quarry refuse. There are also a few hammerstones made of fragments of basalt from the cliffs above or of river
pebbles of quartzite from the Chama River or the Tertiary gravels.

ficulties. Obviously such artifacts can be put in three main categories: (1) tools u~ in quarrying or in fashioning artifacts; (2)
rejects, or’artifacts partially or imperfectly made and rejected; (3)
"blanks" or partially fabricated or conventionally shaped pieces to
be carried away and elsewhere fabricated. Such a classification is
based on the assumption, which cannot be wholly true, that no perfectly fabricated artifacts were lost in the d6bris and that no artifacts
were locally used except for quarrying.
The theory that blanks are common features of quarry refuse has
been argued at length by Holmeslo who, in 1894, investigated a
quarry site in what is now Oklahoma, seven miles northwest of
Seneca, Mo., and 10 miles southeast of Baxter Springs, Kau. Here
over an area of four or five acres he found numerous pits and great
quantities of chips and fragments of flint. He found partly formed
and almost complete implements taking the form of "blades" or
"disks" which he interpreted as "blanks." He held that the quarries were worked by professionals over a long but relatively continuous interval of time. Further, because of the suitability of the
material and the skill of the workman, the shapes produced were
predetermined and at certain pits only certain shapes were made; at
others all the local forms were made, perhaps by the same workman.
The illustrations, of Holmes’ paper, both photographs and drawings, show bifaces made by percussion chipping. Mostly they are
large, thick ovals. In size they range from a maximum 18 by 10
inches and 6 inches thick (45x25x15 c~n.) to 4x2 inches and ½ of an
inch in thickness (10xSxl.2 cm.). The average length would not
exceed 6 inches. This average is about the usual size of hand axes
of the Paleolithic cultures. He Mso gives an illustration (see Fig. 7)
of a thin but broken blade which is leaf-shaped and about ~ of an
inch (1 cm.) in maximum thickness. As restored, it is 5 inches long
and nearly 2 inches wide (12.5x5 cm.). Other objects shown include
bifaces that could be used as choppers although Holmes considers
that they (see his PI. 9, a and b) are merely cores from which flakes
were removed. He also gives an illustration (see his P1. 9, c) of a
large flake struck from a core and resembling a ’q~evallois" flake.
One edge seems to have been retouched either to shape the edge or by
use. It is what is usually called a high-backed or carinate scraper.

He also gives illustrations of two cores each with flat and parallel
striking platforms and trapezoidal cross-section. Such corcs are, as
Holmes infers, suitable for the systematic production of thin flakes.
Hohnes considers that none of these forms is a final form but that
all except the cores are "blanks" or rejected, partially formed
"blanks." These blanks were to be carried elsewhere for final finishing. This is an ingenious theory which might be accepted except for
three considerations: (1) the forms are usable as they stand without
further shaping; (2) as blanks for further elaboration they appear
because of their t~ckness to be unusable if the ordinary scrapers
or arrow points of the late Indians are to be made; (3) bifaees of
similar aspect have been found in the Burnt Rock Mounds of Texas11
in circumstances which indicate that they were in use as implements.
It would seem that further investigation would bring to light the
habitation sites of the quarrymen and demonstrate that the greater
part of the forms were used as manufactured in the quarry.
Holmes argues at length on the comparative recency of the work,
basing his argument on the freshness of the chips, the form of the
pits, and the youthfulness of the trees. This line of argument is
strictly qualitative. Few things are as resistant to weathering as a
well-drained pile of flint chips. The age of the trees growing in
the quarry refuse, estimated at 75 years, is interesting evidence, but
as fires in these woods have occurred on numerous occasions in the
past, the age of the present forest merely records the length of time
back to the last fire. One "aged" oak on the edge of a quarry pit,
with its roots almost wholly in the rock rather than the refuse heap,
is thought to have been growing when the pit was worked. This
argumentation seems faulty, the tree roots may have avoided the
quarry refuse as too dry an environment in favor of uhe cracks in the
bed-rock.
It seems entirely possible that such pits might persist for a period
as great as 1000 o~ even 5000 years. Their antiquity must be deII. Jackson, A. T., The Fall Cr-~k S|~: Annual Report W. P. A. and Unive~i~

tided on that of the stone culture. The large implements made by
percussion resemble those of Texas cultures such as the lower part
of the Burnt Reek Mound culture, Edwards Plateau culture, and
Clear Fork culture, all of which have claims to some antiquity.
The artifacts from the Cerro Pedernal quarry are interpreted as
quarry tools and partially fabricated implements intended for use.
The theory of "blanks" seems unacceptable because of the argument heretofore made with regard to the Oklahoma quarry, and
further because certain types have been found in the Intermediate
Alluvium which show evidence of wear and use. Until such time as
caches of "blanks" are found in camp.sites associated with the
artifacts made from them, the theory seems to be an argument without substantiation.

A large proportion of the artifacts found in the quarry are large
bifaces ranging from 3~z~ to 6~ inches (9 to 16 cm.) in length.
Some were made by taking out deep scalloped chips, and others
with flatter flakes. They resemble the large hand-axes of the Paleolithic, particularly the Abbevillian, as shown in Plate 3, A. It
appears that these bifaces were made as part of a sequence of manufacture. They are the cores from which flakes of "Levallois" type
were struck as discussed on a previous page. However, a massive
hiface illustrated in Plate 3, B, was found in a gravel bed in the
Intermediate Alluvium near Locality C, Plate 1. This implement
is worn and stream-rolled but it also shows small chips such as
would result from use on its cutting edge, Plate 3, B).I~’ If this
implement was. actually used, it may be that some of the massive
bifaces were intended for use and were not made merely as stages
in a process.
Several bifaces measuring 5 to 5½ inches (13 to 14 cm.) long have
a massive almost rectangular cross-section (see Plate 4, A). They
resemble crude celts and one of them has been much used so that
its almost square end or pene is much battered. These implements
could not have been effectively used unless halted but no groove or
other indication of a haft is present. Closely related to these axes
are a group of similar size and mass. The cross--section is, however,
I2. In all the illustrations the supposed cutting or useful edge Is placed at the top.
The implements are all repre~l,t~l at exactly half their natural sl~.

lozenge-shaped rather than rectangular. The artifact illustrated in
Plate 4, B, is made of very clear, pearly gray flint and is somewhat smaller than most of the "axes" of this category. In a broad
way, they all resemble rough "celts." They are all so well-~aped
and so thick as to preclude the possibility that they were intended
to be "blanks" from which other implements could be produced. It
may be that they were used in the quarry as hammers although of
the numerous specimens that belong to th~-e two categories only
one shows much use.
The ax.like form represented by the specimen illustrated in
Plate 5, A, has a less massive cross-section and a better edge on all
sides. There are two or three of these specimens which may perhaps
be best regarded as attempts to make an oval blade which were
failures because of too great a thickness.
Five specimens are of unusual interest as they have the general
form of the "axes" previously described although somewhat slimmer in cross-section. All of ahem, however, have the characteristic,
well-brought out in Plate 5, B, that the cutting edge at one end has
an axis offset to the axis of the main part of the implement by 30
degrees. This twist in the axis begins about 1½ inches (4 cm.) from
the end of the implement on all specimens and is obviously an intentional feature. This type has been referred to as the "twisted ax"
largely, because the specimens are about the size and general shape
of the "celt.like" axes. However, it seems more probable that this
is a chiseI-like tool intended to be lmfted up to the point of the
twist. If held in the hand with the axis vertical, the edge beyond
the twist is at right-angles to the axis of the fore-arm. Held in this
fashion, the purpose of the twist appears to be to place the cutting
edge in a convenient position. As none of the specimens show signs
of use, they may all be somewhat imperfectly made and this interpretation may need to be later modified when used specimens have
been found.

artifact.v13 Many of the bifaces of this collection have a welldeveloped cutting edge on one lateral side and a blunt edge on the
other. The specimen illustrated on Plate 6, A, is typical of many
found in the quarry site. The cutting edge is sinuous, formed by
alternately placed, strongly marked chips. The specimen on Plate 8,
A, was found in the Intermediate Alluvium at Localit~ B, Plate 1.
Here the alluvium contains much sidehill slump from the hill adjacent on the west. There are many large chips such as would be produced in making such an implement. The chopper shows no signs
of wear. The specimen illustrated in Plate 7, A, was found in the
cemented gravel of the Intermediate Alluvium near Locality C,
Plate 1. It has been much worn by stream action and there is a
retouch on the cuffing edge as if it had been used.
"Leva//ois" Flakes and Derivative Scrapers
¯ One of the characteristic forms found in the quarry d6bris is a
large flake struck from a biface. These flakes give a pseudo-Paleolithic aspect to the collection as they are associated with large bifaces
of generalized forms like the specimen illustrated in Plate 3, A.
These flakes, as illustrated in Plate 10, A, have on one face the
strongly marked percussion chipping of the large hifaces and on the
other a single conchoidal break showing a strong bulb of percussion.
The size of the bulb of percussion is reduced in this specimen by a
chip which may have broken out at the instant of formation of the
bulb or may have been afterwards struck out. The flake was struck
from a platform having an inclination of about 60 degrees to the
newly struck face. This platform was made by a succession of
definite small chips whose forms are still preser,¢ed. It is obvious
that this flake and its companions were formed by a technique
similar to that of the European Paleolithic. There is, however,
reason to believe that this was merely a stage in the process of
fabrication, of scrapers.
The scraper illustrated in Plate 7, B, was found in the arroyo
bed near Locality A, Plate 1. It had evidently just fallen out of
the bank and still retains some of the calcium carbonate cement
characteristic of the pebbles and artifacts of the Intermediate
Alluvium. The scraper has on one side two broad, flat chips; on

the other side it has a single, not wholly perfect, conchoidal brmak.
Its resemblance to the "Levallois" type of flake rests largely on the
definite chipped and prepared platform from which it was struck.
The edges apparently have been chipped both through intention and
by use. These smaller chips and the main edges and faces are all
water-worn like other artifacts found in this alluvium.
The end-scraper or snub-nosed scraper illustrated in Plate 8, B,
was found in the quarry d~bris. It, also, was struck from a prepared platform on a biface. It has been retouched to give it the
snub-nosed end, but apparently was never used. It seems likely
that it was rejected because the strongly concave chip near the end
gave it a weak edge. The platform is small and, in the illustration,
it is impossible to show the minute and careful chipping by which
it was prepared.
The artifact illustrated in Plate 10, B, was found in the quarry
d~bris. It is roughly similar to the other scrapers in form in that
one side was made by a single conchoidal break from a platform.
The platform is, however, a break on a joint and the face is imperfectly conchoidal. Further, this appears to have been at least the
second flake struck as the main face (left in Plate 10, B) is largely
a conchoidal break. The flake has been retouched so as to form a
good edge and may have been used although the signs of wear are
obscure. In this artifact, the technique is imperfect and also pre.
sumably the material broke more irregularly than the artisan expected.
Points or

Blades

Two specimens from the quarry d~bris are broad, flat blades. The
better one of these specimens is illustrated in Plate 9, A. It is
roughly leabshaped and made by percussion chipping from the
edges of a thin slab of flint bounded by two flat breaks. It seems
likely that fltis is a reject which could not be sufficiently reduced
in thickness. Though rougher and heavier it is not greatly different
in shape from the numerous leaf-shaped blades found in cultures of
various ages in the Plains area.

However, invoking the principle that the youngest types

in a collection of associated artifacts determine the age, it appears
that the presence of the leaf-shaped blades and the end-scraper
places the culture within the known range of New World types. The
forms having the aspect of greatest antiquity are merely stages in
the fabrication of some of the modern types.
In the present state of knowledge, the antiquity of the culture
can be best based on the geological relations.

The culture is defi-

nitely associated with the Intermediate Alluvium from which as yet
no fossil remains have becn obtained. This alluvium is, however,
separated by a period of erosion from a still older alluvium containing remains of a Proboscidian.

It is tempting to correlate the

sequence of alluviation and erosion in this valley with similar
.sequences worked out on other streams in the Southwest.

The re-

suits of such a correlation are shown in Table 1.
It is obvious that the mere proce~ss of tabulation gives a rigidity
and definiteness to the correlation that does not in fact exist.

The

sequence on the Rito de los Encinos is three-fold, but the correlation
with the three-fold Zuni River sequence is without confirmation.
The sequence in the Hopi Country worked out by Hack16 is also
similar but there is no recognizable culture in his No. 2 fill and
this fill may be Puebloan in age as is the earlier of the two fills at
Chaco Canyon.

Furthermore, scattered finds in open sites of thin

oval scrapers and small bifaces suggest the presence of peoples of
non-Puebloan aspect in the Cerro Pedernal area. As these people
are presumably later than those represented by the Los Encinos
culture but also pre-Puebloan, there is further uncertainty on this
point. The correlation with the Alpine and Abilene areas of Texas
seems to be the most perfect. The stone culture of the Calamity
formation is very crude and its affinities will not be plain until
after publication of J. Charles Kelly’s analysis. The Clear Fork
culture is rich in types but it has not yet been proved by excavation

that all of these types are found in the Elm Creek silts.

Much

knowledge of the transition between the relatively rich Clear Fork
culture and the crude culture of the Calamity formation is needed.
Knowledge of the still greater transition to the imperfectly known
Los Encinos culture is required before this correlation is on a firm
archeological basis.

The correlation of the Early Alluvium of this

area with the No. 1 fill of the Hopi Country and the Neville and
Durst silts of Texas is based largely on a common content of Proboscidian remains.

Even this correlation may not be exact as the

Proboscidians as a whole and even the subgroup of Elephants lived
over a long period of time and it is quite possible that beds here
correlated with the Early Alluvium may in fact have been deposited
in several different episodes and in sevdral corresponding periods
of time.
That the Chaco River has two alluviums both of which were deposited in the Puebloan period demonstrates that episodes of alluviation on one stream system may easily be missing on the other streams
and makes us pause in too hasty correlation.

Nevertheless, the table

shows that the sequences of alluviation and erosion are gradually
being brought into relation with each other, and also that, in this
process of correlation, the contained stone cultures provide a criterion of equivalent age which, as knowledge increases, will become
of greater and greater value.

INDIAN PICTURI~S IN TI-I~ DRY SI-I~LT~RS
OF VAL Vt~RD~ COUNTY, T~.XAS
By FOm’~EST

KIRKLAND

Bordering the Rio Grande, and extending roughly about 25 ~niles
east and west of the mouth of the Pecos River and up the stream
about 40 miles, is a semi-desert area, deeply scarred by precipitous
canyons containing innumerable rock shelters and o-,~rhanging
cliffs, which at some time in the past have been occupied by aboriginal man. In many of these dry shelters are still to be found deep
middens; and in front of the flooded shelters and overhanging
cliffs, hearths and burnt rock mounds are often found. Round mortars are found at almost every site. The smooth surface of the rock
walls served as an ideal background for pictures, which are found
in great variety throughout the area.
This region not only surpasses other similar areas of the state
in the number of its picture sites, and the amount of wall space
covered, but also in the great variety of picture types. One tyIm
which is easily recognized, and which represents a very high order
of pictographic art, makes up the greater part of the pictures.
This paper will be limited to a discussion of this predominant type
in the area outlined above, all of which is in Val Verde County,
Texas,
During the last three summers we have examined many shelter~
and other locations in the district, and have made scale copies of the
pictures stilI legible at forty-one sites. Still our work is by no
means finished in the district, because we know of pictures at a halfdozen or more sites which we have not yet visited; and it is more
than likely that other sites will be discovered as the work progresses.
However, the material already at hand should be quite enough to
give us the essential featur~ of the culture.
The writer proposed Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture as a name
for this particular culture, because nearly all of its pictures are on
the walls of dry shelters within the bounds of Val Verde County.
Relationship Between Pictures and Middens
Twenty-nine of the forty-one sites studied in the district contain

48

Teza~ A~’¢h~ologi~al and Paleon~ologica.l Society

pictures of this predominant type.

Twenty-six of these twenty-nine

are dry shelters; one is a flooded shelter; and two are overhanging
cliffs.

Twenty-three of these dry shelters contain middens on their

floors varying in depth from one to more tban ten feet, which points
to a long period of occupation. Pictures are not found in every dry
shelter. Whenever pictures do occur in Shelters containing middens, in this district, we have found them to be with only one exception, of the Val Verde Dry Shelter type. These pictures are found
exclusively in twenty-one mSdden bearing shelters, and, although
there are many pictures of other types in the district, they are associated with the Dry Shelter pictures in only two of the twenty-three
midden bearing shelters. These facts disclose a very close connection between the Dry Shelter pictures and the middens, and seem to
indicate that the pictures were produced by the same inhabitants that
built up the middens.
This view is substantiated by the additional fact that in several
cases the pictures are partly or completely covered by the deposit.
In one case we were able to copy a large d~gn that had been
uncovered by a deep trench against the wall. In many shelters the
midden extends up to the very bottoln of the pictures, although it
appears most likely that the pictures were painted when they were
at a convenient height above the floor level. In these cases, almost
all of the lower pictures have been dmnaged or destroyed by close
contact of the inhabitants during the years necessary for the midden
to reach its final level.
Type o] Material in the Middens
We have made no attempt to dig at any of the sites, but have observed a similarity of material around the holes left by amateur
collectors in many of the middens. Straw, dried leaves, quids of
vegetable matter, fragments of basketry, pieces of twine, and knotted
grass are corot-non. Two of the shelters containing only pictures of
the Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture have been partly excavated and
reported upon. One in the Seminole Canyon was explored by the
PLATE 11.

painted over solid red to get a polka dot effect. Another interest.
ing use of polka dots~ was on the robes of two figures in a nearby
canyon. Tbe dots were small outline circles of black on a yellow
background.
Typical ~lnthropomorphic Figure

As individual and highly developed as the polychrome painting
of this culture was, it does not equal the uniqueness of its designs
and human representations. The outstanding example of these is
the typical anthropomorphic figure, which is found in various forms
at almost every site. There are hundreds of these figures in sizes
from a few inches in height to more than eight feet, and frequently
in two or three colors.
The commonest form is an extremely elongated figure, sometimes
with sides parallel, but usually broader at the shoulders, with arms
on opposite sides of the body, extended at right angles or slightly
raised; the legs, if present, extending downward in line with the
outside edge of the body (Plates 11, 12). The fingers and tt,~s
are indicated with from three to five parallel lines extending straight
out from t.he ends of the arms and legs. Sometimes the feet are plctured more realistically at right angles to the legs, or like tracks
underneath the legs. The head is never realistically pictured. It
may be anything from a deer head mask to an oval, a square, a
series of dots or lines; or it may be omitted altogether (Plate 12).
Feathers, or plumes sometimes extend upward from the head. Various kinds of fringes, banners or decorations are usually suspended
from one or both arms; while one or both wrists may be decorated
with an ornate wristband. One hand, usually the left, holds a staff,.
while the other grasps what resembles a broken flowering plant
(Plates 11, 12).
The color and decoration of the robe worn by the figure seems
to have depended on the individual taste of the artist. However, a
few features that are often found may be worthy of note. A fringe,
sometimes in alternating colors, may extend partly or completely
around the robe; a simple or elaborate panel often appears on the
5.

Kirkland, 195~a: Plate I.

56

T~ras A~’¢h¢ologlcal and Paleontological Society

front of the garment; infrequently a muhiple sash (Plate 12, No. 3)
extends from the robe at low waist line.
In numerous instances, a cape, or wing-like extension of the robe
projects some distance beyond the shoulders. In this case the hands
of the figure project upward from the shoulders. In extre~ne cases
of conventionalization the figure resembles a tri-motor airplane.6
This robe is evidently a part of a special ceremonial costume, because it is usually elaborately decorated, and sometimes worn with a
deershead mask.
While the figure is usually shown facing forward with arms on
opposite sides of the body, it may appear in profile with both arms
extending from the same side (Plate 12, No. 1, 2). !n which case,
the usual arm and wrist decorations are seen and the hands may
grasp either the staff or the broken flower.
Another form occasionally found is identical from the waist up
with the first described; but the lower part of the body is entirely
omitted (Plate 13, No. 2). The fringe, if present, extends entirely
around the body at the waist like a fringe on the bottom of a coat.
The typical anthropomorphic figure is subject to so many modifications and conventionalizations that it sometimes loses its human
aspect and becomes merely a desig~n (Plate 16; No. 3, 4, 5) ; but
there will always be prbsent an extended staff, recognizable arms or
legs, arm decorations or some other common attribute that definitely
links it with the typical anthropomorphic idea.
Other Human Representations
While this figure is outstanding and unique to the culture, it is
¯ by no means the only human representation. Another very common
figure is usually small, seldom painted with more than one color,
and lacking such details as feet, fingers, and shaped head (Plate 13;
6.

Kirkland, 1938 ; pp. 20-23 (Plate 2, Nos. I~5).

No. 2, 3). The body is usually short with parallel sides and square
bottom. A curved top generally serves for a head. The legs extend
straight downward from the sides of the body or may flair outward.
The arms are straight marks on each side of the body, sometimes
at right angles, but frequently extending downward.
An interesting variation of this figure has a slightly bulging body
with two appendages at the top resembling rabbit ears.7 These
figures have been referred to as rabbitsS; but, in view of the frequent use of similar appendages on the anthropomorphic figure, it
seems more likely that they were also intended to represent men.
Perhaps the most unusual figure in the culture is one that appears to represent a man in an anilnal mask. Its body is almost
round. It has hands and feet and sometimes the usual arm decorations. The head is never very well defined; but it possesses two,
usually fringed, tail-like appendages between, or on each side of the
legs (Plate 12; No. 2, 3). Individual variations of this figure are
very marked; but the fact that they represent the same being is
unmistakable.
Other less distinctive human representations are generally related
to one of the above forms.
Phallic Representations
We have found no phallic representations of any kind in the
culture. Phallic figures are present at only two sites, and they
unquestionably belong to other cultures. No sex distinctions are
recognizable in any of the pictures.
Handprints
Handprints are found at only three Val Verde Dry Shelter sites.
At one they are with the pictures of a more recent culture. The
other two sites, containing only a few handprints, are located very
near a large flooded shelter site of a different culture, which contains many handprints. We believe, therefore, that these were intrusions and that handprints were not made by the Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture. There is, however, a common design among their pic7.

tures, painted with a brush, which resembles a handprint (Plate 12;
No. 2). It probably represents an animal track.
Pictures o] the Puma
Unlike the highly conventionalized human figure of the culture,
many of the animal pictures are exceptionally realistic. This is
especially true of the puma, or Mexican lion, which seems to have
held an important place in the culture. One life sized picture9 of
this animal is remarkable for its graceful pose and realism. The
average picture, however, is fairly crude (Plates 11, 13) with long
body, graceful, erect or arching tail; but with stiff straight legs.
The mouth is usually open, ears erect, and bristles raised. Claws
are usually present; but the eye is seldom expressed. Some conventionalizations are found in which only the general form remains.
At several sites, these puma pictures occupy the most prominent
part of the shelter and are grouped with an anthropomorphic figure
as if to illustrate a myth (Plate 13, No. 1). In these cases the length
of the animal may exceed 16 feet from nose to tip of tail.
Pictures o! Deer
As in many other Indian cultures, the deer played an important
part in the thoughts of the Val Verde Dry Shelter people, if we may
judge by the number of deer pictures on their shelter walls. These
pictures are small, seldom more than two feet long, and much less
conspicious than those of the puma, but more numerous. The body
is usually an oval; the legs straight lines placed so as to express
action; the toes are pictured, as are also horns, ears, and tail. The
animals are generally represented in droves extending across the
shelter wall (Plate 11, No. 2). It is interesting to note that many
of the deer are shown pierced with a long spear, while the puma and
other animals seldom are. Deer horns are also an important feature
in several elaborate designs.lO
Serpents, Birds, and Fish
Realistic serpent pictures are found at many sites, and doubtless

point to the meaning of the wavy, or serpentine lines which are found
in great numbers. In many ca~s, these lines consist of two or three
tangent, parallel lines of different colors. They may appear alone
(Plate 13; No. 3), extending fifteen or twenty feet across the wall;
or they may be combined with other elements in simple or very intricate designs.11 Besides the typical anthropomorphic figure, these
serpentine lines ~are, perhaps, the easiest means of recognizing the
culture.
Pictures of nondescript birds in flight are sometimes found (Plate
16; No. 2). They are usually small and in groups.
We have found no recognizable pictures of fish; although fish
bones are very common, and cactus spine fish hooks have been
found12 in the middens. One site, however, in the Seminole Canyon contains a small picture of two men fishing (Plate 17). One
has definitely hooked a turtle; the end of the other line has unfortunately been flaked away. Other pictures in the shelters resemble
turtles.
EebL~ke zlnimals
We have recognized another animal representation which is
unique, and may illustrate a mythological idea. Its typical form is
an extremely elongated animal, usually accompanied by three or
more much smaller animals. In its most realistic form the larger
animal, which may measure fifteen feet in length, resembles an eel,
somewhat, with open mouth, fins at each side of the head, and a fishlike tail. Any one of these features may be absent, however, or
highly conventionalized; and there may be more than one of the
large animals, side by side (Plate 15, No. 2). The small animals,
never more than a few inches long, have oblong bodies, four legs;
but very rarely a head. In their most realistic form they resemble a
frog, but ordinarily they are so highly conventionalized that they
loose entirely their animal aspect. In one instance, the long animal
has legs with toes, as do, also, the small animals; and all have feather
decorations at the head (Plate 16, No. 2).
Except for a few unimportant, nondescript, animal pictures,

there remain only the so-called insect pictures, which are occasionally found. This classification covers many odd designs po.~essing
some animalistic feature such as feet, head, antenna or tail; but
which are wholly unlike any existing animal or insect. In view of
the many bizarre forms of the anthropomorphic figure, and the general tendency toward conventionalization in the culture, it seems
more likely that these "insect" pictures are only extremel~ fantastic
representations of comanon animals.
Feather-like objects are of frequent occurrence (Plate 13, No. 3),
usually rather large, from one to three feet in length. They consist
of a central stem surrounded by fine parallel lines often of alternating colors. They are the chief element in several very large intricate designs, and are commonly used as head decorations. They
are sometimes associated with the serpent, and, in one case, form a
distinct plume at the serpent’s head. In some instances they 1nay
as likely represent plant forms.
Plant Representations
Plant representations are common, but are usually so highly conventionalized that the exact plant cannot be identified. The most
conspicuous form is flue staff held by the anthropomorphic figure.
The stem, almost always a double line, has no leaves but bears a
large plume, or blossom at its extreme end. The body of this blossom is usually oval in shape, but varies so in its decorations that no
two are exactly alike. Occasionally this blossom and stem are found
alone, in which case, the stem may have leaves. It is also the chief
element in several large designs,la
The broken plant, usually held opposite the staff, has a single
line for its stem, bent at right angles near its center. The leaf may
be either a realistic leaf, a simple line, a series of lines; or it may
be absent. The flower, when present, is always an elongateM oval
crossed lengthwise by the stem, near its extreme end. This same
simple device serves as the blossom in the picture of a complet~e

plant, resembling the lechiquilla, at one site (Plate 17) ; and is frequently found at the end of a staff extending from a circle, or disc,
sometimes surrounded by a heavy fringe (Plate 16, No. 1). These
unique objects resembling certain desert plants are generally found
in groups and in combinations with other elements of design. They
may represent the flowering sotol, a plant of great importance to the
inhabitants of the shelters.
Various other plant-like designs are found which resemble grass,
cactus, ferns, clover, etc.; but they are of too little importance to
warrant more than a mere mention here.
Pictures o] Spears

Only a few tools and other objects of manufacture other than
clothing, which has already been discussed, are recognizable among
the pictures of the Dry Shelter culture. Chief among these is the
spear, which is seen protruding from the bodies of many of the deer,
and of human figures, and is frequently pictured alone (Plate 11,
No. 2). The head of the spear is always shown, and, occasionally,
the feathered shank is pictured in some detail.~5 In most cases,
the spear head is drawn exactly like the simple flower described
above--an elongated oval, crossed lengthwise by the shaft near
end. This makes it impossible to determine in ruany cases whether
the picture was intended to represent a spear or a flowering stalk.
However, in the case of the hundreds of spear-like objects which are
shown falling in showers across shelter walls (Plate 12, No. 3),
and are incorporated in many different kinds of designs, it seems
most likely that they represent spears, or darts of some kind.
Th~ Bow and the ¢ltlatl
It is interesting to note that the bow is pictured at only one of the
Val Verde Dry Shelter sites, and there it unquestionably belongs
to the work of a later culture which overlaps the Dry Shelter pictures.]~ This agrees with the evidence from the middens that the
bow and arrow were not used by these people, but, instead, the
atlatl and spear were their chief weapon. We have, however, found
no pictures that can positively be identified as an atlatl and spear

in use. Some observers have thought that the staff, or broken plant
held by the anthropomorphic figure might be an atlatll 7; but the
great similarity of these objects to plant forms, when they are shown
in detail, seems to discredit this idea. There are, however, several
pictures at different sites closely resembling £nodern swords with
blades, hilts, and guards (Plate 13, No. 3; Plate 15, No. 3). These
pictures conform just as well to the general outlines of the atlatl,
and may very likely represent that weapon without the spear.
There are no historical motifs among the pictures of this culture.
Decorative, or Geometrical Forms
In addition to the naturalistic pictures, there are several purely
decorative, or geometrical forms that had an important place in the
designs of the culture. One of these consists of a line six or eight
inches long crossed at equal intervals by from three to five shorter
lines of the same color. This device is used on scores of designs
and figures in many ways, but chiefly as a fringe or decoration on
garments (Plate 12, No. 2).
Stipples are often used on designs. Long lines of red stipples
that look as if the color had been slung from a brush, are found at
many sites. And, no doubt, the color was slung from the brush in
most cases; but in several instances the length of the line and the
curve it makes, seems to indicate that it could only have been accomplished by hand stippling. Occasionally, these red stipples extend
from spears or wounds,18 and very likely represent blood.
Fine parallel lines, frequently in alternating colors, are a distinguishing feature. They are found in one form or another at nearly
every site and in almost every important design.
Wavy lines, so common in the culture, have already been discussed under serpents.

line or the edge of a solid body, are a common element of design
used in many of the compositions (Plate 14). Individual squares
or triangles, however, are seldom found.
Dots and circles were frequently used as decorations and as parts
of designs, but are seldom found alone; and never in the forms
termed "sun emblems" commonly found among the pictures of
other cultures.
The outstanding artistic achievement of the Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture, is not its individual figures and forms; but the skillful
way these elements have been combined into elaborate, beautifully
balanced designs and compositions.19 These compositions vary
in size from a few feet, to as much as twenty feet long, and half as
high.
No two designs are alike, yet many of them seem to follow some
fixed pattern, like, for example, t_he so called "map" pictures.2O
Another pattern mentioned above is the eel-like animal group.
There is also the arch shaped design, consisting of a circle, square
or other element at the top, with wavy lines descending on each side
to form the arch. Suspended underneath the arch is usually some
animalistic figure21; in one case the eel-like animal groups. The
suspended object may be absent.
Pictures Hlu~trating Myths
Some of the designs seem to be purely decorative while others,
containing animal or human forms, appear to illustrate mythological ideas. This is especially true of the anthropomorphic figure
which is often shown, either with animals over its head like a halo22
or at its feet. It is sometimes pictured between a group of puma
as if it were their trainer (Plate 13, No. 1).
We can never hope to know the exact interpretation of these mythological conceptions; but the fact that they represent deep seated
traditions of the people instead of individual ideas of the artist, is
proven by the fact that each conception is repeated over and again
in different forms throughout the district.

The Question o] the Cultures Origin
These firmly fixed mythological ideas and the highly conventionalized forms with which they are illustrated, along with the extremely individual style of painting, seem to point to a very long
period of development. The question naturally arises: was this
culture with its elaborate paintings slowly evolved in the district
around the mouth of the Pecos, or was it evolved elsewhere and
brought in fully developed?
There is some evidence that the first pictures painted at the sites
were simple, solid, light red figures lacking the detail and individuality of the later work (Plate 14). But if the very elaborate polychrome pictures evolved from these, we have been unable to trace
the development. The highly evolved figures appear to be as often
buried or badly weathered as the simpler forms that should have
preceded them; and the more realistic figures from which the conventional ones should have evolved, are not found at all. The
present evidence, therefore, although by no means conclusive, points
to an outside development.
If the culture was brought to the district already well developed,
there should be similar, though simpler, pictures from whence it
canle, which we should be able to recognize readily with the materim we now have at hand. The midden material points to the Basket Makers as the source of the culture and there seems to be a
similarity between the square shouldered man of the Basket Makers
and the typical figure of the Val Verde Dry Shelter culture; but a
great deal more material will have to be gathered on the Basket
Maker pictures before a solution of this problem is possible.
\Ve made a preliminary survey of sites in Brewster County, Texas,
where a basket-maker-like culture is found, but no pictures sinfilar
to the Val Verde Dry Shelter pictures were found. One shelter
which we studied in Bee Cave Canyon had been scientifically excavatedz3 and a culture similar to that in the lower Pecos region
23.

reported, but the pictures in the shelter were in no way similar to
those here described.
If it is found that no relation exists between these and the Basket
Maker pictures and if similar but more primitive pictures are not
discovered elsewhere, we must accept the theory that the culture
evolved in the district, or else believe it originated down the Rio
Grande, as has already been suggested from a study of the skeletal
material,~4 or in some other district where rock cliffs were not
available. In that case we would conclude that the highly developed
art evolved on perishable materials which were destroyed long ago.
The difficult thing to explain in that case will be why no objects in
the middens contain pictures similar to those on the shelter wails.
Conclusion

In view of the evidence cited above, it see~ns reasonable to believe: (1) that the very dim, highly conventionalized pictures in the
dry shelters in Val Verde County are the work of a basket-makerlike people who inhabited the shelters over a long period before historic time; (2) that the pictures represent a very high standard of
pictographic art; (3) that many of the designs illustrate well estab.
lished mythological ideas; (4) that the style of work as well as the
type of figures is so unique that the culture can readily be recognized wherever it is found; (5) that the origin of the culture presents a problem that deserves a great deal more study.

LAKE SITES OF THE SOUTH PLAINS
OF TEXAS
W. C. WATTS
It has been said that civilizations stand upon three legs: land,
timber, and water. With respect to these three the Plains Indians of
the Llano Estacado had an abundance of grass-covered land, no timher, and a scarcity of water. Had it not been for the enormous
bison herds and other herbivorous animals which frequented the
territory for grazing, the red man wouId have had little eaus~ for
inhabiting the region.
The scarcity of water was the outstanding handicap. South of the
Canadian River and the Pale Duro there are no perpetual rivers to
supply water. Except for shallow excavations in the sand hill
region, the Indians did not dig wells into the vast stratum of water
underlying the Plains. This source of water, reached by wells, is
the thing that eventually made it possible for the white man to move
into the territory and develop it.
This underground water makes its way to the surface through
the wails of the canyons and those of the "alkali" lakes of the territory in the form of springs. These springs supply water for two of
the four types of sites where evidences of Indian habitation are
found.
A third type is shown by the sites which follow th~ sand hills in
their east to west course across the Plains. According to Bryan1
th~-e sand hills follow an old Pleistocene river bed. Here the
water crone so close to the surface that the later Indians were able
to obtain it for use. The reference is made here to later Indians, for
Bryan believes that below the sand hills, in the old river bed, will
be found evidence of Pleistocene man. He believes this river is a
continuation of the same formation whic~ passes between Clovis,
New Mexico, and Portales, New Mexico, where Howard and Cotter
have reported evidences of Pleistocene man.
The fourth type of Indian camps are those sites which are found
near the "surface" lakes of the territory. These lakes are not shown

on the map, but are widely distributed over the entire area. There
are few sections that do not have one or more of these surface lakes.
Three such lakes lie within the city limits of Lubbock.
It might appear from listing these four sources: canyon springs,
"alkali" lake springs, sand hills, and surface lakes, that water would
be abundant. However, this is not the case. The springs emptying
into the canyons and "alkali" lakes supply only a limited amount of
water and the surface lakes are filled only during rainy seasons.
Therefore, at any place on the South Plains where water is more or
less permanent, one is certain to find evidences of Indian habitation.
We have, then, four types of sites according to the four sources of
water.
This report is concerned primarily with the camp sites near the
"alkali" lakes. The term lake as here used is a bit misleading, because the "alkali" lakes are not lakes as known in most sections of
this country. The most conspicuous thing about them is the absence
of water. They may cover several square miles in area, but water
is rarely found in them except near the small springs coming from
the escarpment. Their dry, level beds glisten with gypsum and
alkali. (See Plate 19, Panel A, No. 1).
A view of one of these lakes shows up rather suddenly. They
are surrounded by an abrupt drop in the land, often f~rming a steep
escarpment. In most cases the Tertiary is completely missing and
outcroppings df the Lower Cretaceous are found at the base of the
escarpment. This depression from the level surface of the Plains
offered protection for the Indian camps.
From the map (see Plate 18), one notices that with the exception
of Shafter Lake and Cedar Lake, the "alkali" lakes form two
groups, one near the head of Yellowhouse Creek, and the other
group in Lynn and Terry Counties. Of this latter group Rich Lake,
Tahoka Lake and Twin Lakes were among the last sites of the South
Plains to be occupied by the Indians. Captain R. G. Carter of
Washington, the last surviving officer of the old Fourth U. S. Cavalry under the command of General R. S. Mackenzie, shows on a

map outlining their various expeditions the following contacts with
these lakes.

The detachment left the supply camp and camped at

Tahoka Lake on December 4, 1874.

The next day they proceeded

to Rich Lake where they had action with Indians.

It was possibly

a minor encounter, for they moved on to the canyon near Lubbock
the following day.

As to Twin Lakes, Frank P. Hill2 of the Lynn County News,
Tahoka, Texas, reports that the last Indian encounter on the South
Plains occurred there in 1879. It is also from Twin Lakes that the
ill-fated Tenth U. S. Colored Cavalry departed on the trail of Indians in 1877. Cook3 tells of how they ran out of water and wandered for 96 hours trying to find an additional supply. Five members of the group died of thirst before making their way back to the
original camp.
From these references it is seen that Indian occupation of the
"alkali" lakes dates well into historic times.
This writer has collected from each of the three camp sites mentioned above; however, he does not have an extensive collection from
Tahoka Lake and Twin Lakes. From Rich Lake he has over 300
artifacts which will be described in t~s paper. When the "alkali"
lakes are referred to as a type, it has reference only to their geological formation. Whether Rich Lake represents a cultural type it
would be impossible to say until more extensive study is made of the
other lake sites.
Rich Lake is on the western edge of the Terry and Lynn County
group of lakes. Because of its location it occupies a strategic place
with respect to the other lakes as well as to the sites along the Yellowhouse canyon. On its northwest side a small spring seeps from
the lower wall of the escarpment. This spring supplied a limited
amount of water for the camp which was located some 400 yards
from the spring. As a reason for this separation of camp and
spring, it is possible that game used the same source of water, and
as the Indians had their camp at a distance, the game would come

close to it seeking water. The camp follows the lake shore for 200
yards, and extends about the same distance back from it. Being on
the first elevation above the lake bottom, it is well below the level
of the Plains. This offered a degree of protection in that the camp
could not have been seen until one came near the edge of the escarpment.
ArtiJacts ]rein Rich Lake
Points
A total of 137 projectile points were collected at the camp. Most
of these are complete. Only those fragments are included in the
survey where enough of the point remains to identify its base and
general shape. The exact use of all of these points is difficult to
say; some of the larger ones may have been used as knives. Kidder
makes the following comments concerning points of the southwest:
All prehistoric stone-headed arrows so far found in the
southwest bear points weighing less than 35 grains.
That at Pete8 and other former settlements of the arrowusing Pueblo peoples there occur hundreds of points of
comparable weight for every one of the larger.

(3)

That at the pueblo sites such large points as have been
found halted have usually been set in short handles for
use as knives, but never as arrows.

( )

That small points, which can hardly have been other than
arrow-haads, appear in great quantity among the bones of
slaughtered buffalo in the trap-ravines of the Great
Plains, while on the other hand, the heads of all Basketmaker spear-throwing darts that have come to light are
much larger and heavier than those which we can be sure
were arrow-heads.’’z;

At Rich Lake we find as many of the large points as we do the
smaller ones. Using 35 grains as a criterion for separation, 69 of
the 137 points are heavier and 68 lighter than 35 grains. Dividing
the 69 larger points (See Plate 19, Panel B.), according to Renaud,5

five of these are of Type I, stemless, and 65 are of Type II, stemmed.
There are none of Type III among the larger points. The five of
Type I appear to be the oldest artifacts from the site. Four of the
five are possibly Folsom fragments. The fifth is not of Folsom type
but it is heavily patinated. These four possible Folsom frag~nents
along with another more complete point from the same site, belonging to Frank Jackson of E1 Paso, were sent to J. D. Figgins, then
Director of the Colorado Museum of Natural History. In a letter
to the writer, dated October 8, 1934, he classified the five points as
"undoubtedly referable to the Folsonl culture." These points are
surface finds. They may have been brought in from other sites or
they may have eroded from the present camp site.
Of the remaining 65 larger points, 42 have shoulders with barbs
and 23 are without barbs. Some of these show evidence of having
been re-sharpened, a practice of the Indians of this territory where
flint is scarce. Two of the larger points were made of obsidian,
which probably was brought from New Mexico, and six are of flint
from Alibates Creek, of the Canadian River. One point is of chert,
one of petrified wood, twelve are of brown flint and 43 of gray to
black flint. One point is of quartzite.
Of the 68 small points of weights less than 35 grains which came
from the site (see Plate 19, Panel B.) fifteen are of Type I, 20 are
of Type II, and 33 are of Type III (20 with lateral notches and
13 with basal notches in addition to the lateral notch). The Type
III basal points are also found in the sand hills, in the Pueblo
ruins, and in the slab-house culture of the Canadian River.
Scrapers
Of scrapers 64 came from the site, and of the~ 38 are end ~rapers
which vary in si~ and shape as shown in (Plate 19, Panel C.). One
of these is a scraper which is heavily patinated. In addition, this
scraper shows no evidence of pressure flaking which is common to
the unpatinated scrapers. (See Plate 19, Panel C, Figure 13).
Twenty-five side scrapers, and one shaft scraper, were found in
the site.
Punches and Drills
Ten punches and drills were found in the site.

Five are drills,

84

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Socle~y

one of which is fragmentary, and five are punches, four of which
are fragraentary. (See Plate 19, Panel C, Figures 1 and 2).
Knives

Twelve knives were found in the site, five of which were fragmentary. (See Plate 19, Panel C). Two of the knives are beveled and
made of flint from Alibates Creek, a branch of the Canadian River.
One is Type D (see Figure 4), and the other is a variation of Type
C (see Figure 3), according to Poteet’s6 system of classification.
Poteet’s classification has Type C as diamond shaped. This particular knife is diamond shaped, yet there is a short protrusion on
one face which seems to be functional. Poteet makes no mention of
such a variation. Two knives showing similarity in shape came
:from slab,house ruins of the Canadian River. One is from the
Antelope Creek ruins, excavated by E. J. Lowrey, and is exhibited
in the West Texas Museum in Lubbock. The other came from the
Saddle.Back ruin. A’picture of tiffs knife will be found in Holden’s7 description of the site. Porter Montgomery has two knives
from Dalhart, Texas, which also suggest this modification.

Obieets o/Stone
Some of the most interesting specimens of the collection are
found among the stone artifacts. This group includes a pendant
made of a hard slate-like rock. (See Plate 19, Panel C, Figure 10).
The finding of this pendant came about under rather unusual circumstances. It had been broken into halves by a plow. Mrs. Watts

found the top half at one time, and a year later she found the bottom half.

Its extreme simplicity, its symmetry, and the beautiful

cur~,es of its sides, make it a work of art.
The pendant is seven centimeters long and 1.8 centimeters wide.
It appears to have been ground into form. There is a striation in
the rock which has been arranged to blend with tile general contour
of its shape, The hole at the top is bored from both directions.
This is a characteristic found among the later Puebloan cultures;
however, it is doubtful that the pendant is of Puebloan origin. The
writer could find no duplicate of it at the museums in Santa Fe, and
the curators could throw no Iight upon its origin. Kidders reports
that in his excavation of Pecos ruins he found that pendants of stone
were exceedingly rare, with the exception of those of turquoise.
This pendant from Rich Lake, even though it is more rectangular,
shows some similarity to pendants reported by Ray9 from a cremated burial near Colorado, Texas.
FtuskeylO reports finding scored stones in "Mound A" of the
Nucces Canyon of Texas. One such artifact is in the writer’s collection from Rich Lake. (See Plate 19, Panel A, Figure 2). The
stone is thirteen centimeters long, eight centimeters wide and four
and one-half centimeters thick on one edge, the opposite edge being
narrower, in fact highly rounded. On the wider edge are seven lines
scratched parallel with the face of the stone.
No whole metate was found. The fragments found at the camp
appear to come from two general types. One is large, thin, flat,
and made of sandstone. The other is thicker, smaller in diameter,
and made of a harder type of stone.
There are three general types of manos. The most common are
of quartzite river stones, and are relatively thick and oval in shape.
A second type is round, thin, and often slightly convex along one
axis. This type ranges from five to seven inches in diameter. The

third type of mano is more rectangular in shape, and is usually flat
on one face and convex along one axis on the opposite face.
In ,the collection is found a thin sandstone artifact which is oval
in shape, five and one-half inches long and three and one-half inches
wide. One face is convex to the longer axis and the opposite face
is concave to the sarne axis. There is another small flat rectangular
stone, one edge of which has been ground to a sharp bevel.
Chert is the principal stone used for harmner stones. Two small
hand axes were found which also are made of chert. Another chert
artifact is crudely shaped, similar to a Celtic cross. (See Plate 19,
Panel C, Figure 9).
There is one sandstone artifact which probably is of Puebloan
origin. It is a spherical ball one and three-eighths inches in diameter. The writer has in his collection another such sphere seveneighths of an inch in diameter, taken from a camp near Post. Kidder reports thirty such specimens from the Pecos ruins. He describes
them thus:
"Most of these are almost perfectly spherical, but their shape is
apparently in every case natural. None are battered, nor do any
show smooth areas or wear.facets. The size-range in the thirty
specimens collected is from seven-eighths of an inch to three and
one.fourth inches, with an almost perfect gradation between the
extremes. Possible use might have been: in games; as kick.stones;
or as slingshot beads; or their roundness may have had esthetic or
even ceremonial attraction.’’11
Paint rock is relatively abundant. Fossiliferous limonite from
the lower Cretaceous is the source of the paint rock.
Bone Implements
Bone implements are scarce even though the camp contains quite
a bit of bone that is highly mineralized. Two bone implements are
shown in (Plate 19, Panel C, Figures 11 and 12). From Tahoka
Lake the writer has one six inch bone awl which is complete.

Pottery
The writer has neither found pot sherds at Tahoka Lake nor at
Twin Lakes. At Rich Lake only two sherds from but two pots have
been found. So far as these three "alkali" lakes are concerned, evidences of pottery are not as common as at the other three types
of South Plains camp sites.
Rims from the two pots from Rich Lake were identified by Dr. N.
S. Stallings of the Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New
Mexico. One is a Brownware, which was distributed through southern New Mexico and West Texas, from 900 to 1400 A. D. The
second is the exuberant black, Corrugated Puebloan, ware.
Puebloan pottery is abundant in the sand hills and in the surface lakes. It is also in the canyon sites near Lubbock. Mr. Stallings of the Laboratory of Anthropology at Santa Fe identified the
following sherds of the writer’s collection coming from canyon sites
within ten miles of Lubbock.
From Buffalo Springs one sherd was of Glaze I Red, of aberrant
paste. It is unusual and may have been made locally. From Boles
ranch, sherds from two camps were identified. One camp had a
Rio Grande Glaze, F?, twelfth century to early eighteenth century.
The other camp had an earlier pottery. One sherd was an areal
phase of Mera "Ceramic Clues"--1306 A. D. to 1375 A. D. It
occurs south of Albuquerque and is a mixture of Socorro and Mesa
Verde Black on White. Other sherds were Chupadero, Black on
White, 1200 A. D. to 1650 A. D. A third type of sherd was of Three
Rivers, Red-on-Terracotta from around Alamogordo. It had a wide
trade range during the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries.
From a surface lake five miles north of Lubbock, near the juneture of the Yellowhouse, and Black Water Draw, thirteen sherds
have been found which represent four different pots. According to
Dr. Stallings two of these pots are of the E1 Paso Brown (900 A. D.
to i400 A. D. or later), five of the sherds are from a Rio Grande
Glaze II (fifteenth century). Six are of Chupadero Black on White,
which have a range through Eastern Arizona, Northern Chihuahua,
New Mexico, and Texas (twelfth to seventeenth centuries), with the
maximum expansion in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

Summary and Conclusions
Rich Lake appears to have a mixture of several cultures. Puebloan influence is suggested in the black exuberant corrugated pottery, the four obsidian points, the spherical sandstones, and the
prevalence of small Type III basal arrow-heads. Puebloan pottery,
however, is found more along the Yellowhouse Canyon and its
near-by "surface" lakes than at the "alkali" lakes of Lynn and Terry
Counties. This might suggest that the course of the Yellowhouse
was used by the Puebloans as a guide and as a water supply as they
crossed the level and uncharted high plains, and that the "alkali"
lakes were visited less frequently.
Pottery distribution on the South Plains needs to be more thoroughly studied to find the extent of Puebloan influence.
Canadian River influence can be seen at Rich Lake. The small
Type III basal arrow-heads mentioned above are also found in the
slab-house culture of this river as well as in the sand hills. Another
suggestion of Canadian River influence is the occurrence of flint
from Alibates Creek. 7.7 percent of the flint artifacts from Rich
Lake are of Alibates flint. The variation of the Type C beveled
knife found at Rich Lake and in the slab-house culture might warrant further study.
The scored stone is similar to those from the Nueces Canyon. The
stone pendant is somewhat like those taken from the cremated burial
near Colorado, Texas.
The gray and brown flint probably came from the Edwards plateau to the south and southeast. There is no flint in this immediate
portion of the South Plains.
The Brown-ware shows an influence from the southwest, possibly
from around El Paso.
The five fragments referable to Folsom suggest age. The other
large Type I stemless point from the camp is not Folsom, but is
highly patinated. One end scraper from the site is heavily patinated
and shows crude percussion flaking.
The writer ventures one hypothesis as to the "alkali" lakes.

No

one people lived at the lake sites over a long period of time; however, the camps must have been occupied often by first one culture,
then another. The apparent mixture of cultures and the absence of
evidence of permanent houses support this hypothesis. These various peoples could have occupied the camps while passing across
the Plains or as hunting headquarters during the buffalo season.
Much more study needs to be made of sites on the South Plains.
The degree of influence exerted by bordering cultures as well as
features of cultural similarity between the four geographical types
of sites need to be determined.

FURTHER EXCAVATIONS OF THE GAHAGAN
MOUND; CONNECTIONS WITH A
FLORIDA CULTURE

Reporting his mound excavations along Red River in northwestern
Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas, Moore (1) in 1912 noted an
unusual culture in a burial mound at Gahagan, Louisiana, which is
located 40 miles south of Shreveport.

Fine stone work, copper

ornaments and scanty pottery ware contrasted decidedly with the
profuse pottery and shell wares in the burial sites farther up the
river, later identified as Caddom~ (2).

Recent discovery of additional burial pits in this mound affords
further details of this unique and highly developed culture.
The S~te

At Gahagan an old river channel is joined from the west by a
small stream (Plate 20, No. 1). About one-half mile downstream,
in the old Hollingsworth field, is a small mound (A), which is approximately 10 feet high, and 80 feet in diameter. Moore (1) stated
the mound was round-topped when he visited it in 1911. He stated,
"In aboriginal times a considerable population must have inhabited
this place, to judge from the number of remnants of rnounds that
are scattered throughout the fields." Continuous cultivation has
left only two other low mounds (B and C) and numerous circular
sandy areas, presumably representing the remains of house mounds.
Pottery sherds are found in these sandy areas and along the streams,
but artifacts are not found in the fidds elsewhere. These probably
have been covered by overflow deposits.
Previous Excavation

Moore found in Mound A one large central burial pit, 13 by 9
feet 8 inches, extending downward 11 feet from the summit (Burial
Pit 1, Plate 20). With five skeletons were 63 chipped stone blades;

22 small arrow points; three celts; a boatstone of diabase; many
bone pins; four ornaments of sheet copper, several tubular beads,
a rattle and two ear discs, all of copper-covered wood. There were
one pottery vase and two bottles, decorated with finely incised parallel lines forming circles and diagonal bands, separated by incised
triangles, all containing red pigment; and a human effigy pipe ;f
pottery, which had a tunnel from the pipe bowl to the figurine’s
mouth, suggesting a combination pipe and cloud-blower.
Present Excavatiop.s--B~rial Pit 2
In 1938, while securing sherds for classification, we found fragments of a vessel on the western slope of Mound A. Investigation
showed a white sand layer which was intersected sharply by a charcoal-streaked red clay and sand mixture, the fill of Burial Pit 2
(Plates 20 and 21). The pit, 19a/~ by 15 feet, extended downward
8 feet from the summit, lying under the slope, and had a level floor
covered with white and yellow sand.
Within the pit fill and near the surface, an intrusive burial of an
adolescent was surrounded by an outline of hand-wrought nails,
evidently a white or negro interment of the past century. A second
intrusive burial into the pit fill (Plate 21, Skeleton 7) lay at a
depth of 6 feet from the summit. This was of an adult male, 5 feet
11 inches in length, supine and fully extended, as were all of the
burials described subsequently. At each side of the head was a
large copper-covered stone ear disc (Plate 28, No. 3, 4) and outside
the left knee was a pile of 61 small arrow points (Plate 28, No. 1,
Row 2).
Six skeletons lay on the pit floor (Plates 21 and 22), five placed
in a row down the middle of the pit, parallel to the intrusive burial
mentioned above. The sixth (Skeleton 1), a young adult female,
5 feet in length, lay alongside the northwest edge of the pit. Coppercovered stone ear ornaments (Plate 28, No. 3, 5) lay beside the skull.
Skeleton 2, in the row mentioned above, was that of an adolescent
female, 5 feet 4 inches in length; there were no artifacts with it.
Three teeth were carious. Skeleton 3 was that of a large adult male,
5 feet 7 inches in length, with heavy bones. ]Near the left shoulder
were 15 small points and a long blade of chert (Plate 27, No. 1, 3).

96

Texas Arcb~ological and Paleantologicq.l

Skeleton 4 was that of a young J adult female, 5 feet 8 inches ~in
length, having square ear ornameuts of copper-coated cypress wood
(Plate 28, No. 3, 2). There were no artifacts with either Skeleton 5,
a large male, 6 feet in length, or with Skeleton 6 that of an adolescent, 5 feet in length. All of the skeletal material was in poor condition, and the skulls were badly crushed, which prevented their
being removed for further study.
As noted above, very few artifacts were placed immediately with
the burials. Instead, masses of objects, almost inextricably mixed,
were found on the floor and to a height of 2 feet in the fill along
the northwest pit margin (Plate 21). These facts suggest their
placement as part of a ceremony while the pit was being filled.
Beginning at the western corner of the pit, the first large deposit
contained four groups of small points; sheet copper objects which
included two human effigy faces and hands (Plate 29, No. 2, 1 and
2), several beads, tubes or rolls of copper, and unworked strips;
5 beautiful celts (Plate 27) and two blades; 15 or 16 fragments of
bone pins and an equal number of socketed antler tips; 4 bone and
7 shell ear discs. Nearby was a broken vessel (Plate 26, No. 3, 1)
the separation of several sherds showing that the vessel was broken
when placed with the burials.
A second deposit, situated a few inches farther along the pit margin, included two groups of small points; eight celts, two of which
were spatulate (Plate 27); two discoidals( Plate 26, No. 1); nine
rough stones of varying sizes, one marked from hammering; 13
fragments of broken blades, one reworked into a thin graver; three
blades of chert; a leather covered copper object; three small ear
ornaments; a portion of shell spoon; several masses of unworked
quartz, and a triangular knife of petrified wood. Adjacent to this
deposit was a human effigy pipe (Plate 25). Three small fragments of basketry were found around objects in this deposit, and
here, as in the other deposits, discolored earth suggested decay of
many perishable objects.
Deposit 3 consisted of 11 stone blades and one small cell

foot farther, an intact pottery vessel (Plate 26, No. 3, 3) lay on the
pit floor. The fourth deposit, just beyond, comprised a square
plaque of sheet copper, centrally perforated and embossed (PIate
28, No. 3, 3); five copper-covered wood pendants which have the
shape of animal claws; several other unrecognizable copper forms;
two masses of galena and a group of 10 small shell beads, oval
shaped. A group of small points was found near each corner of this
northwest margin, but with these exceptions, the other margins of
the pit were devoid of objects.
Brtrial Pit 3
A smaller pit, 12 by 11 feet, was found six feet south of Pit 2,
lying under the southwest slope, cut down to the same depth as Pit 2
and similarly filled with a red clay and sand mixture. It is amazing that a pit of this size was dug for the placement of only three
bodies, all near one end (Plate 23, No. 1). Skeleton 1 was that of
a male, 5 feet 11 inches in length, the skull was in excellent condition (Plate 23, No. 2) and the teeth were free of caries. A group
of four small points lay beside the left shoulder, and a fine blade of
semi-translucent flint beside the left femur (Plate 27, No. 1, 2).
Skeleton 2 was of an adult, 5 feet 9 inches in length, with badly
crushed skull, so that sex determination was difficult. The right
tibia and fibula were fractured, with angulation of the lower fragments. Above the left shoulder were six small points and between
the left humerus and the ribs lay a chert blade and fragments of a
small pottery pipe (Plate 26, No. 2, 1). Skeleton 3 of an adolescent,
4 feet 6 inches in length, was lying between the other two, and had
no artifacts with it.
As with Pit 2, most of the artifacts were found along the corresponding northwest margin. In succession we found a rectangular
hone, two celts, a double-stemmed stone pipe, a large mano of sandstone, a broken water bottle (Plate 26, No. 3, 2), a frog effigy pipe
of sandstone and underneath it, a black discoidal (Plate 26, No. 1,
1. For the next two feet, another deposit of closely laid objects
included eight small rubbing stones; 10 chert blades; 10 markedly
serrated arrow points (Plate 28, No. 1, Row 4); several other
smaller points; three celts; five ear ornaments of bone and stone;
a number of small sandstone hones; many fragments of blades, from

which several were reassembled; small flakes of stone; an ungrooved
plummet; 17 bone pins and four beaver incisor teeth (Plate 28, No.
2) ; a bone tool; a square plaque of sheet copper, perforated and
embossed (Plate 28, No. 3, 6) ; two smaller copper-covered ear ornaments of wood; and in one cornpact mass of several layers, a total
of over 300 beads made from marginella shells (Plate 29, No. 1).
At the opposite side of the pit, a large frog effigy pipe (Plate 24),
intact, sat on the floor and leaning on it was a symtnetrical chert
blade, 9~ inches in length (Plate 27, No. 1, 1).
Sum~ o] Fitutings
A.

Skeletal Material.

Eight skeletons were of adults, one adolescent and one child;
where sex ~ould be determined four were males, three females. Tho
stature is comparatively large; skeletons from late Caddo sites in
this area showing usual lengths of 5 feet 6 to 8 inches for males,
5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches for females. Among the eight adults at
Gahagan, one ~neasured 6 feet, two were 5 feet 11 inches, and only
two were less than 5 feet 6 inches.
The e~xcellent dentition, only two evidencing caries, contrasts
again with the late Caddoes of this area, where caries, pyorrhea,
alveolar abscesses and lost teeth were frequent. No evidence of
bone syphilis was seen.
B. Pottery.
Two of the three vessels found by us have similar decorations to
the three described by Moore (1), with bands of fine parallel lines
incised lightly through a glossy black surface, forming concentric
circles and interlocking scrolls on the sides and concentric lines
around the necks of the water bottles. Incised triangles are also
found. The second bowl from Pit 2 (Plate 26, No. 3, 3) differs
from the other five vessels in its construction of irregularly fired,
light gray pottery, flat-bottomed with outflaring sides, and the decoration of parallel, deeply-incised, "overhanging" lines, a characteristic of Coles Creek pottery as described by Ford (3).

103

C. Pipe~.
Exquisite artistry is manifested in the manufacture of the effigy
pipes from this site. We recall t_he human effigy pipe with the
"cloud-blower" feature illustrated by Moore (1). The human effigy
pipe from pit 2 (Plate 25) represents a kneeling human, the right
hand on the knee, the left hand clasped under the knee. The head
is well forward, the features Asiatic, with heavy curving nose. An
oval line atop the head suggests a headdress.
The first frog effigy (Plate 24), a massive pipe weighing 7½
pounds, is one of the finest examples of aboriginal art from this
area. It depicts in lifelike line a male bullfrog seated on a pedestal,
holding a smaller female frog under his chest with the left forepaw.
With the right forepaw he presses deeply into the female’s lower
abdomen, expressing the eggs from the sac. Both this and the human
effigy are made of red pottery, carved or polished after firing.
The second frog effigy is poorly preserved due to absorption of
much of the limestone from which it was made.
Only a few effigy pipes have been found in Louisiana sites. Moore.
(4, 5) illustrated a frog effigy from the Mayes Mound (a Marksville-Coles Creek site) on Larto Lake and two animal effigy pipes
from Sycamore Landing on Bayou Bartholomew. Mr, Neild (6) of
this city has a beautiful human effigy pipe of stone from Peck Village in Catahoula Parish, also a Marksville-Coles Creek site (7).
Jackson (8) described 5 effigy pipes out of a total of 81 pipes from
East Texas, none of them human effigies. It is Ford’s opinion that
the Gahagan effigy pipes are of the type associated with Coles Creek
sites.
The double-stemmed stone pipe (Plate 26, No. 2, 2) is similar to
one illustrated by Thoburn (9) from Oklahoma and attributed by
him to the southern division (Osage or Quapaw) of the Sioux. This
pipe has stems of equal length, whereas the Gahagan pipe has stems
of unequal length, but both are perforated.
The small pottery pipe (Plate 25, No. 2, 1) is of ~e long-stemmed
type found in abundance in Caddo mounds of southern Arkansas,
also in the pre-Caddo burials described by Lemley at the Crenshaw
site (10).

D.

Chipped Stone/lrti]acts.

Thirty-four stone blades were found, varying from 2~/~ to 93~
inches in length (Plate 27, No. 1). They are of two types: squarebased, either symmetrical or curved in knife forms, and made of dull
gray chert; secondly, blades of semi-translucent flint, often with
concave bases and more strongly curved sides.
Arrow points totalling 194 were all of the small or keen type,
varying from one-half to 21,~ inches in length. Flaking was carefully executed and the serrations often exaggerated. Several types
are distinguished (Plate 28) and these often occurred in separate
groups. There were three basal fragments of the triple-notched
white triangular point associated with the Cahokia culture (11).
One shark scale was with a group of points.
E.

Copper.

The southern area is so far from the source of copper that tools
of this material app~r only rarely, as at Moundville. Shetrone
(12) has stated that, in the Gulf area, "the metal was too precious
to bo used for utility purposes and was treasured solely for ornament." Gahagan is the only Louisiana site described to date in
which copper was used to any appreciable extent, even for ornamentation. In the dozens of sites excavated in the state by Moore,
only a few copper beads and copper-covered ear ornaments from
one or two places were mentioned. Thoburn (9) described coppercovered ear plugs from Caddoan sites in Oklahoma, as did Moore
(1) and Harrington (2) in Arkansas.
Of the 29 ear ornaments from Pits 2 and 3 at Gahagan, 15 are
copper-coated and two are made of sheet copper alone. The latter
two are large square plaques (Plate 28, No. 3) of sheet copper, with
concentric circles or squares in repouss6. Three elliptical beads of
wood are each covered with a single sheet of copper. The five
curved pendants of copper-covered wood, found in one group (Plate
29, No. 2, 5), are undoubtedly bear-claw effigies, similar to those of
bone or stone found in some of the Ohio mounds.

Of greatest interest are the copper ceremonial objects, especially
the human effigy masks or faces (Plate 29), each made from two
sheets, one cut to form the oval face, the other to form a long grotesque nose which was inserted through a slit in the face and bradded
with narrow copper strips.

A groove across the forehead with lat-

eral holes allowed for attachment of the mask.
Two copper faces which were identical in appearance and construction to those described above, were found by Moore (13) in
the Grant Mound on St. Johns River, Florida. As tabulated later,
many other similar traits were present.
The two hand effigies of sheet copper, also undoubtedly for ceremonial use, suggest the influence of Moundville, where the hand and
eye concept appeared so often on pottery and ornaments.

F.

Poli,~hed Stone.

Celts constitute the majority of the polished stone artifacts, 19
occurring in the two pits (Plate 27). Some are rough tools, but
many are undoubtedly ceremonial in type, highly finished and unmarred by use. The longest is 14 inches in length, of polished black
slate, flawless in its symmetry and lines. Spatulate celts, such as
the two of greenstone from Pit 2 (Plate 27, No. 3, 1 and 2), do not
appear in any collections or in the reports of any other excavations
from this State, so far as we can.determine. Moorehead (14) illustrates several from Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama, and Florida, the
latter taken from Moore’s report of the St. John’s PAver excavations
(13). The celt illustrated on page 152 of Moorehead’s volume is
almost identical with the notched spatulate from Gahagan. Moore
(16) found in a mound near Chandler Landing on the White River
in Arkansas, a greenstone celt and stone pipes of the double-handled
or "Siouan modified monitor type," which, however, were perforated through only one stem. He called attention to a band of discoloration around the handle of the celt, which he attributed to some
detail of attachment. A similar band appears on all of the long
Gahagan celts.
Other polished stone artifacts include the discoidals (Plate 26,
No. 1). The boatstone found by Moore in Pit 1 increases the pol-

108

Teza~ A~’ch~o~ogi¢~l ~.~.d Pa~eo~tolog~¢o~

ished stone forms from this mound to three -the ceremonial celt,
discoidal, and boatstone.
The list of stone forms is completed by mention of the ear discs,
pulley or spool type, of which nine occur. The largest pair (Plate
28, No. 3, 4) is identical with one of several pairs illustrated by
Thoburn (9), found in a Caddoan earth lodge ruin near Fort Coffee, Oklahoma.
G.

Bone.

There were 20 flat bone pins, 6 to 7~ inches in length, with blunt,
rounded tips and square or bifurcated (fish-tail) bases. Three
have hilt-like carved bases, otherwise no decorations occur.
Seventeen antler tips, one to two inches in length, had sockets in
the base, evidently for use as arrow tips (Plate 28, No. 2, 2). Similar tips are listed by Cole and Deuel in the culture complex of the
Spoon River focus, Mississippi pattern, in Illinois (17).
One blunt tool, four beaver incisors and seven ear ornaments
complete the list of bone artifacts.
H.

Shell.

The shell materials were extremely soft and difficult to preserve.
Appearances of calcium in the soil of the deposits may have represented decayed shell objects. There were seven shell ear ornaments,
the largest an unperforated disc form, 11/~ inches in diameter. Four
have copper bosses on one surface, covering the perforations and
the knot of attaching string (preserved by copper). Ten small
barrel-shaped beads found in one deposit had been carved from the
columella of sea shells (Busycon ?). The most remarkable shell
group is the mass of over 300 beads made from marginella shells
(Plate 29, No. 1). Similar beads, prepared for stringing by grinding a hole in the shoulder, were described by Moore (18) with
Caddo pottery at the Douglas site, on the Arkansas River below Little Rock; also in the Spoon River focus in Illinois by Cole and
Deuel (17).

Three masses of galena, covered with lead oxide, and several
masses of quartz crystal were found. Fabrics are represented by
four small segments of basketry, which show a 3-over 3-under weave.
Little is known of prehistoric basketry in this region, because it is
seldom preserved. A small charred segment, found with late Caddo
pottery in the Belcher mound, north of Shreveport, showed 4-over
1-under weave.
Discussion
The archaeology of the Red River valley in upper Louisiana and
southwestern Arkansas, the historic center of the Caddo confederation, has been associated with the Caddo culture since the early
excavations of Beyer (19) and Moore (1). The Caddo area has
been extended by Moore to include the Ouachita valley (5) ; by Jackson (20) and Pearce (21) to tim Brazos in Texas; by Thoburn (9)
and others into Oklahoma. The typical Caddo culture was rich in
pottery, decorated with the scroll, the circle and semicircle, the sun
design and the spiral--all curved line designs. Decorative elements
include hatched and cross hatched spaces, spurred lines, impression
of pigment into the lines and engraving after firing. Ornaments
included beads, pendants and large carved gorgets, ear and hair
ornaments made of shell and bone. Grooved and ungrooved celts,
small points made from flakes, the square-stemlned blade and the
pitted pecking stono were widely used. Mounds were raised by the
Caddos for both structures and burials, contrary to the opinion expressed by Walker (22) and others that the Caddos did not build
mounds.
Distinct Caddo subcultures are found by Jackson (20) and Goldschrnidt (23) in east Texas and by us in the stratified Belcher mound
in this parish. Moreover, Ford (3) has outlined a pottery chron.
ology for this general area, with the Marksville type of Southern
IIopewell, the widespread Deasonville, and Coles Creek types, all
antedating the historic cultures. Sherd collections in the Red River
valley of Louisiana show all four types of pottery, with Coles Creek
and Caddo predominating.
In Arkansas, Lemley (10) reports a pre-Caddo culture underlying
Caddo at the Crenshaw mound site, the pottery of which Dickinson
(24) shows to have certain similarities to the Coles Creek complex,

and decided similarities with vessels found by Moore along the
northwest coast of Florida.
From certain of these northwest Florida coast mounds (25),
Moore described a recurring group of culture elements, including
sheet copper plaques and ornaments, sheets of mica, shell cups and
beads, masses of galena and quartz crystal, pendants of animal teeth
and tooth effigies. In the Crystal River mound (26) and in a group
of over a dozen mounds on the St. John’s River (27), particularly
the Mt. Royal, Shields and Grant mounds, he found highly developed
copper ornamentation, polished stone celts and problematical forms,
with numerous other traits, as shown in Table I, which are identical
with the findings at Gahagan.

Shetrone (28) first called attention to the similarities between
the Crystal River copper and stone artifacts and those of the Ohio
Hopewell culture.

More recently Greenman (29) ’tabulates many

Hopewellian traits from seventeen of the Florida mounds excavated
by Moore, most of them included in the groups mentioned above.
He not only calls attention to the copper work, the ear ornaments,
the animal tooth and claw e[figies, the sheet mica designs and other
features, but also illustrates pots and sherds with Hopewell shapes
and designs from these Florida mounds.
By analogy with Ford’s (3, 7) accurate stratigraphic studies in
central Louisiana, showing a Marksville (Hopewellian)-Coles Creek
sequence in many sites, one might postulate a Florida Hopewellian
culture succeeded by the Coles Creek-like culture typical of the
northwest Florida coast, retaining some of the Hopewell traits, particularly the ceremonial copper forms.
Whatever the Florida sequences, in the Gahagan mound we find
copper plaques, bear claw effigies in copper-covered wood, coppercovered ear ornaments of "various types, copper tubes, the wrapping
of copper ornaments with fabric, the ceremonial breaking of blades
and celts--all listed by Greenman as Hopewe!lian traits---present
with pottery which is entirely dissimilar to the Hopewdlian vessels
of Florida or to the Marksville variant of Ftopewell in Louisiana.
Instead, we have one bowl whose shape and orna~nentation are characteristically Coles Creek, a second whose shape suggests the northwest Florida vessels with incurring rims and suspension holes; we
have large effigy pipes and other Coles Creek traits listed in Table
II.

ings similar to those at Gahagan. Harrington (2) described, at the
Mineral Springs site in southwestern Arkansas, large deep pits in
which numerous long blades, small points, long-stemmed pottery
pipes and copper ornaments were found. A fragInent of basketry,
attached to a copper-covered parrot’s head of wood, showed the
same 3-over 3-under weave as found at Gahagan. Three pottery
vessels, illustrated as coming from this site, show non-Caddoan influence--incur~ring rims, incised lines paralleling the rims, one
square.bottomed (Coles Creek elements).
Conclusions
We can surmise that at some early date a considerable native
group left their Florida kindred--probably on the St. Johns River-and traveled across to the ~Mississippi, up it and the Red, finally
reaching the Gahagan site.

We cannot say whether this group orig-

inally established the large site, built the mounds and cut burial
pits through this mound at a later date, or took over a previously
established site, cutting the intrusive pits for burials of personages
of importance, as these must have been.

Although retaining many

of their ceremonial objects and customs, sufficient time had elapsed
since they left the Florida group for different pottery and pipe traits
to be either borrowed or developed, .suggesting that these burials
were made during a period of culture transition.

The e:~cellent condition of the teeth, differing from the advanced
caries of the later maize-eating Caddoes and more like the good dentition of the hunting and fishing tribes, would indicate that they
had not yet developed the rather intensive agriculture of the later
Caddoes.
It is hoped that further excavations and study will throw a better
light on the origin of this unique group and its relationships to the
other cultures of this area.

The Chtct~nian Flake Techniqu~ in ~he Western S~ates

129

THE CLACTONIAN FLAKE TECHNIQUE
IN THE WESTERN STATES
BY E. B.

REN/~UD

Flaking was the principal and by far the most general and ancient
method of making stone implements. Pecked and polished artihcts
were rather limited in number and are found only in more advanced
and relatively recent cultures. They were unknown before the Neolithic Age, whereas flaked tools and weapons existed through the
enormously long period of the Old Stone Age, they continued during
the Middle Stone Age and survived side by side with the polished
implements of the New Stone Age and even in the early Metal Ages.
The pressure method came late and was reserved for the finishing
of the finer pieces. But flaking by percussion was the first, and remained to the end the universal method of producing flakes and
shaping ordinary artifacts.
Besides the more elaborate bi-Iace implements, flakes everywhere
were most useful to men of the Stone Age whether they lived during
the glacial epoch of the Old World or in pre-Columbian America.
At first, man, even before being a tool-maker, must have made use
of flakes just as they were found in nature whether produced by the
concussion of pebbles in a river bed, land slides on the slopes of
hills, compression in earth movements, or by any other cause.

Such

ready made flakes could be used as cutting or scraping edges.,
Later, when fashioning his biface implements, man struck off flakes,
which, without retouching, could be utilized for cutting or scraping,
two essential needs of primitive man.

The Acheulean culture was

already well on its way and clearly defined when the so-called
Levallois industry reached Western Europe.

It manufactured flakes

for direct use or to be shaped into artifacts.

The process was com-

plex and specialized and we shall not consider it here since, so far,
nowhere in our Western States in a dozen years of survey have I
found a single flake displaying the characteristic appearance of the
Levalloisian flakes of the Old World.

Much simpler and earlier was the Clactonian technique, which
appeared in Europe in Cbellean times. Without special chipping

130

Texas Archeologlcal a~wl Paleontological Society

preparation a flake was struck off a core.

Its main feature was a

smooth, unfaceted platfor~n, forming a high angle, approxi~nating
120°, with the axis of the flake.

It showed a prominent bulb of

percussion or, better defined, what is technically known as a "semi.
cone." These flakes, of a variety of shapes and sizes, could be
utilized the same as the others for scraping and cutting, or in the
making of tools. This simple method continued through the Early
Palaeolithic, or first phase of the Old Stone Age, paralleling the
development of the typical Chelleo-Acheulean biface artifacts. It
even survived later, being one of the constituting factors recognizable
in many Mousterian tools, side-scrapers and points, whereas others
followed the Levallois tradition.
Several years ago I recognized the Clactonian technique in the
Black’s Fork Culture of Southwestern Wyoming. But it was only
in the Spring of 1938 that, picking up some chips at a site in New
Mexico, I noticed with astonishment their general appearance of
Clactonian flakes. During the Summer of the same year many
more flakes and artifacts were collected at Pueblo sites of the upper
Rio Grande Basin. During the Winter my assistants went through
our ver~ extensive collection of stone artifacts collected over the
High Western Plains in the past twelve years and sorted out all
flakes of Clactonian appearance. I personally examined and measured the angle of all the specimens used for statistical purpose in
order to insure the same technique. This is the first time that such
an investigation has been conducted for so extensive a territory and
representing three distinct cultures.
Our survey comprises 2,179 flakes from 493 sites of the Camp
Culture of the High Western Plains, of which 685 specimens come
from 126 sites in Eastern Wyoming, 1,078 pieces from 273 sites in
Eastern and Southern Colorado, and 416 flakes from 94 sites in
Northeastern New Mexico. To this were added 441 specimens of
the Basket Maker.Pueblo Cultures coming from 39 sites mostly in
Northcentral New Mexico, three cave sites in Western Oklahoma,
and two locations from Southwestern Colorado; also 551 flakes and
artifacts from 53 sites of the Black’s Fork Culture of Southwestern
Wyoming, principally from river terraces. Our sample is quite
large, it is varied as to origin and culture, it has been collected by

The Cla~oni~n Fl~ake Technique in $he W~stern States

131

myself and several different assistants in the course of many years
and before the thought of making a survey of Clactonian flakes came
to our mind. It should, therefore, be considered as a satisfactory
sample allowing significant conclusions. These were formulated
after plotting the graphs of distribution of the m~gles of all the
flakes for each one of the five series above mentioned.
First, the range of fluctuations of the angles for the 3,171 specimens from 590 sites, plotted for each group, is from 100 and 133
degrees, with a few cases of 135 and 136 degrees, that is to say
essentially the same range for the three states.
The lower limit of 100 degrees is due to the fact that flakes with
a smaller angle were not measured since we knew that they could
not qualify. Besides, these were very few and, with one exception,
our graph begins with only three to six pieces with an angle of 100
degrees, so that we really are very near the actual lower end of the
CUll’e,

The maximum angle com~non to all groups is 133 degrees, with
a very low frequency. Only a few flakes measure 135 or 136 degrees
and must be considered aberrant. This might even be said for angles
above 130 degrees on account of their scarcity.
The maximum ]requency for the High Western Plains is 110 degrees. It is also a high point, but not the true maximum, for Sohthwestern Wyoming, and the nearest, 109 degrees, is well represented
for the Pueblo culture, next to its maximum. An angle of 110 degrees
may, therefore, be considered as relatively characteristic of the
re, on.

The angle of the true Clactonian ]lakes of the Old World approximates 120 degrees. Allowing a margin of five degrees we may
establish a division comprising all flakes showing an angle inferior
to 115 degrees, and another for those displaying a wider angle.
The first class will naturally be called "Sub-Clactonian" and the
second group "Clactonian.like." This would mean that the specimens’considered here have been produced by the Clactonian technique, but those of the latter type are more closely similar to the
true Clactonian flakes of Europe and Africa. They are the American counterpart of these Early Palaeolithic flakes of the Old World.

132

Texas Archeological and Paleon$ologi~al So~i¢~y

The question of age or relative antiquity is not implied nor even
suggested here, only the resemblance of technique of their manufacture by the Western Indians, prehistoric or more recent.
Let us now consider the distribution of angles for the High Igestern Plains. The lowest percentage of Clactonian-like flakes was
found on the sites of eastern and southern Colorado, only 32.46 per
cent of a total of 1,078 specimens. Next we see Eastern Wyoming
and Northeastern New Mexico giving an identical proportion of
Clactonian-like flakes, 37.08 per cent and 37.01 per cent respectively
out of 685 specimens from the northern state and 416 from the
southern state. Together, tben, out of 2,179 flakes from the High
Western Plains, 758 or 34.78 per cent are truly Clactonian-like, that
is to say slightly over one-third of the total, whereas 65.21 per cent
are only sub.Clactonian because their angles are inferior to 115
degrees, for the rest the technique being similar.
We may now compare the Camp Culture with the Pueblo Culture
of New Mexico. Out of 441 specimens from 44 sites, 46.93 per cent
qualify as Clactonian-like, that is to say 9.92 per cent higher than
for the camp sites of Northeastern New Mexico, to the east of the
Pueblo region, or 12.15 per cent superior to the general average for
the High Western Plains. In view of the similarity of the percentages over that vast territory, it may well be that the difference,
marked by a greater proportion of Clactonian-like flakes of Pueblo
mantifacture, is due to a cultural reason. That is to say that this
would be the result of a difference in culture, since the Indians of
the Western Plains were nomadic~ hunters until a couple of generations ago whereas the Pueblos have been sedentary agriculturists for
over a millenium.
The sites of the Black’s Fork Culture of Southwestern Wyoming
have furnished .56.80 per cent of their 551 specimens as Clactonianlike flakes. This is the maximum proportion for the five geographic
districts compared here and the only one with a greater ratio of
Clactonian-like flakes than of sub-Clactonian, as is the case everywhere else. It is almost 10 per cent higher than for the Pueblo

PLATE 30.

Plate 30

Th~ Cla,c$onian Flak~ Techniqu~ in ~he Western S~ates

135

sites, nearly 20 per cent above the percentage of Eastern Wyoming
and Northeastern New Mexico, and it exceeds Eastern Colorado by
24.34 per cent.

This seems due to a difference in culture for the

examination of the lithic industry of the Black’s Fork region shows
it to be palaeolithie-like in typology and technique. Here the Clactonian flakes come with coup-de-poing-like biface artifacts, the same
as in Western Europe. On the other hand the Clactonian-like and
sub-Clactonian flakes of the Camp Cultures of the Plains are associated with implements and weapons of obviously more recent types
and times. We may, therefore, accept tentatively that the marked
difference in percentage of Clactonian flakes found on the sites of
the Camp Culture of the High Western Plains, the Pueblo sites, and
those of the terraces of the Black’s Fork Creek of Southwestern
Wyoming is affected by a cultural difference. Further investigation
in that line would be necessary to prove this point more conclusively.
There is another aspect to the question of percentage of the Clactonian-like flakes: it is that of the material of which the specimens
are made. All through the area surveyed, the two kinds of stone
most frequently used and employed by the five groups examined are
quartzite and chert. These two terms are taken here in their generic
rneaning without any attempt at more specific distinctions such as
an expert petrologist could make. Other stones were sometimes
fairly abundant but only in one group or another. For instance,
moss-agate and obsidian were used for Pueblo flakes, petrified wood
is found in Eastern Colorado, chalcedony and jasper in Eastern
Wyoming. Keeping only quartzite and chert for comparison, we
have the following percentages for Clactonian-like flakes made of
quartzite: Eastern Colorado, 34.56; Northeastern New Mexico,
37.43; Eastern Wyoming, 42.95; Pueblo sites 43.24 and Southwest
Wyoming 63.34. Here again we have the same grouping, although
the three camp culture districts are not quite as close together as
before. The Pueblo flakes of Clactonian-like type are still proportionately more numerous than those of the Plains, but by a narrower
margin. The Black’s Fork Culture remains in the lead and is 20
per cent ahead of the Pueblo culture.
Let us now consider chert for percentages of Clactonian-like
flakes: Eastern Colorado, 29.62; Eastern Wyoming, 31.79; North-

136

Texa~ Archeological ~nd Paleon$ologica~ Society

eastern New Mexico, 35.55, less than 6 per cent difference between
the three states, whereas there was 8 per cent for quartzite, which is
not very significant.

The only change is the fact that Southwestern

Wyoming with 47.42 per cent is a little inferior to the Pueblo group
with 49 per cent.

The Black’s Fork Culture is nearly 16 per cent

above the camp sites of Eastern Wyoming, but for the first time
lower than one of the districts.
If we now compare quartzite and chert in the same order for the
same territorial divisions we see: Eastern Colorado: 34.56 per cent
and 29.62 per cent; Northeastern New Mexico: 37.43 per cent and
35.55 per cent; Eastern. Wyoming 42.95 per cent and 31.79 per cent.
In the three cases the proportion of Clactonian-like flakes ~nade of~
quartzite was superior to that of chert, from 2 to 11 per cent. The
Black’s Fork Culture with 63.34 per cent and 47.4.2 per cent shows
nearly 16 per cent in favor of quartzite. The specimens from the
Pueblo sites constitute the exception with 43.24 and 49 per cent, the
only case showing more Clactonian flakes made of chert than of
quartzite for the same region and culture. However, it must not be
forgotten that the Pueblo culture represents here only ~14 sites against
546 of the other groups, and 4.~1 flakes against 2,730 specimens
from elsewhere. This divergence may not outweigh the cvidence
furnished by the rest of the field. Otherwi~, in four groups out of
five, quartzite has a superiority in high angle flakes. It may be a
sufficient basis for recognizing tentatively an influence of the material on the production of Clactonian-like flakes.
A few words for the other materials will suffice. In Eastern Colorado petrified wood was extensively used in some districts. Out of
163 specimens measured only 45 or 27.60 per cent gave Clactonianlike flakes, or 2 per cent less than chert for the same state. Moss.
agate from Pueblo sites produced a much better percentage, 51.92,
or nearly 2 per cent above chert for the same culture, and even much
higher than chert for all groups considered, and quartzite also,
except from Southwestern Wyoming. Obsidian, naturally found in
a country of old volcanic activity such as the Rio Grande basin, and
utilized because producing sharp edges, gave the very high ratio of
59.45 per cent of Clactonian-like flakes of Pueblo make. This is

The Clactonian Flak~ Techniqu~ i~ the Western St~.~

137

superior to all percentages for that class, except again that of quartzite of the Black’s Fork Culture of Southwestern Wyoming with
63.34.

However, it must be remembered

that the figures for

moss-agate and obsidian are based on a small sampling, respectively
52 and 37 flakes, and therefore, it may not be entirely dependable
and accurately comparable to quartzite and chert which are very
much more abundant.

As for chalcedony and jasper represented

by only a few flakes in each group, and rhyolite from Southern
Colorado, these materials are too rare in our collection to allow a
significant percentage.
¯ In conclusion it may be said that this is the first time that the
Clactonian technique is proved to exist extensively in America.

It

had already been stated in two of my reports on the Black’s Fork
Culture of Southwestern Wyoming, but it had never been studied in
detail nor extended to the Camp Culture of the High Western Plains
and the Pueblo sites of New Mexico.
This being entirely pioneer work it will explain why the two following conclusions, although based on specific results, are given as
only tentative and subject to further considerations: 1. There seems
to be a cultural element (using the term in its broadest sense) indicated in the ratio of "sub-Clactonian" and "Clactonian-like" flakes,
when the five series considered here are compared. The close approximation of the percentages for Eastern Wyoming, Colorado and
New Mexico is one more proof of their being local parts of the stone
Camp Culture. The differences noted in the proportions of Clactonian-like flakes of Pueblo make and those from the Black’s Fork
culture of Southwestern Wyoming between themselves and in regard
to the High Western Plains, clearly suggests a cultural factor at
least partly responsible for such variation. 2. It also seems that the
material used in the manufacture of the flakes may be another factor
influencing the relative proportion of low and high angle flakes
for the various districts or groups compared here. Quartzite, almost
everywhere produces more flakes with a relatively larger angle
than chert.
It would seem desirable to have this first systematic study of the

138

T¢~o~ Archeolog~al a~w~ Pa~eo~ologlcal So~y

Clactonian technique in the production of flakes extended to other
parts of America and to a variety of Indian cultures.

It might

furnish interesting facts concerning the making of flaked stone
implements in the New World.

EVIDENCES OF THE MARKSVILLE AND
COLES CREEK COMPLEXES AT THE
KIRKHAM PLACE, CLARK
COUNTY, ARKANSAS
BY S. D. DICKINSON AND HARRY J. LEMLEY

The archaeology of southern Arkansas is no longer a two dimensional study. Although sufficient stratigraphic evidence is still
lacking for a complete understanding of the relationships of the
prehistoric ceramic complexes with their affiliated cultures, enough
data have been obtained for the establishment of a tenable chronologic system, which is consistent not only within Arkansas itself but
also with what has been observed in Louisiana and Mississippi.
The discovery of the pre-Caddo pottery at the Crenshaw Site in
Southwest Arkansas1 and the demonstration of its relationship to
the Coles Creek complex of Louisiana and Mississippi:’ afforded
both a confirmation of previous investigations done in those states
and a basis for future researches in the sequence of Arkansas’ prehistoric cultures. The presence of Deasonville ware with lesser quantities of Marksville and Coles Creek along Bayou Macon in Southeast Arkansasz aided still further in correlating the archaeological
remains of this state with ceramic sequences established to the eastward and southward through the efforts of Ford, Setzler, Collins
and Chambers.
Logically, the next point of attack was the Ouachita River Valley,
lying between Red River and Bayou Macon. In order to ascertain
the possible presence of pre-Caddo horizons in this intervening area,
the writers in the fall of 1938, began an investigation of a mound
near the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Ouachita, where
the senior author had previously found crude sherds which it was
thought belonged to the Coles Creek complex. These sherds had

occurred in a midden several feet below the remains of a wattle and
daub lodge in which a broken Caddoan vessel had been found.~
The purpose of this paper is to present the data obtained in this
investigation.
The site in question is located in Section 21, Township 9 South,
Range 22 West, Clark County, Arkansas, upon what is known locally
as the Kirkham Place. The present owner is Mr. J. Bert Wingfield,
of Okolona, Arkansas, who kindly consented to our excavation.
The Little Missouri River, the present bed of which is approximately one mile west of the site, heads in the Ouachita Mountains
in western Arkansas and flows in a southeasterly direction across the
Athens Plateau and the upper extremity of the Gulf Coastal Plain
before emptying into the Ouachita. After leaving the highlands
about 20 miles above the Kirkham Place, the river meanders through
an extensive flood plain that is bounded on the northeast by a low
ridge of badly eroded hills in which Upper Cretaceous strata of
limestone, chalk and marl are exposed. The valley, cut by the
present and numerous former channels of the Little Missouri, is very
fertile because of the alluvial deposits that it receives. In prehistoric times it must have been capable of supporting a comparatively dense sedentary population. This is evidenced by the large
number of mounds and camp sites in the locality.
Considerable debris of animal bones, mussel shells and stone
rejects litter the Kirkham Site. The chief feature of archaeological
interest, however, is the mound, consisting of a basal midden of black
soil on top of which a lighter colored earth had been added to form
the foundation for the aforementioned wattle and daub house. This
mound, which is situated in a bend of a former channel of the river,
is roughly elliptical, easterly and westerly. It is approximately 85
yards long and 50 yards broad at the widest point, and has a maximum height of about 12 feet. Both the present shape and dimen4. Dickinson, S. D., "Ceramic Relationshiva of the Pre-Caddo Potter,/ from the

sions, however, have little significance, as a former owner of the
property reports that some years ago he removed seven feet of earth
from the top of the mound and distributed the same on its slopes.
Moreover, both the mound and surrounding field have been in cultivation for at least twenty-five years.

Disturbed Caddo burials were discovered by us on the northern
side of the mound but our investigation was concentrated on the
west end where plowing had exposed sherds belonging to the Marksville and Coles Creek complexes. Under our supervision, a crew of
men spent 152 working hours in excavating an area which had been
staked for a space of fifteen feet inward from the western extremity
of the mound. In each staked section the digging was carried down
to the base of the midden above referred to. Thus, the excavation,
which at the outer extremity was only a few inches deep, was continued inward until a maximum midden depth of 1/~ feet was
attained. As no evidence of the Caddo was found in this midden
area, a trench was extended farther inward in order that that part
of the midden directly below the Caddo superstructure could be
examined.

No evidences of vertical stratigraphy were apparent in the midden. However, Coles Creek sherds predominated at the outer extremity of the excavation, and decreased somewhat as the digging
was continued inward. As our work was confined to the slope and
we did not reach the center of the mound, it is possible that well
defined ceramic sequences may be determind in the future investiga.
tion which we expect to make at this site.
Large quantifies of mussel shells, some land snail shells, deer,
bear and bird bones abounded throughout the midden area excavated. Although mussel shells are frequently found in middens in
Arkansas, we have never before observed such an abundance as we
noted here. Incidentally, this species of pelecypoda thrives in the
neighboring stream, which in recent times has supported a minor
pearl fishing industry.
The only human remains found in the midden were a fragment
of the frontal bone of a skull and a part of a lower mandible. They
both belonged to an adult, but were found at different depths and
in different cuts.

In order to establish more conclusively through typological means
the relationship between the Kirkham Site and others which have
yielded evidence of the Marksville and Coles Creek complexes, the
collections gathered here by us are discussed according to the division of primitive industry to which they specifically belong.
Projectile Points

Large projectile points were found at all levels in the midden
down to tim base, a total of 47. Of these 41 are of the lozenge
shaped type, or slight variants therefrom (Plate 31, d, n, o, p, q, r,
s, t, u). Harrington5 described this type "as having the form of
two acute triangles, one of them truncated, placed base to base."
In the case of the variants, frequently the stem, which is slightly
constricted where it joins the blade, flares at the base; in several
cases, the specimens have barbs (Plate 31, e). The remaining points
from the midden consist of one with a single shoulder, or wing
(Plate 31, m), one with a slightly concave base (Plate 31, h), and
three deeply notched. The length of the points is from 3.6 cm. to
8 cm. No small points were found in the midden.
A surface collection of 80 large projectile points and three small
ones (Plate 31, j), was obtained on the site. This is directly contrasted by the finds both in graves and on the surface at the Crenshaw Place, where numerous small points have been found but
only one large arrowhead has been observed, and it from the surface. Seventy of the specimens from the surface are of Harrington’s lozenge shaped type (supra). One is also serrated. A triangular point is included in the surface collection. This form,
rare in the Red and Little Missouri areas, is plentifully distributed
in smaller specimens along the Mississippi and St. Francis Rivers
in Northeast Arkansas, and occurs in the larger point in the vicinity
of Hot Springs, as Harringtons has reported. Harrington also
illustrates large projectile points with concave bases taken by him
from the deep deposits at Site I, Hot Springs.7
The absence of small points in the midden seems significant.

Harrington has observed that they predoxninatc in Caddo graves,
although large ones are sometimes present, and that both types occur
on the surfaces. It has been suggested that the Caddo people may
have picked up the larger points which had been used by their predecessors and placed them in their graves as talismen. This theory,
however, leaves unexplained the fact that large points are frequently found in numbers on the surface of sites showing sherds
of the Caddo, but none of the Pre-Caddo complexes. It is possible
that some of the large points found in this area may have been used
by a non-ceramic group. Harrington found the large lozenge or
diamond shaped form in the lower layers of the Ozark Bluff shelters of Northwest Arkansas.9 Further research may throw additional light on the problem. A related form of projectile point is
represented in collections from Marksvillelo and also from the
Troyville Mounds.l 1
The great majority of the points obtained both in the excavation
and on the surface were made of novaculite, the remainder of chert.
Both materials occur in nodular form in gravel bars along the
neighboring river. However, the aboriginal quarries of novaculite
around Hot Springs may have been the source of some of this stone.
Other Chipped/trtl/acts
Two types of knives were foun~l in the midden: triangular (Plate
31, a, b, e), and oval or leabshaped (Plate 31, c); length 4.5 cm.
to 11 cm.; likewise a few scrapers made from flakes (Plate 31, k) ;
also a crude pointed implement, triangular in cross section (Plate
31, i) ; one broken T-shaped drill was found on the surface.
It has been impossible to classify two unusual shaped objects of
black chert illustrated in Plate 31, f and g; "f’" came from the
midden and "g" from the surface. A similar specimen is illustrated
by Harrington.I ~

One celt (Plate 32, g) and two fragments of others were discovered in the ~nidden.

Green stone, probably quartzite, was the

material utilized.

The perfect specimen is 10.5 cm. long with a

blade 6 cm. wide.

This celt is somewhat different from those taken

from Caddo graves in Clark County, which are usually longer in
proportion to the width of the blade. It is of the rounded type, as
described by Harrington.13 Celts reminiscent of this one have
been found at the Troyville Mounds, Louisiana,in at the Renner
Site, Mi~ouri15 and also at the Turner Group, Ohio.16 At the
last mentioned place but few celts and no grooved axes were
found. 17
Careful examination of both surface and midden material failed
to yield any evidence of the use of grooved axes. Their absence
is paralleled at the Crenshaw Place and at sites in the Bayou Macon
area of Arkansas. In this connection, it is interesting to note that
grooved axes have not been reported from Marksville. According
to Shetrone they are not associated with the Hopewell culture.~8
Wedel, however, reports them from the Missouri Hopewellian
site. 19
A portion of a chipped double bitted and notched axe was found
in the midden. This specimen is of black quartzite. Such axes occur
throughout Southwest Arkansas and are also found in Oklahoma,

Stone Vessel
In cut 5, section 2, a fragment of the wall of a pecked but unpolished limestone bowl (Plate 32, c) was found. The vessel apparently had walls less curved than the semi-spherical stone bowls
Shetrone illustrates from the Hopewell earthworks.22 The prehistoric peoples of this area rarely used stone vessels. Harrington,
however, figures a broken limestone bowl from Ozan, ~empstead
County, Arkansas,23 and several years ago a complete steatite vessel was plowed up on the J..S. Briggs Place, on Black Bois d’Arc
Creek, about nine miles south of Ozan. Steatite was used in the
manufacture of bowls in the Bayou Macon district near Floyd,
Louisiana. Moore found several fragments of soapstone pots at
Poverty Point,2~ and a number of others to our knowledge have
l~en obtained from that site.
Problematical and Ornamen~d Stone ,4rti/act~
The midden refuse explored by us contained a broken gorget and
fragments of two boatstones. The gorget (Plate 32, d), triangular
in shape, is of slate and has a perforation which had been drilled
from both sides. It is 7 cm. by 4.8 cm. This is not an unusual
form for Arkansas.

(Plate 32, b) is of breccia. The latter is too fragmentary for de[inite determination as to shape but its hollow base and polished
convex surface suggest Patterson’s Variety IX.z5 The former apparently belongs to Variety XXVIII.26 It is 6.5 cm. high, and has
a cavity 1 cm. deep. The walls are rather thick and the sides
slightly convex." The keel is 5 mm. in width.
A boatstone (Plate 32, f) of this same variety was found on the
surface of this midden, in 1906. It is also illustrated by Patterson.27 Its base is 8 cm. long and 3 cm. wide; the sides are convex,
and the keel is 6 ram. in width. It is 3.8 cm. high and is of brown,
bedded quartzitic sandstone.
In 1932, a boatstone of Patterson’s Variety XXVI120 was dis.
covered while a shallow trench was being dug in the northwestern
slope of the midden (Plate 32, e). This specimen is unusually well
made and has a deep basal cavity. The walls are thin, and am
polished on both exterior and interior. The base is 9.2 cm. long with
a maximum width of 3 cm. The keel is 1.2 cm. wide. The stone
is 4.3 cm. high, and appears to have been made of quartzite.
Boatstones have been reported from Marksville,29 trom Coles
Creek Burials at the Crenshaw Place,30 and from the surface of a
Deasonville-Marksville-Coles Creek site in the Arkansas Bayou Macon area,31 but [he number found at the Kirkham site is surprising
when the general rarity of this type of artifact is considered.

Bone mrd Horn Implements
In the midden also were four socketed projectile points of deer
antler; 10 antler tines; one deer ulna (Plate 33, k), presumably
used in flaking; one cylinder of antler; and seven bone awls. The
projectile points (Plate 33, i, 1), the first to he reported from
Southwest Arkansas, are similar to specimens from Marksville,32
but differ somewhat from those obtained at the Renner Site, which
have a single basal tang.33 However, two of the antler fines (Plate
33, b) do have the single triangular basal tang, which the tines from
the Missouri Hopewellian site lack.3’~ The cylinder (Plate 33, e)
is also comparable to one illustrated by Wedel.35 One end of the
specimen has been rounded slightly and polished. It was found at
a depth of 3 feet in Gut 7, Section 2. The awls (Plate 33, c, d, f, g,
m), which range in length from 4 to 13 cm., occurred at depths of
from 2 to 4 feet.
Shell /lrti]act
When the abundance of shells in the refuse is considered, it is surprising that no artifacts of shell were found. However, a perforated
shell ornament (Plate 33, h), made from the whorl of a large marine
shell, was found on the surface of this midden by one of the writers
in 1923.
P~pe$

Fragments of platform pipgs of clay with large stems, made of
brown paste were found both on the surface and within the midden
(Plate 34, e, t, g). These differ somewhat from those from Marksville by having a rounded instead of an elliptical base. In that t~:cy
are rounded, they are similar to the long stemmed pipes found by
Harrington36 and Moore~7 in tim Red River Valley and also to
those discovered both in the Caddo and Pre-Caddo burials at the
Crenshaw Place.38

Pottery
Large numbers of sherds were obtained from the midden. All
were from pots and bowls and none from bottles, as was the case in
the Pre-Caddo levels on the Crenshaw Place. Beakers, jars and
bowls were represented. We have segregated for intensive study
those sherds possessing special significance such as rims, bases and
decorations. As the decorative motives have previously been used
as the prime distinguishing features of the Marksville and Coles
Creek ceramic complexes, we further divided the significant sherds
into two groups, consisting of the plain and decorated ones, which
are discussed under their respective headings:
UNDECORATED

WARE

Rims
No attempt has been made to distinguish between the Marksville
and Coles Creek wares represented by 197 plain rim sherds, for they
form, as a whole, a rather homogeneous group. The sherds vary
from 4 ram. to 1 cm. in thickness. The color of the paste ranges
from black, brown, and gray to buff and red. This last color is
probably a local variation due to environmental resources, for red
pastes, with one exception, were not noted in the Pre-Caddo ware
from the Crenshaw Site and they have not been reported from the
Marksville and Coles Creek sites in Louisiana and Mississippi.
Slips are rarely present. Two sherds with red washes were found
on the surface of the midden, but they could be Caddoan. Reference
is made elsewhere in this paper to the intentional application of a
red slip to decorated ware.
In order that the temper could be determined 26 undecorated
sherds were sent to the Ceramic Repository for the Eastern United
States, where Frederick R. Matson, Jr., kindly examined them. According to Matson, 23 of the specimens contained appreciable quantifies of white temper, but the others had little aplastic. Three
sherds, typical of the group of 23, were selected for microscopic
examination. Of them, Matson reports:.

"The white aplastic is tuff or volcanic glass. In many fragments
the bubbles are elongated and the flow structure is apparent. Some
pieces are slightly devitrified, particularly the bubble areas. The
tuff is pale brown in color when viewed in transmitted light."
"The tuff varies in size from minute particles to pieces 3 ram. in
length. Few fragments are less than 0.05 mm. long."
"Quartz; clear and angular, is the dominant ~nineral in the thin
sections. It has a maximum length of 0.15 ram., with an average
length of about 0.11 ram. This indicates that the clay is sandy in
texture, but due to the fineness of the quartz particles, the clay might
not feel very gritty when it was worked. Due to the large amount
of quartz present, it hardly seems likely that it was necessary to
add the tuff to the paste as an aplastic to reduce drying shrinkage
or make the clay less sticky when it was worked. It would seem
probable that the tuff was added for some traditionaI reason."
Tuff occurs at the diamond mines near Murfreesboro, Pike Co.,
Arkansas, which is approximately 35 miles north of the Kirkham
Site. The Little Missouri River flows by these volcanic deposits,
consequently there is the possibility that the tuff had been transported downstream and was deposited on river bars where the
potters might have found it.
A microscopic study was also made of one of the sherds which
did not contain tuff. l:t had quartz, which seemed to be native to
the clay. The same clay appeared to have been used in both groups
of sherds, although it varied in texture. In the case of the sandy
clay no aplastic was needed. Tuff, however, was added to the finer
grained kaolin.39
There are no indications that the pottery was manufactured by
other than the coiled process. Traces of the clay ropes can still be
seen on the inner walls of some sherds where the smoothing was
incomplete. In one instance, a sherd, which had broken along the
lines of the original coil, shows the width of the rope. It is 9 mm.
thick and 1.2 cm. high. The bottom of the old coil is concave
while the top is flat.

Most of the sherds have been more carefully smoothed on the
exterior than on the inner wall. Comparatively few, however, have
any indications of the polish that is present on some of the decorated specimens. Generally, the ware is compact, but can be
scratched with the finger nail. Eight sherds were perforated. In
each instance the holes were drilled after the vessel had been fired.
At a depth of one foot in Cut 6, Section 2, we discovered a sherd
of a small, flat bottomed bowl, the dimensions and curvature of
which enabled us to complete the vessel for~n in plaster. The bowl,
as reconstructed, is 8 cm. high and has a basal diameter of 6 cm.
and an oral one of 13.5 cm. (Fig. b, Plate 35). (These dimensions,
which are based on the extension of the sherd curvatures, are open
to question). The paste is gray in color, and the rim, which has a
rounded lip, slopes outward slightly. Two centimeters below the
rim there is a horizontal groove, semi-circular in cross section and
approximately" 2 cm. wide, that encircles the vessel. It is paralleled
on the interior wall of the bowl by a corresponding convex ridge.
This groove is reminiscent of a somewhat similar one below the rim
of a jar from Marksville,’~O and also of the plain, constricted necks
of three vessels from the Renner site.’~I
We have classified the rim sherds as follows:
Rims with incurved walls: (Plate 36, a, b, c). These evidently
belonged to bowls. Ninety-seven of tho seventy-seven that comprise
this group have rounded lips; the remaining twenty are flattened.
In some instances the lips have ragged edges which extend beyond
the rim walls as if the potter, while smoothing the rim, had pressed
the clay, causing it to spread. These projections usually are from
1 to 2 mm_ wide. Six of the rounded rims have an inward projection of the lip and eight have an exterior one; three of the flat rims
possess the exterior extension and one, the inner projection.
Rims having a straight ext~rlor wall: (Plate 36, d, e, f, g, h).

Many of these sherds also have a straight inner wall while there
are others which have slightly curving ones. In the latter group the
sherd wall attains its greatest thickness at the point of inflection,
from which it then decreases before terminating with the round or
flat lip. Although Ford has described a Coles Creek rim type which
has this same profile, we hesitate to place these sherds in a classification separate from those which have both straight outer and inner
wails, because the curvature of the sherds that we have studied is
extremely slight, and we have had no specimens from Louisiana with
which to compare them. Furthermore, the inflection generally
occurs about 2 cm. below the rim lip of the Kirkham sherds, while
those discussed by Ford are thickest approximately I inch from the
lip.’~2 This type, as described in Ford’s ,4nalysis o/Indian Village
Site Collections /rom Louisiana and Mississippi, also has flat but
not rounded lips, and no reference is made to the presence of lip
projections such as so~netimes occur on both rounded and flat rims
from the Kirkham midden. Our collection of rims with straight
exterior walls includes fifty-three with rounde& lips and forty-seven
with flat ones. Of the former group, six have exterior projections
and three have interior extensions. Three of the flat lips possess
the interior projections and ten have the exterior projections, while
two lips are slightly extended over both the inner and exterior walls
of the sherds. These rims probably belonged to beakers and jars.
The size of the sherds indicates both large and small vessels. One
large sherd appears to be quite similar to two from Mound 4 at
Marksville.’~3
Flared rims: Twelve of the twenty discovered had flat lips (Plate
36, i), the remaining eight were rounded (Plate 36, j). One of the
latter has an external projection while three of the former group
have exterior extensions, and one has an inner projection. These
rims belonged to bowls and jars. Some of the rims broke at the
point of juncture with the body. The height of the rims from this
juncture to the lip varies from 1 to 5.8 cm. One rim (Plate 36, k)
especially merits attention because of its compound flare which is
more pronounced on the interior than on the exterior wall.

Thickened rims: Only two of this type were discovered.

One was

a common Coles Creek rim (Plate 36, L) which had been thickened
by the addition of a strap of clay to the exterior walt. Its lip was
rounded.

The other specimen (Plate 36, m) is unique in the col-

lection from the midden and unlike any figured by Ford. The incurving rim narrows 8 rnm. below the flattened top. From this
constriction the outer wall rises to form a right angle with the lip,
while the interior wall curves even farther inward and upward to
meet the lip.
Vessel Bases

As square and round bases are common both to Marksville and
Coles Creek wares they are treated here as a unit. Of 184, found
in the midden, 137 were round and 47 were square. Four of the
latter had rudimentary feet while 40 of the round ones had basal
constrictions. Although reference has been madein various publications to the rudimentary feet of certain Marksville and Coles Creek
vessels, basal constrictions have not been reported, insofar as the
writers have observed. This constriction seems to have been formed
by first coiling the base and then beginning the body walls within
rather than on top of the outermost coil of the vessel bottom. Occasionally this outside coil is thicker than the remaining part of the
base, thereby forming a sort of rudimentary pedestal. The majority
of the round bases, however, are flat on the lower side and slightly
concave on the upper. Only two have a convex upper surface.
The round and square bases vary in thickness frown 8 ram. to 2.5 cm.
Although we are at this point concerned with the undecorated
ware, we do not deem it inappropriate to refer to the extremely elementary decorations on three round bases. One of these has a single
curving incised line on its lower surface (Plate 34, b), another has
two parallel curving lines on the lower side, while the third has a
line incised on both lower and upper surfaces (Plate 34, a).

one would expect, constitute the minor but more significant group.
In order to establish more clearly the relationship between the pottery of the Kirkham midden and that of other lower Mississippi
sites that have yielded Marksville and Coles Creek wares, we have
deemed it advisable to utilize the same typology that Ford has devised for his classification of the decorations of these ceramic complexes,’~’~ and in this connection are using his numerical formulas
followed by type names which he informs us he is using in connection with a revision of his typology into broader ceramic groups.’~5
Marksville Complex
Type

31;23;2
(Marker type)u"Churupa Punctated." These
73
sherds have broad, curving bands filled with punctations and are
separated from plain smoothed ones by wide, deeply incised lines.
The punctations were made either with a hollow reed held at an
angle of fifteen or twenty degrees or else with a pointed tool which
was gouged slightly into the clay, creating an elliptical incision. In
instances where a hollow instrument was used, tiny clay projections
remain in the deep end of the punetation.
At depths from 1½ to 2 feet in Cut 4, Section 2, a number of
decorated sherds of this type were discovered. They all apparently
belonged to the same vessel as the traits of manufacture and decoration were similar. Furthermore, it was possible to cement some of
the sherds together in order to form three larger pieces (Plate 37,
b, d, e). It was, however, impossible to reconstruct the jar. The
vessel walls sloped outward and upward to a shoulder where they
curved inward and up to form a straight rim with rounded lip. The
rim was not thickened as were some of the specimens of this type
collected by Ford.’~ts The paste is brown. The interior wall has
been blackened by contact with fire, whereas the exterior wall ranges
in color from burnt sienna to deep umber. The punctated bands are
arranged across the body of the vessel and meet the rim at certain
points. Unfortunately, no portion of the base of the jar was dis44. Ford, $. A., "Anslysis of Indian Village Site Collections from Louisiana and

covered so it is impossible to determine if it was decorated also, as
some of the vessels of this type described by Ford were.z~7 One of
the punctated bands (Plate 37, d), begins at the rim lip and extends
downward to the vessel shoulder where it curves back and terminates before reaching the rim again. This is rather reminiscent of
a roughened hook-shaped figure which occurs on a bowl excavated
by Squier and Davis in a Hopewell mound in Ohio.~8 The design
on the latter specimen, however, is suspended from a horizontal band
just below a row of punctations that encircle the vessel orifice.
Ford considers the plain areas on this type of Marksville ware as
the background, and the punctated bands as the decoration.49 While
we hesitate to differ on any point with one who is an authority on
the Hopewellian manifestations in the Lower Mississippi Yalley, we
wish to point out the fact that the bird on the Hopewell vessels is
plain while the subordinate areas are roughened. If the plain bands
on much of the decorated Marksville ware are conventionalizations
of the bird, as a sherd to be discussed under Type 45;23;6 would
indicate, then the roughened areas are still the background.
In contrast to the carefully executed lines of the type treated by
Ford, the sherds of this vessel show incisions with ragged edges.
The entire execution of the design gives an impression of bald work
done quickly and carelessly. In two instances the potter has placed
additional clusters of punctations within the bands which are predominantly smooth.
One rim sherd (Plate 37, o), which occurred at a depth of three
feet in Cut 8, Section 2, has a horizontal band of small elliptical
punctations. The roughened area is separated from the plain bands
by smooth incised lines that are semi-circular in cross section, but
are not as wide as those customarily found on Marksville ware. The
outer wall of the sherd is straight while the interior wall curves

slightly inward, creating a slightly thickened rim which has a flat
lip.

The lip is notched.

This sherd is evidently a variant, for Ford

states that rims of Type

31;23;2
that are straight and not thick’
73
ened, occasionally are notched.SO Both walls of this sherd arc
nicely finished. The paste is gray.

Type 45;23;6 (Marker type)--"Yokena Incised"; there are
thirty.one of these sherds. The decoration consists of bands formed
by deeply incised, wide lines that have been smoothed. Like the
Louisiana and Mississippi type, the lines are curvilinear in the
majority of cases. Only seven, in fact, have designs involving
angles. But these lines, in contrast to those described by Ford, are
widely spaced. Only four of these sherds have bands which are
narrower than the bordering lines. The width between the incisions
ranges from 3 ram. to 1.4 era.
Mr. F. M. Setzler, to whom was sent a sherd (Plate 38, g) having
angular panels separated by deeply incised lines, states that it may
represent the closely spaced incised line technique, but that the
spaces between the grooves are too wide for typical Marksville.Sl
Although no rim sherds of this type were found the body decoration seems to have been separated from the rim by horizontal parallel
lines (possibly two). The body sherds indicate both large and
small straight sided vessels, the former predominating. The smaller
pieces may have belonged to beakers, but the slight curvature of the
large sherds suggests that they belonged either to rectangular pots
or else to vessels having a rather large diameter. The paste is gray
or buff or reddish brown in color. The majority of these sherds,
which are from 5 to 8 ram. thick, have smooth but Unpolished surfaces.
Only two sherds have designs suggestive of the birds that face
each other on Hopewell ware. The better example (Plate 37, a) was
found at a depth of 2 feet in Cut 4, Section 2, where the decorated
Marksville sherds predominated. It is quite hard in texture and has

a design beautifully executed.
In this conventionalization the
smooth bands, which fornl the bodies and heads of the birds, have
been merged with the vertical panel that usually separates them, as
is seen on a Hopewell vessel from the Mound City group, of
Ohio.52 The other sherd (Plate 38, i) has an incised design, composed of concentric triangles, which decoration is similar to that
on the lower part of a composite globular vessel from the Harness
mound group of Ohio.s3 A Marksville sherd, having the same
pattern but much better executed, was found by us on Bayou Macon
in Southeast Arkansas.5z~ By comparing these designs with the bird
motives (which Moore calls serpents) on a Marksville vessel from
Saline Point, Louisiana,S5 it would seem that the concentric triangles are a highly schematized version of the wings of the Hopewell
bird. The decoration on the sherd from the Kirkham midden is also
reminiscent of the grooved triangular areas in the decoration of a
bowl from the Marksville site.56 Ford illustrates a Louisiana sherd
having a design somewhat similar to ours but his specimen has a
punctation within the center of the innermost triangle.n7
In the trench hereinbefore referred to a thin sherd (Plate 38, h) of
gray paste was discovered at a depth of 21/~ feet. It bears a design
composed of concentric bands scparated by deep, smoothed grooves.
This is the only motif made up of concentric circles that was discovered in our excavations, although a number of other sherds,
placed in this group, have curving bands (Plate 38, f) which may

or may not have been parts of circular designs. However, these,
like one figured by Ford,58 may have been parts of a very highly
schematized bird motif in which the body has been elongated and
convoluted somewhat like those in the decoration of a vessel found
by Moore at the Mayer Place, Louisiana.59
The collection from the Kirkham midden also includes one sherd
having a deeply incised spiral (Plate 38, j) which is very similar
to a Marksville sherd from the midden on the Peck Village site in
Louisiana.6o
Ford states that perforations are absent in Marksville ware.61
However, one perforated sherd (Plate 38, e), which was discovered
on the surface at the Kirkham site, has been classified as Marksvillian because of its decoration, which consists of plain bands separated by grooves. With reference to the perforations, it is interesting to note that two Hopewell v~ls from Ohio have holes through
the rims.62

Type 31; 101/102

; 1-2 (Marker type)--"Troyville Stamped":

Of these there are 8 body sherds and 1 rim. The decorative pattern
is made up of broad roughened bands separated from plain ones
by wide and deep incised lines. The roughening on 4 of the sherds
was done with a roulette (Plate 38, L), whereas a notched rocker
was used on the remainder. On both of these sub-types the roughening was executed after the vessels had dried sufficiently for the
impressions to be clear cut. Where the rocker was used (Plate 38,
b, c, k), the plain bands are as wide or slightly wider than the roughened ones; but on all the sherds which have rouletting the plain
bands and roughened panels are of the same width. The roughening on these potsherds, as in the case of the Louisiana sherds, is
close together, and covers the entire surface of the band, with one

exception. In that instance (Plate 33, a), irregularly spaced puncrations begin where the rocker work stops. Unfortunately, it has
been impossible to determine the shape of the vessels to which the
body sherds belonged. The potsherds vary in thickness from 5 to
7 ram. The paste is gray and brown while the exterior surface is
buff, reddish brown and gray in color. Three of the sherds of this
group were found on the surface; the others occurred at depths of
2 and 2 1-2 feet in Cuts 4 and 7, Section 2.
The finest specimen of this type (Plate 37, c) is the rim of a
beaker. The outer rim wall is straight while the inner one curves
slightly, like those previously discussed under the heading of undecorated ware. The design of plain bands and delicately rouletted
panels apparently covered the entire exterior surface of the vessel.
"Ilae smooth portion of the decoration is composed of convolutions
of double parallel bands instead of the single curvilinear panels
which usually occur. These plain bands are separated from each
other, as well as from the roughened areas, by the customary wide,
polished grooves. The double panels, which are plain, have their
counterpart in the decoration of a Hopewell vessel from LaPorte
County, Indiana.63 The unroughened parall,el panels on the latter
specimen, however, form part of a more elaborate decoration, which
is arranged differently. Although our sherd gives only an imperfect
conception of the complete decoration of the original vessel, the
convoluted plain bands were possibly arranged in perpendicular
rows. To the right of the curved parallel bands, just below the
rim and separated from it by the rouletted area, there is a part of an
elongated figure with square ends and concave sides, also composed
of smooth bands outlined by grooves. This figure is somewhat
reminiscent of the straight band that usually separates the birds in
the decoration of Hopewell vessels. Throughout the roughened
panels the rouletting is arranged parallel with the axis of the
panel.
Marksville variant: Two sherds having cross.hatched rims have
been placed under this heading, (Plate 38, m, n). They are related
84;28;9 , but lack the row of hemi-conical puntto Ford’s Type

incised lines parallel with the rim lip.

175

The cross-hatching in both

cases is rather fine, and was done at an angle of forty-five degrees
from the rim lip, both traits of which are characteristic of Ford’s
type. Each rim is straight and has a slightly rounded lip. The rim
walls are 5 and 6 nm~. thick and are .smoothed but not polished.
The paste of one is gray and the other reddish brown. The limited
quantity of shards bearing this type of decoration at the Kirkham
Site is in keeping with Ford’s statement that it is "the least common
of the Marksville types.’’6’*
Coles Creek Complex

Type 61;24; 6 (Marker Type)---"Coles Creek Incised": The 3
rim sherds discovered, of whid~ 2 are illustrated (Plate 39, a, e,),
belonged to bowls with flattened ri~ns. The decoration consists of
closely spaced overhanging incised lines that begin just below the
lip. Two of the specimens have 6 lines and the other has 4. The
sherds with the greater number of lines have slightly incurring
walls, while the wails of the third are straight. The paste is gray.
Their thickness varies from 5 ram. to 1.1 cm. One of these sherds
came from a depth of 2 feet in Cut 4, Section 2, while the remaining 2 were found in Cuts 5 and 7 in Section 1.
61;24;6; "Coles
Creek Incised": But one sherd of this
Type
81;21 -type was found (Plate 39, d). Apparently this rim sherd was part
of a jar. Two incised overhanging lines are close together near the
rim lip, which they parallel. Within the lip there are two incised
encircling lines. The exterior wall of the rim is straight but slopes
inward, while the interior one, which is thickened, forms a right
angle with the rim lip. This rim attains a maximum thickness of
1.5 cm. The potsherd, which was especially well finished, has a
brown paste and darker surfaces.
Type 61;24/21;8 (Marker Type)--"Coles Creek Incised": There
are 2l rims of bowls and beakers (Plate 39, b, m, p). One specimen
has curved walls, while, some of the others have straight exterior and
interior walls, and the remainder have straight exterior but curving
interior walls. The rims range in thickness from 5 mm to 1

Only 2 are thickened. The paste is buff, gray and brown, and
tempered with both shell and grit. Both overhanging lines and
those incised with a pointed instrument were used as the decoration. Although Ford includes only specimens having 1 or 2 lines
in this decorative type,t~5 we take the liberty to extend this same
classification to include our specimens that have more than 2 lines.
Some of them in fact have 5 lines, all of which are parallel with
the rounded rim. The incisions in some cases are close together,
while in others they are comparatively far apart. Because of their
mediocre finish and poorly done motives, these potsherds seem to
be more similar to those Coles Creek sherds found on Deasonville
sites, which Ford states were carelessly executed, irregularly spaced
and often executed with a point.66
Type

61;24;8
; "Coles Creek Incised": Five of the fifteen
81;21
sherds of this type (Plate 39, c) have two overhanging lines; the
remaining number have but one. All of these lines were incised
parallel with the riln. The lines on the five sherds first mentioned
are from i to 1.8 cm. apart. In this connection, Ford states that
the lines of this decorative type "are either closely spac~d or are
more than a quarter of an inch apart.’’67 These sherds also have
either one, two, or three encircling lines incised in the rim lip.
Sherd thickness ranges from 5 to 9 mm. The paste is gray, buff
and brown in color. Some have polished surfaces. Most of these
rims belonged to shallow wide-mouthed bowls. One (Plate 39, k),
however, was probably part of a beaker similar to Vessel V-1401
from Pit 9, Mound B. Crenshaw Place.6~
Type 81; 21/25: These fifteen sherds have a flattened rim lip
in which an encircling line has been incised with a pointed tool.
One rim only has been thickened; and there is no indication of

the use of punctates, nor lugs, such as Ford mentions in connection
with this type69.

The walls of twelve of the sherds rise straight

to the lip, while those of two others curve; the latter belonged to
bowls.

The remaining rim (Plate 39, g) may have belonged to a

pot having a slightly constricted neck, such as vessel V-1440 from
Mound D, Crenshaw Site.7o The sherds are from 5 to 8 nun. thick
and have buff and bro,.~ colored paste.
Coles Creek Variants: A group of 31 incised body sherds has
been placed under this heading, because the motives are insufficient
for the determination of the specific type of Coles Creek ware to
which they belong. Each potsherd is decorated with a series of
parallel straight lines. The number of lines on each piece ranges
from 1 to 8, although this means comparatively little as the decorated fragment is only a part of a larger pattern. Eleven of the
sherds have overhanging lines, while the incisions on the remainder
were done wi~h a pointed tool. ~The lines are both fine and large,
and both neatly and carelessly executed. Spaces betwcen the lines
vary from 5 ram. to 1 cm. The paste is buff, gray and brown. The
sherds are from I ram. to 2.3 cm. thick.
From a depth of 1 foot in Cut 5, Section 1, we removed portions
of a globular shaped bowl (Plate 35, a), which has been reconstructed by the addition of plaster. Its paste is gray. The tempering, unfortunately, could not be positively determined. Both the
exterior and interior surfaces of the vessel had been smoothed; the
exterior, darker in color than the interior, was finished more carefully. The rim lip had been rounded. The vessel, as restored is
11 cm. high, has a basal diameter of 10 cm. and an oral diameter
of 17 cm. Four mm. below the rim and parallel with it, are 2
deeply incised lines 2 cm. apart. Suspended at irregular intervals
from the lower line are groups of slightly curving lines that were
poorly incised. These vary from 2 to 4 cm. in length.
The only decorated sherd having a red slip was discovered in Cut
5, Section 1 (Plate 40, a). It evidently belonged to a bowl, the

Unclassi]ied Decorated Ware

Three body sherds, the exterior surfaces of which had been
brushed with some fibrous material, correspond to Type 11;41 of
Ford’s "Unrelated pottery’’7a grouping. They have a brown compact paste tempered with grit, and were roughly finished. Each
sherd is 6 ram. thick. The type of vessel to which they belonged
could not be determined, but the Caddo brush decorated vessels are
chiefly pot forms. A carbonized deposit, which remains on both the
exterior and interior walls of one of the sherds, points toward the
use of this type of vessel for culinary purposes.
One rim sherd of a semi-spherical bowl (Plate 40, b) has a design which is suggestive of the meanders on some Coles Creek vessels. The sherd, however, is not sufficiently large for definite determination since but two parallel arcs with additional lines, diagonally incised at each side, remain. The curving bands are outlined
by incised lines. The inflection of the upper curve is 1 cm. below
the rim lip, which is flat and Levelled inward. The sherd is 7 mm.
thick. Its paste is gray, as is the interior wall, while the exterior
wall is buff mottled with black. This specimen was found at a
depth of 2 feet in Cut 4, Section 2.
Another rim sherd of a bowl (Plate 40, c) has a design somewhat
similar to the one last described, although the curves are more contracted and the diagonal lines are missing. This buff colored sherd
has a flat rim lip, and is 5 mm. thick.

pressed and interlocked scrolls, was discovered in Cut 2, Section 1.
The deep lines, incised with a pointed instrument, have ragged
edges. Possibly this decoration is a variation of the compressed
meander of some of the Coles Creek types, but there is no indication of cross-hatching or punctates.
A flared rim of brown paste (Plate 40, e) has a motif that is
slightly suggestive of stamped work. Unfortunately, our photograph
is not sharp enough to show this design. Just below the flattened
and slightly extended rim lip there is a row of diagonal panels
raised a little above the intervening spaces. These panels are approximately 5 mm. wide and 1 era. long. Vessels having stamped
motives have never been reported from Arkansas, although earthenware tablets, that may have been used in stamping pottery, were
found by us in the Bayou Macon area of Arkansas.73
In Cut 7, Section 2 at depths of 2 1-2 and 3 feet two sherds, having
a decoration of lines and punctates, were discovered (Plate 40, f).
Apparently they belonged to the same vessel for they both were of
buff paste and 7 ram. thick. It was, however, impossible to fit them
together. In Cut 6, Section 2, we had found another fragment having
a break corresponding to that of one of these pieces. A few other
sherds were found under similar conditions throughout the exacavation, and it is possible that the material present in the slope of this
midden had been deposited as talus or else the aborigines had scattered the broken vessels at random over an irregular surface. Although it cannot be positively determined, the decoration of the
sherds under consideration seems to have consisted of nested isosceles
triangles alternately inverted below a notched rim. Every other
triangle was filled with large punctations made by holding an instrument at an oblique angle. The intervening ones were filled
with straight lines parallel with one of the sides of its triangle.
These sherds seem to be related to Type:

51;21;11 of Ford’s
71

to those discussed by him, are arranged in regular rows, and the

entire decoration was carefully, executed. The incised lines are
semicircular in cross section and suggestive of Marksville technique.
Another decoration related to Type

51;21;11
appears on a
71
flared rim 7 cm. high (Plate 40, g). Alternately inverted isosceles
triangles are also present here but they are separated from each
other by a series of lines, carelessly incised, parallel to the sides of
the opposing triangles. Punctations, triangular in shape and crudely
done, fill the space within each triangle. The sherd is of brown
paste and is 7 ram. thick. A carbonized deposit remains on the
interior of the rim.
Three sherds of light brown paste (Plate 40, h) have incomplete
designs composed of two groups of straight lines.

Each series of

lines was carelessly incised at an angle to the other, and suggests
that the original pattern was a chain of nested triangles. The sherds
are from 5 ram. to 1 em. thick

A straight rim sherd (Plate 40, i) with slightly rounded lip has a
pattern of roughened and smoothed areas suggestive of the Marksville complex. The entire decoration of the original vessel cannot
be determined, of course, but the incomplete design indicates a rectangle outlined and divided diagonally by wide grooves. The upper
triangular half of the rectangle contains three perpendicular rows
of rocker work side by side, while the lower half is smooth. The
rectangle itself is separated from other motives by a broad plain
panel. This sherd, which has a brown paste was found in two
pieces, in separate sections of different cuts.
Two other sherds (Plate 40, j) have designs that are also reminiscent of the patterns on Marksville ware. Their plain and decorated
bands are separated from each other by grooves, but the plain panels
have transverse incisions spaced from 3 to 7 mm. apart. These
sherds are buff colored and 5 mm. thick.
At the base of the midden, 4 1-2 feet from the surface thereof, two
sherds (Plate 40, k) occurred. They are 5 mm. thick and are composed of brownish gray paste. Although the potsherds have closely

spaced rectilinear and eurvilinear incisions, the exact type of decoration cannot be determined because of their fragmentary condition.
At a depth of 4 feet in Cut 7 Section 2 of the midden, a thick
sherd (Plate 40, L) suggestive of the Caddo complex was found.
Its decoration consists of incised lines and a series of impressions
made with a blunt tool which was slightly concave and thinly
notched. It is of gray paste.
Comparison with Pre-Caddo Arti]acts From the Crenshaw Site

The last mentioned trait, although a negative one, seems important in yiew of the fact that Deasonville cord marked ware predominates in the Southeast Arkansas Bayou Macon district. Apparently
it did not manifest itself in the Red and Little Missouri River valleys, in Southwest Arkansas. Its westermost limit still remains to
be determined.
With regard t~o the other complexes, there is clearly a relationship
between the Kirkham Place and sites in Southeast Arkansas. The
Marksville rouletted and incised wares are common to both. They
were however, less abundant on the Bayou Macon. This is also
true of the Coles Creek, although additional research has led us to

Evider~es of the Marksville ~nd Coles Creek Complexes

believe that this complex may have manifested itself more strongly
in southeast Arkansas than we had heretofore thought.
While the Coles Creek is, as yet, the only Pre-Caddo complex to
be found in the Red River valley in Arkansas, there is some evidence
for believing that the Marksville was also’ present in that area.
Setzler has pointed out that certain vessels from the Foster Place and
from sites near Ozan and Washington, in Hempstead County, Arkansas, have Marksvillian characteristics,76 and attention has heretofore
been called to a four lobed jar from the Battle Place in the Red
River Valley, Arkansas, that is quite reminiscent of the Marksville
ware.77

A sherd (Plate 38, d) having a decoration consisting of a punerated panel between incised grooves was recently found by us on
the surface of the Jones Place, which is also in Hempstead County.
The punctations were made by holding a hollow reed or ease at an
oblique angle, forming irregular bisected cones. Mr. F. M. Setzler,
who examined this specimen, has informed us that a few sherds from
Marksville were roughened in this fashion. He further adds that
"the bisected cones are also reminiscent of the customary line of
indentations separating the rim decoration from the neek."T8. This
sherd is thick, tempered with shell and has a gray paste with a brown
exterior color. The Jones Place, as evidenced by four mounds and
much debris throughout the neighboring fields, was extensively occupied during aboriginal times. Burials in the only mound that has
been excavated yielded Caddo pottery. The sherd described above
is the only indication of Marksville so far found there. The Jones
Place is situated on Terre Rouge Creek, one of the principal tribuvaries of the Little Missouri River.
Certain Caddo vessels from Clark County also exhibit some relationship to Marksvillian decoration. Three urns, or cooking pots,
discovered in a mound ten miles from the Kirkham Place have designs
consisting of plain curvilinear bands outlined by wide incised lines

that have been polished.

Two of the specimens also have a back-

ground roughened with a pointed instrument. This mound, as well,
as numerous other Caddo sites in the Ouachita and Red River valleys,
has yielded culinary vessels with patterns that had been incised with
a spatulate tool.
Ford has pointed out the possibility of an evolution of Caddo
design motives from the Marksville.79.

While space forbids a de-

tailed discussion of this in the present paper, his observations afford
a possible solution to the puzzling presence of both incised ve~_~ls
(frequently of inferior quality) and well-made engraved bowls and
bottles in the same Caddo graves.

It is possible that the Caddo

ceramic industry was the result of a fusion of an indigenous pottery
co~nplex with an intrusive one. The former type, represented by pots
having incised designs of scrolls meanders and punctates, may have
survived as culinary ware, whereas the intrusive engraved technique
may have been used in the decoration of vessels for ceremonial purposes. This hypothesis is further suggested by the rarity of incised
designs on Caddo bottles and the absence of engraving on cooking
vessels. Furthermore, in the Muskhogean area of northeast Arkansas
when the engraving technique occurs it appears to have been used
in the depiction of designs having symbolic significance. Generally,
these designs represent the plumed serpent, birds, arm bones and the
swastika. It is also possible that certain motives in the decoration
of the indigenous ware may have been readapted by the Caddo to
the engraved technique, as Ford has suggested,so
The Kirkham Site affords sufficient data for definite establishment of the Marksville complex in Southwest Arkansas, and extends its range both northward and westward to a very considerable
extent in this region. It also extends northward the range of the
Coles Creek complex,el

A RI~PORT ON THt~ ANTI~LOPl~
CREEK RUIN
BY C. STUART JoHr~sol~"
Introduction

The first excavations on theAntelope Creek site north of Amarillo,
Texas, seem to have been done by Eyerly (1907). Later, Dr. W. C.
Holden (1930) carried on additional work at this location and by
means of trenches and the excavation of several rooms was able to
determine something of the size and general characteristics of the
ruin, which he stated was: "One of the largest and best preserved
in the Texas Panhandle." There are numerous sites of the type
here described located in the Panhandle of Texas, and others are
known in Beaver County, Oklahoma. Moorehead (1931) pointed
out the archaeological importance of these locations, and Studer
(1934) has given us a good picture of this culture as described from
Ruin Number 55, which may be taken as typical. In the summer
of 1934 Dr. Forrest E. Clements directed the excavation of a ruin
of this type two miles south of Optima, Oklahoma, through the
cooperation of the Federal Relief Administration. It was the writer’s
privilege to have supervised this work under the direction of Dr.
Clements. Lowery (1932) worked several weeks at the Antelope
Creek Ruin, and mentions having found several pieces of Pueblo
pottery which Dr. Mera of Santa Fe, New Mexico, correlated with
Little Colorado Glaze 1. In a survey by Studer (1931), attention
was called to numerous sites of archaeological interest in northwest
Texas, and the importance of these sites was well brought out by
Moorehead (1933).
In referring to ruins of the type described in this paper various
terms have been used by several writers. They have been designated
as "Slab-House Ruins," "Pueblo Ruins," and "Panhandle Culture
Ruins." This confusion in terminology seems to reflect to a certain
degree a confusion in cultural relationships. Panhandle Culture is
perhaps a better term because it carries no implication of other
cultures that may be involved, and does have a definite geographic
significance. On the margin of the Plains and Pueblo areas one

would expect to find and does find an admixture of culture traits
from both regions.

It is the writer’s purpose here to present a

concise picture of Panhandle Culture as determined from excavations at the Antelope Creek Ruin and to decide as nearly as possible in our present state of knowledge the taxonomic position of the
culture with respect to those of adjacent regions.
The work of excavating completely the Antelope Creek Ruin and
restoring a replica of it in the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum
at Canyon, Texas, was sponsored by the West Texas State College
and made possible through the cooperation of the Works Progress
Administration. Mr. Ele Baker at the present time is supervising the
continuation of field work at a new location under the direction of
Mr. Floyd V. Studer.
Description o] tlte Ruin
Location: The Antelope Creek Ruin is located in the southwest
corner of HutcMnson County, Texas, three miles east and one
mile north of Fritch on the Johnson Ranch, on the west bank of
Antelope Creek.
Geographic en~onrnent: Antelope Creek is a permanent stream
occupying a narrow valley in the High Plains Region of the Texas
Panhandle. The strea~n flows northward through Carson County
and joins the Canadian River several miles beyond the low hill
below the cap-rock on which the ruins are situated. The climate is
semi-arid with an average rainfall of approximately twenty inches
per year. There is little vegetation except that which is typical of
the open plains, such as buffalo grass, sage brush, mesquite, yucca,
and a few cottonwood and willow trees along the stream. Although
the weather is subject to sudden fluctuations in temperature the
summers are not unbearably hot, and the winters are relatively mild.
General Features o] the Ruin: This ruin, like others of the same
type, was first noticed because of surface outcroppings of stone
slabs, generally arranged in rectangular patterns. These surface
indications, which are sometimes joined, but often scattered, represent the foundation outlines of houses, the upper parts of which
have long sinc~ completely disintegrated. Mounds are not present,
and the usually flat surface gives no indication of the depth of the

192

T~za~ Ar¢lwologivcd wnd Pa~eon~ologlcal Society

walls and floor-levels which may be buffed under several feet of
wind-blown dust.
There are twenty-three rooms in the main part of the village,
all of which adjoin each other and extend roughly in a north-south
direction. None of the houses are more than one story in height.
The entrances are all low, averaging about three feet in height, and
all are located on the east sides of the houses. The evidence in this
location does not indicate that the houses were of the semi-subterranean type. Each of the larger houses was provided with two
small rooms which were possibly used for storage, between which
was the entrance-way leading into the main room.
Synopsis of Culture

ztrzhltecture: With a few exceptions the houses are approximately
rectangular in ground plan. The walls are vertical and devoid of
openings except for a small entrance located in the center of the
east side. There seems to have been no prearranged plan in constructing the village. Additional rooms were added as occasion
required.
The walls were constructed by laying a foundation of two rows
of vertically placed rock slabs, which were filled in with adobe
mortar. Above this it seems evident that the slabs were placed horizontally in adobe to reach the required height. The inner snrface of
the walls was neatly plastered with a buff colored mud. Post holes
have been found in seveial of the rooms, indicating the position of
roof supports. Whether or not the roof was flat or sloping toward
the walls is problematical. However, from the charred remains of
roofing material it is certain that the houses were roofed over with
small logs, brush, and clay. Holden’s suggestion** that these
houses were thatched with bear-grass, or roofed with buffalo hides
laid on in the manner of shingles is contrary to present evidence.
Room number seventeen seems to have been the oldest. It was
not as well built as the others, and may have been a temporary

structure for use while the first unit of the main ruin was in the
process of construction. It was noted that the outside wails are
thicker and are constructed of double rows of slabs, while the inner
or transverse wails are relatively thin and only one row of slabs
was used in their construction. This would seem to indicate three
units of construction, beginning at the north and continuing southward. This supposition is also supported by the fact that the
accumulation of debris beneath the ruin under the floors deepens
in a southward direction. If this is true, then the first unit is made
up of rooms 11, 9, 14~ 12, 13, and circular room No. L The second
unit to be added includes room 3, ~ 5, 10, 15, 18, and 19. The
third unit consisted of the larger rooms (2, 6, 7, 8), and the smaller
rooms (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 1). Rooms 18 to 26, inclusive, and part of No. 8 had already been partly excavated when
the present work was started.
Circular room No. 1 may have been used for ceremonial purposes,
but for this there is no definite evidence. It was so badly damaged
by erosion and by partial excavation of an earlier date that only
the wall construction and ground plan could be determined. Nothing was found that would definitely identify it as a kiva.
Fire pits, however, were found in the centers of several rooms,
and it is probable that t_hey existed in the others. The small rooms
on the east side of the ruin that adjoin the larger rooms do not seem
to have been as high as the large rooms, and entrance to them was
probably attained through the roof. Although their purpose is
uncertain, it appears likely that they were used as storage chambers,
as were also tthe circular, rock-lined cists in front of the ruin at the
southeast end.
The floors of the larger roo~ns are unusual in construction, though
characteristic of many of the Panhandle Culture Ruins of both Texas
¯ and Oklahoma. Against the west wall there is an adobe platform,
the purpose of which is unkno~m. This platform is about sixteen
inches in height, and five feet square. From the platform toward
the entrance the floor is flat but depressed several inches, and in
its center is the basin-shaped fire pit. Bordering this depressed
portion of the floor on both sides are ridges several inches high by
about six inches wide, which separate the depressed portion of the
floor f~rom the flat elevated portions that extend to the north and

196

Texas Archeologieal and P~eontologieal Society

south walls.

Over the entire surface the floors are hard and smooth

with a thin pavement of sandy, buff colored clay.

It should be noted also that the small vestibule (Plate 41, Fig. 2)
which constitutes the entrance way into the large rooms is continued
beyond the wall into the room itself. Thus a sort of buttress effect
is produced at the inner entrance of the passage way. Although air
would circulate directly toward the central fire, nothing in the nature
of a deflector has been found in the Antelope Creek Ruin. At the
outer end of tile entrances to rooms 6 and 8 the walls were extended inward several inches to produce a sort of flange. Rock
slabs may have been placed against these flanges to close the entrances.
Pottery: Only one type of pottery has been identified with this
culture. So far as known these were all round.bottomed and globular in shape. There was some slight variation in size, but in general it may be said that they were small as compared to pottery of
the Pueblo Area. None of the pots were provided with handles,
and the only variation in construction appears to have been confined
to the rim which was either vertical in position or inclined outward
at a slight angle. No paint or slip of any kind was applied to these
pots, and the color is black or dark gray probably from use over
the fire as cooking utensils. The surface texture is rough, and the
hardness as defined by March (1934) is about 3.5. In thickness
the sherds average approximately 7 mm. The paste was generally
tcmpered with coarse sand. The inner surface of this pottery is
always smooth, but not polished, and the outer surface is always
decorated with cord impressions. These were stamped into the
plastic clay with either a paddle or a roller wrapped with cord.
The impressions are often at angles to each other, and bear no resemblance to basket-weave. Several pieces of glazed pottery were
found, which evidently came in as trade articles from the west and
thus serve to establish the Antelope Creek Ruin as Early Pueblo IV
of the Southwest. Pottery of this type is not mentioned by Hawley
(1936) among the pottery types of the Southwest. However, the
cord-marked pottery described by Strong (1935) from Nebraska
seems to be indistinguishable from that of the Texas Panhandle, as
does that described by Collins (1932) from Mississippi.
Basketry:

No basketry was found in the Antelope Creek Ruin,

A Report on ~h~ Antelope C~’eek Ruin

197

but in the collections of the Panhandle Plains Historical Society
Museum there are specimens of coiled basketry collected by Studer
from other ruins of this type in the Texas Panhandle. Also the
writer collected for Dr. Forrest E. Clements of the Anthropology
Department of the University of Oklahoma several specimens of
coiled basketry from the Optima site in Beaver County, Oklahoma.
These specimens were, of course, all in a charred, fragmentary
condition.
Arrow Points: The points typical of the Antelope Creek Ruin are
the small side-notched points (Plate 42, Fig. 1). These are always
neatly made, and while they are similar to points found at Pecos as
described by Kidder (1923) they may also be identified with those
described and figured by Strong (op. cir.) from Nebraska. Hence
these points have but little, if any, significance in distinguishing
these ruins from either the Plains or Pueblo Areas as far as culture
is concerned. Knives of several types are shown in Plate 42, Fig. 1,
but the most typical of the culture seems to be the diamond-shaped,
four-edged knife. Hide scrapers and drills, typical forms of which
are shown in Plate 42, Fig. 2 are also found in abundance.
Bone implements: Bone was extensively used in the manufacture of several types of implements, among which awls are found in
greatest numbers. Hoes were made from bison scapulae, and
although the proximal articular ends are often missing, the indication from complete specimens is that they were hafted. The digging edge of the scapula hoe was sharpened with a distinct bevel
in the same manner as the modern hoe. Digging implements were
made from the limb bones of the bison and sharpened to a chisellike point. Some of these were used in the hand while others were
halted by inserting a stick into a hole drilled in the proximal end.
Deer antlers were often used in making handles for various tools,
and as an effective material from which flaking tools could be made.
Also a typical instrument found in this culture is the so-called sounding-rasp.
Pipes: No complete pipes were found in this ruin. However, a
number of fragments were found at Antelope Creek (Plate 42,
Fig. 2) which indicate that the prevailing type was the elbow pipe,
and this is also indicated by similar specimens found in other
Panhandle Culture Ruins. The material of which they were made

198

Te~a~ Areheologlcal and Paleontolog~al So~ty

is usually a fine-grained red, or gray argillaceous sandstone that in
texture, at least, somewhat resembles catlinite.
Ornaments: Ornaments are not abundant in these ruins. A few
small bone beads have been found. Olivella shells were also used
as beads. Shells of the fresh water clam were often found, and were
sometimes carved into pendent-like ornaments as shown in Plate 42,
Fig. 2.
Agriculture: The frequent finding of charred grains of corn,
and charred corn cobs indicates definitely that agriculture was
practiced. It is probable that beans and squash were likewise cultivated, since they seem to be an inseparable part of the maize-beanssquash agricultural complex so widespread in aboriginal America.
The metates on which the corn was ground are elliptical in shape,
and usually made of a coarse-grained sandstone. The oval depression indicates that the grinding motion did not move straight back
and forth but in an elliptical path.
Hunting: The refuse heaps are rich in the remains of numerous
animals upon which these people partly subsisted. No bones of
extinct animals have been found. The collections indicate a faunal
assemblage that did not differ from that of historic times in the
l=Iigh Plains Region. The most abundant bones are those of the
bison and antelope. The larger bison bones are generally broken,
apparently to obtain the marrow. Remains of deer are not unco~nmon. Rabbit, turtle, and occasional bird bones are also found.
Burials: Several burials were found, one of which was in the
southwest corner of room No. 10. The others were all in the single
large room located dowu the hill about a hundred yards from the
main ruin. All were either in a semi-flexed or in a tightly flexed
position with heads pointing to the north and faces to the east. The
individuals ranged in age from about two months to forty-five years.
A knife, a drill, and single arrow point were the only artifacts found
associated with these burials. One burial was uncovered in the east
wall of the house, but the others were in the corners and close to the
PLATE 42.

centers of the rooms in cists which were cut down into the floor.
The cists were oval in ground plan with vertical sides. The bodies
were covered with about six inches of earth, and above this a layer
of rock slabs was placed. In all cases the skulls had been more or
less broken or crushed, but not beyond the possibility of restoration.
Osteological studies relating to the physical type of these people
have not yet been completed. However, it may be stated that the
cephalic index was not high, and that there was no artificial deformation of the skull.
Retazionship
Aside from the fact that stone and adobe were used in the construction of houses there appears to be but little, if any, cultural
influence from the Pueblo Area. In ground plan the houses are
more suggestive of those described by Wedel (193~1~A) from Nebraska. Other than a few sherds, probably representing trade
pieces, Pueblo pottery is completely absent from the Antelope
Creek Ruin. While the circular room described above may have
had some ceremonial significance, it certainly can not be called a
kiva. The work of Bell (1936) on the archaeology of Nebraska
has gone far toward clarifying certain aspects of Plains archaeology.
Pottery, bone and stone implements, as well as the general structure
of the houses are indicative of the Plains rather than the Pueblo
Culture. The affinities and relationships of the Pamhandle Culture
seem to be definitely correlated ~th the Upper Republican Culture
of Nebraska as indicated by Wedel (1934-B) in his preliminary
classification.
It is not likely that the ruins of the Texas Panhandle will ever
be as accurately dated as those of the Pueblo Area. Nevertheless,
a close correlation of the Texas ruins with those of New Mexico by
means of associated pottery gives the approximate date of 1300 A. D.
Furthermore, there is no indication that any of these ruins thus far
excavated were inhabited subsequent to 1540.

A Deep Archa~ologicgl Sitv in Travis County, Texans

A DSEP ARCHAEOLOGICAL SIT~- IN
TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS~
BY A. T.

JACKSON

The deep archaeological site, described below, is located iu Travis
County, Central Texas, and was excavated as a WPA-University of
Texas project.

The site was discovered by Jack Hughes, a student at the University of Texas, who found buffalo bones, mussel shells and a few
flint artifacts, ten feet deep, in the caved-off river terrace.
Deserlption o[ Site
The location is on the south bank of the Colorado River, ten
miles above Austin, in a narrow river valley which is hemmed in on
the south by a range of limestone hills. The elevation in the valley
is about 500 feet, while the nearby hills reach 900 feet above sea
level. The terrace deposits are forty feet above normal low water,
and are being cut into by the river. Just below the junction of the
small branch known as Burnt Hollow, the badly washed terrace
when first visited was strewn with recently exposed camp refuse.
Where there had been no erosion, a two-feet thick deposit of white
sand was on top.
The terrace for one-fourth mile upstream from the branch has
been damaged less by river action. In the exposed vertical faces,
at various depths down to twelve feet, may be seen evidences of man.
Below that point the slope reveals an occasional fragment of burned
stone and mussel shell.
Excavation

Excavation, from December 1, 1938, to March 19, 1939, was confined to that part of the site downstream from the mouth of Burnt
Hollow.
When the work started the ragged crest of the terrace was 45
feet back from the base line, located near the water’s edge. There
*Assistance in the preparation of these materials was furnished by the personnel

was a decided slant of all strata from the hill at the rear toward
the edge of the river.
During most of the time the work was under the immediate supervision of Dr. Kalervo Oberg, but for the last few weeks Mr. A. M.
Woolsey had charge of the crew. The writer visited the site on
numerous occasions and watched the work as it progressed.
Because of Federal safety requirements, the excavation was made
by arbitrary five-foot levels or terraces. The terraces were 185 feet
long and had a total depth of 25 feet. In the floor of the deepest
terrace a number of test pits were dug, extending the depth to 34
feet. In a composite cross-section there were at least nine different
types of soil, repeated at various depths until twenty or more separate "layers" were found.
Cultural remains were present in seven of the nine classes of soil.
Only the recent upper sand and the gravels contained no evidence
of Indian life. One level consisted entirely of midden material.
That was the one containing small, angular fragments of burnt
limestone, intermixed with ashes, charcoal," mussel shells, flintwork,
etc. The greatest depth of cultural remains was 32 feet. At that
depth were three flint chips; and at 29 1-2 feet was a well made
projectile point.
Hearths
An outstanding feature of the site was the presence of numerous
hearths. With the hearths were great quantities of splintered buffalo (Bison bison) bones, charcoal and a number of flint flakes. In
some of the hearths were mussel (Unio species) shells.
The hearths, irregular in shape, had an average size of about
60x60 inches. The depths ranged from 6 feet 8 inches to 26 feet.
Sixty-one per cent of them were at depths between 17 and 22 1-2
feet.
The hearths show a marked similarity to others found in sites along
the Colorado River 100 miles upstream; and to some now being
excavated on the Brazos River, at the junction of the Clear Fork, in
Young County, Texas.

Burial
One burial was found, the bones of which were in an excellent
state of preservation. The burial was located in dark gray soil 1t6
inches from datum, or 63 inches below the present surface. There
were eleven slabs of limestone over the grave. The burial seemed
to have been made in a shallow grave, deepest at its center and
sloping gradually upward to each end. The body apparently had
been forced into the small grave in such manner as to give it the
appearance of a semi-reclining position. The orientation was 30°
west of north. The legs were semi-flexed with the knees upright,
the feet crossed at the ankles, the right arm extended between the
legs with the right hand on the feet, the left arm slightly bent and
extended along the left leg with the hand near the feet.
Mr. T. N. Campbell who examined the skull reported the following
facts:
Sex: Female.
Age: Young adult (21-35).
Measurement of bones:
Head length, 176 ram.
Head breadth, 131 ram.
Cephalic index, 74.4.
(Dolichocephalic verging on mesocephaly).
Notable features:
Marked post-coronoid depression and parietal bosses.
The only artifact with the burial was an engraved turkey bone
protruding from beneath the skull. The decoration on the bone consisted of a spiral band of cross-hatched lines. The specimen may
have been either a hair ornament, a long bead, or a whistle.

Evidences o! Food
Mussell shells and snail shells were in the occupation levels at
various depths. Some deer bones and many buffalo hones were
with" the hearths. Metates and manos suggest the grinding of acorns,
mesquite beans and possibly corn.

ArtiJacts
The strata yielding the most artifacts were the brown sand and the
burnt-rock’ midden deposit. The midden, with about one-eighth the

content, contained almost as many artifacts as the brown sand. The
accompanying composite cross-section shows the relative frequency
of artifacts in the different strata (Plate 43).

These are

of the same ~ype as the ones found in middens of the Marshall Ford
and Buchanan Lake basins.

A study of 300 of these "sinkers" from

the Marshall Ford basin seems to show that they were not in general use by the first occupants of the burnt-rock middens of the
region.
A total of 88 flint projectile points came from the various levels.
The greatest number was found between 17 1-2 and 22 1-2 feet. The
next largest number came from depths of 7 1-2 feet to 12 1-2 feet.
Most of the projectile points found at depths of from 5 to 10
feet are of the small types popularly called "bird points."

These

commonly are found with potsherds in the Central Texas region.
Nearly half of the large projectile points with indented bases were
in the burnt-rock deposit; while 71 per cent of the wide, expanded
base type occurred below the burnt rock.

Two corner-tang knives were found at depths of 14 and

15 feet, or at 3 1-2 to 5 feet below the burnt-rock level.
Thirty-one potsherds of Indian manufacture came from depths
not exceeding 63 inches. Two of the sherds have on them a black
substance that appears to be asphalt. These are strikingly like
certain asphalt-covered sberds found on the Texas Coast.
Comparison a] Specimens with Those From Other Central Texas Sites

An interesting comparison can be made between artifacts from
this site and those from the Marshall Ford and Buchanan Lake
basins, which are located at places about 20 to 100 miles up the
river.
Certain seemingly significant comparisons are:
1. There were more manos at this deep site than at two out of
three burnt-rock middens.

2. There was a much greater percentage of metates than at any
of the burnt-rock sites.
3. Pestle-like stones were more than three times as plentiful as
at the Travis County burnt-rock middens, but less than at sites in
the Buchanan basin.

4. Hammerstones were more numerous than in the burnt-rock
middens.
5, Flint fist axes were fewer than at most of the burnt-rock sites
in Travis County, but more numerous than in the Buchanan basin.
6.

Side scrapers were fewer than at most other sites.

7. End-scrapers had a much larger percentage than in any of
the burnt-rock middens, but a smaller number than in the Buchanan
basin.
8: There were no flint gouges or "core scrapers" in the deep
site, while they appear in varying numbers at other sites. This type
of specimen is suggestive of the celt in shape, with the cutting edge
heavily bevelled. The entire absence of this implement from the
deep site seems significant.
9. The percentage of projectile points was much less than in the
typical burnt-rock middens; e. g., 18 per cent as compared with 70
per cent, 40 per cent and 48 per cent. But the percentage of projectile points in the deep site compares favorably with those in the
Buchanan basin sites. Outstanding types in the burnt-rock middens1
are points with a bevelled tang, chipped on each side from one edge
only; and points with an indented base and secondary chipping
around the edge. The first of these types did not show up at this
deep site. The second was represented by only a ~few specimens.

the large sites in the Buchanan basin than~ to the burnt-rock middens in the Marshall Ford basin. The abundance of manos and
metates and the scarcity of projectile points suggest much food
gathering and little hunting.
Possible Chronology

Definite information on which to base a dependable chronology
of this site is lacking. There are, however, several small clues suggestive of comparative age.
1. Potsherds in the upper levels, in association with a fragment
of European ware, bespeak the historic period for the latest Indian
remains.
2. The burnt-rock midden level appears to be contemporaneous
with the upper levels of the large burnt-rock middens of Central
Texas, and to represent a late prehistoric culture.
3. The human materials removed from the alluvial deposits below the burnt-rock level show a marked similarity to certain discoveries made in 1937 at the Fall Creek Sites2 in Llano and San
Saba Counties, Texas. At those sites the first occupants were the
so-called "burnt-rock people." Their refuse was then covered by
that of a "non-burnt-rock people," who in turn were followed by
more recent burnt-rock users. The intermediate period as repre.
sented at Fall Creek seems to be contemporaneous with the deep
materials at this river terrace site in Travis County.
4. Just what relation may exist between this deep non-burnt-rock
material and the bottom level of the nearby large Central Texas
burnt-rock middens is not clear. The available evidence, however,
suggests that the deep river terrace finds may not be so old as the
bottom burnt-rock midden deposits.
Geological Features o] the Deep Site
The age of the deposits in which the artifacts were found is
largely a geological problem. Dr. E. H. Sellards, Bureau of Economic Geology, the University of Texas, visited the site and spent
some time examining the profile exposed in the excavation. He

also exa~nined an undisturbed river terrace a few hundred yards
distant where the same conditions prevailed. He later sent an
assistant, Mr. Glen Evans, to sink test cores to determine the depth
of bedrock, both in the excavation and on the opposite side of the
Colorado River. Eight test holes, with a diameter of five inches,
were sunk to bedrock. Four of these were in, or immediately
adjacent to, the excavation on the south side of the river. The
others were on the north side of the stream. Dr. Sellards made a
study of the results of these tests and reports as follows:
Geologic Cor,.ditionz
"The locality at which the excavations were made is on the right
bank of the Colorado River about 10 miles above Austin. The river
in this part of its course is cutting through Cretaceous rocks, chiefly
hard limestone, alternating with marls, and is deeply entrenched.
The river valley at this immediate locality has a width of approximately one-fourth mile while the river itself at medium low water
stage is about 600 feet wide. In the river valley at this locality are
terrace deposits which stand at a~n elevation approximating 40 feet
above medium low water. At many places, such as the one where
these collections were made, the river is now cutting into these
posits. At this particular locality only about 150 feet of the terrace
deposits intervene between the river and the south bluff of the river
valley. On the opposite, left, side of the river is lower land and
younger deposits.
"These terrace deposits consist chiefly of silt and fine sand deposited in successive layers by the river. At times of extremely high
flood these deposits are still submerged, and deposition is thus being
continued to the present time. The thickness of the terrace deposit
is 30 or 35 feet. The basal part of the terrace is, of course, appreciably older than the later deposits at the top, but the rate of building by river silt is unknown.
"Borings made across the river valley indicate that the bed rock

on which the river flows Mopes toward the present fiver channel
from both the north and the south bluffs. These borings indicate
that the basal deposits in this terrace rest on a limestone shelf
somewhat above the position of bed rock under the younger deposits on the left side of the stream. Elevation in these borings is
recorded from an assumed datum. Using this assumed datum the
elevation on the limestone bench underlying the terrace deposits in
three bore holes is as follows: 53"7", 51’7", 41"; while the elevation
of bed rock close to the left side of the present river channel is
21’10". If it could be shown that the bench underlying the terrace
deposits was actually the bed of the river at the time these terrace
deposits began to accumulate, it would then follow that the fiver
had lowered its bed rock position 20 or 30 feet since the earliest
terrace deposits at this locality were accumulated. However, it
appears from the borings that no conglomerate or sand bar such
as would be expected in the bed of the river is found at the base of
the terrace. It is, therefore, possible that the entire terrace was built
of silt -,virile the fiver was flowing at approximately its present bed
rock level.
"In connection with the excavations, some few animal remains
were obtained, all of which apparently pertain to living species. In
view of the geologic conditions described and the absence of extinct
animals, one can assign to the deposits of this terrace only such age
as is required in building river deposits by normal overflow arid silting processes through an interval of time sufficient to accumulate the
thickness of the deposits found at this place; which, as already stated,
amounts to 30 or 35 feet. While it is impossible to make any close
estimate on the length of time required in this process it must, of
course, include some centuries, possibly some thousands of years."

Conclusions
The archaeological and geological findings seem to agree that the
cultural materials recovered from this deep site are not very ancient.

SOME UNUSUAL ABILt~NI~ Rt~GION BURIALS
CYRus N. I~Y
During the years of 1937-38-39 several more burials were found
by the writer in the Abilene region, and these revealed a greater
than usual diversity in physical types, and in burial techniques.
Early in October, 1937, three more skeletons of the Stone Slab
Cist Mound burials were found. The first one was of an additional
cist in R. M. (3) which contained remains of another skeleton, which
was very imperfectly preserved (see two pictures of an Abilene long
headed skull on Plate 49). Rodents had gnawed and scattered the
bones in burrows and those remaining were too fragmentary to reconstruct, but evidently had the same type of physical features, and
state of partial mineralization of those previously reported on from
this rnound.1 This brings the number of cists found in R. Mound
(3) up to eleven. The fossil human bones from this, and other
burial mounds of long headed skeletons, adhere to a moist surface
exactly like fossil ~nammoth bones.
Two More Stone Stab Cist Burials
On an adjoining farm the writer found two more stone slab cist
burials, one was a shallow grave under a rock pile in which an
imperfectly preserved skeleton was found buried about a foot deep.
A deep slab rock cist burial was then located close by and arrangements were made with the landowner to excavate it. On the date
arranged a rain prevented the trip. It seems that the rain did not
extend so far as the farm on which the mound was located, and that
then certain unscientific ineddlers intervened and proceeded to wreck
the covered mound which contained two longheaded burials. When
the writer arrived on the succeeding Sunday one skeleton had been
irreparably smashed, and the top of another one then lay exposed,
and the probability was that it soon would also have been destroyed.
The ends of the long bones had been smashed. But for the intervention of such undesirable elements both skeletons could have been
excavated in perfect condition. The writer then obtained perinission

to take out the skull, which was removed in condition so that it was
later reconstructed. No artifacts were found with any of these
burials, It is a very unfortunate condition that so many ranch and
farm owners permit unscientific persons, or even careless boys, to
destroy sites which should be carefully and painstakingly excavated
by trained or experienced scientists, so that the records of the past
might not be lost. There are rarely any artifacts with these burials,
and their excavation by irresponsible persons is pure vandalism.
Sand Dune Cuhure Burial
Sand Dune Culture burials were usually made in the almost pure
sand of the sand dune regions, and it seems that such soils contained chemicals which caused decay of the bones to such an extent
that only small fragments were usually found where they had been
plowed up in fields. In such situations also there were no stone
markers. In one instance where, a, plow had crushed a skull, the
writer found the other bones arranged in a sitting position.
On October 31, 1937, the writer conducted A. T. Jackson and
W. G. McMillan to a burial site situated on the Brazos River Bank
about five miles south of Lueders, Texas (see Plate 50). This site
is in hard soil two or three miles from the sand dune region wbere
the flint implements of this Culture are usually found. This burial,
unlike others of the Sand Dune Culture, was stone covered.
The writer will here incorporate the notes of Mr. A. T. Jackson
concerning our joint excavation of the site.
"Along the river, at the point where this burial was found, there
is a low flood plain, 10 to 15 feet above the normal river channel.
The second terrace, in which the burial was made, is about 45 feet
above the river channel.
"There is a campsite on the gravelly hill to the north and west
of the grave, and a burnt-rock midden some 150 feet south of the
grave. On the surface are many fragments of flint and other stonework, and a few artifacts.
The grave was located some 200 feet west of the east base of the
old second terrace, and 400 feet west of the river, and was discovered by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray. It was easily detected because of
about a dozen fairly large, and some smaller, stones protruding from

230

4 to 8 inches above the present ground surface.

The area covered

by the stones was approximately 60x45 inches.
On removing the top stones others were found beneath, until about
100 were uncovered. They had an average size of about 10x7x2
inches, with perhaps 20 that measured around 15x10x6 inches.
There were found, just beneath the top layer of stones, at a depth
of 8 and 10 inches, two well made serrated projectile points. Ray
classes them as of "typical Sand Dune type" (see Vol. 1 Texas
Archaeological and Paleontological Society Bulletin). A third
projectile point was at a depth of 12 inches and about 10 inches east
of the first two. Three others were found near the right hip at a
depth of 18 inches. The depth of the seventh point, found in dug
soil, is uncertain. Two of the specimens were in perfect condition;
the remaining five had parts missing.
The long, thin specimens were of a good grade of flint and of
excellent workmanship. All of them had more or less serrated
edges. They are very similar to certain points found by the Anthropology Department of the University of Texas in late pre-historic
and historic graves in Cherokee and Anderson Counties, Texas.
There also were two crudely worked or "roughed out" flint specimens in the grave; likewise parts of three small mussel shells, at
various depths.
Topmost of the bones were the socket-ends of the femora, at a
depth of 18 inches. They were in red, hard-packed soil and in a
rather poor state of preservation. The pelvic bone was to the north,
with the knees to the south. The feet were doubled back against
the pelvis. The vertebrae and ribs were beneath the leg bones, with
an increasing depth toward the south. The skull was not uncovered,
because of the approach of darkness, which precluded any further
work that day.
The bones were not mineralized; on the contrary, they were ~ft
and spongy.

While apparently pre-historic, the burial appears to have no great
age."
On the following Sunday the writer returned to the site and
removed the other bones. The vertebrae and many of the ribs lay
near the bottom of the grave. Three more broken points of the same
kind were found close to the ribs. The loose earth excavated the
previous Sunday was screened, and four more points were found.
All of the latter but one were broken, this one was much smaller than
the others but was of the same pattern. Fourteen serrated points
were found (see Plate 51). The number of broken points might
indicate that they were broken when burial was made for reasons
similar to tho~ of the Pueblos who broke the pots buried with the
dead.
There was no trace whatever of the skull. While none of the
bones were very hard, enough were preserved to indicate that had
the head been buried with them some of its parts would have remained, usually the teeth remain longer in good condition than the
other parts of a skeleton, but there were no teeth in the grave. Evidently the head was not hurled with this skeleton. There was nothi_ng unusual in the shafts of the long bones. The articular ends were
in poor condition. There was no flattening of the tibiae nor perceptible curvature of the femora. Such poorly preserved skulls as
have been found however indicate that Sand Dune man was long
headed.
Four Cremated Pit B~
Late in November, 1937, the writer examined a high bank beside
the Brazos River, situated at a distance of approximately thirty miles
northwest of Abilene, and there found four cremation burial pits
of a type not previously found in this region.
While cremated burials in the Abilene region are not new (see ~
and 3) this type is somewhat different from the others previously
found.
The top of the hill at this place extends close to the river and
has there caved off into a steep bank, the top of which for about
six to eight feet is vertical. All along the edge near the top is the
exposed debris of a campsite, which is covered with about a foot
or more of sterile soil. This layer of debris is about eight inches

234

thick. At two places the writer noticed that the top soil had washed
off of layers of flat stones which were considerably larger than the
fist sized stones of the camp site, and that these were laid closely
and horizontally in two layers. On climbing up from below, it was
noticed that the clay bank had caved off in such manner as to expose
the sides of two large round jar like pits in the earth. These pits
were capped over the tops with double layers of horizontally laid
flat stones, which were mostly ten or twelve inches across. In the
Pit (1) or left hand pit, was a closely flexed skeleton in sitting
position with the face to the east, and just below the legs and in
front and below it to the east was the skeleton of a small child.
This pit was 43 inches deep below the cap stones, and the bottom
was rounded out like a basin. Around the upper parts of the adult
skeleton were quantities of ashes and charcoal as though the bodies
had first been placed in the pit, a fire made on top of them, and
then the pit ~ealed over with the stone layers. No artifacts were found
in this pit burial, but several large unworked mussel shells were
buried with them. None of the bones were scorched.
Pit (2) was only a few feet east of the first one and this pit contained another adult similarly buffed, and it was of about the same
depth. It also had several large mussel shells in it. There were
two small thin plain triangular un-notched arrow points in this
grave. It also showed the same signs of fire in the upper portion
of the pit. None of the bones were scorched.
We then began making test holes in the top earth back of the
vertical bank, and there found another similar stone structure about
two feet north of Pit (2). On excavating Pit (3) we found that it
was much shallower and smaller than the others. It contained quantities of ashes, charcoal, and fine burnt fragments of bone, and shell.
Considering the shallow depth of this pit it must have contained the
results of a child’s cremation. This cremation had been so complete that no specimens were obtained. The pit was about 18 inches
deep. About the same distance north of Pit (1), a test hole showed
a fourth stone structure, which was about three feet deep. This
Pit (4) contained burned fragments of an adult’s skeleton, and
burned mussel shells, and more charcoal and ashes than the others.

The writer knows of two other sites near Abilene where unknown
persons have excavated several cremated burials, and scattered such
remains around over the soil surface, but there is nothing left now
except charred human bone fragments to indicate the manner of
burial of the remains.
The two adult skulls from these pit burials were in fairly good
condition. Evidently tbe pit was sealed over the top before the fire
had acted on the bones. Both of the skulls are long headed, and have
considerable similarity to the Abilene type, but none of the long
bone features exist. The tibiae are not flattened, nor are the shafts
of the fenmra curved, but are as straight as those of any modern
white man. Considering the shallow covered camp site position in
the earth, from which the pits were originally dug, the writer does
not believe that these burials are of any considerable age, although
the campsite shows no evidence of any historic occupation.
However, some of these relatively shallow sub-surface pre-historic
sites may be much older than we how assume. The remains of some
Roman occupation levels are said to be not very deeply buried also.
Burial Over Nine Feet Deep
At a place on the Matthews Ranch situated thirty miles north of
Albany, Texas, and about two miles south of the site where the
writer first found two skeletons of the Abilene type of dolichocephalic
man’~ a small boy found a skull exposed in a deeply buried stone
cist in a high vertical Brazos River bank. As usually happens in
such cases he did not leave the bones in place, and did not notify
some one capable of properly removing it, but removed it in fragmentary condition. Thus far the writer has not been able to get to
see the skull. Shortly thereafter Mr. J. C. Putnam heard of the
find and kindly notified us.
A visit was made to the site in August, 1938, and the following
facts learned. Fortunately the ground was hard and the footing so
insecure that the boy had left the other bones in the bank.
At this locality there is a west facing river bank of an estimated
height of between thirty.five and forty feet which slopes steeply
down to the water’s edge. There is a vertical section of this bank at
the top which is about twelve feet high. Below the vertical section
the bank is so steep that steps had to be cut for footholds in digging

238

out the burial. At a depth below the surface beginning at seven
feet the pinkish tan earth is replaced by a dark colored earth zone
which contains burnt hearth rocks, flint flakes, charcoal, numerous
mussel shells, and animal bone fragments.
This dark colored midden zone extends downwards to a little
below eight feet from the surface, where it is again replaced by pinkish tan silt, which extends without much color change to below the
water’s edge.
In none of the pinkish soil levels either above or below the black
midden zone is there evidence of a campsite with the exception of
one very deeply buried hearth, which lies 30 feet or more below
the top soil surface, and contains burnt rocks, charcoal and mussel
shells. (See Plate 55, No. 3).
In most of the levels below ten feet only occasional mussel shells
and stones of hearths are seen. The black zone however, is thickly
studded with hearths and the other debris of an old campsite.
When viewed from below the bank the old midden level’s black
band may be plainly seen exposed down to a depth of more than
eight feet below the present soil surface, and extending for a distance of perhaps two hundred yards or more at this place. It is
¯tudded with mussel shells, burnt rocks, and occasional flint flakes.
The burial had been made from below the bottom of this black
zone, and the measured vertical distance below the soil surface to
the top of the skeleton was nine feet and two and one-half inches.
(9 ft., 2½ in.). (See Plate 52, Nos. 1, 2 and 3). Over the top
of the skeleton was a limestone structure of stones (see Plate 52,
No. 2) none of which were over a foot in diameter. The skeleton
lay in flexed position under the stones with the head to the southwest
and apparently lying on the back. (See Plate 52, No. 3). There
were many small mussel shells immediately above the burial stones,
and all amongst them. At a distance of about two inches above the
layer of stones which covered the bones, was a solid layer of the

~hells of the same species of small mussel mentioned above. These
shells were thickly laid like shingles with the convex surfaces
upward and the shells closely overlapping. The effect would have
been to shed rain off of the grave, and it probably represents the old
soil surface when burial was made. This layer was close below the
bottom of the black midden zone. As there was no sign of any disarrangement of the soil, either in the black midden zone above, nor
of the pinkish tan soil above that, it is evident that the burial was
made-at a period shortly before the deeply buried midden level began
to aecumulate, or from an old floor level above which slightly more
than eight feet of silt has since accumulated. The burial was originally probably enly about fourteen inches below the soil surface
of that period.
The long bones were mostly found in good condition except some
projecting articular ends of arm bones which evidently had been
broken off by those who removed the skull. The leg bones were
nearly intact, and appear to have most of the peculiarities of those
reported on by Dr. Hrdlicka in the 1938 issue of this Bulletin.
However, the internal surfaces of the tibiae are also very deeply guttered, which is a feature not previously noted in tibiae from the
Abilene section.
This burial represents the deepest buried, and possibly one of the
oldest yet found in the Abilene region, although far deeper midden
levels have often been found by the writer in the same region. A
competent physical anthropologist will be asked to examine these
bones~also, and a report in more detail can then be made.
The mussel s~lls fOUnd with this burial vary in size very little,
~d evidently are only of one species, contrary to the usual practice, which was to use shells of several much larger species, and of
various sizes. There must have been several gallons of these small
shells with the burial, ~ writer preserved a large paper bag full
of whole shells. These range from 1~ to 2 inches in diameter, and
are nearly round, with plain outside surfaces. In no other local
burial has such a great quantity of shells been found. Usually there
are not more than from three to six or eight large mussel shells
buried with the long headed flexed skeletons.
1939 Excav~ns
During the year 1939 four more burials were found.

The first

242

Texas Archeological and Paleontological So~ty

one, found in January, was incomplete.

This burial had eroded

from the gullied bank of Mulberry Creek at a place about fifteen
miles west of Abilene.

Only the complete frontal bone and some

fragznents of the lower portion of the skull were found.
burial was a flat sandstone metate.

With this

Not enough was found of this

skull to determine much about head shape but it seems to be of a
long head.
Shallow Burial
North of Abilene about twenty-five miles, on top of a hill situated
about one-fourth mile from the Brazes River, two stone grave burials
were found. The first of these A. M. (3) was covered with a surface
pavement of limestones set closely together; this structure measured
about six feet across.
Beneath this surhce layer were two long flat stones set up edgewise with other flat stones lying horizontally in the space between
them. Under the horizontal stones a flexed skeleton lay on its back.
The skull was badly crushed by the weight of the stones.
The left femur of this skeleton showed much evidence of bone
disease. The shaft showed exostoses (bony outgrowths) and the
head of the bone was deformed, muc~ mushroomed, and eroded. The
writer has looked closely for evidences of bone erosion, such as
syphilitic involvement would cause, in the many burials which he
has previously excavated; but this is the first instance where any
such signs of bone disease have been found except one Abilene skull
which had exostoses which closed the ear openings.
This burial was unusually shallow (20 inches) and many of the
long bones were in fragile condition, however the femur was the
best preserved. This skull was placed in the local museum and left
embedded in the matrix as found. The burial is prehistoric, but
probably is not very old. There was little or no mineralization of
these bones. No artifacts were found.

This single burial was made under a heavy stone structure which
extended down to a depth of three feet and eight inches. The top of
the stone structure measured seven by seven feet. A total of sixtyfive large flat limestones were removed from the grave. Near the
bottom some large stones were set edgewise and in the bottom under
these were other flat stones lying horizontally. Under the bottom
horizontal layer was a flexed long headed skeleton, the head of
which lay to the south. The bottom six inches of the hole had been
cut down into the hard caliche. This skeleton was in a state of
chalky mineralization, and probably is of an older type than that
of Burial A. M. (3). No artifacts were found with this burial.
Reek Shelter Burial With Basket
In southern Nolan County, about forty-five miles southwest of
Abilene there is a rock shelter which contains much ashes and midden
debris. On the walls of this shelter are seven negative hand prints.
These negative prints are in white, outlined in red. Evidently the
wall had been moistened, and then the outspread palm of the hand
was placed on the stone, and red powdered oxide of iron thrown
against it. This left the hand outlined in red. Apparently the iron
went into and became part of the limestone (see Plate 53, Nos. 2, 3).
Such hand prints are world wide in distribution, and some in Europe
are undoubtedly thousands of years old. Also on the same ledge
is a typical basket maker square-shouldered man’s figure, cut into
the stone (see Plate 53, No. 1). This figure holds two spears, one
in each hand, and two other spears are shown sticking into his body.
Unfortunately vandals have about obliterated the man’s figure,
and are still engaged in scratching the hand prints off of the rocks.
In July, 1939, while Mr. Forrest Kirkland was copying these
pictographs in colors, W. C. Fields, the nephew of the owner of the
ranch, began to dig in the floor of the rock shelter, and soon unearthed a human lower jaw, and a basket. The writer was notified
by Mr. Kirkland and on visiting the place was able to locate the
skull. The burial was of a child of about eight years of age, and
the skull is well preserved with the exception of some portions which
rats had gnawed. The skull does not resemble those of the Abilene
~pe of long headed man, but is that of a more modern Indian type.
The burial had been made in a narrow space between the back wall

246

Texas Arch¢ologieal ~nd Paleontological Society

of the shelter and the edge of a huge stone which had at some time
fallen from the roof (see Plate 54, No. 1). Smaller stones had
been used to cover over the top of the space between. The basket
had been gnawed on the edges by rats, but large portions of the
edge were intact as well as the center of the basket, with the exception
that a circular section 3½ inches in diameter had been cut out of
the center. The cut was clean, and undoubtedly made by a knife
of some sort, and this portion had not been gnawed. Lying inside
the basket was a thin sharp flint flake.
The basket is badly warped, but the texture is firm, and in good
condition. The material seems to be of willow sticks, and yucca
blades. (See Plate 54, Nos. 2 and 3).
There is a dark colored band one-half inch, or three stick widths
wide, at a distance of 1 1-16 inches or seven woven stick widths
below the basket edge. The band shows inside as well as outside,
and may have been woven in of previously colored blades instead
of being painted on afterwards. There are some darker portions
below and above the band which may have been decorations, but
of this the writer is uncertain. The basket is 111/~ inches in diameter.
The cut out central disk probably was done at the time of burial
in conformity with the Pueblo Indian belief that objects buried with
the dead should also be "killed" or broken. This is the first specimen of Indian basketry ever found in the Abilene region, in so far
as this writer knows.
At this site thick deposits of ashes and burnt rocks extend down
to a depth of at least five or six feet or more. Test holes revealed
three different strata of ashes, each of which was separated by a
sterile layer. The top layer is separated by a sterile layer which
is only a few inches deep, but the sterile stratum between the second
and third layers of ashes is broad. One of the deeper layers of ashes
extends under the huge fallen rock below the hand pictographs and
petroglyph. (See Plate (54) No. (1)). The pictures were made

along the rock face which was left exposed when the rock fell, and
they evidently were made at a much later period than the one when
the deeper layers of ashes were deposited.
Small arrow heads are found in all layers. The land owner, Mr.
M. U. Brownfield, who has done considerable digging there, believes
that the larger projectile points are found only in the top layer, and
the fine thin small points in the lower levels.
However the writer found the small thin points in the top level
also. Some obsidian flakes, and a few potsherds have been found
in the site by others.
Types o] Artifacts
The writer found obsidian flakes, but no potsherds. One polished
stone bead was found. The types of small arrow heads found come
within the classification of pottery culture types, which were illustrated by the writer in Vol. 7, 1935, Bulletin of this Society, in an
article entitled "The Pottery Complex Artifacts of the Abilene"
Region," Plate 8. According to that classification, the writer found
in the rock shelter the following artifacts, 1 (P. Flake drill) ; seven
points of (P. Arrow B.) two of (P. Arrow D.), although these
lacked the notch in the base; two more of this triangular type had
two notches on each side near the base; three small slightly expanded
based barbed points like those shown to the left of the obsidian
flakes on row 5 of the plate 8 cited above; three plain triangular
points (P. Arrow E.).
One medium sized roughly flaked knife was found. Several very
small knives which were flat on one side and pointed at each end,
were found. These knives were about 1 1-2 inches in length.
No oval pottery type scrapers were found of any of the types
illustrated on plate 10, panel 129 of the Bulletin referred to above.
A few side scrapers, and many thin flake knives were found.
Much indiscriminate digging has been done at this site, but thus
far no systematic attempt has been made to excavate it.

Excavation at/lrrowhead Ruin

During the month of June and the first half of July of this year,
1939, Texas Technological College conducted its fourth season of
excavation at Arrowhead Ruin which is located two miles east of
Glorieta, New Mexico. Previous expeditions had been made in
1933, 1935, 1937.
Arrowhead Ruin is located on a masilla overlooking the Pecos
valley. It is in the lower Sangre De Cristo mountains and has an
elevation of 7,300 feet. Excavation rights were given to the college
by the owner, Mr. Thad C. Slaughter, in 1933.
¯ Prior to this summer, forty-two rooms and a kiva had been excavated, and three rooms and the kiva reconstructed. During this
season thirteen rooms, a passageway, and four trenches were excavated.
In all, approximately 36,000 items, including potsherds, have
been found, tabulated as to stratigraphy, and classified as to type.
The findings of the first three seasons were incorporated into a
report by Mr. William M. Pierce, now instructor in the Department
of History and Anthropology, Texas Tech, and submitted as a
Master’s thesis. The findings of 1939 are now in process of being
put into a report by Mr. J. Merrill Kayser.
There still remain three or four seasons of work for completion of
the ruin. When the ruin is completely excavated it is our intention
to issue a final report incorporating all phases of excavation and
the findings.

Is the ~tmerican Mano o] Pleistocene/tge?
Several times since 1930 the writer has found mano stones in the
loose gravel of the Gibson Site close to the bottom of the vertical
bank which contains superimposed midden strata, at 24½, 27 and
30 feet below the present soil surface.
In 1930 he found a mano stone on the creek bed immediately below

252

T¢~cas A~’¢h~o~ogical ~c~ Pa~eo~tologlcal

a large hearth buried 241/~ feet deep, the hearth contained burnt
stones, charcoal and a few man-made flint flakes. The mano lay in
loose gravel as though it had just fallen out of the bank above. In
1936 another mano stone was found below the same bank. This
mano has the same type of mineral incrustation which adheres to the
paleolithic type Abilene Points (Ray) found at this site embedded
in the 241~ feet deep stratum.
In August, 1939, the writer again visited the Gibson Site, and
then saw exposed about two inches of the edge of what seemed to be
a mano stone. This was embedded firmly in the red clay, along
with some charcoal, at a depth below the present soil surface of
thirty feet. On excavating this stone he found it to be a typical mano
firmly fixed in the hard, red clay and charcoM stratum (see Plate
55, ~qos. 1, 2). The mano is just above the handkerchief in both
pictures.
This is the same Gibson Site where an elephas leg bone was found
embedded in gravel in the bank at a place a short distance farther
up the creek. This leg bone lay at approximately the same age
level, if not above that of the mano stone.
In 1937 the writer dug out a mano and portions of a metate buried
19½ feet deep in a charcoal stratum at the Hodges Site. This site
is located about thirty miles northeast of the Gibson Site. The writer
dug back into the hard silt eighteen inches to find the mano and
metate fragments. At that site the grinding implements were in a
stratum containing quantities of charcoal, burnt rocks, mussel shells,
and some flint flakes.

OBITUARY
Dr. J. E. Pearce, Head of the Department of Anthropology of the
University of Texas, died on October 22, 1938, at his home in
Austin, Texas.
Dr. Pearce at the time of his death was in his seventieth year. For
a great many years his was as a "voice crying in the wilderness"
for the establishment of a great State Museum. For this purpose
he carried on a constant fight against great odds.
For far too long it seemed that anti-science was intrenched, and
that truculent ignorance was in the saddle in Texas. But at last this
resistance to progress was overcome, and it was very largely due to
Dr. Pearce’s efforts that Texas now has the beginnings of a very
creditable mutton at Texas University.
Dr. Pearce was the pioneer in scientific exploration of Texas
archeological sites, and in publication of the results of such investigations. His Texas archeological writings cover a period of from
1916 to 1938. Texas lost a valuable crusader for science in the
passing on of Dr. Pearce.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
SOCIETY
Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
The Texas Archeological Society (TAS) offers a wide range of opportunities for
those interested in Texas heritage. The mission of the Society is to promote study,
preservation and awareness of Texas archeology, A recent strategic plan ca~ls for the
Society to create training opportunities for students, enhance and expand programs,
increase and diversify membership, inform the community of their archeological heritage
and cultivate and preserve resources. The membership generally numbers around 1400.
The Society calendar begins in October with the Annua~ Meeting, an event that
has taken place since 1929. Archeologists, professional and avocational, get together to
share information in research sessions and to hear from nationally renowned luncheon and
banquet speakers. Friday is a popular evening for the public forum with high profile
speakers and artifact identification. Meetings will be he~d in Lubbock (08) and Del Rio (09).
Each spring TAS offers sessions of the Texas Archeology Academy. Topics in
this series of workshops include Archeology 101 (including a field day), Ceramics: The
Stories Pottery Tells, Lithics: Reading Stone Too~s, Historic Archeology and Rock Art of
Texas. Each Academy features power point presentations, a manual and hands-on
activities to reinforce concepts presented. In 2009 sessions will be held in Georgetown,
Study Butte, and Lake Jackson. Surveys at the close of sessions reveal that participants
greatly value the information imparted during the workshop and the camaraderie of fellow
students.
The summer brings a field school that offers an opportunity for fo~ks to
contribute to research about Texas archeology. The principal investigator is supported
by staff and experienced volunteers. Usually around 300 people participate. Newcomers
appreciate an orientation session before joining crews in the field.

Survey and lab

sessions provide other venues for people who want to ~earn more about the archeological
process.

The field school in 2009 wil~ be in the Panhandle near Perryton.

We offer

scholarships to college students and Native Americans. A youth program instructs around
60 students each year.
Publications of the Society include a journal, the Bulletin of the TAS, a quarterly
newsletter and two web sites,

is the organizational web site that re~ates

current programs and opportunities. Theother website is
venue that offers information in the form of multi-level exhibits.

,a
TAS has been a
