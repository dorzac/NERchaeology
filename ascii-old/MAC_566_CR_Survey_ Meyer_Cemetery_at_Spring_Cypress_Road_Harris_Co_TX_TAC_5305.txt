ABSTRACT
On June 23, 2009, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted cultural resource
investigations along the north side of Spring-Cypress Road, in northern Harris County, Texas
(Figures 1, 2).
The investigations (MAC PN 09-27) were conducted for The Harris County
Public Infrastructure Department under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5305. The project area
lies close to the historic Meyer Cemetery. Harris County was aware of the new Archeology
Division regulations in regard to ground disturbance in proximity to recorded cemeteries, as well
as the occasional occurrence of unmarked graves outside the currently visible boundaries of such
cemeteries. The County therefore requested a proposal to determine with a justifiably high level
of confidence whether or not human burials are present within the narrow, existing Right-of-Way
(ROW) alignment within which almost all project construction will be confined (the possible
exception is at the location of the entry drive to the tract containing the cemetery, where slight
grading may extend beyond the County ROW). This project was tailored to that objective, as
well as to assessing the presence or absence of any other class of significant archeological
deposits within the subject property.
A mechanized subsurface survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface
and subsurface (backhoe trench) examination. A single, 25 m long backhoe trench was
excavated. After some shifting of the excavations to avoid areas of utility construction, the trench
revealed undisturbed soils consisting of a truncated, ca. 20-cm thick layer of gray-brown sandy
loam underlain by mottled gray-brown and reddish-brown clays to the base of the trench at about
1.2 m below the undisturbed surface of the adjacent private property.
No trace of grave shaft stains or other evidence suggesting the presence of human burials was
found by this trench that sampled a large proportion of the proposed Limits of Work. The Limits
of Work was further demonstrated to have been disturbed by considerable prior utility excavation
and construction. We are confident that there are no human burials or other archeological
deposits of significance present within the ROW area. We recommend that no further
archeological investigations be conducted prior to project construction in this zone.
In the event that additional archeological deposits or features should be encountered during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
On June 23, 2009, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted
cultural resource investigations along the
north side of Spring-Cypress Road, in
northern Harris County, Texas (Figures 1,
2).
The investigations (MAC PN 09-27)
were conducted for The Harris County
Public Infrastructure Department under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5305.

The project area is depicted on the
Rose Hill and Tomball, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 2).
The narrow, linear area of investigation is
confined to within the Right-of-Way, Limits
of Work for the road improvement as
depicted on Figure 3, an area approximately
130 ft. long by 10 ft. wide (ca. 40 x 3 m).
This linear ROW area was approximately
75-ft from Meyer Cemetery at their closest
approach (Figure 4). The Limits of Work
was investigated in a manner consistent with
the methodology described in the Scope of
Work for the project: a single trench about
3-4-ft wide was excavated in the ROW on
the Meyer Cemetery side of Spring-Cypress
Road (Figure 5).
The existing ROW
currently exhibits a drainage ditch whose
sloping shoulders occupy most of the area of
the ROW.

The project area lies close to the
historic Meyer Cemetery. Harris County
was aware of the new Archeology Division
regulations in regard to ground disturbance
in proximity to recorded cemeteries, as well
as the occasional occurrence of unmarked
graves outside the currently visible
boundaries of such cemeteries. The County
therefore requested a proposal to determine
with a justifiably high level of confidence
whether or not human burials are present
within the narrow, existing Right-of-Way
(ROW) alignment within which almost all
project construction will be confined (the
possible exception is at the location of the
entry drive to the tract containing the
cemetery, where slight grading may extend
beyond the County ROW). This project was
tailored to that objective, as well as to
assessing the presence or absence of any
other class of significant archeological
deposits within the subject property.

A mechanized subsurface survey of
the project area was conducted, and included
both surface and subsurface (backhoe
trench) examination. A single 25 m long
backhoe trench was excavated along the
project ROW (Figure 2).
The field
investigations were conducted by Roger
Moore, Randy Ferguson and Sally
Morehead. Roger Moore served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
watershed. Though once a natural
streamcourse, Faulkey Gully has been
extensively modified over the years by
efforts to reduce erosion and urban flooding.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The project area is depicted on sheet
30 of the Soil Survey of Harris County
(Wheeler 1976).
The single soil type
present in the tract is Gessner complex (Gs).
This soil type is identified as poorly drained
with very slow runoff (Wheeler 1976:15).
Abbott (2001) defines Beaumont soils as
upland loamy ancient (pre-Holocene)
alluvium, with a low-moderate potential for
containing deeply buried prehistoric sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,

Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches

include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

fated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).
The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
reconnaissance survey of selected portions
of the Cypress Creek watershed in Harris
and Waller Counties (Freeman and Hale
1978). This survey was done at the behest
of the Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, who was seeking to assess the
significance of archeological and historical
resources within the watershed prior to
developing a predictive drainage basin
model. This model would be used to aid in
planning future flood control modifications
in the Cypress Creek watershed. Since the
sizable basin (320 square miles) could not
be entirely surveyed, the investigations were
concentrated on the 100-year flood plain as
this would be the most likely portion to
experience modifications. Approximately
20 percent of the floodplain was surveyed.
Some reconnaissance was also conducted in
selected upland areas contiguous to the
floodplain. The investigations resulted in
the recording or reevaluation of 58
prehistoric sites and the recording of 25
historic sites (information on many other
historic sites was gathered but formal
recording was not completed). The study
indicates that there is a relatively high
density of prehistoric and historic sites
within the Cypress Creek floodplain and its
adjoining uplands. En masse, the prehistoric
sites are described as small in size and
believed to reflect general camping
activities.
More specific site function
interpretations were not attempted due to the
limited scope of the reconnaissance. The
study area produced artifacts ranging from
the late Paleoindian period to the Late
Prehistoric period. Historic sites included
cemeteries, houses, churches, sawmills,
roads, road crossings, bridges, schools,
railroads, stage stops, and resorts. In the
main, these sites date to the mid-to-late
nineteenth century and early twentieth
century.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in, or within the immediate
vicinity (Â½ km) of, the project area.
A limited amount of archeological
work has been conducted on Faulkey Gully.
In 1990, personnel from Texas A&M
conducted an intensive survey of a 43-acre
tract centered on a section of Faulkey Gully
located approximately 1.8 kilometers above
its confluence with Cypress Creek (Ensor
and Moore 1990). The investigation was
done in advance of channel dredging within
Faulkey Gully. No cultural resources were
located. Only one recorded site, 41HR572,
has been previously identified along Faulkey
Gully. The site appeared to represent a
small prehistoric occupation, and is located
approximately 3.2 miles (5.1 km) southeast
of the east end of the project. First reported
in 1985 by avocational archeologist John
Leftwich (TARL records), an attempted site
revisit by the Texas A&M University project
in 1990 failed to relocate the site (Ensor and
Moore 1990).
From a more regional perspective,
the current project is located within the
Cypress Creek watershed, where a large
number of investigations have been
conducted over the last three decades
(Dureka 1998; Porter 2003). In 1977, The
Texas Archeological Survey, The University
of Texas at Austin, conducted a

An attempt was made to relocate previously
recorded site 41HR394, the Cypress Creek
crossing of the Old Washington Road. This
crossing point was no longer visible.
However, a short segment of raised roadbed
located in another portion of the project may
be a surviving remnant of the road (Moore
1992).

in advance of the construction of a road
extension across Cypress Creek (Moore
1985).
No archeological sites were
recorded, and site 41HR525, a prehistoric
site recorded by avocational archeologists
from the Houston Archeological Society and
lying near the proposed construction
corridor, was determined to be destroyed by
clearing and erosion.
In 1989, the Archeological Research
Laboratory of Texas A&M conducted an
intensive survey of a rectangular 645-acre
tract, centered on a 13.5 mile segment of
Cypress Creek, in northern Harris County
(Ensor 1991). This investigation was done
in advance of proposed flood control
maintenance activities along a segment of
Cypress Creek. Four previously unknown
sites (41HR628 to 41HR631) were recorded
during the survey. Three of these sites were
prehistoric, yielding lithic debris, ceramics,
bone, and charcoal. All were deemed
potentially eligible for the NRHP; the
fourth, a scatter of modern structure
remains, was determined ineligible. Twelve
known sites, all prehistoric, were reassessed.
Of those, sites 41HR374 and 41HR375 were
determined to have possible subsurface
intact deposits and recommended for
eligibility testing.

In 1993, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an intensive
survey of 143 acres on Little Cypress Creek
approximately 1.5 kilometers northwest of
its confluence with Cypress Creek (Moore et
al. 1994).
This tract is located
approximately 4.5 kilometers west of the
current project area. The survey was done
in advance of the construction of a
floodwater detention facility along Little
Cypress Creek. A single historic cemetery,
the Roeder/Becker Cemetery, was record as
41HR750. An isolated find of a single flake
was noted.
In 1994, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., again performed a survey
in the Cypress Creek watershed (Moore and
Daigle 1996). This 50-acre investigation
took place on the banks of an unnamed
tributary of Cypress Creek at the western
edge of Harris County. The survey was
done in advance of a creek bank mitigation
project. No cultural resources were located.

In 1990, Texas A&M returned to
Cypress Creek to conduct National Register
eligibility testing at prehistoric sites
41HR374 and 41HR375 (Ensor et al. 1991).
Test units and backhoe trenches were
excavated at both sites, and it was
determined that neither site was eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.

In 1996, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an intensive
survey on a 488-acre tract along the north
bank of Cypress Creek in northern Harris
County (Moore 1997).
Cypress Creek
defines the southern border of the tract, and
the eastern edge of the tract sits at the
confluence of Cypress and Spring Creeks.
This investigation was done in advance of
the construction of a golf course. Thirteen
previously unknown sites (41HR584 to
41HR596) were recorded, and previously
recorded site 41HR371 was revisited. The
newly recorded sites were characterized as
sparse subsurface lithic scatters, small in

In 1992, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resources survey of a 90-acre tract, the
proposed location of Telge Park in Harris
County on Cypress Creek (Moore et al.
1994).
This investigation recorded six
prehistoric sites (41HR717 to 41HR723), all
of which were determined to be eligible for
SAL designation. Site 41HR720 was the
only site that produced chronologically

however, Moore states that the remains
resemble portable sawmill remnants found
elsewhere in Harris County. Nine of the sites
were recommended for further investigation
if they were to be impacted by detention
basin construction.

size and producing no diagnostic artifacts.
A reassessment of 41HR371, a larger site
dating to the Early Ceramic Period, found it
to be in good condition and worthy of
protection.
All sites identified and
reassessed during the survey were deemed
eligible for nomination as SALs and

construction.

In early 2003, an additional survey
was conducted by personnel from Moore
Archeological
Consulting,
Inc.,
approximately 1.5 kilometers upstream
(west) of the 129-acre tract discussed below
(Porter and Moore 2003). The project
consisted of a reconnaissance survey of a
47-acre tract scheduled for purchase by
HCFCD to serve as a floodplain
preservation area. Three prehistoric sites
(41HR945 to 41HR947), situated on sandy
rises or ridges were located and recorded as
subsurface lithic scatters.
One site,
41HR947, was determined not eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The
two remaining sites were recommended for
further investigations if future subsurface
disturbance would be necessary.

Also in 1996, personnel from GeoMarine, Inc., conducted survey, backhoe
trenching,
and
geoarcheological
investigations in two areas of the Cypress
Creek floodplain in northern Harris County
(Ensor et al. 1996). These investigations
were carried out at the request of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers prior to the
commencement of channel improvements
and drainage basin construction. Prehistoric
sites 41HR789 and 41HR790, described as
extremely low-density, shallow lithic artifact
scatters, were recorded. Neither site was
deemed eligible for SAL or NRHP
designation.
A survey was conducted by
personnel from Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., in 1996 on a 43-acre parcel
approximately 1.2 kilometers upstream
(west) of the juncture of Cypress Creek and
Faulkey Gully (Moore et al.1996). The tract
was the location of a proposed floodwater
detention basin. The investigation recorded
thirteen previously unknown archeological
sites, twelve prehistoric sites and one
prehistoric site with a surface historic
component (41HR774 to 41HR786). Sites
ranged from sparse lithic scatters on large
sandy rises to sizable, full-function
campsites on broad levee ridges. Lithic and
ceramic samples from the sites indicate
occupation(s) during the Late Prehistoric
and possibly a second occupation or series
of occupations dating to as early as the
Middle Archaic. The historic component at
41HR783 appears to be structural remains

In February and March of 2003,
personnel from Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an archeological
survey of a 129-acre floodplain preservation
area in northwestern Harris County along
Cypress Creek near its juncture with
Faulkey Gully (Porter 2003). A total of 406
shovel tests were dug in an attempt to locate
sites and define site boundaries. Twenty new
sites were found but three previously
recorded sites could not be relocated. Site
density was calculated at one site for every
6.5 acres surveyed or 0.16 sites per acre.
One site was deemed ineligible as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) while the
eligibility of the other sites could not be
determined due to the reconnaissance nature
of the survey.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
These classes of cemetery-associated
materials both tend to be numerous and
found close to the ground surface, and can
sometimes be located by small, shallow
shovel tests without fear of disturbing any
burials. While the presence of a shallow
drainage ditch in existing the ROW
precludes the utility of shovel testing, these
artifacts and materials may likewise be
observed via the mechanically assisted
survey method utilized during the field
efforts.

The fieldwork was conducted on
June 23, 2009, and consisted of backhoe
trenching and visual examination for surface
exposure of cultural materials (Figures 1, 2).
The project area is depicted on the
Rose Hill and Tomball, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 2).
The narrow, linear area of investigation is
confined to within the Right-of-Way, Limits
of Work for the road improvement as
depicted on Figure 3, an area approximately
130 ft. long by 10 ft. wide (ca. 40 x 3 m).
This linear ROW area was approximately
75-ft from Meyer Cemetery at their closest
approach (Figure 4). The Limits of Work
was investigated in a manner consistent with
the methodology described in the Scope of
Work for the project: a single trench about
3-4-ft wide was excavated in the ROW on
the Meyer Cemetery side of Spring-Cypress
Road (Figure 5).

However, for the current project, it
was determined that the project objective, to
definitively determine the presence or
absence of burials within the ROW, could
best be achieved by mechanical excavation
of a trench within the proposed ROW
alignment as it passes through the tract near
Meyer Cemetery.
The standard burial
identification subsurface survey procedure
entails the removal of a superficial layer of
disturbed soil in order to permit the
identification and recording of grave shaft
locations (if any) within the surrounding,
undisturbed natural soil. This technique can
generally be carried out with negligible
impact to the actual graves and human
remains.

Burial Location: Surface and SubSurface Survey Methodologies
The most basic burial and cemetery
location method is close observation of the
ground surface.
This method is
inappropriate for the Spring-Cypress
improvements due to the absence of
headstones and the slight alteration of the
improvement
alignment
during
the
construction of the existing roadway.
However, surface observation can be
supplemented by several other methods
replying on shallowly buried objects or
deposits. Toppled and buried grave markers
are the most obvious of such potential
shallowly buried artifacts. However, other
artifacts or imported objects are often placed
intentionally at cemetery locations, or tend
to be lost or discarded in some considerable
numbers within cemeteries over time.
Intentionally placed items include the grave
decorations, but may encompass materials
like crushed shell or gravel for walkways).
Lost or discarded items can include nails,
pieces of pottery, food bones, and other
everyday items left by visitors to the graves.

MAC has successfully employed
this procedure in a number of investigations
within the past fifteen years. In three
instances,
one
conducted
for
the
Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris
County, one for the City of Houston Public
Works Department, and the last for a private
developer, MAC was able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the clients and the Texas
Historical Commission that no graves were
present within the areas of concern. The
methodology was equally successful in the
remaining cases including, for example,
work conducted at the City of Houstonâs E.
R. and Ann Taylor Park, for the Harris
County Flood Control District and for the
American General Land Development
Company at its Greatwood planned

community, though the results contrasted
with the negative outcomes cited above.
Each of these investigations resulted in the
identification of numerous, previously
undocumented burials. Further, all of these
burial locations were identified without
impact to human remains or burial
enclosures (coffins, vaults, etc.).

Initial excavations encountered
disturbed soils, cables, and pipes from
previously buried utility line construction.
However, after the trench was shifted
northward towards the private property line
to avoid these disturbed areas, it revealed a
general stratigraphic sequence consisting of
a truncated 20-50 cm thick layer of very pale
brown (10yr7/3) sandy loam underlain by a
light gray (10yr7/1) clay with red (2.5yr4/3)
clay mottling (Figure 7). This clay subsoil
extended to the base of the trench at a depth
of 1.2 m below the undisturbed surface of
the adjacent private property.

Backhoe Trench Excavation
For the current project, MAC
conducted the systematic mechanical
excavation of a single 25 m long trench
within the ROW (Figure 6). The excavated
trench was placed in the portion of the
Limits of Work area closest to the marked
cemetery grounds, and it paralleled the edge
of the paved road on one side, and the edge
of the private property line on the opposing
side.
The ROW currently exhibits a
drainage ditch whose sloping shoulders
occupy most of the area of the ROW. The
center line of the trench was displaced
slightly away from the centerline of the

No evidence of grave shafts, or any
related cemetery/historic features or
materials were identified in the backhoe
trench, or during ground surface inspections
of the ROW.

both surface and subsurface (backhoe
trench) examination. A single, 25 m long
backhoe trench was excavated. After some
shifting of the excavations to avoid areas of
utility construction, the trench revealed
undisturbed soils consisting of a truncated,
ca. 20-cm thick layer of gray-brown sandy
loam underlain by mottled gray-brown and
reddish-brown clays to the base of the trench
at about 1.2 m below the undisturbed surface
of the adjacent private property.

On June 23, 2009, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted cultural resource
investigations along the north side of
Spring-Cypress Road, in northern Harris
County, Texas (Figures 1, 2).
The
investigations (MAC PN 09-27) were
conducted for The Harris County Public
Infrastructure Department under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5305.
The project area lies close to the
historic Meyer Cemetery. Harris County
was aware of the new Archeology Division
regulations in regard to ground disturbance
in proximity to recorded cemeteries, as well
as the occasional occurrence of unmarked
graves outside the currently visible
boundaries of such cemeteries. The County
therefore requested a proposal to determine
with a justifiably high level of confidence
whether or not human burials are present
within the narrow, existing Right-of-Way
(ROW) alignment within which almost all
project construction will be confined (the
possible exception is at the location of the
entry drive to the tract containing the
cemetery, where slight grading may extend
beyond the County ROW). This project was
tailored to that objective, as well as to
assessing the presence or absence of any
other class of significant archeological
deposits within the subject property.

No trace of grave shaft stains or
other evidence suggesting the presence of
human burials was found by this trench that
sampled a large proportion of the proposed
Limits of Work. The Limits of Work was
further demonstrated to have been disturbed
by considerable prior utility excavation and
construction. We are confident that there
are no human burials or other archeological
deposits of significance present within the
ROW area. We recommend that no further
archeological investigations be conducted
prior to project construction in this zone.
In the event that additional
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

A mechanized subsurface survey of
the project area was conducted, and included
