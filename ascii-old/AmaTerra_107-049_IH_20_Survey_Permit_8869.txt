Abstract
On behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation, AmaTerra Environmental conducted an
archeological survey for the proposed road expansion along Interstate Highway (IH) 20 from Lawson
Road to east of County Road (CR) 138 (Wilson Road), in Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas. The
project was completed in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit no. 8869. Work was conducted
May 2–24, 2019 by a team of five archeologists and consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian
survey and backhoe trenching within select locations of the project APE, resulting in the excavation
of 474 shovel tests and 11 backhoe trenches. Fourteen high probability units were selected for
survey within the 20.39-mile corridor. Four new archeological sites were recorded Sites 41KF183,
41KF184, 41KF185 and 41KF186. None of these sites are recommended for further work within
the APE and are also recommended not eligible for listing to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or as a State Antiquities Landmark.
In addition to the four newly identified sites, five previously recorded sites were revisited and two
Isolated Finds (IF1 and IF2) were recorded. The revisited sites, IFs and newly recorded sites have no
data potential within the APE and therefore are recommended for no further work to complete
Section 106 and ACT requirements. The survey team found most of the project area to be heavily
impacted by development and roadway disturbance. This report recommends that further work is
warranted for Unit 2, along the East Fork Trinity River, prior to construction to assess its potential
for buried archaeological deposits, as this section of the APE was entirely inundated by continuous
rain and flooding at the time of survey. No artifacts were collected as part of this project. All notes
and field records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Project Description and Impacts:

Proposed Facility
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing improvements to Interstate Highway (IH) 20
from Lawson Road to east of County Road (CR) 138 (Wilson Road), in Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas
(CSJs: 0095-13-038, 0095-14-027 and 0495-01-071) (Figures 1 and 2). The project length is approximately
20.39 miles long. The purpose of the proposed project is to improve mobility, accommodate future traffic
demand, enhance access, and improve safety along IH 20 between Lawson Road and CR 138.
Within the project limits, existing IH 20 has four to six, 12-foot wide main-lanes (two to three lanes in each
direction) with 4 to 6-foot wide inside shoulders and 10-foot wide outside shoulders, separated by a 40–82foot wide grassy median. There are no frontage roads, bike lanes, or sidewalks within most of the project
limits, as the existing frontage road ends just east of Lawson Road. The existing right-of-way (ROW) in the
project area varies from 375 to 550 feet in width and totals approximately 1,280 acres.
The proposed improvements to IH 20 would add continuous one-way frontage roads in both the eastbound
and westbound directions from Lawson Road to CR 138 (Wilson Road). The frontage roads would consist of
a 12-foot wide inside lane, a 14-foot wide shared outside lane, a 4-foot wide inside shoulder and a 2-foot
wide outside shoulder. A minimum 5-foot wide sidewalk would be included along the eastbound and
westbound frontage roads behind the back of curb. Proposed auxiliary lanes on the main-lanes would be 12
feet wide. The proposed project would also include the reconstruction of the main-lanes to accommodate
cross street improvements, and the construction, relocation, or modification of 43 ramps.
The project is being funded with federal transportation dollars provided by the U.S. Federal Highways
Administration (FHWA) and will take place on ROW owned or to be acquired by TxDOT. Therefore, Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) apply.

Area of Potential Effects (APE):
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the archeological resources is defined as the footprint of the proposed
project to the maximum depth of impact, including all easements, and project specific locations. Thus, the
APE for archeological resources will cover a total distance of approximately 20.39 miles and encompasses
approximately 1,280 acres of existing ROW, 121.5 acres of proposed new ROW and 3.8 acres of drainage
easements. The maximum depth of impacts would be approximately 20–40 feet.

Horizontal limits: from Lawson Road to east of County Road (CR) 138 (Wilson Road)
Typical width of any existing ROW (if variable, provide upper and lower limits): 375–550 feet
Typical width of entire ROW, including existing and proposed new ROW (if variable, provide upper
and lower limits): 300 feet
Typical depth of impacts: two feet
Maximum depth of impacts: 20–40 feet
No Survey Area: Unit 2
Unsurveyed area with Right-of Entry Granted: There is only one area within the APE which could not
be accessed during the May 2019 field survey of the APE. This area is designated as Unit 2 and
encompasses the area surrounding the East Fork Trinity River. Throughout the field survey, heavy
rains and resultant flooding inundated this entire Unit selected for both shovel test survey and
backhoe trenching. According to PALM maps generated for the APE (Figure 3), this is one of the
highest probability areas for finding shallow and deeply buried, pre-contact, archaeological sites.
Unit 2 was revisited several times throughout the 24-day field survey period, and no substantive
subsurface testing could be conducted either via shovel testing or backhoe trenching. It is
recommended that this Unit be surveyed at a later date when the flooding has subsided, and both
shovel testing and backhoe trenching can be conducted.

Access Denied Area: Surveyors had access to
the entire APE within the selected units
outlined for survey.
Survey Area:
The project limits were surveyed under Permit
8869 and a total of approximately 655.4 acres
were surveyed. A background study previously
determined that unsurveyed areas have low
potential for intact archeological deposits of
any age. Selected Units for survey and
backhoe trenching are presented in Table 1
and shown in Appendix A.
Some portions, particularly within Unit 2, of
the APE have potential for intact archeological
remains which were not surveyed. The actual
area surveyed was 655.4 acres, however,
85.06 acres of Unit 2 was not accessible due
to inundation.

Parcel Number(s): The survey area includes parcels 1–18, and 21–43.
Project Area Ownership: Public (TxDOT) ROW and private ownership.

Project Setting
▪

Natural Setting

Topography: The APE runs roughly west to east across the gently sloping terrain of these
dissected uplands, with several drainages, major and minor waterways crossing the APE at
several locations. Elevation ranges from a maximum of 448 feet above mean sea level (amsl)
near the western terminus of the APE, to a low of about 490 feet amsl a few miles east of the
town of Terrell.
Geology: Geologically, the project area is characterized by Cretaceous-age sands and marls,
Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits, and Holocene alluvium (USGS 1987; Figure 4). According
to the United States Department of Agriculture – Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDANRCS) Web Soil Survey (2019), soils within the APE consist of silty clays, sandy loams, silty clays,
clay loams, loams, and clays (Table 2; Figures 5a-c)

Figure 4. Project area showing underlying geology.

.
Soils These soils are derived from Pleistocene, Cretaceous, Quaternary and Holocene-age clayey
and loamy alluviums, and loamy and clayey residuums. These soils are typically deep and have
potential to contain buried archeological deposits.

Potential Archeological Liability Map: The Dallas District Potential Archeological Liability Map
(PALM) shows the APE falling within numerous zones of potential (see Figure 3a–3c). These
include Unit 1 (low potential), Units 2/3 (low shallow potential, moderate to high deep potential),
Units 4/5 (moderate potential), and Unit 9 (high potential). Potential for buried archeological

deposits varies across the APE with the most potential occurring around water crossings
including the East Fork Trinity River, Mustang Creek, Big Brushy Creek, Bachelor Creek, and
Eagans Creek.
Vegetation: The project location falls within the Northern Blackland Prairie sub-region of the
Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2009; Stahl and McElvaney 2012).
Historically, this level to gently sloping ecoregion was distinguished by its tallgrass prairie. Grass
species such as little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, tall dropseed, and eastern
Gama grass were the dominant vegetation. Some places were also forested, especially in
riparian areas. Common tree species included bur oak, Shumard oak, sugar hackberry, elm, ash,
eastern cottonwood, and pecan.
Estimated Ground Surface Visibility: 0–20 percent
▪ Human Environment
Historic Land Use: Euro-American settlement in the area, which is now Dallas and Kaufman counties,
began in the 1840s (Hart 2016; Maxwell 2016). The regional economy was founded on agricultural
pursuits including farming cotton, corn, grains, and raising stock. Although enslaved blacks were
brought into the region, slavery was not as common in Dallas and Kaufman counties as elsewhere
in Texas. The counties retained their rural nature and economic base into the 1920s and 1930s,
though manufacturing began to play a role in the economy in the late nineteenth century (Hart 2016;
Maxwell 2016). Industrialization before and after World War II meant manufacturing outpaced
agriculture in contributions to the local economies, particularly in Dallas County. Suburban
development has become a major feature of the project area due to expansion of Dallas and
surrounding communities in the later part of the twentieth century.
The project area consisted of agricultural land and ranches for much of its history. Highway maps
from 1936 and 1939 depict scattered rural and/or residential development in and around the APE
(Figure 6a-6b). Aerial photographs from 1953 show the APE as being largely rural in nature with
scattered farmsteads and clusters of houses and other structures along major roadways (Figure 7a7g). Most of the suburban residential development around the project area occurred in the latter
half of the twentieth century.

Current Land Use: Currently, properties flanking the project area are primarily rural in nature with
patches of residential development. Disturbances within the APE include artificially raised, graded
and levelled surfaces, paving, drainage ditches and culverts, and buried utilities and utility poles.
Previous Investigations and Known Archeological Sites: Background research for this project
consisted of an online records search through the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas 2019) and a review of historical maps and aerial photographs. Research focused
on the identification of archeological sites: sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs); sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), Historical Markers, cemeteries; and previously conducted archeological surveys within 0.62
mile (one kilometer) of the APE (Figure 8). The search identified 33 archeological sites, 24 previously
conducted surveys, two historic markers, and six cemeteries within a kilometer of the APE.
Of the 24 surveys identified within a kilometer of the APE, 14 overlap with the APE (Table 3). Even
though over half of the surveys overlap the APE, approximately 70 percent of the project area had
not been previously surveyed.

In addition, six cemeteries are located within a kilometer of the APE: the Haught Store Cemetery (DL-C202),
Potter Cemetery (DL-C203), Lumley Cemetery (DL-C204), Newton Family Cemetery (KF-C014), Shipley Cemetery
(KF- C034), and Antioch Cemetery (KF-C035). Of these, the Potter Cemetery is the only one that overlaps with
the APE.
The Potter Cemetery also has a historic marker (#14727) which was placed in 2005. The second historic marker
within a kilometer of the APE is for the St. John Catholic Church (#8551), which was placed in 1972. St. John
Catholic Church, established in 1876, is the oldest church site in Terrell. Neither historic marker will be impacted
by the proposed project.

Evaluation of Project Setting: APE consists of a paved, four- to six-lane highway with numerous
frontage roads, and a highly terraformed landscape. A few scattered residences and structures,
mostly on the side roads and easements, are located in the survey area. The APE is flanked by
highly developed, commercial areas in some locations, and bordered by primarily fallow pasture
and agricultural land. These
activities and improvements
have impacted the surface
throughout. (Figures 9 and
10). Overall, disturbances
within the APE were extensive,
and the potential for intact
archaeological deposits and
historic sites were extremely
poor, even in areas previously
determined to be highprobability
within
the
proposed, new ROW.

Survey Methods
▪

Surveyors: Maura Hogan (PI/PM) Garrett Wheaton (Crew Chief), Sarah Southern, Alexis
Goodwill, Hanna Pageau

Description of Methods: Survey efforts involved visual inspection supplemented with excavation of
474 shovel tests (Appendix B and C). Shovel testing occurred within 14 high probability units. Tests
were excavated in all undisturbed areas of the APE and were dug to shale bedrock, compacted
clays, or water table, whichever was encountered first. The average shovel test terminated 30–40
cmbs. All tests were marked using a hand-held GPS unit and logged on standardized forms that
recorded profile characteristics, depth, and contents. Shovel test spacing followed the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) minimum standards for linear surveys of one test every 100 meters
except where roadways, drainage and culvert improvements, utilities or flooded areas precluded
the need for shovel testing. Access was available for all Units surveyed, as well as for the additional
areas of the southwestern section of the APE which received a judgmental survey transect.
Therefore, the actual distance surveyed equaled about 15 miles.
Additional shovel tests were excavated at site areas to delineate boundaries and assess depth and
integrity of deposits. Although CTA standards recommend six tests to delineate sites, extreme
variability in surface visibility, disturbance due to roadway construction, and limitation to available
landforms for shovel testing required modifications in methodology to define site limits in each case
of both revisited sites and newly identified sites. Individual site delineation needs are discussed
along with the site descriptions.

Archeological Survey of IH 20, Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas

26

Materials such as modern glass, unidentifiable or modern metal, plastic and Styrofoam were
encountered in the upper 10 cm of some shovel tests and were noted but not considered positive
for archaeological materials, and no thus bounding was employed. All positive shovel tests and
features were bounded in cruciform, wherever possible, at intervals appropriate for the size of the
sites until two, consecutive negative shovel tests were excavated at 5-m intervals, until ROW limits
were reached or until other natural or man-made impediments to testing was encountered.
During the survey, investigators took photographs of the landscape, sites, features, and various
disturbances encountered. Additionally, site notes and maps were made in the field, and artifacts
were documented photographically.

Other Methods: None

Collection and Curation:

▪

Comments on Methods: The methods used during the survey exceed the Council of Texas
Archeologist (CTA) standards, which call for one shovel test every 100 meters (16 per mile) for
linear projects. Subsurface test rate for this project equals 0.72 shovel tests per acre. The linear
spacing equaled about 31.6 per mile. This exceeds the CTA’s minimum standards for both linear
and area surveys. All subsurface tests were spaced approximately 100 meters apart, except
where conditions prevented or obviated the need for excavation of shovel tests. In site areas
with buried deposits, additional shovel tests were excavated to define site limits horizontally
and vertically, as well as characterize and assess content. Due to the extremely wet conditions
during field survey, an additional portion of the APE was surveyed at 100 m intervals on the
south side of IH 20. This area was determined to offer the best landforms and higher probability
for containing intact buried deposits, given the level of saturation within Unit 2 and for the
majority of the APE when field crews first arrived on the project area. The judgmental shovel
testing is shown in survey map (see Appendix B). While surveying this area chosen by the
Principle Investigator joining field crews for the survey, IF1 was discovered, a surface find of
one, complete lithic flake.

▪

Survey Area Description: The archeological survey occurred between May 2 and May 24, 2019
and was completed using a four-person crew. The project crosses 20.39 miles of IH 20 and
associated easements and included several areas of commercial and residential development
within the APE. Topography is flat to gently rolling. Most of the drainages crossed during the
survey are extremely flooded, in addition to the major and minor tributaries of the Trinity River
at the time of fieldwork.

Site Revisits:
41DL265:
The site (aka “Falcon’s Lair”) was originally recorded in 1985 by Nathan D. Maier Consulting Engineers
and was identified as a multi-component site consisting of a ca. late nineteenth to early twentieth
century artifact scatter with one brick-lined well and a pre-contact, open, buried lithic scatter of

metaquartzite and chert flakes. A 1900 Dallas County map shows a structure in this location along
road. Currently, this site is located approximately 65 m north of the survey ROW limits, under the
existing parking lot for a recently constructed Texas A&M facility. Three, negative shovel tests were
excavated at the top of a ridge, within the ROW, overlooking the location of the site centroid. Site
visibility was less than five percent, with ground cover of mixed grasses, dropseed, and various
species of wildflowers. Soils were a 10YR 2/1 black clay loam to 50 cmbs.

This site was originally recorded in 2002 by AR Consultants, identified as a pre-contact lithic quarry.
The current location of the site centroid is in passing lane of IH20 Eastbound. Due to heavily impacted
soils, terraformed landscape, and hazardous survey conditions, this site was observed, photodocumented, and no shovel testing was performed.
41DL500:
This site was originally recorded in 2010 by AR Consultants, identified as a pre-contact surface
artifact scatter of lithic flakes, cores and fire-cracked-rock (FCR). The right of way (ROW) for this
survey is directly adjacent to the polygon for the previously recorded site, and testing along the
northwest corner of the established site boundary was conducted, in order to confirm existing site
boundaries. Four negative tests within ROW along east side of Lawson Road were excavated, as this
was the only available ground surface suitable for subsurface testing. This area has been heavily
disturbed by recent roadway construction, and testing location is situated on a gentle five to eight
percent toe slope of a low terrace rising to the north. Surface inspection at one m-intervals did not
identify any surface artifacts. Surface visibility was approximately 25 percent within run-off channels,
and less than five percent within the fallow, mixed-grass field located less than 10 m east of the edge
of Lawson Road. Gravel fill, safety glass, plastic and modern glass bottles were observed across the
site surface. Soils consisted of a 10 YR 2/1 compact black clay from 0-40 cmbs.
41KF37:
This site was original identified in 1940 by Fred Wendorf, prior to the construction of IH-20. Also
known as Wendorf Site #11, little is recorded about the site, nor is the site location precise. Centroid
coordinates are assumed to be approximate, based upon Wendorf’s description of the site location
according to a hand-plot on a contemporaneous Bound County Highway Map. At present, the site
centroid lies almost directly in the center of the frontage road. Two pre-contact sinkers of unknown
affiliation are recorded as artifacts associated with the site. The site location was revisited during
the survey, and field staff observed that this entire area has been heavily disturbed by recent
construction and the construction of an asphalt frontage road. Available shovel test locations were
limited by the construction, paved road, and edge of the ROW for the survey project. Three negative
shovel tests were excavated at five m-intervals to the north and south of frontage road, and no surface
artifacts were observed. Surface visibility was approximately five percent on either side of the
roadway, populated by mixed grasses, little bluestem, and various wildflower species, and on the
sides of the roadway visibility was 90 percent. Soils are a 10 YR 4/4 yellowish brown sandy clay that
is likely construction fill brought in during road and berm construction.

41KF130:
This site was originally recorded in 2005 by AR Consultants, and identified as an old historic house
site comprised of one corrugated metal shed structure, one collapsed brick and concrete cistern in
the southwest corner of the site, as well as another cistern (well) approximately three ft in diameter
in the center east of the site. Also noted was a metal grid fence with railroad tie posts. No subsurface
testing was conducted during the 2005 pipeline survey.
AmaTerra field staff located the 41KF130 site datum within the APE, approximately 20 meters south
of the fence line described as the southern site boundary in the original 2005 survey (Figure 11).
Cruciform shovel testing was conducted at this location in order to determine the presence of intact,
cultural deposits associated with the site that may be impacted by the proposed IH 20 roadway
improvements. During the site revisit survey a total of eighteen shovel tests at 10 m- to 5m- intervals
were excavated within the project APE. Eleven of these shovel tests were positive, yielding domestic
and architectural artifacts dating from the early 1900’s through the 1980’s at depths from 0 to 35
cm below surface (see Table 5 and artifact summary below). Field staff also relocated the smaller,
three-foot diameter cistern/well feature on the northern border of the ROW. The well is constructed
of laid brick and concrete but is currently submerged by flood waters and in very poor condition.

positive shovel tests.

In the area where the larger, brick and concrete cistern should have been located, there has been
recent construction activity, and the cistern appears to have been destroyed by bulldozing, a deep
excavation for pipeline repairs and the deposition of a 30-m wide push pile of disturbed soils (Figure
12). The construction activity spans the western terrace edge within the ROW, and several fragments
of handmade brick and concrete were observed scattered across the freshly bulldozed ground as well
as within the wall of the excavation pit. Given the extent of this disturbance, subsurface testing did
not continue beyond this construction zone and thus it comprises the newly established, western site
boundary for 41KF130. The site revisit shovel testing was constricted to the north by the edge of the
ROW and to the south and east by a 25–35 per cent slope along the contour of the terrace upon
which the site is situated. Shovel testing recovered cultural materials likely associated with the main
site across an area measuring approximately 70 m east-west by 40 m north-south, thus expanding
the site boundaries originally recorded to include an additional area of approximately 1,900 square
meters (approximately 20,500 square feet).

Figure 12. View of extensive disturbance along western boundary of Site KF130, showing excavation pit for
pipeline repairs and push piles from construction, Facing south west.

The primary historic house site is clearly visible just north of the project area ROW. A small,
approximately 7-ft wide by 10-ft long corrugated metal shed was noted approximately 20 m northnortheast of the small well relocated during the revisit survey (Figure 13). A second, much larger
corrugated metal structure was observed approximately 45 m north of the ROW at the western end

Archeological Survey of IH 20, Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas

of the revisit survey area, this structure is estimated to measure 30 ft long by 20 ft wide and 25 ft in
height. A woven wire fence was observed within the vicinity of the structure as well.
A total of 50 historic artifacts were recovered from positive shovel tests, dating primarily to the mid1900’s, as well as a small number of artifacts dating to the 1920s–1940s, ca. pre-WWII. This was a
no collection survey, and all artifacts were recorded, photographed, and then re-buried in their
associated shovel test. Artifacts included amethyst glass, light blue glass, stoneware and
architectural materials such as handmade brick. Soils across the majority of the site are
characterized as a saturated, 10 YR 2/1 black silty clay from 0–40 cm below surface (cmbs), and a
10 YR 4/1 dark gray compact with caliche nodules from 40–65 cmbs. Shovel tests located closer to
the construction area had between 20 to 30 per cent gravel inclusions. Artifact density was moderate
across the revisited site area, with the highest density concentrated near the well feature and the
northwest corner, which was closest to the main house site and the destroyed cistern. Surface
visibility was less than five percent, with thick ground cover of prairie grasses and various wildflower
species.

With respect to site integrity, the portion of the site within the ROW is comprised entirely of historic
artifact fragments in shallow subsurface contexts and is estimated to be less than 15 percent intact.
The artifacts are likely associated with a ca. early to mid- 20th century homestead, of which the main
occupation area and intact structures are located outside of the ROW and, therefore, will not be
impacted by the proposed road improvements. The artifacts are not a unique representation of
similar-aged sites, and the portion of the site which lies within the ROW has clearly been heavily
impacted by recent and historic construction and roadway improvement activities. While 1953 aerials
of the site location do show structures in the same locations as the corrugated metal shed and house
are located currently, there is no indication of a significant occupation area in the portion of the site
where shovel testing was conducted. The expanded site area is not considered a significant resource
for future research, and therefore is considered not eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion D.
Newly Identified Archaeological Sites
41KF183
This is an early 20th-century historic artifact surface scatter in an agricultural field, with diagnostic
artifacts dating primarily to the 1920s through early 1940s (Pre-WWII) (Figure 14). The site is located
10 to 15 m south of the IH 20 frontage road, extending for a length of 565 meters (1,845 ft) westnorthwest from the intersection of the frontage road and FM 3932. Ground surface visibility was 100
percent.

Archeological Survey of IH 20, Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas

An estimated 150 historic glass, metal and ceramic artifacts associated with the site were observed
on the ground surface of a plowed field planted with rows of young soybeans. The topography within
the boundaries of the site is characterized as a wide upland terrace with a gentle, five to eight percent
slope to the east. The agricultural field follows the contour of the IH 20 frontage road to the north,
which intersects with FM 2932 at the IH 20 exit overpass at the northeast extent of the site (Figure
15). A sample of the diagnostic surface artifacts (SA) were plotted across the site with a hand-held
GPS unit. Diagnostics included such artifacts as amethyst glass, hand-wrought farm and ranch tools,
architectural materials, a milk glass button, an milk glass jar lid insert, a copper shot gun cap and
various ceramics such as a molded, scalloped white ware rim fragment and a white ware base fragment
with a Crown Potteries Co. makers mark (ca. 1902-1933). Individual and clusters of these diagnostic
artifacts as SA01 through SA13. Ten negative shovel tests were excavated across the site, with double
negative shovel tests excavated at the southeastern and northwestern extents of the site. Soils are
characterized as a saturated, 10 YR 2/1 black loamy clay from 0-70 cm below surface (cmbs), at which
depth the clay became extremely compact. The surface artifacts are concentrated in two separate
areas within the site, and several more were observed but not marked to the south and west of where
the edge of the ROW was located comprising the southern boundary of the site. Surface artifacts have
been displaced by active plowing and planting within the agricultural field across an area of at least
17,215 square meters (185,280 square ft) with no point of origin observable. The northern extent of
the site has been truncated by ditch and embankment construction associated with the frontage road
system, with berm slopes of up to 30 percent along the frontage road, followed by slopes of 45 percent
to 90 percent leading down to IH 20E roughly 60 m (190 ft) to the north. The western portion of the
site is bounded by two negative shovel tests, excavated within the planted rows, and no surface
artifacts were observed further west of this boundary. To the east, the site is also bounded by two
negative shovel tests, and no surface artifacts were observed beyond this eastern boundary. To the
south, the site boundary extends to and along the edge of the ROW. The dimensions of the site are:
approximately 565 meters (1,845 ft) west northwest in length and approximately 75 meters (245 ft)
wide at the largest east-west extent within the ROW; total site area is approximately 17,215 sq meters
(185,280 sq ft).

A total of 24 diagnostic, historic artifacts have been recorded as Surface Artifacts at the site, all are
dated primarily to the 1920s-1940s, ca. pre-WWII (Table 6 and Figure 16). This was a "no pick-up"
survey, and all artifacts were recorded and then left in situ on the ground surface. An itemized list of

With respect to site integrity, this site is comprised entirely of historic surface artifact fragments in a
plowed agricultural field, with no above ground structures, and is estimated to be less than ten per
cent intact. The artifacts are likely associated with a ca. 1920 to 1940’s homestead or farmstead, the
main occupation area and structure having been destroyed over fifty years ago. A review of records at
held at the Kaufman County Appraisal District Office and the County Clerk shows that the current owner
of the property is listed as The J. Moore Griffin Farm (Vol. 4262, pg. 553), with the deed grantee named
as Carolyn West (Vol. 1636, pg. 43). The north eastern-most section of this parcel, where the majority
of artifacts were recorded, was sold to the State of Texas in 1981, in advance of the construction of IH
20. The last warranty deed on record for this parcel (Parcel ID 54189) lists Gordon T. West as the
grantor of the property in 1975. No further information could be recovered on chain-of-title records,
however, a review of the 1953 historic aerial of this site shows that the land was in use for agricultural
cultivation as early as this.
These artifacts are not a unique representation of similar-aged sites, and no persons of significance
were identified in association with the property during deed research. The site is not considered a
significant resource for future research, and therefore is considered not eligible for NRHP listing under
Criterion D.

41KF184:
This is an early 20th-century, subsurface artifact scatter located within a median between IH 20
Eastbound and a frontage road, with diagnostic artifacts dating primarily to the 1920s through early
1940s (Pre-WWII) (Figure 17). The site occupies the majority of the grassy median, with IH 20 forming
the northern boundary of the site and the frontage road (serving as the southern site boundary,
extending for a length of approximately 215 meters (710 ft) northwest from the intersection of the
frontage road and FM 304/Rosehill Road Figure 18. Ground surface visibility was less than 10
percent, with a thick vegetation cover of prairie grass, winecup, primrose, Indian blanket and various
other wildflower species. The total site dimensions are estimated as 155 m (510 ft) northeastsouthwest in widest dimension and 215 m (710 ft) northwest-southeast in longest dimension, with a
total area of approximately 20,775 sq. m (223,660 sq. ft).

Figure 18. General overview of environment from south east boundary of site 41KF184, facing west.

The topography within the boundaries of the site is characterized as a wide upland plateau with a
gentle, five percent slope to the east. Current land use of the areas as a highway median has clearly
contributed to extensive disturbance of the site, because of both recent and historic construction and
grading activities associated with IH 20 construction and reconstruction efforts. The northern and
southern extents of the site have been truncated by ditch and embankment construction associated
with IH 20 eastbound and the off-ramp and frontage road that runs roughly parallel with IH 20 to the
south. Berm slope increased to 30 percent along the frontage road toward the south eastern corner
of the site, and the site is truncated again along the eastern boundary by a drainage ditch Figure 19
which directs runoff water from IH 20 and the frontage road system into a north-south trending
channel that extends underneath the intersection of the frontage road with FM 304/Rosehill Road.
The western portion of the site is bounded by two, consecutive negative shovel tests in a north-south
grid line from IH 20 to the frontage road. With the excavation of 12 positive shovel tests, a good
sample of the artifact types and date ranges for diagnostics that are representative of the site
assemblage was recorded, and no further testing at the site is recommended.

A total of 23 shovel tests were excavated during site delineation, with 12 of these being positive.
Initial cruciform shovel testing at 10-m intervals was initiated to bound the first positive shovel test
excavated at the site, however, field staff quickly recognized the need to greatly expand the shovel
testing intervals after several more positive shovel tests had been excavated. Shovel testing coverage
in site delineation proceeded by intervals and frequency appropriate to determine that the boundaries
of the site are, for the most part, established by roadways and associated improvements which
truncate the original, historic site extent. Only the western site boundary was established by a grid
line of two, consecutive negative shovel tests.
A total of 48 historic artifacts were recovered from positive shovel tests, dating primarily to the early
1900’s through the 1940s, ca. pre-WWII. All artifacts were recorded, photographed, and then reburied in their associated shovel test. Diagnostics included such artifacts as a “Duraglas” embossed
bottle heel, an applied color label (ACL) printed RC Cola bottle, a milk glass cosmetic jar (Figure 20),
and architectural materials. Soils across most of the site are characterized as a 10 YR 3/2very dark
grayish brown loam from 0-15 cm below surface (cmbs), and a 10 YR 5/3 brown clay mottled up to
40 percent with a 10 YR 6/6 brownish yellow, compact clay with frequent caliche nodules. All artifacts
were recovered within Horizon A soils, and the mottled clays are clearly the intact, sterile soils
underlying the occupation period for the site, and, in combination with observations of soil profiles
across the project area, indicate that these Horizon B soils at the site and within the surrounding area
pre-date any historic or pre-contact occupation. Artifact density was moderate across the site. No
surface artifacts and no above-ground features were observed during survey of the site.

With respect to site integrity, this site is comprised entirely of historic artifact recovered from shallow
subsurface contexts and is estimated to be less than 20% intact. A review of the 1939 Kaufman and
1936 Dallas County Roadway Map (see Figure 6) shows the presence of a structure in the parcel just
south of the location of the site (Parcel ID 7654), and 1953 USGS aerial also shows the presence of a
structure and a possible agricultural field in this location (see Figure 7). The artifacts are likely
associated with a ca. early to mid- 20th century homestead or farmstead, the main occupation area
and structure having been destroyed. A review of records at held at the Kaufman County Appraisal
District Office and the County Clerk shows that the current owner of the parcel adjacent to the site is
listed as J. C. Hale (Vol. 5726, pg. 52), with the deed grantor named Robbie Lee Hale in 2005 (Vol.
2788, pg. 148). The portion of the parcel where the site has been located is currently owned by the
State of Texas, the Hale family having sold several tracts within the parcel to the state prior to the
construction of IH 20 in 1981. Over the course of the last half-century, the parcel had been divided
into many tracts as family heirs and relatives became the grantees, however, deed research and
examination of historic plat maps held at the Appraisal District Office allowed for finer precision in
tracing ownership of the specific tract upon which the site is situated. In 1974, William R. Williams
was the grantee of the warranty deed for the tract (Vol. 596, pg. 863). Prior to this, Maggie Johnson is
listed as the grantee of the tract in 1947 (Vol. 243, pg. 44), with the grantor listed as Lillie and George
Baxter. Mr. and Mrs. Baxter are still listed as the property owner on a 1936 deed record (no. 1662),
and historic plat maps show G. Baxter as the landowner in 1920. No further information could be
recovered on chain-of-title records.
These artifacts are not a unique representation of similar-aged sites, and no persons of significance
were identified in association with the property during deed research. The site is not considered a
significant resource for future research, and therefore is considered not eligible for NRHP listing under
Criterion D.
41KF185:
This is an early to mid- 20th century, subsurface artifact scatter, with no above-ground features nor
surface artifacts observed within the testing area. Figure 21. The site occupies a narrow ridge near
the northern edge of the project ROW, with a roughly east-west trending gravel road directly south of
the edge of the ROW forming the northern boundary of the site (Figure 22). Ground surface visibility
was less than 10 percent with a thick vegetation cover of prairie grass, winecup, primrose, Indian
blanket and various other wildflower species for most of the site, and 100 percent visibility along the
gravel road forming the site’s northern boundary. The total site dimensions are estimated as 10
meters (33 ft) north-south in widest dimension and 40 m (130 ft) east-west in longest dimension; the
total site area is approximately 200 sq. meters (2,180 sq. ft).

The topography within the boundaries of the site is characterized as an upland terrace edge with a
man-made, 35 percent slope to the edge of IH 20W 20 m south of the site. The site follows the
narrow contour of an unnamed gravel road to the north, which intersects with High Country Lane at
the northeast corner of the site. The western portion of the site is bounded by two, consecutive
negative shovel tests. No further testing at the site is recommended.
A total of five shovel tests were excavated during site delineation, with three of these being positive.
Cruciform shovel testing at 10-m intervals was employed to bound all positive shovel test excavated
at the site where landform and ground conditions provided available shovel testing surfaces.
A total of 12 artifacts comprise the site assemblage and includes six diagnostic artifacts dating
primarily to the 1900s-1940s, ca. pre-WWII. All artifacts were recorded and then reburied when
shovel tests were back-filled. An itemized list of artifacts documented is provided in Table 8. All dates
were derived from BLM/SHA Historic Glass Bottle Identification & Information Website 2019; Buckles
et al. 1978; Busch 1981; nps.gov website 2019; Peres 2008; and Toulouse 1971:100.

With respect to site integrity, this site is comprised of a very low-density scatter artifact fragments in shallow subsurface
contexts and the original historic house site is estimated to be less than 10% intact.
These artifacts are not a unique representation of similar-aged sites, and no persons of significance were identified
during deed research in association with the property. The site is not considered a significant resource for future
research, and therefore is considered not eligible for NRHP listing under Criterion D.

41KF186
This is a cluster of three central features, all ca. mid-20th-century concrete, metal and PVC pipe
constructed cisterns (Figure 23). The site is located 40 meters east of an IH 20 overpass, extending
for a length of approximately 50 meters (150 ft) east-west, and is located 75 m (250 ft) northeast of
the intersection of the overpass and Rosehill Road. Ground surface visibility was less than 10 percent,
as the vegetation consisted of thick prairie grasses along the borders, where the slope to the overpass
begins to rise, and a 20 to 50 cm-thick layer of freshly-laid and steam-rolled gravel. No shovel testing
was conducted at the site, as ground surface did not permit subsurface testing.

Figure 23. Aerial map of newly recorded site 41KF186, showing site features and site boundaries.

The cisterns, Features 1, 2 and 3, are constructed of concrete with average-sized aggregate, set in
cylinders approximately seven feet tall and 53 inches in diameter (Figure 24). Feature 3 appears to
have woven wire framework protruding from the top surface and Features 1 and 2 have several PVC
pipes protruding from the side walls of the cisterns, presumably to allow water to flow out freely or at
one time to be attached to an irrigation system. A faint, 20 m (65 ft) diameter earthwork, possibly an
old water tank for cattle or livestock, is located approximately 50 feet east-northeast from the cluster
of cisterns. Some metal bracing, likely for a large barn or corral, is partially visible within the vicinity
of the cisterns. To the north and east, the site boundaries are approximated by the absence of
features and no surface artifacts were observed beyond these boundaries. To the south, the site
boundary extends to and along the edge of Rosehill Road. The dimensions of the site are:
approximately 60 meters (200 ft) north-south in length and approximately 65 meters (225 ft) wide
at the largest east-west extent within the ROW; total site area is approximately 5,750 sq. meters
(50,000 sq. ft).

With respect to site integrity, this site is estimated to be less than 10% intact. A review of the 1939
Kaufman and 1936 Dallas County Roadway Map (see Figure 6) and 1953 USGS aerial (see Figure 7)
shows the presence of a structure just south of the location of the neighboring site, 41KF184,
approximately 1,000 ft (300 m) to the west south west. The cisterns are likely associated with a ca.
mid- 20th century farmstead, and furthermore these cisterns may in fact be an extension of site
41KF184, as no accompanying structures can be located for these specific features. The features and
surrounding site area are impacted even more heavily by recent grading and gravel-dumping at the
location (Figure 25). A review of records at held at the Kaufman County Appraisal District Office and
the County Clerk shows that the current owner of the parcel adjacent to the site is listed as J. C. Hale
(Vol. 3593, pg. 485), with the deed grantor named Redden Electric in 2001 (Vol. 1841, pg. 204). The
portion of the parcel where the site has been located is currently owned by the State of Texas, sold to
the state prior to the construction of IH 20 in 1981. No further information could be recovered on
chain-of-title records.
These cisterns are not a unique representation of similar-aged sites, and no persons of significance
were identified in association with the property during deed research. The site is not considered a
significant resource for future research, and therefore is considered not eligible for NRHP listing under
Criterion D.

Isolated Finds:
IF1: This is an isolated surface find encountered during pedestrian survey of the APE between Units
2 and 3 on the southern side of IH 20. IF1 is comprised of one complete, quartzite flake of unknown
prehistoric affiliation (Figures 26 and 27). This flake was likely washed out from a small, low upland
terrace just south of the wash-out area within which it was observed. A total of eight shovel tests
were excavated in cruciform to the surface find at five m intervals; all shovel tests were negative.
Soils in this area were highly disturbed, as the topsoil had been eroded by the exposed terrace, and
much of the area appears to be displaced, compacted clay deposits with frequent degraded
limestone and shale inclusions. The disturbance of the soils is likely associated with the
construction of the asphalt road north of the surface find. Ground visibility was 90–100 percent
within the wash-out where the flake was observed. Due to erosion, most of the prairie grass
common to the rest of the APE had been thinned significantly in the shovel testing area, as well.
Soils are characterized as a 10 YR 7/1 from 0-15 cmbs, followed by a 10 YR 5/6 clay fill with
modern debris frequently encountered.

IF2: This is an isolated whiteware sherd with red spongeware decoration encountered at 0-15 cmbs
in positive shovel test AG17 (Figure 28). The sherd dates to the early 1900s to 1930s, which is a
typical date range for most historic sites encountered within the APE. Five negative shovel tests
were excavated at 5 to 10 m intervals from the positive, in an east-west transect, as the landform
directly to the south was a high, 35 percent slope — a man-made berm for IH20 eastbound — and
a drainage was located less than 10m to the north of the area where the positive was excavated.
Surface visibility was less than 10 percent, as the vegetation consisted of thick prairie grass and
various wildflower species. Soils were typically characterized as a 10 YR 2/1 compacted, black
clay, and the water table was shallow in this area. No structures or other evidence of a historic site
was observed within the vicinity.

Backhoe Trench Summary (see Appendix D):
BHT1 measured 92 centimeters wide by 356 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 240
centimeters, and an elevation of 460–470ft. The trench was located on the south side of IH20 East,
near a culvert. The topography is best described as upland alluvial, with vegetation consisting of tall
grasses, little blue stem and other mixed wildflowers. The trench was separated into four different soil
zones. While excavating the trench a much lighter 10YR 6/2 layer was encountered roughly one meter
below the ground surface. Within this layer, a piece of barbed wire was found during screening. It
became clear that this 10YR 5/6 layer was the original, historic ground surface. The loamy and silty
clays excavated during shovel testing was fill emplaced over the ground surface, likely displaced

49

wetland clays from digging out the drainage and constructing the culvert located roughly 12 meters
north of the trench. Trench excavation was terminated at the water table.
BHT2 measured 92 centimeters wide by 506 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 221
centimeters, and an elevation of 460–470ft. The trench was located 20 meters South of IH20 and
eight meters east of a creek. The topography is best described as upland alluvial, with vegetation
consisting of tall grasses, drop seed, little blue stem and other mixed wildflowers. The trench was
separated into four different soil zones. During profiling of the North wall, field staff pulled a wire nail
out of the wall at 21 centimeters. On this side of the creek, it appears as though the original ground
surface is much shallower and very little, if any, displaced alluvium from construction of the nearby
culvert was deposited here. The wire nail is an indication that land use prior to the construction of IH
20 was likely agricultural land or pasture for ranching. No other artifacts or unique aspects of the profile
were observed. Trench excavation was terminated at the water table.
BHT3 measured 84 centimeters wide by 389 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 126
centimeters, and an elevation of 460– 470ft. The trench was located 15 meters south of IH 20 and
seven meters east of Eagan’s creek on the creek terrace. The topography is best described as upland
alluvial, with vegetation consisting of tall grasses, pink primrose, Queen Anne’s lace and thistle. The
trench was separated into five different soil zones. The trench location was chosen for its proximity to
Eagan’s creek, as this appeared to be an area of high probability for encountering deeply buried
archaeological deposits. Shovel testing prior to trenching indicated this was more of a floodplain
deposit with a shallow water table. Trench excavation confirms initial observations and interpretation
of the geology. No unique characteristics of the soils were observed, nor any artifacts recovered. Trench
excavation was terminated at the water table.
BHT4 measured 92 centimeters wide by 336 centimeters long with a maximum depth of 223
centimeters, and an elevation of 460– 470ft. The trench was located on the west bank of Eagan’s
creek. The topography is best described as upland alluvial, with vegetation consisting of tall grasses,
little bluestem, dandelion, primrose, and drop seed. The trench was separated into five different soil
zones. The trench location was chosen for its proximity to Eagan’s creek. There is less development
(residential) on the west side of the creek, however, there is clear evidence of redeposited soils in the
upper 60 centimeters of the trench. This may be from construction related to IH-20, the culvert 20m
east of the trench, or it may be from habitual flooding in the area. The similarity of the first two zones
with BHT3, is indicative of redeposited soils. The bottom three zones are natural sterile levels. Trench
excavation was terminated at the water table.
BHT5 measured 77 centimeters wide by 305 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 254
centimeters, and an elevation of 460 to 470ft. The trench was located on a terrace ridge 20 meters
north of IH 20, and 15 meters higher than the interstate. The topography is best described as upland
ridge, a small natural ridge with a steep out bank about five meters south of the trench location cut to
accommodate the construction of IH 20. Vegetation consists of tall grasses, pink primrose, and drop

seed. The trench was separated into four different soil zones. The trench location was chosen for its
topographic uniqueness within the APE. There were very few natural ridges as high in elevation as this
location. The possibility of finding deeply buried archaeological deposits is higher than most other areas
within the APE. A natural ravine slope is about 300 meters to the west. No cultural materials were
discovered.
BHT6 measured 88 centimeters wide by 417 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 213
centimeters, and an elevation of 450 to 460ft. The trench was located 10 meters north of IH 20 and
60 meters south of a man-made lake; a tributary of Big Brushy Creek likely once flowed here as well.
The topography is best described as upland ridge, with vegetation consisting of tall grasses, Queen
Anne’s lace, dandelion, and drop seed. The trench was separated into three different soil zones. The
trench location was chosen based on topographic characteristics as an upland ridge with little to no
disturbance from highway construction, and its proximity to an old tributary or channel of Big Brushy
Creek. No unique characteristics of the soil or strata were observed, and no cultural materials were
discovered.
BHT7 measured 88 centimeters wide by 398 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 219
centimeters, and an elevation of 440–450ft. The trench was located 15 meters south of IH 20, and
35 meters north of a lake within 25 meters of an old tributary of Big Brushy Creek. The topography is
best described as upland ridge, with vegetation consisting of a great diversity of short and tall grasses,
Queen Anne’s lace, primrose and little bluestem. The trench was separated into three different soil
zones. The trench location was chosen for proximity to a dammed lake, and nearness to an old channel
of Big Brushy Creek. There is very little modern disturbance and the location is at the top of a small
gently sloping upland ridge. Due to recent heavy rains the soils are very saturated. No cultural materials
were discovered.
BHT8 measured 96 centimeters wide by 593 centimeters long, with a maximum depth of 300
centimeters, and an elevation of 420–430ft. The trench was located 20 meters north of IH 20, on the
West bank of Big Brushy Creek. The topography is best described as alluvial terrace, with vegetation
consisting of a tall grasses, Queen Anne’s lace, primrose, Elm and Sycamore trees, Indian blanket,
bluebonnets, and big bluestem. The trench was separated into three different soil zones (Figure 29).
The trench location was chosen for proximity to Big Brushy Creek (Figure 30). The alluvial terrace is
15–20 meters above the creek. A peninsula to the east of this major branch of the creek was
inaccessible for the backhoe, so trenching on the east side of a branch of Big Brushy Creek, about 75
meters to the east of the peninsula, was attempted, but a deep drainage impeded passage. Alluvium
is extremely deep here, and the trench was expanded approximately 300 centimeters to the west to
allow the backhoe to excavate more deeply, as soils remained relatively unchanged for over 250
centimeters deep. No cultural materials were observed.

BHT9 measured 87 centimeters wide by 364 centimeters
long, with a maximum depth of 170 centimeters, and an
elevation of 460–470ft. The trench was located 20 meters
south of IH 20, on a ridgetop. The topography is best
described as upland ridge, with vegetation consisting of a
tall grasses, Queen Anne’s lace, Indian blanket, and
bluebonnets. The trench was separated into three different
soil zones. The trench location was chosen for its high
elevation within the APE. There are some downed sycamore
trees along the ridge tip here, likely related to the clearing
of pastureland directly to the south of the trench. A barbed
wire fence runs north-south along the ridge top, and a metal
gate opens to a dirt road approximately five meters east of
the trench. Soils here are more compact and show
evidence of possible past agricultural practice. This may be
a more eroded ridgetop due to agricultural and natural
stripping of the upper strata, especially given the steeply
cut ridge-side facing IH 20. Soils were relatively shallow by
the time sterile subsoil was encountered, followed by shale
and degraded limestone inclusions.

profile and backhoe trench extension, facing east.

BHT10 measured 77 centimeters
wide by 352 centimeters long,
with a maximum depth of 188
centimeters, and an elevation of
440 to 450ft. The trench was
located 30 meters east of a creek
tributary (Big Brushy or unnamed).
The topography is best described
as a toe slope on an upland ridge,
with vegetation consisting of
mixed short and tall grasses,
bee’s balm, Indian blanket, and
dandelions. The trench was
separated into four different soil
zones. The trench location was
chosen for its topographic
characteristics, it is a toe slope of

to creek about 30 meters west of
the trench. Also, shovel test MH40 was excavated here and the soil profile indicated a favorable place
for deep trenching. The first zone, about five centimeters down, produced a modern cow humeral

fragment, which is not significant as this is pastureland immediately to the south of the trench location.
The third zone is indicative of an original historic surface; therefore, it is assumed that the first and
second zones are a product of IH 20 construction and a silty soil slump. No cultural materials found
below five centimeters below surface.
BHT11 consisted of scraping a large triangle, with a maximum depth of 45 centimeters, and an
elevation of 410–420ft. The trench was located roughly 50 meters south of the mapped boundary of
Potter Cemetery. The trench begins along the southern side of a modern fence line and continues in
an obtuse triangle (Figures 31 and 32). The topography is best described as the base of a hill, with
vegetation consisting of mixed short and tall grasses, drop seed, and wildflowers to the South, with
oak, cedar and juniper trees to the North. The trench was separated into four different soil zones.
Backhoe scraping was proposed for this area as a precaution due to the potential of unmarked graves
associated with Potter Cemetery to the north to be located within the ROW. Scraping determined that
there had been extensive prior construction activity along the fence line and further south. There are
also numerous mature juniper and cedar trees, as well as some sycamore, that line the northern
boundary of the proposed scraping area, which contributed to the mottling of soils in addition to that
caused by prior construction. In order to more accurately assess the potential presence of grave shafts,
the surface scrape was taken down to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. During scraping a utility trench
was clearly visible along the southwest corner and southern border of the proposed scrape area. Soils
to the immediate north of the utility trench consist of a mixture of silty clay (10YR 2/1) and mottled
clays (10YR 5/2 with 30 percent 10YR 6/8), likely slump and excavated soils from the utility trenching.
An open pasture upslope to the north also likely contributed a good deal of topsoil slump. Along the
southern border of the area exists a high, built-up berm, and a drainage ditch, Between the built-up
berm and the depth of the ditch, the slope is 35–40 percent. Just north of this berm and just south of
the backhoe scraping area, a clear linear deposit of 10YR 6/4 sandy loam has been laid down over the
emplaced utility line defining Zone 3. Zone 1 consists of 10YR 2/1 silty clay, that is likely runoff from
the nearby terrace. This soil encompassed the first 10 centimeters of the entire scraped area and
continued to the limit of excavation in the northeast and southeast corner. A concrete fragment was
recorded at eight centimeters within Zone 1. Zone 2 is defined by a 10YR 5/2 silty clay mottled 50
percent with a 10YR6/8 silty clay with caliche inclusions. This zone is likely slump over from when the
nearby utilities were buried and continues 35 meters to the east from the western end of the scraped
area. Zone 4 is heavily mottled, indicating more disturbance, and consists of 10YR 3/2, 10YR 5/2 and
10YR 6/8 silty clays with caliche inclusions. This soil stretches from the eastern boundary of Zone 2
and continues 25 meters to the east. A modern gin bottle was recorded next to a concrete fragment at
42 centimeters, indicating heavy disturbance in this zone.

Backhoe Trench Results:
Trenching verified the same soil types as shovel testing and made it clear that significant soil changes
did not occur in most areas without reaching over a meter in depth. Trenching also showed that most
areas within the APE that were not naturally high in elevation, showed extreme evidence of disturbance.
This disturbance is likely due to the original construction of IH 20 and is shown in the mottling of clay
and inclusions of caliche at such shallow depths. Topographically, the trenches placed in areas defined
as upland alluvial went to an average depth of 203 centimeters and were all terminated due to the
presence of the water table. Very few cultural materials were discovered in these trenches, and all
those recent, indicating a low likelihood for deeply buried archeological deposits. Trenches placed in
upland ridges went to an average depth of 209 centimeters, and the majority showed no evidence of
disturbance. Termination of these trenches occurred due to the presence of bedrock, or basal clay,
indicating an eroded surface with a low probability for cultural deposits. The one trench on an alluvial
terrace, overlooking Big Brushy Creek, went down to 300 centimeters. The trench was terminated
because 300 centimeters was the maximum reach of the backhoe. This was the deepest trench and
seemed a likely place for archeological deposits; however, there was an absence of any cultural
material. The scraped area near Potter Cemetery showed evidence of heavy construction and
disturbance. No evidence of grave shafts or any burial markers were discovered in the area. Overall
backhoe trenching showed archeological potential for deeply buried archeological deposits to be low
for even high probability areas within APE.

▪

APE Integrity: The APE has overall very poor integrity. The corridor is heavily impacted by the
construction of IH 20 and associated frontage roads. In addition, the majority of the survey area
contains drainages and culverts constructed between approximately zero and 20 meters from
the edge of the interstate on both north and south sides of IH 20. Areas that were not disturbed
by drainage improvements were generally disturbed by berm construction, asphalt paving,
utilities and commercial development. As a consequence of extensive agricultural activity along
the edges of the ROW and heavy impacts from grading and roadway construction, field crews
more commonly encountered underlying clays and along the eroded terraces shale bedrock was
encountered at relatively shallow depths.

Recommendations
▪

The archeological survey resulted in the identification of four sites—41KF183, 41KF184, 41KF185
and 41KF186—two Isolated Finds (IF)—IF1 and IF2—the previously identified site revisits of
41DL265, 41DL412, 41DL500, 41KF30 and 41KF130. No further testing is recommended for
any of the sites surveyed, including all newly recorded and revisited sites. All sites recorded and
revisited have been recommended not eligible for NRHP-listing.

▪

Eleven backhoe trenches were excavated across all Units proposed for trenching (Units 1, 9 and
13) with the exception of Unit 2, at the crossing of East Fork Trinity River, due to severe flooding.
The other suggested river crossings—Bachelor Creek, Eagan’s Creek and Big Brushy Creek—did

Archeological Survey of IH 20, Dallas and Kaufman Counties, Texas

55

have at least one and up to three backhoe trenches excavated. Unit 1 comprises the area southeast
of Potter’s Cemetery and this area was scraped to expose potential grave shafts associated with
the cemetery. No features were observed in this location. No features or intact archaeological
deposits were observed in any of the backhoe trenches across Units 9 and 13, neither at the creek
crossings nor on upland terrace locations between creek locations.
▪

No further work is recommended in any portion of the APE investigated as part of this study,
with the exception of shovel test survey and backhoe trenching in Unit 2. Unit 2 (Appendix A)
encompasses 85.06 acres surrounding the East Fork Trinity River. Throughout the field survey,
heavy rains and resultant flooding inundated this entire Unit selected for both shovel test survey
and backhoe trenching. According to PALM maps generated for the APE, this is one of the
highest probability areas for finding shallow and deeply buried, pre-contact, archaeological
sites. Unit 2 was revisited several times throughout the 24-day field survey period, and no
substantive subsurface testing could be conducted either via shovel test or backhoe trenching.
It is recommended that this Unit be surveyed at a later date when the flooding has subsided
and both shovel testing and backhoe trenching can be conducted.

▪

Comments on Evaluations: At sites 41KF183, 41KF184, 41KF185 and 41KF186, it has been
determined that there is no potential for future research within the APE. Site revisits within the
APE yielded no new or significant information about the sites, beyond an overall determination
that all five sites have been heavily impacted or destroyed by roadway improvements.
Evaluations for all sites, revisited and newly identified, are valid for evaluations within the APE.

Further Work: No further work is recommended in any portion of the APE investigated as part of
this study with the exception of shovel test survey and backhoe trenching in Unit 2.
Justification:
Unit 2 (Appendix A) encompasses the area surrounding the East Fork Trinity River. Throughout
the field survey, heavy rains and resultant flooding inundated this entire Unit selected for both
shovel test survey and backhoe trenching. According to PALM maps generated for the APE, this
is one of the highest probability areas for finding shallow and deeply buried, pre-contact,
archaeological sites. Unit 2 was revisited several times throughout the 24-day field survey
period, and no substantive subsurface testing could be conducted. No backhoe trenching could
be conducted as well. It is recommended that this Unit be surveyed at a later date when the
flooding has subsided and both shovel testing and backhoe trenching can be conducted.
All work for this survey was conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act under the guidelines presented in 36 CFR 800, and in compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas, whose guidelines are outlined under 12 TAC 26.
