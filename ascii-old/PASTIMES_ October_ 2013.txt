A Modern Look at the Billy Dixon "Long Shot"
In 1874 Kansas bison hide hunters moved into the Texas panhandle in search of large herds of bison that
had not been previously hunted. Along with the hide hunters, came merchants willing to risk their lives and
their merchandise to supply the hunters. What became known as
the Adobe Walls trading post was established in May of 1874 on
the north side of the Canadian river between Adobe Creek and
Bent Creek in what is now Hutchinson County, Texas.
On the morning of June 27th, 1874, the Adobe Walls trading
post was attacked by a large number of Southern Plains warriors of
the Cheyenne, Comanche, and Kiowa tribes. On the third day of
the battle one of the hide hunters, William "Billy" Dixon, used a
Sharps Rifle Company .50 caliber rifle to make what he referred to
as "a scratch shot," and what others have called "The Long Shot."
Firing at a distant group of Indian warriors mounted on horses, his
bullet struck one of the Indians knocking him from his horse. The
distance involved in making the "Long Shot" is still the subject of
much debate on buffalo rifle, sniper, and long distance hunting forums on the internet. Some modern target shooters have even promoted a Billy Dixon Long Shot shooting event.
This presentation will examine the Billy Dixon Long Shot
through the use of modern ballistic computer programs and a reexamination of earlier published accounts.
James Coverdale is a member of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma. He was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and lived
in Oklahoma until the age of 4 when he moved with his adopted parents to Perryton Texas. Introduced to guns at
the age of 13, he joined a junior marksmanship program and regularly practiced at the Perryton Pistol and Rifle Indoor range. In 1981 as a qualified Expert rifleman serving as a U.S. Army Infantry scout in the Republic of South Korea he was chosen to be trained on the US Army's M21 sniper rifle weapon system. After four weeks of training he
was posted to Guard Post Collier as a designated marksman inside the Demilitarized Zone between North and South
Korea. Since that time he continues to be actively involved in long range shooting and the shooting arts.

Antelope Creek Phase Residential Architecture: Insights from the Eastview Site
By Scott D. Brosowske
Over the last several seasons Courson Archaeological Research has conducted fieldwork at the Eastview
site, a small Antelope Creek phase site in the Canadian River valley of the Texas panhandle. Work has focused primarily on one of the several burned residential structures present at the site. Given the nature of the
burning and the excellent state of preservation, this feature provides remarkable insights into the methods and
materials used to construct this structure. To no surprise, the results indicate that the builders made excellent
use of raw materials that were readily available and incorporated architectural design elements that were particularly well adapted to the extreme weather conditions that characterize the high plains environment. This
article briefly examines the ongoing investigations at this residential structure.
Eastview (41RB153) is a small Antelope Creek phase (A.D. 1250-1500) settlement overlooking Dugout
Creek, a south flowing tributary to the Canadian River in Roberts County, Texas. The site was discovered in
the spring of 2005 while conducting a pedestrian survey of the Lips Ranch, a large ranch along the Canadian
River breaks owned by the Courson Family of Perryton, Texas (Brosowske 2006). This site is atop a high exposed ridge nearly 40 m higher and 600 m west of Dugout Creek (Figure 1). A geophysical survey, using a
soil resistance meter and a gradiometer, examined 4500 m2 of the site. This survey identified five or six
burned residential structures, hearths, and middens. Limited test excavations verified the existence of houses at
the site and that they were burned. Two AMS dates on corn obtained from the central hearth of a house near
the southern end of the site yielded calibrated ages of A.D. 1350 ±15 (ISGS #A1437) and A.D. 1350 ±20
(ISGS #A1442). In 2011 a linear block of 2-x-2 meter units was excavated across the northernmost residential
structure at the site. In 2012 two additional 2-x-2 meter units were extended to the south of the original block.
This summer additional units were opened to examine key portions of the structure. To date, a total of 41 m 2
have been excavated at this burned structure.

Excavations completed thus far have exposed all of the east wall and most of the entryway, the northeast and southeast corners and adjacent portions of the north and south walls, the southwestern corner, a little
more than half of the west wall, and a strip across the interior of the house from the entryway to the southwest
corner (Figure 2). Assuming that the house is symmetrical, these investigations indicate the presence of a
large, nearly square residential structure with slightly rounded corners that is 8.0 m from west to east and 7.15
m from north to south.
The house was built over a shallow pit with a level floor. Because the ground surface in this area of the site
gradually slopes from west to east, this pit is shallowest along the east wall (i.e., 25 cm) and gradually gets
deeper as you proceed across the house to the west wall (i.e., 43 cm). Burned clay plaster along numerous portions of the house pit wall suggest that most, if not all, portions of these shallow walls were plastered to keep
them from slumping. Excavations in the northeastern corner of the house exposed a 2.5 m wide raised area.
This area is plastered and is about 23 cm higher than the adjoining house floor. Previous investigations of similar houses in the region suggest that this feature is a “raised bench” that may continue all along the north side
of the house (see Green 1986; Lintz 1986). In contrast to other Antelope Creek phase houses of this form,
typically referred to as a Type I house (see Lintz 1986: 89-102), this structure appears to lack a corresponding
bench along the south wall.

Continued from Page 5

The house pit walls are lined with juniper posts between 12 cm and 16 cm in diameter. These posts extend
halfway into the pit wall and are burned down to the aboriginal ground surface. From center to center, these
wall posts are spaced about 45 cm apart and extend below the floor to a depth of 50 to 70 cm. All of the wall
posts slope inward at approximately 10° to 15°. Similar inward sloping walls are also documented at other
Antelope Creek phase houses in the region (Boyd 2004; Green 1986: 84; Lintz 2012; personal communication). As will be discussed later, portions of wall posts above the ground surface burned and fell inward into
the house.
A covered entryway about 80 cm wide extends outside the house for a distance of at least 2.0 m along the
center of the east wall. The sides of this plastered entryway slope toward the center and are about 12 cm to 15
cm higher than the central portion of the entryway. The margins of the entry are marked by 6 cm to 8 cm diameter posts separated by about 20 cm to 25 cm. This extended entryway gently slopes from the aboriginal
ground surface downward into the house. The entryway extends into the interior of the structure nearly 75 cm
where it terminates in a circular cold trap 10 cm deeper than the house floor. The margins of the cold trap are
separated from the surrounding house floor by a low, semicircular shaped raised sill.
Interior house features identified thus far include a central hearth, one central support post, and a large intrusive pit that post-dates the house. The hearth is centrally located within the house and was 35 cm in diameter and 26 cm deep. The hearth had vertical walls with a basin shaped bottom. The margins of the hearth are
marked by a low circular, raised clay sill and the interior was plastered with clay. A single interior support
post was located northeast of the central hearth. This post was only 12 cm in diameter, extended below the
floor to a depth of 61 cm, and like the wall posts, was made of juniper.
Immediately southwest of the hearth is a large intrusive pit that was excavated into the house depression
well after the structure was burned and abandoned, but before the house pit was completely filled. Soil profiles near the center of the structure indicate that about 28 cm of colluvial and aeolian fill covered 7 to 10 cm
of burned debris laying on the house floor before this pit was excavated into the house depression. This pit is
roughly circular in shape, measuring about 200 cm in diameter, and ranges in depth from 105 cm to 121 cm.
The original function of this feature is unknown, but it was later backfilled with an abundance of trash debris
(i.e., faunal remains, chipped stone, ash and charcoal, ceramics, and groundstone). This feature stands in
marked contrast to the rest of the house fill where, besides the burned structural debris, relatively little cultural
material was recovered.
As can be seen in Figure 2, an abundance of charred material, consisting of burned wood and grass, was
encountered throughout many areas of the structure. The largest burned timbers observed thus far all appear to
represent wall members (i.e., they are near the walls). Many of these timbers lay at right angles to walls,
while others fell at odd angles (Figure 3). Numerous smaller saplings about 4 cm to 6 cm in diameter of are
also present on the house floor. In many instances, these smaller sticks lay perpendicular to and overlie the
larger wall members indicating that they were attached horizontally to the exterior of the structure walls.

Figure 3 Northeast Corner of House with Wall Posts on Floor
Throughout all areas of the structure concentrations of
burned grass were encountered. In some instances this
material was found lying directly on the floor between
timbers, but when directly associated with charred wood
it was often observed overlying vertical and horizontal
wall members indicating that the exterior of the house
was covered with grass thatch (Figure 4). In contrast,
there were two large areas east and southeast of the central hearth containing large amounts of burned grass lying
directly on the floor. Although poorly preserved, the area
to the east clearly represents the remains of a large,
loosely woven grass mat held together on the upper side
by small, 1 cm to 2 cm diameter vertical and horizontal
sticks. The overall distance from the walls, the small size
of the wooden members present, and the lack of complete
burning may suggest that it represents a short vertical
partition within the house rather than something associated with the walls or roof.

Lastly, a final area of interest within the house was two upside down metates recovered within the fill overlying the floor in the southwest corner of the structure (Figure 5). The larger, southernmost metate was about
30 cm from the west wall and 100 cm from the south wall and the smaller metate to the north was about 70 cm
from the west wall and 220 cm from the south wall. The fill sequence associated with the larger metate shows
that two large, wall post size timbers first burned and collapsed into the house. This was followed by a period
where sterile soil removed during the original excavation of the house pit was redeposited as fill covering these
two posts. Notably, this fill was thickest along the perimeters of the house pit and it sloped downward toward
the center of the structure. Next, the metate entered the house pit resting directly upon this sterile fill. Lastly,
another large wall post fell into the house coming to rest on top of the metate (Figure 6). A similar fill sequence was noted for the smaller metate except that there were no posts resting on top of it.

Figure 5 Metates and Burned Timbers in Southwestern Corner of Structure
This fill sequence raises several questions that currently remain unanswered. First, did the fill sequence observed occur rapidly or over a longer period of time? Second, how did the sterile fill observed under
the metates enter the house fill? Lastly, if the metates were leaning up against the outside walls of the house,
how did they come to rest so far from the edges of the house pit?

The historic record
documents three main
house types used by
sedentary or semisedentary plains societies (see DeMallie
2001). These include
earth lodges, domed
lodges covered with
bark, and beehive
shaped,
grass
thatched structures.
Similar to other sites
in the region with
burned
structures
(e.g., Jack Allen,
Hank and Drover),
the ongoing excavations at the Eastview
site provides remarkable information regarding the architectural design of Type I
Antelope Creek phase Figure 6 View showing the Stratigraphic Relationship between Timbers, Sterile
houses and the mateFill, and Metate
rials used in their
construction.
Considering the overall size of the Eastview house (i.e., 8.0 x 7.15 m), the wide spacing and small size
of the wall posts coupled with walls that leaned inward clearly indicates that the house lacked a heavy roof
consisting of large timbers. This conclusion is further supported by the absence of large wooden members in
the center of the house. Altogether, this evidence clearly indicates a structure with walls and a roof incapable
of supporting an earthen covering (i.e., an earthlodge).
The evidence documented at Eastview is clearly more in line with what would be expected domed or
beehive shaped structures recorded for the plains. First and foremost, these house forms both incorporate fairly
lightweight framed designs that have similarly sized wall posts spaced at analogous distances. They also have
wall posts that slant inward as is clearly represented at Eastview and other sites in the region. In these structures, the butt ends of wall posts are set into the ground around the perimeter with the upper, smaller ends bent
inward over and attached to a freestanding frame in the center of the house. Although only a single central
post has yet to be found at the Eastview house, Type I house forms typically have four support posts which
would have ideal for either a domed or beehive shaped structure. Both of these types of house designs incorporate smaller, horizontal saplings attached to the exterior of the structure frame. These rows of saplings are attached at right angles to the upright timbers at regular intervals. They encircle the house frame beginning just
above the ground and continue to the top of the structure. Once again, this design appears to be represented at
Eastview. Lastly, the abundance of burned grass present at Eastview indicates that the house was covered with
grass thatch rather than bark, a resource that would not have been abundant in the area.

In sum, all of the evidence documented for the Eastview house suggests the presence of lightweight timber
framed house covered with grass thatch. Whether the house was ultimately dome or beehive shaped has yet to
be clearly determined. With this being said, other Type I houses in the area clearly had portions of the roof
around and adjacent to the smoke hole plastered with clay. If this was the case, a dome shaped structure
clearly would have provided a roof type more amenable to plastering than a beehive shaped design. Future
investigations at this house should continue to provide detailed information regarding the construction of this
structure.

The Swisher County Archives and Museum began in 1963 in the Swisher County courthouse basement and
was moved to its present location in 1981. The museum houses artifacts from prehistoric mammoths and phytosaur fossils to collections of ranch and farm artifacts. The museum is soon to acquire a prehistoric Equus
scotti horse found near Lake Mackenzie .

An early 1900 five-room house, rebuilt inside the main exhibit hall, is furnished with authentic antiques and clothing from that era. Guests are invited to walk through the house and step back in time.

A furnished replica of the J.O. Bass Blacksmith Shop, famous spur and bridle maker featured on American
Pickers and the Antique Roadshow, is also located in main exhibit hall and features Bass' original tools and
equipment. The museum has copies of Mr. Bass’ journal from 1915 - 1924 where he kept records and descriptions of his famous spurs. The museum receives many calls from collectors to authenticate their collection. A
collection of spurs and bridles are also on exhibit.

Several of the “Red River War” battles occurred in Swisher and Briscoe
County and the museum features a display with artifacts from the famous
Mackenzie Pony Kill site that occurred
18 miles east of present day Tulia
where a Texas Historical Marker and
Quanah Parker Trail arrow mark the
historic location. After a battle and the
fleeing of the Indians in the Palo Duro
Canyon, Mackenzie ordered the Indian’s horses moved further south to
this location in Swisher County where
approximately 1,000 horses were destroyed to render the Indians helpless so they would retreat to the reservations.

The museum has on display
many Indian artifacts found near
playa lakes or along the Tule
Creeks. Also on display is the
Quanah Parker peyote ceremonial robe used by Quanah during his peyote religious ceremony. Quanah is one
of the most infamous leaders of the Comanche. He led the Indian attack in the battle of Adobe Walls, but he
also led his people to retreat to the reservation where he dealt with and made friends with many white leaders
of the day including Theodore Roosevelt.

The JA ranch at one time encompassed six counties or
1,000,000 acres including most of present day Swisher County
known then as the “Tule Division” land purchased by Charles
Goodnight when he was the manager of the ranch. The Swisher
County Museum has an original JA line cabin built in circa
1883 located near a natural watering hole east of Tulia. The
cabin is the first building built in what is present day Swisher
County and was used by cowboys ridin’ the fence line. Since
the cowboys were too far to return to headquarters before dark
they needed a place to sleep during the cold winter nights. This
cabin is registered with the Texas Historical Commission.
Also outside is the Jowell House originally a two room home for two families built in circa 1909. The house
was added onto in the 30’s and one side remodeled into a kitchen. The house was occupied until 1955 and has
been restored and furnished depicting family life of the 30’s and 40’s.

Other displays include a Santa Fe

Train collection, military artifacts, quilts dating from the civil war and pictures from Swisher County’s early
beginnings including pictures of pioneer dugouts .
