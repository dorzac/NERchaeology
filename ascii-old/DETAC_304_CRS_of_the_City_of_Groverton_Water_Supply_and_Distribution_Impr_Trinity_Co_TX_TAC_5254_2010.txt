ABSTRACT
In June 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed 9.3 km (5.8 mile) of 2”, 6”, and 8”
replacement and new water pipelines in Groveton, Texas for KSA Engineers in Trinity
County, Texas. As a subdivision of the State of Texas, the survey was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit #5254. The proposed pipelines will be placed in existing utility
right-of-ways with buried cables and overhead power lines. The pedestrian survey was
conducted with a combination of visual examination along the city streets and shovel
testing along a pipeline outside the confines of city streets. Visual inspection of the rightof-way and relationship to standing structures that date from the early occupation of
Groveton show the potential for impacting intact cultural features associated with early
Groveton is minimal in the existing utility corridors. Shovel testing along the one
pipeline outside of town was negative; no artifacts were collected. No further
investigations are recommended however, if any artifacts or bones are recovered during
construction, than excavation should stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to
evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no
effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
In June 2009, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a cultural
resources survey of the proposed Groveton water supply and distribution improvements
with 2”, 6”, and 8” pipelines in 9.3 km (5.8 mile) of existing utility right-of-ways and the
drilling of a new water well (Figure 1). Because Groveton is a subdivision of the State of
Texas, the survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #5254. The report was
reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.

The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources
within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications
requested by the THC (Martin 1999). While several houses adjacent to the right-of-way
date to the early part of the twentieth century, none of the houses will be impacted. In
lots where modern houses have replaced older homes, the proposed excavations will be
more than 10 m (33 ft) from where the original house stood. No cultural resources were
found during the survey. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of
“no effect” to cultural resources for the proposed pipeline.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project includes modifications to an existing water plant, excavation of 26 trenches
adjacent to city streets, and the use of expanding pipe in 6 old waterlines in existing
utility right-of-way corridors throughout the city. The existing utility corridors contain
overhead power lines, buried phone cables, and the existing water pipeline that will be
replaced. Project area boundaries were provided during a tour of the project area by a
KSA engineer prior to the survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Trinity County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys of which few have been published or listed on
the Site Atlas. Most investigations across the county were conducted for oil and gas
interests and range from large pipeline corridors, e.g., Cordova and Martin (2007) and
Turpin 2006, surveys for pipelines across the central portion of the county to several
small-scale surveys conducted for well pads and access road, e.g., Corbin 1985 and Galan
2009, and rural water pipelines, e.g., Moore (2006). Of the surveys, the work by Cordova
and Martin (2007) is the largest and most far reaching survey across the county. Their
survey focused on floodplains and first terraces totaling 25 km (15 miles) along a 101 km
(63 mile) pipeline corridor crossing Houston, Trinity, and Polk Counties (Cordova and
Martin 2007). This work successfully documented only one site, 41PK256, and revisited
41PK247 while 41TJ7 could not be relocated. Likewise, the other large scale surveys
recorded few sites despite crossing both bottoms and uplands both across the county and in
the Davy Crocket National Forest which extends into nearby Houston County, e.g. Bond
and Moore 1980, during which 6000 acres was surveyed and only seven sites from
Archaic to Early Ceramic periods were recorded.

In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of
primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf
Coastal Plain, Aten’s description of the upper Texas coast (Aten 1983), as well as an
assessment of the Big Thicket National Preserve (Shafer et al. 1975). The Big Thicket
Assessment identified sites in the region with five characteristics: 1) Prehistoric
archaeological sites are on elevated landforms in close proximity to larger streams or
rivers; 2) Burned clay, charcoal, and clam shells are common items in association with
more traditional lithic and ceramic debris on archaeological sites; 3) Sites were found on
“sand middens” (sandy matrix on clayey terraces; 4) An absence of mounds; 5) Sites are
few and far between or were not accessible by either modern flooding deep burial, modern
property boundaries, the survey areas were outside prehistoric habitation areas, or sites
were destroyed by meandering streams (Shafer 1975:57-67). Additionally, the Texas

3

Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for
the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This
document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a particular facet of
northeast Texas prehistory.

This plan serves to synthesize the current state of

archaeological research in the region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed
in future research and cultural resources management.

Several weak areas in

archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these studies.

Cultural

chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic continuities are
some of the general research directions that these recent studies emphasize as important for
developing future archaeological research designs.

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (prior to 7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D.
800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro
American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993).

The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of
hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990).
Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested that early occupations were
principally distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Archaic period is
represented by tool technology progressed from the large points that typify the PaleoIndian period to the use of sand and grog tempered ceramics in the Early Ceramic period
and the bow and arrow in the Late Prehistoric period. The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D.
800) stage represents a technological shift to the use of sandy-paste ceramics following the
Tchefuncte ceramic tradition of the lower Mississippi River Valley without a great change
in subsistence (Shafer 1975:18). The Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1600) represents the
addition of the bow and arrow, a shift to smaller lithic tools, varied ceramic paste additions,
but little change in subsistence (Shafer 1975:20; Story et al. 1990). Population changes
during the Late Prehistoric period include an incursion by Caddo from the north around

4

A.D. 1400 in the form of isolated hamlets and farmsteads along the Neches and Angelina
Rivers (Shafer 1975:20). Evidence of trade between the Caddo and local Atakapan tribes in
the region includes the presence of both Caddo and Galveston Bay ceramics near modern
day Livingston and Conroe (Shafer 1975:21) as commercial networks were established.

The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations’ domination of the
area, to the American immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns, and counties. Contact
with Spanish (Presidio San Augstin de Ahumada, est. 1756, near modern Wallisville) in the
eighteenth century was deadly to the native population as infections diminished the
populations to the brink of extinction and opened the land for Alabama and Koasati
(Coushatta) incursions by the nineteenth century (Shafer 1975:23-24).

American

settlement of the area eventually forced the remaining Alabama and Coushatta to a
reservation by 1854 (Shafer 1975:26).

Trinity County was initially part of Houston County at its inception in 1837 and part of
Liberty County as it was divided from Houston County in 1841. The first American settler
in the area was Jesse James who, in 1844, settled along Alabama Creek, as a trader. Trinity
County, with the county seat in Sumpter, was established in 1850 as steamboat traffic
provided a means of commerce between the increasing number of plantations in the county
and the Gulf Coast. Trinity County was relatively anarchic throughout the years of the
Civil War and Reconstruction as Confederate deserters, vigilantes, the KKK, and
individual outlaws intimidated residence of the county. The arrival of the Great Northern
Railroad in the county caused the shift in population and in the county seat from Sumpter
to Trinity (1873) and then Pennington (1876). The construction of the Sabine Branch of
the railroad in the early 1880’s was built to foster a growing forest industry using rail
instead of river transportation of lumber (Johnson and Gerland 1996:52). The arrival of the
lumber industry and associated saw mills sparked the foundation of Groveton in 1881 and
the shift of the county seat in 1882 to the town north of the railroad tracks from the Trinity
County and Sabine Pass Land and Railway Company lumber mill (THA 2009).

5

The town of Groveton began as a saloon built by William Magee and a residence built by
Tom Wortham.

The town grew as the lumber company platted then sold lots to

individuals. The town square and construction material for a courthouse was donated by
the lumber company in 1884. The town became incorporated in 1919. Groveton continued
to grow until 1928 as most other sawmill were closed. The population of Groveton
declined from 4,000 in 1928 to 1,046 in 1931 with the closing of the Trinity Lumber
Company saw mill in Groveton on 31 December 1930. Closing of the mill and the
beginning of the Great Depression pushed the residence of Groveton into working for the
Civilian Conservation Corps for forest restoration and road work projects, the Works
Progress Administration for the construction of schools in several towns, and the Texas
Rural Community Project to build houses. The construction of Lake Livingston in the
1960s’ along with the revitalization of the timber industry in the 1980s’ and the growth of
the oil industry in the 1990s’ combined with tourism to lake and the Davy Crocket National
Forest play a prominent role in the area’s commercial enterprises today (THA 2009).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the
Archaeological Protection Act of 1979 (PL96-95; 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm); and the guidelines
set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of Professional
Archaeologists.

The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey area. If sites were found, then the investigations were to
delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.

6

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using
maps and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009). The site location maps and cultural resources
records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites
within or in close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas was consulted for
published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.

DETAC conducted a 100 percent visual examination of the area and shovel tested along the
one pipeline that was not in the confines of an existing utility right-of-way. The visual
examination was conducted along city streets. Photographs were taken of houses more
than 50 years old to determine their relationship to the proposed excavation and create a
photographic record of houses that may be potentially significant to the early development
of Groveton, e.g., from the end of the nineteenth century or associated with a person
significant to the development of Groveton. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys.
According to these guidelines, linear project areas require a minimum of 16 shovel test per
1.6 km (1 mile). Unfortunately, a majority of the pipeline right-of-way contains several
other buried utilities and was in residential yards. The potential for breaking a phone or
other cable along with the amount of modern debris anticipated in shovel tests minimized
the value of shovel testing. In the one pipeline that was shovel tested, excavations included
digging an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels
down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened
through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each
shovel test were recorded.

7

RESULTS
The closest documented cultural resources survey was for the FHWA on the west edge of
town north of Hwy 94. The next closest surveys were conducted by the Forest Service in
1981, 1990, and 1996 north and west of the town. Additionally, PBS&J conducted a
survey for a pipeline that passed south of town. No sites were documented during the
surveys. The closest sites were found by the Forest Service in 1984, 1986, and 1997
between 1.6 km (1 mile) and 5 km (3.1 miles) north-northeast of Groveton. There are
three historical markers within Groveton: the Glenwood Cemetery (THC 2009: Site Atlas
Number 13551), Trinity County Courthouse (THC 2009: Site Atlas Number 13075), and
Trinity County Seats (THC 2009: Site Atlas Number 7971).

None of the markers or

their associated properties will be impacted by the proposed pipelines.

The environmental setting of the proposed pipelines is dominated by existing right-ofways adjacent to city streets in residential yards. A 3 m (10 ft) corridor includes buried
waterlines, telephone cables, an overhead power lines. The new and replacement lines
will be among the other buried resources. Most notably, the yards have been landscaped
by individual residence. Vegetation along the right-of-way was dominated by various
grasses and bushes ranging from well maintained yards to overgrowth more than 2 m (6
ft) high. The exception is a replacement line that passes through a pasture at the northern
limit of the city. Topographically, Groveton is on the summit of a wide upland ridge with
little elevation change across the project area roughly 6 km (3.7 miles) east of Caney
Creek and 5 km (3.1 miles) east of Piney Creek. Soils along the pipelines are limited to
Fuller fine sandy loam with isolated areas of Keltys fine sandy loam and Kurth fine sandy
loam (NRCS 2009). Fuller soils consist of 65 cm (27 inches) of fine sandy loam over
loam and clay loam ancient marine deposits. Keltys soils include 35 cm (14 inches) of
fine sandy loam over loam and clay loam. Kurth soils consist of 40 cm (17 inches) of
fine sandy loam over sandy clay loam and clay loam. All three of theses soils formed on
loamy marine deposits of the Eocene Epoch.

Research at the Trinity County Museum uncovered several documents that add
information to the early habitation of the area before the incorporation of Groveton and

8

afterwards.

Resources reviewed include an undocumented manuscript provided by

Suzanne Waller, Curator of the Trinity County Museum citing a thesis written by Carl
Brannen (1942), additionally Journey to Jubilee, Groveton, Texas, USA (Adams 1980),
Trinity County Beginnings (Hensley 1986), Assessor’s Abstract of Trinity County Texas
Town of Groveton records (AATCTTG), the Groveton Town plat map from 1882
showing the original blocks and lots as platted by the Trinity County and Sabine Pass
Land and Timber Company, and the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps from 1907, 1912, and
1933 were all read, synthesized and incorporated in the field visit (Figure 2). The
manuscript, Adams (1980), and Hensley (1986) provided historical background about the
foundation of Groveton and important inhabitants. The AATCTTG records, plat map,
and Sanborn maps were combined to develop block and lot associations between
individuals, their associated properties, and structures depicted on the maps. Combined
with the pedestrian survey, these resources allowed for the prediction of the how long
various properties were used and the potential for finding intact buried features when the
pipeline trenches are excavated.

The Brannen thesis is based on oral interviews and research. According to Brannen, the
earliest resident of the land that would become Groveton was Ed Sims. The Sims house
was about a block east of the modern courthouse lawn but it was abandoned early in the
Civil War. The house was then repaired and lived in by a former slave Moss Randolph in
1875. Moss Randolph left the area as the town grew and the house was taken over by
Jack Eaves. The Groveton Town plat was filed on 14 November 1882 (Deed Records).
With materials donated by the Trinity County and Sabine Pass Land and Timber
Company built a courthouse at the corner of Sloan (now Main) Street and First Street
(Hensley 1986:66). In 1908 a more stable and permanent structure was built in the
location of the modern courthouse.

Assembling the historical information and the proposed pipeline right-of-ways, the
research focused on searching historical records for the location of William Magee’s
saloon along the residences of Tom Wortham’s and Ed Sims. Initially, the AATCTTG

records were searched for the individual names Eaves, Magee, Wortham, and Sims in
Blocks adjacent to the proposed pipelines. This search was successful in finding both
Eaves and Magee (Figure 3).

Eaves (AR, AL, AB, or A) is listed in Block 18 Lots 12 and 13 from 1902 until 1928.
The same residence is depicted on all three Sanborn maps and, if the orientation
described in the Brannen thesis is correct, this matches the description that the Eaves
residence was about a block east of the Public Square. There are two inconsistencies, the
ownership was listed as A. Eaves instead of Jack Eaves, and began in 1902 twenty years
after the town was platted and lots were sold to individuals. Previous owners of the lots
were Granberry M (1888 – 1890), Dunham (1890 – 1899), and Nelms (1900 – 1902).
The Eaves residence in Block 18 Lots 12 and 13 was most likely a son or daughter of
Jack Eaves because of the time between the inception of Groveton and the documented
ownership (with previous owners) of the lots.

Magee WJ(William?) and Magee B (Bill aka William?) listed as the owner of Block 18
lots 15 and 16 in 1889 and 1890 and Block 18 lots 6 through 11 in 1906. Lots 15 and 16
are not located along the pipeline; however, lots 6 through 11 are located along the East
First Street pipeline between Church and Sycamore streets. Description of the property is
in the First Street Section.

The initial inspection of the Sanborn maps revealed that the dwellings ranged from 6 to
25 m (20 to 80 ft) from the edge of the road. Road widths range from 40 ft toward the
edge of town to 60 ft in the middle of town. The buildings between the Public Square
and the railroad were businesses and were closer to the roads and on smaller properties
that may encompass only one or two lots. Immediately west, north, and east of the town
square the buildings are all residences or outbuildings associated with the residence.
Residential buildings are set further from the road; however, road expansion and the
excavation of utility right-of-ways adjacent to modern streets has occurred to with 6 m
(20 ft) of the houses on East First Street.

The field work for the waterline project focused on assessing the potential for finding
structures or remains of historical significance along the proposed pipelines.

The

pedestrian survey was conducted by walking along the right-of-way inspecting the yards
and houses for proximity of the existing structure to the right-of-way and age of the
structure. Photographs were taken of all houses which appeared to be more than 50 years
old and notes were made about foundation, general structure, exterior covering material,
roof, chimney, windows, entrance doorway, composite appearance, auxiliary
construction, and other potently diagnostic features to determine the age of the structure.
The field work was compared with the Sanborn maps to identify any structures still
standing from the beginning of the twentieth century.

For the report, each line is

discussed separately with regards to landownership over time followed by a visual
inspection of structures along the pipelines. Shovel testing was limited to one pipeline as
this was the only portion of the project not within the confines of city streets, yards, and
utility right-of-ways.
First Street Pipelines
First Street is US Highway 287 through town. Three sections of the pipeline will follow
First Street: East First Street (Magee to Vickery), West First Street (Womack to Snyder),
and a third portion east of downtown roughly 320 m (1500 ft) long in a mixed business
and residential part of town.

The First Street pipeline will consist of expanding pipe

casting with no trench from Magee (Chandler on Sanborn maps) to FM 355 (Robb on
Sanborn maps). Outside the downtown area the pipeline will be placed in an open trench
in an existing buried utility right-of-way 3 m (15ft) south of the road surface.

East First Street
The East First St. Pipeline will consist of buried utility right-of-way 3 m (15ft) south of
the road surface from FM355 to Vickery. The excavation will not impact any of the
standing structures but the right-of-way will be roughly 6 m (20 ft) from the buildings.
The AATCTTG records extend from the square to Sycamore, Blocks 17 and 18, wile the
Sanborn maps 1907 and 1912 coverage extends to 3rd Alley and to Sycamore on the
Sanborn 1933 map). From F.M. 355 to Vickery the pipe will be placed in an open trench.

13

This portion of the pipeline passes in front of dwellings with leveled and maintained
yards (Figure 4a). Without access to the houses, each was examined from the right-ofway with notes and photographs. A total of eight houses were examined as being
potential from the early part of the twentieth century. Of these, the oldest house was at
362 East First St.

The house at 362 East First St is visible on the 1933 Sanborn map (no coverage on 1907
and 1912 maps)( Figure 4b). The house is a one story L-shape with an addition behind
the east end of the house (Figure 4c). The east end extends forward to the end of the
porch and backward from the west end of the house. This extension forms a large room
with a bay under a hipped roof with exposed rafters. The frieze is decorated with vertical
molding and corners with decorative drops or pendants. The west end of the house is
rectangular with a hipped roof and exposed rafters. The front of the west side of the
house has a four bay porch with five single leaf doors. Each door has a ten-window
transom with plain surrounds. The doors are composed of 15 lights each (3 wide and 5
high) Columns on the porch are square brick with no capital or base. The pedestal is a
low wall around the porch. Chimneys are inside with the west one centered on the gabled
while the east chimney is central on a room. Each chimney is a single stack. Windows
on the bay and sides of the house are all 4/4 double hung with plain trim. Exterior
covering is vertical board and plain batten with horizontal weather boarding above the
room walls. The foundation is dry press brick in a pier and beam foundation. Masonry
over the entire house is dry press brick in a common bond pattern on the columns of the
porch and chimneys. The house has elements of the Victorian style (non-symmetric,
embellishments, bay windows) but it is missing many of the diagnostic characteristics,
e.g., lattice, window sashes, gingerbread porch, and ornamental turrets. This house
appears to be later borrowing some elements of the style from the early to mid twentieth
century.

The West First St. Pipeline will consist of buried utility right-of-way 3 m (15ft) south of
the road surface from Womack to Snyder streets. The excavation will not impact any of

the standing structures but the right-of-way will be roughly 6 m (20 ft) from the
buildings. The AATCTTG records along with the Sanborn 1907 and 1912 maps extend
from the town square to Womack Street. The remainder of the pipeline is outside the
coverage. The Sanborn map from 1933 shows only five dwellings on the first three
blocks. Of these dwellings, a still standing example is at 477 West First Street (Figure
5a).

The house at 477 West First Street is a one story square shape with a porch that wraps
around the northeast corner of the house (Figure 5b). The porch has four bays separated
by square columns. Columns are square with simple capital and base. The roof is a
truncated hip with triangular dormers and plain border and frieze. Front door is a single
leaf with 15 panels (3 wide, 5 tall) and plain trim; the upper nine panels on the door are
glass. An identical second door is on the east side of the house. The only difference in
the doors is the front door has recessed lights on either side with the same pattern as the
door. Windows on the house are 1/1 double hung except for the windows on the porch
which have the same light pattern as the door and sidelights. Exterior cover is horizontal
novelty siding. The chimney is a single stack outside end chimney on the west gable.
The foundation is dry pressed brick pier and beam. All of the masonry is a common bond
brick pattern. This house is from the early part of the twentieth century.

First Street pipelines are unique among the proposed excavation. Street widening away
from the center of town has brought the utility right-of-way in close proximity to several
houses that date to the early portion of the twentieth century. By examining the Sanborn
maps and inspecting the proximity of the buildings to the right-of-way it is possible to
ascertain the distance between the right-of-way to those locations where early houses
may have stood. Despite road widening, none of the standing structures or the potential
locations of buried remains from demolished houses is within the proposed right-of-way.
No further work is recommended for the First Street pipeline segments.

West Second Street Pipeline
The W. 2nd St. pipeline will be in an open trench roughly 4 m (15 ft) north of the
road surface and extend approximately 800 m (2625 ft) from Crow Ave. to N. Main St.
The western half of this segment, from Crow to Kenley, is outside of the historic map
coverage. The 1933 Sanborn map does extend to cover an area just west of Kenley.
The eastern half of the pipeline from Womack to Main is included on the 1907, 1912, and
1933 Sanborn along with south sides of Blocks 1, 2, and 3 in lots 12 through 22 of each
block in the AATCTTG records. The 1907, 1912, and Sanborn maps show the
residences west of the public square are all roughly 50 ft from the edge of the street.

The visual inspection found the houses were all roughly 10 m (30 ft) from the right-ofway. Of the houses on the Sanborn maps 5 are the same from the 1907, 1912, and 1933
maps. West of Magee St. all of the residences are all modern ranch style houses. No
further work is recommended for the Second Street pipeline.

Remaining Pipeline Segments
The remaining pipelines fit into two categories; those with houses that are 10 m (30 ft) or
more from the proposed right-of-way, and those that have modern houses on them.
Pipeline right-of-ways 10 m (30 ft) or more from houses that are visible on the Sanborn
maps include Main Street (Highway 94/Sloan st), Church Street, and Fourth Street
(Formerly Third Street). Pipeline right-of-ways that are outside Sanborn map coverage
and have modern Ranch style houses or mobile homes include Crow Street, Kenley
Street, North Magee Street, Sixth Street, Seventh Street, Eighth Street, Devine Street, and
Rainey Street. Because of the distance between the early twentieth century houses and
the proposed right-of-way and the more common modern houses, no further work is
recommended.

Proposed Well
The proposed well will be excavated in an existing facility. This area is outside the older
portion of Groveton along Front Street and near the old railroad grade. No shovel tests

18

were excavated. Visual examination found modern machinery in a gravel yard with a
fence. No further work is recommended.

Shovel testing was conducted along the proposed pipeline at the north edge of town
following an existing pipeline right-of-way for 515 m (1690 ft) between Raney Street and
Highway 94 (Figure 2). The pipeline will cross two pastures. Soils were described as
Fuller fine sandy loam. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated along the right-of-way
(Table 1). Soils observed in shovel tests ranged in depth from 30 to 80 cm (12 to 30
inches) of light brown sandy loam. No cultural resources were found in shovel tests or
during the surface collection. DETAC is requesting concurrence with a determination of
“no effect to historic properties” for the segment. No further work is recommended for
the pipeline.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Groveton water pipeline project area will impact a narrow portion adjacent
to city streets in the town. The proposed pipelines and well will both replace existing
lines and expand coverage by either using an expanding pipe under city streets or the
excavation in existing buried utility right-of-ways servicing several houses adjacent to the
project area. Topography and modern disturbances suggest the trenches will have a low
probability for containing intact cultural resources.

Given the proposed right-of-way along First Street is in close proximity to standing
structures that were built within the first 20 years of founding Groveton and streets have
been widened, the potential for impacting structural remains of houses that have been
destroyed since is minimal. Examination of the Sanborn maps shows the buildings were
offset an equal distance from the road edges. Despite the road widening the remaining
buildings show the earlier houses are outside the proposed right-of-way by 6 to 10 (20 to
33 ft). The remaining pipeline segments are further from the early twentieth century
buildings and expansion of Groveton over the past 50 years is evident in the use of Ranch
style houses and mobile homes. No further work is recommended for the replacement
and new pipelines in Groveton.

In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based on the
investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources along the
pipelines. Excavation should proceed with caution and should stop excavation and
contact a qualified archaeologist if any artifacts or bones are uncovered. DETAC is
requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible
properties for the proposed project area.
