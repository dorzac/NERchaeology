Abstract
Medina Consultants, Inc., San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeology to
conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower with
accompanying access and utility rights-of way between Brazoria and Lake Jackson in Brazoria
County. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA;
47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an
undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological
report was provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 17th, 2009. A thorough pedestrian survey of
the surface area was concluded before two trackhoe trenches were excavated. No evidence of
cultural material was observed either on or below the surface, and therefore no artifacts were
collected or curated.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Medina Consulting, Inc. be allowed
to oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.

Introduction

Medina Consulting, Inc. is the consulting firm
employed to acquire clearance for the erection
of a celluar telephone tower to be constructed
by AT&T adjacent to Sugar Mill Lane between
Brazoria and Lake Jackson in Brazoria County,
Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Medina contracted
with Terras Antiguas to conduct an
archaeological investigation of the proposed
tower site. Although no public funding was
involved in the proposed development of the
property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic
Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a
cultural resources survey be conducted prior to
Figure 1. Location of the project area and
such an undertaking.
Brazoria County.

In December 2008, Tierras Antiguas
Archaeology conducted an on-line review of
the Archaeological Site Atlas (Atlas) of the
Texas State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO). The purpose of this review was to
identify any listed or potential archaeological
resources within the Area of Potential Effect
(APE) . The review of a modern (2008) aerial
photograph (Figure 2), as well as 12
photographs of the site and surrounding area
revealed that the APE had been used as grazing
land, and had undergone little impact. In
addition, a detailed architectural drawing of the
tower site and access road, a USGS
topographic map, and a USDA soils map of the
proposed project area were reviewed.
Although there were no currently recorded Figure 2. Modern aerial photograph showing
archaeological sites within one kilometer of the the project area location
project area, there had been very few surveys
nearby, and none in the immediate area. The project area is situated north of Cutoff Lake, on
1

what could possibly have been a Holocene terrace along an old meander of the Brazos River, or
one of its primary tributaries. Its location suggested that there was slight to good potential for
cultural materials to exist that could date from the Paleoindian through the late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods (Abbott 2001). The soils within the project area are mapped as Pledger
Clay, with the possibility of containing intact cultural materials as deep as 50 inches (1.5 meters)
below the surface. As such, shovel testing was not considered an acceptable method of testing
the proposed tower site location. Instead, it was recommended that a backhoe trench (or trenches)
be excavated across the footprint of the project area, as well as along any utility and access
rights-of-way.

On January 17th , 209,Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of the
footprint of the proposed impact area, as well as the access and utility right-of way toward Sugar
Mill Lane. In addition to the surface survey, Tierras Antiguas monitored the excavation of two
trackhoe trenches. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and the Texas State Historical
Preservation Office (SHPO). Although no Texas Antiquities Permit was required, this report of
findings was reviewed by the (SHPO).

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area where the cellular tower is located is further illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. It is
situated on Upper Cretaceous-aged (ca. 66 to 142 million years ago) Pecan Gap Chalk, made up
of chalk and chalky marl (Kpg) well over 100 feet (33+ meters) thick (Figure 3). The knoll and
southern slope where the cell tower is located is covered on the surface with what are likely plioPleistocene Uvalde gravels, commonly observed elsewhere in upland areas below the Edwards
Escarpment (e.g., Nickels et al. 1997). Uvalde gravels generally consist of very fine quality
varieties of cherts and quartzites suitable for fashioning stone tools.
As shown in Figure 4, the soil type within the upper, knoll portion of the project area is BrackettAustin complex (Bsc), that is generally shallow, and commonly found on uplands and knolls
throughout the northeastern portion of Bexar County. The southern, lower portion of the project
2

area over which the right-of-way from Wetmore Road extends northward is covered with Austin
silty clay (AuC), that can be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) thick, depending on the upper
slope colluvial deposition and the lower slope alluvium (Taylor et al. 1991). As will be discussed
in the Results section of this report, clay soils were encountered to 5.5 inches (40 centimeters)
on the southern, lower slope of the knoll.

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The project area lies within the Central Texas archaeological region. The most basic chronology
of the Central Texas region can be divided into either: (1) prehistoric cultural groups with no
specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented groups with a designated tribal or band
name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in Texas, the cultural activities
of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited the region can only be surmised
from what we can glean from the archaeological records at undisturbed, and well-documented
sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed firsthand by the Spanish soldiers and priests
beginning in the late 1600s. The Spanish then began recording the names, numbers, and living
conditions of the many groups of Native Americans who lived in the region. However, there is
a significant transition era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups,
and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; the transition era occurs in the
1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.

The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Although other
archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current understanding of
how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), perhaps the most
current and widely recognized chronologies are those offered by Michael Collins (1995).
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800 years ago
(Collins 1995:381–383). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique, fluted, finely flaked, and bladeshaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools chipped on both sides, and unique
prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from river cobbles. Archaeologists have
documented Clovis-age sites in Central Texas such as killsites, quarries, stone tool caches, open
campsites, ritual sites, and burials. A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are
fairly common in Central; however, no campsites or killsites have been found south of Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we term
as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was not
available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their diet
by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central Texas archaeological
sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into what we
commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the Archaic has
further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region surrounding the Swenson Tower site survey area was most probably occupied by
small groups who moved almost constantly during the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists
have observed a distinctive change in projectile point styles that are unique to this period; they
include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched dart points. Although they were still very
much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors
had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive, they capitalized on exploiting the other
abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents,
prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers. Archaeologists point to the increased
numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in cooking ovens larger in size than normal

4

campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as evidence that Native Americans refocused
their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney 1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000 and
4,000 years ago. The climate began changing in Central Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago,
and a continuum of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to
have caused the Native Americans to gather in larger groups to exploit plant foods that were
more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Weir
1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date to this period,
and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous prickly pear tunas
and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer and rabbit
(Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:383).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago)
As with the previously described synthesis of the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits
of Native Americans inhabiting Central Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred
over several hundred years. Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the
environment is questionable. In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites imply that
change may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago, while Hester (1995) believes the Late Archaic traits seen in South Texas
archaeological sites may better be defined as between 2,400–1,300 years ago. The large cooking
ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned rock middens, intensified during the Late
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although the Native Americans of Central Texas still
sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly cooler
and moister climate allowed them to pursue other food goods. Even though by about 1,500 years
ago the gregarious, large herds of bison no longer predominated the now-dwindling grasslands
of Central and South Texas (Dillehay 1974), the Native Americans still hunted and/or gathered
deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).

Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
present-day Austin area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because
of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels
until 1,000± years later (Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’
hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a
noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late Archaic.
During this period, dart points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft
with a dart point attached to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It would not be
until perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for hunting in the
region. Late Archaic dart points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points, and the
most common dart points that are found within the area are what archaeologists call Ensor and
Frio types (Turner and Hester 1999:114,122).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehsitoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same characteristics
that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric assemblages left
behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style. Therefore, some
archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or Transitional Archaic”,
spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years ago - depending on
where in South or Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present archaeological sites
were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number of burned rock
midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date to this time
period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again take
advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g., Mauldin
et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-350 years ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found on
some Late Prehistoric archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct change in
projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years ago. These
stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central region adapted the bow-and-arrow as
a weapon rather than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone
points devised for killing became much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the
smaller, sleeker arrow shafts carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have
found Edwards and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g.,
6

Goode 1991:71). Concurrently, excavations by professional archaeologists have provided
evidence that Native Americans began using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays,
as well as perhaps trading vessels from the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas
regions. As with any successful venture, the making of pottery was refined so that vessels were
used more, and the technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black
1989:32; Hester 1995; Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens that we commonly call “Indian Mounds”, or burned rock middens in which they roasted
tubers, nuts, and some game animals (see for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same
period, the inhabitants may have increased their dependence upon bison (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to South and Central
Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grassiness
in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor”
into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner
1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas during the
Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know that they began occupying the limestone
overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks and rivers cutting into the Balcones
Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters occupied by Native Americans along the
escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina River in Medina County (Highley et al.
1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967),
and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985).
Historic
Primarily beginning slightly over 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today Central Texas in everincreasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic
period in both Central and South Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of
European contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the
region. In Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests
and government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the
indigenous groups. However, South Texas at the time was largely bypassed by early EuroAmericans seeking permanent settlement. As such, the technology and lifestyles of the
indigenous groups in South Texas may have been affected by transient European influence, but
today we can only observe these changes in the archaeological record because the written
accounts simply are not available. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with
recognizing this transitional period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this
largely unknown period as the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1981; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961). In later years, intrusive groups such as the

7

Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the Coahuiltecans
(Hester 1989; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and disrupted
by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in Central
Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the High
Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of the
Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly demoralized
over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused by the forced
continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the world (Bolton
1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if not hundreds of
language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have been lost (e.g.
Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries.
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
tenable peaceful coexistence, in which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow to San
Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun
repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
8

combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836.
Prehistoric Archaeological Site Types That Could be Expected Within or Near the Project
Area
Five types of prehistoric sites normally found in this immediate area of Texas are: (1) open camp
sites, with either single or multiple temporary occupations; (2) burned rock midden sites, with
or without associated camp sites; (3) rock shelters; (4) chert quarry sites; and (5) burial sites.
Open campsites are defined by the presence of firecracked rock (occurring in varying quantities),
rare finished tools, and few thinning flakes or other advanced reduction stage debitage. They
consist of thin lithic scatters representing a single occupation, or deeply stratified, multicomponent sites to which groups repeatedly returned for thousands of years (Black and McGraw
1985; Guderjan et al. 1992).
Burned rock middens are common over central and west Texas, and are commonly referred to
as “Indian Mounds”. They consist of piles of heat-fractured limestone, usually in a conical pile
but occasionally in rings or U-shapes. These piles can measure tens of meters in diameter with
a meter or more depth. Although they are usually near water sources, the exact nature of the
activities at these sites is still a matter of debate. Nevertheless, most researchers agree that they
are probably the result of intensive use of some resource in a logistically oriented subsistence
strategy (Creel 1986; Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Rockshelters are found in solution cavities along creeks where water has cut into limestone
bedrock. Repeated use of these shelters by prehistoric and historic populations is documented
throughout Texas. Rockshelters are common along creeks cutting through the Balcones
Escarpment.
Chert quarry and procurement sites can occur at outcroppings of limestone containing numerous
chert nodules, while other areas have large numbers of chert nodules that have been washed into
stream beds. Within the project area, extensive chert gravels are visible along Culebra Creek.
Lithic quarries and procurement sites (gravel outcrops) are always set in exposed gravel sheets
of varying sizes, and contain related artifacts - such as tested cobbles, cores, exterior and interior
flakes, and rarely finished tools. When firecracked rock is present on quarry/workshops the site
is considered a camp and procurement location. Quarry/procurement sites usually have a great
deal of primary and secondary flakes, cores, tested cobbles, and large numbers of roughed-out
bifaces or quarry blanks, many broken during manufacture (Potter et al. 1992).
Prehistoric burials may be found in Bexar County. Usually, single burials occur at occupation
sites, but the Native Americans began burying their dead in prehistoric cemeteries in the Late
Archaic, and archaeologists have discovered more of them in the Late Prehistoric (e.g., Prewitt
1981). Although associated grave goods are rare, they certainly are present (e.g., Taylor and
Highley 1995), and suggest a ceremonial respect for beliefs in the hereafter. Occasionally,

9

especially during the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period cemeteries, evidence of conflict
appears with apparent arrow wound fatalities (e.g., Prewitt 1974).

Project Goals and Methods

Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the Central
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods
The Survey
Prior to the archaeological survey, the
area of the knoll and lower slope to be
further impacted had been staked with
survey stakes, thus clearly delineating
Figure 5. Right-of-way from cell tower toward
the area to be further disturbed. In
Wetmore Road (facing south).
10

Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the delineated
tract was conducted.
Scattered modern trash covered portions of the
project area, and bladed push piles were
evident along both the sloping right-of-way
northward from Wetmore Road, as well as
around the diameter of the cell tower site on the
knoll’s apex (Figures 5 and 6).

A total of six shovel tests were placed
within the APE footprint (Figures 7 and
8). Shovel tests were dug in 10-cm levels,
and all sediments were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh.
Following a designed research plan, any
artifacts recovered from shovel tests were
not to be collected, but were to be placed
in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled
shovel test.
However, in the end, no artifacts were
observed either on the surface or within
any of the shovel tests. Nevertheless, the
results of shovel testing were fully
documented on Shovel Test forms.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the
project area was conducted, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was
found. In addition, no cultural materials were found in any of the six shovel tests excavated.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
13

archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
