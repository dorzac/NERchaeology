ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey of a 0.59 square mile area (375 acres) within
the Caney Ranger District of the Kisatchie National Forest in central Webster Parish,
Louisiana was conducted by Dixie Environmental Services Co., LP (DESCO) under the
direction of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA), the holder of the Archeological
Resources Protection Act (ARPA) permit. The project commenced on August 16, 2008
and ended on August 18, 2008. The investigations consisted of a file search for known
sites within the project area prior to the field survey and visual inspections and shovel
tests at the 73 pre-determined source point locations. No previously recorded
prehistoric sites or historic sites are known to be located within the project area, and no
new sites were found as a result of this study.

INTRODUCTION
Cross Bayou Exploration of Shreveport, Louisiana is conducting a 3-D seismic
survey that encompasses portions of the Caney Ranger District of the Kisatchie
National Forest in central Webster Parish (Figure 1). The purpose of the seismic survey
is to provide a high-resolution image of the subsurface geological features that will allow
the client to effectively evaluate the hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area.
The survey requires the deployment of motion sensing devices (receivers) at regular
intervals along receiver lines as well as the incorporation of energy sources at regular
intervals along source lines. As proposed, there are 73 source points within the
Kisatchie National Forest. Since the project area is on federal land, the Section 106
process was initiated, and an Archeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) permit
was required.
Prior to allowing the seismic survey to proceed, an archaeological investigation of
the portion of the project area within the National Forest was required by the United
States Forest Service. In order to comply with this request, DESCO was retained to
ensure that this task was successfully performed. DESCO contracted with BVRA to
perform the archaeological survey and write a report that will satisfy the Forest Service
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) of the state of Louisiana. The
archaeological project area is located within Compartment 21 of the Caney Unit of the
Caney Ranger District, the smallest and most northerly of the districts in the Kisatchie
National Forest. The Caney Ranger District consists of three discontinuous tracts in
Claiborne and Webster parishes and is 32,371 acres in size. BVRA conducted a file
search for all known resources within the project area and performed archaeological
investigations at each of the 73 source point locations within the National Forest portion
of the project area. This report documents these efforts. The area investigated by the
archaeological field crew is depicted on the 7.5’ United States Geological Survey
topographic quadrangle Minden North (32093-F3) (Figure 2). All records generated by
this project have been submitted to the Forest Service Supervisor’s Office in Pineville,
Louisiana for curation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information was taken from an in-house report by Brian Cockrell
and Velicia Bergstrom (2008) and a report of Land Resource Regions and Major Land
Resource Areas of the United States by the United States Department of Agriculture
(2006). The project area is located within Major Land Resource Area 133B as defined
by the United States Department of Agriculture and is part of the West Gulf Coastal
Plain Section of the Coastal Plain Province of the Atlantic Plain. This area consists of
level to steep uplands that are intricately dissected by streams, some of which have
broad floodplains. The average annual precipitation in this area is 39 to 63 inches, and
most of the rainfall occurs in late summer and fall. The average annual temperature is
61 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and the freeze-free period averages 270 days. Water is
generally abundant in the area due to precipitation, perennial streams, and the supply of
ground water. Bedrock aquifers are the main source of ground water.
The Caney Ranger District consists of lands that, for the most part, have been
restored to forest from pre-existing sugar cane and cotton fields. Land use in this Major
Land Resource Area is for the production of timber and pulpwood. Figure 3 illustrates
the wooded nature of the project area. The terrain throughout the Caney Ranger
District is typical of a dissected plateau and is bounded on the east by the Ouachita
River floodplain and on the west by the floodplain of Bayou Dorcheat. Streams
commonly have steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys. Vegetation is predominantly pine
and oak/hickory. The dominant trees in this Major Land Resource Area are loblolly
pine, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, southern red oak, white oak, flowering dogwood, and
post oak. The area generally slopes southward toward the Gulf of Mexico. Formations
range from the Claiborne of the Eocene in the northern part of the state to the Jackson,
Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, and Terrace formations of the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene and
Pleistocene, respectively (Hough 1959). In general, the dominant order of soils in this
Major Land Resource Area are Alifsols and Ultisols. Typically, they are deep, well
drained to poorly drained, and loamy or clayey. There are two soil associations with in
the survey area. They are Darley gravelly loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (Da)
and Darley gravelly loamy fine sand, 5 to 12 percent slopes (DE).
Da soils are typically found at an elevation of 200 to 450 feet on the shoulder or
summit of interfluves. The parent material is an iron-rich clayey fluviomarine deposit.
This soil is well drained, has a low available water capacity (about 3.9 inches), does not
flood, and the depth to the water table is more than 80 inches. A typical profile of this
soil type is gravelly loamy fine sand (0 to 10 inches), clay (10 to 44 inches), and sandy
clay loam (44 to 65 inches).

DE soils are typically found at an elevation of 200 to 450 feet on the shoulder or
summit of interfluves. The parent material is an iron-rich clayey fluviomarine deposit.
This soil is well drained, has a low available water capacity (about 3.8 inches), does not
flood, and the depth to the water table is more than 80 inches. A typical profile of this
soil type is gravelly loamy fine sand (0 to 12 inches), sandy clay (12 to 30 inches), clay
(30 to 50 inches), and fine sandy loam (50 to 65 inches).

PREHISTORIC CULTURE SEQUENCE
Paleoindian Period
It is believed by most archaeologists that human populations may have entered
North America as early as 10,000 B.C. There is archaeological evidence that large,
now-extinct animals such as mammoth and mastodon were hunted in other parts of
North America by Paleoindians using distinct projectile points that are known today as
Clovis and Folsom. When examples of these types are found in northwestern Louisiana
they are usually recovered as surface finds from eroded surfaces or areas with no firm
context that can associate them with other artifacts. According to Gagliano and Gregory
(1965), most Paleoindian sites in Louisiana are found on Pleistocene terraces where
erosion has exposed surface remains. They state that surface materials at these sites
are generally sparse, suggesting limited use and short-term occupations compatible
with a hunting and gathering life style. According to Cockrell and Bergstrom (2008),
sites dating to this period are few in number and have been identified on lands owned
by the National Forest. No Paleoindian sites have been recorded in the vicinity of the
current project area. Another point type often associated with the Paleoindian period is
San Patrice. This type has been found at sites with good context and is believed by
some archaeologists to belong to the Early Archaic Period or a transitional period
between Paleoindian times and the beginning of the Archaic Period. At site 16GR58 in
Grant Parish, Keller (1981) found a grinding stone and a San Patrice point in what
appeared to be a direct association. Other diagnostic artifacts of the Paleoindian Period
in Louisiana are the Dalton point and Albany scraper (Cockrell and Bergstrom 2008).
This period may have lasted until circa 8000 B.C.
Archaic Period
The Archaic period began in Louisiana circa 8000 B.C., and it represented a time
when the environment was changed by post-glacial weather conditions. Also during this
time populations increased in size, even though groups remained small in number.
Caldwell (1958) believes that a pattern of shifting occupation and specialized resource
utilization based on seasonal availability occurred during the Early Archaic. He refers to
this as “primary forest efficiency.” Artifacts associated with the Archaic Period in
Louisiana include ground stone tools (celts), grinding stones, nutting or pitted anvil
stones, drills, abraders, and stemmed projectile points made from local materials
(Cockrell and Bergstrom 2008). Projectile points assigned to the Early Archaic in
Louisiana include Edgewood and Yarborough (Servello 1983). Perino (1968) reports
points identical to the Palmer type have been found at sites in Louisiana. The Early
Archaic Period lasted from circa 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. No Early Archaic Period sites
have been reported in the current project area.
* Much of the following information was taken from a Management Summary prepared
by Brian Cockrell and Velicia Bergstrom (2008) with their permission.

The Middle Archaic lasted from circa 6000 B.C. to 3000 B.C. and is best known
in Louisiana in the southern and southeastern areas of the state, mainly along the
central coast and the Amite River. This period is typified by the beginning of mound
construction and stone artifacts such as celts, atlatl weights (bannerstones), and axes.
Projectile point styles included corner-notched and stemmed types (Evans, Williams,
and Lange). No Middle Archaic sites have been reported in the current project area.
The last manifestation of the Archaic in Louisiana (Late Archaic Period) began
circa 3000 B.C. and ended about 1500 B.C. This terminal Archaic period is best
represented in Louisiana in the extreme eastern portion of the state. Artifacts typically
associated with this period are steatite (soapstone) vessels, and projectile point types
such as Gary, Kent, Ellis, Ensor, Motley, Marcos, Morhiss, and Palmillas. According to
Cockrell and Bergstrom (2008), Archaic sites in the Kisatchie National Forest are best
known from excavations at 16GR58 (Keller 1981), 16VN24 (Guderjan and Moorehead
1983), 16VN80 (Servello 1983), and 16VN338, 16VN340, and 16VN396 (Cantley and
Kern 1984). No Late Archaic sites have been reported in close proximity to the current
project area.
Poverty Point Culture
The culture known as Poverty Point began in Louisiana about 1500 B.C. and
lasted until 500 B.C. It is regarded by many archaeologists as the “earliest relatively
complex cultural organization in Louisiana.” The Poverty Point site (16WC5) is located
in northeastern Louisiana and contains semi-circular ridges and mounds of earthen
construction, and it was likely the hub of a vast trade network (Gibson 1980). Clay
cooking balls and an exotic lapidary industry which includes stone figurines, beads,
pendants, and microlithic tools represents the technology of Poverty Point culture
(Webb 1982). It was also the time when ceramics first appeared. Types associated
with Poverty Point culture include the fiber-tempered Wheeler series, sand-tempered
Alexander wares, and Tchefuncte ceramics. No sites dating to this period are present
in the Caney Ranger District.

7

Tchefuncte Period
This culture lasted from 500 B.C. until approximately A.D. 1 and was first defined
by Ford and Quimby (1945). Settlements belonging to this culture were small,
scattered, and located mainly in slack water environments of slow-moving streams,
floodplain lakes, and littoral zones (Toth 1988). Subsistence during the Tchula Period
was based on collecting plant foods and shellfish as well as hunting. Pottery use
became widespread during this time, and these vessels would have improved food
storage capabilities. Diagnostic pottery styles include decorative techniques of punchand-drag incising and laminated paste, apparently the result of the absence of any
tempering agent. Conical burial mounds are often found at inland sites (Shenkel 1984).
Gibson (1968) proposed a north Louisiana Tchefuncte phase in the stream valleys of
Little River and the Ouachita River. The Russell Landing phase was later identified in
the Red River mouth area (Phillips 1970). Archaeological sites containing evidence of
Tchefuncte culture are scarce in central and northwestern Louisiana, but ceramics from
this period have been reported at sites in southern Natchitoches Parish (Campbell et al.
1980). Material recovered from these sites included Orleans Punctated and Lake
Borgne Incised sherds in association with of Pontchartrain projectile points. Cockrell
and Bergsrom (2008) believe that the Evangeline, southern Catahoula, Kisatchie, and
Vernon Ranger districts have potential for Tchefuncte occupations. Few definite
Tchefuncte sites have been found in the Kisatchie National Forest, and not one is in
close proximity to the current project area.
Marksville Period
The Marksville culture followed Tchefuncte and lasted until A.D. 400. According
to Cockrell and Bergstrom (2008), it appears to be Louisiana’s manifestation of the
Hopewell culture that diffused from Ohio and Illinois. Toth (1988) describes the northern
Hopewellian influence as ephemeral contacts affecting mortuary practices and ceramic
decoration of Lower Valley peoples, but having little or no effect on subsistence
strategies. Subsistence continued to be based primarily upon collecting and hunting
with an increased emphasis upon horticulture and incipient agriculture. Settlements
appear large, almost permanent, and tended to be located on the terraces of major
streams. Marksville ceramics decorated with geometric and effigy designs are traceable
to the Illinois Valley peoples. Furthermore, burial mound construction containing lavish
offerings of copper, rare minerals and other objects point to elaborate mortuary
practices and a significant trade and exchange network (Neuman 1984). Sites dating to
this period are rare in the Kisatchie National Forest. A single Marksville sherd typed as
Marksville Incised, variety Marksville was found at site 16GR495 within the Catahoula
Ranger district (Mayer 1993). Sites containing Marksville occupations have been found
nearby, including the Whatley site (16GR37) (Thomas and Campbell 1978) and Clear
Creek Bay (16GR20) (Keller et al. 1983). Marksville villages with associated mounds
have also been reported from the Cane River Basin (Gregory and Curry 1978; Campbell
et al. 1980) near the Kisatchie District. Marksville pottery was found during a recent
survey in the Winn Ranger District (Moore et al. 2008).
8

Baytown Period
Baytown has been the focus of much debate by archaeologists, and it is used
synonymously by some with Marksville, Troyville, and Coles Creek (Phillips et al. 1951).
It is known, however, that this period marks the advent of the bow and arrow, platform
mounds constructed for mortuary purposes, and a subsistence strategy based on
intensive collection of riverine sources (Belmont 1984). Interaction with the early
Weeden Island culture of the Florida coast is evident through ceramic styles such as
human effigy vessels, animal rim effigies, red slipping, and red-and-white painting that
indicate ties to the east (Williams and Brain 1983; Belmont 1984). Baytown sites
containing such ceramics are scarce in the uplands of the Kisatchie National Forest, but
surface scatters of red-filmed ceramics have been found on virtually every district. A
recent survey recovered numerous grog-tempered sherds in the Winn Ranger District
that are typically associated with the Baytown culture (Moore et al. 2008).
Coles Creek
This culture lasted from circa A.D. 700 to A.D. 1000 and was widespread in the
state of Louisiana. It is a well-defined complex that was first defined on the basis of its
ceramic assemblage that includes incised, punctuated, and stamped decorative modes
largely restricted to the upper portion of vessels (Brown 1984). The culture is also
identified by small “sub-structural mounds” around plazas (Williams and Brain 1983).
Coles Creek development appears to have been centered in the Tensas Basin and
remained limited, although pervasive in the lower half of the Lower Mississippi Valley
(Brown 1984). An increase in the number of settlements and socio-religious centers
during this time may be resultant of the combined effectiveness of agriculture and the
bow and arrow (Williams and Brain 1983). A major site of this period just east of the
Catahoula Ranger District is the Clear Creek Bay site (16GR20). This is a major Coles
Creek occupation with three large mounds (Keller and Campbell 1983). Four smaller
mounds were also reported to be associated with this site. Other examples are known
along Saline Bayou and near Little River. According to Brian Cockrell (personal
communication, August 27, 2008), sites belonging to this culture are present in the
Kisatchie National Forest. Ceramics identified as Coles Creek were recovered during a
recent survey in the Winn Ranger District (Moore et al. 2008).
Mississippian Period
Between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1000 agricultural based chiefdom societies in the
area of the confluences of the Missouri and Ohio rivers began to disseminate their ideas
and technologies. The introduction of shell tempering, an emphasis on truncate mound
construction, and placement of mound centers near rivers are major influences of this
culture (Steponaitis 1986). This culture is represented by major centers at Moundville in
Alabama, Etowah in Georgia, and throughout most of the southeastern United States.
Two regional variations developed in Louisiana, but no Mississippian sites are known
within the Kisatchie National Forest. Shell-tempered pottery was found in the Winn
Ranger District during a recent survey (Moore et al. 2008).
9

Plaquemine Culture
Plaquemine is viewed by Phillips (1970) as an outgrowth of the Coles Creek
culture that began around A.D. 1000, and sites of this period are found throughout much
of Louisiana. Williams and Brain (1983) interpret the culture to be a less complete
Mississippian influence or “cultural hybridization” of Coles Creek and Mississippian
cultures. The Plaquemine Culture is characterized by monumental ceremonial centers,
complex political systems, and an art style with graphic symbolism. Evidence of
Plaquemine occupations in the Kisatchie National Forest is rare. It has been suggested
by Keller (1983) that the Forest lies within an area of central Louisiana that may have
acted as a buffer zone between the Caddoan groups in the northwestern part of the
state and Plaquemine groups to the southeast. Gregory et al. (1987) argue that the
Plaquemine population in the Lower Red River Valley, especially the Catahoula Lake
basin, experienced a Caddoan influence. This culture lasted through the early part of
the Historic Period. No Plaquemine sites are known to exist in or near the project area.
Caddo Culture
The Caddo culture began in the northwestern part of Louisiana about A.D. 900,
lasted until historic times, and is marked by the emergence of a decorative style of
pottery such as globular wares with dark, polished surfaces and angled rims. Exteriors
were decorated with engraved curvilinear designs. Ceremonial centers with mounds
and central plazas that had emerged during the Coles Creek Period continued in
Caddoan Culture (Cockrell and Bergstrom 2008). Caddoan cultural development
appears to have been one of complex changes characterized by the oscillation of
chiefdoms that apparently reintegrated in tribal confederacies by historic times (Cantley
and Kern 1984). However, there is debate as to how Caddoan culture developed and
under what influence. Caddoan settlement patterns in the Red River bottom area
tended to consist of villages along secondary streams with clusters of smaller sites
located in peripheral floodplain settings (Girard 1997). Research at Fort Polk suggests
that the Caddoan settlement pattern in the Red River Valley did not occur in the upland
settings of the Fort (Thomas, et al. 1992). This appears to be the case on much of the
area that is now Kisatchie National Forest. Caddoan sites, although not abundant,
occur in most districts of the Kisatchie National Forest. Present evidence suggests that
small bands of Caddo, probably represented by nuclear family or extended family
groups, moved into the area of the Forest along the larger interior drainages (Cockrell
and Bergstrom 2008). Caddoan pottery was found in the Winn Ranger district during a
recent survey by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore et al. 2008).

10

HISTORIC PERIOD
In 1690, Henri de Tonti encountered the Natchitoches, a Caddoan tribe, while
searching for the LaSalle Expedition in the area of the present town of Natchitoches in
northwest Louisiana (Webb and Gregory 1978). His exploration of the Red River Valley
provides historians with some of the earliest and best accounts of the area. Other
historic Caddo groups in Louisiana at the time of contact included the Adaes, Doustioni,
Natchitoches, Ouachita, and Yatasi who were primarily concentrated around the present
towns of Natchitoches, Mansfield, Monroe, and Robeline. The Natchitoches and other
Caddoan groups were visited in 1700 by Jean Baptiste Lemoine de Bienville who
returned the next year with Louis Juchereau St. Denis while seeking markets for trade
(Swanton 1911; Gregory 1974). Bienville’s contacts led to French settlement and trade
with Caddoan and other groups in the following years. The Caddo survived the political
and economic conflicts between the French and Spanish, but American government
Indian policies after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 brought drastic changes, and they
were eventually removed to Oklahoma in 1835 (Gregory 1974). Although the French
had been in Louisiana since 1682, the first permanent settlement in the state was
established at Natchitoches in 1714. In an effort to counter the French threat at Fort St.
Jean Baptiste aux Natchitoches, the Spanish established the presidio and mission
Neustra Senora del Pilar de Los Adaes west of Natchitoches (Bolton 1962).
There were several confrontations between the settlers, soldiers, and local Indian
groups in the early part of the 18th century. In 1720, Diron Dartaguette (Inspector of
Louisiana troops) reported attacks by the Chicachas (Chickasaw) Indians on travelers
delayed at "Grand Rapid." Post du Rapides was established in 1722 at present-day
Pineville in order to protect travelers on their way to Natchitoches. However, the
greatest conflict between the French and Indians in this area occurred in 1729 when the
Natchez, enraged by French incursions in the Mississippi Valley, attacked Fort Rosalie
in present-day Natchez, Mississippi. The Natchez warriors killed 250 men and took 300
women and children prisoner (Utley and Washburn 1977). The French and their
Choctaw allies retaliated and destroyed the Natchez village. The Natchez then fled into
Louisiana and were virtually destroyed outside Natchitoches by combined French and
Indian forces (Swanton 1952). The Natchez then broke up and dispersed into areas as
far away as the Carolinas (Milling 1969).
Disputes over territories in the New World resulted in military action by European
powers during the eighteenth century. France and England fought each other beginning
in 1754 during the French and Indian War. By 1756, the conflict had spread to Europe
(Taylor 1975). Spain became embroiled in the conflict toward the end of the war after
agreeing to an alliance with France. Despite Spain’s support, the French were forced to
seek peace with England because of mounting losses and costs. France ceded
Louisiana to Spain in 1762 by the Treaty of Fountainebleu as compensation for losses
incurred during the war, if not to rid her of a colony that posed economic strains on the
French government (Taylor 1975).
11

The war ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris. There are several tracts of land
now within the confines of the Kisatchie National Forest that are documented as once
being part of Spanish Land Grants. One such site, the Old Spanish Oak site (16NA380),
was discovered in 1988 in conjunction with heritage survey pursuant to a timber sale. At
that time it was noted as containing intact surface deposits (Dorian 1988) and a
semicircular line of six over-mature live oaks. Local tradition allowed that part of Section
33 was once a Spanish Land Grant; thus, the name Spanish Oak site. Forest Service
land acquisition records do not reflect this tradition. The Government Land Office (GLO)
map of July 1832 shows that Township 6 North, Range 7 West, Section 33 as a
standard section. And yet, one cannot over look the fact that these older oaks were
purposely planted and the local reports of colonial occupation (Dorian 1988).
Spain ceded Louisiana back to France with the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of
1800. The United States viewed any foreign control of the Mississippi River as
detrimental to its survival. Thus, the United States initiated talks with France for the
purchase of New Orleans. Negotiations lasted for months until France unexpectedly
offered to sell the entire Louisiana colony. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 gave
control of the Mississippi to the United States while doubling its geographical area
(Taylor 1975). The population increased greatly following the United States taking
possession of the Louisiana colony. With the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 and the
process of sugar granulation, plantation agriculture became the dominant economy.
Small landholders were eventually pushed out of the fertile alluvial valleys into the
surrounding Pine Hills. The activities of the Union forces in the area destroyed much of
the local property as well as the general economy, which became stagnated and did not
revive until the 1890s when emphasis was placed on the lumber industry. Central
Louisiana became a major lumbering center that resulted in the development of a
number of sawmills in the area. By the 1930s, the "cut and get out" logging methods
left vast areas of cutover lands. As mills ran out of wood and employment in the lumber
industry began to close, subsistence farming began to increase. The United States
government purchased much of the cutover land leading to reforestation and the
creation of the Kisatchie National Forest (Burns 1981). In 1933, President Theodore
Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The successful intent was to
employ thousands of young men during peacetime to battle against destruction and
erosion of our natural resources. Louisiana certainly had their share of CCC camps,
some of which are now a part of the Kisatchie National Forest. With the outbreak of
World War II, the Kisatchie National Forest played a vital role in the training of United
States troops. The United States Army was authorized the use of a total of 95,315
acres for the establishment of Camp Polk at the Vernon District, Camp Livingston
(16RA360) and the Breezy Hill Artillery Range at the Catahoula District, Camp
Claiborne (16RA373) at the Evangeline District, and a number of bombing ranges on
the Caney, Catahoula, Winn, and Evangeline Districts (Burns 1981). Although the Air
Force still maintains a bombing range on the Evangeline District and Fort Polk currently
utilizes a portion of the Vernon District, Camps Claiborne and Livingston were
abandoned at the close of the war, and the buildings were salvaged. These areas are
now covered in forest, but the remains of the structural foundations are still present.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
It is beyond the scope of this report of negative findings to document all work
performed in Webster Parish by professional archaeologists. According to Cockrell and
Bergstrom (2008), systematic surveys or inventories of the Kisatchie National Forest did
not begin until the late 1970s. The first professional investigation was performed under
the supervision of Hiram P. Gregory in the Kisatchie Ranger District in 1972 (Gregory
and Curry 1972). In 1976, Forest Service archaeologists began surveying areas
planned for forest-related projects such as timber harvests and land exchanges. These
surveys were conducted between 1977 and 1982 under the guidance of Forest
Archaeologist John Keller, Ph.D. Since that time, Forest Service archaeologists have
conducted numerous surveys in the Caney Ranger District and recorded approximately
200 sites. These surveys have been preformed pursuant to ground disturbing activities
such as timber harvesting, salvage timber operations (tornado damage), and/or the
construction of wildlife ponds. The work by Forest Service archaeologists were reported
in individual documents referred to as a Management Summary, and these summaries
are on file at the Kisatchie National Forest offices in Pineville and Homer. The current
survey is the first to be conducted in the Caney Ranger District by a private contract
firm. Not all prehistoric time periods represented in Louisiana have been documented in
the Caney Ranger District, but artifacts associated with Paleoindian, Archaic, Marksville,
Baytown, Coles Creek, and Caddoan cultures have been recovered in this area. These
sites include lithic scatters, campsites, and mounds. Historic sites in the Caney Ranger
District date to the latter part of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century
and include farmsteads, homesteads, a lookout tower, roads and trams, a CCC site,
trash dumps, and cemeteries. Also present are many areas where a maximum of four
artifacts were recovered, and these localities are classified as isolated finds according
to criteria established by the State Historic Preservation Officer for Louisiana. Many of
the in-house surveys were in low probability areas where archaeological sites are not
present.
The nearest cultural resources survey to the current project area was conducted
by Timothy Phillips, a staff archaeologist working for the Kisatchie National Forest in
1986 (Phillips and Willingham 1986). This survey was conducted prior to logging
operations, and two historic sites (16WE206 and 16WE207) were recorded, both
outside the current project area. Site 16WE206 contains a prehistoric component
(flakes and a distally retouched artifact) and a historic component consisting of
earthenware sherds, glass fragments, and a snuff bottle fragment. This site is 690
meters to the north and west of the nearest source point in the current project area.
Site 16WE207 is described on the site form as a house site dating from the late 19th to
the early 20th century. It produced earthenware sherds, a brown-glazed crockery sherd,
bottle fragments, snuff bottle fragments (amber glass), porcelain fragments, one saltglazed crockery sherd, and two polychrome sherds. This site is 170 meters southwest
of the nearest source point in the current project area.

Although small area surveys have been conducted in the general area, only one
major study has been carried out within one mile of the current project area. A typical,
large-scale survey in the Caney Ranger District was performed in 2008 prior to a timber
sale and involved an investigation of a 1554-acre tract scattered across the Caney Unit
of the forest. This project was performed under the supervision of District Archaeologist
Brian Cockrell and a crew consisting of four professional archaeologists, ten Heritage
Resource Technicians, and eleven personnel with no training in archaeological survey.
As a result of this endeavor, nine historic sites (16WE185, 16WE378, 16WE386,
16WE379, 16WE387, 16WE380, 16WE381, and 16WE383) and two prehistoric sites
(16WE388 and 16WE382) were recorded. Additionally, twenty-six isolated finds were
documented. The majority of these sites offer no research potential, and they are not
recommended for protection.
According to Brian Cockrell, Forest Service personnel have conducted 42 cultural
resource surveys in the Caney Unit of the Caney Ranger District between 1986 and
2008 under the supervision of Timothy G. Phillips, Charles G. Willingham, Larry Haikey,
Velicia Bergstrom, and Brian Cockrell. The vast majority was related to timber sales. As
a result of these investigations, 3112 acres were examined and only twenty-six
prehistoric and historic sites were recorded. That is one site per every 119.69 acres.

METHODS
John C. Hogg visited United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) District
Archeologist Brian Cockrell and checked his maps and files for previously recorded
sites in the project area. Since the offices of the Louisiana Division of Archaeology
were closed due to Hurricane Ike, this agency was not visited. The formal survey was
conducted by John C. Hogg and Phil Bishop on August 16-18, 2008. Each source point
location was visually inspected, and most (n=66) were shovel tested. The excavated
shovel test fill was screened using ¼” hardware cloth. No shovel tests were excavated
in roads or on steep slopes. The results of the investigations were written on a “Log of
Source Points Investigated” (Appendix I), and the location of each source point was
depicted on topographic maps (Appendix II). Shovel tests were terminated when they
reached one meter in depth, sterile clay, bedrock, or standing water. Tests varied in
depth from 10 cm to 70 cm with the majority being terminated between 30 cm and 60
cm. Only four tests were dug to depths greater than 59 cm. Source Points Investigated
forms, printed on acid-free paper, were completed for each test and included the
following information: (1) seismic grid coordinates, (2) depth of each shovel test, and (3)
type of soil present. Edward P. Baxter, Consulting Archaeologist, managed the field
survey and prepared project area maps depicting the general location of the project
area, the boundaries of the project area, and two maps depicting the 73 source points
visited. The archaeological survey crew followed an access route flagged by the
surveyors and visually inspected the areas between source points. Each source point
location was identified by a wooden lathe with the source point number marked on it.
The surveyors provided ArcView shape files of the source point locations. There will be
no additional ground disturbing activities other than the deployment of sensing devices
within the project area that will affect historic properties.
Following the field survey, an avoidance plan (Appendix I) was prepared and
submitted to the USDA in order to allow the drillers to receive permission to begin
drilling while the formal report was being prepared. Following completion of all fieldwork,
copies of the draft report were submitted to the Louisiana Division of Archaeology and
the Kisatchie National Forest for review. All comments from these agencies were
addressed in this final report, and the requisite number of final reports were delivered to
all concerned parties. The Principal Investigator is the first author and is responsible for
preparing a report that will satisfy the Kisatchie National Forest and the Louisiana
SHPO. All records generated by this project have been submitted to the Forest Service
Supervisor’s Office in Pineville, Louisiana for curation.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at the Caney Ranger District, Kisatchie National Forest revealed
no previously recorded sites in the project area. Two previously recorded sites were found
to be in the vicinity of the 73 source point locations. They are 16WE206 and 16WE207.
These are a multi-component site (16WE206) containing a prehistoric lithic scatter and
an early 20th century historic scatter on a large knoll on a west trending ridge spur and a
scatter of historic artifacts dating from the late 19th century through the early 20th century
(16WE207) on a northwest tending ridge spur above a tributary of Caney Creek. The
nearest seismic activity to site 16WE206 is 690 meters, and the nearest seismic activity
to 16WE207 is 170 meters. All shovel tests were negative, and no prehistoric or historic
sites were found as a result of this survey. Based on previous work in the Caney Unit of
the Caney Ranger District, the current project area is viewed as a low probability area
for archaeological sites.

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no previously recorded archaeological sites were found to be within the
project area and no sites were identified during the survey, it is believed that Cross
Bayou Exploration’s seismic activity within the area covered under the ARPA permit for
this project will have not impact upon any cultural resources. Therefore, no further
archaeological investigations are necessary within the project area of potential effect
(APE) Monitoring is also not considered to be necessary since the client has stated that
there are no plans to move or add any source points during the seismic survey.
