Abstract
The City of San Antonio contracted PBS&J to perform cultural resources investigations of their
proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project in San Antonio, Bexar County. The
project will modify Zarzamora Creek from Laven Drive to a distance of approximately 590 meters
(m) (1,600 feet [ft]) upstream of Culebra Road. Impacts will consist of modifications to the creek’s
existing channel, the addition of sanitary sewer improvements, and a tree planting strip. The
project’s length will total 975 m (3,200 ft), and its width will range between approximately 76.2 m
(250 ft) and 152.4 m (500 ft), resulting in an area of approximately 27.5 acres (11.1 hectares [ha]).
An additional 30 acres (12.1 ha) south of Zarzamora Creek may be used for access roads and
temporary staging areas.
Archeological investigations included intensive pedestrian survey and geoarcheological trenching
of approximately 10.4 acres (4.2 ha), resulting in a total of 13 shovel tests and 6 backhoe trenches.
All proved negative for cultural materials. Due to historic dumping and filling, no investigations
were conducted within the area of potential effect south of Zarzamora Creek. It is recommended
that no further archeological investigation is necessary and that construction of the proposed
drainage improvements be allowed to proceed.

Management Summary
PBS&J was contracted by the City of San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, to perform a cultural
resources study for the proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project. The
project will modify Zarzamora Creek from Laven Drive to a distance of approximately 590 meters
(m) (1,600 feet [ft]) upstream of Culebra Road. Impacts will consist of modifications to the creek’s
existing channel and the addition of sanitary sewer improvements and a tree planting strip. The
project’s length will total 975 m (3,200 ft), and its width will range between approximately 76.2 m
(250 ft) and 152.4 m (500 ft), resulting in an area of approximately 27.5 acres (11.1 hectares [ha]).
An additional 30 acres (12.1 ha) south of Zarzamora Creek may be used for access roads and
temporary staging areas.
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5488 was obtained from the Texas Historical Commission, and the
work was conducted by Principal Investigator Mike Smith and Casey Hanson, who performed the
intensive pedestrian survey on January 12, 2010. Robert Rogers, PBS&J geoarcheologist, and Mike
Smith conducted backhoe trenching on January 21, 2010, assisted by Angel Lopez and Jesse Estrada
of Jerdon Enterprise, L.P.
No cultural resources investigations were conducted south of Zarzamora Creek due to historic
dumping and filling, which extended into the Cretaceous soils below. Environmental testing of this
portion of the project area was performed by Medina Consulting Company, Inc., on January 20 and
21, 2010.

I. INTRODUCTION
The City of San Antonio (COSA) contracted PBS&J to perform cultural resources investigations of
their proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project in San Antonio, Bexar
County, Texas (Figure 1). The project will modify Zarzamora Creek from Laven Drive to a distance
of approximately 590 meters (m) (1,600 feet [ft]) upstream of Culebra Road (Figure 2). Impacts will
consist of modifications to the creek’s existing channel and the addition of sanitary sewer
improvements and a tree planting strip. The project’s length will total 975 m (3,200 ft), and its
width will range between approximately 76.2 m (250 ft) and 152.4 m (500 ft), resulting in an area
of approximately 27.5 acres (11.1 hectares [ha]). An additional 30 acres (12.1 ha) south of
Zarzamora Creek may be used for access roads and temporary staging areas.
The project is located on lands owned by COSA, a subdivision of the State of Texas, thereby
requiring compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC) of 1977, as revised through 1995
(Texas Natural Resource Code: Title 9, Chapter 191). Furthermore, because it would include
substantial modification of portions of Zarzamora Creek, the project would require a Clean Water
Act Section 404 Individual Permit, thereby necessitating compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
The cultural resources investigations included both intensive pedestrian survey and
geoarcheological trenching. These investigations were designed to (1) locate and record all
archeological resources present within environmentally safe portions of the project area, (2)
preliminarily assess their eligibility status for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL), and (3) provide site‐specific
recommendations for all NRHP‐ or SAL‐eligible sites or sites with an unknown eligibility status. Due
to the project’s negative results, they are presented below using the Council of Texas Archeologists’
Short Report Format.

II. DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed project area is located in northwest San Antonio along Zarzamora Creek. Zarzamora
Creek has its headwaters approximately 8 kilometers (km) (5 miles) north of the project area. It
flows in a south‐southeasterly direction, having its confluence with the San Antonio River about
11.2 km (7 miles) southeast of the project area. Soils in the area are mapped as belonging to the
Trinity and Frio series (undifferentiated). Both Trinity and Frio soils are taxonomically classified as
Vertisols, and formed in recent calcareous alluvium (Taylor et al. 1962). These are frequently
flooded and thus harbor the potential for buried cultural resources. Soils of the Houston series of
black gravelly clay lie along the margins of the project area. These developed in uplands over the
calcareous clay and marl of the Upper Cretaceous‐aged Taylor and Navarro formations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974), and are thus presumed to have low potential for intact cultural surfaces.
The floodplain of Zarzamora Creek is approximately 152 m (500 ft) wide in the project area (Figure
3). According to a local informant, Angel Lopez of Jerdon, the floodplain was widened and deepened
during drainage improvements in the 1970s.

II. Definition of Study Area

DEFINITION OF AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT
Because the project impacts and completed construction will be at or below the grade of
surrounding neighborhoods, and because the completed project will not cause any substantial
increases in noise or other visual alterations to the surrounding area, the project’s Area of Potential
Effect (APE) is limited to the project’s mapped footprint (see Figure 2). During construction of the
proposed project, impacts to the APE north of Culebra Road will consist primarily of COSA’s
excavation to modify the existing channel, but will also include sanitary sewer improvements by the
San Antonio Water System (SAWS). South of Culebra Road, the only modifications north of
Zarzamora Creek will be the addition of a tree planting strip. South of Zarzamora Creek, there will
be significant excavation of soils to widen the drainage channel, but the current footprint of the
jurisdictional waters of Zarzamora Creek will not be modified. Additional impacts will likely include
the creation of new access roads and temporary staging areas for the removal of spoil. The exact
locations of the latter have yet to be determined, but are anticipated to be placed somewhere within
a roughly 30‐acre, COSA‐owned, wooded plot south of Culebra Road and west of Laven Road
(Figure 4).
Currently, the portion of Zarzamora Creek north of Culebra Road lies within a thin strip of
undeveloped land, bordered on both sides by residential development (see Figure 4). To the south,
commercial properties lie between Culebra Road and Zarzamora Creek, which has been heavily
impacted by prior channelization. Much of this area was inundated at the time of the survey (Figure
5). For the most part, the project area south of Zarzamora Creek is wooded, though some portions
have been subjected to mechanical disturbances.

PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENTS SOUTH OF CULEBRA ROAD
In March 2009, Medina Consulting Company (Medina) conducted a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment of the proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project (Medina
2009). Their work included an analysis of surface conditions and known or recognized hazards
within or adjacent to the project limits. They determined that there were “Recognized
Environmental Conditions” associated with unpermitted landfills in the project vicinity, as well as
with illegal dumping within and to the south and southwest of the project area. Their
recommendations included conducting a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment “to assess the
presence of buried solid waste and concentration and extent of impacts within the proposed project
limits” (Medina Consulting Company 2009:ii).

Figure 5. Inundation of Zarzamora floodplain south of Culebra Road, facing east.
In addition to the study noted above, remediation work was conducted in the previous Culebra
construction phases (Phase I and Phase IIA) (Medina 2007; Westbrook 2006). Approximately
12,380 cubic yards of impacted soil were removed, transported, and disposed of at a Texas
Commission of Environmental Quality–licensed disposal facility (Medina 2007). Impacted soil
consisted of roofing shingles, construction debris, steel rebar, lumber, automotive parts, glass,
plastic, asphalt, and soil. Based on the environmental investigations and remediation work, it
appeared that the impacted soil extended beyond the project limits. It is highly likely that these
materials may be present in the area of the proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage
Improvement Project.

III. METHODOLOGY
RECORDS REVIEW
Prior to the beginning of the fieldwork, a records review was conducted to determine whether any
previously recorded archeological sites, properties listed on the NRHP, SALs, cemeteries, or
historical markers are present within, or close to, the proposed project. This review utilized the
files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Online (Atlas), the Texas Historic Sites Atlas, the 1931 Stoner
System aerial photographs and property maps of Bexar County, as well as 1965 aerials and U.S.
Geological Survey topographic maps.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
During the pedestrian survey, transects were walked on each side of the drainage, with shovel tests
placed judgmentally at intervals of roughly 100 m (328 ft). Shovel tests were approximately 30
centimeter (cm) (12 inches) in diameter and excavated in arbitrary levels not exceeding 10 cm (4
inches). Whenever possible, they were excavated to subsoil (the Bt horizon), although some were
terminated due to inundation. The excavated soil from each shovel test was sifted through 0.64‐cm
(0.25‐inch) mesh hardware cloth when possible. Clayey matrices were hand sorted and visually
inspected. Information relating to each shovel test was recorded in a shovel test log, including a
description of the sediments present, the general environmental setting of the shovel test, its
position as marked by a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, and any additional comments. All
shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Collection was to be limited to rare or unusual
artifacts or those that could not be fully assessed in the field; no artifacts were encountered.

GEOARCHEOLOGICAL TRENCHING
Backhoe trenches were excavated along the portion of the project area north of Culebra Road and
within zones of 30 m (100 ft) in width on either side of the drainage channel. Mechanical
excavations were placed at intervals of roughly 100 m (328 ft), on alternating sides of the creek, for
a total of six trenches in all. These were placed at the judgment of the geoarcheologist based on the
likelihood of intact soils as well as backhoe accessibility.

100009496/100085

IV. RESULTS
RECORDS REVIEW
According to the records review, there are no previously recorded sites, NRHP properties, SALS,
cemeteries or historical markers plotted within 3 km (1.9 miles) of the proposed project area. A
review of the 1931 Stoner System aerial photographs and property maps of Bexar County identified
two structures that appear to be situated within 150 m (500 ft) of the project area south of Culebra
Road; however, 1965 aerials and topographic maps show no remaining traces of these.
Only one previous investigation is listed within the proposed project area, a 1981 Texas
Department of Transportation survey of Culebra Road (Weir 1981a). No sites were recorded during
this survey. The nearest recorded archeological sites, located approximately 3.5 km (2.2 miles) to
the west along Leon Creek, are 41BX555 (Weir 1981b), 41BX1534, 41BX1535, and 41BX1536
(Smith et al. 2003). These were prehistoric sites that yielded lithic debitage and burned rock, for the
most part within shallow and/or disturbed contexts. Site 41BX1536, however, possesses a deeply
buried prehistoric component, which has been recommended for further testing to evaluate its
potential eligibility for listing in the NRHP and for designation as a SAL (Smith et al. 2003).

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Shovel testing was conducted on the north side of Zarzamora Creek south of Culebra Road and on
both sides of the creek north of the road (see Figure 4 and Table 1). Shovel tests were placed at
intervals of roughly 100 m at the discretion of the field archeologists. Archeologists placed 3 shovel
tests south of Culebra Road in the tree‐planting strip, and 10 shovel tests north of Culebra Road. All
shovel tests proved negative for cultural materials or features.

GEOARCHEOLOGICAL TRENCHING
Geoarcheological investigations utilizing mechanical excavation equipment were performed along
Zarzamora Creek; five were placed north of Culebra Road, and one was placed south of the road on
the north side of the creek (see Figure 4). The purpose of the investigations was to assess the
project area for the potential of harboring deeply buried archeological sites. The following profile
descriptions are provided.

V. Results
Other than recent debris (e.g., candy wrappers), no buried cultural materials were observed in any
of the excavated backhoe trenches. Each of the trenches exhibited evidence of past subsurface
disturbances, which probably occurred in the 1970s during previous drainage improvements to
Zarzamora Creek. These past subsurface disturbances have removed all of the original A soil
horizon, leaving only remnants of the underlying B soil horizons. These were underlain by dense
gravel deposits, which evidence the high‐velocity nature of past flood episodes. Such turbulent
conditions would not have been conducive to archeological site preservation. No further
geoarcheological investigations are recommended.

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
Due to the presence of known contaminants adjacent to the project area and the possibility of
hazardous materials within the project area south of Zarzamora Creek, COSA hired Medina to
perform a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment of the area prior to the construction of the
proposed Culebra 58F – Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project.
On January 20 and 21, 2010, Medina excavated a series of 11 backhoe trenches “to determine if soil
contamination exists from the unpermitted landfill historically located to the southwest and within
the proposed project” (Medina 2010:4). Because of the unknown level of contaminants and
potential exposure to dangerous substances, the THC concurred that the trenching for Medina’s
environmental site assessment be allowed to proceed without the presence of an archeologist.
The site assessment’s program of backhoe trenching found discarded materials or construction and
demolition debris in 9 out of 11 trenches, to depths ranging between 1.2 m (4 ft) and 3.7 m (12 ft),
and averaging 2.1 m (7 ft). Based on these results, Medina estimates that 82 percent of the soils to
be removed by the project south of Zarzamora Creek may include such artificial fill (Medina
2010:2). While levels above the Texas Specific Background Concentrations were found for arsenic
in one trench and lead in the majority of the trenches where debris was found, all concentrations
were below the detection limits of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure analyses.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
Neither the pedestrian survey nor the geoarcheological investigations of the proposed Culebra 58F
– Phase IIB Drainage Improvement Project in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, revealed evidence
of cultural resources. No artifacts or features were observed either on the surface or within the
subsurface testing. Thirteen shovel tests and six backhoe trenches were placed across the
accessible portions of the APE, an area of roughly 10.4 acres (4.2 ha). The APE south of Zarzamora
Creek was not investigated by archeologists due to the presence of historical dumping and filling
and possible contamination. Environmental testing revealed that the majority of trenches contained
fill of construction and demolition debris to depths often exceeding those of the proposed project
impacts (Medina 2010).
Due to the results of the intensive pedestrian survey, geoarcheological trenching, and
environmental site assessment, no additional archeological investigations are recommended. It is
the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that the proposed 58F – Phase IIB Drainage
Improvement Project be allowed to proceed. The THC has concurred with these recommendations
(see Appendix).

Project No. 100008770
RE: Intensive Archeological Survey of the Proposed Harris Branch Interceptor Lower B, Travis Counly,
Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5625.

Dear Mr. Baker,
Enclosed for your review is a copy of the above named report, which presents the results of an intensive
survey PBS&J performed for Austin Water Utility (AWU). Because the project is sponsored by AWU, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, the survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
5625; the project did not require the involvement of federal agencies.
The proposed project area will parallel the southwestern bank of Gilleland Creek for a distance of
approximately 2,286 meters (m) (7,500 feet [ft]) between State Flighway 130 and U.S. Highway 290.
Construction will require both permanent and temporary easements totaling roughly 45.7 m (150 ft) in
width, for a project area of roughly 29 acres (11.7 hectares).
PBS&J archeologists conducted the survey from May 5 to May 7, 2010, revisiting two previously recorded
sites 41TV2341 and 41TV2344, both consisting of light prehistoric scatters and historic dumps and
identifying one new site, 41TV2374, a 1936 brick-and-cement cistern. None appear to meet the eligibility
requirements for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks. It is recommended that no further
archeological investigation is necessary and that construction of the proposed Harris Branch Interceptor
Lower B Project be allowed to proceed.
