ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC’s
Skull and Bones Prospect was conducted on February 26, 2008 by BVRA in
eastern Galveston County, Texas with negative results. The investigation
examined a proposed drill site and a portion of a proposed 10-inch pipeline, an
area consisting of 4.04 acres. Virtually all of the project area is located in a low
marshy setting with little high ground. Two shovel tests were excavated in wet
sand, and no cultural materials were observed or collected. It is concluded that
the project area was not a suitable setting for a prehistoric campsite. It is,
therefore, recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC of Corpus Christi, Texas plans to
conduct drilling and production activities in order to develop oil and gas reserves
underlying private property in the extreme eastern end of Galveston County,
Texas (Figure 1). This area is known as the Skull and Crossbones Prospect, and
it includes the proposed construction of a boarded drill site, boarded access road,
and approximately 17,990 feet of 10-inch pipeline. This pipeline will connect the
proposed drill site on the coast with the proposed Central Gas Sales Facility to
the north, which is associated with the Lafitte’s Gold Prospect (Moore 2008).
The pipeline will follow existing and proposed roads to connect the Central Gas
Facility with the drill site. From State Highway 87, a boarded road will be
constructed for a distance of 865 feet with a width of 20 feet to the proposed drill
site. If the well is successful, additional aggregate will be added to its surface,
and the underlying culverts will be updated to allow the mobilization of heavy
equipment to the drill site. While drilling operations are active, the drill site will
occupy a footprint of approximately 3.67 acres and will be 400 feet by 400 feet in
size. Suemaur will use a lined berm and borrow ditch around the drill site for
containment. If the well is successful, the temporary board pad will be replaced
with one constructed of compacted clay, sand, and gravel. These materials will
be stabilized as required with a cement additive. The permanent pad may be
raised as much as 12 inches to 18 inches from the ground surface. The project
area is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle High Island (2994422) (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information is taken from the soil survey for Galveston
County (Crenwelge et al. 1988:1). Galveston County is located in the southeast
part of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico and has a total area of 424,961 acres.
Generally, the land surface is characterized as broad and nearly level with
elevations ranging from sea level to about 45 feet in the northwest part of the
county. The modern climate of Galveston County consists of hot and humid
summers and mild winters. In winter, the average temperature is 47 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the average daily temperature is 33 degrees. In summer, the
average temperature is 83 degrees, and the average daily temperature is 87
degrees. Total annual precipitation is 39.73 inches. Of this amount, 23 inches
(60%) usually falls in April through September. The area investigated is depicted
on Sheet 6 of the Galveston County soil survey. The entire area surveyed is
located within the soil type described by Crenwelge et al. (1988:48-49) as Veston
loam, slightly saline-strongly saline complex (Vx). This complex consists of nearly
level, poorly drained saline loamy soils that have loamy subsoil. They are found
on coastal marsh flats. In a typical profile, the surface layer is dark gray loam
about 10 inches thick. At 60 inches, the loamy soil changes to a clay loam and
clay at 65 inches. This soil is slowly permeable, and surface runoff is very slow.
Vx soils flood frequently by storm tides, and the water table is within two feet of
the surface most of the year. Figure 3 depicts the marshy conditions in the
project area at the proposed drill site, and Figure 4 depicts the existing access
road that was built up in order to traverse the marshy area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The areas most likely to contain significant prehistoric sites are the
shorelines along the mainland and the inland bays and streams where Indians
gathered to consume Rangia cuneata, oysters, and brackish water clams. As
they discarded the used shells, large middens accumulated. This was a
seasonal practice, as they camped on the shell heaps until they moved to other
areas. Evidence for campsites consists of pottery, animal bone, flakes, and flint
tools such as arrow points. Shell middens have been recorded along the coast
and in inland settings, and these sites are a common occurrence in the area.
Since the prehistoric Indians probably traversed the entire area within the project
area boundaries, any elevated landform above water is likely to contain evidence
of their presence. A recent survey by archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates
(Gadus and Moss 2001), for example, documented shell middens along the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway from High Island to the Brazos River Diversion Channel in
Brazoria, Chambers, and Galveston counties. The potential for offshore sites
has to be viewed as high based on the presence of the McFaddin Beach site
(41JF50) in adjacent Jefferson County.
Historic accounts of Indian activity in the area suggest that the area was
intensively utilized during different seasons of the year. Explorers such as
Cabeza de Vaca observed the local Indians moving about the area where they
subsisted on various foods and animals that were available at that time. He
noted that in the winter they inhabited an island (possibly Galveston Island)
where they ate roots and fish and slept on mats on shells with a few skins for
cover. In the spring they returned to the mainland or seashore where they
collected berries and oysters. In the summer they moved back to the island
where they ate wild potatoes along with a few buffalo and deer (Gilmore 1974:
Table 1.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the site records by Jean Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records
at TARL in Austin, Texas, revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. In the 1950s, Thomas Nolan Campbell (1957) reported on the
Caplen site (41GV1), and his work represents the first professional study of a
prehistoric site in the county. Prehistoric cemeteries have been documented in
the area and include the Caplen site (41GV1) located just south of the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway on Bolivar Peninsula, the Jamaica Beach site (41GV5)
and the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) located on Galveston Island facing West
Bay. Aten (1965) conducted excavations at the Jamaica Beach site and found
human remains believed to be associated with the coastal Karankawa. Work by
Ricklis (1994) at Mitchell Ridge identified habitation features such as hearths,
pits, a house floor, activity areas, and four burial areas with about 52 individuals
present. A check of the Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that one linear survey
has been conducted in the project area and vicinity. The Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) performed this study in 2005 with negative results. The
project area paralleled old State Highway 87 on its north side and part of a twotrack road. This report is not on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, and a copy could not be obtained from TxDOT.
In addition to the detailed monograph by Ricklis (1994) and an in-depth
report by Gadus and Moss (2001), the interested reader is referred to two major
works that discuss in detail the archaeology of Southeast Texas. These are
Aten’s (1983) exhaustive work entitled Indians of the Upper Texas Coast and
The Archeology and Bioarcheology of the Gulf Plain (Story et al. 1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator discussed the project
with the lead reviewer for this project, William A. Martin, Staff Archaeologist of
the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. It was decided at this
meeting that the proposed drill site and 2500 feet of pipeline are the only areas
that needed to be investigated. Next, relevant reports involving previous
archaeological research in the area and elsewhere in the county were reviewed
in order to become familiar with the kinds of sites known to occur in the area.
Phil Bishop and Ally Freer walked over as much of the project as possible given
the wet conditions of the marshy setting. The project footprint was not flagged.
Therefore, the field survey crew located the corners of the drill site and the
pipeline route using a Trimble Geo-Explorer GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy.
The area was examined by a pedestrian survey, two shovel tests, and shovel
probes. The two shovel tests were excavated along the proposed access road
from State Highway 87 to the proposed drill site and were dug through wet sand
to 60 cm. Both were negative. The field survey crew also looked for the
presence of historic sites that might be visible in the form of features. The project
was documented through field notes and digital photographs.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A review of site records at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin,
Texas revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area,
and the area has not been examined by professional archaeologists. The
proposed drill site is not viewed as a likely setting for a prehistoric site because of
the marshy conditions and distance to the nearest stream (East Bay Bayou). This
study revealed that portions of the project area had been disturbed through oil
and gas activities. This study was performed according to the minimum survey
standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC. be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site
be found during construction, all work in the area of the find must cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In the event that
additional areas are added to the project, the Texas Historical Commission must
be notified as additional survey(s) by a professional archaeologist may be
necessary.
