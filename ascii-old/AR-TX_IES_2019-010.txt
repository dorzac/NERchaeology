ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the proposed MGR Bikeway (Duck Creek Trail Connections) project in the City of
Garland, Dallas County, Texas. The proposed project pertains to the construction of new
trail segments to connect existing trails along Duck Creek. As the project will require
compliance with a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act Nationwide Permit from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), portions of the project will be subjected to the
provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
Additionally, as the City of Garland is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the
project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of this survey was to locate cultural resources that could be adversely affected by
the proposed project, and to provide an evaluation of the eligibility potential of each
identified resource for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). This cultural resources survey was
conducted by Principal Investigator Christopher Goodmaster, Project Archeologist
Thomas Chapman, and Field Technician Josh McCormick on 28 and 31 January 2019. All
work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations for
implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8721.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All project-related records and field data
will be temporarily stored at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the
Center for Archeological Research (CAR) at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No
further cultural resources investigation or evaluation of the APE is recommended.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators
should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and
immediately contact the project cultural resources consultant to initiate coordination with
the USACE and Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to resuming construction
activities.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to BW2 Engineers, Inc., on behalf of the City of Garland. The purpose
of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE) and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and
associated state regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]).
The goal of this survey was to locate, identify, and assess archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other
cultural resources within the APE that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs.
This investigation was conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the
regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. Prepared in accordance
with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the NHPA Section
106 and the ACT requirements of the proposed project. A description of the proposed project area, pertinent
regulations, environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the
investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources are provided in this
document.

1.1 Regulatory Framework
Antiquities Code of Texas
As the City of Garland is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the
ACT. The ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that Texas Historical Commission (THC) staff review
actions that have the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites on public land. Actions that require
review under the ACT include any project that includes ground-disturbing activities on land owned or
controlled by a political subdivision of the State and include easements on private property. This survey
was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8721.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
The proposed project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Permit from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE). Therefore, portions of the project will be subject to the provisions of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended. The NHPA (54 U.S. Code [U.S.C.] 300101 et seq.), specifically Section 106
of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) requires the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), an official
appointed in each State or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation activities, and to
review and comment on all actions licensed by the federal government that will have an effect on properties
listed in the NRHP, or eligible for such listing. Per 36 CFR 800, the federal agency responsible for
overseeing the action must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The APE encompasses approximately 2.45 acres (ac) and consists of two segments, which are herein
referred to as the Northern APE and Southern APE (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The Northern APE is located
approximately 0.05 mile (mi) southwest of the intersection of Centerville Road and Duck Creek Drive/1st
Street. The Southern APE is located approximately 2.57 mi southeast of the Northern APE and is 0.40 mi

southwest of the intersection of Interstate Highway (IH) 30 and North Belt Line Road/Broadway Boulevard.
The proposed project entails the construction of two pedestrian trail sections, which will connect existing
trails along Duck Creek. The project will consist of tree removal, grading, and the installation of pavement,
drainage outfalls, retaining walls along the trail near Centerville Road bridge, and a retaining wall north of
Duck Creek in the Southern APE. The proposed trails will cross Duck Creek in both the Northern and
Southern APE. The northern crossing will include the installation of reinforced concrete rip-rap and a 210foot (ft) steel truss pedestrian bridge anchored by piers. The southern creek crossing will include rock riprap reinforcement walls and a 100-ft steel truss pedestrian bridge anchored by piers. The maximum depth
of impacts from the installation of bridge piers will extend to approximately 24 ft below the ground surface.
Indirect APE
As the project will require federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of the indirect effects will
be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements. It is anticipated
that the sole potential indirect effect of the undertaking would be related to visual effects associated with
the construction of the two pedestrian bridges to historic-age (i.e., greater than 50 years old) structures in
the vicinity. To account for these proposed above-ground elements, a 100-ft-wide indirect APE was
assessed surrounding the USACE jurisdictional impact areas associated with bridge construction.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas County lies in the north-central part of the State of Texas. Annual precipitation averages between
approximately 35 to 42 inches (in). About half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and
May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a
relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and
Earl 2008).
Topography, Geology, and Soils
The Mesquite and White Rock Lake 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle maps illustrate that the APE
is located on the floodplain and terraces of Duck Creek and on the sloping margins of an upland ridge
within a suburban park setting (see Figure 1.2). The primary topographic feature of the APE is Duck
Creek, which flows in a generally northwest-to-southeast direction towards the East Fork Trinity River.
Previous urban development adjacent to the APE has since altered much of the topographic setting
surrounding the APE. Clearing and grading has resulted in leveling the terrain and channelizing a portion
of Duck Creek in the vicinity of the Northern APE.
The APE lies within the Northern Blackland Prairie subregion of the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion.
This area is distinguished from surrounding regions by gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black, clay-rich
soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and
consist of high clay content soils that have significant shrink and swell potential. Most of the native prairie
has been converted to cropland, non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses. Historical vegetation
included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed.
The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Ozan (Ko) and Quaternary-age alluvium (Qal) geologic
formations (McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2019; Figure 2.1). The Ozan Formation is comprised of sandy,
chalky, and glauconitic marl (Scoggins 2004). The Quaternary-age alluvium and terrace deposits are
comprised of clay and silty clay largely derived from the Trinity River and its major tributaries (USGS
2019).
As illustrated by the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas, there are nine soil map units within the APE
(Coffee et al. 1980; Figure 2.2; Tables 2.1 and 2.2). Approximately 14.5 percent of the Northern APE and
55.6 percent of the Southern APE contains soils typical of upland settings in the Northern Blackland Prairies
region. The remaining 85.5 percent and 44.4 percent of the Northern and Southern APE, respectively,
contain frequently flooded alluvial soils along Duck Creek. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil
Survey 2019).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA)
maintained by the THC indicated there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register
properties or districts, historical markers, or cemeteries within the APE (TASA 2019; THSA 2019). The
TASA database identified two previously conducted archeological surveys within portions of the APE
(TASA 2019; Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). However, both surveys were reconnaissance in nature and did not
include subsurface investigations (SDHPT 1987; Whitsett 1978). In addition, TASA records indicate that
four previously conducted archeological surveys and a single previously recorded archeological site are
located within 1 mi of the APE (TASA 2019; Tables 3.2 and 3.3).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional resources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These resources included soil survey data
(NRCS 2019; Coffee et al 1980), geologic data (McGowen et al. 1987), the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the National Archives and
Records Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Dallas County, the Texas
Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and historic and modern aerial photography and satellite
imagery.

Disturbance Analysis
During the background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use
have transpired within the APE. Historical aerial photographs indicate that the property parcels within and
adjacent to the APE were primarily used for agricultural or ranching purposes as early as 1942, and
presumably since the late 19th or early 20th centuries. The majority of the APE has been cleared of woody
vegetation at various points throughout the 20th century, which has gradually become covered by secondary
growth.
Beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, urbanization began to spread to eastern Dallas County. The
area surrounding the Northern APE was largely developed into residential subdivisions. Prior to 1968,
several commercial buildings were constructed adjacent to the Northern APE at the southwest corner of
Duck Creek Drive and Centerville Road, which had been paved and widened. In the 1970s, most of the
APE north of Centerville Road was heavily disturbed by construction activities associated with the
expansion of the road. During this road project, it appears that Duck Creek was partially channelized.
Between 1989 and 2001, park trails, access roads, stormwater outflow channels, and parking lots were
constructed in parts of the APE. Currently, the Northern APE is situated in the Lon L. Wynne Park, north
of Centerville Road and Bass Park, south of Centerville Road.
Based on a review of historical aerial photographs, the Southern APE was used for agricultural purposes or
remained undeveloped for most of the 20th century. Notable disturbances within and adjacent to the
Southern APE include the construction of IH 30 between 1942 and 1952, completion of highway frontage
roads in the late 1970s, operation of the Belt Line-67 drive-in movie theater east of the APE, installation of
a wastewater sewer line, and construction of commercial buildings north of IH 30 in 2010 or 2011. Between
1979 and 1989, multiple overhead electric transmission lines were erected in the APE and the corridor has
been routinely maintained. Prior to 2001, a stormwater outfall channel was installed near the northern part
of the Southern APE. This channel was filled when the adjacent property was developed in 2011.
Construction of Greenbelt Parkway and the Duck Creek Trail took place along the northern margin of the
Southern APE in 2006. In 2008, the overhead electric transmission line corridor, extending through the
Southern APE, received extensive maintenance that included vegetation clearing, grading, and installation
of rock rip-rap armoring at channel crossings.
Direct APE
Prehistoric Archeological Resources Potential
Although only a single prehistoric archeological site (41DL50) has been previously recorded within 1 mi
of the APE, several prehistoric archeological sites have been documented along the Duck Creek watershed.
Previously recorded sites within the watershed occupy both the upland terrace escarpments (41DL47,
41DL48, 41DL50, and 41DL195) as well as the floodplain of Duck Creek (41DL457). According to the
TxDOT PALM, most of the overall APE contains a moderate to high potential for shallow and deeply
buried cultural materials within previously undisturbed areas. The remainder of the APE north of
Centerville Road and along IH 30 features a low to moderate potential for containing shallow and deeply
buried cultural deposits within a reasonable context. As previously discussed, significant ground-disturbing
activities have transpired within the APE that have likely compromised the contextual integrity of the area.
Subsequently, the potential for the preservation of archeological deposits within previously disturbed
portions of the APE has been reduced to moderate to low.
Historic Period Resources Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically, these
types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, streams, and open
pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures is problematic,
maps depicting these features in the vicinity of the APE are available as early as 1920.

Page 11

Based on a review of historical maps and aerial photographs, the APE once contained two buildings. The
1920 USDA Dallas County soils map depicts a building located within the northern terminus of the
Southern APE. However, this building is not illustrated on the 1900 Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County
or the 1936 Dallas County Highway map, nor is it visible on 1942 aerial photographs. The former location
of the structure has subsequently been disturbed by the installation of utilities and a drainage channel. The
other building within the APE was identified in an aerial photograph dating to 1942. The photograph
indicates the building was located in the northern portion of the Northern APE. The building is not depicted
on historical maps and appears to have been demolished by 1952. Construction activities related to the
expansion of Centerville Road and creation of the Lon L. Wynne Park have caused significant disturbance
around the former location of the building. In consideration of significant past ground disturbing activities,
the potential of encountering historic-age archeological resources with contextual integrity is low.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
A review of historical and modern aerial photographs indicate there are no historic-aged architectural
resources within the indirect APE associated with the proposed project.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
The methods utilized during this survey satisfy the archeological survey standards for field investigations
recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved by the THC. Components of the survey included
archival and background research, pedestrian reconnaissance survey, and intensive archeological survey.
Prior to fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the
locations of previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-kilometer [km]) radius
of the direct APE (see Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, historical
and modern topographic maps, and aerial photographs of the APE. Due to the variability in prehistoric and
historic-period settlement patterns, land use, and archeological site preservation potential within the APE,
multiple survey and sampling methods were used during this investigation, including the use of systematic
shovel testing and backhoe trenching to identify archeological site locations.
Pedestrian Survey
The intensive pedestrian survey consisted of visual examination of the ground surface and existing
subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within previously unsurveyed and undisturbed
portions of the APE. The pedestrian survey consisted of a single transect, which was implemented along
portions of the APE corridor with the potential to contain archeological deposits. The pedestrian survey
transect generally followed the centerline of the proposed trail. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance
were photographed to document the lack of potential for containing archeological deposits. Other
documentation methods included narrative notes and maps.
Intensive Survey
In areas with potential for the preservation of buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated
to the top of culturally sterile deposits, typically the argillic (Bt) subsoil horizon in this area. Each shovel
test was at least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm in
thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.64-cm hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of buried
cultural materials. If clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened, the excavated soil was
troweled through by hand and inspected for cultural materials. Investigators documented the results of each
shovel test on standardized forms. In addition, all shovel test locations were recorded using hand-held
Global Positioning System (GPS) units.
Standards for archeological methods typically require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For
this reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in,
ft, mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., cm,
meter [m], km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.
Backhoe Trenching
Due to the depth of the proposed impacts within the Duck Creek floodplain, archeological investigations
included backhoe trenching. Backhoe trenching was conducted where proposed impacts will exceed 1 m
in depth within previously undisturbed portions the Duck Creek floodplain at the locations proposed for the
installation of bridge piers.
Backhoe trenches averaged 6 m in length and were excavated to a maximum depth of 3.5 m. After each
trench had been excavated to a depth of approximately 2 m, an Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) competent field supervisor assessed the stability of the trench prior to recording
soil data. After detailed recording of the uppermost 2 m of the exposed soil profile, excavation continued
to the maximum depth of 3.5 m. Soil profile data for excavation depths greater than 2 m were estimated
from excavated samples and measurements taken from the top of each trench profile. Backhoe trench
profiles and excavated fill were monitored for the presence of archeological materials. A representative
soil sample from each stratigraphic layer was screened through 0.64-cm hardware mesh or was manually

troweled and inspected for cultural materials. The remaining excavated soil was visually inspected as it
was placed on the spoil pile. Trench excavation ceased once excavation reached the vertical extent of
Holocene soils, bedrock, water table, or the maximum depth at which the backhoe could safely excavate.
Each excavated trench was photographed, recorded using a GPS unit, and backfilled.
Archival Research
Prior to field investigations, a suite of archival sources including historic maps and aerial photographs was
reviewed to determine former land use patterns and the locations of historic-age (i.e., greater than 50 years
old) structures within the direct APE and indirect APE.

4.2 Curation
No artifacts were encountered during this investigation. Project-related records, field notes, photographs,
forms, and other documentation will be curated. These project records will be prepared to CAR curation
standards. All project records will be temporarily stored at the IES office and will be permanently curated
at CAR at The University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted across the entire APE to confirm the extent of
prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground surface
visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Intensive survey
with systematic shovel test sampling was conducted across previously unsurveyed and undisturbed portions
of the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources within the shallow subsurface. Backhoe
trenching was conducted where proposed impacts will exceed 1 m in depth within previously undisturbed
portions of the Duck Creek floodplain due to the potential for deeply buried archeological deposits in the
floodplain setting.

5.1 Archeological Survey
Pedestrian and Intensive Survey Observations
Pedestrian survey verified the past ground disturbances outlined in Chapter 3. The Northern APE, in Lon
L. Wynne Park on the west side of Duck Creek, featured concrete parking areas and sidewalks (Appendix
A, Photographs 1 and 2). Duck Creek has been channelized and modified with stormwater outfalls
(Appendix A, Photographs 3 and 4). The portion of the APE in Lon L. Wynne Park on the east side of
Duck Creek has sidewalks bisecting the APE and the margins of the Duck Creek channel have been graded
(Appendix A, Photographs 5 through 9). The APE then passes under the Centerville Road bridge, which
is disturbed from the construction of the bridge (Appendix A, Photographs 10 and 11). The APE then
follows the eastern bank of the channelized creek for 0.17 mi in a northwest-to-southeast direction, until
reaching a concrete sidewalk and stormwater outfall processing structure (Appendix A, Photographs 12
through 16).
The Southern APE, extending southwest from the existing Duck Creek Trail, traverses an elevated
construction pad site before turning south and southeast to parallel a disturbed utility easement containing
a buried sanitary sewer pipeline and an overhead electric utility line (Appendix A, Photographs 17 through
19). After crossing under the IH 30 bridge, the APE continues to follow the utility easement and terminates
immediately south of Duck Creek (Appendix A, Photographs 20 and 21).
Shovel tests were conducted within previously unsurveyed portions of the APE with the potential to contain
intact buried cultural deposits within the shallow subsurface. During the intensive survey, 10 negative
shovel tests were excavated in the Northern APE and two negative shovel tests were excavated within the
Southern APE (Figure 5.1). The remaining portions of the APE were determined to have been subjected
to significant previous ground disturbances. Previously disturbed areas were visually assessed and
photographed during the pedestrian survey.
Soils exposed within shovel tests generally revealed a profile that transitioned from very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) to brown (10YR 4/3) clay that contained few to no gravel inclusions (Appendix A, Photograph
22). Portions of the APE featured soils that exhibited heavy mottling within yellowish brown (10YR 5/6)
and light gray (10YR 7/2) clays and limestone gravels. The majority of the Southern APE was extensively
disturbed through previous construction and maintenance of the utility easement corridor. Additionally, an
exposed cut bank within the Duck Creek channel west of the APE exhibited the presence of a paleosol
(buried A horizon) approximately 2 m below the ground surface (Appendix A, Photograph 23).

Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe trenching was conducted within previously undisturbed portions of the Duck Creek floodplain due
to the potential for preservation of deeply buried archeological deposits within the alluvial setting. Two
backhoe trenches were excavated within the APE at the locations proposed for the pedestrian bridge piers
(see Figure 5.1; Table 5.1). Despite the observation of a well-developed paleosol at a depth of
approximately 2 m along the distal bank of a meander upstream and west of the APE, this paleosol was not
observed in either trench excavated within the APE.
Trench 1 was excavated approximately 3 m south of the Duck Creek channel (Appendix A, Photographs
24 through 28). The soil profile exposed within Trench 1 consisted of a thin surface layer of yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam overlying a nearly 1-m thick deposit of dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam
mixed with a large quantity of modern construction debris. At a depth of 116 cm below surface (cmbs),
dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam with a weak platy structure transitioning to weak subangular blocky
structure was encountered within the upper 20 cm of the stratum, which gradually transitioned to massive
structure with depth. This stratum may represent a weakly-developed paleosol (buried A horizon),
indicating a period of relative landscape stability allowing formation of the A horizon followed by a period
of widespread upland erosion and alluvial deposition that served to bury and preserve the former ground
surface. This stratum gradually transitioned to grayish brown (10YR 5/2) massive clay loam with brownish
yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles at a depth of approximately 145 cmbs. The final stratum likely represents preHolocene alluvial deposits and is unlikely to contain or overly prehistoric cultural deposits.
Trench 2 was excavated north of the Duck Creek channel. The soil profile exposed within Trench 2 was
generally similar to Trench 1 (Appendix A, Photographs 29 and 30). Like Trench 1, a significant quantity
of construction debris was encountered within upper portion of Trench 2, extending to a depth of
approximately 51 cmbs. A similar, weakly-developed paleosol, consisting of an approximately 30 cm thick
very dark gray (10YR 3/1) massive clay, gradually transitioned to a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) massive
sandy clay loam by a depth of 80 cmbs. This stratum continued to a depth of at least 350 cmbs, where
excavation ceased due to depth limitations of the excavation equipment.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During this cultural resources survey for the proposed MGR Bikeway (Duck Creek Trail Connections)
project, the entire 2.45-ac APE was inspected through pedestrian reconnaissance and intensive survey. In
total, 12 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated within the APE. All shovel tests and
backhoe trenches were negative for artifacts or cultural deposits. In addition, 100-ft-wide indirect APE
buffers surrounding USACE jurisdictional impact areas associated with bridge construction were reviewed
for indirect visual impacts to historic-age architectural resources as per Section 106 of the NHPA. As a
result of the survey, no archeological sites or above-ground architectural resources were encountered within
the APE and no architectural resources were identified within the indirect APE.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the MGR Bikeway (Duck Creek Trail Connections) project
be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any
cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators should immediately stop construction
activities in the area of the inadvertent discovery. The project cultural resources consultant should then be
contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities. In
addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within this report are to be impacted,
additional field investigations may be required.
