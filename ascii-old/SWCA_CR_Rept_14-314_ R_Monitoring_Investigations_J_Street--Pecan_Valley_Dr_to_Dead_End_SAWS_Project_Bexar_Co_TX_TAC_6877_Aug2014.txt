ABSTRACT
On behalf of S&GE, LLC, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted cultural resources
monitoring for the J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System (SAWS) Project
(J Street Project) located in east San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas under Antiquities Code of Texas 6877.
The proposed project consisted of the replacement and installation of a sewer and water line within J
Street. The investigations were done to satisfy requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas as well as
the Historic Preservation and Design Section of the City of San Antonio’s Unified Development Code.
The monitoring activities were recommended by the City of San Antonio Office of Historic Preservation
(SA-OHP), due to the close proximity of the project area to previously recorded site 41BX64 to the east
of the project area. SWCA investigations consisted of a background review and archaeological
monitoring.
The anticipated impacts are expected to be limited to the excavation and installation of the SAWS water
line and would be conducted within a 30-foot temporary workspace entirely within the J Street right-of­
way (ROW). Additional excavations for a replacement SAWS sewer line are also proposed for the J Street
Project but will be excavated entirely within existing utility trenches and will not require archaeological
monitoring. SWCA proposed to monitor only the new excavations related to the SAWS main water line.
The area of potential effects (APE) for the J Street Project area is approximately 900 feet long, 3 feet
wide, and maximally 6 feet deep within the existing J Street ROW. In addition, five service line tie-ins of
various lengths and totaling 100 feet were excavated within adjacent side streets. The APE is less than 1
acre in size. The majority of the project will be open trenched within the 30-foot-wide J Street ROW
which includes temporary construction impacts. Thus, the APE encompasses 0.06 acre and potentially
involves 600 cubic yards of disturbance.
The background review determined that no previously conducted surveys or previously recorded sites are
within the project area. One previously conducted survey and one previously recorded site, 41BX64, are
adjacent to the eastern boundary of the project area. In addition, seven previously conducted survey
investigations; three cemeteries; two archaeological sites; and one historic marker are located within a 1 ­
mile radius of the project area. A historic map review determined that no historic resources are located
within the project area.
SWCA conducted monitoring investigations for the SAWS main water line replacement trench and
associated service line tie-ins of the J Street Project on June 12, 16, 19, 20, and 23, 2014. Trenching
excavations for the SAWS water line began at the intersection of Pecan Valley and J Street and extended
to the east towards the J Street Park parking lot. Five service line tie-in trenches of various lengths were
then excavated near the intersections of J Street and Pecan Valley Drive, J Street and Adamston Drive, J
Street and Amberson Drive, and within the J Street Park parking lot. Portions of the excavation identified
by SAWS as being within existing utility lines and disturbance were not monitored by SWCA. The
excavations revealed disturbances related to existing utilities within most of the project area. Portions of
the excavations within undisturbed soils consisted of gravelly clay loam with 30 to 50 percent chert and
limestone gravel inclusions. No significant cultural deposits were encountered during the monitored
excavations of the project area.
The proposed undertaking will have no effects on any significant cultural resources within the APE down
to 6 feet and SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations. In the event that previously
undiscovered archaeological remains are discovered during construction, SWCA recommends further
coordination with the SA-OHP. No artifacts were collected; thus, nothing was curated.

Cultural Resource Monitoring Investigations for the
J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

Drive, and within the J Street Park parking lot.
Based on a general review of recent aerial
photography, the project area rests within a highly
urbanized residential neighborhood furnished with
residential streets and a city park at the eastern end
of the project area.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of S&GE, LLC, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted cultural resources
monitoring for the J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to
Dead End San Antonio Water System (SAWS)
Project (J Street Project) located in east San
Antonio, Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). The
proposed project consisted of the replacement and
installation of a sewer and water line within J
Street right-of-way (ROW). The investigations
were done to satisfy requirements of the
Antiquities Code of Texas under permit number
6877, as well as the Historic Preservation and
Design Section of the City of San Antonio’s
Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360 to
35-634).

The east end of the project area terminates
approximately 130 feet west of an unnamed
tributary of Salado Creek, with the main channel
of Salado Creek being located approximately 520
feet southeast of the project area. The vegetation
surrounding the project area consists mainly of
landscaped residential lawns. The eastern end of
the project area is adjacent to the J Street Park that
contains a moderately dense forest that borders the
unnamed tributary. The topography of the project
area is characterized as gently sloping terrain that
flows towards the confluence of the unnamed
drainage and Salado Creek to the east-southeast.

The purpose of the work was to locate and identify
all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites
within the project area, establish vertical and
horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with
regard to the project area, and evaluate the
significance of any site recorded within the
property.
Monitoring
investigations
were
recommended by the City of San Antonio Office
of Historic Preservation (SA-OHP), due to the
close proximity of the project area to previously
recorded site 41BX64. SWCA archaeologists
Laura I. Acuña and Rhiana D. Ward conducted the
field work on June 12, 16, 19, 20, and 23, 2014.

The anticipated impacts for the J Street Project
area are expected to be limited to the excavation
and installation of the SAWS water line and its
associated tie-ins. The work would be conducted
within a 30-foot temporary workspace entirely
within the J Street ROW. Additional excavations
for a replacement SAWS sewer line are also
proposed for the J Street Project but will be
excavated entirely within existing utility trenches
and will not require archaeological monitoring.
SWCA proposed to monitor only the new
excavations related to the SAWS water line and
associated service line tie-in trenches. The area of
potential effects (APE) for the J Street Project area
is approximately 900 feet long, 3 feet wide, and
maximally 6 feet deep within the existing J Street
ROW. The five service line tie-in trenches vary in
length, totaling approximately 100 feet, and are 3
feet wide and 5 to 6 feet deep. The majority of the
project will be open trenched within the 30-foot­
wide J Street ROW which includes temporary
construction impacts. Thus, the APE encompasses
0.06 acre and potentially involves 600 cubic yards
of disturbance.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The J Street Project area consists of a linear
segment that parallels the J Street ROW for
approximately 800 feet (Figure 2) and five service
line tie-in trenches of various lengths that spur
from the main trench. The project area begins at
the intersection of Pecan Valley and J Street and
extends east for its entire length before terminating
within the parking lot of the J Street Park. The
service line tie-in trenches are located near the
intersections of J Street and Pecan Valley Drive, J
Street and Adamston Drive, J Street and Amberson

SOILS

FIELD METHODS

The J Street Project area soils are comprised of 60
percent Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3 percent
slopes and 40 percent Branyon clay with 1 to 3
percent slopes (NRCS 2014). The Lewisville
series consists of very deep, well drained silty clay
that formed in ancient loamy and calcareous
sediments. Branyon clays are very deep,
moderately well-drained, and very slowly
permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey
sediments with 0 to 3 percent slope (NRCS 2014).

The goal of monitoring for the J Street Project area
was to gather information on the nature and types
of cultural resources possibly buried in the project
area, particularly within a focus area of known
previously recorded resources. Due to its close
proximity to Salado Creek and archaeological site
41BX64, the project has a moderate potential for
buried cultural deposits. Therefore, monitoring
efforts were focused on the eastern end of the J
Street Project area.

GEOLOGY

SWCA archaeologists coordinated all field
activities with appropriate personnel and any onsite construction foreman regarding scheduling
and safety. The archaeologists complied with all
applicable Occupational Safety and Health
Administration safety regulations and wore all
required safety equipment (e.g., hardhat and steeltoed boots). Monitoring consisted of a qualified
archaeologist observing the excavation process,
the excavation area, and their resulting fill,
frequently inspecting it for cultural remains. If
encountered, artifacts were to be examined,
quantified and assessed as to age and origin, and
generally were not collected. Diagnostic artifacts
or those of particular interest were to be collected
for further study in SWCA labs.

Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100
percent Terrace deposits (Barnes 1983). These
deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravels in
various proportions (Barnes 1983).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a background search of cultural
resources and environmental literature pertaining
to the project area. An SWCA archaeologist
reviewed the San Antonio East (2998-113) U.S.
Geological
Survey
(USGS)
7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps of the Texas
Historical
Commission
(THC)
Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database
and the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) Historic Overlay maps for any
previously recorded surveys and historic or
prehistoric archaeological sites located in or near
the project area. In addition to identifying recorded
archaeological sites, the review included
information on the following types of cultural
resources: National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) properties, State Archeological Landmark
(SALs), Official Texas Historical Markers,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys. Aerial
photographs were reviewed to assist in identifying
any disturbances.

If intact cultural resources were revealed in the
construction process, the archaeologist would
attempt to make a determination as to potential
significance. At this point, construction was to be
temporarily halted so that the archaeologist could
better examine the cultural materials or features,
take photographs, and thoroughly document the
finds. Once the materials were assessed,
construction would recommence, and continue as
planned. Only if the materials were assessed as
extremely significant (human remains or burials)
was construction in the immediate area to be
halted. If a localized work stoppage was required,
the monitoring archaeologist would immediately
call all involved parties (S&GE, THC, SA-OHP,
etc.) to discuss the find and formulate a plan of
action. However, over the course of the project it
was not necessary to implement this emergency
contingency plan.

Cultural Resource Monitoring Investigations for the
J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

In 2003, archaeologists from the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of San
Antonio (CAR-UTSA) conducted a 3-mile linear
survey along Salado Creek on behalf of the COSA
for the Salado Creek Hike and Bike Trail project.
This survey is located approximately 0.21 mile to
the east of the J Street Project area and intersects J
Street Park. The survey consisted of shovel testing
and backhoe trenching investigations. No
archaeological sites were documented during the
2008 survey, and it was recommended that the
proposed project proceed as planned (Weston et. al
2004).

SWCA conducted a non-collection investigation.
Artifacts were to be tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts were to be
described in detail and photographed in the field.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that no
previously conducted surveys or previously
recorded sites are within the project area.
However, one archaeological site and one
previously conducted survey are located adjacent
to the eastern boundary of the project area.
Additionally, seven previously conducted survey
investigations, two archaeological sites, three
cemeteries, and one historic marker are located
within a 1-mile radius of the project area.

In 2007, an area survey was conducted 0.44 mile
to the southeast of the project area. This survey
was conducted by URS Corporation on behalf of
TxDOT for a bridge replacement project at U.S.
Highway 87 and Salado Creek. No archaeological
sites were documented, and it was recommended
that the project proceed as planned (Ahr 2008).

One archaeological site is located adjacent to the
eastern border of the project area. Site 41BX64 is
an Archaic campsite consisting of a lithic and
burned rock scatter mixed with historic artifacts
dating to the early twentieth century. The site was
recorded in 1971 during the New City Park project
(now J Street Park) on behalf of the City of San
Antonio (COSA) and Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (Atlas 2014). Atlas lists the survey as
being conducted in 1973 under the Heritage
Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS). The
eligibility determinations were not reported on the
site form; however, the THC Atlas determination
lists the site as eligibility undetermined as of 2000
(Atlas 2014).

Also conducted in 2007, was an area survey
approximately 0.96 mile to the northeast of the
project area. Raba-Kistner Consultants, Inc., on
behalf of SAWS and K.M. Ng & Associates,
conducted a survey for the installation of three
siphon stations along Salado Creek. Although
archaeological sites 41BX594 and 41BX1678
were revisited during the 2007 survey, no cultural
materials were observed within the project APE.
Additionally, no new archaeological sites were
documented (Held and Darnell 2008).
In 2008, CAR-UTSA conducted backhoe
trenching and monitoring investigations at the
intersection of Salado Creek and Interstate
Highway 10 (IH 10), for the Salado Creek Hike
and Bike Trail project. Backhoe trenching was
executed, but no archaeological sites or cultural
deposits were identified (Figueroa 2008).

Previous survey investigations within a 1-mile
radius of the project were conducted for a variety
of entities including SAWS, TxDOT, and COSA.
Limited information was available on Atlas for
two surveys conducted in 1979 and 1983. The
1979 area survey is approximately 0.8 mile to the
west of the project area. This survey was
conducted on behalf of HCRS and encompasses
approximately 3 acres. No further information on
the 1979 survey is available on Atlas (2014). The
1983 linear survey is approximately 0.67 mile
southeast of the project and no further information
on the survey was available on Atlas (2014).

In 2009, archaeologists from GTI Environmental,
Inc. recorded two sites during survey
investigations on behalf of COSA for additional
work on the Salado Creek Hike and Bike Trail
(Atlas 2014). Sites 41BX1832 and 41BX1833 are
located approximately 0.97 mile north of the
project area along Salado Creek near IH 10. Site
41BX1832, or the Alsbury site, is a homestead
complex consisting of a historic artifact scatter and

5

J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

pier foundation dating to the late nineteenth
century (Atlas 2014). GTI determined site
41BX1882 as eligible for NRHP and SAL
designation, and recommended that an avoidance
strategy be taken (Atlas 2014). Site 41BX1833 is a
prehistoric lithic scatter with a burned rock
midden and pit feature. Cultural materials from the
site consisted of lithic fragments, a biface
fragment, and charcoal. GTI recommended an
avoidance strategy of site 41BX1883, or further
testing if an avoidance strategy was not possible
(Atlas 2014). The eligibility status for both sites
was reported as unknown and further work was
recommended (Atlas 2014).

1887 Rullman Bexar County map depict the
project area within the original land parcel of
Ignacio Perez, Grantee No. 93. A 1903 USGS San
Antonio topographic map indicates the project
area is within a rural setting within no historic
structures east of the city center of San Antonio
proper. A 1927 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers East
San Antonio topographic map depicts J Street and
encroaching development of the surrounding area.
The 1953 Army Map Service topographic map
depicts the project area within J Street with
residential buildings adjacent to the southern
boundaries. No historic resources are depicted
within the project area APE.

Approximately 0.62 mile to the southeast of the
project area, SWCA conducted a survey in 2014
on behalf of Pape-Dawson Engineers for the
Roland Avenue San Antonio Independent School
District Transportation Facility Project. The survey
investigations of the 39-acre project area
determined that the entire area had been highly
disturbed from landform modifications, the
installation of city utility lines, and intensive
refuse dumping from the local community. No
archaeological sites were documented and no
further work was recommended for the 2014
project area (Ward 2014).

Historic aerial photography dating to 1955, 1963,
1966,
and
1973
were
examined
on
Historicaerials.com. The 1955 and 1963 aerial
depict the project area within J Street surrounded
by undeveloped parcels and single-family
homesteads to the south. J Street is depicted as a
narrow gravel two-track road. By 1966, residential
development is encroaching from the east and
north towards the project area. On the 1973 aerial,
J Street is paved and residential subdivisions are
constructed north and south of J Street with J
Street Park at the eastern terminus.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING

In addition to sites 41BX1832 and 481BX1833
and previous surveys, three cemeteries and one
historic marker are located within a 1-mile radius
of the project area. Approximately 0.47 mile
southeast of the project area is a Texas Centennial
Marker commemorating the site of Stephen F.
Austin’s camp (October 20–26, 1835) where
troops were assembled prior to the attack on the
Mexican garrison in San Antonio. The Calvary
Cemetery, Holy Spirit and Mary Immaculate
Cemetery, and Eastview Cemetery are located 0.67
mile northwest, 0.84 mile northwest, and 0.87 mile
south of the project area, respectively. Additional
information on the cemeteries was not available on
Atlas (2014).

SWCA conducted monitoring investigations for
the SAWS water line replacement trench and
associated tie-ins of the J Street Project on June
12, 16, 19, 20, and 23, 2014. Excavations for the
SAWS water line trench began at the intersection
of Pecan Valley and J Street and extended to the
east towards the J Street Park parking lot (Figure
3). Five service line tie-in trenches of various
lengths were then excavated near the intersections
of J Street and Pecan Valley Drive, J Street and
Adamston Drive, J Street and Amberson Drive,
and within the J Street Park parking lot. Portions
of the excavations were not monitored by SWCA
due to the presence of existing utilities and
disturbances, per SAWS and construction plans.
No cultural materials or features were observed
during archaeological monitoring investigations.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
SWCA reviewed historic maps on the TxDOT
Historic Overlay dating to 1871, 1887, 1903, and
1927, and 1953 (Foster et al. 2006). The 1871
General Land Office Bexar County map and the

gravelly clay loam with 30 to 50 percent chert and
limestone gravel inclusions.

Excavations began on the western 580 feet of the
SAWS water line trench (Figure 4 and 5).
Construction crews excavated portions of the
western end and trenches were set and filled
(Appendix A Progress Reports). The western
portion of the project area is located within an
upland setting that gently slopes to the eastsoutheast and is not considered to be an area of
high probability for cultural material. The
excavations of the service line tie-ins within the
western portion (described below) confirm areas
of disturbance and upland deposits consisting of

The remaining eastern 220 feet of the project area
was fully monitored by an SWCA archaeologist
(Figure 6 and 7). The excavations at the eastern
end began at the intersection of Amberson Drive
and J Street, extending east into the J Street Park
parking lot. The eastern portion of the project area
is located within the lower terrace of the unnamed
tributary of Salado Creek to the east. This area was
considered to be an area of high probability for
cultural material due to its proximity to 41BX64
and the unnamed tributary.

J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

Trenching activates consisted of the removal of the
upper layers of city street asphalt with a backhoe
followed by the removal of approximately 5 feet
of soil matrix. The average soil profile for the
SAWS water line trench (Figure 8) consisted of:


0 to 1 feet below surface: asphalt and
construction fill.



1 to 3 feet below surface: Dark gray
brown clay with 30 percent rounded chert
and limestone gravel inclusions.



3 to 5 feet below surface: Yellowish brown
clay with 50 percent rounded chert and
limestone, gravel and cobble inclusions.

Figure 8. Average profile of trench walls, facing
north.

Once a depth of 5 feet was reached, 4 to 6 inches
of base gravel was layered into the bottom of the
trench and a 20-foot segment of the new water line
pipe was set in place. The pipe was then covered
with an additional layer of base gravel and filled in
with spoils from excavation (Figure 9). The
process was repeated until the end of the line was
reached. Trenching activities for the SAWS water
line were terminated within the J Street Park
parking lot, adjacent to an existing manhole.
Two disturbances were observed on the eastern
end of the SAWS water line trench. The first
consisted of a 6-foot-wide segment of disturbed
soils that spanned the entire width of the trench,
approximately 40 feet from the eastern end of the
project area (Figure 10). This disturbance is the
result of an existing water line that parallels the
SAWS water line trench. The second disturbance
is a vertical iron pipe that is associated with the
previously mentioned existing line (Figure 11).
This pipe was exposed in the southern profile of
the SAWS water line trench, approximately 30 feet
from the eastern end of the project area.

J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

Overall, the eastern 220 feet of the SAWS water
line trench that was monitored was observed to be
within an area of intact soil deposits. Only two
small portions of disturbance from existing utility
lines were observed. The intact soils consisted of
gravelly clay loam with 30 to 50 percent chertlimestone gravel and cobble inclusions. No
cultural materials or features were documented
during the excavation of the SAWS water line
trench.
TIE-IN TRENCH NO. 1
Tie-In Trench No. 1 is located approximately 30
feet to the east of the of Pecan Valley Drive and J
Street intersection (Figure 12). The service line
tie-in is located atop an upland slope overlooking
the unnamed tributary of Salado Creek to the east.
The trench measures approximately 6 feet long by
3 feet wide, and extends to the south from the
SAWS main water line trench. The depth of Tie-In
No. 1 is approximately 5 feet and was excavated
into disturbed soils from an existing utility line
(Figure 13). No cultural materials or features were
observed.

line, facing south.

TIE-IN TRENCH NO. 2
Tie-In Trench No. 2 is located at the intersection
of Pecan Valley Drive and J Street at the western
end of the project area (Figure 14). The trench is
also located atop an upland slope overlooking the
unnamed tributary of Salado Creek to the east.
Tie-In Trench No. 2 measures approximately 30
feet in length starting at Pecan Valley on the north
side of the J Street ROW. The trench extends to the
east for 20 feet before redirecting to the southeast
for another 10 feet and connecting to the SAWS
water line trench. The trench measured 5 feet deep
by 3 feet wide. The first 20 feet of the trench was
excavated within an existing utility line (Figure
15). The remaining 10 feet of trench was
excavated into intact soil deposits consisting of
light yellowish brown clay loam with 20 percent
rounded gravel inclusions (Figure 16). No cultural
materials or features were observed in Tie-In
Trench No. 2.

J Street: Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio Water System Project

TIE-IN TRENCH NO. 3
Tie-In Trench No. 3 is located at the intersection
of J Street and Amberson Drive on the eastern half
of the project area. The trench was excavated in
two sections to accommodate residential street
traffic. Measuring approximately 28 feet in total
length, the trench is located on the upper terrace
associated with the unnamed tributary of Salado
Creek to the east. Starting at the SAWS main water
line trench, the line extends to the north with a
width of 3 to 4 feet and a depth of 4 to 6 feet.
Approximately 19 feet of the trench is within
intact soil deposits consisting of dark gray brown
clay with 30 percent rounded chert and limestone
gravel inclusions (Figure 17). The remaining
northern 9 feet of the trench shifts northeast and
was excavated into mostly disturbed soils from
existing utility lines and landscaping for a
residential lawn (Figure 18). No cultural deposits
or features were observed.

TIE-IN TRENCH NO. 4
Tie-In Trench No. 4 is located at the intersection
of J Street and Adamston Drive, on the western
half of the project area (Figure 19). Trench No. 4
was also excavated in two sections to
accommodate residential street traffic. The trench
is located atop an upland slope overlooking the
unnamed tributary of Salado Creek. Tie-in Trench
No. 4 spurs from the SAWS main water line trench
to the north for a length of 18 feet, a width of 3
feet wide, and a depth of 6 feet. An existing utility
line transects the medial point of the trench
diagonally (Figure 20). Aside from the existing
utility line, a majority of the trench was excavated
into intact yellowish brown clay loams with 30 to
40 percent rounded chert and limestone gravel and
cobble inclusions. An abundant amount of
machine crushed chert was also observed, but no
definitive cultural materials or cultural features
were documented.

Trench No. 2, facing south.

The northern section of Tie-In Trench No. 4 was
not monitored during excavation. Per SAWS and
construction plans, the additional northern
excavations of Tie-In Trench No. 4 were within
existing utility trenches and did not warrant
archaeological monitoring. The additional length
and depth for the northern portion is unknown.

TIE-IN TRENCH NO. 5
Tie-In Trench No. 5 is located on the eastern end
of the project area, within the J Street Park parking
lot (Figure 21). The trench sits atop the lower
terrace of the unnamed tributary of Salado Creek.
The proposed work for Tie-In Trench No. 5
involves the replacement of the existing manhole
(see Figure 3) with a new, larger manhole casing,
in addition to a tie-in trench that will connect the
SAWS main water line trench with the new
manhole. The dimensions of the manhole and tiein trench are unknown, but the tie-in trench is
estimated to be 6 feet in length. The excavations
for Tie-In Trench No. 5 and the manhole were not
monitored by SWCA. Per SAWS, the excavations

would be within existing utility trenches

warrant archaeological monitoring.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of S&GE, LLC, SWCA conducted
cultural resources monitoring for the J Street:
Pecan Valley Drive to Dead End San Antonio
Water System Project located in east San Antonio,
Bexar County, Texas. The proposed project
consisted of the replacement and installation of a
sewer and water line within J Street. The
investigations were done to satisfy requirements of
the Antiquities Code of Texas as well as the
Historic Preservation and Design Section of the
City of San Antonio’s Unified Development Code.
The monitoring activities were conducted to
comply with the SA-OHP request for
archaeological investigations due to the close
proximity of the J Street Project to previously
recorded site 41BX64 to the east of the project
area. SWCA investigations consisted of a
background review and archaeological monitoring.

SWCA conducted monitoring investigations for
the SAWS water line replacement trench and
associated tie-ins of the J Street Project on June
12, 16, 19, 20, and 23, 2014. Trenching
excavations for the SAWS main water line began
at the intersection of Pecan Valley and J Street and
extended to the east towards the J Street Park
parking lot. Five service line tie-in trenches of
various lengths were then excavated near the
intersections of J Street and Pecan Valley Drive,
Adamston Drive and Amberson Drive, and within
the J Street Park parking lot. Portions of the
excavation identified by SAWS as being within
existing utility lines and disturbance were not
monitored by SWCA. The excavations revealed
disturbances related to existing utilities within
most of the project area. Portions of the
excavations within undisturbed soils consisted of
gravelly clay loam with 30 to 50 percent chert and
limestone gravel inclusions. Overall, no significant
cultural deposits were encountered during the
monitored excavations of the project area.

The impacts were limited to the excavation and
installation of the SAWS water line and were
conducted within a 30-foot temporary workspace
entirely within the J Street ROW. Additional
excavations for a replacement SAWS sewer line
for the J Street Project were excavated entirely
within existing utility trenches and did not require
archaeological monitoring. SWCA monitored
portions of the new excavations related to the
SAWS water line.

The proposed undertaking will have no effects on
any significant cultural resources within the APE
down to 6 feet and SWCA recommends no further
archaeological investigations. In the event that
previously undiscovered archaeological remains
are discovered during construction, SWCA
recommends further coordination with the SA­
OHP. No artifacts were collected; thus, nothing
was curated.

The APE for the J Street Project area was
approximately 900 feet long, 3 feet wide, and
maximally 6 feet deep within the existing J Street
ROW. In addition, approximately 100 feet of
associated service line tie-in trenches were
excavated to connect to the main water line. The
majority of the project was open trenched within
the 30-foot-wide J Street ROW which included
temporary construction impacts. Thus, the APE
encompassed 0.06 acres and involved up to 600
cubic yards of disturbance.
The background review determined that no
previously conducted surveys or previously
recorded sites are within the project area. One

29429 SAWS J Street Monitoring - Progress Report 06.12 and 06.16

Jim, �
Just wanted to keep you posted on our monitoring progress: �
06.12
Crew had completed approximately 580 feet of the water line trench the day before on 06.11.12. We were informed of
the excavations late in the afternoon of 06.11.12 so we were unable to visit to conduct the monitoring. The excavated
portions of the trench had already been set and filled, so no spoils or trench walls were available for inspection.
Overview photos were taken of the project area. Monitoring was conducted on the eastern portion of the water line
excavations from Amerbson Drive to J Street Park parking lot. The spoil piles and walls of the excavations were examined
and inspected. No cultural resources materials were encountered.
06.16
Crews were anticipating to conduct excavations of the manhole water line tie-in at the eastern end of the line, and two
additional tie-ins at Amberson Drive and Pecan Valley Drive. However, the manhole excavations were delayed as the
foreman determined the proposed new manhole is the incorrect size for installation. He called to retrieve a new
manhole of the correct size but he informed us that it would not be ready for a several days. He said he will call us when
they will proceed with excavations for the water line tie-ins at Amberson Drive and Pecan Valley Drive, as well as the
manhole excavations. These excavations will likely not be conducted until Thursday or Friday of this week.
Although we missed most of the eastern portion of the excavations of the water line, it is in a relatively low probability
area for cultural resources as it is upland and approximately 500-300 feet west from the existing known cultural
resource.
Mr. Ruben Navarro the foreman will let us know when the proceed with excavations for the water line tie-ins at the
manhole, and remaining streets.
If you have any questions, please let us know. Thanks!!!

29429 SAWS J Street Monitoring - Progress report 6.19, 6.20, and 6.23 and CHANGE
ORDER
CO1_29429_J Street Monitoring-2days.pdf

Jim, �
Please find below the progress report for the monitoring excavations on the J Street project. The construction crew has �
two water line tie-ins left to complete. We initially scheduled 5-days of monitoring for the project and today was the last �
monitoring day. Based on the rate of excavations, the water line tie-in excavations will be completed in two days. �
6.19
Monitoring was conducted at western end of the project at the intersection of Pecan Valley and J Street for two tie-in
trenches for the water line. One of the trenches was entirely within existing disturbances from previous utility lines. The
second trench was partially within existing disturbances, with the remaining portions within undisturbed soil. The
undisturbed soils consisted of clay loams. No cultural resources were encountered or identified during construction.
6.20
Monitoring was conducted at two water line tie-in locations at J Street and Amberson and J Street and Adamston. The
majority of the new excavations were within disturbed soils primarily near the intersections. The trenches extended
north at Amberson and Adamston but were not completed. No cultural resources were encountered or identified during
construction.
6.23
Monitoring was completed at the northern portion of the one of the water tie-in location at Amberson Street. Most of
the work was within the street ROW, with the exception of the northern most end which was within residential lot.
Excavations were expanded at this location to help create a bracing/support frame for the pipe. Most of the excavations
was within previously disturbed soils. No cultural resources were encountered or identified during construction.
The remaining work on Adamston and the manhole tie-in at J Street Park parking lot will be completed tomorrow
(Tuesday and/or Wednesday).
Please find attached a SWCA change order of the additional two days of monitoring for the completion of the water line
excavations. Please let me know if this would suffice since the initial contract is under a S&CE, LLC services agreement.
