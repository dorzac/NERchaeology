AbstrAct
On behalf of Hill Country Telephone Cooperative, Inc. (HCTC), SWCA archaeological surveys for the Zones 1–5 Fi­
ber Project in Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kerr, Bandera, Uvalde, Real, Kimble, Edwards, Kendall, Menard, and Medina
counties, Texas. The project includes the installation of hundreds of miles of telecommunications cables and spare ducts
to be buried along various routes. The HCTC Zones 1–5 project area comprises 78 individual routes and roughly 335
miles. The investigations were conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) for the project is 10 feet wide with a depth of impact of 3–4 feet. The fiber optic cables will be installed within
both public-owned (Texas Department of Transportation, county, city) right-of-way (ROW), and private property. Those
sections of the proposed project area that traverse private property were not surveyed for cultural resources.
The purpose of the intensive investigations was to identify any prehistoric and historic cultural resources, establish verti­
cal and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site for designation
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). All work was done in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 4952, with Kevin A. Miller serving
as Principal Investigator. The investigations included a background literature and records review along with reconnais­
sance and intensive pedestrian survey with systematic shovel test excavations. Specifically, the THC stipulated that
investigations focus on the portions of the fiber alignments located within 500 meters of drainages that exhibited little
to no disturbance and contained soils.
Investigations covered 21 separate project areas grouped into zones (Zones 1–5) based on their geographic locations.
Individual project areas varied from a few miles in length to over 20 miles of proposed cable installation. The results
of the survey efforts from the individual project areas were compiled into interim survey reports and were submitted
intermittently to the THC for review and interim clearance.
The cultural resources survey throughout Zones 1–5 covered a total of 251.78 miles and included the excavation of a
total of 1,264 shovel tests. Overall, the survey documented a total of 29 new archaeological sites and revisited 10 previ­
ously recorded archaeological sites extending into the various project APEs. None of the sites documented as a result of
the survey effort were delineated beyond the public ROW boundary. In total, 33 of the 39 documented sites are recom­
mended as ineligible for designation as an SAL. This is due primarily to the disturbed contexts of the sites, overall lack
of diagnostic artifacts or intact features, little preservation potential, and lack of buried, intact cultural deposits. SWCA’s
intensive archaeological survey determined that these cultural resources will not be adversely impacted by the proposed
construction activities within the APE.
The six remaining sites were determined to have potentially significant cultural deposits that warrant further investiga­
tions. Given the scope of the project, the survey-level efforts were not extensive enough to adequately assess the sig­
nificance of these sites, and such the SAL eligibility status’ were considered undetermined. The sites with undetermined
SAL eligibility include 41BN104, 41BN213, 41BN218, 41GL403, 41GL408, and 41MS68. HCTC has agreed to avoid
impacts to these sites through directional boring. As such, these sites will not be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
In conclusion, SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations within the roughly 250-miles of fiber APE
or in the locations of the 39 archaeological resources.

AcknowledgMents
The successful completion of this long and complex project would not have been possible without the efforts and assis­
tance of a host of individuals. First and foremost, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) would like to thank Mr.
James Heimann of Hill Country Telephone Cooperative, Inc. (HCTC). Mr. Heimann served as the main point of contact
for the project, providing maps, administrative direction, critical project information, and guidance through the course
of the investigations. Mr. Heimann’s abundant assistance was instrumental in the success of the project. SWCA would
also like to thank all other individuals at HCTC who helped facilitate our work during the project.
At SWCA, numerous individuals contributed to the project over the course of the two years of surveys. Kevin A. Miller
served as Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the duration of the project, ably overseeing overall logistics
and organization, participating in field surveys, and managing reporting and agency consultation. Several individuals
served as Project Archaeologist or Field Directors over the course of the project, including Eric R. Oksanen, Michael R.
Chavez, Mary Jo Galindo, Ken Lawrence, Matthew C. Stotts, John D. Lowe, Daniel Culotta, and Abigail Peyton. These
folks managed route-specific logistics, project administration, directed field surveys, performed lab research, produced
interim reports, and documented sites. Their hard work and excellent performance both in the field and the office/lab
were the primary reason for the project success. Carole Carpenter expertly produced all field and report maps for the
project and Lindsey Naslenas skillfully handled editing, formatting, and report production tasks on the project. Finally,
SWCA would like to thank the many individuals who served as field or lab crew on the surveys, working in often difficult
conditions but keeping positive and enthusiastic while conducting excellent archaeological work, including Christian
T. Hartnett, Christina Nielsen, Julie McGilvray, Mercedes C. Cody, Stacey Buchanan, David Wilcox, Joshua Haefner,
Jason Newton, Lana Martin, Andrew Boyles, Delfin Weis, Curtis Dusek, Taylor Doran, Greg Sunborg, Kevin Stone,
Diamond Kapanday, Adam Thompson, and Chris Arrendondo.

IntroduCtIon

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) was contracted
by Hill Country Telephone Cooperative, Inc. (HCTC) to
conduct archaeological surveys on the Zones 1–5 Fiber Proj­
ect in Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kerr, Bandera, Uvalde, Real,
Kimble, Edwards, Kendall, Menard, and Medina counties,
Texas. (Figure 1.1). The project includes the installation of
hundreds of miles of telecommunications cables and spare
ducts to be buried along various routes. The HCTC Zones
1–5 project area comprises 78 individual routes and roughly
335 miles (Table 1.1). The investigations were conducted
to fulfill a request by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) that portions of the project alignments be assessed
by a professional archaeologist for compliance with the
Texas Antiquities Code. In their review of the project dated
April 18, 2008, the THC recommended that “a qualified
archaeologist examined the segments of the routes within
500 m of creeks and rivers. Since many routes parallel
creeks, this included a large proportion of the proposed
lines.” To comply with this mandate, HCTC and SWCA
examined routes prior to field surveys, determined which
portions are within 500 m of a waterway, and delineated
survey areas based on this criteria as well as the presence
of existing archaeological sites.

projeCt desCrIptIon

The THC mandate only applied to routes that traversed
lands controlled by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) or other political entities such as counties or cit­
ies, No private property was surveyed as part of the project
The THC required little to no inspection of low probability
areas (i.e., areas with previous disturbance, steep slopes, or
rocky uplands). All work was done in accordance with the
standards and guidelines of the Antiquities Code of Texas.

HCTC issued 21 work authorizations to SWCA, each of
which are designated as separate project areas. The project
areas were grouped into zones based on their geographic
locations (see Figure 1.1). Each route package varied in
length, from a few miles to over 20 miles of proposed
cable installation. For the most part, these routes traversed
rural county roads and TxDOT roadways. The results of
the survey efforts from the individual project areas were
subsequently compiled into interim survey reports and were
submitted intermittently to the THC for review and interim
clearance under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4952.

The work began in June 2008 and concluded in December
2009. SWCA conducted a combination of reconnaissance
and intensive linear pedestrian survey with subsurface
work along the routes. The goal of the work was to identify
archaeological sites, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the individual
projects, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of
any affected site for eligibility for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). This final report is the
last component of the project. Kevin A. Miller served as
the Principal Investigator while the investigations were
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4952.

The project Area of Potential Effects (APE) is over 300
miles in length spread out over numerous routes, 10 feet
wide, and maximally 3–4 feet deep. For installation of the
cables, the width of the ditch will be 8 inches with an ac­
companying 10-foot-wide swath of surficial disturbance by
equipment. Depth of the cable trench will be 36–48 inches
maximum. Contractor will use plows, rippers, rock saws,
trenchers and/or backhoes to install the cable.
Directional or conventional bores will be utilized at various
locations before or coinciding with the installation of the
cable. There will be bores under highways, roads, trees and
flowing waters. The cable installation will be accomplished
by plowing the ground. If the ground is too hard to complete
the plowing, then it will be proceeded by ripping the ground
before the start of plowing. If the ground is too hard to rip,
rock saws will be used. The installation of the cable will
then proceed. After the cable is installed, the ditches will
be back filled and compacted. Then the disturbed area will
be graded to original contours and have permanent seeding.
Cleanup and final grading shall be completed as soon as
possible after completing the backfill.

Methodology
Prior to the initiation of any field surveys, SWCA conducted
a thorough review of each individual fiber route. This review
had two components, 1) a review of previously surveyed
areas and recorded cultural resources, and 2) an evaluation
of the project environmental variables and water crossings.
Both fed into the delineation of archaeological survey ar­
eas along the route. The areas delineated for survey were
within approximately 500 meters of waterways and in areas
known to or likely to contain archaeological sites. With

these parameters, in many cases the majority, if not all, of
a route was surveyed or evaluated. In other cases, sections
of a route were excluded from survey, typically due to the
presence of extensive uplands or heavy disturbances from
roadway construction.
For the background research, an SWCA archaeologist
searched site files, records, and maps files housed at the
Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
the THC Library. Additionally, an SWCA archaeologist
searched the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
database for any previously recorded surveys and historic
or prehistoric archeological sites located in or near the
project area. In addition to identifying previously recorded
archeological sites, the Atlas review will include the fol­
lowing types of information: National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs), Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Reg­
istered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), cemeteries, and

local neighborhood surveys. SWCA also utilized historic
maps in the Texas Department of Transportation’s Historic
Overlay program to assess the presence of potentially his­
toric resources in or near each project area.
A combination of reconnaissance and intensive survey
was utilized in areas delineated for survey. Reconnais­
sance surveys included a physical inspection of the project
area, including surface sampling and shovel tests and/or
probes, if appropriate, sufficient to assess the character of
archeological resources that may be present in the project
area as a whole. Surface inspection of the project was suf­
ficiently augmented by subsurface inspection in the form
of shovel tests or probes to satisfy THC requirements for
reconnaissance survey. Intensive surveys included 100%
surface inspection augmented by subsurface inspection in
the form of shovel tests and/or mechanical excavations.
Shovel tests were of sufficient in number, size, and depth

4

Chapter 1

to assure satisfaction of THC survey standards for each
individual route project.
The field surveys consisted of teams of SWCA archaeolo­
gists walking the proposed APEs for the project. During
the surveys, the archaeologists examined the ground surface
and erosional profiles for cultural resources. Two general
methods of subsurface explorations were to be utilized dur­
ing the survey, shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The
utilization of methods was keyed to the level of disturbance
of the proposed project and the nature of the soils, geology,
and topography. Logistically, the shovel test survey was
conducted first, allowing the crews to examine proposed
backhoe areas to ensure they need trenching. Using this
technique and considering the nature of the project (shallow
depths for fiber installation, mainly rocky upland terrain),
no areas on any of the 21 fiber projects were identified for
backhoe trenching. All subsurface explorations were to a
depth commiserate with the proposed level of subsurface
impacts for each individual project.
When an archaeological site was encountered in the pro­
posed project area during the investigations, it was explored
as much as possible with consideration to land access
constraints. Sites were assessed in regards to potential
significance so that recommendations could be made for
proper management (avoidance, non-avoidance, or further
work). Additional shovel testing was be conducted per
THC standards at each discovered site to define horizontal
and vertical boundaries. Appropriate State of Texas Ar­
chaeological Site Data Forms were filled out for each site
discovered during the investigations. A detailed plan map
of each site was produced and locations plotted on USGS
7.5 minute topographic maps and relevant project maps.
Shovel testing was used when the project crossed upland
topography with low potential for deeply buried sites (al­
most the entire project). Shovel tests were excavated in
20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or to pre-Holocene
deposits, whichever came first. The matrix was screened
through ¼-inch mesh and the location of each shovel test
was plotted using a GPS receiver, and each test was re­
corded on appropriate project field forms. THC survey
standards call for 16 shovel tests per mile of project area.
Any deviations from this were fully documented. If sites
were encountered, a minimum of six shovel tests was ex­
cavated per site. Shovel tests were excavated to the depth
of project impacts. As mentioned, in all settings in each of
the projects, shovel tests and cutbank examination proved
sufficient to explore to the depths of the project impacts.
Finally, SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. When
discovered, artifacts were documented in the field and re­
placed where they were recovered. Thus no artifacts were
collected or curated.

envIronMental settIng

The HCTC project area covers a 13-county area in central
Texas. While covering a broad area, the project encom­
passes a somewhat uniform environmental setting with
comparable landforms and drainage systems. The majority
of the project routes traverse broad upland, rocky terrain
dissected by small to large waterways. The project area is
situated exclusively within the Edwards Plateau physio­
graphic region in Texas and within the Balconian biotic
region (Blair 1950; Correll and Johnston 1979).
Broadly defined, the geology of the HCTC project is solely
within the Edwards Plateau geologic area. The Edwards
Plateau has a Cretaceous Period beginning that occurred
roughly 144–66 million years ago (Finsley 1996; Hentz
2010 Roberts 1996; Spearing 1991; Swanson 1995). The
plateau formed when shallow seas covered most of Texas
and through the deposits of calcareous animals thick layers
of limestone were slowly constructed (Spearing 1991:9–10,
17). The Cretaceous Period is composed of two subdivi­
sions designated the Lower and Upper Cretaceous periods.
The lower formations are older and primarily occur along
the eastern margins of the plateau. The upper formations
are younger and more prevalent and are found across more
than half the state. The rocks of the Cretaceous formation
consist of sandstone, marl, and limestone with the limestone
becoming more indurated and fractured as it grades upward.
The southern and eastern edges of the Edwards Plateau are
indicated by the Balcones escarpment formed by a fault
zone (Spearing 1991; Swanson 1995). The fault zone, along
the margins of the project area, is believed to have formed
either during a regional uplift in the Miocene 10–20 million
years ago or during an even earlier uplift and the Miocene
uplift served to fault downward the coastal plains (Swanson
1995:28). Regardless, uplift along the Balcones fault has
subsequently caused the edges of the Edwards Plateau to
slowly erode away along waterways (Spearing 1991). This
abrupt separation of the eastern and southern extent of the
Edwards Plateau from the Coastal Plains to the southeast
is clearly demarcated by flat-topped hills with eroded tiers
that early Spanish explorers likened to balconies (balcones)
from which the feature gets the name Balcones Escarpment
(Swanson 1995:28).
The Lower Cretaceous formations include the limestone
and dolomite of the Fort Terrett Member, Glen Rose For­
mation limestone, dolomite, and marl, and limestone of
the Edwards Formation (Barnes 1983). Of these geological

formations, the most extensive within the HCTC project
area is the Glen Rose Formation, which is typically charac­
terized as alternating beds of limestone, dolomite, and marl
that form stair step structures due to differing resistance to
erosion (Barnes 1983).
The Upper Cretaceous deposits consist of limestone and
marl of the Anacacho Limestone; chalk and marl of the
Austin Chalk and Pecan Gap Chalk formations; and marl,
clay, sandstone, and siltstone of the Navarro Group and
Marlbrook Marl formations (Barnes 1983). The most exten­
sive of these formations are the Austin Chalk and Pecan Gap
Chalk groups, which are described as calcareous to highly
calcareous and weathers to form moderately deep soils
(Barnes 1983). Further, contrasting the matrices of Lower
and Upper Cretaceous formations between the Edwards
Plateau and Balcones Escarpment, it is apparent that the
Lower Cretaceous deposits are more resistant to erosion.
Ultimately, these geologic formations have slowly eroded
since their uplift forming the distinct, rocky, thin-soiled
uplands of the Edwards Plateau of today.
Across the 13-county project area, a myriad of soil series
and complexes are present, with the vast majority consisting
of some form of shallow, clay or loam of upland origin. In
many of the zones and routes, bedrock is exposed across
the surface or shallowly buried. However, deeper soils are
present along many of the larger drainages encountered by
the project. For detailed breakdown of soil complexes, se­
ries, and types, the reader is referred to the attached interim
route reports in Appendix A.
The Edwards Plateau is dominated by a mixed live oak
(Quercus virginiana)/Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) wood­
land interspersed with occasional grassy openings. Other
tree species present in low densities throughout upland areas
of the project area include cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia),
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), and some mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Shrub
density varies between low to dense in upland areas. Spe­
cies occurring in low densities include Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), False Indigo (Amorpha fruticosa),
agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly pear (Opuntia
spp.) with thick, mixed grasses in areas (Hudler 2000;
Stein et al. 2003; Tull and Miller 1999; Van Auken 1988).
In contrast, Hudler (2000:102) notes that pollen data recov­
ered from north Bexar County southeast of the project area
determined that prehistoric indigenous flora was generally

6

Chapter 2

more productive than today. This research suggests that
the flora community currently observed in the region is
less abundant and flourishing than it has been over the last
12,000 years (Hudler 2000).
The project area also falls within the Balconian biotic
zone (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 percent of all nonmarine mammal species in Texas exist along the Balcones
Escarpment, the prominent geological feature that marks
the southern and eastern extents of the biotic zone (Neck
1986). Common mammals of the area include white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
eastern pipistrel (Pipistrellus subflavus), eastern fox squir­
rel (Sciurus niger), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus
floridanus), pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), pallid bat
(Antrozous pallidus), valley pocket gopher (Thomomys
bottae), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
badger (Taxidus taxus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatis). Less
common are the predatory mammals including the bobcat
(Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), and gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteous). In addition to these common mammals,
bison (Bison bison), mountain lion (Felis concolor), and
black bear (Ursus americanus) would have been available
prehistorically (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis and
Schmidly 1994; Hudler 2000).
The general reptilian assemblage for the Balconian province
include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata emoryi),
Eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), Yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon flavescan flavescan),
bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), southern leopard frog (Rana
utricularia), and the gulf coast toad (Bufo vallicepus) (Blair
1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Kutac and Caran 1994;
Werler and Dixon 2004).
There are at least 75 species of amphibians and reptiles
listed within the Balconian Province (Blair 1950). Bird
species composition in the project area is fairly diverse
with numerous breeding, migrant, and wintering species
present (Kutac and Caran 1994). Common species both
migratory and resident found in the area include bobwhite
quail (Colinus virginianus), northern cardinal (Cardinalis
cardinalis), wood duck (Aix sponsus), canvasback (Aythy
valisineria), tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor), Berwick’s
wren (Thryomanes bewickii), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos),
red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), wild turkey (Melagris
gallopavio), and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) (Hudler
2000:20; Kutac and Caran 1994).

Chapter 3

Cultural settIng

IntroduCtIon
The five zones composing the HCTC project area fall within
the Central Texas archaeological region. Although the
archaeological regions are not absolute, they do generally
reflect recognized biotic communities and physiographic
areas in Texas (Perttula 2004:6). The Central Texas ar­
chaeological region, as its name implies, is situated in the
center of Texas and covers the Edwards Plateau and portions
of the Blackland prairie east of the Edwards Plateau. The
HCTC project area entirely encompasses the Central Texas
archaeological region. The following regional synopsis
provides a basic culture history of the region.

prehIstorIC Cultural hIstory
The following prehistoric cultural history derives its infor­
mation from several central Texas regional chronologies:
Black (1989), Collins (2004), and Johnson and Goode
(1994), which build upon the seminal efforts of Suhm
(1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Furthermore, significant
archaeological sites within the Central Texas archaeological
region and the Edwards Plateau have contributed important
information to understanding prehistory.
The following prehistoric cultural sequence is divided into
three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric.
The Historic period follows the Late Prehistoric, announc­
ing the arrival of Europeans to central Texas. The Archaic
period is subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle,
Late, and Transitional.

Paleoindian Period
Human occupation of the Central Texas archaeological
region is thought to have begun approximately 11,000
years ago. This period correlates with the end of the late
Pleistocene, the last ice age in North America. These early
Texans are characterized by small but highly mobile bands
of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. However, recently researchers have indicated
that Paleoindians probably used a much wider array of re­
sources than previously argued (Bever and Meltzer 2007;
Bousman et al. 2002; Bousman et al. 2004; Dering 2007;
Meltzer and Bever 1995), including small fauna and plant
foods. Faunal remains from Kincaid Rockshelter and the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support this view (Col­

lins 1998; Collins et al. 1989). Longstanding ideas about
Paleoindian technologies also are being challenged.
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites, and
isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian occupations in the
central Texas region. Although Paleoindian site types are
not extensively documented within most of the project area
counties, they can be generally classified according to broad
site type categories extrapolated from nearby regions. Both
open and protected (rockshelter) types are known. Usually
these sites are near permanent sources of water such as
tributary creeks or springs. Bison kill sites, open and pro­
tected campsites, and non-occupation lithic sites are known
from the Paleoindian period in Texas. Intra-site features
include hearths and isolated burials. The Wilson-Leonard
site (41WM235), 41BX52, and 41BX229 contain stratified
Paleoindian deposits (Hester 1980). The lower component
at the Wilson-Leonard site contained a Paleoindian burial
(Collins et al. 1998).
Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian period into early
and late subperiods. Two projectile point styles, Clovis
and Folsom, are included in the early subperiod. Clovis
chipped stone artifact assemblages, including the diagnostic
fluted lanceolate Clovis point, were produced by bifacial,
flake, and prismatic-blade techniques on high-quality and
oftentimes exotic lithic materials (Collins 1990). Along
with chipped stone artifacts, Clovis assemblages include en­
graved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, and ochre
(Collins 1995:381; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points are
found evenly distributed along the eastern edge of the Ed­
wards Plateau, where the presence of springs and outcrops
of chert-bearing limestone are common (Meltzer and Bever
1995:58). Sites within the area yielding Clovis points and
Clovis-age materials include Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins
et al. 1989) and San Macros Springs (Takac 1991). Analyses
of Clovis artifacts and site types suggest that Clovis peoples
were well-adapted, generalized hunter-gatherers with the
technology to hunt larger game but not solely rely on it.
In a survey of fluted points reported from throughout the
state, Bever and Meltzer (2007:72) identified 151 Clovis
points recovered from the counties comprising the Central
Texas region. Near the project area, a combined 12 Clovis
points have been recorded for Bandera, Gillespie, Kendall,
Kerr, Mason, Medina, and San Saba counties (Bever and
Meltzer 2007:67–69). Bever and Meltzer (2007:91) also
determined that roughly 76 percent of the Clovis point

8

Chapter 3

raw material originated from the Edwards Plateau, but the
distribution suggests the Clovis groups focused off the pla­
teau on the Nueces-Guadalupe Plain in the southern Texas.
In contrast, Folsom tool kits—consisting of fluted Folsom
points, thin unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces,
and end scrapers—are more indicative of specialized hunt­
ing, particularly of bison (Collins 2004:117). Folsom point
distributions, both their frequency and spatial patterning,
differ from the Clovis patterns, suggesting a shift in adapta­
tion patterns (Bever and Meltzer 2007; Meltzer and Bever
1995:60, 74). Folsom points appear more frequently in the
coastal plain as well as the South Texas plain, located to the
south and southeast of the project area counties. As Folsom
points are almost exclusively found in plains settings (they
are conspicuously lacking in the Edwards Plateau), the
technology perhaps marks a more specialized adaptation,
likely to a more intensive reliance on bison antiquus.
However, it warrants mentioning that nine of the 12 Clo­
vis points previously mentioned in Bever and Meltzer’s
(2007:69) study were located in Kendall, Kerr, and Me­
dina counties along the southern margins of the plateau.
Comparatively, the remaining counties contained only
one Clovis point or less (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67–69).
The discrepancy in Clovis frequency as well as the Folsom
points between these counties and their physiographic
regions may be attributed to the amount of investigations
conducted in these areas rather than a cultural phenomenon.
Regardless, further investigations are needed to determine
if this discrepancy reflects a specialized adaptation, a lack
of investigations, or a combination of these possibilities.
Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the archaeological
record are a series of dart point styles (primarily unfluted
lanceolate darts) for which the temporal, technological, or
cultural significance is unclear. Often, the Plainview type
name is assigned these dart points, but Collins (2004:117)
has noted that many of these points typed as Plainview do
not resemble Plainview type-site points in thinness and
flaking technology. Investigations at the Wilson-Leonard
site (see Bousman 1998) and a statistical analysis of a
large sample of unfluted lanceolate points by Kerr and
Dial (1998) have shed some light on this issue. At WilsonLeonard, the Paleoindian projectile point sequence includes
an expanding-stem dart point termed Wilson, which dates
to ca. 10,000–9,500 b.p. Postdating the Wilson compo­
nent is a series of unfluted lanceolate points referred to as
Golondrina-Barber, St. Mary’s Hall, and Angostura, but
their chronological sequence is poorly understood. None­
theless, it has become clear that the artifact and feature
assemblages of the later Paleoindian subperiod appear to
be Archaic-like in nature and in many ways may represent
a transition between the early Paleoindian and succeeding
Archaic periods (Collins 2004:118).

archaic Period
The Archaic period for the Central Texas archaeological
region dates from ca. 8,800 to 1,300–1,200 b.p. (Collins
2004) and generally is believed to represent a shift toward
hunting and gathering of a wider array of animal and plant
resources and a decrease in group mobility (Willey and
Phillips 1958:107–108). In the eastern and southwestern
United States and on the Great Plains, development of
horticultural-based, semi-sedentary to sedentary societies
succeeded the Archaic period. In these areas, the Archaic
truly represents a developmental stage of adaptation as
Willey and Phillips (1958) define it. For central Texas,
this notion of the Archaic is somewhat problematic. An
increasing amount of evidence suggests that Archaic-like
adaptations were in place before the Archaic (Bousman et
al. 2002; Collins 2004:117–118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989)
and that these practices continued into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period (Collins 2004:118–119; Prewitt 1981:74).
Effectively, the Archaic period of central Texas is not a
developmental stage, but rather an arbitrary chronological
construct and projectile point style sequence. Establishment
of this sequence is based on several decades of archaeologi­
cal investigations at stratified Archaic sites along the east­
ern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau. Collins
(2004) and Johnson and Goode (1994) have divided this
sequence into three parts—early, middle, and late—based
on perceived (though not fully agreed upon by all schol­
ars) technological, environmental, and adaptive changes.
However, Turner and Hester (1999) and Black (1989) have
designated another period at the end of the Archaic, referred
to as Transitional Archaic or Terminal Archaic.

early arChaIC
The Early Archaic period (8,800–6,000 b.p.) is better docu­
mented than the Paleoindian period, however a complete
understanding of cultural patterns does not yet exist. Early
Archaic sites are small, and their tool assemblages are
diverse (Weir 1976:115–122), suggesting that populations
were highly mobile and densities low (Prewitt 1985:217).
It has been noted that Early Archaic sites are concentrated
along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau (Johnson and Goode 1994; McKinney 1981). This
distribution may indicate climatic conditions at the time,
given that these environments have more reliable water
sources and a more diverse resource base than other parts
of the region.
Artifact assemblages of the Early Archaic include projectile
point styles such as Hoxie, Bulverde, Gower, Wells, Mar­
tindale, and Uvalde, as well as early split stem projectile
points. A variety of choppers and gouges, such as the tri­
angular, concave based bifaces known as Guadalupe tools,
and the distally beveled Clear Fork unifaces are present in

Cultural Setting
the archaeological record. A variety of expediency tools,
often nothing more than utilized flakes, are increasingly
present in the Early Archaic (Black 1989).
The construction and use of rock hearths and ovens, which
had been limited during the Paleoindian period, become
commonplace in the Early Archaic. The use of rock features
suggests that retaining heat and releasing it slowly over an
extended period were important in food processing and
cooking and reflects a specialized subsistence strategy.
Such a practice probably was related to cooking plant
foods, particularly roots and bulbs, many of which must be
subjected to prolonged periods of cooking to render them
consumable and digestible (Black et al. 1997:257; Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical remains, as well as
other organic materials, are often poorly preserved in Early
Archaic sites, so the range of plant foods exploited and their
level of importance in the overall subsistence strategy are
poorly understood. But recovery of charred wild hyacinth
(Camassia scilloides) bulbs from an Early Archaic feature
at the Wilson-Leonard site provides some insights into the
types of plant foods used and their importance in the Early
Archaic diet (Collins 1998).
Significant Early Archaic sites scattered around the Central
Texas region include the Icehouse Site in Hays County (Ok­
sanen 2008), Richard Beene site in Bexar County (Thoms
and Mandel 1992, 2007), the Camp Pearl Wheat and Gatlin
Sites in Kerr County (Collins et al. 1990; Houk et al. 2008),
and the Jetta Court site in Travis County (Wesolowsky et
al. 1976).

MIddle arChaIC
Cultural patterns during the Middle Archaic period (6,000–
4,000 b.p.), point toward an increased sedentary population
intensively harvesting acorns, Yucca “tuna”, and pecans,
and hunting small and medium-size game such as deer and
turkey. The increase in the number of Middle Archaic sites
and burials supports the concept of a larger, more sedentary
population (Black and McGraw 1985; Prewitt 1981:73;
Weir 1976:124, 135). Large bands may have formed at least
seasonally to occupy a single area, or small groups may have
used the same sites for longer periods (Weir 1976:130–131).
Sites of the Middle Archaic are numerous and often large
in size. Burned rock middens are found at many sites with
Middle and Late Archaic components in the Central Texas
archaeological region. The development of burned rock
middens toward the end of the Middle Archaic suggests a
greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply
a considerable dependence on hunting (Prewitt 1985:222–
226). Middle Archaic projectile point styles include Bell,
Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. Other arti­
facts from the Middle Archaic are choppers, gouges, and
expediency tools such as the small, bifacial and unifacial

9

Clear Fork tools. Grinding stones and bases, referred to
as manos and metates, show up in Middle Archaic artifact
assemblages as well as a number of perforators, drills, and
awls. Chipped, polished, and ground stone artifacts are
common in central Texas and surrounding regions. Less fre­
quently encountered artifacts include tools and ornaments
of bone, antler, and marine shell (Turner and Hester 1999).
Bell and Andice points reflect a shift in lithic technology
from the preceding Early Archaic Martindale and Uvalde
point styles (Collins 2004:120). Johnson and Goode
(1994:25) suggest that the Bell and Andice darts are parts
of a specialized bison-hunting tool kit. They also believe
that an influx of bison and bison-hunting groups from the
Eastern Woodland margins during a slightly more mesic
period marked the beginning of the Middle Archaic. Though
no bison remains were recovered, Bell and Andice points
and associated radiocarbon ages were recovered from the
Gatlin Site (Houk et al. 2008), Cibolo Crossing (Kibler and
Scott 2000), Panther Springs Creek, and Granberg II (Black
and McGraw 1985) sites in Bexar County.
The Bison population disappeared as more-xeric condi­
tions returned during the later part of the Middle Archaic.
Later Middle Archaic projectile point styles (Nolan and
Travis) represent another shift in lithic technology (Collins
2004:120–121; Johnson and Goode 1994:27). At the same
time, this shift to drier conditions saw the burned rock mid­
dens develop, probably because intensified use of geophytic
or xerophytic plants meant the debris from multiple rock
ovens and hearths accumulated as middens on stable to
slowly aggrading surfaces, as Kelley and Campbell (1942)
suggested many years ago. Johnson and Goode (1994:26)
believe that the dry conditions promoted the spread of yuc­
cas and sotols that Middle Archaic peoples collected and
cooked in large rock ovens.

late arChaIC
During the succeeding Late Archaic period (4,000 to
1,300–1,200 b.p.), populations continued to increase (Pre­
witt 1985:217). As evidenced by stratified Archaic sites
such as Loeve-Fox, Cibolo Crossing, and Panther Springs
Creek, the Late Archaic components contain the densest
concentrations of cultural materials of all the Archaic
periods. Establishment of large cemeteries along drain­
ages also suggests certain groups had strong territorial ties
(Story 1985:40).
Middle Archaic subsistence technology, including the use
of rock and earth ovens, continues into the Late Archaic
period. Collins (2004:121) states that, at the beginning
of the Late Archaic period, the use of rock ovens and the
resultant formation of burned rock middens reached its
zenith and that the use of rock and earth ovens declined
during the latter half of the Late Archaic. However, mount­

10

Chapter 3

ing chronological data, that midden formation culminated
much later and that this high level of rock and earth oven
use continued into the early Late Prehistoric period (Black
et al. 1997:270–284; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). A picture
of prevalent burned rock midden development in the eastern
part of the Central Texas archaeological region after 2,000
b.p. is gradually becoming clear. This scenario parallels the
widely recognized occurrence of post-2,000 b.p. middens
in the western reaches of the Edwards Plateau.
The use of rock and earth ovens (and the formation of
burned rock middens) for processing and cooking plant
foods suggests that this technology was part of a general­
ized foraging strategy. Considering the amount of energy
involved in collecting plants, constructing hot rock cooking
appliances, and gathering fuel, the caloric return of most
plant foods is relatively low (Dering 1999). This suggests
that plant foods were part of a broad-based diet (Kibler and
Scott 2000:134) or part of a generalized foraging strategy,
an idea Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times during the
Late Archaic, this generalized foraging strategy appears to
have been marked by shifts to a specialized economy fo­
cused on bison hunting (Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137).
Castroville, Montell, and Marcos dart points are elements of
tool kits often associated with bison hunting. Archaeologi­
cal evidence of this association is seen at Bonfire Shelter
in Val Verde County (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), Jonas
Terrace in Medina County (Johnson 1995), Oblate Rockshelter (Johnson et al. 1962:116), John Ischy in Williamson
County (Sorrow 1969), and Panther Springs Creek (Black
and McGraw 1985).

transItIonal arChaIC
As Collins (2004:122–123) notes, diverse and compara­
tively complex archaeological manifestations toward the
end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence of kinds of
human conduct without precedent in the area. This period
(2,250–1,250 b.p.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal Archaic (Black 1989),
is not recognized by all researchers. Other chronologies
terminate the Late Archaic at around 1,200–1,250 b.p. (Col­
lins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994) to encompass this later
subperiod. Johnson et al. (1962) originally designated the
Transitional Archaic as a subperiod of the Archaic because
of the similarities between the latest dart point types and
the earliest arrow point types. Since then, however, the des­
ignation has failed to be universally accepted by research­
ers. In two recent chronologies for central Texas, Collins
(2004) does not include the Transitional as a subperiod of
the Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate the
Late Archaic into two subperiods designated Late Archaic
I and Late Archaic II. The Transitional Archaic, as it is used
here, closely corresponds to Johnson and Goode’s (1994)
Late Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of Marcos

points, not with it. In this scheme, the Transitional Archaic
coincides with the last two style intervals recognized by
Collins (2004) for the Late Archaic subperiod.
During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point forms
such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were developed
(Turner and Hester 1999). These points were probably
ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric arrow point types and
may have overlapped temporally with them (Hester 1995;
Houk and Lohse 1993).
Several researchers believe that the increased interaction
between groups at the end of the Late Archaic was an im­
portant catalyst for cultural change (Collins 2004; Johnson
and Goode 1994). This change may have included increased
regional stress and conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent (Houk et al. 1997). In Bexar County,
for instance, researchers noted a distinct shift in settlement
patterns during this period (Houk et al. 1997). Groups began
to use hilltops as camps rather than just lithic procurement
locations. These elevated locations would have provided
points from which to observe game and other groups of
humans as they moved through the surrounding creek val­
leys and upland prairies (Houk et al. 1997).
Overall, the Archaic period represents a hunting and gather­
ing way of life that was successful and remained virtually
unchanged for more than 7,500 years. This notion is based
in part on fairly consistent artifact and tool assemblages
through time and place and on resource patches that were
used continually for several millennia, as the formation
of burned rock middens show. This pattern of generalized
foraging, though marked by brief shifts to a heavy reliance
on bison, continued almost unchanged into the succeeding
Late Prehistoric period.

late Prehistoric Period
Introduction of the bow and arrow and, later, ceramics into
the Central Texas archaeological region marks the Late
Prehistoric period (1,250–350 b.p.). Population densities
dropped considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not differ greatly
from the preceding period, although bison again became
an important economic resource during the latter part of the
Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt 1981:74). Use of rock and
earth ovens for plant food processing (Black et al. 1997;
Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture came into play very
late in the region but was of seemingly minor importance
to overall subsistence strategies (Collins 1995:385).
Artifact assemblages include Scallorn, Perdiz, and Edwards
projectile points, worked stone, thermally altered stone,
hematite, bone, and shell. The points are associated with the
use of the bow and arrow in the region, probably introduced
sometime around 1,350–1,150 b.p.

Cultural Setting
The earlier Austin phase (identified by Scallorn and Ed­
wards points) and the later Toyah phase (defined through
Perdiz points) divide the Late Prehistoric period throughout
central Texas (Black 1989; Story 1990). These divisions
were originally recognized by Suhm (1960) and Jelks
(1962), and remain an accepted separation of the period.
Although a distinct change in the material culture between
the two phases can be seen in the archaeological record,
there is some debate over the cultural underpinnings that
prompted the change. The different arrow point styles (and
other associated artifacts in the assemblage) may represent
distinct cultural groups (Johnson 1994), but others challenge
this view (e.g., Black et al. 1997), and attribute the change
to a spread of new technological ideas in response to the
increase of a different economic resource in bison popula­
tions (Ricklis 1992). Nevertheless, prehistoric communities
traced through cultural remains assigned to the Austin phase
(1,250–650 b.p.), like many of the Archaic period cultures
before them, relied on a hunting and gathering subsistence
with more of an emphasis on gathering (Prewitt 1981:83).
Communities attributed to the Toyah phase (650–200 b.p.)
relied more on bison procurement (Prewitt 1981:84).
Around 1,000–750 b.p., slightly more-xeric or droughtprone climatic conditions returned to the region, and bison
came back in large numbers (Huebner 1991; Toomey 1993).
Using this vast resource, Toyah peoples were equipped with
Perdiz point-tipped arrows, end scrapers, four-beveled-edge
knives, and plain bone-tempered ceramics. Toyah technol­
ogy and subsistence strategies represent a completely dif­
ferent tradition from the preceding Austin phase. Collins
(1995:388) states that formation of burned rock middens
ceased as bison hunting and group mobility obtained a
level of importance not witnessed since Folsom times.
Although the importance of bison hunting and high group
mobility hardly can be disputed, the argument that burned
rock midden development ceased during the Toyah phase
is tenuous. A recent examination of Toyah-age radiocarbon
assays and assemblages by Black et al. (1997) suggests that
their association with burned rock middens represents more
than a “thin veneer” capping Archaic-age features. Black
et al. (1997) claim that burned rock midden formations,
although not as prevalent as in earlier periods, was part of
the adaptive strategies of Toyah peoples.

hIstorIC Culture hIstory
The Historic period (a.d. 1630 to present) in Texas roughly
begins when Europeans first entered the region. From just
after a.d. 1550 to the late 1600s, European journeys into the
area were rare. Motivated primarily by European politics,
the first Europeans into the project area were probably
Spanish explorers and missionaries. With the exception of
these Spanish expeditions or entradas, Texas during the
early Historic Period was claimed by Spain but basically

11

remained without an established Spanish presence until
around a.d. 1700.
The beginning of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries was an era of more-permanent contact between
Europeans and Native Americans as the Spanish moved
northward out of Mexico to establish settlements and mis­
sions on their northern frontier (see Castañeda [1936–1958]
and Bolton [1970] for extended discussions of the mission
system and Indian relations in Texas and central Texas
region). There is little available information on aboriginal
groups and their ways of life except for the fragmentary
data Spanish missionaries gathered. In the San Antonio area
and areas to the south, these groups have been referred to
collectively as Coahuiltecans because of an assumed simi­
larity in way of life, but many individual groups may have
existed (Campbell 1988). This area also served as a point
of contact between the southward-advancing Apaches and
the Spanish, with native groups often caught in between.
Disease and hostile encounters with Europeans and intrud­
ing groups such as the Apache were already wreaking their
inevitable and disastrous havoc on native social structures
and economic systems by this time.

sPanish colonial/Mexican indePendence
Period (1630–1820s)
The Spanish Colonial period (a.d. 1630–1821) may be
characterized as the initial period of Aboriginal/European
contact and European settlement in Texas. During this time
central Texas was inhabited by several aboriginal groups
including the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, and Lipan Apache
(Thompson 2007). Motivated more by a fear of French
expansion than anything else, the Spanish explored and
established missions in eastern and central Texas during the
latter part of the seventeenth century. These early overland
Spanish entradas utilized established Indian trade routes,
with the first being led by Governor Alonso de Léon (1689
and 1690). José de Urrutia passed through the project area
as the leader of a Spanish campaign against Apaches in
1739. In 1754, Pedro de Rabago y Teran passed through on
his way to the lands surrounding the San Saba River. Other
early Spaniards in the area included Diego Ortiz Parrilla,
who led a campaign against the Apaches in 1759, and the
Marques de Rubi, who led an inspection of the northern
Frontier of New Spain in 1767 (Thompson 2007). In 1808,
Captain Francisco Amangual commanded a military expe­
dition from San Antonio to Santa Fe and mapped a road
that passed through the project area. The expedition was
intended as a show of strength to the Plains Indians.
Establishment of the mission system in the first half of
the eighteenth century to its ultimate demise around 1800
brought the peaceful movement of some indigenous groups
into mission life, but others were forced in or moved in

12

Chapter 3

to escape the increasing hostilities of southward-moving
Apaches and Comanches. Many of the Payaya and Juanca
lived at Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo), but
so many died there that their numbers declined rapidly
(Campbell 1988:106, 121–123). By the end of the mission
period, European expansion and disease and intrusions by
other Native American peoples had decimated many Native
American groups. The small numbers of surviving Payaya
and Juanca were acculturated into mission life. The last
references to the Juanca and Payaya were recorded in 1754
and 1789, respectively, in the waning days of the mission
(Campbell 1988:98, 123). By that time, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Apache, and Comanche had moved
into the region to fill the void. Outside of the missions, few
sites attributable to these groups have been investigated. To
complicate matters, many aboriginal ways of life endured
even after contact with the Spanish. For example, manufac­
ture of stone tools continued even for many groups settling
in the missions (Fox 1979). The nineteenth century brought
the final decimation of the Native American groups and the
United States defeat of the Apaches and Comanches and
their removal to reservations.

rePublic of texas/Pre-civil War (1836–
1860)
During the Republic of Texas era, from 1836–1845, the
Central Texas area remained an Indian stronghold until the
1870s. On December 29, 1845, Congress signed the Texas
Admission Act, the result of several years of annexation de­
bate. A few months later on February 19, 1846, members of
the newly formed state government conducted a ceremony
in front of the Capitol at Austin marking Texas’ official
annexation into the Union and the end of the Republic of
Texas (Campbell 2003:186).

the Post–civil War to tWentieth century
(1865–1950)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruc­
tion period. To begin reconstruction federal troops, in part,
had to spread the word of the Emancipation Proclamation
(Campbell 2003:268). In Galveston on June 19, 1865
General Gordon Granger and the Union army spread the
word of the slaves’ emancipation (Campbell 2003:268).
Thus, this day became known as Juneteenth and has been
celebrated by Texas African Americans ever since (Camp­
bell 2003:268).
Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s, and San
Saba and central Texas counties experienced a period of
“mob rule.” Citizens formed an anti-mob organization,
but competing groups conducted essentially open warfare.
After several people were killed, the Texas Rangers were
dispatched to the area and order was eventually restored.

Recovery during this period was gradual, but was assisted
by a diverse agricultural economy particularly cattle. In the
1870s, several major cattle trails heading to markets passed
through central Texas. One invention that had an affect on
Texas and its economy during this time was barbed wire.
Barbed wire, first demonstrated in 1871, enabled ranchers
to alter land and cattle control to a less-intrusive, more
profitable plan, and brought additional commerce and
trade to central and South Texas. Though barbed wire was
one of the largest influences on Texas in general, the most
influential invention on the region was the railroad. The
railroads effectively served as a means of transportation
and generally bolstered growth in the economies, to varying
degrees, of the region.
Throughout the early twentieth century, trade, transporta­
tion, and tourism continued to bring economic prosperity
to the region. The establishment of military facilities (e.g.,
Fort Sam Houston) and the activity surrounding World
War I and World War II kept the railway system active and
commercial activity in the east prospered.
Through the remainder of the twentieth century, population
in central Texas increased largely attributed to expansion
and commercial opportunities in San Antonio. The construc­
tion of public highways and automobiles facilitated the
commuting of central Texas citizens to urban employment.

survey results for zone 1

zone 1
Zone 1 is located in Kerr and Kendall counties and is
composed of a total of 15 separate routes (Table 4.1, Fig­
ure 4.1). The routes are located in and around the City of
Comfort, Texas and have a total length of approximately
104.05 miles. Within Zone 1, a total of 73.58 miles of
the proposed route alignment were surveyed for cultural
resources, resulting in the documentation of 10 new ar­
chaeological sites and revisit of two sites. The surveys
encountered similar topographic and geomorphic settings
across the routes, generally thin soils across rocky uplands
with moderate to severe disturbances in the project corridors
(Figures 4.2–4.6). These conditions precluded intensive
shovel testing or the need for backhoe trenching on many
of the routes. Survey efforts within Zone 1 took place
between August 2008 and May 2009 and were subdivided
into seven separate field projects. The results of each of
these field projects are detailed in individually submitted
interim reports (Appendix A), however a synopsis of each
investigation is presented here.

projeCt settIng
The Comfort Routes 1F and 2F-22 (Segments 1–3) are
located just west of Comfort, Texas in northwest Kendall
Table 4.1.

County (Figure 4.7). Route 1F, also referred to as Segment
2, begins on the south side of Farm-to-Market (FM) 473,
approximately 600 feet west of Interstate Highway (IH) 10.
The route continues east for approximately 0.7 mile to the
intersection of Flat Rock Creek Road, where it continues
north along the west side of Flat Rock Creek Road for ap­
proximately 2.1 miles. The total length of Comfort Route
1F is 2.8 miles. Outcroppings of Glen Rose Formation
limestone and chert were commonly observed throughout
Segment 2. Soils extending to approximately 65 cm below
surface (cmbs) were noted only within a narrow alluvial
terrace located adjacent to an ephemeral unnamed drainage
crossing. The remainder of Segment 2 was dominated by
shallow gravelly deposits.
Route 2F-22 is approximately 14 miles long and is com­
posed of two separate segments. Segment 1 is approxi­
mately 8 miles long and essentially follows Highway 9 from
its intersection with FM 473 north to its termination point
at Alamo Road. Segment 1 traverses predominantly upland
stream terraces associated with Block Creek, Rafter Hollow
and several smaller streams and unnamed tributaries. These
upland stream crossing are characterized by steep-sided
terraces with little alluvial accumulation. Within the APE,
these terraces were found to be composed of shallow soil
deposits underlain by limestone graves at depths ranging
from 30–40 cmbs. Despite the segment’s proximity to
water sources, there was little potential for encountering
significant buried cultural material because of the upland
setting and lack of preserved alluvial deposits.

Segment 3 takes a westerly route along FM 473 before
turning to the north to follow Upper Sisterdale Road. This
portion of Route 2F-22 is approximately 6 miles long and
terminates at the intersection of Valley View Trail and
Saddlewood Trail. The majority of Segment 3 traverses
undulating uplands, slopes and ridges with little to no top
soils and stair step topography belonging to the Glen Rose
Formation.

The background review determined that six previously
conducted surveys and one archaeological site (41KE148)
are located within or directly adjacent to the current APE.
The most recent survey, which crosses FM 473 just east
of IH 10, was conducted in 2005 by SWCA for a Lower
Colorado River Authority (LCRA) transmission line. The
survey recorded five prehistoric archaeological sites with
the nearest site to the current APE (41KE172) located ap­

Survey Results for Zone 1 17
proximately 500 feet south of the FM 473 right-of-way
(ROW). An additional survey for LCRA in 2004, conducted
by Prewitt and Associates, crosses the project area at two
locations, Flat Rock Creek Road and Highway 9. The survey
did not record any new sites near the current APE. Lone
Star Archeological Services conducted a survey in 1982 for
a 40-acre LCRA transmission facility site located adjacent
to Flat Rock Creek Road, approximately 0.8 mile north of
FM 473. The initial survey recorded three archaeological
sites, 41KE80 through 41KE82, with a reevaluation in 1991
recording sites 41KE128 and 41KE129. Site 41KE128 was
originally incorporated into 41KE80, but was determined
to be a discrete, defined assemblage.
The remaining surveys were conducted by the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD) at the Old Tunnel Wild­
life Management Area along Highway 9, near the northern
extent of the current APE. The archaeological surveys,
conducted in 1995 and 2003, recorded multi-component
site 41KE139 and site 41KE148, a historic scatter. Site
41KE148 is shown to extend into the Highway 9 ROW
and the APE.
Located approximately 100 m south of 41KE129, site
41KE148 is a historic debris scatter of metal and glass arti­
facts that date to the early twentieth century and documented
as possibly being associated with the construction of the
railroad tunnel in 1914. The site is mapped as extending
into the Highway 9 ROW and into the current project APE
and represent a historic-age road-side dumping area.

results of survey
A total of 16.8 miles of the Comfort Routes 1F & 2F-22
were surveyed during the field effort. The remaining 3.2
miles of the alignment will traverse private property, and
as such were not surveyed as a part of this project. Ground
visibility typically exceeded 70 percent along these routes
and the field survey consisted of intermittent shovel testing.
Shovel test intervals were greatly dependent upon the nature
of the landscape, which was often found to be dominated
by shallow soils and frequent bedrock outcroppings. A
total of 84 shovel tests with an average depth of 30 cmbs
were excavated along the Comfort Routes 1F & 2F-22. All
shovel tests were excavated within the public ROW and no
areas of potentially deep deposits likely to harbor intact
archaeological sites were noted. The survey of the Comfort
Routes 1F & 2F-22 resulted in the documentation of two
new prehistoric sites (41KE199 and 41KE200).
Additionally, the location where site 41KE148 is document­
ed as extending into the current project area boundary was
also intensively investigated to determine if any potentially
significant components of the site stand to be impacted by
the proposed undertaking. The intensive survey efforts
in the vicinity of the previously recorded site 41KE148

yielded entirely negative findings. No historic-age features,
artifacts, or debris were noted within or immediately ad­
jacent to the current project area boundaries. As the site is
situated on an upland ridge, it is likely that erosion coupled
with roadway maintenance have stripped away much of the
historic debris from the area.

site 41Ke199
Site 41KE199 is a surficial to shallowly buried scatter of
prehistoric lithic artifacts located along the western ROW
boundary of Highway 9, approximately 2.65 miles north of
FM 473 within Segment 1. The site is located on the edge
of an eroding limestone terrace above Block Creek and is
bisected by an east-west running gravel road. Artifacts re­
corded at the site include a biface fragment, approximately
20 pieces of lithic debitage, and fire-cracked limestone.
Based on the distribution of shovel tests and surface arti­
facts, site 41KE199 has an area measuring approximately
75 m north-south by 7.5 m east-west. The current survey
efforts were restricted to the road ROW, and as such, the
eastern and western boundaries of the site have not been
fully delineated. Non-diagnostic artifacts were noted in five
positive shovel tests to a depth of 15 cmbs with limestone
bedrock encountered at 30 cmbs. Limestone outcrops occur
adjacent to, and within, the site boundary. An estimated 70
percent of the deposits within the APE have been destroyed
as a result of roadway construction, maintenance, and util­
ity installation.
No intact features or diagnostic lithic material was recorded
at the site. The cultural materials occur on the surface and
shallowly buried in the thin mantle of soil overlying the
limestone terrace. The deposits have been subjected to
the effects of erosion, bioturbation, and road construction
and maintenance. Overall, the site has a low probability of
containing significant, intact, archaeological deposits within
the Highway 9 ROW, and its research potential is low. The
site is not recommended for formal designation as a SAL.

site 41Ke200
Site 41KE200 is located along Flat Rock Creek Road in
Segment 2, approximately 0.2 mile north of FM 473. Similar
to site 41KE199, site 41KE200 is a surficial to shallowly
buried prehistoric lithic scatter with burned rock. The site
is located on a broad and level upland terrace on the end
slope of a divide between Flat Rock Creek to the east and
unnamed tributary to the west. Based on the distribution
of shovel tests and surface artifacts, site 41KE200 has an
area measuring approximately 40 m north-south by 4 m
east-west. The current survey efforts were restricted to the
road ROW, and as such, the eastern and western boundaries
of the site have not been fully delineated.

Ground visibility was over 90 percent at the time the site was
recorded. Site 41KE200 contains no diagnostic artifacts and
no intact features were detected. Artifacts including eight
chert flakes, chert shatter, and five burned rock fragments
were noted on the surface and to a depth of 18 cmbs in two
shovel tests. The site is situated on an ancient upland terrace
above the Guadalupe River and the cultural deposits are on
an eroding and deflating surface. Due to the shallow nature
of the underlying bedrock, there is generally a low prob­
ability that significant, intact, buried cultural deposits will
occur within the project APE. Additionally, an estimated 80
percent of the site within the APE has been disturbed by
road construction and maintenance and utility installation.

projeCt settIng
The 5.5-mile Comfort Hasenwinkle Road route is located
north of Comfort, Texas in northeastern Kerr County (Figure
4.8). The route parallels Hasenwinkle Road (also known as
Center Point Road) from approximately 1 mile south of the
Kerr-Gillespie County Line to 2.2 miles north of FM 1431
(Cypress Creek Road). The majority of the route is located
on private property adjacent to the Hasenwinkle Road ROW
with only two small segments (totaling 1.5 miles) within
publicly owned ROW. These two segments were the only
areas investigated with an intensive pedestrian survey.
The two segments within public ROW measure 0.45 mile
and 1.05 miles and are located near the center of the project
area. Ground visibility in the investigated segments was
almost always greater than 70 percent. The field survey
consisted of intermittent shovel test excavations and ground
inspection based upon the local characteristics such as
shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bedrock. All shovel
tests were in the public ROW and were excavated every
100 m within the investigated segments. There were no
areas where backhoe trenching was needed as observed
soil depths did not exceed 70 cm.

The background review determined that no archaeological
sites or previous investigations are located within 1 mile
of the Comfort Hasenwinkle Road route.

results of survey
The investigations consisted of an intensive archaeological
survey along the publicly owned segments of Hasenwinkle
Road ROW within the project area. The survey included the
examination of the ground surface and excavation of shovel

tests. Overall, the majority of the investigated segments of
the APE was found to consist of stairstep topography and
exposed bedrock. In addition, the majority of Hasenwinkle
Road ROW has been shallowly disturbed by road mainte­
nance and construction.
A total of 25 shovel tests was excavated within the 1.5
miles of the Comfort Hasenwinkle Road route that are lo­
cated within the publically-owned ROW. The shovel tests
predominantly encountered shallow gravelly silty clays and
silty loams and averaged 5 cm in depth. Several shovel tests
excavated near Hasenwinkle Creek in the southern portion
of the investigated APE and adjacent to a small hill in the
northern portion of the investigated APE had deeper soils.
Soils in these areas consisted of calcareous silty clays that
ranged in depth from 35–40 cmbs.
Recent road construction and maintenance has disturbed
the length of the investigated portion of the project area.
These disturbances include grading along both sides of
the roadway to the ROW boundary and the excavation of
shallow drainages running parallel to both sides of the road.
Although these disturbances were apparent on the surface,
shovel tests were still performed throughout the investigated
segments. In all, none of the shovel tests or the surficial
investigations encountered cultural materials and no new
archaeological sites were recorded.

projeCt settIng
The archaeological survey for the Sisterdale Routes 5F, 3F
and 2F total 10.5 miles and are located in central Kendall
County, west/northwest of Comfort, Texas (Figure 4.9).
Route 5F begins at the intersection of State Highway (SH)
1376 and Sisterdale-Lindendale Road. It follows the south
side of Sisterdale-Lindendale Road east for 2.25 miles
where it connects with an existing utility. Route 3F is the
longest route and begins just north of the community of
Sisterdale, Texas. The route follows the western portion
of the SH 1376 ROW north for approximately 5.3 miles to
just south of the intersection of Platten Creek Road. Route
2F begins at the intersection of SH 1376 and FM 473 and
follows the south side of FM 473 east for 3.8 miles where
it connects with an existing utility.
Ground visibility was greater than 80 percent over the ma­
jority of the project area. The field survey predominantly
encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bed­
rock. However, shovel test excavations were utilized on a
judgmental basis in the public ROW in areas that displayed

backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths did
not exceed 40 cmbs.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that no previously
recorded archaeological sites or survey are located within
or immediately adjacent to the three Sisterdale routes.
However, the Sisterdale Valley District, a historic district
listed on the NRHP encompasses a large portion of the
project area. The Sisterdale Valley District encompasses
a rectangular 28,930-acre area that includes the western
half of Route 2F, the southern portion of Route 3F up to
Sisterdale-Lindendale Road, and the extreme southern
portion of Route 5F. The district represents one of the first
early German settlements in Texas. The settlement was
founded in 1847 by Nicolaus Zink, a German immigrant
who surveyed New Braunfels for Prince Carl of SolmsBraunfels (Lich 2009). The settlement became one of the
famous Latin Colonies as Zink was joined by other immi­
grants fleeing the aborted 1848 revolution in Europe (Lich
2009; THC Site Form). The Latin Colonies were several
farming settlements founded by small groups of educated
German political refugees throughout central Texas (THC
Site Form). The Latin derives from the popular idea in Ger­
man culture of the time that knowing Latin was considered
to be both “a prerequisite for higher learning and a sign
of educational attainment” (Biesele 2009). The Sisterdale
community, originally known as Zink’s Settlement, was a
center of German abolitionism and Unionism before and
during the Civil War (Lich 2009; THC Site Form).
The Sisterdale Valley District is currently represented by
15 historic buildings and six structures located throughout
the district. The buildings include wood cabins, stone build­
ings, log coach houses, barns, and several other structures
and outbuildings. Many of these buildings and structures
are presently occupied and utilized. None of the buildings,
structures, or contributing elements are located within or
immediately adjacent to the project APE.

results of survey
Route 5F is approximately 2.25 miles long, the entirety of
which was intensively surveyed for cultural resources. The
survey typically encountered shallow soils with occasional
areas of exposed bedrock, especially along the western
portion of the project area near SH 1376. The route crosses
three upland tributaries that have incised into bedrock and
do not contain any depositional soils within the project APE.
Three shovel tests were conducted along the route in the
vicinity of the three tributaries. The shovel test encountered
extremely shallow gravel deposits of eroded and weathered
limestone deposits. No cultural material was encountered
in the shovel tests and only one flake was observed on the

surface in an upland area with exposed limestone gravels
and cobbles. Additional shovel tests were not performed in
this area due to the lack of soil and high surface visibility
(ca. 85 percent). No other cultural material was observed in
the vicinity of the flake or throughout the rest of the route.
A historic building labeled as a “Community Center” on the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Sisterdale Topographical
map is located near the western terminus of Route 5F. Based
on the description available on the THC site form, the build­
ing is likely the “Upper School”, a one-story schoolhouse
built in the 1890s to serve the children in the northern part
of the district. The building is located approximately 30
m north of the Sisterdale-Lindendale Road ROW and ap­
proximately 40 m north of the project APE and will not be
impacted by the current project.
Route 3F accounts for 5.3 miles of the project area along
the SH 1376 ROW, extending from an existing telephone
utility just north of Sisterdale to just south of the intersection
of Platten Creek Road. The entire route contains shallow
soils with several areas displaying disturbances in associa­
tion with construction and maintenance of the SH 1376
roadway. These disturbances include cut and fill sections,
gravel staging areas, and parallel lined drainage features.
The entire route traverses upland hill slopes that run parallel
to West Sister Creek.
The 12 shovel tests excavated along Route 3F encountered
shallow silty clay and silt loam soils with gravels and
cobbles degrading from limestone bedrock. One isolated
chert flake was observed in an area of severe road distur­
bance. No additional cultural material was encountered
throughout the route.
Route 2F is approximately 3.8 miles long and is the southern
most route of the three Sisterdale routes. The route begins
at the intersection of SH 1376 and FM 473 and runs east,
5 feet from the southern FM 473 ROW boundary and ter­
minates at an existing utility. Soils along Route 3F were
shallow and exhibited varying degrees of roadway-related
disturbance. A total of five shovel tests was excavated along
Route 3F, all of which were located at the eastern end of
the route between Werner Creek and Jacobs Creek. Shovel
tests in this area encountered shallow gravelly clay loams
or near surface bedrock. Construction-related disturbances
such as gravel staging areas, cut and fill sections, and drain­
age features dominated the remainder of Route 3F. These
portions of Route 3F had high surface visibility and little
to no top soils, and as such were only visually inspected
for cultural resources. Accordingly, no cultural resources
were observed on the surface or within the five shovel tests
excavated along Route 5F.
The archaeological survey for routes 5F, 3F, and 2F en­
countered no archaeological sites. The low potential for
intact, significant, buried cultural deposits in the project

22

area is the result of shallow soils and the lack of preserved
alluvial deposits along drainages within the APE. All shovel
tests were negative and the visual inspection of the ground
surface encountered only two isolated chert flakes with no
additional archaeological material throughout the Sisterdale
routes. In addition, no historic buildings or structures in
association with the Sisterdale Valley District (listed on
the NRHP) will be impacted by the current undertaking.

projeCt settIng

The River Road Route 4F-12 and the Airport Road Route
4F-14 are located between the cities of Kerrville and Center
Point, Texas, off SH 27 (Figure 4.10). River Road Route
4F-12 is 2.2 miles long and begins on the east side of the
intersection of SH 27 and Sutherland Lane and runs south
along Sutherland Lane to Center Point River Road. The
route then turns west and continues along Center Point
River Road and terminates on the north side of the road
across from a private drive.
Airport Road Route 4F-14 begins at the intersection of John­
son Drive and Shady Oaks Lane, just east of the Kerrville
Municipal Airport and north of SH 27. The route follows
Johnson Drive for 0.15 mile and terminates at an existing
fiber splice box.
The routes traverse a series of upland features as well as the
Guadalupe River and a small unnamed tributary. The areas
immediately adjacent to the Guadalupe River and the small
unnamed drainage were found to contain shallow, rocky
soils that have been moderately to severely disturbed by
roadway construction and maintenance and utility instal­
lation within the ROW.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
No previous surveys or previously recorded sites are lo­
cated within or adjacent to River Road Route 4F-12, and
two surveys are located 0.21 and 0.35 mile south of Airport
Road Route 4F-14. These two surveys were conducted in
1978 and 2006 by the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
respectively. The surveys were associated with the construc­
tion of the airport and surrounding roads, and identified no
archaeological sites.

results of survey
The survey was conducted on April 29, 2009. River Road
Route 4F-12 traverses upland areas along Sutherland Lane
and Center Point River Road that contain relatively deep
upland soils. These upland soils generally have high clay
and gravel content with little alluvial deposition noted.
The portion of the route that traverses the low-lying areas
adjacent to the drainages are generally within disturbed road
cut areas and exhibit shallow soils overlying near-surface
bedrock. In all, 35 shovel tests were excavated along River
Road Route 4F-12. Soils were typically shallow, rocky clays
and shovel tests terminated at an average depth of 10 cmbs.
Only a single shovel test was excavated to 40 cmbs.
Airport Road Route 4F-14 traverses level upland areas
along Johnson Drive, just east of the Kerr County Municipal
Airport. Four shovel tests were excavated along Airport
Road Route 4F-14 and all were terminated at a depth of
5 cmbs due to the presence of near-surface bedrock. The
majority of the route has been severely impacted by road­
way construction, maintenance, and utility installation. All
four shovel tests excavated along Airport Road Route 4F-14
were negative for cultural resources.
The survey efforts along River Road Route 4F-12 and
Airport Road Route 4F-14 encountered no cultural ma­
terials on the surface or within any of the 39 shovel tests
excavated within the APE. The field survey identified thin
to non-existent soils over bedrock in the low lying areas
around drainages, and deeper soils with high clay and gravel
contents in the upland areas. Much of the APE has been
previously impacted by road construction and maintenance,
building construction, and overhead and buried utilities.
The nature of the disturbances coupled with the lack of
deeply buried, intact deposits indicates that there is a low
potential for significant cultural resources within the APE
for these routes.

within the public ROW.

Route 5F will be located within the public ROW and were
examined during the current investigation.

Route 2F-13 begins near the intersection of Eagle Drive
and SH 173, roughly 2 miles north of Ranch Road (RR)
480. The route runs along SH 173 for 2 miles, at which
point it abruptly turns west and continues onto private land.
Route 2F-13 terminates at an existing fiber splice box and
has a total length of 2.12 miles. The archaeological survey
inspected the 2 miles of the route that is located within the
public ROW.

Finally, Route 8F is located within Centerpoint, Texas and
begins north of the intersection of Stoneleigh Road and
SH 27. Route 8F travels north along Stonleigh Road and
terminates at an existing fiber splice box. The majority of
the route traverses private property, and as such, only a
0.34-mile segment of the 2.98-mile long route was surveyed
for cultural resources.

Route 2F-13.4 begins near the intersection of Verde Creek
Road and SH 173, roughly 0.18 mile north of RR 480. The
route runs along Verde Creek Road for 4.3 miles. Near
the Bandera/Kerr county line, Route 2F-13.4 crosses onto
private land and will become an overhead utility. The route
has a total length of 5.25 miles. About 4.28 miles of Route
2F-13.4 crosses private land. As such, the archaeological
survey was restricted to the 0.97-mile portion of the route
that is located within the public ROW.
Route 2F-13.9 begins at the intersection of Silver Hills Road
and SH 173, roughly 2.45 miles north of RR 480. The route
runs along Silver Hills Road and terminates at an existing
fiber splice box for a total length of 1 mile. Approximately
0.63 mile of the route will be an overhead utility, while the
remaining 0.37 mile will be buried. As such, the archaeo­
logical survey examined the 0.37-mile portion of the route
that will be installed underground.
Route 2F-18 begins about 0.46 mile west of the intersec­
tion of RR 2828 and SH 173, roughly 0.86 mile south of
the Bandera/Kerr county line. The route runs east along the
southern ROW of RR 2828 for 0.19 mile where it crosses to
the north side of the road and quickly terminates. All 0.20
mile of Route 2F-18 is located within public ROW and was
examined during the current investigation.
Route 3F begins at the intersection of RR 480 and Elm Pass
Road, roughly 0.80 mile south of the Guadalupe River in
Centerpoint, Texas. The route follows Elm Pass Road for
the entirely of its length and terminates at an existing fiber
splice box. The entire 7-mile-long route is located within
the public ROW and was examined as a part of the current
investigation.
Route 3F-21 travels east along the northern ROW of Pecan
Valley Road for 1.5 miles before terminating at an existing
fiber splice box. All 1.5 miles of Route 3F-21 is located
within public ROW and was examined by an archaeologi­

The background review for the Centerpoint routes deter­
mined that two surveys conducted on behalf of LCRA in
1995 and 2008 cross the APE of Centerpoint Routes 8F and
5F. Both surveys were associated with the replacement of
utility towers for LCRA transmission lines. Both projects
encountered numerous sites, however only one (41KR674)
is located within the APE of a Centerpoint route. In addi­
tion, a survey was conducted in 1991 along SH 173 by the
State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(SDHPT) along Route 2F-13. No other previous investiga­
tions are within or immediately adjacent to the remainder
of the project area.
Eight of the nine Centerpoint routes have at least one
previously recorded site located immediately adjacent or
within the project APE. A total of six archaeological sites
(41KR268 through 41KR272) are located between 0.5 and
0.8 mile north and east of the northern terminus of Route
2F-13. No information is available for these sites other than
their location. However, the proximity of these sites implies
they were recorded during a single project.
Site 41KR472 is located about midway along Route 2F-13
and near the western end of Route 2F-13.9, on the east side
of SH 173. Site 41KR472 is a prehistoric lithic quarry lo­
cated on a terrace of Pass Creek. This site was encountered
in 1991 during the previously mentioned survey of SH 173.
The recorders encountered chert flakes and cores extending
to approximately 20 cmbs. Due to the disturbed nature of
the site, no further investigations were recommended. Sites
41KR267 and 41KR273 are located west of the southern
end of Route 2F-13. Site 41KR267 is about 0.17 mile west
of SH 173, and site 41KR273 is 0.6 mile west of SH 173.
No other information is available for these sites.
Site 41KR473 is located approximately 40 feet north of
Route 2F-13.4, near its eastern end. The site was recorded
in 1990 by William Moore of Brazos Valley Research As­
sociates and is defined as a prehistoric campsite. Further
testing was recommended in order to determine the signifi­
cance of the site.
Approximately 0.32 mile west of site 41KR473, on the
south side of Verde Road, is the Camp Verde Community

26

Chapter 4

Cemetery (KR-C022). No other information is available
for this cemetery other than its establishment date of 1892.
The Camp Verde National Register District is located ap­
proximately 0.48 mile west of the cemetery on the north
side of Verde Road. Camp Verde is a historic military camp
established in 1855 by the U.S. Army. During the use of this
frontier post, the army briefly used camels as a system of
overland travel and communication to points further west.
The camp was surrendered to the Confederate forces early
in the Civil War and was reoccupied in 1865 during the ante­
bellum. The U.S. Army eventually abandoned Camp Verde
in 1869. The National Register District encompasses various
aspects of the history and documentation of Camp Verde
including its archaeological site designation (41KR111)
and two historic markers (640 and 4748).
Site 41BN173 is located approximately 200 feet north of
Route 2F-18. The site is situated on a south trending toe
slope of an upland ridge overlooking Bandera Creek. Re­
corded in 2001, the site is described as prehistoric burned
rock midden with a chert artifact assemblage that contains
Pedernales dart points. The recorder recommended that
41BN173 be monitored should any future impacts occur.
The Centerpoint Cemetery (KR-C021) is located near the
northern end of Route 3F, on the north side of FM 480. The
records indicate that the cemetery was established in 1859
and currently has more than 1,450 internments. Of note, at
least 32 Texas Rangers are buried here as well as numer­
ous early settlers. The oldest marked grave is that of Lydia
Burney (1795–1875).
Site 41KR211 is located approximately 0.4 mile east of
Route 3F and roughly 0.7 mile north of Route 3F-21. Re­
corded in 1983, the site is situated on a meander terrace
of Elm Creek and is characterized as an Archaic site with
burned rock middens, numerous chert debitage, chipped
stone tool fragments, and the stem of a Pedernales projectile
point. No recommendations were made on the site form
regarding the need for further work.
Site 41KR674 is located within the APE of Route 5F, mid­
way along its alignment within Centerpoint, Texas. The
site was documented during the survey of the LCRA trans­
mission line project in 2008. Site 41KR674 is bisected by
Skyline Road and is situated on a terrace of the Guadalupe
River. The site is a small prehistoric open campsite consist­
ing of chert debitage and chipped stone tools. The highest
concentration of artifacts was noted outside of the Skyline
Road ROW. No further investigations were recommended
for 41KR674 due to the sparse and generally disturbed
nature of the artifact assemblage.
Finally, at the extreme northern end of Route 8F is a his­
toric marker (5131) that recognizes the historic Stoneleigh
Ranch. The marker text indicates that the ranch was estab­

lished in 1883 by prominent Centerpoint citizen George
Leigh who grew his ranch to over 3,000 acres. The ranch
remained in the Leigh family until the 1960s.

results of survey
The Centerpoint routes largely traverse upland ridges and
slopes. When these routes do cross fluvial channels, they
are typically within smaller drainage valleys. Despite the
proximity of these routes to each other, they do cross di­
verse landscapes.

route 2f-7
The majority of Route 2F-7 traverses rocky uplands with
little to no soils. The investigations encountered deposits
that have been disturbed by roadway construction and main­
tenance along Witt Way. The soils in proximity to Spring
Creek were found to be extremely shallow and underlain by
fractured bedrock. Overall, four shovel tests were excavated
along Route 2F-7 with compact or rocky soils consistently
encountered at an average depth of 10–33 cmbs. No cultural
materials were encountered on the surface or within the four
shovel tests excavated along Route 2F-7.

route 2f-13
Route 2F-13 crosses valley floor deposits that consist of
a combination of colluvium and alluvium deposition. The
investigations encountered disturbances predominantly as­
sociated with road construction and, to a lesser extent, road
maintenance. The fill section of SH 173 encompasses all
but 8 feet of the ROW for most of the route. The shovel test
investigations encountered deposits impacted by roadway
construction, as was evidenced by the presence of heavily
mottled soils that contained road gravels. The soils adjacent
to Pass Creek were originally thought to have the greatest
potential for deep alluvial deposits. However, shovel test­
ing in this area encountered shallow loams underlain by
dense gravel lenses composed of subrounded-ovoid shaped
cobbles. In total, 16 shovel test excavations were placed
along Route 2F-13, with compact or rocky soil noted at
depths ranging from 17–30 cmbs. The area where the pre­
viously recorded site 41KR472 is located, adjacent to Pass
Creek, was also thoroughly examined. No cultural materials
associated with site 41KR472 were encountered within the
APE of Route 2F-13. Overall, the shovel tests excavated
along the route were negative for cultural material.

route 2f-13.4
A large portion of Route 2F-13.4 traverses private property,
and was not surveyed. This portion of the route includes
the area where previously recorded sites 41KR111 and
41KR473 are located. As such, sites 41KR111 and 41KR473
were not assessed during the current investigation. A total
of 10 shovel tests were excavated in the public-owned sec­

site 41kr686

route 2f-18

Site 41KR686 is a shallowly buried prehistoric campsite
located on the toeslope of a terrace overlooking Verde
Creek to the south. This site is within the public ROW of
Route 2F-13.4 immediately north of Verde Creek Road. Six
shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and
horizontal extent of cultural materials within the APE. Four
of these excavations contained buried cultural material to
a maximum depth of 100 cmbs. The main concentration of
artifacts was found to occur between 40–70 cmbs. The site
measures approximately 135 m east to west and 10 m north
to south within the public ROW. Vegetation in the site area
consists of short, mixed grasses and scattered hardwoods
(cedar elm and oaks) along the ROW fence, limiting surface
visibility to approximately 5 percent. Artifacts observed in
the positive shovel tests included approximately 17 (sec­
ondary, tertiary, and shatter) chert flakes, with one chipped
stone tool fragment (bifacial tool), and two mussel shell
fragments. No diagnostic artifacts were observed within
the site.

The survey efforts determined that Route 2F-18 has been
extensively impacted by road construction, utilities, and
fence installation. Additionally, the investigations encoun­
tered an extremely rocky ground surface with little to no
topsoil and excellent surface visibility (ca. 80–95 percent).
As such, no shovel test excavations were conducted. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface and no
locations capable of containing buried deposits within the
project alignment were present.

The observed soil in the shovel tests were noticeably dif­
ferent from that observed outside of the site along the
remainder of Route 2F-13.4. Specifically, the encountered
stratigraphy consists of clay loam with gravels overlying
loose, homogenous (well-sorted) sand. Comparatively,
the soils outside of the site on adjacent landforms are very
rocky and shallow. Within 41KR686, there is no discernable stratification within the site deposits, nor were any
intact features encountered. The site appears to have been
disturbed by the construction of Verde Creek Road as well
as ongoing ROW maintenance. The site has been severely
disturbed within the ROW, this is due primarily to its loca­
tion on a toeslope of terrace that has been cut below grade.
However, the site assuredly extends upslope outside of the
ROW where disturbance is minimal. Overall, 41KR686
is a small prehistoric open campsite that lacks contextual
integrity, diagnostic artifacts, or intact cultural features.
With this in mind, the site’s research value is low and
would contribute little to the understanding of prehistoric
occupation in the region. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41KR686.

route 2f-13.9
The investigations along Route 2F-13.9 encountered ex­
tremely rocky upland soils with abundant exposed bedrock.
Furthermore, the route APE has experienced extensive
impacts from road construction, residential development,
and various utilities installation. Overall, two shovel tests
were excavated along Route 2F-13.9 with rocky soils en­

Route 3F is the longest of the Centerpoint routes and has
a total length of 7 miles, all of which is located within
public ROW. Disturbances along Route 3F are gener­
ally related to roadway construction, maintenance, utility
installation, drainage infrastructure, residential develop­
ment and associated improvements, and erosion. Of these
disturbances, those associated with road construction are
the most pervasive, consisting of ditches and fill sections.
The surface visibility along Route 3F ranged from 40–90
percent overall. A total of 50 shovel tests were excavated
along this 7-mile route. With the exception of the shovel
tests excavated along the terraces of Verde Creek and its
tributary, all of the shovel tests had an average depth of less
than 10 cmbs. Overwhelmingly, the soils observed consisted
of a thin surface horizon of humate above silt loam with
abundant gravels overlying indurated degrading bedrock. In
contrast, the soils at the northern end of the route, along the
terraces of Verde Creek, encountered slightly darker silty
clay loams with increasing clay content and compaction
with depth. These shovel tests also commonly exhibited
some evidence of disturbance (e.g., mottling). Overall, no
intact deep deposits were observed along Route 3F that
have a high likelihood of containing significant, buried
archaeological deposits.
A single chert flake was identified on the surface in an
upland portion of the route, between Juliana Bluff and Lochin Bar Ranch Roads. The area around the chert flake was
extensively examined and a total of seven shovel tests was
placed in the immediate vicinity. The surface inspection and
shovel testing efforts failed to identify additional cultural
materials in this area and as such the find was determined
to be an isolated occurrence. Ultimately, no archaeological
resources or intact areas containing archaeological sites
were observed along Route 3F.

route 3f-21
Associated with Route 3F is the 1.5-mile long ancillary
Route 3F-21, located near the center of Route 3F along
Pecan Valley Road. The 11 shovel tests excavated along
Route 3F-21 encountered silt loam with abundant gravels
overlying indurated limestone gravels and cobbles that were
interpreted to be degrading bedrock. The majority of the
shovel tests excavated along Route 3F-21 had an average
depth of 10 cmbs. Soils along the Elm Creek drainage were
found to be somewhat deeper, extending to 40 cmbs. Elm
Creek, in this area, appears to have been modified in order to
facilitate storm water surges and high velocity floodwaters.
With this in mind, it is unlikely that any alluvial features
remain intact in this area. Overall, no cultural materials were
observed on the surface or encountered during the shovel
test excavations along Route 3F-21.

route 5f
Located within the city of Centerpoint, Texas, Route 5F
starts just northwest of the intersection of Park Avenue
and Skyline Drive. Route 5F is roughly divided between a
lowland setting and rocky uplands. Previously recorded site
41KR674 is located along Route 5F, near its western end.
The site was originally documented as a small prehistoric
lithic scatter. A series of shovel tests were placed along the
edge of the ROW within the documented site boundaries.
The shovel test excavations encountered disturbed deposits
composed primarily of road fill with no evidence of cultural
materials. A total of 10 shovel tests was excavated along
Route 5F, with soils consisting of dark brown compact
clay loams, disturbed road fill, or rocky soil ranging in
depth from 10–50 cmbs. All shovel tests excavated along
the route were negative for cultural material. No evidence
of the previously recorded site 41KR674 was encountered
within the APE of Route 5F.

route 8f
Route 8F is located north of Centerpoint, Texas, about 0.25
mile north of SH 27 on Stoneleigh Road. The APE, in this
area, was found to be extremely narrow with disturbances
consisting of fence lines, buried utilities, and the construc­
tion of Stoneleigh Road. Due to the high surface visibility
and the very narrow disturbed ROW, only one shovel test
excavation was conducted on this route. This shovel test
encountered disturbed road fill with clay loam extending to
a maximum depth of 35 cmbs. No cultural materials were
encountered either on the surface or within the single shovel
test excavated along Route 8F.
Sites 41KR674 and 41KR472 were revisited during the
current investigation. Site 41KR674 is located adjacent to
Route 5F and site 41KR472 is located directly adjacent to
Route 2F-13. Shovel testing efforts and surface inspection
within the previously documented boundaries of these sites

failed to identify any cultural materials within the APE. It is
likely that roadway construction and utility installation has
severely impacted these sites. All other previously recorded
sites noted adjacent to or within the Centerpoint routes are
located on private property and were not investigated during
the current survey effort.

projeCt settIng

The Comfort South routes (i.e., 2F-1, 2F-3, 2F-3L, 2F-8, 6F,
6F-40, and 9F-15) are located around the city of Comfort,
Texas, and are west of IH 10 (Figure 4.12). Route 2F-1 be­
gins on the southeast side of the intersection of High Street
and River Oaks Road. The route immediately crosses River
Oaks Road to the north and parallels River Oaks Road for
approximately 0.2 mile. The ROW then moves north out of
the existing ROW onto private property. The route continues
west on private property for the remainder of its length.
Route 2F-3 begins on the northeast side of the intersection of
High Street and Holiday Road. The route parallels Holiday
Road along the east side of the ROW for approximately
2.6 miles and terminates at an existing fiber splice box just
north of an ephemeral drainage. The archaeological survey
inspected the entire 2.7 miles of Route 2F-3, as it is located
entirely within the public ROW.
Route 2F-3L begins at the same point as Route 2F-3, on
the northeast side of the intersection of High Street and
Holiday Road. The route runs north along Holiday Road for
approximately 0.1 mile and turns northeast and to follow
FM 289. The route terminates at an existing substation and
has a total length of 0.49 mile. The entire length of Route
2F-3L was surveyed for cultural resources.
Route 2F-8 begins on the southeastern side of the intersec­
tion of FM 289 and Big Joshua Creek Road. The route runs
south along Big Joshua Creek Road to the intersection of
Big Joshua Creek Road, Below Road, and Possum Creek
Road. Here the route turns west and parallels Below Road
and Holiday Road before turning west and terminating on
private property. The archaeological survey inspected the
entire 4.7 miles of the route.
Route 6F begins at the intersection of Pankratz Road and
Mill Dam Road. The route travels south along Mill Dam
Road, where it snakes in and out of the public ROW. The
route eventually terminates near the Kendall/Kerr county
line and has a total length of 5 miles. In all, the archaeologi­
cal survey inspected 1.26 miles of Route 6F.

Chapter 4

Situated near the center of Route 6F is Route 6F-40. Route
6F-40 begins on the Kendall/Kerr county line, just west of
the intersection of Linder Branch Road and Mill Dam Road.
The route parallels Linder Brand Road and turns north and
follows the eastern ROW of Hermann Sons Road. The route
terminates at an existing fiber splice box and has a total
length of 1.5 miles. The archaeological survey inspected
the entire length of Route 6F-40.
Finally, Route 9F-15 is located northwest of Comfort, Texas
and beings just west of the intersection of Stoneleigh Road
and Lazy Valley Road. The route travels westward along
Lazy Valley Road, where it snakes in and out of the public
ROW. The route terminates at an existing fiber splice box
just east of a small ephemeral drainage. The archaeological
survey inspected 1.5 miles of Route 9F-15.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
While several surveys have been conducted in the vicinity
of the various Comfort South routes, only one of these is
within the APE of the proposed routes. A survey of the Ken­
dall to Cagnon transmission line for LCRA was conducted
by SWCA in 2005. This line crosses Route 2F-8 roughly
1 mile west of FM 289. A number of sites were recorded
during this 2005 survey, including three within 1 mile of
the Comfort South routes. However, no sites were recorded
within any of the route ROWs.
No previously recorded sites have been documented within
or directly adjacent to the APE of the Comfort South routes.
A total of 12 archaeological sites (41KE79, 41KE83,
41KE166, 41KE172, 41KE173, 41KE174, 41KR21,
41KR114, 41KR115, 41KR116, 41KR117, and 41KR576)
have been recorded within 1 mile of the routes and two
historical markers are located within 1 mile of Route 9F-15.

results of survey
The Comfort South routes largely traverse upland ridges
and slopes. When these routes do cross fluvial channels,
they are typically within smaller drainage valleys. Despite
the proximity of these routes to each other, they do cross
diverse landscapes. Overall, SWCA excavated a total of 47
shovel tests along the Comfort South routes.

route 2f-1
Route 2F-1 traverses the rocky upland areas above the Gua­
dalupe River to the north. The APE of Route 2F-1 exhibits
signs of extensive erosion within the narrow ROW, with
exposed bedrock present in multiple areas. The APE has also
been subject to typical ROW construction and maintenance
activities. One shovel test was excavated along Route 2F-1.
The test encountered 25 cm of silty clay atop brown basal
clay, and was negative for cultural material.

route 2f-3
Route 2F-3 traverses rocky uplands and lower undulating
terrain of a wide valley floor as it moves toward Holiday
Creek. The ROW along Route 2F-3 is very narrow and
shows signs of extensive erosion, with limestone bedrock
exposed in many areas. Surface visibility within the APE
ranges from 0–75 percent. A total of seven shovel tests was
excavated along the Route 2F-3, all of which encountered
gravelly silty clay and clay atop bedrock. All shovel tests
along Route 2F-3 were negative for cultural material.

route 2f-3l
Route 2F-3L travels north along Holiday Road, and then
turns east along FM 289 and ends at an existing HCTC
substation on the southwest side of the road. The APE has
been heavily disturbed by a drainage ditching along FM
289 and by the installation of multiple underground utili­
ties along Holiday Road. One shovel test was excavated
along the route, near a drainage on the southwest side of
FM 289. The test encountered dense clay with gravels, and
was terminated at 30 cmbs upon encountering basal clay.
No cultural materials were encountered along Route 2F-3L.

route 2f-8
Route 2F-8 travels through the undulating terraces and
uplands north of Big Joshua Creek along Big Joshua Creek
Road. The entire length of the alignment is located within
the public ROW. Surface visibility within the ROW of Route
2F-8 ranged from 5–95 percent with disturbances consisting
of road and ROW construction and maintenance, overhead
utility installation, a previously excavated borrow pit, and
erosion. Sites 41KE212 and 41KE213 were documented
within the ROW of Route 2F-8 as a result of the current
investigation.

site 41ke212
Site 41KE212 is a small prehistoric lithic scatter located
along the western ROW of Holiday Road in the southern
portion of Route 2F-8 (Figure 4.13). The site lies between
a small ephemeral drainage to the south and a rocky upland
slope to the north. The site measures approximately 15 m
in diameter and was initially identified when five chert
flake fragments were recovered from 70–100 cmbs. Four
additional shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity, all
of which were negative for cultural material.
Additional shovel tests within the site area encountered thin,
rocky clay loam above silty clay with gravel inclusions. In
some areas, the silty clay extended to depths beyond 100
cmbs, while in others, limestone bedrock was encountered
at 15–75 cmbs. Soils were found to be the shallowest near
the rocky upland slope. It is currently unclear what may
have caused the artifact assemblage to be so localized with

Survey Results for Zone 1 31
the east ROW is not part of the APE. The western ROW
of Holiday Road has been extensively impacted by ero­
sion, underground utilities, land modifications, and road
and ROW construction and maintenance activities. A large
borrow pit is located along the northern border of the site,
and has likely disturbed a portion of the site. Additionally,
crudely excavated pits in the ROW and the grouping of the
surface artifacts suggest that the majority of the artifacts
were placed in their current location (i.e. small pile) by
looters rather than as a result of prehistoric deposition.

Figure 4.13. Overview of site 41KE212, facing south.

no additional cultural materials encountered on the surface
or within adjacent shovel tests. The deposition of this small
collection of non-diagnostic artifacts within a single shovel
test may be attributed to natural factors such as storm water
surges or sheetwash from the adjacent upland.
Presently, no intact features or diagnostic artifacts were
found to be associated with the artifact assemblage. The
deposits have been impacted by erosion, bioturbation, and
road and ROW construction and maintenance. Overall, the
site has a low probability of containing additional or sig­
nificant, intact, archaeological deposits within the Holiday
Road ROW, and its research potential is low. The site is not
recommended for formal designation as an SAL.

site 41ke213
Site 41KE213 is a surficial artifact scatter located along
the Holiday Road ROW in the southern portion of Route
2F-8. The site lies approximately 4.1 miles south of the
intersection of Big Joshua Creek Road and FM 289, and
approximately 300 m north of site 41KE212. The site lies
on a gently sloping to level area on the east face of a hillslope, approximately 300 m west of Big Joshua Creek. Site
41KE213 measures 40 m north-south by 30 m east-west,
and is bisected by Holiday Road. The site was identified
during a surface survey of the ROW when a pile of artifacts,
including nine bifacial tool fragments and two chert flakes,
was observed near the west side of the road. A subsequent
intensive surface survey of the area identified 10 additional
chert flakes and a bifacial tool fragment. A surface inspec­
tion on the east side of the road produced approximately
five chert flakes. Six shovel tests were excavated within
the site on the west side of the road, all of which were
negative for cultural material. The site delineation shovel
tests encountered gravelly silty clay ranging in depth from
5–75 cm in thickness, overlying limestone bedrock. No
shovel tests were excavated on the east side of the road as

No intact features or diagnostic artifacts were recorded on
site 41KE213. The cultural materials occur on the surface
of the site, with no evidence of subsurface deposition.
The deposits have been subjected to the effects of erosion,
bioturbation, and road and ROW construction and mainte­
nance, leaving the site deflated and disturbed. Furthermore,
many of the observed artifacts were in a disturbed context,
with their present position likely a result of looting activi­
ties. Overall, the site has a low probability of containing
significant, intact, archaeological deposits within the Holi­
day Road ROW, and its research potential is low. The site
is not recommended for formal designation as an SAL.

route 6f
Route 6F begins at the intersection of Mill Dam Road
and Pankratz Road, just southwest of Comfort, Texas, in
Kendall County. The route travels south along Mill Dam
Road and will be an overhead utility for the majority of
its 5-mile length. A total of 1.26 miles of the route will be
underground and within the existing ROW. The existing
ROW is very narrow and heavily disturbed by erosion and
ROW construction and maintenance activities. In some
areas along the route, the ROW is cut below grade. Three
shovel tests were excavated in the APE along Route 6F.
Each test encountered a thin lens of rocky silty clay atop
bedrock. All shovel tests were negative for cultural material.

route 6f-40
Route 6F-40 begins at the intersection of Mill Dam Road
and Linder Branch Road, roughly 4.2 miles southwest of
Comfort, on the Kendall/Kerr county line. The entire route
is within the public ROW. Eight shovel tests were conducted
within the eastern portion of the route, where it closely
parallels Bruins Creek. Shovel tests targeted the terrace
floodplain deposits of the creek, but encountered shallow to
moderately deep clay and clay loam with gravel overlying
limestone bedrock. None of the shovel tests excavated along
Route 6F-40 were positive for cultural material.
As the route moves north away from Bruins Creek along
Hermann Sons Road, it traverses hilly, eroded rocky up­
lands. Surface visibility in this portion of the route was
high (ca. 75–95 percent), and soils were extremely shallow

to non-existent. The ROW, in this area, has been heavily
disturbed by erosion, ROW construction and maintenance
activities, and road cuts. As such, only a surface survey
was conducted along this portion of the APE, with no
shovel tests excavated. Overall, no cultural materials were
encountered during the survey of Route 6F-40.

route 9f-15
Route 9F-15 travels west along Lazy Valley Road, and is
located outside the ROW on private property for approxi­
mately 1 mile of its 2.5 mile length. The 1.5 miles of ROW
that were surveyed are dominated by rocky uplands with
shallow soils. Surface visibility along the route ranged
from 0–98 percent, and averaged 30 percent. A total of
eight shovel tests was excavated within the APE, all of
which encountered clay loam and sandy clay loam with
gravel overlying bedrock. All shovel tests were negative
for cultural material.

Medina north routes (1f, 2f, 3f, 3f-36,

Miles surveyed: 20.35 miles
county: Bandera County
number of new sites found: 5
number of sites revisited: 2

projeCt settIng

The Medina North routes (1F, 2F, 3F, 3F-36, and 4F-4) total
25.17 miles and are located in the northern part of Bandera
County, around the small town of Medina, Texas (Figure
4.14). The routes are located within the public ROWs along
FM 2107, SH 16, Ranch-to-Market (RM) 337, and short
stretches along Carpenter Creek Road, Patterson Avenue,
and Moffit Road.
Route 1F runs along FM 2107, and within the 8.9-mile
stretch, the line switches to aerial routes and/or exits the
public ROW onto private property several times.
Route 2F parallels SH 16 and runs to the north for 4.6
miles. Approximately 0.75 mile of Route 2F crosses onto
private property near its northern terminus. The remaining
stretch of Route 2F is located on private property and was
not surveyed for cultural resources.
Route 3F begins at the intersection of SH 16 and RM 337
and parallels the north side of RM 337 for approximately 4
miles before crossing to the south side of the roadway for the
remaining 6 miles. The proposed alignment is largely within
the public ROW but crosses onto private property and/or
switches to an overhead route for several short stretches
within the 10-mile route. Near the western terminus of
Route 3F, and beginning approximately 0.33 mile south of
RM 337, Route 3F-36 parallels Carpenter Creek Road from

north to south for 0.48 mile. The final segment surveyed
was Route 4F-4, which is located south of downtown Me­
dina along Patterson and Moffit roads. Approximately 8.85
miles of Route 3F are located in the public ROW and were
surveyed for cultural resources.
The Medina North routes are all located in close proximity
to the North and West prongs of the Medina River or one of
its tributary creeks. Surface visibility was typically greater
than 30 percent over the majority of the project area. The
field survey often encountered shallow soils and frequent
outcrops of bedrock. No Holocene deposits are mapped
within the project area and observed soil depths seldom
exceeded 50–60 cmbs. In isolated locations where soils
would potentially permit deeper excavation, the depth of
impact from the proposed construction is less than the depth
able to be reached through hand excavation. Based on these
observations, backhoe trenching was not necessary.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
According to available data, the TDHPT and the FHWA
conducted archaeological investigations throughout the
Route 3F alignment along RM 337 in 1975 and 1992. One
site (41BN5) was recorded within the current project area
as a result of the 1975 survey. No other surveys have been
conducted within the various Medina North routes.
The only other archaeological survey recorded within a
1-mile radius of the project area was conducted over an
approximately 105-acre area located 0.75 mile northeast
of Route 2F by Cojeen Archeological Services in 2003. No
sites were recorded within a 1-mile radius of the Medina
routes as a result of this survey.
Two previously recorded sites are located within the project
area, one along Route 1F (41BN202) and the other within
Route 3F (41BN5). In addition to these two sites, 31 pre­
historic and multi-component sites are located within 1 mile
of the proposed routes. Twenty-five of these sites were re­
corded during private thesis fieldwork by Sue Amini-Minor
in 1978, and are all between 50 m and 1,300 m northeast
of Route 2F. (Due to the close proximity of these sites it is
likely that they are components of a few large sites rather
than individual, discrete occupations.)
Site 41BN5 is a prehistoric campsite recorded in 1975 by
Milton Bell on behalf of the TDHPT prior to construction of
FM 1366 (now RM 337). The site consists of lithic debitage,
burned rock, and small cores located on a bluff overlook­
ing the West Prong Medina River to the south. The site is
confined to a 100-foot radius that falls mostly within the
proposed highway ROW. A surface collection was made
along with test pit excavations and no further work was
recommended for the site (TARL Site File).

Chapter 4

Site 41BN202 was recorded in 2006 by THC Regional
Archaeologist Dan Potter after archaeological materials
were discovered by the landowner while planting trees near
the end of his driveway at FM 2107. The site is located at
the toe of a southward sloping upland overlooking a sig­
nificant bend in the North Prong Medina River. Artifacts
include lithic debitage, burned rock, and Early Triangular
and Gower dartpoints. No formal subsurface tests were
excavated, but deposits were indicated to 20 cmbs by the
landowner. The site was recommended as eligible for SAL
and NRHP listing.
The 31 sites within the 1-mile search radius consist of 26
lithic scatters (41BN34, 41BN35, 41BN36, 41BN37, and
41BN38, 41BN39, 41BN40, 41BN41, 41BN42, 41BN43,

41BN56, 41BN57, 41BN58, and 41NB195) and five open
campsites (41BN93, 41BN189, 41BN197, 41BN199, and
41BN200).

results of survey
route 1f
Route 1F parallels FM 2017, which generally runs alongside
the North Prong Medina River from SH 16 to the east, into
the steep uplands of the west. Overall, ground surface vis­
ibility was between 30 and 60 percent within the Route 1F
APE. The majority of the route has shallow soils that are
very often gravelly at the surface. Some areas have exposed
limestone bedrock at the surface. A total of 95 shovel tests
was excavated along the approximately 6.75 miles of Route
1F located within the public ROW. The maximum shovel
test depth reached throughout Route 1F was 45 cmbs, with
an average sediment depth of approximately 15 cmbs.
Most shovel tests were terminated due to the presence of
extremely dense and gravelly clay.
Three of the 95 shovel tests were positive for cultural mate­
rial resulting in the identification of one new archaeological
site (41BN215), which is located near the northwest route
terminus. Approximately 0.62 mile southeast of 41BN215,
archaeologists revisited site 41BN202 and noted a few
non-diagnostic artifacts on the ground surface. No other
historic or prehistoric cultural resources were encountered
throughout the remainder of Route 1F.
Disturbance within the ROW consisted of paved and gravel
driveways, existing utilities, drainage crossings and cul­
verts, and general highway construction and maintenance
activity. Modern trash was scattered across the entire APE.

site 41bn215
Site 41BN215 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on a high
terrace on the north side of the Medina River within the

public ROW immediately southwest of FM 2107. A total
of six shovel tests was used to delineate the site boundaries
within the APE, three of which had buried cultural material
to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. The main concentration of
artifacts was found to occur between 15 and 30 cmbs. The
site measures approximately 60 m northwest to southeast
within the public ROW. Vegetation in the site area consists
of short, maintained grasses and a few scattered shrubs
along the ROW fence, limiting surface visibility to approxi­
mately 10 percent. Artifacts observed in the positive shovel
tests included approximately 14 tertiary and secondary chert
flakes, with one flake observed on the surface. No diagnostic
artifacts were observed within the site. At depths beyond
30 cmbs, the silt loam soil becomes lighter in color with
significant gravel and calcium carbonate concentrations.
No artifacts were observed beneath this soil change. There
is no discernable stratification within the deposit, nor were
any intact features encountered.
The site has likely been disturbed by the construction of
FM 2107 and ROW maintenance. Site 41BN215 likely
represents a small prehistoric open campsite, and due to the
high level of disturbance within the APE it exhibits little
potential for significant deposits and features that could
contribute to the archaeological understanding of prehistoric
occupation in the region. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41BN215.

41bn202
Site 41BN202 was originally identified in 2006 as a buried
prehistoric terrace occupation site located approximately
8.1 miles west of the town of Medina in Bandera County,
Texas. The site was encountered within the public ROW on
the southwest side of FM 2107 and extends approximately
200 m northwest to southeast. Three shovel tests were exca­
vated at 100-m intervals due to the shallow nature of soils,
and all were negative for buried cultural material. The site
is situated on a high, rocky terrace approximately 100 m
northeast of the North Prong Medina River. Vegetation is
sparse, consisting of short, patchy grass and a line of cedar
trees parallel to the roadway. Soils within the site consist of
shallow, gravely silt loam with exposed bedrock and gravels
visible in the area. Artifacts observed on the surface within
the site area include five tertiary and five secondary chert
flakes. In addition to these prehistoric artifacts, a significant
amount of modern dumping has occurred within the site
area. Trash including a barbeque smoker, washing machine
parts, automobile tire rim, bailing wire, and plastic and glass
bottles are all present within the APE.
Most of the artifacts were observed immediately adjacent
to the roadway, with only a couple of pieces of debitage
spilling off of the hillside into the current APE. At the
time the site was originally recorded, Potter (TARL site
file) deemed the site of high research value and noted that

Survey Results for Zone 1 35
due to the terrace setting of the site, there was a high prob­
ability of intact cultural features existing within the site
boundaries. The site was recommended for testing by the
THC. However, the portion of site 41BN202 that extends
into the current project area exhibits little to no potential for
significant deposits and features that could contribute to the
archaeological understanding of prehistoric occupation in
the region. Accordingly, no further work is recommended
in the HCTC APE at site 41BN202.

route 2f
Route 2F runs for 4.6 miles from south to north along SH
16, beginning at the intersection of SH 16 and FM 2107.
Aside from an approximately 0.5-mile segment near Wal­
lace Creek, the entire Route 2F APE is located on the east
side of SH 16. Approximately 1.3 miles of the proposed
route is located on private property, northeast of Wallace
Creek, before it reenters the public ROW for a short segment
and exits again for the remainder of the route.
A total of 47 shovel tests was excavated along the 3.66 miles
of Route 2F located within the public ROW, all of which
were negative for cultural material. Typical upland soils
were encountered throughout the majority of the project
area, consisting of gravelly clay loam that becomes highly
calcareous just below the surface. Shovel tests along Route
2F were terminated at an average depth of 15 cmbs due to
ancient soil, characterized by extremely compact clay with
an abundance of developed calcium carbonate. Vegetation
within the APE consists of short grass that is often very thin
due to a lack of soil, exposing dense gravels and portions
of limestone bedrock. Average surface visibility is approxi­
mately 50 percent. Disturbance within the APE consists of
an existing, buried HCTC communications line, residential
driveways, drainage crossings, and culverts. No prehistoric
or historic cultural materials were found along Route 2F.

route 3f
Route 3F is the longest of the Medina North routes, ex­
tending approximately 10 miles along RM 337 between
SH 16 in the town of Medina to Jackson Creek Road. The
route generally follows the West Prong Medina River and
at times comes within a few meters of the terrace edge.
Small segments of the alignment, totaling 1.15 miles, cross
beyond the limits of the public ROW and were not subject
to archaeological survey.
A total of 97 shovel tests was excavated within the 8.85
miles of Route 3F located within the public ROW. Of these,
13 shovel tests were positive for cultural material resulting
in the identification of four new prehistoric archaeological
sites (41BN216, 41BN217, 41BN218, and 41BN219).
Site 41BN5 was also relocated based on the presence of
prehistoric cultural materials observed in subsurface con­

texts. In addition to these five sites, four isolated finds (IF)
consisting of single chert flakes were recorded (IF1–IF4).
Further inspection in and around the isolated finds failed
to recover additional materials and the localities were not
considered archaeological sites.
In general, the APE of Route 3F exhibited very shallow soils
and little potential for deep site burial. Shovel tests along
Route 3F were terminated at an average depth of 14 cmbs.
Exposed bedrock and expanses of shallow and gravelly silty
clay were common, with deeper soil accumulation near the
various creek crossings. The survey targeted creek margins
and areas with lower surface visibility. Disturbance was
noted within the project area due to existing buried utilities,
highway construction and maintenance, drainage ditches,
and general erosion which has deflated the soil. Portions of
Route 3F are cut into the steep upland hillslopes, leaving
the current ground surface well below the original surface
and into bedrock. These areas were not tested.

site 41bn216
Site 41BN216 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located in the
rolling uplands on the east side of Bauerlein Creek in the
public ROW. Two shovel tests were used to delineate the site
boundaries within the APE, both of which contained buried
cultural material to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs with the
main concentration of artifacts occurring from the surface
to 15 cmbs. The site measures approximately 100 m east
to west within the public ROW. Artifacts observed in the
two positive shovel tests included approximately 110–120
chert flakes. The soil encountered in the test furthest from
Bauerlein Creek was loose and mainly consisted of gravels
and over 100 pieces of lithic debitage from 0–15 cmbs.
At 15 cmbs, the soil changes abruptly to blocky, sticky
clay. Approximately five artifacts were found from 15–20
cmbs, beneath which no cultural material was observed.
Shove Test (ST) D63 was excavated near the edge of the
level upland where soil consisted of sticky, blocky clay
that contained five chert flakes in the upper 5 cmbs. This
test was terminated at 30 cmbs due to sterile, basal clay.
Surface flakes were also observed in the vicinity of ST
D63. Due to the shallow soil, excellent surface visibility,
and surficial nature of the site, additional shovel testing
was not necessary to define the horizontal or vertical site
limits. Between ST D63 and Bauerlein Creek, the ROW
slopes steeply toward the drainage, with limestone gravels
and cobbles on the surface. No artifacts were observed on
this slope. Shovel tests on the west side of Bauerlein Creek
(STs D64 and D65) were negative for cultural material. ST
D61 was located upslope to the east of positive ST D62
and was negative for cultural material, defining the eastern
edge of the site.

Chapter 4

Based on the density of primary and secondary chert flakes
present, site 41BN216 likely represents a prehistoric open
campsite where core reduction activity occurred. There
was no discernable stratification within the deposit and no
diagnostic artifacts or intact features were observed. The
site has also been disturbed by the construction of RM 337
and ROW maintenance. Due to soil deflation and the high
level of disturbance within the APE that has likely mixed
deposits both spatially and temporally, the site presents
little potential for significant intact deposits and features
that could contribute to the archaeological understanding
of prehistoric occupation in the region. Accordingly, no
further work is recommended within the HCTC APE at
site 41BN216.

site 41bn217
Site 41BN217 is a prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located
on a small, rocky upland hilltop in the northern public
ROW along RM 337. A pedestrian surface inspection was
used to delineate the site boundaries within the APE. The
site measures approximately 35 m east to west within the
public ROW. Vegetation within the site consists of sparse
short grasses, affording approximately 75 percent surface
visibility. Shovel tests were not utilized in the site delinea­
tion due to the deflated nature of soils in the area. How­
ever, one shovel test was excavated approximately 20 m
down slope from the site, to the west, in an area where soil
was present. This test was negative for cultural material.
Artifacts observed on the surface included approximately
20–30 tertiary and secondary chert flakes and one possible
chert core.
There was no discernable patterning or deposition within
the site and no diagnostic artifacts or intact features were
encountered. The site has also been disturbed by the con­
struction of RM 337 and ROW maintenance. Site 41BN217
likely represents a short term activity area, and due to the
high level of disturbance within the APE and the deflated
hilltop setting, it exhibits little potential for significant
intact deposits and features that could contribute to the
archaeological understanding of prehistoric occupation in
the region. Accordingly, no further work is recommended
in the HCTC APE at site 41BN217.

A total of five shovel tests was excavated at 15-m intervals
to delineate the site boundaries within the APE along with
one additional shovel test on the opposite bank of Rhyme
Creek. Of these, three contained buried cultural material
to a maximum depth of 40 cmbs. The main concentration
of lithic artifacts was noted from 20–40 cmbs with a dense
lens of burned rock observed at 15–30 cmbs in ST M59.
Lithic artifacts observed in the positive shovel tests included
66 tertiary and secondary chert flakes found to a depth of
40 cmbs and one distal projectile point fragment found at
20–40 cmbs in ST M60. A non-diagnostic bifacial tool was
observed on the surface, just across the ROW fence line on
private property to the north. STs M61 and M62 were both
negative to the east, moving away from the creek. These
tests encountered gravely, compact and deflated soil near
the top of the upland formation.
The site likely extends beyond the public ROW to the north
along Rhyme Creek and may contain substantial intact cul­
tural deposits in these areas. Within the ROW the site has
likely been disturbed by the construction and maintenance
of RM 337 including a drainage ditch which parallels the
edge of the roadway. Site 41BN218 likely represents an
open campsite with a potentially intact burned rock feature
closely associated with a concentrated deposit of lithic arti­
facts. The buried nature of the site, which produced a high
number of artifacts within a discrete stratigraphic deposit,
indicates that the likelihood of encountering additional
buried features or diagnostic artifacts within the HCTC
APE is high. Accordingly, 41BN218 has the potential for
significant deposits that could contribute to the archaeologi­
cal understanding of prehistoric occupation in the region.
Due to the limited scope of the current investigations, no
determination regarding the site’s SAL and NRHP eligi­
bility can be made at this time. Further testing efforts are
recommended.

site 41bn218
Site 41BN218 is a prehistoric burned rock and lithic scatter
located on the east bank of Rhyme Creek in the northern
public ROW along RM 337 (Figures 4.15 and 4.16). The site
measures approximately 45 m east to west within the public
ROW. Within the site, soils consist of very dark grayishbrown sandy clay above sterile, brown and very compact
sandy clay with calcium carbonate inclusions. Vegetation
in the site area consists of short, maintained grasses, with
scattered shrubs and live oaks along the ROW fence line.

towards Rhyme Creek.

Figure 4.16. Map of site 41BN218.

site 41bn219
Site 41BN219 is a prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located
on a small rocky upland formation in the northern public
ROW along RM 337. Surface inspection and one shovel test
was used to delineate the site boundaries within the current
project’s APE. Due to the deflated nature of the site and lack
of soil in the hilltop area, additional shovel testing was not
necessary. Vegetation currently within the site consists of
sparse short grasses, affording approximately 80 percent
surface visibility. The site measures approximately 15 m
east to west within the public ROW. Artifacts observed on
the surface included approximately five chert flakes.
There was no discernable patterning or deposition within
the site and no diagnostic artifacts or intact features were
encountered. The site had been disturbed by the construction
of RM 337 and ROW maintenance. The upland landform
was cut immediately adjacent to the site during the con­
struction of RM 337. Additionally, much of the area to the
northeast of the ROW has been cleared and modified for rec­
reational use. Site 41BN219 likely represents a short-term
activity area, and due to the high level of disturbance within
the APE and the deflated hill top setting, it exhibits little

to no potential for significant intact deposits and features
that could contribute to the archaeological understanding of
prehistoric occupation in the region. Accordingly, no further
work is recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41BN219.

site 41bn5
Site 41BN5 was originally identified in 1975 as a surficial
and buried prehistoric site located approximately 9 miles
west of the town of Medina. Most of the subsurface cultural
material occurred within the plow zone of a large field
where the site is located. The site was revisited during the
current project on August 12, 2009, at which time seven
shovel tests were excavated within the southern public
ROW of RM 337. Within the public ROW, the site extends
approximately 120 m east to west. The site lies on a high,
rocky terrace approximately 45 m north of the West Prong
Medina River. Vegetation in the area of site 41BN5 includes
short prairie grasses with scattered oak and mesquite trees
beyond the ROW fence line. Soils within the site consist
of compact silty clay loam and sandy clay with abundant
limestone gravels and concentrations of calcium carbonate
beginning at a depth of approximately 8 cmbs.

38

Chapter 4

Of the seven shovel tests excavated across the site, only
one was negative for cultural material. Artifacts observed
in the positive shovel tests included 12 tertiary and sec­
ondary chert flakes, one of which exhibited evidence of
burning. With the exception of one burned flake that was
found at 30–35 cmbs in ST D59, almost all of the artifacts
were contained within the upper 5 cm of soil. One piece of
burned limestone was also encountered in the upper 5 cm
of sediment in ST D60. Due to sharp changes in elevation,
the site is confined to natural boundaries on the east and
west. The roadway has been cut into the landform to the
north of the APE destroying any portion of the site that may
have been present. However, it is likely that the site extends
beyond the public ROW to the south (15 m) to the edge
of the terrace. The site may also extend to the north on the
opposite side of RM 337 but this area was not investigated
during the current project.
At the time of recording, 41BN5 was considered of low
research value and no further work was recommended.
Currently, the portion of the site within the ROW has been
heavily disturbed by the construction of RM 337 and the
ROW maintenance. This portion of the site exhibits little
potential for significant deposits and features that could
contribute to the archaeological understanding of prehistoric
occupation in the region. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41BN5.

route 3f-36
Route 3F-36 runs perpendicular to Route 3F along Carpen­
ter Creek Road, beginning approximately 0.3 mile south
of RM 337. It begins within the east ROW of Carpenter
Creek Road just south of the West Prong Medina River
and continues to the south along the same side of the road
for approximately 0.48 mile before terminating where the
paved roadway ends.
A total of eight shovel tests was excavated, none of which
contained cultural material. No waterways cross along this
route, which generally gains elevation from north to south.
Topography along the short route is rocky and undulating
with very little soil. Ground visibility is approximately 70
percent across a surface covered in limestone gravels and
cobbles. One low spot along the northern half of the APE
was covered in medium-length grass with live oak trees. ST
D20 was excavated in this area, revealing 50 cm of gravelly
colluvial soil. The remainder of the shovel tests along Route
3F-36 had typically been terminated at bedrock at an aver­
age depth of 12 cmbs, below very dark grayish-brown to
pale brown silty clay loam with a high gravel content. No
previously recorded sites were present within the proposed
project area and no new sites were recorded along Route
3F-36 as a result of the current investigation.

route 4f-4
Route 4F-4 is located along Patterson Road, which makes
a 90 degree turn into Moffit Road immediately south of the
town of Medina. At the 90 degree bend, the APE crosses
onto private property for approximately 0.25 mile before
reentering the public ROW on the north side of Moffitt Road
for an additional 0.4 mile. The remainder of the APE is
routed within private property that was not subject to survey.
A total of two shovel tests was excavated on Route 4F-4,
and both were negative for cultural material. In general,
the APE is on the flat terrace south of the Medina River
at the base of the uplands. Vegetation consisted mainly
of medium length grass, with occasional pecan and cedar
trees present particularly at the southeast end of the proj­
ect area. Surface visibility was approximately 50 percent.
The ROW along Patterson Road is extremely narrow and
completely covered by road base from fence to fence. The
ROW widens out briefly where the APE crosses back onto
public property, at which point ST T63 was excavated.
Soils consisted of grayish-brown to pale gray silty loam
with heavy road gravels. ST T63 was terminated at 10 cmbs
due to extremely compact soil. The ROW again becomes
very narrow between the edge of the roadway and the fence
line, between which is located an existing buried cable. ST
T62 was excavated in the only other portion of the public
ROW that was not disturbed. This test was also terminated
at 10 cmbs, after excavating into a very compact pale brown
silty loam. The remainder of the ROW through which the
proposed line is routed is very narrow and severely eroded.
No previously recorded sites were located within the APE
and no cultural material or historical features were recorded
along Route 4F-4 as a result of the current investigation.

survey results for zone 2

zone 2

1F-12 runs south along Old Mason Road before turning
west on Pecan Creek Road and continues for 7.85 miles.

Zone 2 is spread across Gillespie, Mason, Menard, and San
Saba counties and is composed of four separate project areas
(Table 5.1, Figure 5.1). These project areas consist of the
Doss South routes, Doss West routes, Streeter West routes,
and the Katemcy, Fredonia, and Pontotoc routes. Of the 95
miles of proposed telecommunications cables within Zone
2, a total of 74.1 miles were surveyed for cultural resources.
As with Zone 1, the intensive surveys encountered similar
topographic and geomorphic settings across the routes,
generally thin soils across rocky uplands with moderate
to severe disturbances in the project corridors (Figures
5.2–5.5). These conditions, as well as the narrow ROWs
along the rural roads which the routes follow, precluded the
need for intensive shovel testing along many routes. Survey
efforts resulted in the documentation of 12 new archaeo­
logical sites and the revisit of one previously recorded site.
The results of each of these field projects are detailed in
individually submitted interim reports, however a synopsis
of each investigation is presented here (see Appendix A).

Route 1F-12-19 runs north along Nixon Creek Road for
0.83 mile from its intersection with Pecan Creek Road,
approximately 5.5 miles west of U.S. 87. Route 5F-26 runs
along the 2 miles of Cut-Off Road between Maner Road and
Doss Springs Creek Road, north-northwest of Doss Springs
Creek Road’s intersection with U.S. 290.
Route 5F-38A-1 is along the approximately 2.5 miles of Old
Harper Road between Maner Road and Doss Springs Creek
Road, south and parallel with Cut-Off Road and Route 5F­
26. Route 5F-38A-2 runs south along Doss Springs Creek
Road from the eastern extent of Route 5F-38A-1 to U.S.
290. The route continues east on U.S. 290 to Dinosaur
Ranch Road and runs south to near its intersection with
Skyline Road for a total route distance of 3.84 miles. Route
4F runs exclusively along RR 783 for 3.56 miles from its
intersection with Doss Springs Creek Road west to just
east of Bee Cave Road. The Red Bluff Road Route runs
south along Maner Road for approximately 2 miles from
its intersection with RR 783 to Red Bluff Road where the
route terminates.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that the Doss South
Routes have not been previously surveyed for cultural
resources and previously recorded sites are located within
the ROW of the Doss South Routes. A total of six previ­
ously recorded sites and one NRHP property are located
within a 1-mile radius of the Doss South Routes. Of the
six previously recorded sites within the search radius,
two are lithic scatters (41GL190 and 41GL336), three are
open campsites (41GL191, 41GL193, and 41GL194), and
one has an unknown affiliation (41GL292). The Pecan

Creek Schoolhouse is located along Pecan Creek Road,
approximately 50 m northeast of the road and the project
APE in Route 1F-12. The schoolhouse was built in 1916
and is constructed of limestone. The site was listed on the
NRHP in 2005.

results of survey
route if-12 and 1f-12-19
The vast majority of Routes 1F-12 and 1F-12-19 are domi­
nated by exposed bedrock and thin, clayey upland soils. The
Flores and Moccasin creek crossings and the Pecan Creek
tributaries are incised into bedrock with gravel bars adjacent
to the roadway. No alluvial terraces or fine sediments were
present that displayed the capacity to hold cultural deposits.
Several areas along the route display heavy disturbances
throughout the ROW and include cut and fill sections,
bulldozed areas with associated berms, drainage ditches,

41

residential driveways, existing surficial and subsurface
utilities, and other miscellaneous disturbances associated
with roadway construction and maintenance. Some natural
chert nodules were noted in places with exposed bedrock
but no evidence of lithic procurement locales was observed.
Site 41GL402 was recorded as a result of the survey efforts
along Route 1F-12. The site is a historic rectangular stonelined pit feature that is possibly the basement of a larger
removed, aboveground structure and is located just outside
of the ROW boundary.
Route 1F-12-19 runs adjacent to Nixon Creek Road and
traverses the same general topography as Route 1F-12
with a broad rocky upland and moderate disturbances
from residential development along the ROW and roadway
maintenance. Due to the upland nature of the routes and
the overall lack of soils, no shovel tests were conducted
throughout Routes 1F-12-19 and 1F-12.

Figure 5.6.

Chapter 5

Survey Results for Zone 2
Overall, Routes 1F-12-19 and 1F-12 displayed no potential
for subsurface cultural deposits due the overall lack of soils.
In addition, aside from historical site 41GL402, no cultural
material or historical features were observed throughout the
APE in Routes 1F-12-19 and 1F-12.

site 41gl402
Site 41GL402 is located just north of Pecan Creek in Route
1F-12. Vegetation across the site consists of short grasses
(due to cattle) and assorted ashe junipers, live oaks, and
mesquite located just beyond the unmarked Pecan Creek
Road ROW. The site consists of a rectangular rock pit fea­
ture measuring 7 x 3 m with a scatter of limestone rocks
spread across a 20 x 20-m area. The pit feature appears to
represent the shallow basement or cellar remains of a larger
structure that has since been removed. Overall, the feature
appears disturbed by road construction with trash and rubble
within and around the pit. The cellar has been partially filled
in with rubble, dirt, and trash. The trash consists of cans
that range in age from recent to historic (early twentieth
century). A scatter of limestone rocks around the pit could
be in association with the removed structure. The walls of
the cellar remnant are uncut, dry-laid limestone. The site is
in an area of assorted surficial cobbles and gravels over shal­
low bedrock that is exposed in places in and around the site.
The pit feature is located just outside of the Pecan Creek
Road ROW. However, a portion of the site consisting only
of a scattering of limestone boulders extends into the proj­
ect APE. No historic artifacts or associated historic-age
features were noted within the current APE. The primary
feature of the site is the pit itself, which has been heavily
impacted by roadway construction and maintenance as well
as cattle grazing. The associated limestone boulder scatter
is merely a product of the deterioration of the pit feature,
and as such does not represent a significant component of
the site. Additionally, the proposed APE will be installed
close to the existing road pavement and will not impact the
structural remnant. At this time, the SAL eligibility status
of 41GL402 is undetermined as the site was not formally
investigated beyond the current ROW boundary. Should
construction activities propose to impact the pit feature,
then additional survey efforts along with archival research
would be warranted to adequately determine the age and
affiliation of the pit feature. Again, the proposed undertak­
ing will not adversely impact the portion of the site that
extends into the project area. With this in mind, no further
work is recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41GL402.

route 4f
The northern portion of Route 4F runs east-west, crossing
Edwards Creek, before heading in a southwest direction
to its southern terminus. The northern portion of the route
predominantly traverses shallow uplands. The southwest

43

bearing portion of the route predominantly traverses the
alluvial terraces of Threadgill Creek, crossing the creek
itself at two locations and three unnamed tributaries of the
creek. A total of 21 shovel tests was excavated throughout
Route 4F, mostly along the southern portion of the route.
The shovel tests typically encountered dry compact silt
loams that ranged in depth from a shallow 10–80 cmbs. The
deeper shovel tests typically encountered calcium carbon­
ate inclusions and gravels at an average depth of 50 cmbs.
Several flakes were observed both on the surface and in
several positive shovel tests at three newly recorded sites
(41GL403, 41GL404, and 41GL405) along the southeast
bearing portion of the route. Overall, the sites consist of a
surficial scatter of lithics with only site 41GL403 having
subsurface artifacts recovered at a maximum depth of 40
cmbs.
Disturbances along the Route 4F APE include cut and fill
sections, drainage ditches, residential driveways, existing
surficial and subsurface utilities, concrete aprons at several
crossings, and other disturbances associated with roadway
construction and maintenance. Although the majority of
the route is in close proximity to Threadgill Creek, none
of the shovel tests encountered deep alluvial deposits. In
addition, all cultural material was observed either on the
surface or at depths no deeper than 40–50 cmbs. Based on
the results of the shovel tests, no backhoe trenching was
deemed necessary along Route 4F.

site 41gl403
Site 41GL403 is located on the northern high terrace of
Threadgill Creek, on RR 783 between the first and second
crossing of the creek in Route 4F (Figure 5.7). The site is
composed of a scattering of lithic debitage and burned rock
noted on the surface and within six positive shovel tests
(Figure 5.8). Surface artifacts were observed in two broad
concentrations that appeared to be eroding from the steep
shoulder along the northern portion of the ROW.
Over the course of two field visits, a total of 10 shovel
tests was excavated across the site. These subsurface tests
encountered compacted silt loams atop limestone bedrock
at 45 cmbs. Additional artifacts were observed eroding
from a road cut on the northern portion of the ROW at a
general depth of 50–75 cmbs. No diagnostic artifacts were
observed in the investigated portion of the site. Overall,
due to the presence of subsurface cultural materials and
features, further work is needed to identify the exact chro­
nology, contexts, and significance of the site. Therefore
the SAL eligibility status of site 41GL403 is undetermined
and avoidance is recommended. HCTC has subsequently
agreed to avoid impacts to the site by directional boring
underneath the site. As such, site 41GL403 does not stand
to be impacted by the proposed undertaking.

the current ROW. Artifacts observed include several flakes
and five cores isolated to a slight road cut portion of the
roadway along the northwestern ROW boundary of RR 783.
The site appears to be within a natural chert outcropping,
as the artifacts appeared to be evenly dispersed across the
landscape. Vegetation is mainly maintained grasses in the
ROW with small clusters of live oak beyond the ROW.
The site dimensions measure 75 m (northeast-southwest)
by 10 m (northwest-southeast) within the current ROW. No
shovel tests were conducted on site 41GL405 due to the
lack of soils, roadway-related disturbances, and the pres­
ence of exposed bedrock throughout the site. Based on the
disturbances from roadway construction and the scarcity of
artifacts, the portion of the site that extends into the APE
has little to no research value. Therefore, the portion of the
site within the HCTC APE does not meet the criteria for
designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended
in the HCTC APE at site 41GL405.

site 41gl404

doss red bluff road route

Site 41GL404 is located along RR 783 just south of a
meander of Threadgill Creek in Route 4F. The site is a
light surficial lithic scatter that likely extends northwest
and southeast of the current ROW. The investigated por­
tion of the site measures 250 m (northeast-southwest) by
10 m (northwest-southeast) along the relatively flat ROW
of RR 783. The two shovel tests conducted within the site
boundaries encountered dry, compact silty loams with an
average depth of 25 cmbs.

The Red Bluff Road Route extends south along Maner
Road from the northern portion of Route 4F, roughly par­
alleling Edwards Creek. Overall, the route’s topography
is extremely similar to Route 4F with the northern extent
located on shallow uplands before crossing Edwards Creek
approximately 0.65 mile south of RR 783. The route then
continues to traverse the creeks narrow alluvial terraces
toward the routes southern terminus. In the vicinity of
the Red Bluff Road Route, the creek incises limestone
bedrock with alluvial deposits consisting of gravel bars
immediately adjacent to the waterway and a narrow band
of shallow fine sediment alluvium just beyond the gravel
bars. Portions of the project cross these alluvial sediments
and were investigated with a total of 28 shovel tests. The
shovel tests typically encountered shallow deposits aver­
aging 27 cm in depth sitting atop limestone bedrock. The
high number of shovel tests along the 2-mile route was
due to the large amount of cultural material encountered
in association with four new archaeological sites recorded
along the route. Sites 41GL406 to 41GL409 are surficial and
shallowly buried prehistoric lithic and burned rock scatters
with site 41GL406 containing a small burned rock midden
just beyond the project ROW.

Overall, no diagnostics, features, or subsurface cultural
material was observed within the project APE or in the RR
783 ROW. However, additional investigations are needed to
determine the extent of deposits beyond the current ROW.
Disturbances within the investigated portion of the site are
typical of those observed related to roadway construction
such as a slight cut section, a shallow drainage parallel to
the roadway, and vegetation clearing of the entire ROW.
Based on the disturbances from roadway construction and
the scarcity of artifacts, the portion of the site that xtends
into the HCTC APE does not represent a significant com­
ponent of the overall site.
Therefore, based on these observations, the portion of the
site that extends into the HCTC APE does not meet the
criteria for designation as an SAL. No further work is rec­
ommended in the HCTC APE at site 41GL404.

site 41gl405
Site 41GL405 is located along RR783 in Route 4F, 0.5 mile
south of the Becker Road cut-off. The site is a light surficial
lithic scatter observed within the RR 783 ROW and likely
extends northwest of the current ROW boundary. The area
is on uplands west of a north bearing meander of Threadgill
Creek. Investigations throughout the site were limited to

Overall, the Red Bluff Road Route displayed the least
amount of disturbances of the all the Doss South routes.
However, disturbances in association with Maner Road
are still present. These include cut and fill sections near
Edwards Creek, residential driveways, existing utilities,
and other miscellaneous disturbances associated with road­
way construction and maintenance. Based on the results of
the shovel tests and the shallow nature of the deposits, no
backhoe trenching was deemed necessary along the Red
Bluff Road route.

site 41gl406
Site 41GL406 is located along Maner Road along the Red
Bluff Road route, approximately 1 mile south of RR 783.
The site is a broad surficial and buried prehistoric campsite
with one small burned rock midden just beyond the ROW.
The investigated portion of the site is located on an old
upland terrace west of Edwards Creek in the Maner Road
ROW. The site appears to extend east of the roadway to­
wards Edwards Creek and west into a cultivated field. An
occasional surficial flake was observed in the plowed and
recently cleared field west of the current ROW. The site has
two main areas of artifact concentration, each are located
on the east side of the road. One is a dense surficial lithic
scatter in the southern portion of the site within the Maner
Road ROW. A heavily patinated, Late Archaic Montell pro­
jectile point was recovered from the surface in this scatter.
The second artifact concentration is the small burned rock
midden with associated deposits located in the northern
portion of the site. The burned rock midden is located east
of the current ROW, well outside the APE, and appears to
measure approximately 3 x 3-m with a 30–50 cm thickness,
composed of small 5–10-cm-long burned rock fragments.
Overall, the site measures 180 m (north-south) by approxi­
mately 40 m (east-west). Vegetation is mainly maintained
grasses in the road ROW with a thin line of live oak and ashe
juniper along the creek, just east beyond the ROW. A total
of nine shovel tests was excavated within the site boundar­
ies, all of which typically encountered hard compacted clay
soils with calcium carbonate at 60 cmbs. Several shovel
tests were positive, usually with a few (less than 5 cm)
small flakes that appear to have worked their way into the
subsurface clays. Although the site is composed of upland
(old terrace) Lewisville clay loam, portions of the site, east
of the ROW, may contain more substantial buried deposits.
Disturbances include those associated with typical roadway
construction and maintenance. While the proposed APE
runs through the site, it will be installed directly adjacent to
the existing roadway pavement. This area has been modified
and heavily disturbed, and therefore the portion of the site
that extends into the project APE has little to no contextual
integrity. The remainder of the site, outside of the ROW
boundary, appears to be relatively intact judging by the pres­
ence of a fairly cohesive burned rock feature along with a
dense concentration of artifacts. Presently, the vertical and
horizontal extents of the site have not fully delineated as
survey efforts were generally restricted to the Maner Road
ROW. As such, the SAL eligibility status of the portion of
site 41GL406 outside of the APE is undetermined. Should
construction activities extend beyond the current Maner
Road ROW, then additional survey or testing efforts may
be warranted to determine the significance of the remainder
of the site. Presently, however no avoidance of the portion
of the site that extends into the APE is recommended due

to the severely disturbed and surficial nature of the artifact
assemblage in this area.

site 41gl407
Site 41GL407 is located along Maner Road in the Red Bluff
Road route, approximately 0.75 mile south of RR 783. The
site is a surficial and buried prehistoric campsite with scat­
tered burned rock. The site extends slightly east but mainly
west of the current Maner Road ROW, approximately 60 m
south of the route’s crossing of Edwards Creek. The road
appears to have cut through the eroding, eastern edge of
the site. Vegetation is mainly maintained grasses in the road
ROW with thick stands of live oak and ashe juniper just
beyond the ROW toward the creek. No ROW fence line is
present at the site location. Overall, the site measures 70 m
(north-south) x 40 m (east-west). Although no diagnostic
artifacts were observed on the surface or in any of the shovel
tests, the presence of a large biface fragment may suggest
a Late Archaic affiliation. In general these larger bifaces
tend to be associated with Late Archaic deposits (Miller
2007). A total of five shovel tests was excavated within
the site and typically encountering compacted silt loams
with heavy calcium carbonate past 40 cmbs. Disturbances
include those associated with typical roadway construction
and maintenance. The fiber APE through the site is closely
aligned with the road pavement, offset by only 2–3 feet on
the eastern side. This area directly adjacent to the road is
highly modified and disturbed, forming the eastern edge
of the site. Therefore, while the portion of site 41GL407
west of the road has an undetermined SAL eligibility status,
the portion of the site traversed by the APE is in very poor
condition, with no apparent, intact subsurface or surface
deposits. Therefore, no further work is recommended in
the HCTC APE at site 41GL407.

site 41gl408
Site 41GL408 is located along Maner Road along the Red
Bluff Road route, approximately 0.5 mile south of RR 783
(Figure 5.9). The site is a surficial and buried prehistoric
campsite composed of lithics and burned rock within the
Maner Road ROW that extends east and west of the current
ROW (Figure 5.10). No ROW fence line is present at the
site location and the fiber APE is closely aligned with the
east side of the road pavement. The site is located on the
opposite side of Edwards Creek from site 41GL407 on a
similar old upland. No formal features were observed in the
investigated portion of the site. However, a somewhat large,
but diffuse midden of ash and burned rock was observed
west of the ROW. In addition, two possible features are
eroding from the slope and a large area of scattered burned
rock and flakes was observed in the western portion of the
current ROW, but outside of the fiber APE. A total of five
shovel test was excavated within the site boundaries with
artifacts recovered at a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. The site

exposed bedrock throughout the site. Additionally, much of
the eastern portion of the site is dominated by a large bull­
dozed area/quarry. Based on the disturbances from roadway
construction and the scarcity of artifacts, the site has little to
no research value within the HCTC APE. Therefore, based
on these observations, the site does not meet the criteria for
designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended
in the HCTC APE at site 41GL409.

measures 160 m (north-south) x 40 m (east-west), with the
east-west dimensions not confirmed due to ROW restric­
tions. Vegetation is mainly maintained grasses in the road
ROW with thick stands of live oak and Ashe juniper beyond
the ROW. Overall, the site is predominantly surficial with
one Pedernales projectile point observed within the site.
Disturbances include those associated with typical roadway
construction and maintenance as well as some vegetation
clearing on the east side of the road. Currently, the proposed
fiber APE traverses the east side of the site. Overall, due to
the presence of subsurface cultural materials and features,
further work is needed to identify the exact chronology,
contexts, and significance of the site. The eligibility status
of site 41GL408 is considered undetermined and avoidance
is recommended. HCTC has agreed to avoid impacts to the
site through directional boring underneath the site. Should
additional construction activities proposed to impact the
site, further survey or testing efforts may be warranted to
determine the cultural significance and eligibility status of
the site.

site 41gl409
Site is located along Maner Road in the Red Bluff Road
route, approximately 0.25 mile south of RR 783. The site is
a surficial lithic procurement area located on a broad upland.
The site is notably lacking tertiary and secondary flakes
with areas of exposed bedrock in the investigated portions
of the site. No diagnostics or burned rock was observed
throughout the site and natural chert outcroppings were
noted near the ROW boundaries. The site dimensions are
130 m (northeast-southwest) by 90 m (northwest-southeast)
with the northwest and southeast boundary likely extending
beyond the current ROW boundaries. Vegetation is mainly
maintained grasses in the road ROW with thick stands of
live oak and ashe juniper beyond the ROW. No shovel tests
were conducted on site 41GL409 due to the presence of

The Doss 5F-26 Route is located along Cut-Off Road
between Maner Road and Doss Springs Creek Road. The
entire route traverses rocky uplands and several areas
displayed exposed bedrock within the project APE. Distur­
bances within the project area were typically associated with
the roadway construction. Based on the upland nature of the
route and the overall lack of soils, only one shovel test was
conducted throughout the Doss 5F-26 Route. Overall, no
cultural material was observed throughout the 5F-26 Route.

doss 5f-38a routes
The Doss 5F-38A-1 Route runs along Old Harper Road
between Maner Road and Doss Springs Creek Road, where
it connects to Route 5F-38A-2. Route 5F-38A-2 then runs
south along Doss Springs Creek Road to U.S. 290 where
it continues east on U.S. 290 to Dinosaur Ranch Road and
runs south near the Skyline Road intersection. Overall, the
Doss 5F-38A routes traverse rolling upland topography and
displayed the most roadway-associated disturbances of all
the Doss South routes. In addition to the typical roadway
alterations displayed on previous routes, these disturbances
included ditching and blading with associated berms, rock
piles along Old Harper Road, and a large fill section near
the heavily modified Dittmar Creek crossing. Based on the
upland nature of the route and large amount of disturbances
and alterations, only seven shovel tests were conducted
throughout the Doss 5F-38A routes, most of which were
isolated to the relatively undisturbed areas along Old Harper
Road (Route 5F-38A-1). No cultural materials were ob­
served throughout the Doss 5F-38A routes.

routes consist of Route 5F-10, Salt Branch Route, Langsmill
Road Route, and Jackrabbit Road Route. Route 5F-10 is
exclusively along RR 783 and terminates just past a large
cleared ROW scar containing several existing pipelines.
The Salt Branch Route is approximately 11.5 miles long
and is located along Salt Branch Loop from its intersection
with RR 783 to East Mill Road. The Langsmill Road and
Jackrabbit Road routes are connected and begin along RR
648, approximately 2,000 feet west of Langsmill Road. The
route then turns north along Langsmill Road to the intersec­
tion with Jackrabbit Road for a distance of 1.9 miles. The
Jackrabbit Road route begins at this location and continues
north for approximately 4.6 miles to just past its intersection
with Threadgill Creek Road in Mason County.
Ground visibility was greater than 70 percent over the
majority of the Doss West routes. The field survey predomi­
nantly encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of
bedrock. However, shovel test excavations were utilized on
a judgmental basis in the public ROW in areas that displayed
the possibility of deeper soils. There were no areas where
backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths had
an average depth of 45 cmbs.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
No previously conducted archaeological surveys have oc­
curred within or adjacent to any of the Doss West routes.
One previously recorded site (41MS68) is recorded within
the Doss West routes while three sites (41GL1, 41GL38,
and 41MS27) are located within 1 mile of the project area.
In addition, four historical markers (Lange’s Mill, St. Peters
Lutheran Church, Doss School, and Squaw Creek Primitive
Baptist Church) and four cemeteries (Ellerbracht Cemetery,
Doss Cemetery, Kensing Cemetery, and Lange Cemetery)
are located within 1 mile of the Doss West routes. None
of the historical markers or cemeteries are located within
the project APE and, therefore, will not be impacted by the
current project.
Site 41MS68, also known as the Ellebracht Homestead,
is located along Jackrabbit Road at its intersection with
Threadgill Creek Road, near the northern extent of the
Jackrabbit Road route. In addition to the historic homestead,
the site contains a dense prehistoric lithic scatter observed
on the surface and in small erosional cuts up to 50 cm in
depth. The site was recorded by Dan Potter of the THC in
2004. The site consists of a two-story cut stone structure
ca. 1910, a dogtrot cabin enclosed in a standing red barn,
a stone barn with rifle ports, and a ruin of a small stone
structure. According to the THC site form, the historic
structures are associated with the Ellebracht family, a fam­
ily of early Texas settlers from Prussia via Fredericksburg
(Site Form 2004).

results of survey
route 5f-10
The southern portion of Route 5F-10 begins in the town
of Doss, Texas before heading north and crossing Onion
Threadgill creeks. Based on the THC’s survey criteria for
this specific project, the majority of the route was vehicle
inspected with only 2.8 miles requiring an intensive survey.
Most of this investigated section of Route 5F-10 is com­
posed of broad uplands displaying extremely shallow sandy
soils overlying red sandstones and limestone. Only the
areas directly adjacent to the creeks showed any potential
for depositional soils. However, the APE at these creek
crossings displayed extensive disturbances from road con­
struction that dominate the entire RR 783 ROW and include
large fill sections and concrete flow conveyance structures.
Due to the limited areas with soils, only five shovel tests
were excavated within Route 5F-10. The five shovel tests
encountered shallow, rocky soils and were negative for
cultural resources.
The survey efforts within the inspected portions of Route
5F-10 resulted in the documentation of site 41GL401.

site 41gl401
Site 41GL401 is a prehistoric lithic procurement area and
is located south of Threadgill Creek on a steeply sloped
shoulder. The site within the RR 783 ROW measures 125
x 40 m and is exclusively surficial due to exposed bedrock
and sandy gravelly soils. A large steeply sloping road cut
dominates the investigated portion of the site along the east
side of road, which contains the APE. Based on the high
amount of larger primary flakes present, the site is likely a
lithic procurement or production site.
The majority of the artifacts were observed in a disturbed
secondary context, having eroded down slope towards the
roadway with a lesser amount located on the west side of
roadway. Overall, the surficial deposits have been subjected
to erosion, road construction and maintenance, and ranch
fence construction. Therefore, the site does not appear to
contain significant, intact, archaeological deposits within
the RR 783 ROW and the APE, and its research potential
is low. The site is not recommended for formal designation
as an SAL.

salt branch looP route
The Salt Branch Loop route is approximately 11.5 miles
long, however only 8.5 miles of the route was surveyed for
cultural resources. The remaining 3 miles traverses private
property.
The disturbances within the inspected portions of the Salt
Branch Loop route included drainage ditches, ROW blad­

ing, fences, intersecting driveways, and roadway construc­
tion and maintenance. Additionally, large portions of the
ROW were extremely narrow varying in width from 2–6
feet. Due to the low probability of cultural material, the
survey was modified to investigate drainage crossings and
areas displaying minimal disturbances. A total of 16 shovel
tests was excavated along the Salt Branch Loop route. One
new site (41MS85) was recorded adjacent to Salt Creek
on a small alluvial terrace. House Hollow Creek displayed
a good potential beyond the current ROW. However, the
project area and the entire Salt Branch Loop ROW dis­
played extensive disturbances from recent ranching and
improvements within the ROW. No cultural material was
observed at House Hollow Creek or throughout the re­
mainder of the Salt Branch route.

site 41Ms85
Site 41MS85 is a scatter of lithics and burned rock located
directly west and adjacent to Salt Creek. The site is isolated
to a narrow alluvial inset terrace west of the creek. The
observed portion of the site measures approximately 15 x 3
m, which includes portions of the APE. Only one flake and
one piece of burned rock were observed in one shovel test
between 20–35 cmbs. However, surficial artifacts appear
to extend for an unknown distance north of the ROW on
private land. Shovel tests placed along the southern por­
tion of ROW and further east and west of the creek were
negative. The artifacts appear to be isolated to the terrace,
which quickly turns to upland topography west of the site
with no artifacts observed. No diagnostics or formal features
were observed.
The current Salt Branch Loop ROW at the site location has
been subjected to erosion, bioturbation, road construction
and maintenance, and ranch fence construction. Artifacts
are very sparse within the ROW, with the observed arti­
facts isolated to a single positive shovel test. Overall, the
site does not appear to contain significant, intact, archaeo­
logical deposits within the Salt Branch Loop ROW or the
APE. Based on these observations, the portion of the site
that extends into the project APE is not recommended for
formal designation as an SAL.

JacKrabbit and langes Mill road routes
The majority of the Jackrabbit and Langes Mill Road routes
traverse upland topography extending from Lehmann
Mountain located just east of the routes. Only 2.2 miles
of the 6.5-mile route were within 500 m of a waterway,
which included the northernmost section of the route near
Threadgill Creek and the southern most extent of the route
where road construction had created large cut and fill sec­
tions, disturbing the original ground surface. Large stretches
of Jackrabbit Road have been recently bulldozed, cleared
of vegetation, and burned in large piles. Due to the lack of

51

soils and the abundant disturbances, no shovel tests were
conducted along the 2.2-mile portion of the Jackrabbit and
Langes Mill Road routes. Previously recorded site 41MS86,
located at the northern extent of the Jackrabbit Road route,
was the only location along the route where artifacts were
encountered within the project ROW.

site 41Ms68
The historic homestead in association with site 41MS68 is
currently occupied and the associated outbuildings are cur­
rently utilized (Figure 5.12). None of the historic structures
will be impacted by the current alignment. The prehistoric
component consists of a large artifact scatter that extends
into the current APE. The prehistoric artifact scatter was
observed on the surface and eroding from small erosional
cuts along the roadway (Figure 5.13). The prehistoric com­
ponent of the site appears to have been disturbed by the
historic structure component of the site, associated ranching
activities, and road grading and maintenance. However, the
cultural deposits observed in the erosional cuts extend from
the surface to approximately 50 cmbs. Further archaeologi­
cal investigations are needed to determine the integrity and
significance of the subsurface prehistoric deposits. Given
the relatively intact nature of the adjacent historic compo­
nent coupled with the buried, intact prehistoric component
within the APE, an avoidance plan was recommended for
the site. Currently, the SAL eligibility status of the site is
undetermined pending further testing and archival research.
HCTC have agreed to comply with the recommended
avoidance plan, and as such, the fiber optic line will be
directionally bored under the site to a depth of 200 cmbs.
This depth will give a 150-cm (approximately 5-foot) buf­
fer between the deepest observed cultural deposits and the
fiber optic line.

Two areas excluded from the survey include a 0.7-mile long
segment along Long Mountain Road in Route 1F-16 and
4 miles along U.S. 377 in Route 1F. The excluded Long
Mountain Road segment is situated beyond 500 m from any
waterway. The Route 1F portion consists of a combination
of areas outside the survey criterion and areas on private
property. The total mileage for the areas excluded from the
survey is approximately 4.5 miles.
Ground visibility was greater than 80 percent over the ma­

encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bed­
rock. However, shovel test excavations were utilized on a
judgmental basis in the public ROW in areas that displayed
the possibility of deeper soils. There were no areas where
backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths
averaged 30 cm.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review for the Streeter West routes deter­
mined that a previous survey was conducted in 1987 by
TxDOT of the areas along U.S. 377 adjacent to Big Bluff
Creek and Little Bluff Creek (SDHPT 1987). The survey
was done in anticipation of bridge replacements over the
two creeks. One prehistoric site (41MS31) was recorded
south of Big Bluff Creek. No other previously conducted
surveys are within or adjacent to the project area.
Two previously recorded sites are mapped within or adja­
cent to the project area (41MS31 and 41MS12). The loca­
tion for the site 41MS31, as recorded on the Atlas, does
not match the site location description on the site form.
The Atlas has the site located 0.7 mile northwest of the in­
tersection of Long Mountain Road and U.S. 377 placing it
adjacent to Route 1F-16. However, the site form states that
the site is located “4.5 miles west of the intersection of US
29 and US 377 on the west bank and terrace of Big Bluff
Creek to the south of highway” (Site Form). This places the
site within the private property portion of Route 1F along
U.S. 377. In addition, the site is associated with the 1987
TxDOT survey of U.S. 377 near Big Bluff Creek. The site
form describes the site as consisting of lithic flaking and
cores observed on the surface in the U.S. 377 ROW. The
site was interpreted to be a prehistoric open campsite of
undetermined age. It was noted that the area of the site in
the present ROW is very shallow and that the majority of
the site is located on the unexamined ranch land south of
the bridge over the creek. However, based on the surficial
nature of the site, no further investigation or listing on the
NRHP was recommended for the site.
There is limited information for site 41MS12, as it appears
to have been initially recorded in the early 1900s and entered
into the site Atlas based on notes and a plotting on a 1936
county highway map. The notes only describe the site as
“Campsite specimens” (Site Form). The Atlas may also have
site 41MS12 mapped in the wrong location. The Atlas has
the site located approximately 3,500 feet west-northwest
of the intersection of Long Mountain Road and U.S. 377
placing it near the mapped location of site 41MS31, and
adjacent to Route 1F-16. However, the site form states that
the site is located on the east side of Leon Creek, 6 miles
west of the Streeter route. This would likely place the site
closer to the intersection of Leon Creek and Evans Road,
just west of U.S. 377. The site form does not contain rec­

ommendations for further investigation or whether the site
is eligible for listing on the NRHP.

results of survey
route if
Route 1F consists is approximately 9 miles long and runs
within and parallel to the U.S. 377 ROW. Approximately
2.2 miles of this route along U.S. 377 will traverse pri­
vate property, and as such, was not surveyed for cultural
resources. Located just east of Big Bluff Creek along this
2.2-mile portion is site 41MS311. Since the route and the
site are located on private property, the site was not revisited
during the survey of Route 1F. No evidence of site 41MS311
was observed within the portion of the project area that is
located within the public ROW.
The remaining 5 miles of Route 1F, located along U.S. 377
and Red Lane, was investigated with an intensive survey.
The survey in this area typically encountered shallow soils
with occasional areas of exposed bedrock, especially in
the portion of the project area. The entire section appears
heavily disturbed by road construction and maintenance
with large berms and cut sections throughout.
Two shovel tests were excavated adjacent to Little Bluff
Creek. The creek crossing is heavily disturbed by large cut
sections into both banks of the creek revealing deep allu­
vial sands. The shovel tests adjacent to the creek revealed
disturbed soils likely related to the removal of soil from
roadway construction. No cultural material was observed in
either shovel test or in the large exposed road cut profiles.
One sparse prehistoric lithic scatter (Site 41MS84) was
observed within the portion of Route 1F that is located
within the public ROW.

site 41Ms84
Site 41MS84 is a surficial scatter of prehistoric lithic arti­
facts located in Route 1F along the northern ROW boundary
of U.S. 377. The site is located on a very slight rise bisected
by the northern ROW fence with surficial gravels of sand­
stone throughout the area. Approximately 10 pieces of lithic
debitage were noted on the surface within a 20 x 20-m area.
Since the current investigations were confined to the APE
within the public ROW, the eastern and western boundaries
of the site were not delineated beyond the ROW boundary.
No intact features or diagnostic lithic material was observed
at the site. One shovel test excavated within the site encoun­
tered extremely shallow soils (approximately 3 cm) overly­
ing sandstone bedrock. Therefore, the cultural materials are
isolated to the surface and the thin mantle of soil overlying
the bedrock. The deposits have been subjected to erosion,
bioturbation, road construction and maintenance, telephone
line construction, and ranch fence construction. Overall, the

Survey Results for Zone 2
portion of the site within the public ROW was not found
to contain significant, intact, archaeological deposits and
its research value is low. With this in mind, the portion of
site 41MS84 within the project APE is not recommended
for formal designation as an SAL and no further work is
recommended in this area.

route 1f-7
Route 1F-7 runs parallel to Bluff Creek Road from its in­
tersection with U.S. 377 south for approximately 2.5 miles,
where it will tie in with an existing overhead utility line.
Bluff Creek Road is a maintained gravel road within a nar­
row ROW. However, a ROW boundary fence does not exist
along a large section of eastern portion of the ROW where
the HCTC route is located. Along this route, the line runs 10
feet east and parallel to the actual roadway, predominantly
on a roadway berm likely created by periodic road grad­
ing. An existing buried telephone utility is located directly
adjacent to the proposed route. The entire route runs parallel
with Big Bluff Creek, traversing a combination of upland
areas with exposed bedrock and ancient upland terraces
with surficial gravels. Although a narrow alluvial terrace
runs adjacent to the creek, the APE is isolated to the upland
areas east of the roadway. A total of seven shovel tests was
placed in Route 1F-7. Each shovel test encountered shal­
low sandy soils with larger sandstone cobbles underlain
by degrading sandstone bedrock. No cultural material was
encountered throughout the route.

route 1f-16
Route 1F-16 follows the Long Mountain Road ROW from
the U.S. 377 intersection to 1,000 feet west of Muskhog
Hollow. The route is within a narrow ROW adjacent to a
maintained gravel road. At the southern end of the northsouth running portion of Long Mountain Road is the
remnants of a laid stone rock wall along the eastern ROW
boundary. The rock wall appears heavily disturbed with
areas measuring no higher than a single course of rock
(approximately 10 cm). The rock wall runs parallel and
adjacent to a fence that marks the eastern ROW boundary.
No additional historic structures or cultural materials are
located within the APE or in the vicinity of the rock wall.
Because of the disturbed nature of the rock wall, the lack
of associated diagnostic material, and the abundance of
similar walls throughout the area, the rock wall was not
designated as a site. Additionally, as the project APE will
be located close to the road, the undertaking will not actu­
ally impact the wall.
The majority of Route 1F-16 is along an extremely narrow
ROW with disturbances from road construction and main­
tenance such as periodic road grading. Soils throughout the
investigated potions of Route 1F-16 were predominately
shallow with high gravel content. None of the five shovel

55

tests excavated throughout Route 1F-16 exceeded 20 cm in
depth and no cultural materials were documented.
Additionally, no evidence of the previously recorded sites
41MS12 or 41MS31 were encountered within the project
APE. The areas adjacent to the mapped locations of these
sites were intensively surveyed, however no cultural materi­
als were identified and the areas were found to have been
severely impacted by roadway construction.

route 2f
The 2.1-mile Route 2F runs along Old Junction Road from
Bear Springs Road and continues west along U.S. 377 to
the intersection of Red Lane Road. Old Junction Road
is a maintained gravel county road with an approximate
70-foot-wide ROW. The entire ROW is heavily modified
by roadway construction and maintenance and includes
large cut and leveled areas. In addition, linear drainages
run parallel with the roadway. Soils along this section are
shallow with large areas of exposed bedrock, including an
outcrop of granite boulders near the U.S. 377 intersection.
The boulders likely extended into the ROW prior to the
construction of the roadway. In all, five shovel tests were
excavated within Route 2F, typically encountering shallow
sandy loams with degrading bedrock and gravel inclusions.
One of the shovel tests was excavated in a roadside berm
and encountered disturbed soils to a depth of 80 cmbs. No
cultural material was observed in any subsurface investiga­
tion or on the surface throughout Route 2F.

KateMcy, fredonia, and Pontotoc routes
length: 31.7 miles
Miles surveyed: 29.2 miles
county: Mason and San Saba Counties
number of new sites found: 1
projeCt settIng
The Katemcy, Fredonia, and Pontotoc routes total 31.7
miles and are located northeast of the City of Mason, in
northeastern Mason County and southwestern San Saba
County (Figure 5.15). The routes consist of Katemcy Routes
1F-5 and 3F, Fredonia Routes 1F-5, 50BF, and 50BF-16,
and Pontotoc Routes, 3F, 3F-2, and 6F. From west to east,
Katemcy Routes 1F-5 and 3F are located to the east of
Katemcy Creek, roughly between FM 1222 to the north and
Lang Polk Road to the south. Route 3F parallels Old Mason
Road, just east of Dry Fork Katemcy Creek for approxi­
mately 2.7 miles and Route 1F-5 runs north to south along
Blackjack Road for 3.5 miles. Fredonia Route 1F-5 paral­
lels Deer Creek Cemetery Road and CR 373 in a general
southwest to northeast direction for a total distance of 3.5
miles within the public ROW. Routes 50BF and 50BF-16
are routed southwest to northeast along FM 386 and west
to east along FM 2618 for distances of approximately 5.5

miles and 4.7 miles, respectively. Pontotoc Routes 3F and
6F parallel RR 501 for distances of approximately 3.5 miles
and 4 miles to the north and south of the City of Pontotoc.
Route 3F-2 runs perpendicular to Route 3F, along CR 359
for approximately 2.8 miles.
Due to the upland setting of the project area, a large por­
tion of the combined routes traverses areas of exposed
bedrock. These areas were subject to visual inspection and
documented photographically, without the use of shovel
testing for buried deposits. Ground visibility was typically
greater than 50 percent over the majority of these routes.
The field survey predominantly encountered shallow soils
and frequent outcrops of bedrock. However, shovel test
excavations were utilized on a judgmental basis in the public
ROW in areas that displayed the possibility of deeper soils.
There were no areas where backhoe trenching was needed
as observed soil depths seldom exceeded 80 cm within the
project area.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that two linear ar­

chaeological surveys were conducted within the proposed
Fredonia Route 50F-16 and one area survey was conducted
adjacent to the proposed Pontotoc Routes 3F and 3F-2.
In 1975 and 1977, the TDHPT sponsored archaeological
investigations along FM 2618 (Route 50F-16) between
FM 386 and Fly Gap Road (RM 1900). As a result of
these surveys, a total of approximately 7 miles of highway
ROW was investigated, and no archaeological sites were
recorded. In 1998, Anthony and Brown Consulting surveyed
an 80-acre tract for the proposed SERI Pontotoc Pilot Plant
at the northeast corner of RM 501 (Route 3F) and CR 359
(Route 3F-2). One new site, 41SS160, was recorded as a
result of these investigations and previously recorded site
41SS14 was revisited. Neither of these sites was considered
significant or recommended for further work.
No previously recorded sites are documented within any
of the Katemcy, Fredonia, and Pontotoc routes. However,
three previously recorded sites consisting of two prehistoric
lithic scatters (41SS14 and 41SS160) and one open campsite
(41SS14) are located within 1 mile of the various routes.
In addition, two cemeteries and two historical markers are
located near the project area along Fredonia Route 50BF and
Pontotoc Route 3F. The Old Pontotoc Cemetery is located
within the City of Pontotoc, on the east side of RM 501.
The cemetery is fenced and located outside of the ROW
and will not be affected by the currently proposed project.
An Official State of Texas Historical Marker (OSHM) for
the Pontotoc and San Fernando Academy is located on the
west side of RM 501 within the city limits, approximately
130 m west of the proposed project area. The Walgram
Cemetery is located on the north side of FM 386 approxi­

57

mately 3 miles southwest of Fredonia. The earliest burial
in this cemetery dates to 1880 and it is still in use today. In
2002, an OSHM was dedicated for the cemetery that was
created to serve the settlers of Blue Stretch, later known as
Walgram (Atlas). This cemetery and its associated historical
marker are located outside of the proposed alignment and
will not be affected by the current project.

results of survey
KateMcy routes 1f-5 and 3f
Katemcy Route 3F roughly parallels Dry Fork Katemcy
Creek for 2.7 miles along Old Mason Road. The vast major­
ity of Route 3F is characterized by heavily disturbed ROW,
outcropping granite, and degrading granite bedrock. Devils
Spring, an unnamed Devils Spring tributary, and two un­
named Dry Fork Katemcy Creek tributaries are crossed by
the proposed alignment. Shovel tests were excavated at all
of these drainage locales, however, very little soil was en­
countered. Surface visibility averaged 70 percent and much
of the route has been impacted by road construction and
maintenance activity. Soil and gravels from road grading
has been pushed into the ROW and a low berm of dirt and
gravel also exists along the fenceline within the APE. A total
of seven shovel tests was excavated along Route 3F, all of
which were negative for cultural material. Soil depth ranges
between 25–56 cmbs before terminating at bedrock in all
areas. No previously recorded sites were located within the
Route 3F project area and no new sites were recorded as a
result of the current investigation.
Katemcy Route 1F-5 follows Blackjack Road and is ap­
proximately 3.5 miles long. This road is well maintained
and nearly the entire width of the ROW throughout the
project area has been graded. Narrow areas that were not
graded were sloped from the edge of the roadway to the
ROW fenceline and did not require shovel testing due to
the uneven surface. Bedrock is prevalent at the surface
throughout much of the route, exposed by grading of the
thin soil. The entire project area was visually inspected and
photographed, however, no shovel tests were excavated due
to heavy disturbance. No cultural resources were encoun­
tered along Route 1F-5.

fredonia routes 1f-5, 50bf, and 50bf-16
Fredonia Route 1F-5 parallels Deer Creek Cemetery Road
and CR 373 in a general southwest to northeast direction
for a total distance of 3.4 miles within the public ROW.
The 1.5 miles of proposed overhead utility was not subject
to investigation under the current survey. The remaining
portion of proposed line was located within an area of
exposed limestone bedrock. A total of eight shovel tests
was excavated, the deepest of which was 70 cmbs. Shovel
tests ranged in depth from 10–20 cmbs and consisted of

58

Chapter 5

sandy loam underlain by degrading bedrock. No prehistoric
or historic cultural materials were found along Fredonia
Route 1F-5.
Route 50BF parallels the east side of FM 386 for ap­
proximately 5.5 miles. Much of this route is composed of
undulating hills with exposed limestone bedrock within the
project APE. Road construction, maintenance and existing
buried utilities have severely impacted the narrow ROW in
this area. A total of 25 shovel tests was excavated in areas
adjacent to Willow Creek and other unnamed drainages.
Within these shovel tests, bedrock was typically encoun­
tered at 10–30 cmbs with only a single shovel test extending
to a full meter below the surface. No cultural materials were
identified either on the surface or within the 25 shovel tests
excavated along Route 50BF.
Fredonia Route 50BF-16 runs to the east along FM 2618 for
a distance of approximately 4.7 miles from its intersection
with FM 386. This area was surveyed in 1975 and 1977 by
the TDHPT, however, no previously identified sites were
located within the current APE. General topography consists
of smooth and rolling hills, dissected by Willow Creek, East
Willow Creek, and several unnamed drainages. As such,
investigations along Route 50BF-16 focused on the areas
adjacent to these waterway crossings. Portions of the project
area were heavily disturbed due to roadway construction
and maintenance activity. Sandy loam with high quartzite
and sandstone gravel content was encountered throughout
the project area, and shovel tests typically reached depths
of 70–100 cmbs before terminating at bedrock. A total of
44 shovel tests was excavated along Route 50BF-16, seven
of which were positive for cultural material. One new ar­
chaeological site (41SM86) was recorded as a result of the
survey efforts along Route 50BF-16.

site 41Ms86
Site 41MS86 is located approximately 3 miles east of FM
386 on the east and west sides of East Willow Creek. The
site is situated within a low-lying creek valley that contains
split branches of Willow Creek. The terrace is abrupt to the
west of the creek and gradual to the east. Vegetation on the
site consists of thick grass, which obscures much of the
ground surface, affording less than 10 percent surface vis­
ibility. A total of 15 shovel tests was utilized to delineate the
site boundaries within the APE, seven of which contained
buried cultural material. Many of these shovel tests recorded
heavy disturbance in the upper 50 cm of sediment. Artifacts
were found at a depths ranging from 20–70 cmbs, with no
artifacts visible on the surface within the project area. Site
41MS86 measures approximately 200 m east-west, where
it is bounded by negative shovel tests by 50 m north-south,
where it is defined by the limits of the public ROW.

Artifacts recovered included eight chert flakes, two quartzite
flakes, and three bone fragments (although no definitively
cultural material was found in direct association with the
bone). No tools or diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
There was no discernable stratification within the site soil
deposits, nor were any intact features encountered. Due to
the proximity to multiple branches of Willow Creek, site
41MS86 likely represents an ephemeral open campsite. The
portion of the site within the APE has little to no research
value due to the sparse artifact recovery and a high level
of disturbance from roadway construction. It is the opinion
of SWCA that site 41MS86 does not meet the criteria for
designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26.12, and
accordingly, no further work is recommended within the
HCTC APE. If future work is to impact the area outside
of the ROW, then additional survey investigations may be
warranted to fully delineate the site boundaries beyond the
road ROW.

Pontotoc routes 3f, 3f-2 and 6f
Pontotoc Route 3F parallels RM 501 for approximately
3.5 miles from the City of Pontotoc north to CR 375. Ap­
proximately 1 mile of the proposed route falls to the west
of the public ROW and was therefore not subject to survey.
Disturbance due to roadway construction and maintenance
was observed throughout the project area and is much more
prevalent in the southern portion of the alignment near the
City of Pontotoc. The Old Pontotoc Cemetery is also located
along the east side of RM 501 near the southern terminus
of Route 3F. The cemetery is fenced and completely lo­
cated outside of the project APE. This adjacent area was
investigated but no evidence of additional interments was
observed within the project area. Throughout the project
area, soils were generally shallow and shovel tests were
terminated at depths ranging from 10–30 cmbs due to the
presence of bedrock.
Quartzite cobbles were occasionally dense on the surface
and within some of the shovel tests, however, none showed
any evidence of cultural manipulation. A total of 17 shovel
tests was excavated along Route 3F, all of which were nega­
tive for cultural material. No new sites were recorded along
Route 3F as a result of the current investigation.
Pontotoc Route 3F-2 spurs off of Route 3F and RM 501
along the north side of CR 359 and continues east for ap­
proximately 2.8 miles. CR 359 is heavily graded, which
typically extends to within 2 feet of the ROW fenceline.
Exposed bedrock and eroded stream channels are also pres­
ent within the proposed alignment, limiting the possibility
of site burial. A total of six shovel tests was excavated
within the proposed Route 3F-2 alignment, all of which
were negative for cultural material. Three pieces of chert
debitage were observed on the ground surface in an area that
was heavily disturbed, however, no buried cultural material

Survey Results for Zone 2
was recovered from shovel tests excavated nearby. Due to
the scarcity of artifacts and disturbed nature of the area,
this location was not recorded as an archaeological site.
No new sites were recorded along Route 3F-2 as a result
of the current investigation.
Route 6F follows the ROW fenceline along RM 501 from
SH 71 in the City of Pontotoc south for approximately
4 miles to Newsom Cemetery Road. Most of the project
APE exhibits evidence of grading, and piles of dirt from
this activity are present within the ROW creating a berm of
disturbed soil. In areas where the natural elevation was vis­
ible, bedrock is typically exposed at the surface. The areas
to the north and south of San Fernando Creek are heavily
disturbed as a result of road construction and maintenance
activity. A total of 17 shovel tests was excavated along
Route 6F, all of which were negative for cultural material.
No artifacts were observed within the Route 6F project area
and no new archaeological sites were recorded as a result
of the current investigation.

zone 3
Zone 3 is located in Edwards, Kerr, Kendall and Real coun­
ties and is composed of a total of four separate project areas
(Table 6.1, Figure 6.1). The routes have a total length of
approximately 51.8 miles. Within Zone 3, a total of 40.57
miles of the proposed route alignment was surveyed for
cultural resources resulting in the documentation of one
new archaeological site and the revisit of one previously
recorded archaeological site. Survey efforts within Zone 3
took place between June 2008 and April 2009. The results
of each of these field projects are detailed in individually
submitted interim reports, however a synopsis of each in­
vestigation is presented here (see Appendix A).

projeCt settIng
The Byas Springs Road route and the RR 479 route totals
2.75 miles and are located north central Kerr County, just
east of the small town of Mountain Home along IH-10
(Figure 6.2). The RR 479 route is composed of Routes
61 and 6F-6 and begins on the west side of RR 479 at its
intersection with Elizabeth Drive. The route follows the
RR 479 ROW south and terminates near the intersection
with SH 27. The Byas Springs Road route (6F-5) begins
at the intersection of SH 27 and Byas Springs Road. It
follows the south side of Byas Springs Road west for 1.04
miles, where it connects with an existing overhead utility
on private property.

Table 6.1.

Ground visibility was greater than 80 percent over the ma­
jority of the project area. The field survey predominantly
encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bedrock
(Figures 6.3). However, shovel test excavations were used
on a judgmental basis in the public ROW in areas that
displayed the possibility of deeper soils. There were no
areas where backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil
depths did not exceed 30 cm nor were alluvial terraces with
fine sediments observed in the project area.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that a previous survey
was conducted in 1971 by the Texas Water Development
Board on behalf of the Texas Historical Survey Committee
of the area along Byas Springs Road, adjacent to Johnson
Creek (Briggs 1970). The survey was done in anticipation
of the construction of Ingram Reservoir. Numerous pre­
historic sites were recorded, predominately south of Byas
Springs Road and along Johnson Creek. The same survey
encompasses an area along Dry Creek that parallels RR 479,
near the route’s intersection with SH 27. A separate survey
was conducted by the THC in 1971 along Dry Creek in the
vicinity of previously recorded sites 41KR16 and 41KR18
(Atlas). No other previously conducted surveys are within
or adjacent to the project area.
One previously recorded site (41KR16) is mapped adjacent
to the RR 479 Route. Thirty-nine other sites are within 1
mile of the two routes. These sites include mainly prehis­
toric burned rock middens, a few surficial lithic scatters,
and a historic residence.
Site 41KR16, a prehistoric campsite, was recorded in 1968
by R. E. Gingrich and is located at the transition from the
floodplain to the rocky uplands at the midpoint of the RR
479 Route. While the site form provides limited informa­
tion, the site is apparently a roughly 1-m-high, circular,

in diameter and, according to the site form, roughly onesixth of the site had been destroyed by a bulldozer. While
projectile points were apparently collected from the site,
no types or temporal ranges are listed on the site form. No
recommendations for further work are given, nor is the
significance of the site discussed on the site form.

results of survey
byas sPrings road route
The Byas Springs Road route is roughly 1 mile in length,
running within and parallel to the road ROW from its
intersection with SH 27. The western section of the route
traverses very rocky uplands with little potential for intact,
buried archaeological material. Beyond this point to the
west, the project area traverses private property and was
not surveyed for cultural resources.
Five shovel tests were excavated along the Byas Springs
Road route in locations surrounding the Johnson Creek
crossing. The shovel tests in the northwest and southwest
quadrants of the crossing were shallow due to the presence
of rocky, compact soils, and severe disturbances associated
with the construction of the creek crossing. In addition,
an adjacent vineyard, associated access road, and fences
have heavily impacted the western creek terrace. In the
northeast and southeast quadrants of the creek crossing,
abundant gravels are present overlain by a thin veneer of
fine sediments, creating a low potential for buried, intact
archaeological sites. The three shovel tests excavated in
this area revealed a mix of gravels and sediment, with
extensive disturbances from previous roadway construc­
tion. No cultural materials were observed on the surface
or within the eight shovel tests excavated along the Byas
Springs Road route.

As mentioned, the RR 479 route is almost evenly divided
between uplands and lowland floodplain areas. A total of
13 shovel tests was excavated along RR 479. Shallow soils
consisting of dark clay loam over bedrock are typical in this
section. Much of the ROW along this stretch appears to
have been bladed in recent years, as the ROW is composed
of a nice clear, rocky grassy path with no boundary fence.
Some residences are present at this end of the route and
associated disturbances (driveways, ditches, clearing, etc.)
are more severe in the ROW. Ground visibility provided
good exposures; thus, limiting the shovel tests excavated in
this segment to three (n=3). No cultural materials observed
on the surface or in any excavation in the upland section
of RR 479.
Between 1 and 2 miles south of Elizabeth Drive, the ROW
transitions from the uplands to the floodplain of Dry Branch
and parallels the drainage to the route’s end at SH 27. At the
transition, the route fluctuates between upland areas with
exposed bedrock and ancient upland terraces with surfi­
cial gravels. Previously recorded site 41KR16 is mapped
adjacent to the ROW to the east in this segment near the
entrance to a residential development. This area has been
heavily modified into a ranch entrance with a large gate,
open, shaped grassy terraces, and a concrete creek cross­
ing. No evidence of 41KR16 was observed in the adjacent
ROW of RR 479 or in ST B6, which was excavated in the
ROW opposite the site. About 600 m south of this location
an archaeological site was newly recorded during the cur­
rent survey. Site 41KR675 is a surficial lithic scatter that
occupies a ridge surrounded by current and relict drainage
channels.
The remainder of the route parallels Dry Branch most of
way, and while it appears very high probability on maps,
most of the terraces crossed in this area are T0/T1 gravel
bars with few fine sediment terraces. No substantial ter­
races are located along this segment of the route; instead,
the topography mainly includes low-relief floodplains.
Ground visibility, exposed gravels, bedrock, and very thin
soils provided good exposures; thus, limiting the shovel
tests excavated in this segment to five (n=5). Disturbances
along this section include road construction and mainte­
nance, fences, some ditching, and occasional driveways.
No cultural resources were observed on the surface or in
any of the five shovel tests excavated along this stretch of
the route.

site 41kr675
Site 41KR675 is a surficial scatter of prehistoric lithic
artifacts located along RR 479, about 1 mile north of its
intersection with SH 27 and at the confluence of West
Branch and Dry Branch of the Johnson Creek drainage.

Survey Results for Zone 3 65
The site is located on an upland ridge bisected by the RR
479 ROW with surficial limestone cobbles throughout the
area. Artifacts observed include approximately 30 pieces of
lithic debitage and several cores and crude biface fragments.
The site measures 8 m east-west by 70 m north-south and
appears to have been bisected by the original construction
of RR 479, as archaeological material was observed on both
sides of the road. The size of the site was determined by
observed surface scatters of lithic material. Since the current
investigations were confined to the APE within the public
ROW, the site may extend beyond the ROW boundary to
the east and west. The deposits have been subjected to ero­
sion, bioturbation, and road construction and maintenance.
No intact features or diagnostic lithic material was observed
at the site. One shovel test revealed shallow soil (15 cm of
clay loam and gravel) over bedrock with no intact, buried
archaeological material. Three other excavations near the
site were also negative for cultural resources; although
isolated flakes were observed on the surface in the vicinity
of the shovel tests. Overall, the site does not contain signifi­
cant, intact, archaeological deposits within the APE, and its
research potential is low. Site 41KR675 is not recommended
for formal designation as an SAL.

projeCt settIng
The Garven Store Route 6F begins at the intersection of
Snodgrass Road and SH 41 and continues westward for
approximately 3.75 miles to RR 336. The route continues
south along RR 336 to the intersection of RR 336 and RR
3235. Here the alignment branches, continuing for 2.5 miles
along RR 3235, and southward along RR 336 for 1.91 miles
and then extends eastward on private property for 0.34 mile
(Figures 6.4). The archaeological survey inspected 5.3 miles
of the route, divided into three segments: 1) 3.63 miles
along SH 41 to RR 336 and south of the intersection; 2) 0.7
mile along RR 3235 from RR 336; and 3) 0.9 mile south
of the intersection of RR 3235 for 1 mile along RR 336.
All archaeological investigations were conducted within
the public ROW.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that no archaeological
surveys or previously recorded sites are located within or
directly adjacent to the Garvin Store Route 6F. The nearest
site to the project area is 41RE14, a prehistoric pictograph
site located approximately 2.9 miles east of the south end
of the project area.

results of survey
The Garven Store Route 6F crosses rocky uplands with
shallow to non-existent soils. Much of the route did not
meet THC criteria requiring survey due to its distance
from natural waterways. The areas targeted for intensive
archaeological survey were therefore the drainages crossed
by the route and adjacent areas. The survey supported
these initial assessments as much of the route was found to
traverse exposed limestone and rolling ridgetops (Figures
6.5). Disturbances noted along the route were primarily
from road construction, grading and maintenance activi­
ties, and minor utilities. An existing buried phone line was
noted within the APE.
The segment along SH 41 was the only section containing
soils requiring shovel testing. A total of six shovel tests was
excavated within this area and
depths ranging from 5–20 cmbs. These tests were placed
near the drainages, and their shallow depth demonstrates the
lack of preserved alluvial sediments within the project area.
All of the shovel tests were negative for cultural material.
Portions of the RR 3235 segment were found to have no
fencelines bordering the ROW and the ground surface was
similar to SH 41, with exposed bedrock and little soil. The
unnamed drainage feature crossed in this segment was dry
during the survey and lacked any sediment accumulation
on its banks.
The third segment, along RR 336, is also primarily lime­
stone outcrops with grassy vegetation. One notable oc­
currence in this segment is an approximately 100-m long
exposure of chert eroding from the limestone bedrock. This
area was intensively surveyed for culture material; however,
observed damage to the chert likely resulted from natural
impacts from weathering and fire, and artificial impacts
from construction and maintenance, livestock and ranch­
ing activities. No archaeological sites were detected with
the project APE.

The Mountain Home route follows IH 10 within northern
Kerr County and a small portion of southern Kendall
County, along U.S. 290 (Figure 6.6). The majority of the
APE is southeast of U.S. 290. The longest segment is along
the access road for the eastbound lanes of IH 10. Shorter
segments of SH 27, SH 41, U.S. 290, Stapp Road, and
Midway Road were also surveyed. For the most part, the

was a standing chimney and limestone foundations, and
the historic component of the site was recommended for
further evaluation. No further work was recommended for
the prehistoric component (TARL files).
According to the Atlas database, site 41KR543 is located
at the northeast corner of the intersection of SH 27 and SH
41, within the public ROW. Recorded in 1997, the site is
described as three heavily damaged burned rock middens.
Damage was due to plowing and abundant looting. Artifacts
recovered from the site span the entire Archaic period. No
further work was recommended for the site as it was almost
completely destroyed.

edges of highway ROWs (Figure 6.7). All investigations
were conducted within the public-owned ROW.
Ground visibility was almost always greater than 70 percent,
and based upon the local characteristics and distribution
of known archaeological sites, and the shallow soils and
frequent outcrops of bedrock, the field survey consisted of
shovel test excavations and ground inspection. There were
no areas where backhoe trenching was needed as observed
soil depths did not exceed 70 cm.

The background review determined that a single linear
survey traverses the project APE near Mudge Draw. This
survey was conducted in 1996 by the Archeological Re­
search Lab at Texas A&M University for the All-American
Pipeline. A total of three archaeological sites (41KR229,
41KR230, and 41KR543) are mapped directly adjacent to
or within 100 m of the project APE.
Site 41KR229 is a Middle-to-Late Archaic open campsite
located approximately 50 m southwest of the project APE.
Within the All-American Pipeline ROW, the site measures
150 x 32 m. One midden that measures 11 m in diameter
and one smaller hearth 1 m in diameter were recorded and
tested by Texas A&M University. Investigations included
excavations of 10 shovel tests, four 2 x 2-m units, two 1
x 2-m units, three 1 x 2-m units, and six 1 x 1-m units.
Recovered artifacts included dart points, scrapers, cores,
and debitage. The depth of deposits was from the surface
to 110 cm. The site was not recommended for formal SAL
designation or further work.
Site KR230 was recorded at the same time as 41KR229,
and is located on the right bank of Mudge Draw. The
eastern edge of the site is adjacent to the current project
APE. The site is described as a historic homestead and

The investigations throughout the Mountain Home Route
1F consisted of a combination of shovel testing and recon­
naissance survey. Shovel tests were primarily excavated
adjacent to drainage crossings and in areas of denser veg­
etation and lower ground surface visibility. In areas where
surface visibility exceeded 60 percent, or there was an
abundance of exposed bedrock, a reconnaissance-level
survey methodology was employed.
A total of 40 shovel tests was excavated along the Mountain
Home Route 1F with soil depths ranging from 10–60 cm.
All of the 40 shovel tests excavated along the route were
negative for culture material. No cultural materials were
observed on the ground surface across the APE.
One natural phenomenon noted along sections of the APE,
particularly along IH 10, was concentrations of chert cob­
bles and fractured chert. These accumulations superficially
resemble lithic debitage; however, they lack characteristic
evidence of deliberate human modifications such as pre­
pared platforms and unambiguous percussion marks. The
shatter is more likely the result of several agents, both
natural and man-made, and includes freezing and heating
cycles, erosion, livestock, fire, and mechanical maintenance
from vehicles and especially mowers.
The APE nearest the plotted position of the previously re­
corded site 41KR229 was intensively inspected. Because
of high ground visibility and the lack of soil deposition,
only one shovel test was excavated. No artifacts were ob­
served in the APE, nor were artifacts observed across the
fenceline. The current project will have no effect on site
41KR229, as there is no evidence the site extends into the
current project APE.
An intensive visual inspection and the excavation of three
shovel tests in the APE adjacent to the plotted location of
site 41KR230, found no evidence of the site. As with the
search for 41KR229, ground visibility was high and soil

Site 41KR543 was plotted on the Atlas map as extending
into the project APE; however, an examination of the site
records, site description, and a field inspection concluded
that the site location is misplotted. Site 41KR543 is not
located within the APE, and based upon the original site
documentation at TARL, it is actually located approximately
1.1 km south of the current APE. The current project will
have no effect on site 41KR543, since it not located adjacent
to or near the APE.

The YO and Jackson Ranch routes, located in southwest
and northwest Kerr County and northeast Edwards County,
total approximately 13.32 miles (Figure 6.8). The YO and
Jackson Ranch routes consist of Routes 5F-6, 5F-6-8,
and 7F. The western terminus of proposed Route 5F-6 is
located on private property (Orgain Ranch) on the north
side of Spur 39. Once entering the public ROW adjacent
to this property, the proposed alignment follows Spur 39
and parallels the ROW fenceline for approximately 2.79
miles where it crosses to the east side of FM 187. At this
point, the proposed alignment crosses to the north side of
Spur 39 and continues for approximately 0.88 mile to its
eastern terminus at an existing splice box (3.67 miles total).

With the exception of a very small portion of Route 5F-6
at the west terminus that is located on privately owned
property, all portions of the proposed alignment were sur­
veyed for cultural resources. Ground visibility was typically
greater than 50 percent over the majority of the project area,
ranging between 30 and100 percent. The field survey pre­
dominantly encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops
of bedrock (Figures 6.9). However, shovel test excavations
were utilized on a judgmental basis in areas that displayed
the possibility of deeper soils. There were no areas where
backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths did
not exceed 30 cm.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
No previously conducted archaeological surveys have oc­
curred within or adjacent to any of the routes within the Y
O and Jackson Ranch project areas.
One previously recorded site (41KR1) is recorded immedi­
ately adjacent to Route 5F-6-8 on the east side of FM 187.
In addition to this, site 41KR247 is located within 1 mile
of Route 5F-6-8, just north of the Bandera and Kerr county
line and consists of two Archaic-age burned rock middens
and historic bat guano mines.
Site 41KR1 is a prehistoric site recorded in 1957 by Da­
vid H. Hannah. Records on file at TARL are incomplete,
but indicate that the artifact collection consists of 15 flint
specimens. The collection was donated to “the University”
and catalogued in 1958. Additional remarks refer to “Adam
Wilson for more precise location,” insinuating that the site
location may not be completely accurate. As it is currently
mapped, the western site boundary is just beyond, but adja­
cent to, the east side of the FM 187 ROW near the mid-point
of Route 5F-6-8. (TARL Key Site Card).

routes 5f-6 and 5f-6-8
The vast majority of Routes 5F-6 and 5F-6-8 traverse areas
of exposed bedrock, with little to no top soil. Along the 2.79­
mile stretch between the western terminus of Route 5F-6
and FM 187, large expanses of the gravelly surface were
exposed through thin roadside grasses, affording excellent
surface visibility. Shovel tests were excavated periodically
and revealed very shallow, rocky soils and an absence of

buried cultural material. Approximately 1,200 m west of
FM 187, a laterally fractured, chert biface was encountered
on the ground surface of a hillside. The surface of the entire
area was intensively inspected and one additional chert
flake was observed near the hilltop, approximately 40 m
west of the biface. Surface visibility was approximately
30–60 percent in this area. Heavy sheet erosion has exposed
the limestone bedrock on portions of the hillside, and the
remainder of the surface is very gravelly. Two shovel tests
were excavated near the biface and at the hilltop, but no
additional cultural materials were encountered. Soils within
these two shovel tests were found to consist of very dark
brown silty clay with limestone bedrock present at 5–10
cmbs. It is likely that the artifacts originated on the hilltop
and were washed down the side-slope from their primary
context. Due to the deflated nature of the soils and a lack
of cultural material in primary context, this area was not
recorded as an archaeological site. The remainder of Route
5F-6 was devoid of cultural material.
Immediately east of FM 187, the proposed route crosses to
the north side of Spur 39. Buried utility markers are present
here along the northern ROW fenceline. Near the east end
of Route 5F-6, the points at which a tributary of the South
Fork Guadalupe River crosses the proposed alignment are
severely eroded, with no alluvial soil deposition. Shovel
tests placed on either side of these waterway crossings
revealed soils consisting of very dark brown to dark brown
silty clay underlain by limestone bedrock between 3–20
cmbs. A total of 11 shovel tests was excavated along Route
5F-6 and all were negative for cultural material.
Route 5F-6-8 parallels FM 187 and is entirely within the
public ROW. Disturbances were minimal and consisted
of utilities routed along the ROW fenceline, transmission
line poles that were located within the southern half of the
APE, and small areas of surface modification as a result of
road construction. The general project area is similar to that
of Route 5F-6 with exposed bedrock and thin or no soils.

Outcroppings of naturally occurring chert cobbles were
more common along Route 5F-6-8. Although portions of
the surface are littered with broken chert nodules, only two
culturally manipulated pieces were found outside of the
previously recorded location of site 41KR1. The first was
located approximately 100 m south of the Spur 39 and FM
187 intersection, north of the South Fork Guadalupe River
crossing. This ostensibly cultural artifact was a small chert
core or tested cobble that had been stream-rolled, making
it very smooth, with a polished appearance. The APE was
subject to intensive surface inspection and no additional
artifacts were observed. One shovel test was excavated ap­
proximately 50 m on either side of the surface find and no
cultural material was present. The second artifact observed
within the Route 5F-6-8 APE was encountered approxi­
mately 1.25 miles north of the project area terminus (200
m south of the southern-most drainage crossing), in another
area where naturally fractured chert nodules were scattered
across the surface. A single tertiary flake was noted and a
shovel test was excavated nearby. No cultural materials
were found in the thin layer of topsoil present above the
limestone bedrock.
Near the mid-point of the alignment, the area adjacent to
previously recorded site 41KR1 was investigated through
thorough surface inspection and the excavation of two shov­
el tests. In all, 14 shovel tests were excavated throughout
Routes 5F-6 and 5F-6-8. Aside from the isolated artifacts
noted in various places on the surface throughout the routes,
no new archaeological sites were recorded.

site 41kr1
Site 41KR1 is located near the mid-point of Route 5F-6-8,
on the east side of FM 187 immediately north of a tributary
drainage that feeds into the South Fork Guadalupe River.
The mapped site boundary places the site to the south of
this drainage, and approximately 30 m from the edge of the
roadway, but it was noted in the TARL key site card that
this location is not precise. Vegetation on the site consists
of maintained roadside grasses and a single Ashe juniper
that is located within the ROW (west of the APE). Surface
visibility was approximately 30–60 percent. Approximately
three secondary and tertiary flakes were observed on the
surface along with numerous pieces of naturally fractured
chert, but no subsurface deposition was encountered. The
soil within the two shovel tests excavated on the site con­
sisted of shallow black sandy clay underlain by limestone
bedrock at 5 cmbs. Site dimensions within the APE were
determined on the basis of surface inspection, which limits
the site to an area of approximately 30 m (north to south).
Within the APE, site 41KR1 consists of a very sparse, surfi­
cial scatter of lithic debitage with little to no research value.
Therefore, based on these observations, the site does not
meet the criteria for designation as an SAL. A State of Texas

route 7f
Route 7F follows U.S. 83 and is approximately 5.83 miles
long. The largest waterway crossed by the alignment is
Paint Creek, located at the southern terminus of the route.
Another Paint Creek tributary crosses the project area ap­
proximately 2.5 miles to the north, but it is very small and
neither tributaries presented the potential for alluvial soil.
The APE is characterized by large expanses of exposed
limestone bedrock and thin, sandy gravelly soil. Buried util­
ity markers are located along the ROW fenceline throughout
the entirety of the project area. Within the northern half of
the APE, transmission line poles are placed at regular in­
tervals along the fenceline. In addition to this disturbance,
several residential driveways cross the APE, and at two
locations, concrete slabs have been poured for the United
States Postal Service residential mailboxes. Due to the
absence of soil and moderate disturbance, only two shovel
tests were excavated within the APE for Route 7F. Both of
these shovel tests were negative for cultural material and
were terminated at a maximum depth of 15 cmbs. The re­
mainder of the route was visually inspected and no cultural
resources were observed on the surface. No archaeological
sites were identified within the APE for the current project.

zone 4
Zone 4 is located in Bandera, Medina, Real, and Uvalde
counties and is composed of five separate project areas
(Table 7.1, Figure 7.1). A total of 76.52 miles of telecom­
munications cables will be installed throughout Zone 4. Of
this total, 61.03 miles were surveyed for cultural resources
between July of 2008 and April of 2009. The survey resulted
in the documentation of five new archaeological sites and
the revisit of six previously recorded archaeological sites.
The results of each of these field projects are detailed in
individually submitted interim reports, however a synopsis
of each investigation is presented here (see Appendix A).

The Frio Canyon to SWTTC Boundary Route IF-26 begins

The background review determined that one previous
survey was conducted by SWCA in 2005 for TxDOT of
the RR 1050 ROW, from RM 187 in Utopia, west to the
intersection of U.S. 83 (Lawrence and Acuña 2005). The
survey encompasses the current FM 1050 portion of the
project area with no sites recorded in the current APE. Ad-

ditionally, no previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within or immediately adjacent to the project APE.
Six previously recorded sites are located within 1 mile of
the APE. These include three prehistoric open campsites
(41UV449, 41UT468, and 41UV156) and three open camp­
sites with middens (41UV471, 41UV157, and 41UV158).

results of survey
The length of the route is within the proscribed 500-m
vicinity of natural waterways, and therefore subject to
an archaeological survey. The archaeological survey was
conducted on public ROW and all shovel tests were exca­
vated on public owned property. The field survey efforts
throughout the Frio Canyon to SWTTC Boundary Route
1F-26 encountered predominately shallow soils within the
heavily disturbed ROW (Figure 7.3). Because of the high
degree of ground visibility and the lack of soil deposition,
only three shovel tests were excavated. The three excavated
shovel tests ranged in depth from 5–30 cm and were nega­
tive for cultural resources.
No alluvial deposits capable of harboring deep, intact ar­
chaeological deposits were noted, even within the portions
of the APE that are near the Frio River. Several drainages
traversed by the APE include Cherry and Pailing creeks.
An examination of these crossings found the channels to be
bedrock-lined with banks composed of limestone outcrops,
gravels and cobbles. The eastern end of the project area rises
above the channel terraces to an upland saddle between
two hill tops, where the surface is exposed and fractured
limestone. The route descends eastward from the saddle,
terminating mid-slope, and above the flood plain and lower
terraces of Blanket Creek. Observed disturbances through­
out the ROW include a buried phone cable, and spoil piles
of construction and maintenance debris. Overall, no cultural
resources were observed in the entire APE.

Only sites 41UV86 and 41UV88 appear to have had data
recovery excavations.
An additional survey of RR 1051 was conducted by TxDOT
in 2004. The survey covered RR 1051 from its intersection
with U.S. 83 to approximately 5 miles north. Similar to the
previous TxDOT survey, limited information was available
on the investigations; however, no sites were recorded in
association with the survey.

The most recent survey along the project area was con­
ducted by SWCA in 2005 (Chavez and Lawrence 2005).
The survey reevaluated 2.25 miles of RR 1051, from the
U.S. 83 intersection to just south of the Aldine Cemetery.
In addition, the survey investigated the RR 1051 ROW
adjacent to previously recorded site 41UV88, the Wood­
row Heard Site. The main objective of the survey was to
investigate three locations with cultural material unearthed
during construction for improvements to RR 1051. Overall,
this survey documented two prehistoric sites (41UV446 and
41UV447) and relocated previously recorded site 41UV371.
A total of 10 previously recorded sites are located within
or directly adjacent to the project APE.

The Frio Canyon–Reagan Wells route, located in Uvalde
and Real counties, begins at the intersection of U.S. 83
and CR 183 and continues west along U.S. 83 for approxi­
mately 3.3 miles to RR 1051 (Figure 7.4). The route then
continues north along RR 1051 for approximately 18 miles
to the end of the public access portion of the road, 3.5 miles
north of the Real County line. The majority of the route
was intensively surveyed by the current investigation aside
from a 1.2-mile section along U.S. 183 and a 5-mile sec­
tion along the southern end of RR 1051. Ground visibility
in the investigated segments was greater than 70 percent
over the majority of the project APE. The intensive field
survey consisted of intermittent shovel test excavations and
ground inspection. All shovel tests were in the public ROW
and were excavated on a judgmental basis. There were no
areas where backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil
depths did not exceed 40 cm.

The background review determined that portions of RR
1051 have been previously surveyed on behalf of TxDOT
in 1981. Although limited information is available about
this survey, a review of site forms and data recovery reports
of sites found during the survey has provided some basic
information (Black et al. 1997; Decker et al. 2000). The
1981 TxDOT survey was conducted for the expansion of
RR 1051 from Reagan Wells to an unknown location to

Site 41UV85 is located 0.5 mile south of RR 1051’s sixth
crossing of the Dry Frio River, just south of the CumminsHeard Cemetery. The site is recorded as a large outcrop of
flint cobbles and pebbles with limited activity. This is the
only site of the six sites recorded during the 1981 TxDOT
survey in which no further work was recommended.

Site 41UV83 is located just north of Reagan Wells, ap­
proximately 1 mile north of RR 1051’s fifth crossing of the
Dry Frio River. The site is recorded as a scatter of burned
rocks and lithics across an approximately 300–400-foot­
wide and 0.5-mile-long area. No features or middens are
noted on the site form and there is no indication of further
investigations at the site.

site 41uv84
Site 41UV84 is located east of RR 1051 at the confluence
of the Dry Frio River and an unnamed tributary, 1.85 miles
north of RR 1051’s fifth crossing of the Dry Frio River. The
site is recorded as an area of scattered hearths and burned
rock with no mention of lithics being present. There is no
indication of further investigations at the site.

site 41uv86

site 41uv446

Site 41UV86, also known as the Heard Schoolhouse Site,
is located along RR 1051 on the south bank of Mine Creek,
0.4 mile south of RR 1051’s sixth crossing of the Dry Frio
River. The site was originally recorded as the location of
two burned rock middens, one of which had been severely
disturbed by bulldozing activity and the other located out­
side the RR 1051 ROW. Further investigations determined
that the midden outside the ROW is likely not a prehistoric
feature (Black et al. 1997). Excavations conducted in 1982
and 1983 determined that site 41UV86 is a prehistoric open
campsite utilized periodically from the late Paleoindian
time period to the Late Prehistoric with the recovered data
suggesting that the site was intensively occupied during the
Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric (Black et al. 1997).
All excavations were conducted exclusively within the
RR 1051 ROW.

Site 41UV446 is located along RR 1051, approximately
1 mile north of its intersection with U.S. 83. The site was
recorded by SWCA in 2005 after being exposed by con­
struction for improvements to RR 1051. The site is a burned
rock midden that was exposed under a thin layer of grass
and overburden just west of the roadway. A Pedernales point
and several pieces of lithic debitage were recovered in as­
sociation with the midden. However, the survey determined
that the portion of the midden within the RR 1051 ROW
has been severely disturbed by construction associated with
the roadway (Chavez and Lawrence 2005). The midden
likely extends west of the ROW where further investiga­
tion is needed to determine the integrity of the midden and
associated deposits, beyond the current APE.

site 41uv87

Site 41UV371 was initially recorded as a prehistoric site
consisting of two burned rock middens from notes and
maps from the 1930s by William Vane Huskey (Decker et
al. 2000). The reevaluation of RR 1051 by SWCA in 2005
observed disturbed cultural material within the ROW. The
cultural material consisted of a diffuse surficial scatter of
lithics and burned rock in secondary context due to con­
struction associated with the roadway. The location of the
cultural material was directly adjacent to the location of
previously recorded site 41UV371 and therefore the site
boundaries were modified to include the portion of the
ROW containing the material. The 2005 SWCA investiga­
tions determined that the site is a disturbed surficial scatter
of cultural material with little to no research value within
the ROW due to the extensive disturbances (Chavez and
Lawrence 2005).

Site 41UV87 is located on the north bank of Mine Creek,
across from site 41UV86. The site is recorded as a large
area of scattered burned rock and flakes on a small ridge
between an erosional cut and the creek (Site Form). The
site is mapped as being predominantly east of the current
RR 1051 ROW. No features or middens are noted on the
site form and there is no indication of further investigations.

site 41uv88
Site 41UV88, the Woodrow Heard Site, is located on a
large terrace of the Dry Frio River, just north of RR 1051’s
sixth crossing of the Dry Frio River. The site was originally
recorded as a large area of burned rock middens, scattered
hearths, and flakes. Excavations at the site in the early 1980s
determined that 41UV88 is an intermittent prehistoric oc­
cupation site occupied from the Paleoindian period trough
the Late Prehistoric (Decker et al. 2000). These excavations
concentrated on the Late Archaic occupation in an attempt
to obtain more information on “one of the least well un­
derstood periods in the region’s prehistory” (Decker et al.
2000:1). The investigations overall determined that the site
represents mixed-age deposits of repeated and intensive
occupations on a long-stable surface (Decker et al. 2000).
All excavations took place exclusively within the RR 1051
ROW.

site 41uv363
Site 41UV363 is located north of the fifth crossing of the
Dry Frio River by RR 1051, just east of Reagan Wells,
Texas. There is no additional information besides the gen­
eral location of the site.

site 41uv371

site 41uv447
Site 41UV447 is located approximately 2 miles north of
the U.S. 83 and 200 m south of the Aldine Cemetery. The
site was first noticed during construction along RR 1051 in
2005 when a cluster of burned rock was encountered dur­
ing brush clearing and grading along the western portion
of the ROW. Subsequent investigations by SWCA deter­
mined that the construction had displaced a large portion
(approximately 80 percent) of a small burned rock feature
and a small amount of lithic material over a 50 m area. The
less than 1-m-wide portion (approximately 20 percent) of
the feature that remained along the extreme western part
of the ROW was investigated and found to contain a few
burned rocks with no charcoal staining or additional arti­
facts. Therefore, the 2005 investigations determined that no
additional information could be recovered from the feature
based on the disturbances within the ROW (Chavez and

Lawrence 2005).

site 41uv446
Site 41UV446 is a burned rock midden that was relocated
on a small rise just south of a small-unnamed drainage
leading into the Dry Frio River. The previous investigation
utilized three trenches and three shovel tests to determine
the condition of the midden within the RR 1051 ROW.
These previous investigations determined that the midden
has been incised by the RR 1051 road cut to the east and
occupies a narrow intact portion of the small rise along the
western portion of the ROW. The site likely extends further
west beyond the ROW boundary onto private property.

Canyon-Reagan Wells route.

results of survey
For the sake of this narrative, the Frio Canyon-Reagan Wells
route has been broken up into three sections. Section 1 is the
portion of the route that follows U.S. 83, Section 2 is the 5
mile previously surveyed portion of RR 1051, and Section
3 is the approximately 13 mile northern section of RR 1051.

section 1
Overall, Section 1 predominantly traverses a high limestone
ridge that separates the Frio River and the Dry Frio River
valleys (Figure 7.5). This section consists of several cutand-fill segments throughout the U.S. 83 ROW and has high
relief topography along the western and eastern sides of the
Silver Mine Pass. Areas with minimal construction distur­
bances displayed extremely shallow soils and gravels with
exposed bedrock. No shovel tests were conducted within
Section 1 due to the shallow soils and extensive disturbances
from roadway construction within the ROW. No cultural
material was encountered throughout the investigated por­
tions of Section 1.

The narrow portion of the rise containing the midden has
been severely disturbed by previous road construction and
a previously installed telephone line. The proposed HCTC
telecommunication cable will parallel the existing line along
the western side of the RR 1051 ROW.
The revisit of site 41UV446 during the survey of Frio
Canyon-Reagan Wells route documented no new informa­
tion about site 41UV446 within the existing ROW. The
site appears to generally be in the same condition as it was
when it was documented in 2005. Overall, the integrity of
the site within the RR 1051 ROW has been impacted by
the roadway construction and maintenance as well as the
installation of a communications cable. As such, the portion
of site 41UV446 that extends into the project APE has little
to no research value and remains ineligible for designation
as an SAL. Should construction activities propose to impact
portions of the site beyond the ROW boundary, then ad­
ditional archaeological survey efforts may be warranted to
determine the significance of the intact portions of the site.

site 41uv447
Site 41UV447 is located approximately 2 miles north of the
U.S. 83 intersection along the western portion of the ROW.
The site was first recorded in 2005 when brush clearing for

section 2
Section 2 was previously surveyed by TxDOT in 2004 and
SWCA in 2005. The TxDOT survey covered the entire 5
miles of Section 2 while the SWCA survey reevaluated 2.25
miles of the original survey. The area reevaluated by SWCA
in 2005 displayed extensive disturbances throughout the
ROW from recent roadway expansion construction (Figures
7.6). Due to these disturbances, the current investigations
concentrated on relocating the three previously recorded
sites that are located adjacent to the project APE (41UV371,
41UV446, and 41UV447). No evidence of site 41UV371
was encountered within the project APE, and as such the site
does not stand to be impacted by the proposed undertaking.

road construction encountered a cluster of burned rock and
a sparse lithic scatter.
The previous investigations at the site included the place­
ment of two trenches and two shovel tests within the site
boundaries, as well as a trench north of the site to determine
the extent of the cultural materials. The previous investiga­
tions also included exposing the in situ portion of the feature
to determine its integrity. None of the trenches encountered
cultural materials, and it was determined that the artifacts
are limited to the disturbed materials observed on the sur­
face and a narrow intact portion of a burned rock feature.
From the previous investigations, it was determined that no
other information could be recovered based on the disturbed
nature of over 80 percent of the feature. Additionally, the site
was determined to have little to no research value because
of the disturbances within the ROW.
The current investigations relocated a sparse scatter of
burned rock with no signs of any intact portions within the
ROW. Therefore, the current investigation concurs with the
2005 investigations, and the portion of site 41UV447 that
extends into the project APE will not be adversely impacted
by the current undertaking.

section 3
The 13.2 miles of RR 1051 that make up Section 3 parallel
the Dry Frio River to the northern end of the public ac­
cess portion of the road. The field survey within Section 3
encountered predominately limestone gravel deposits and
shallow soils over limestone bedrock. Ground visibility
throughout the route was greater than 70 percent, and only
isolated portions of the section displayed a potential for
buried cultural materials. Because of the high degree of
ground visibility and the general lack of soil deposition,
48 shovel tests were conducted.
The route crosses several drainages and the Dry Frio River
five times within Section 3. These waterway crossings dis­
play gravel and cobble deposits indicative of high energy
flood events. Shovel tests in these locations contained little
to no depositional soils. A few isolated locations within
the inside bend of large meanders displayed fine grain
depositional soils; however, shovel tests in these locations
encountered shallow deposits with no cultural material.
All encountered cultural material was confined to surface
contexts.
Overall, two new archaeological sites (41UV476 and
41UV477) were recorded within Section 3 and seven
previously recorded sites (41UV83 through 41UV88, and
41UV363) were revisited within the HCTC APE. Of the
seven previously recorded sites within the APE, the survey
was unable to relocate or find evidence of sites 41UV84,
41UV85, 41UV88, or 41UV363 within the project APE.

site 41uv476
Site 41UV476 is located within the western ROW of
RR 1051 on the northern side of the Dry Frio River ap­
proximately 4 miles north of the RR 1051 and U.S. 83
intersection. The site is a sparse surficial lithic scatter (ap­
proximately five flakes) that likely extends south beyond
the ROW boundary along the Dry Frio River. The portion
of the site that extends into the APE appears disturbed
by roadway construction and maintenance. In addition,
exposed bedrock and the overall upland topography of the
area suggest no subsurface deposits within the site. A small
isolated area within the site along the APE displayed the
possibility of deeper soils and was investigated with a single
shovel test. However, the test encountered shallow sandy
loams over bedrock. Due to the scarcity of materials and
disturbances by roadway construction and maintenance, the
site is considered to have poor integrity and is unlikely to
provide new or unique information to the archaeological
record. Therefore, the site has little to no research value
within the project APE.

site 41uv477
Site 41UV477 is located within the current RR 1051 ROW,
just south of the fourth crossing of the Dry Frio River. The
site is a sparse surficial lithic scatter (approximately 10
flakes) isolated to the eastern portion of the RR 1051 ROW.
The circular site extends 40 x 40 m on a small rise 550 feet
south of the river channel. The rise overlooks a terrace of
the Dry Frio River, which meanders west just north of the
site location. The rise is an extension of a rounded hill to
the east that ascends approximately 120 feet above the
site and approximately 165 feet above the Dry Frio River.
The surface of the rise is dominated by surficial limestone
cobbles and pebbles. Two shovel tests excavated at site
41UV476 encountered shallow sandy clay loams with large
amounts of gravels over limestone bedrock. Disturbances to
the site were similar to 41UV77 with evidence of roadway
construction and maintenance. No diagnostic artifacts or
intact cultural features were encountered within the site
boundaries. The site is considered to have poor integrity
and is unlikely to provide new or unique information to the
archaeological record, based on the scarcity of materials
and disturbances as a result of roadway construction and
maintenance. Therefore, the site has little to no research
value within the HCTC APE.

site 41uv83
The previously recorded site 41UV83 is located just north
of Reagan Wells within the ROW of RR 1051. The site
was revisited during the survey of the Frio Canyon-Reagan
Wells route and documented a sparse surficial scatter of
non-diagnostic lithic debris within the western portion of
the RR 1051 ROW. However, no cultural materials were

Survey Results for Zone 4
observed within the actual project APE, which runs along
the eastern ROW of RR 1051.
Although the entire ROW appears disturbed in the vicin­
ity of site 41UV83, the eastern portion of the ROW has
been heavily impacted as a drainage swale and fill section
dominated the entirely of the ROW. Within the APE, shal­
low soils and surficial cobbles negated the need to excavate
shovel tests within the site boundary. Due to disturbances
from roadway construction and all cultural material being
isolated to the eastern side of the ROW, opposite the APE,
the site does not stand to be impacted by the proposed
undertaking.

site 41uv86
Site 41UV86, also known as the Heard Schoolhouse Site,
has been highly disturbed by construction associated with
RR 1051. A sparse scatter of lithic debitage was observed
on the surface throughout the area. However, three shovel
tests excavated within the APE along the eastern portion
of the ROW, encountered extremely shallow loams over
bedrock with no cultural material. No diagnostic artifacts or
intact features were noted within the known site boundaries.
Extensive previous investigations and the current disturbed
nature of the site suggest that the site has poor integrity and
is unlikely to provide new information to the archaeologi­
cal record. Therefore, the site has little to no research value
within the HCTC APE.

site 41uv87
Site 41UV87 is in a similar condition as site 41UV86.
The site, located on the north bank of Mine Creek across
from site 41UV86, consists of a very sparse scatter of
non-diagnostic lithic artifacts within the APE. The current
roadway has leveled the original topography of the site
and subsequent maintenance appears to have disturbed the
surficial deposits within the site. Three shallow shovel tests
performed within the APE at the site did not encounter any
subsurface cultural material. Therefore, due to roadway
disturbances and the overall scarcity of materials, the site
has little to no research value within the HCTC APE.

projeCt settIng
The majority of the Tarpley Route 4F is located along FM
470, west of Tarpley, Texas in southern Bandera County
(Figure 7.7). Only small portions (totaling 1.1 miles) of the
route that traverse private property were excluded from the
archaeological survey.

81

The majority of the APE is within the FM 470 ROW. The
route runs along FM 470 from its intersection with RM 187
in Tarpley to approximately 7.5 mile west, just past Chili
Canyon Road. Shorter segments along Rio Hondo Road and
Williams Creek Road run north of FM 470, near the western
and eastern extent of the project area. Williams Creek Road
runs north from Tarpley for approximately 1.5 miles. For
the most part, the line closely parallels existing fence lines
along the outer edges of the highway ROW.
Ground visibility was almost always greater than 70 per­
cent. The field survey consisted of intermittent shovel test
excavations and ground inspection based upon the local
characteristics and distribution of known archaeological
sites as well as shallow soils and frequent outcrops of
bedrock. All shovel tests were in the public ROW and
were excavated on a judgmental basis determined by the
likelihood of depositional soils. There were no areas where
backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths did
not exceed 70 cm.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that a previous sur­
vey of FM 470 within the current APE was conducted by
TxDOT in 2007 (TxDOT 2007). The survey consisted of
3.6 miles of the current FM 470 ROW from RM 187 in
Tarpley, west to near the Hondo Creek crossing. The sur­
vey consisted of a pedestrian survey with shovel testing
along high potential areas and a vehicular reconnaissance
survey in the disturbed and upland low probability areas.
The survey determined that the majority of the project area
is disturbed by previous highway and utility construction
(TxDOT 2007). In all, five shallow shovel tests were per­
formed and no cultural material was encountered.
No previously recorded sites are located within the project
area. A total of three sites (41BN7, 41BN11, and 41BN20)
are mapped adjacent to, or within 100 m, of the alignment.
Site 41BN7 is located approximately 1,300 feet north of FM
470 and 5 miles west of Tarpley. The site is the location of
two surficial middens with a wide scatter of lithic debitage
and burned rock. The middens are located on a large flat
area about 75 feet from Pigeon Roost Creek. No recom­
mendations were available regarding further archaeological
investigations as well as status for formal SAL designation
or for listing in the NRHP.
Site 41BN20 is located approximately 1,000 feet west of
Rio Hondo Road, near the confluence of Hondo Creek and a
spring fed tributary of Hondo Creek. The site is described as
a prehistoric campsite with a small surficial scatter of lithic
debitage including a flaked tool and two cores. No recom­
mendations were available regarding further archaeological
investigations as well as status for formal SAL designation
or for listing in the NRHP.

Survey Results for Zone 4
Site 41BN11 is a located approximately 400 feet further
west of site 41BN20, near Rio Hondo Road. The site is
described a large prehistoric burned rock midden and camp­
site consisting of a surficial lithic scatter and two projectile
points. The documented diagnostic Frio point suggests a
Late to Transitional Archaic occupation. The midden is
described as 60 feet in diameter and 4 feet high. As with
site 41BN20, no recommendations were available regarding
further archaeological investigations as well as status for
formal SAL designation or for listing in the NRHP.

results of survey
The investigations consisted of two survey methods, inten­
sive survey and reconnaissance survey. Intensive survey
involved an examination of the ground surface and excava­
tion of shovel tests. In addition to drainage locales or other
areas with soils, shovel tests were also excavated in areas
of lower ground visibility. The reconnaissance survey areas
were along the heavily disturbed and upland portions of FM
470, Rio Hondo Road, and Rio Hondo Loop. The western
portion of the APE consisted of stairstep topography and
exposed bedrock (Figure 7.8). In addition, the majority of
FM 470 appeared disturbed by recent road improvement
and construction. Although most of FM 470 was disturbed,
shovel tests were excavated in areas that appeared to contain
soils. In all, a total of 38 shovel tests were excavated.
The soils encountered throughout the project APE can be
sorted into three basic groups. The eastern soils consisted of
deeper soil and gravel deposits of alluvium likely associated
with Williams Creek. Shovel tests in this area encountered
isolated deeper silty clay alluvium with varying amounts
of gravels and shallow gravel deposits. The few areas of
deeper alluvium extended to a maximum observed depth
of 70 cmbs. Continuing west of Williams Creek towards
Hondo Creek, the survey encountered soils within the APE
that consisted of shallow to moderately deep soils. These

83

soils consisted of alternating shallow gravel deposits and
deeper compacted clays. The gravels appear to be alluvium
in association with high energy flood deposits related to the
adjacent Hondo Creek. The final group of soils dominated
the area west of Hondo Creek, which consisted of extremely
shallow soils and areas of exposed bedrock. The APE in
this area typically traversed steep to sloping uplands with
several cut and fill sections throughout the FM 470 roadway.
A minimal amount of shovel testing was conducted in this
area with subsurface investigations isolated to drainage
crossings, namely the Pigeon Roost Creek crossing.
Evidence of recent road construction and maintenance has
disturbed the length of FM 470 within the project area.
These disturbances include grading along both sides of
the roadway to the ROW boundary, and the excavation of
shallow drainages running parallel to both sides of the road.
Although these disturbances were apparent on the surface,
shovel tests were still performed in areas that appeared to
contain deeper soils. Unfortunately, the excavated shovel
tests in this area did not reach depths greater than 25 cm be­
fore encountering bedrock or bedrock deposits. None of the
shovel tests along FM 470 encountered cultural materials.
In all, the survey documented one new prehistoric archaeo­
logical site (41BN213) adjacent to Williams Creek in the
Williams Creek Road ROW. Additionally, the areas within
the APE near the three previously recorded sites (41BN7,
41BN11, and 41BN20) were also intensively inspected to
determine if any evidence of these sites stand to be impacted
by the proposed undertaking.
The APE nearest the plotted positions of previously re­
corded sites 41BN7, 41BN11, and 41BN20 were inten­
sively inspected. No artifacts were observed in the APE,
nor were artifacts observed across the fence line at any of
these locations. The current project will have no effect on
these sites, as there was no evidence the sites extend into
the current project APE.

site 41bn213

Figure 7.8.

Overview of exposed limestone in road
cut along Tarpley Route 4F.

Site 41BN213 is located within the existing Williams Creek
Road ROW, approximately 0.3 mile north-northwest of the
intersection of Williams Creek Road and FM 470 (Figure
7.9). The site is situated adjacent to the eastern side of
Williams Creek Road, which runs parallel and adjacent to
a west flowing meander of Williams Creek. The site was
recognized by a discrete concentration of burned rock and
lithic material exposed in a shallow road cut along the nar­
row eastern ROW of Williams Creek Road (Figure 7.10).
The dimensions of the site within the Williams Creek Road
ROW extend 40 m (north-south) by 3 m (east-west). How­
ever, the site likely extends beyond the ROW boundary
towards the east in a rather flat maintained yard. Observed
artifacts include tertiary and secondary flakes as well as a

NRHP eligibility status of site 41BN213 is undetermined
based on the high probability for additional intact, buried
archaeological deposits on the site. SWCA recommends
that the site be avoided until additional testing investiga­
tions can be initiated. As the project sponsors have adopted
a complete avoidance policy regarding cultural resources
within the APE, the site will be bored under the extent of
the deposits to a depth greater than 150 cm (5 feet).

projeCt settIng
The Leakey North routes total 22.82 miles and are located in
central Real County, around the small town of Leakey, Texas
(Figure 7.11). The Leakey North routes consist of Routes
3F, 5F, 7F, 8F, 8F-28, and 11F. Route 3F was not surveyed
under the current investigations because the entirety of the
route was previously surveyed for cultural resources in

Chapter 7

2006 by SWCA (Houk and Carpenter 2007). The remain­
ing routes are located north and west of Leakey along RM
336, Owl Hollow and Cedar Creek Road, and RM 337, and
to the southwest of town along Walter White Ranch Road.
Route 5F runs along Walter White Ranch Road for approxi­
mately 2.16 miles, from the Pendley Road intersection to
the west end of the county road, where it continues north
onto private property.
Route 7F parallels RM 337 (Patterson Creek Road) for a
distance of approximately 3.52 miles, where it crosses onto
private property to the north. The proposed line traverses
a high upland ridge then reenters the public ROW for an
additional 0.4 mile before it terminates at Old Reagan
Wells Road.
Route 8F begins at the intersection of RM 336 and U.S.
83 and continues north along RM 336 for approximately
6.5 miles.
Route 8F-28 runs west along Cedar Creek Road from its
intersection with RM 337 for approximately 3.1 miles.
Finally, Route 11F follows the West Frio River along Old
Rocksprings and Prade Ranch Road for a distance of ap­
proximately 4 miles.
Because the Leakey North routes were all located in close
proximity to the West Frio River or one of tributary drain­
ages, investigators conducted a 100 percent intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey on all portions of the pro­
posed alignment located within the accessible public ROW.
Ground visibility was typically greater than 50 percent over
the majority of the project area. The survey predominantly
encountered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bedrock.
There were no areas where backhoe trenching was needed
as observed soil depths seldom exceeded 50–60 cm within
the project area.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that one archaeologi­
cal survey has been conducted within the Leakey North
routes. In 2006, SWCA archaeologists conducted cultural
resource investigations for TxDOT along RM 337 from
U.S. 83 to 5.58 miles east of U.S. 83 (Houk and Carpenter
2007). This survey covered approximately 40.6 acres of
ROW. One prehistoric archaeological site (41RE106) was
recorded as a result of the survey. Route 3F falls entirely
within the area previously surveyed, therefore, no further
investigation was conducted along this route as a part of
the current investigations.
No previously recorded sites are recorded within any of the
Leakey North routes. However, seven previously recorded
prehistoric open campsites are within 1 mile of the various

alignments (41RE5, 41RE8, 41RE9, 41RE10, 41RE48,
41RE106, and 41RE120).
In addition, one historical marker is located near the project
area along Route 8F, on the opposite side of RM 336. This
marker was erected in 1968 at the site of the McLaurin
Massacre. On April 19, 1881, Lipan Apaches raided the
McLaurin home resulting in the deaths of Catherine McLau­
rin and 14-year-old Allen Lease. Neighbors gave chase for
70 miles, at which time soldiers from Fort Clark took over
and followed the party into Mexico, killing all but two. This
marked the last Indian raid in the Frio River Valley (Atlas).

results of survey
route 5f
Route 5F is the southernmost of the Leakey North routes
and parallels the north side of Walter White Ranch Road
for most of its length before terminating on private prop­
erty (Circle H Ranch). The vast majority of Route 5F is
characterized by disturbed ROW and shallow, rocky soil
over limestone bedrock. Flat Creek and one of its tributary
drainages cross the project area, but have no deep soil
deposited along their margins. Shovel tests in these areas
encountered bedrock at depths of 5–20 cmbs. Surface vis­
ibility was generally around 70 percent throughout Route
5F, and dropped to approximately 30 percent through short,
maintained grass that thickened near the creek crossings.
A total of 20 shovel tests was excavated along the portion
of Route 5F within the public ROW and all were negative
for cultural material. No previously recorded sites were
located within the Route 5F project area and no new sites
were recorded as a result of the current investigation.

route 7f
Route 7F runs for 4.81 miles east to west along RM 337,
beginning at the intersection of Mountain Street and ending
just south of Old Reagan Wells Road. A total of 25 shovel
tests was excavated along Route 7F, all of which were
negative for cultural material. The maximum depth reached
was between 25–30 cmbs in shovel tests near the crossings
of two unnamed Patterson Creek drainages, east of John
Buchanan Road. Elsewhere throughout the route, typical
upland soils were encountered with exposed bedrock at the
surface or 5–10 cm of shallow, gravelly clay above bedrock.
Much of the area was disturbed due to prior road construc­
tion and maintenance, especially along the eastern portion
of the route, where much of the roadside was graded and
developed with commercial properties. The introduction of
the roadway has channelized run-off in some portions of
the ROW, intensifying the effects of sheet erosion on the
thin soils, and exposing shallow limestone bedrock. No
prehistoric or historic cultural materials were documented
along Route 7F.

Survey Results for Zone 4

route 8f
Route 8F parallels RM 336 and traverses a combination of
high terraces, low flood plains of the West Frio River, and
steep rocky side slopes. Surface visibility along Route 8F
ranged between 30–100 percent, and disturbance within
the APE consisted of occasional transmission line poles,
buried utilities, road cuts, and surface grading. As was the
case along the majority of the other Leakey North routes,
outcrops of limestone bedrock were frequently encountered.
On the south side of Cedar Creek, the road cut exposes
the soil profile, with developed soil atop buried alluvial
deposits on an ancient terrace. Throughout the majority of
the project area, shovel tests typically encountered thick
clay, impenetrable gravel, or limestone bedrock at depths
of 20–40 cmbs, however, deeper soils were present on the
wide terrace (Quaternary deposits) between Cedar Creek
and the base of the steep hills to the north. Shovel tests
through this portion of the project area generally terminated
at basal clay or impenetrable gravels at depths of 50–85
cmbs. At the north edge of this area, six shovel tests were
positive for prehistoric debitage and burned rock between
5–65 cmbs, resulting in the documentation of site 41RE128.
In the area of the site location and to the north, soils become
shallow and rocky again, continuing for the remainder of the
Route 8F project area. In all, a total of 54 shovel tests was
excavated within the APE of Route 8F, six of which were
positive for cultural material. No other cultural materials
were found along proposed Route 8F.

site 41re128
Site 41RE128 is located on a low knoll that extends to the
west of RM 336 along Route 8F. The general area is along
the margin of a Pleistocene terrace approximately 200 m
from of the West Frio River. Although the Geologic Atlas
of Texas (Barnes 1983) indicates that alluvium here pre­
dates human occupation, frequent flooding of the river has
produced enough sediment deposition to shallowly bury
the site. While artifacts were found as shallow as 5 cmbs,
no artifacts were visible on the surface within the project
area. A total of seven shovel tests was used to delineate
the site boundaries within the APE, six of which contained
buried cultural material to a maximum depth of 65 cmbs.
Site 41RE128 measures approximately 100 m northeastsouthwest by 4 m northwest-southeast, and is essentially
limited to the low knoll within the public ROW. Artifacts
included mostly tertiary chert flakes with fire-cracked rock
and indeterminate chert shatter (produced either by inten­
tional flaking during tool production, thermal fracturing due
to heat exposure, or altered by both). One broken bifacial
tool was also recovered from a shovel test at approximately
20 cmbs.

87

The highest concentration of artifacts was found directly
above dense gravel layer, within the lower portion of grav­
elly, silty clay as it transitions to silty gravel. Other than the
observed pattern in artifact density, there is no discernable
stratification within the deposit, nor were any intact features
encountered. The easternmost edge of the knoll was likely
truncated by RM 336 and the shallow drainage ditch that
parallels the edge of the roadway. A faint depression is also
visible along the ROW fence line, potentially indicating that
buried utilities have been routed through the site within the
APE. Vegetation on the site consists of short, maintained
grass, prickly pear cacti, and a few small, scattered trees
and shrubs along the ROW fence line, which allowed for
approximately 40 percent surface visibility. Site 41RE128
likely represents an open campsite, with the potential for
significant deposits and features that could contribute to
the archaeological understanding of prehistoric occupa­
tion in the region. However, the portion of the site within
the APE site has little to no research value due to a high
level of disturbance from roadway construction and utili­
ties routing. Although site 41RE128 does meet the criteria
for designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26.12, the
proposed APE closely follows the existing buried utilities
in this area and will not impact potentially intact portions
of the site. Accordingly, no further work is recommended
in the HCTC APE at site 41RE128.

route 8f-28
Route 8F-28 spurs off of Route 8F and follows Cedar
Creek Road to the west for a distance of approximately
3.1 miles, crossing Cedar Creek multiple times along the
way. Because Route 8F-28 is entirely within or very near
the heavily eroded stream channel, virtually no soil was
present within the APE. Typically, the surface was covered
with limestone gravels, cobbles, and boulders and did not
have the potential to contain intact, buried cultural material.
A total of 12 shovel tests was excavated along the route, all
of which were negative for cultural material. No previously
recorded sites were present within the proposed project
area and no new sites were recorded along Route 8F-28 as
a result of the current investigation.

route 11f
Route 11F is the northernmost of the Leakey North routes
and mostly falls within the low-lying valley of the West Frio
River. The proposed route meanders across the river and
other large creeks several times and the majority of the area
is extremely rocky with shallow to no soils due to frequent
flooding. A total of 12 shovel tests was excavated along
Route 11F, all of which were negative for cultural material.
No previously recorded sites were located within the APE
and no cultural material or historical features were observed
as a result of the current investigation along Route 11F.

projeCt settIng
The majority of the Tarpley routes are located along RM
462 and CR 211 south of Tarpley, Texas in southern Ban­
dera County and northern Medina County (Figure 7.12).
The majority of the routes were surveyed or evaluated and
only several short segments were excluded (totaling 3.05
miles) as they are located on private property.
Route 2F runs along RM 462 and eventually turns west
along CR 211 and terminates just east of the entrance to the
Run ‘n Hide Ranch. All but a short stretch of the CR 211
section is in the southern part of the ROW.
Route 2F-8 travels west from RM 462, crossing Hondo
Creek and then paralleling Ross Road. Most of this route
is in the public ROW, beginning just west of Hondo Creek
and continuing for roughly 1.5 miles, ending just west of
Hondo Oaks Drive.
Shorter segments along Williams Creek Road (Route 4F­
1-5) and Thomas Creek Road (Route 5F) run north of FM
470, along the respective drainages for which the roads are
named. Roughly one-eighth of the Williams Creek Road
route is in the public ROW, including a segment adjacent
to previously recorded site 41BN104. Approximately 40
percent of the Thomas Creek Road route is in the public
ROW, mainly at the northern end of the route. For the most
part, the line closely parallels existing fence lines along the
outer edges of the highway ROW.
Route 10F-4 is a very small segment within the town limits
of Tarpley. The line is on the north side of FM 470, and
crosses Kyle Ranch Road. This roughly 300-foot-long seg­
ment has been extensively impacted by road construction
and buildings, and was assessed visually.
Ground visibility ranged from 20–100 percent throughout
the Tarpley routes, and was almost always greater than 70
percent. The field survey consisted of intermittent shovel
test excavations and ground inspection based upon the
local characteristics and distribution of known archaeo­
logical sites as well as shallow soils and frequent outcrops
of bedrock. All shovel tests were in the public ROW and
were excavated on a judgmental basis determined by the
likelihood of depositional soils. There were no areas where
backhoe trenching was needed as observed soil depths did
not exceed 70 cm.

BaCkground revIew fIndIngs
The background review determined that none of the Tarpley
routes have been previously surveyed for cultural resources.
Additionally, no previously recorded archaeological sites
are mapped within the project APE.
Site 41BN104 is located directly northeast of Williams
Creek Road and 2.1 miles northwest of Tarpley. The site,
known as the Gunsight Mound, is a large, above ground
burned rock midden and presumed open campsite. The
midden is located on a large flat area about 60 m west
of Williams Creek, near the confluence of an unnamed
spring-fed tributary. The site was originally recorded at an
unknown date by C. K. Chandler; with additional investi­
gations conducted by the Archeological Conservancy. The
site size depicted on the Atlas measures approximately 200
m northwest-southeast by 110 m northeast-southwest, and
is not shown to extend to the edge of the road. No recom­
mendations were available regarding status for formal SAL
designation or for listing in the NRHP, however the site
was recommended for avoidance and protective measures.

results of survey
Shovel testing investigations were conducted intermittently
due to the prevalence of exposed bedrock and high surface
visibility throughout much of the Tarpley routes. In all,
a total of 118 shovel tests was excavated and most were
concentrated around the various drainage crossings and in
the less disturbed areas.
The soils encountered throughout the project APE can be
sorted into three basic groups. The soils along Williams
Creek and portions of Hondo Creek consisted of deeper
soil and gravel deposits of alluvium. Shovel tests in this
area encountered isolated, deep silty clay alluvium with
varying amounts of gravels and shallow gravel deposits.
The few areas of deeper alluvium extended to a maximum
observed depth of 60–70 cmbs. Some areas near Thomas
Creek and west of Hondo Creek contain soils within the
APE that are shallow to moderately deep. These soils consist
of alternating shallow gravel deposits and deeper compacted
calcareous clays. These soils appear to be a mixture of
creek alluvium and slope colluvium, with gravels originat­
ing from both sources. The final group of soils dominates
the uplands west of Hondo Creek and at the far northern
end of the project area, consisting of extremely shallow
soils and areas of exposed bedrock. The APE in this area
traverses steep to sloping uplands. A minimal amount of
shovel testing was conducted in this area with subsurface
investigations isolated to drainage crossings and occasional
colluvial benches (Figure 7.13).
Evidence of road construction and maintenance has dis­
turbed much of the project APE. Along the length of RM

materials. These shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials, and the flake is considered an isolated find.

462 disturbances include grading and fill sections along
both sides of the roadways, as well as concrete rip rap
and contouring of drainage crossings. Although these
disturbances were often apparent on the surface, shovel
tests were still performed in areas that appeared to contain
deeper soils below the rather shallow disturbances. Unfor­
tunately, the excavated shovel tests in this area did not reach
depths greater than 35 cm before encountering bedrock or
compact gravelly clay, and many encountered construction
fill. None of the shovel tests along RM 462 encountered
cultural materials.
Grading of dirt and caliche roads in upland areas has also
disturbed portions of the APE. Along CR 211 and Thomas
Creek Road, gravel and dirt push piles extended as much as
a meter from the edge of the roadway in the shallow rocky
areas. Grading in areas with soil deposition has resulted in
cut sections that range from 10–40 cmbs and sometimes
extend to the edge of the ROW. Cultural resources in these
areas would be located at or near the surface, so these dis­
turbances would have a severe impact.
The APE near previously recorded site 41BN104 was in­
tensively surveyed, revealing that the site extends into the
project area. The survey also recorded one new prehistoric
archaeological site (41ME209) in the CR 211 ROW. In addi­
tion to these two sites, a number of isolated non-diagnostic
chert tools and flakes were observed on the surface across
the project area. In every instance, the APE was thoroughly
inspected for additional artifacts, and a shovel test was
excavated in areas with potential for subsurface deposits.
When no additional artifacts were recovered, the find was
noted as an isolated occurrence. A shovel test east of Hondo
Creek along CR 211 encountered a chert flake at 35 cmbs.
Six additional shovel tests were excavated to the east and
west within the APE in an effort to locate additional cultural

This site, known as the Gunsight Mound, is most notable by
the presence of a large burned rock midden (Figure 7.14).
This roughly 6-foot-high mound, while covered in trees,
is highly visible from Williams Road and has been fenced
off to discourage looters. Area residents are well aware
and proud of the site, and are protective of it. The fenced
area extends for approximately 60 m along Williams Road,
and the APE passes between the road and the fenced-off
midden area. A plowed field is located to the west of the
site area, and the area to the north and east appears to have
been plowed in the past. The land slopes rapidly towards
Williams Creek south of the road. Scattered burned rock
and chert flakes are present on the surface of the APE along
the fenced area, demonstrating that the site extends to the
edge of the road. The APE was intensively investigated in
order to delineate the site boundaries, as well as to assess
the significance of the subsurface deposits. The plowed
fields suggest that the off-midden site deposits may have
been compromised by plowing, which would also account
for the surface artifacts in the ROW.
Six shovel tests were excavated across the 0.15-mile APE in
the vicinity of site 41BN104; including two along the fenced
area and one just to the west. The easternmost test was near
an unnamed tributary to Williams Creek, while the westernmost was by a slight erosional rill. All three tests near the
fenced-in area were positive for cultural material, as was
the test east of the site. The two tests furthest west did not
encounter cultural materials. As a result, the recorded site
boundaries are extended, and the extent of the site within
the APE has been established. Furthermore, both flakes
and burned rock were found in a layer of dense, compact
clay loam beneath a blocky, clay loam layer identified as a
plow zone that extends from 0–35 cmbs. This deeper layer
is believed to be intact, suggesting that intact site deposits
are present within the APE. The depth of these deposits is
unknown, as the extremely compact soil prevented deep
shovel testing.
Based on the presence of intact, buried cultural deposits as
well as the prominent burned rock midden, SAL eligibility
status of site 41BN104 is currently undetermined. Addi­
tional archaeological investigations are recommended to
fully evaluate the significance of the site, and the site is
recommended for avoidance. As the project sponsors have
adopted a complete avoidance policy regarding significant
cultural resources within the APE, HCTC has agreed to
avoid impacts to the site through directional boring under­
neath the site. As such, no further work is recommended
at site 41BN104.

41Me209
Site 41ME209 is located within the existing CR 211 ROW,
approximately 5 miles west of the intersection of CR 211
and RM 462. The small site is situated on an upland ridge
south of a prominent hill, and roughly 250 m east of a
minor intermittent drainage. The site consists of a diffuse
scatter of lithic material exposed on a rocky surface south
of the graded gravel CR 211 roadway. The dimensions of
the site within the CR 211 ROW extend 2 m north-south
by 8 m east-west. Visual inspection from the edge of the
public ROW to the south did not reveal additional debitage,
however small artifacts might be present that could not be
viewed from a distance. Observed artifacts within the public
ROW include tertiary and secondary flakes, thermal shatter,
a chert core fragment, and a flake end scraper fragment.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed. Limestone bedrock
gravels, cobbles, and boulders are present on the site sur­
face, as well as areas of exposed limestone bedrock. Only
a thin (less than 2 cm) veneer of soil is present in the site
area, therefore no shovel tests were excavated. The site is in
a heavily eroded landscape that has been severely impacted
by vegetation clearing, road construction, and maintenance.
Based on lack of potential for significant buried deposits
as well as the sparse, ubiquitous artifact assemblage, site
41ME209 does not warrant formal SAL designation. Fur­
thermore, the site does not warrant avoidance, as it has
already been heavily disturbed and lacks research value.
As such, no further work is recommended at site 41ME209.

zone 5
Zone 5 is located in Kerr County and is composed of four
routes that have been grouped into a single project area
(Table 8.1, Figure 8.1). The routes have a total length of ap­
proximately 7.21 miles and approximately 2.49 miles were
surveyed for cultural resources. The survey included the
excavation of 32 shovel tests as well as the documentation of
one new prehistoric lithic scatter (41KR685). The complete
interim reports for Zone 5 can be viewed in Appendix A.

projeCt settIng
The Ingram Hills and Ingram Exchange/Bear Paw routes
total 7.21 miles and are located in the north central part of
Kerr County, to the north and south of Ingram, Texas (Figure
8.2). The Ingram Hills routes consist of Routes 3F-9-2 and
11F, while the Ingram Exchange/Bear Paw routes consist
of Routes 5F and 5-52B (Figures 8.3 and 8.4).
The Ingram Hills routes are located along Ingram Hills Road
and Yavo Road. Route 3F-9-2 begins at the intersection
of SH 27 and Ingram Hills Road. From this intersection,
the proposed route follows the sinuous Ingram Hills Road
in a general northeasterly direction for a distance of 0.84
mile. Of this distance, 0.67 mile, was surveyed, while the
remaining 0.17 mile of the line would be overhead on ex­
isting poles. Route 11F is located along Yavo and Ingram
Hills roads between an existing substation and Butler Road.
However, only the portion of Route 11F between the sub­
station and Ingram Hills Road (0.25 mile) where the line
would be buried within the existing ROW was surveyed,
Table 8.1.

while the remaining 0.46 mile of the line would be overhead
on existing poles.
Route 5F parallels Terrell Street for a short distance before
crossing Old Ingram Loop and continuing along Indian
Creek Road. Route 5F then parallels Indian Creek Road
and eventually joins an existing overhead line. The route
reverts to an underground utility as it parallels Freedom
Trail Road and weaves in and out of the public ROW. The
route eventually switches to an overhead utility and termi­
nates approximately 1.4 miles south of the intersection of
Bear Creek Road and Primrose Street.
Route 5-52B parallels Sheppard Reese Road, to the north­
east of Bear Creek Road for a total distance of 1.3 miles.
Within the route, a large portion of the proposed APE is
located on private property beyond the limits of the public
ROW and/or is to be an existing aerial route with little to
no subsurface impacts.
Surface visibility was typically greater than 50 percent over
the majority of the project area. The field survey often en­
countered shallow soils and frequent outcrops of bedrock.
However, shovel test excavations were implemented on a
judgmental basis in the public ROW in areas that displayed
the possibility of deeper or intact soils. Holocene deposits
are limited within the project area and observed soil depths
seldom exceeded 30 cmbs. Based on these observations,
backhoe trenching was not necessary.

According to available data, one survey has been conducted
within the Ingram Hills project area. The THC conducted
a large aerial survey for the Texas Water Development
Board (TWDB) in 1971 that overlaps 0.29 mile of Route

41KR85, 41KR86, and 41KR90). Two other archaeological
surveys have been conducted within a mile of the project
area. A linear survey was conducted by the TWDB and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the Ingram
Reservoir. Sites 41KR244 and 41KR245 were recorded
as a result of this survey and will be discussed below. The
final and most recent survey conducted within 1 mile of
the Ingram Hills project area was performed by LCRA in
2004. This survey was conducted prior to expansion of the
Ingram Substation approximately 0.68 mile southwest of
the current project area. Site 41KR620 was recorded as a
result of this project and will be discussed below.
Additionally, one historical marker is recorded 0.2 mile
northwest of the Ingram Hills project area. Historical
Marker 2436 for the Henderson Cemetery was erected in
1990 and reads,
“Howard Henderson (1842–1908) came to Texas in
1857. He was a survivor of the Civil War Battle of the
Nueces in 1862, in which he and other Unionists were
ambushed by a Confederate force near the Nueces
River. He later served as Texas Ranger. Henderson
married Narcissa Turknett in 1866 and they settled near
this site. In 1870, upon the deaths of their infant twin
sons Thomas and Philip, they began a family burial
ground which became known as Henderson Cemetery.
Other family members and neighbors were also buried
in the graveyard.”
ingraM exchange/bear PaW route
According to available data, one survey has been conducted
within the Ingram Exchange Bear/Paw project area. The
FHWA conducted survey investigations for a bridge re­
placement where Indian Creek Road crosses the Guadalupe
River. No sites were recorded in the area. Within 1 mile of
the Ingram Exchange Bear/Paw project area, another three

archaeological surveys have been conducted. In 1986, the
FHWA conducted an archaeological survey along SH 27
to the east of the northern project area terminus. No sites
were recorded near the current project area as a result of
this survey. To the northwest of the Ingram Exchange
Bear/Paw project area, the aforementioned linear survey
by the TWDB and EPA for the Ingram Reservoir recorded
sites 41KR244 and 41KR245 (discussed below). The final
survey conducted within 1 mile of the project area is the
aforementioned LCRA survey that was conducted prior to
expansion of the Ingram Substation (approximately 1,200
m north of the current project area) and that recorded site
41KR620 (discussed below).
Additionally, one cemetery is recorded along Bear Creek,
0.74 mile north of the Ingram Exchange/Bear Paw project
area. The Colbath Family Cemetery (KR-C012) was estab­
lished in 1927 and is a private cemetery with 12 marked
graves.
No previously recorded sites are located within or imme­
diately adjacent to the project area. However, a total of 21
previously recorded sites are mapped within 1 mile of the
Ingram Hills and Ingram Exchange/Bear Paw routes. These
sites consist of 15 prehistoric burned rock midden sites
(41KR4, 41KR5, 41KR19, 41KR20, 41KR30, 41KR31,
41KR32, 41KR33, 41KR80, 41KR81, 41KR82, 41KR85,
41KR86, 41KR91, and 41KR565), two lithic scatters
(41KR90 and 41KR620), three lithic procurement sites
(41KR6, 41KR244, and 41KR624), and one prehistoric
open campsite (41KR245).

route 3f-9-2
Overall, ground surface visibility is between 5 and 60
percent within the Route 3F-9-2 APE. The majority of

Survey Results for Zone 5 97
the route has shallow soils that are very often gravelly at
the surface. Some areas have exposed limestone bedrock
at the surface. The maximum shovel test depth reached
throughout Route 3F-9-2 was 50 cmbs with an average
sediment depth of approximately 30 cmbs. Most shovel
tests were terminated due to extremely dense and gravelly
clay. Disturbances within the ROW consisted of paved and
gravel driveways, existing utilities, drainage crossings and
culverts, and general highway construction and maintenance
activity. Vegetation within the APE consisted of short grass
that is often very thin due to a lack of soil, exposing dense
gravels and portions of limestone bedrock.
A total of 12 shovel tests was excavated along the ap­
proximately 0.67 mile of Route 3F-9-2 located within the
public ROW. Two of the 12 shovel tests were positive for
cultural material resulting in the identification of one new
archaeological site, 41KR685, located at Henderson Branch.

site 41kr685
Site 41KR685 is a sparse, shallowly-buried, lithic scatter
located on a terrace on the south side of Henderson Branch
within the public ROW immediately south of Ingram Hills
Road. A total of five shovel tests was used to delineate the
site boundaries within the APE, two of which contained
buried cultural material to a maximum depth of 20 cmbs.
The main concentration of artifacts was found to occur
between 10 and 20 cmbs. No cultural materials were iden­
tified on the surface. The site measures approximately 20
m east to west within the public ROW. Vegetation in the
site area consisted of short, maintained grasses and a few
scattered shrubs along the ROW fence, limiting surface
visibility to approximately 65 percent. Artifacts observed
in the positive shovel tests were two tertiary chert flakes.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed within the site. There
is no discernable stratification within the deposit, nor were
any intact features encountered.
The site has likely been disturbed by the construction of
Ingram Hills Road and ROW maintenance. Site 41KR685
likely represents a small prehistoric open campsite, and due
to the high level of disturbance within the APE, it exhibits
little potential for significant deposits and features that could
contribute to the archaeological understanding of prehistoric
occupation in the region. Accordingly, site 41KR685 is not
eligible for designation as an SAL and no further work is
recommended in the HCTC APE at site 41KR685.

route 11f
Route 11F parallels Yavo and Ingram Hills Roads, which
generally run east and then north in the steep uplands east
of Route 3F-9-2. Overall, ground surface visibility is be­
tween 50 and 75 percent within the Route 11F APE. The
majority of the route has shallow soils that are very often

gravelly at the surface. Some areas have exposed limestone
bedrock at the surface. The maximum shovel test depth
reached throughout Route 11F was 5 cmbs. The shovel
tests were terminated due to extremely dense and gravelly
clay. Disturbances within the ROW consisted of paved and
gravel driveways, existing utilities, drainage crossings and
culverts, and general highway construction and maintenance
activity. Vegetation within the APE consisted of short grass
that is often very thin due to a lack of soil, exposing dense
gravels and portions of limestone bedrock.
Two shovel tests were excavated along the approximately
0.25 mile of Route 11F located within the public ROW.
Neither shovel test was positive for cultural material. No
historic or prehistoric cultural resources were encountered
throughout the remainder of Route 11F.

route 5f
Route 5F has a total length of 4.36 miles and follows Ter­
rell Road, Indian Creek Road, and lastly Bear Creek Road.
Overall, ground surface visibility is between 5 and 75 per­
cent within the Route 5F APE. The majority of the route
has shallow soils that are very often gravelly at the surface.
Some areas have exposed limestone bedrock at the surface.
The maximum shovel test depth reached throughout Route
5F was 40 cmbs with an average sediment depth of ap­
proximately 19 cmbs. Most shovel tests were terminated at
bedrock. Disturbances within the ROW consisted of paved
and gravel driveways, existing utilities, drainage crossings
and culverts, and general highway construction and mainte­
nance activity. Vegetation within the APE consisted of short
grass that is often very thin due to a lack of soil, exposing
dense gravels and portions of limestone bedrock.
A total of 13 shovel tests was excavated along the approxi­
mately 1.24 miles of Route 5F located within the public
ROW. No shovel test was positive for cultural material. No
historic or prehistoric cultural resources were encountered
throughout the remainder of Route 5F.

route 5-52b
Route 5-52B parallels Sheppard Reese Road, which
generally runs east-west in the uplands east of Route 5F.
Overall, ground surface visibility is between 70 and 95
percent within the Route 5-52B APE. The majority of the
route has shallow soils that are very often gravelly at the
surface. Some areas have exposed limestone bedrock at the
surface. The maximum shovel test depth reached throughout
Route 5-52B was 40 cmbs with an average sediment depth
of approximately 25 cmbs. Disturbances within the ROW
consisted of paved and gravel driveways, existing utili­
ties, drainage crossings and culverts, and general highway
construction and maintenance activity. Vegetation within
the APE consisted of short grass that is often very thin due

to a lack of soil, exposing dense gravels and portions of
limestone bedrock.
Five shovel tests were excavated along the approximately
0.33 mile of Route 5-52B located within the public ROW.
None of the shovel tests were positive for cultural material.
No historic or prehistoric cultural resources were encoun­
tered throughout the remainder of Route 5-52B.

suMMary and reCoMMendatIons

On behalf of HCTC, SWCA conducted archaeological
surveys for the Zones 1–5 Fiber Project across 10 counties
in west-central Texas. The project includes the installation
of hundreds of miles of telecommunications cables and
spare ducts to be buried along various routes. The HCTC
Zones 1–5 project area comprises 78 individual routes and
roughly 335 miles. The investigations were conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The APE for
the project is 10 feet wide with a depth of impact of 3–4 feet.
The fiber optic cables will be installed within both publicowned (TxDOT, county, city) ROW, and private property.
Those sections of the proposed project area that traverse
private property were not surveyed for cultural resources.
The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
4952, with Kevin A. Miller serving as Principal Investigator.
The investigations included a background literature and
records review along with reconnaissance and intensive
pedestrian survey with systematic shovel test excavations.
Specifically, the THC stipulated that investigations focus
on the portions of the fiber alignments located within 500
meters of drainages that exhibited little to no disturbance
and contained soils.
Investigations covered 21 separate project areas grouped
into zones (Zones 1–5) based on their geographic locations.
Individual project areas varied from a few miles in length
to over 20 miles of proposed cable installation. The results
of the survey efforts from the individual project areas were
compiled into interim survey reports and were submitted
intermittently to the THC for review and interim clearance.
The full interim reports with detailed route descriptions, all
relevant maps, shovel test data, site discussions and plans,
photographs, and any other relevant graphics are included
on the attached CD (Appendix A).

Zone 1

Within Zone 1, SWCA surveyed 73.58 miles out of a total
length of approximately 105.66 miles over the course of
seven separate field visits. In all, 10 new archaeological
sites were documented and two previously recorded sites
were revisited. The newly recorded sites consist of eight
lithic scatters (41KE199, 41KE200, 41KE212, 41KE213,
41BN215, 41BN216, 41BN217, and 41BN219) and two

prehistoric open campsites (41KR686 and 41BN218). Evi­
dence of two previously recorded sites was also noted within
the project APE of Routes 1F and 3F of the Medina routes.
These sites are both prehistoric open campsites (41BN205
and 41BN5) and have been moderately to severely impacted
by roadway construction within the current project APE.

Zone 2
Zone 2 is composed of approximately 95 miles of telecom­
munications routes that traverse Gillespie, Mason, Menard,
and San Saba counties. Of these 95 miles, approximately
74.1 miles were surveyed for cultural resources. The re­
maining 20.9 miles either traverse private property or will
be an overhead utility line, and as such were not surveyed
for cultural resources. The survey efforts within Zone 2
resulted in the documentation of two new archaeological
sites and a revisit of one previously recorded site. These
sites consist of four lithic scatters (41GL404, 41GL405,
41MS84, and 41MS86), five prehistoric open campsites
(41GL403, 41GL406, 41GL407, 41GL408, and 41MS85),
two lithic procurement sites (41GL401 and 41GL409),
one multi-component lithic scatter and historic homestead
(41MS68), and one historic pit feature (41GL402).

Zone 3
Zone 3 stretches across Edwards, Kerr, Kendall, and Real
counties and contains approximately 51.8 miles of tele­
communications cable routes. A total of 40.57 miles were
surveyed for cultural resources and 92 shovel tests were ex­
cavated throughout Zone 3 over the course of four separate
field visits. The survey of Zone 3 resulted in the documen­
tation of one new prehistoric lithic scatter (41KR675) and
the revisit of a previously recorded lithic scatter (41KR1).
Both sites are confined to surface contexts and have been
moderately to severely impacted by roadway construction
and maintenance.

Zone 4
Zone 4 is located in Bandera, Medina, Real, and Uvalde
counties and is composed of five separate project areas.
A total 76.52 miles of telecommunications cables will be
installed throughout Zone 4. Of this total, 61.03 miles were
surveyed for cultural resources, resulting in the documenta­
tion of five new archaeological sites and the revisit of six
previously recorded archaeological sites. The five newly

100

Chapter 9

recorded sites consist of three lithic scatters (41UV476,
41UV477, and 41ME209), one open campsite with a
burned rock midden (41BN213), and one open campsite
(41RE128). The six revisited sites consist of three lithic
scatters (41UV83, 41UV86, and 41UV87), two burned rock
middens (41UV446 and 41BN104), and one open campsite
(41UV447). It should be noted that background research
for Zone 4 indicated that an additional five previously
recorded sites (41UV84, 41UV85, 41UV88, 41UV363,
and 41UV371) were mapped within the project APE. The
survey efforts failed to find evidence of these sites within
the project APE.

Zone 5
Zone 5 is located in Kerr County and is composed of four
routes that have been grouped into a single project area.
The routes have a total length of approximately 7.21 miles
and approximately 2.49 miles were surveyed for cultural
resources. The survey included the excavation of 32 shovel
tests as well as the documentation of one new prehistoric
lithic scatter (41KR685).

ManageMent reCoMMendatIons
The archaeological surveys throughout Zones 1–5 cov­
ered a total of 251.78 miles and involved a total of 1,264
shovel tests. In general, the majority of the routes were
found to traverse rocky uplands with little to no topsoils
and low probability for buried, cultural deposits. Roadway
related disturbances were consistently high throughout the
entirely of the projects. Drainage features, existing buried
and overhead utilities, and driveways were also commonly
encountered within the project areas. Overall, the survey
documented a total of 29 new archaeological sites and
revisited 10 previously recorded archaeological sites that
extend into the project APEs (Table 9.1). None of the sites
documented as a result of the survey effort were delineated
beyond the public ROW boundary. The dominate site types
within the project areas are lithic scatters or prehistoric
open campsites. These sites are generally composed of
non-diagnostic artifacts and burned rock scattered on the
surface or in near-surface contexts in upland settings. In
most cases, the roadway-related disturbances have mod­
erately to severely impacted the artifact assemblages, and
therefore have reduced the research value of the site. Spe­
cifically, 33 of the 39 documented sites within the project
APE are recommended as ineligible for designation as an
SAL. This is due primarily to the disturbed contexts in
which the sites reside, overall lack of diagnostic artifacts or
intact features, and lack of buried, intact cultural deposits
or good preservation potential. SWCA recommends no
further archaeological investigations within the APE in the
locations of these 33 archaeological resources.

The six remaining sites were determined to have potentially
significant cultural deposits that warrant further investiga­
tions. Given the scope of the project, the survey-level efforts
were not extensive enough to adequately assess the signifi­
cance of these sites, and such the SAL eligibility status’
are considered undetermined. The sites with undetermined
SAL eligibility include 41BN104, 41BN213, 41BN218,
41GL403, 41GL408, and 41MS68. All six sites will be
totally avoided by HCTC and no adverse impacts will occur.

site 41bn104
Site 41BN104, also known as the Gunsight Mound, is a
previously recorded site located in Zone 4 within the APE of
the Tarpley Routes. This site is most notable by the presence
of a large burned rock midden. This roughly 6-foot-high
mound, while covered in trees, is highly visible from Wil­
liams Road and has been fenced off to discourage looters.
The current field survey encountered both flakes and
burned rock in a layer of dense, compact clay loam beneath
a blocky, clay loam layer identified as a plow zone that
extends from 0–35 cmbs. This deeper layer is believed to
be intact, suggesting that intact site deposits are present
within the APE. The depth of these deposits is unknown, as
the extremely compact soil prevented deep shovel testing.
Based on the presence of intact, buried cultural deposits as
well as the prominent burned rock midden, SAL eligibility
status of site 41BN104 is currently undetermined. Addi­
tional archaeological investigations are recommended to
fully evaluate the significance of the site, and the site is
recommended for avoidance. As the project sponsors have
adopted a complete avoidance policy regarding significant
cultural resources within the APE, HCTC has agreed to
avoid impacts to the site through directional boring under­
neath the site. As such, no further work is recommended
at site 41BN104.

site 41bn213
Site 41BN213 is a prehistoric open campsite located within
Zone 4 in the APE of Tarpley Route 4F. The site was ini­
tially recognized by a discrete concentration of burned rock
and lithic material exposed in a shallow road cut along the
narrow eastern ROW of Williams Creek Road. Shovel tests
excavated nearby revealed an additional deposit of lithics
and burned rocks at a depth of 35–65 cmbs. No diagnos­
tic artifacts were observed. Presently, the SAL or NRHP
eligibility status of site 41BN213 is undetermined based
on restricted investigations and on the high probability for
additional intact, buried archaeological deposits on the site.
SWCA recommends that the site be avoided until additional
testing investigations can be initiated. As the project spon­
sors have adopted a complete avoidance policy regarding
cultural resources within the APE, the fiber cable will be

site 41bn218
Site 41BN218 is a prehistoric burned rock and lithic scatter
located in Zone 1 along Medina North Route 3F. Within the
project APE, a dense concentration of lithic artifacts and
burned rock were noted in several shovel tests at depths
ranging from 15–40 cmbs. The high number of artifacts
as well as a potentially intact burned rock feature within a
discrete stratigraphic deposit indicates that the likelihood
of encountering additional buried features or diagnostic
artifacts within the HCTC APE is high. There is also a high
probability that the site extends beyond the public ROW
to the north along Rhyme Creek and may contain substan­
tial intact cultural deposits in these areas. Further testing
investigations are warranted to determine the nature and
extent of the cultural deposits of site 41BN218 within the
project APE. With this in mind, the SAL eligibility status

of site 41BN218 is undetermined pending additional test­
ing investigations. Presently, HCTC has agreed to adopt
an avoidance plan, and as such, the fiber optic line will be
directionally bored under the site to a depth of 200 cmbs.
This depth will give a 150-cm (approximately 5-foot) buf­
fer between the deepest observed cultural deposits and the
fiber optic line.

site 41gl403
Site 41GL403 a prehistoric open campsite located in Zone
2 in the Doss South Route 4F. The site is composed of a
scattering of lithic debitage and burned rock noted on the
surface and within six positive shovel tests. Surface artifacts
were observed in two broad concentrations that appeared
to be eroding from the steep shoulder along the northern
portion of the ROW.
No diagnostic artifacts were observed in the investigated
portion of the site. Overall, due to the presence of subsurface
cultural materials and features, further work is needed to

Summary and Recommendations
identify the exact chronology, contexts, and significance of
the site. Therefore the SAL eligibility status of site 41GL403
is undetermined and avoidance is recommended. HCTC has
subsequently agreed to avoid impacts to the site by direc­
tional boring underneath the site. As such, site 41GL403
does not stand to be impacted by the proposed undertaking.

site 41gl408
Site 41GL408 is a prehistoric open campsite located in
Zone 2 in the Doss South Route 4F. The portion of the site
within the project APE is composed of lithics and burned
rock noted on the surface and within the upper 30 cm of
sediment. While no formal features were observed in the
investigated portion of the site, a somewhat large, but dif­
fuse midden of ash and burned rock was observed west of
the ROW boundary. In addition, two possible features are
eroding from the slope and a large area of scattered burned
rock and flakes was observed in the western portion of the
current ROW, but outside of the fiber APE. Overall, the site
is predominantly surficial with one Pedernales projectile
point observed within the site. Disturbances include those
associated with typical roadway construction and mainte­
nance as well as some vegetation clearing on the east side
of the road. Currently, the proposed fiber APE traverses the
east side of the site. Overall, due to the presence of subsur­
face cultural materials and features, further work is needed
to identify the exact chronology, contexts, and significance
of the site. The eligibility status of site 41GL408 is consid­
ered undetermined and avoidance is recommended. HCTC
has agreed to avoid impacts to the site through directional
boring underneath the site.

site 41Ms68
Site 41MS68 is a previously recorded multi-component site
consisting of a prehistoric lithic scatter and a historic home­
stead located in Zone 2 along the Doss West Jackrabbit &
Lange Mills Road routes. Presently, the historic component
of the site is located outside of the project APE and does not
stand to be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
The prehistoric component consists of a large artifact
scatter that extends into the current APE. The prehistoric
component of the site appears to have been disturbed by
the historic structure component of the site, associated
ranching activities, and road grading and maintenance.
However, the cultural deposits observed in the erosional
cuts extend from the surface to approximately 50 cmbs.
Further archaeological investigations are needed to deter­
mine the integrity and significance of the subsurface pre­
historic deposits. Given the relatively intact nature of the
adjacent historic component coupled with the buried, in­
tact prehistoric component within the APE, an avoidance
plan was recommended for the site. Currently, the SAL el­
igibility status of the site is undetermined pending further

103

testing and archival research. HCTC has agreed to comply
with the recommended avoidance plan, and as such, the
fiber optic line will be directionally bored under the site to
a depth of 200 cmbs. This depth will give a 150-cm (ap­
proximately 5-foot) buffer between the deepest observed
cultural deposits and the fiber optic line.
