ABSTRACT
The Thomas F. McKinney homestead and mill complex represents an upper class Anglo rural
occupation dating after the Texas Republic Period (1850’s) with subsequent occupation by rural
blacks. Pedestrian survey, archeological prospecting, and excavation by the Texas Archeological
Society Field School and Texas Parks and Wildlife personnel defined prehistoric occupations and
historic structures along with background, historical, and environmental data. Some prospecting
techniques revealed probable additional archeological features. Survey and excavation data
helped minimize site damage during development of McKinney Falls State Park.

MILL
We are pleased to hear that the Hon. Thomas F. McKinney has erected an elegant
flouring mill on Onion Creek, about four miles from the city, and is prepared to
manufacture flour of a superior quality. Among all the wants of this rich country,
none has been felt so seriously as that now supplied by the enterprise of Mr.
McKinney. Up to the present time, all the flour used in Western Texas has been
imported from the North, creating an immense drain upon the cash resources of
the country. We hope now to see this drawback arrested, in giving ample encouragement to the public spirited efforts of Mr. McKinney to supply among us an
all-important improvement. In no country can better wheat be grown than in ours,
and it is a burning reproach to us to longer rely upon imported flour for our daily
bread (Texas State Gazette, July 10, 1852:3).

Research Design
Excavations at the mill were designed to "trace the walls of the structure . . . [to] determine whether the mill is of the turbine type and the direc~
tion of the outlet tunnel" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:4). TAS excavated 69
units, mostly I x 1 m squares, at various locations around the mill. The main
emphasis was on the machine room just south of the wheel pit where details
of walls and machinery installation were noted. Excavations in the wheel pit
were aborted when time and depth became a problem. Subsequent excavation by Parks and Wildlife Department personnel (September and October,
1974) exposed the mill turbine and defined the tailrace to a certain extent.
Data concerning these excavations, artifacts, and architectural notes are presented in this report as they complement the research design.

Excava~ons
An expandable metric grid pattern was established, oriented parallel to the
main wall lines. The east west grid lines were labeled A, B, etc., starting in the
south with A. The north south grid lines were labeled 1, 2, etc., starting in the
west with 1. Units were identified by their southeast corner; thus, Unit A1 was
located in the extreme southwest corner and Unit T26 in the northeast corner.
Elevations were taken from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department monuments and converted into meters.
Brush was cleared away from the interior of all obvious wall lines. Units
selected for excavation were swept clean; recovered artifacts were labeled
surface and plotted on level records. Units were carefully troweled in 10 cm
levels. Level I is 1-10 cm below surface and Level II is 10-20 cm below surface. Excavated matrix was passed through 1/4 in mesh hardware cloth; all
artifacts and faunal remains were saved.
Thirty nine units were excavated in the machine room and eight in the
north room. Nine shallow units were placed at strategic points, such as wall
corners and pier foundations, to trace structural details.
A wooden bridge was constructed across the wheel pit around the mill shaft
to prevent it from shifting as the excavation proceeded. Four low artifact yield
units were excavated in the wheel pit, but little was learned of the nature of the
feature. The units were left open at the request of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department and work was resumed (September, 1974) by Parks and Wildlife
personnel.
The later work by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department utilized the
TAS grid system and reference points. One large unit was opened, rather
than the standard 1 m units used by TAS. Matrix was not screened due to
budget constraints and a more than adequate TAS sample.
In excavating the wheel pit, all fill was removed and all in situ artifacts
accurately plotted. Fill was placed in a large heavy duty garbage can and lifted
using a nylon climbing rope, a rescue pulley, and a front end loader. The can
was hand dumped into the front end loader bucket and removed to a backdirt
pile. Mapping was facilitated by dropping plumbs at I m intervals and triangufating from these points. Line levels provided vertical control from transit
surveyed datum points.
Each artifact was bagged separately or by lot and its provenience noted.
Each artifact in a lot had a discrete provenience and no two artifacts in any lot
were similar. Although it was possible to keep the specimens separate, the
system proved difficult to use in the laboratory and is not recommended.
Heavy pick work on the fallen building stone complicated control and often
endangered the workers.
Deposit
The machine room fill varies from sandy loam to clayey silt which was very
hard when dry and turned dark gumbo when wet. Metal and glass artifacts
were interspersed with rock rubble and displaced building stone. The deposit
changed to mostly limestone rubble and mortar as excavation proceeded into
the lower levels. Ant burrows and roots of a large persimmon tree disturbed

McEachern and Ralph - McKinney Homestead

the northeastern portions of the room.
Excavations into the millrace deposit beneath the stone arch (L16) encountered a loose black sediment with many roots and a few small rocks. At the 1020 cm level, mortar and limestone were mixed with window glass artifacts.
Deposits of sterile yellow sediment were in the southeast corner of the north
room (016). This deposit is possibly water washed materials from flood or
erosion later buried by wall collapse.
Fill in the wheel pit consisted of stratified layers of black clayey gumbo and
medium to coarse yellow sands. The upper fill slopes from the walls toward
the wheel on a fairly gentle grade. It appears that alternating floods washed in
different segregated materials. Rough faced limestone blocks, 5-25 kg each,
lie haphazardly throughout the fill. Mortar mixed with metal and glass artifacts
appear washed in, since a discernible pattern could not be noted until reaching the turbine at the bottom of the excavation. A hole 3.7 m by about 1.5 m
and almost 4 m deep (about 20 m3) was excavated down to the water table
(an elevation of 143 m). Enough of the turbine could be exposed in the
allowed time to show how the system worked. Another 0.5 m or so of fill still
lies underwater and could not be excavated without using a pump.
Architecture
McKinney’s mill (41TV289) sits on a flat expanse of exhumed beach berm
of McKown limestone (Fig. 1). The remains of the mill are a low foundation of
hand faced rock consisting of several rooms. These rooms almost completely
surround a rectangular hole 6 x 9 m and 1.5 m deep with a protruding iron
shaft.
The mill consists of many components: the millpond, race, forebay, wheel
pit, tailrace, and main superstructure which housed the installed machinery
(Fig. 2).
MILLPOND
A dam was constructed to divert water about 130 m upstream from the mill
and just above the upper edge of the falls. The importance of proper dam
construction is stressed by Hughes (1850:135): "In the first place a good
foundation is necessary to protect the dam from breaks and accidents by the
burrowing of musk rats, which occasion the destruction of so many mill
dams." Notches 30 cm wide were cut into the limestone bedrock to secure
the ends of the dam. Between the notches, a series of holes was drilled into
the bedrock and steel rods were inserted. These rods are what remains of the
dam structure. The dam probably was constructed of cypress wood with timber ends placed in the notches and secured to the iron rods.
The pooled water above the falls is normally at 145.92 m elevation. The
top of the highest iron stake is 146.76 m and the top of the forebay is
147.97 m. The dam was, therefore, greater than 1 m but less than 2 m high.
This height probably was too deep for fording by wagon. Reconstruction of
the millpond (McEachern and Ralph, 1980:16) shows the water level at
147.5 m, which would make the dam 1.58 m high and 0.74 m above the
tallest iron stake. A wing dam of the same iron rod construction on the east
bank diverted the water into the millrace.

MILLRACE
The millrace delivers water from the millpond to the forebay. The race at
McKinney’s mill, which was 108 m long and about 3.5 m wide, utilized a
natural channel in the bedrock. The north side of the millrace was formed by
the north bank of the stream. At least part, if not all, of the stream bank is
faced with rock. The south side of the race was formed in part by the wing
dam and in part by natural bedrock. Remnants of two rock pillars 11 m upstream from the forebay and in line with the wing dam may have been part of
a water gate which was used to divert water away from the mill and regulate
water level.
FOREBAY
Water from the millrace passed under a stone arch (part of the west wall of
the mill proper) and into the forebay, a large reservoir about 6 x 2.5 m and
deeper than 5 m. The forebay was constructed by quarrying a roughly square
6 x 6 m hole deeper than 5 m through a bed of McKown limestone and into
the soft pyroclastic member below. The rock excavated from the hole was
identical in appearance to rock used to construct an east west trending wall
70 cm thick across the center of the hole dividing it into two sections. The
northern section formed the forebay which created the head of water pressure
used to turn the wheel.
A hole ca 50 x 50 cm near the base of the wall allowed water under
pressure to flow into the penstock. A water gate on the forebay side of the wall
normally was used to control water flow. Two niches 20 x 20 cm and 68 cm
apart (center to center) in the cross wall between the forebay and wheel pit
and directly above the penstock are assumed to have anchored the mechanism for opening and closing the water gate. Two additional niches, similar to
those for the water gate control, were found 1.75 m east in the cross wall and
may indicate a second water gate, penstock, and waterwheel (Fig 3.)
WHEEL PIT
The wheel pit housed the penstock and water wheel and was located south
of the forebay (Fig 4.). Dimensions are approximately the same as those of
the forebay. A wall is present on the west side of the wheel pit. The wall
extends upward from the lowest point reached in excavation to the base of the
McKown limestone. The purpose of the wall apparently was to prevent the
soft pyroclastic rock from eroding.
Water entered the wheel pit through an aperture near the base of the cross
wall and was directed to the waterwheel by the penstock. The penstock was a
50 x 50 cm sq chute made of cypress and held together by a metal band or
collar. The penstock sloped down 30 cm along its length and directed the
stream of water to the side of the wheel.
The wheel laid horizontally with the vertical shaft extending from the center. The wheel was 1.3 m in diameter with a metal rim running around the
edge of it. Ten bolts protruded from the top of the exposed portion of the
wheel. They probably held a wooden disk in place over the top of the wheel.

The buckets or blades on the wheel were curved and directed the water
inward to the center of the wheel,
A circular wood collar 40 cm in diameter surrounded the metal shaft and
extended downward onto the top of the wheel. It apparently rested on a
metal plate. The top of the collar was 1.4 m above the top of the wheel and
had two octagonal metal bands running around it. The collar may have functioned as a bearing. A metal rod extended from the collar and may have been
a type of adjusting lever.
TAILRACE
Water discharged from the center of the wheel flowed 15-20 m through a
tunnel and back into Onion Creek. The roof of the tunnel was approximately
3 m above the level of the water in the wheel pit. The width of the tunnel was
not determined.
SUPERSTRUCTURE
The superstructure of the mill is divided into four parts. The main mill,
which in part straddles the forebay/wheel pit, has three rooms: the south
room or machine room; the middle room which is directly above the forebay/
wheel pit; and the north room just up slope. The southeast foundations, the
northwest foundations or east west running wall, and the piers or foundations
to the west form the other parts (Fig. 2).
South Room

The machine room has the largest variety of architectural features found at
the mill. The room measures 7.5 m east west and 3.2 m north south. Several
large saw cut stone blocks are arranged to receive large machines. Anchor
bolts and stud holes are arranged in the eastern third of the room. A wooden
door lintel and plastered walkway suggest an entrance in the north corner of
the east wall. The western part of the room is rubble filled and has a pier
toward the northwest corner. It probably was floored to the height of the large
blocks, but flooring is not evident. The bolt pattern is southeast of the turbine
but directly south of where the projected second wheel would be located.
Middle Room
The middle room is 6.4 m north south by 9.2 m east west. Large niches in
the north and south walls indicate a floor sitting on heavy beams at ca
148.5 m elevation. The beams, running north south, were at least 19 x
33 cm and probably supported in the middle.
North Room
The north room measures 4.4 m north south and 5.3 m east west. The
northern two corners are well defined, but the east wall was never connected.
It is possible that this area may represent a dock or loading area.
Southeast Foundations
Foundations extending east from the machine room indicate another room
perhaps 5 m east west and 4-5 m north south. Work was not done in this area

McEachern and Ralph - McKinney Homestead

other than clearing brush along the south wall for mapping purposes. The
northern half of the room still is covered by rock rubble.
Northwest Foundations
A faintly traced wall is an extension of the east west wall between the middle
and north rooms of the mill. Foundations were not noted north of this wall. It
is believed that the wall represents a stone retainer used to keep slope wash
out of the millrace. The wall is 12.8 m long.
West Piers or Foundations

Two foundations buttress the west wall of the machine room and four pairs
of evenly spaced piers extend west to a point due south of the northwest
foundation ending point. A lone pier is located another meter west and
slightly south of the westernmost pair. The function of these piers is unknown,
but they may have been part of a long raised shed. The shed may have
housed a sawmill, storehouse, or any type of mill related machinery. Mill
power could have been easily brought into this area.

Very little faunal material was recovered from the mill excavation. Only
four species were identified: Trionyx (softshell turtle), Didelphis marsupialis
(opossum), Sylvilagus (cottontail), and Sus scrofa (domestic pig). With the
exception of a tooth from S. scrofa, identified remains are from native species
(Table 1).

Mill Artifacts
Mill excavation produced 1,461 artifacts including specimens of ceramic,
glass, metal, and miscellaneous materials. Only 12 ceramic sherds and three
lithic artifacts were recovered. The metal artifacts are represented by fasteners
(nails, spikes, pins, bolts, nuts, etc.), a few tools, and miscellaneous identified
and unidentified specimens. Classification is first by material and then by
function.

CERAMICS
Only 12 ceramic sherds were recovered from the mill excavation. Sherds
are from whitewares with a relatively hard white paste and clear glaze. Decoration includes repousse edge, monochromatic transfer printed, and hand
painted underglaze. The ceramics fit well into the time period when the mill
was known to be in use. Transfer printing is common in sites from 1790 to
1850, and hand painted Gaudy Dutch is dated 1830-1860 (Walker,
1971:116; Roberson, 1974:43). The single maker’s mark recovered dates
1845-1856.
Plates
Number of specimens: 3 sherds (from two vessels)
Provenience: 022, $20, T16
Description: Two sherds are from a whiteware plate with a repousse edge. The remaining
specimen is a body sherd from a whiteware plate.
Basin
Number of specimens: 2 sherds (from one vessel)
Provenience: L16, $17
Description: Whiteware basin or pitcher from which these fragments came had a base about
15.5 cm in diameter.
Bowl
Number of specimens: 4 sherds (from one vessel)
Provenience: C23(2), D22, D23
Description: Whiteware bowl with hand painted, underglaze floral design in red, green, blue,
and black.
Discussion: Gaudy Dutch style decoration usually considered to date 1830-1860 (Roberson,
1974:43).
Vase
Number of specimens: 1 sherd
Provenience: $20
Description: Sherd comes from a straight sided whiteware vessel faceted on the outside. It
may have been a vase.
Maker’s Mark
Number of specimens: 1 sherd
Provenience: K15
Description: Whiteware sherd has the mark and name of Edward Walley and the words
"IRONSTONE CHINA."
Discussion: Godden (1971:97) assigns the mark to Edward Walley, Cobridge, Staffordshire,
ca 1845-1856.
Transfer Ware
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D22
Description: Small sherd of whiteware with monochromatic red transfer print. Vessel form
could not be determined.
Discussion: Transfer printing was most popular between 1790-1850 (Walker, 1971:116).

BOTTLENECKS
Number of specimens: 4
Provenience: D22, D24, 122, $21
Description: D22: Light green neck sherd without a rim; 13 mm inside diameter of mouth;
possibly from the same bottle as the base with a pontil mark. D24: Olive; rim type M
(Boice, 1980:170); 19 mm inside diameter of mouth. 122: Clear; wire rim with metal
screw on cap attached. $21: Light green neck sherd without a rim; 13 mm inside
diameter of mouth; possibly from the same bottle as the base with the pontil mark.
BOTTLE BASES
Number of specimens: 2
Provenience: D22(2)
Description: One specimen is a green circular base 69 mm in diameter with straight sides.
The other specimen is a light green bottom sherd with a pontil mark.
Discussion: According to Lorraine (1968:36):
A pontil mark is a spot of rough glass in the center of the bottom of a bottle. It is
formed when the pontil rod is attached to the base with a glob of molten glass to
hold the object while the blow pipe is struck off and the raw edge is finished. It was
used exclusively until 1857 when the snap case was introduced to replace the
pontil rod for finishing bottles.

Colored Body Sherds
CLEAR
Number of specimens: 22
Provenience: D16(3), D17, 120(11), 122(4), Lots 27, 55, 62
Description: Clear sherds; one basal corner. Sherds from the mill shaft (Lots 27, 55, and
62) appear to come from the same bottle.
AMBER
Number of specimens: 6
Provenience: D19, E25, 119(2), Lots 26, 28
Description: Amber colored; sherds from 119 appear to be from one vessel. Sherds from
Lots 26 and 28 are from a cylindrical bottom ca 70 mm in diameter.
OLIVE
Number of specimens: 7
Provenience: D19(6), D21
Description: Olive colored; sherds from D21 appear to be part of a circular base.
GREEN
Number of specimens: 12
Provenience: D20, D22(10), 118
Description: Green colored sherds.
LIGHT GREEN
Number of specimens: 11
Provenience: D22(5), $20, $21(5)
Description: Light green body sherds which probably are associated with $21 and D22 light
green neck sherds and D22 light green base with pontil mark.
Window Glass
Number of specimens: 757 (1.37 kg)
Provenience: Table 2
Description: Window glass.
Discussion: The most common artifacts in the mill at McKinney Falls were broken sheet glass.
The largest fragment of window pane weighs 255 gr. Four concentrations of window glass
came from the major excavations in the southern part of the mill. Evidence is too spotty to
reconstruct either a pane or a window. One pane has a dimension of 29.2 cm, but it cannot
be discerned whether that is width or length. Glass thickness is a uniform 2 mm.

METAL
Ammunition

Too few cartridges (10) were recovered from the mill to yield any valid
conclusions, Artifact recovery by the Parks and Wildlife Department was poor
due to low budgeting; consequently, screening was not available. Further
excavation should consider this aspect as any cartridges from the lower levels
will be old.

Fasteners

This functional class consists of 301 specimens which includes nails, rivets,
screws, nuts, bolts, washers, and harness parts. Nails were the second most
common artifact (267 specimens) found at the mill. A total of 139 typable
nails was found, plus eight spikes, three horseshoe nails, a tack, and a staple.
Of the typed nails, 133 were cut; the remaining were hand wrought. Of the
cut nails, 106 were common nails; 12 were finishing nails; and the remaining
15 had hand wrought heads (Fig. 6). Nine different pennyweight classes were
present and a total of 15 different nail types was recovered. In addition to the
typed nails, 115 fragments were recovered.
NAILS
Nails were classified by the following methods. Unbroken nails in good
condition were separated into types and sizes. Using various pennyweight (d)
standards, nails were placed in the general pennyweight class which they
seemed to fit best. These standards include U.S. 1876, 1897, 1931 (Walker,
1971:69); Simmons (1884); A. Baldwin (1891); and Unknown (Fontana
and Greenleaf, 1962:56). After this preliminary sorting, nails were shifted
around until there seemed to be a reasonable break between the different
pennyweights. Then the fragmentary but classifiable nails were added to the
established types on the basis of head style and shank diameter (Table 3).
Nails from the McKinney mill appear to fall into a very short time span.
Absence of wire nails suggests that the nails relate to the mill itself and not to
any later structures. Most nails probably date from the original construction of
the mill, although some may come from alterations or additions made after
the original construction and before the mill was destroyed in 1967.

Description: Nails are 2 1/2 in long (excluding head) and have handmade heads
with two facets each. Direction of iron fibers is lengthwise. Nail plate was cut from
opposite sides.
Discussion: Cut nails with handmade heads were common from 1790 to the mid1820’s when they were replaced with machine headed nails. These early nails
had iron fibers running across or perpendicular to the length of the nail. Around
1840, nails were manufactured with iron fibers lengthwise like the McKinney Falls
specimens (Nelson, 1868).

10d FINISHING
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D23
Description: Shank is 3 in long.
Discussion: This nail illustrates the difficulty in using pennyweight classes. Following
Fontana and Greenleaf (1962:56), the specimen can be classified as 10d. Following the U.S. standards for 1876 (Walker, 1971:69), it would be classed as 12d.

Piton or Eyed Wedge
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 48
Description: A simple wedge point, 24 x 9 mm (probably hammered out), formed on
one end of a 20 x 12 mm piece of iron bar. At 10 cm length, the bar turns 90°,
perpendicular to the wide plane of the wedged end, and expands to form a 40 mm
diameter circle with a 16 mm hole (Fig. 12).
Discussion: Form suggests that the wedge was driven into a rock wall and a rope or
pulley attached to the eye which appears slightly worn at the proper points. However, the end opposite the wedge is not battered; perhaps it was never used.

Description: Die to cut standard threads (2.125 mm center to center) on a 13 mm (1/2 in)
bolt.
MILL PICK
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 48
Description: Hammer is 223 x 38 x 22 mm and has a rectangular hole 22 x 10 mm and
chisel edges on both ends. Working edges are at right angles to the handle (Fig. 15).
Discussion: The Descriptive Pamphlet of the Richmond Mill Furnishing Works (1873:89)
discusses the three eye sizes made in their factory. Mill picks are for light cracking, heavy
cracking, and furrowing.
MONKEY WRENCH
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 59
Description: Iron monkey wrench has a main bar 15 mm thick with a jaw consisting of three
bars. The upper jaw bar is 112 mm long, 32 mm wide, and 30 mm thick tapering down
and away from the main bar. The lower jar bar is 155 mm long, 32 mm wide, and 30
mm thick tapering up and away from the main bar. A bar 110 mm long, 20 mm wide,
and 15 mm thick slides through a hole in the sliding jaw against the handlebar acting as a
wedge to hold the jaws closed (Fig. 16).
Discussion: Patented in 1835, 1839, and in the 1840’s (six times) under the name Screw
Wrench, it gradually replaced the common wrench as a carpenter’s tool. The sliding jaw
was later adjusted by various forms of screws (Mercer, 1968:278).
REAPER SECTION
Number of specimens: I
Provenience: D19
Description: Tempered steel, 2.5 mm thick, measures 89 mm across the base. It was cut 28
mm from the base on an angle of 45° from each side to an apex 69 mm from the base.
Two angled surfaces were serrated and beveled about 22° to form cutting edges. Two 4
mm holes for attaching this blade to the mower were drilled 13 mm from the base and
16,5 mm from each side (Fig. 17).
SEMICIRCULAR LEATHER KNIFE BLADE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 50
Description: Semicircular blade, 150 mm wide, 70 mm long, and 30 mm thick. A projection 53 mm long is in the center of the straight edge. It probably was used to connect the
blade and handle. A seamed and banded brass ring, 10 mm wide and 16 mm in
diameter, is on the projection. It bands the handle onto the blade.
Discussion: Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1902:419) shows a 6 1/2 in harness maker’s round
knife with a rosewood handle selling for 75¢.

TAP
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D20
Description: A fragment, 55 mm long and broken on each end. It had fine threads (.635
mm center to center or 40 to the inch) and would cut a 5.9 mm (7/32 in) hole.
Discussion: Many types of taps found in the Sears, Roebuck & Co. Catalogue (1902:609)
appear similar to this specimen. Fine thread taps were used principally by gunsmiths.
Machinery
ADJUSTING LEVER
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 60
Description: A round 354 mm iron bar with nuts on either end. Nut on one end measures
39 x 40 mm and has charcoal showing on the outside end. Nut at the other end of the
bar measures 33 x 36 mm and has tracks of uncharred wood attached to inside,
indicating that the bar was embedded in wood. An iron lever just below the larger nut
has a diameter of 30 mm at the point closest to the iron bar and a diameter of 26 mm at
the other end. The lever now is rusted in place but appears to have fit loosely around the
bar allowing it to swivel (Fig. 18).
Discussion: This artifact was an integral part of the turbine and came out of place only when
no longer surrounded by matrix. The eyed bar was embedded in the large wooden
collar which surrounds the shaft above the turbine. It is speculated that this setup allowed the miller to adjust the veins or blades of the turbine to proper pitch via an
attached rod and handle which ran up through the floor near the millstone assembly.
References were not found to corroborate this hypothesis.

fragments

Description: Wheel fragment is 165 x 40 x 22 mm and has the remnants of a spoke. In
cross section, it looks pentagonal with a 22 mm wide base. Wheel is 400 mm in diameter
and was probably a part of some machinery.
HANDLE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 61
Description: Specimen is a round metal bar with ends turned up 90° to form two handles
about 185 mm high. The main bar is 305 mm long and 16 mm wide. In the center, the
width of the bar expands to 45 mm forming a diamond shape with a hole in the center
for attachment to the object to be turned (Fig. 19).
Discussion: The handle appears to fit the pinion gear which in turn fits the rack gear.
PINION GEAR
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 48
Description: Pinion gear is 400 mm long and has a central shaft 24 mm in diameter. This
shaft has a U connection on top 68 mm wide, 40 mm tall, and 11 mm thick. A nodule
from the central shaft extends out 12 mm and is threaded and made to take a handle. A
ring 20 mm thick and 62 mm in diameter is attached (welded?) to the center shaft 72
mm below the bottom of the U connection. A second ring is attached 165 mm below the
first ring. Four round bars 65 mm long and 13 mm in diameter equally spaced 20 mm
apart on the rings connect those two rings. Groo~ed, worn places in the bars appear 40
mm above the lower ring. Spacing of the grooves fits the rack gear comfortably (Fig.
20).
PRESSURE HANDLE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 55
Description: A 167 x 29 mm bar varying in thickness from 25 mm at the center to 4 mm at
each rounded end. Extra metal is built up on one side only; opposite side is flat. A
conical hole 12 mm in diameter is drilled into the built up center on an angle of 45°. Two
other holes, ca 6 mm in diameter and each 44 mm from the center, are drilled completely through the bar (Fig. 21).
Discussion: Although function is unknown, it possibly could be a pivot point for a rotating
pin or perhaps a belt turned pulley.
RACK GEAR
Number of specimens: 8
Provenience: Lots 40(3), 41(2), 43, 48, 56
Description: Part of one long piece, total length at least 1966 mm. Each of the rack gear
segments has from one to four holes. The 225 mm segment and 335 mm segment have
cut nails extending through these holes. The 600 mm segment is charred and has a
wave or bow unlike the others (Fig. 22).
Discussion: Wear patterns of the rack gear match the pinion gear.
SHAFT
Number of specimens: I
Provenience: Lot 37
Description: Cylindrical bar fragment 872 mm long and 63 mm in diameter. A slot in one
end (22 x 18 x 2 mm) accepts a key for attaching a pulley or bearing.

Discussion: Shafts this size commonly are used to transmit power or motion by rotation and
are called king shafts.
WEDGES
Number of specimens: 3
Provenience: D20, Lots 43, 61
Description: Specimen D20 is made of square iron bar stock 24 x 24 mm and 81 mm
long. This artifact is beveled on a single side to form a cutting edge while the opposite
end is battered (Fig. 23a). Specimen Lot 43 is a wedge 235 mm long made of square
barstock 30 x 18 mm. Specimen Lot 61 is an unused wedge (or shim) made of 64 ×
19 mm rectangular stock sheared on one end to 120 mm in length. The other end is
beveled 22° on a single side. The shearing was done poorly, resulting in a trailing lip and
slightly dished long axis.
WHEEL
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 53
Description: This round iron object has a diameter of 150 mm, it is 10 mm thick and has a
bar 75 mm long and 33 mm in diameter extending out from one side. A washer or nut
12 mm thick and 62 mm in diameter is at the base of the bar. Rectangular holes measuring 27 x 13 mm are on each side of the extending iron bar. These holes are in the iron
wheel. One is filled with iron.
Miscellaneous Metal Artifacts

Texas Archeological Society

Description: Machine nameplate 346 x 117 x 6.4 mm with four holes 7 mm in diameter,
one in each corner for mounting. Background behind letters is recessed 2 mm. Lettering
indicates that"l. G. WILLIAMS & CO. GALVESTON TEXAS" were the distributors or
agents and "TODD, MACKAY & CO. MANUFR’S. PATTERSON N. J." were the
manufacturers (Fig. 24).
Discussion: Isaac G. Williams was appointed Mayor of Galveston by the newly arrived
carpetbagger Charles Griffin in June 1867 (Graham, 1945:47). At this time, advertisements in the Galveston City Directory (Marston, 1875) failed to show Williams connected with any retail business, agricultural, or manufacturing enterprises.
Earlier (1856), Williams operated the Galveston Agricultural Warehouse at the corner of Strand and Tremont streets. He was a dealer in agricultural implements and
machines and also acted as an agent for several equipment companies on the East
Coast (Polk, 1857). Additional information about I. G. Williams’ earlier enterprises and
his relation to Samuel May Williams (McKinney’s Galveston based partner) requires
further historical research.
About 1835, Joseph Todd began manufacturing machines for spinning Manila, Russia, and other hemp into cordage or rope. He probably manufactured other machinery
including steam engines. The firm’s name was originally Todd and MacKey (sic) until
1848 when Phillip Rafferty joined in the partnership, hence the name Todd, MacKay
and Company. Todd and Rafferty later attained a reputation for steam engines and
boilers after MacKey dropped out (Bishop, 1966(3):226-227; Shriner, 1890:195).
The name plaque must have been made to order for I. G. Williams; and must have
adorned a piece of mill related machinery that was manufactured post 1848 and prior to
1855, the year MacKey left the partnership. As cordage manufacturing was unknown in
the Austin area, it is hypothesized that the machine was a steam engine probably used as
an accessory power source for the flour mill, a sawmill, or both.
WAFFLE PRESS
Number of specimens: i
Provenience: Lot 56
Description: This 146 x 120 mm iron plate, 12 mm thick, has a grooved side and a flat side
to which a handle is attached. The grooved side has 10 × 10 mm squares arranged in
six rows with nine columns. The scissor style handle is attached flush with the flat
surface, extending out from that side 90 mm. The other half of the handle appears to
have projection catches on the inside which fit into the other half of the waffle press (Fig.
25).

130 mm long and 39 mm wide at the base or step. Artifact is bent 90° at the step
leg point. Leg tapers slightly to a shoulder 43 mm away from the step. It abruptly
cuts down to a width of 24 mm and tapers again to the end point. Leg is almost
circular with a diameter of 15 mm at this end point. It appears that the shank, 85
mm long, was embedded in another material (perhaps wood), the rectangular
cross section keeping the step rigid. A wear pattern was not discernible since a
great deal of rust obscures details.

DISCUSSION
Prospecting
The results of prospecting techniques correlated well with the expected
results with few exceptions. Concentrations of metal artifacts were located at
both the house and mill through remote sensing techniques. Although pH
sediment analysis proved negative, phosphate analysis proved rewarding
with a number of concentrations occurring around the house.
Comparing the value of each technique, the pH studies were of low value
at McKinney Falls. Cook and Heizer (1951) estimates the percentage of various chemicals added to sediment by human effects are of impressive values.
Eidt (1973:206) discounts this when he states that "losses brought about by
leaching and other processes such as oxidation are relatively great..."
Successful pH surveys are lacking in the published literature, but the technique has proved sucessful at several California sites investigated by the senior author. It seems that the pH technique should not be used in areas where
limestone is present in quantity.
Some problems developed with the phosphate survey. When the initial
phosphate test was run, high phosphate was found over the entire prospecting grid. This situation contrasted markedly with samples collected by the site
survey which showed considerable variation in phosphate content. There
was some confusion as to the meaning of the results until it was realized that
the technique of collecting samples was based on sediment testing for agricultural purposes. Agricultural testing utilizes a shallow sampling depth which
apparently is unsuitable for archeological testing. A rerun of the phosphate
survey, utilizing a greater sampling depth, produced the results that were
used to construct the phosphate map. The phosphate survey gave excellent
results at a cost in keeping with the budget of most archeological projects. The
larger the area surveyed, the more valid the results.
Of all the prospecting techniques, the metal detector produced the most
detailed results. Each hit indicated a specific artifact and the distribution of
those artifacts indicated the probable location of various features. The results
require detailed plotting of artifact location and thus a greater amount of field
time than phosphate and proton magnetometer surveying. The nominal cost
of a metal Iocator makes it available for most projects.
When the results of the various techniques are compared to each other by
overlaying the different grid plots, the correlation between the various anomalies is impressive. The phosphate, proton magnetometer, and metal detector surveys produced similar results. Since the most time consuming aspect of prospecting is establishing a grid, it is recommended that as many
prospecting techniques as possible be run over the pattern before resorting to
the more expensive technique of excavation. Prospecting provides an excellent method of generating sophisticated hypotheses before the first shovel of
dirt is taken from the ground.

HOUSe

In the research design for the house, the main hypothesis was that the
"occupation deposit is expected to be thickest close to the house and diminish
rapidly as it approaches the cultivated field" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:3).
Explicit methodological steps necessary to test the hypothesis were not explored fully.
The definition of what is considered deposit was not expressed in the field
guide; also, how different excavators might interpret the individual excavation units was not considered. Further problems were introduced by not excavating all units to the same depth or to the bottom of the cultural deposit.
Another aspect of the research which was not stated but implied was the
selection of arbitrary 10 cm excavation levels. It was believed that such levels
would produce useful stratigraphic information which would allow the rate of
cultural deposition to be studied over time. However, the cultural deposit was
generally only 12 to 15 cm deep. Early and late artifacts were therefore mixed
in the first level. Five cm levels probably would have produced the desired
information. As a result, the hypothesis as stated is not testable.
The stated hypothesis does indicate the presence of some underlying assumptions which can be used to form a logical, testable, corollary hypothesis.
Cultural deposition is the major depositional factor around the house. Natural
deposition is the predominate factor away from the house. There exists a
relationship between natural and cultural deposition which varies between
the house and field.
Natural deposition can be considered as spatially occurring at a relatively
equal rate, while cultural deposition is localized and unequal in space. This
situation can be expressed as a hypothesis. Given equal volumes of matrix,
artifact density will be highest toward the house and decline as one moves
away from the house.
To adequately test the hypothesis, some artifact classes which would obviously bias the results need to be excluded from the analysis. The house can
be considered a single artifact; inclusion of window glass and nail categories in
the analysis would tend to mask the cultural depositional processes which
were in effect while the house was in use. Nails and window glass more likely
are related to erosional factors (both natural and cultural) which took place
after abandonment.
Three categories of artifacts were selected which were likely to be deposited
while the house was in use. They are bottle glass, scrap metal, and ceramics.
Since the units were excavated to different levels, only the first level (0-10 cm)
was utilized in the analysis. The total number of the selected artifacts occurring
in the first level is shown in Figure 30. The north trench conforms well with the
hypothesized distribution although the artifacts are slightly more concentrated
in N3. The relatively lower number of artifacts in N1 is an anomaly of excavation because one half of the square was located in the foundation.
The east trench differs radically from the predicted model with two distinct
anomalies present at opposite ends of the trench. E1 only contained one
artifact in the selected categories which clearly reflects its location under the
porch. Units E4 and E5 had a much greater number of artifacts than expected, defining a possible trash or midden area. This area may represent a
ditch east of the house where Charlie Johns stated that trash was dumped.

McKinney house (0-10 cm level).

Cistern
The cistern deposit differed from the model predicted in the research design in several ways. It had been assumed that the cistern had been used until
the house was abandoned; but associated artifacts indicate that it may have
gone out of use as early as 1900. Firm evidence of the 1921 flood was lacking. It is apparent that the effect of such periodic flooding was greatly overestimated. However, the assumption that the cistern would contain microfauna
which could be recovered through fine mesh wet screening was borne out by
the rich collection of recovered fauna.
The large number of artifacts recovered from the cistern allows the deposit
to be dated with unusual precision. Two of the bottles in 304 (30-40 cm) were
dated to 1905; filling of the cistern is assumed to have started sometime
around 1900. The uppermost level (301) has two bottles of a type which was
manufactured until 1929 and one of a type which ceased to be manufactured
in 1932. Deposition seems to stop around the mid-1930’s, with only a few
artifacts of more recent manufacture added after that date.
The stratigraphy of the tin cans corroborates the dating provided by the
bottles. Hole-in-the-top cans are the only type present in the lowest level,
while open-the-top rolled seam cans are the only type associated in the
highest level. The open-the-top can generally was accepted by 1922 (Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962:73).
The cistern deposit apparently is associated with the Charlie Johns’ period.
Garbage occasionally was dumped into the cistern until 1936 when Albert
Meeks moved into the house. A few additional artifacts apparently were
thrown into the cistern after the house was abandoned in the mid-1940’s.

The bulk of the faunal collection is fish (46%), followed by mammals
(28%), amphibians (15%), reptiles (10%), and birds (0.5%). The relative
percentage of the different classes remains fairly constant throughout the
deposit (Fig. 31).
The amount ’of fish in the deposit fluctuates slightly, while that of amphibians increases, sharply decreases, and then increases again. Reptiles slowly
decrease as time progresses, while mammals show a corresponding increase.
Fish represent the largest class of animal remains found (46%). This class
consists of Aplodinotus grunniens (freshwater drum), Lepornis sp. (sunfish),
Micropterus sp. (bass),Ictalurus sp. (catfish), Lepisosteus sp. (gar), and unidentified remains (Fig. 32). Lepisosteus sp. is the only identifiable genus
which occurs in quantity in the lower level. Gar is sometimes introduced into
cisterns to help keep them clean by eating insects, rodents, and other things
that fall into the water. The Lepisosteus present in the lowest level is interpreted as a cistern cleaning fish. The other fish and Lepisosteus from the other
levels are thought to be fish that were caught in the stream and cleaned at the
cistern while the cistern was used as a dump. Several fishhooks which were
recovered from the deposit support this interpretation. However, it is possible
that the fish were introduced by flooding.
Amphibians (Fig. 33) comprise 15% of the collection and represent Rana
sp. (frog), Bufo sp. (toad), Chrysernys sp. (slider turtle), Trionyx sp. (softshell turtle), and Terrapene sp. (box turtle). Ten percent of the collection is
reptiles (Fig. 33), consisting of Elaphe sp. (rat snake), Pituophis rnelanoleucus (bull snake), Crotalus sp. (rattlesnake), Agkistrodon sp. (copperhead
or cottonmouth), Phrynosoma sp. (horn lizard), and an unidentified lizard.
The amphibians and reptiles represent animals which could get into the cistern under their own power, although the turtles (Trionyx, Chrysemys, Terrapene) may have come into the cistern in the same manner as the fish, i.e.,
anthropogenically or catastrophically.
Most small animals which fall into the cistern could be expected to have
survived the 5 m drop. Four species seem to have done very well: Rana,
Bufo, Elaphe, and Crotalus. A predator/prey relationship exists between the
snakes, frogs, and toads. An increase in snakes is reflected in a corresponding
decrease in its prey.

Mammals are represented by 28% of the collections: Didelphis marsupialis
(opposum), Canis latrans (coyote), Sciurus niger (fox squirrel), Perognathus
sp. (pocket mouse), Reithrodontomys sp. (harvest mouse), Peromyscus sp.
(whitefooted mouse), Neotoma sp. (packrat), Sigmodon hispidus (cotton
rat), Lepus californicus (jack rabbit), Sylvilagus sp. (cottontail), Sus scrofa
(domestic pig), Bos tarus (domestic cow), Ovis sp. (sheep), Odocoileus sp.
(deer), and unidentified rodent bones. Remains of Sus, Ovis, Bos, and Odocoileus probably were discarded into the cistern. Didelphis and Sylvilagus
could have been deposited in the cistern by man or come into the cistern on
their own.
The mammal distribution chart (Fig. 34) indicates that Sigmodon hispidus
adapted to cistern living, although Reithrodontomys, Peromyscus, and
Neotoma should also survive well. The most surprising element is the absence
of Rattus norvegicus (norway rat) and Mus musculus (house mouse). Both of
these introduced species should have occurred in the area. Cryptotis (shrew)
is another small mammal missing from the deposit.
Birds were rare and are represented by one individual of Gus (domestic
chicken) and an unidentified species.

Mill
Excavation revealed that the type of wheel used in the mill was of the
turbine variety as hypothesized. Further research indicates the statement that
the "presence of a horizontally mounted waterwheel would be considered
proof" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:2) is not entirely correct. There is some
question as to whether a tub mill should be considered a turbine or ancestral to
it.

48

Texas Archeological Society

Evans (1795:11) states in The Young Mill-Wright and Miller’s Guide:
A tub mill has a horizontal waterwheel, that is acted on by the percussion of the
water altogether; the shaft is vertical, carrying the stone on the top of it, and serves
in place of a spindle; the lower end of this shaft is set in a step fixed in a bridge-tree,
by which the stone is raised and lowered, as by the bridge-tree of other mills; the
water is shot on the upper side of the wheel, in a tangent direction with its circumference.
Evans (1795:28) considered the tub mill superior to other types.
"Having levelled your seat, and finding that you have above 8 feet fall, and plenty
of water, and wish to build a mill on the simplest, cheapest, and best construction
to suit your seat, you will, of course, make choice of a tub mill."
The Young Mill- Wright and Miller’s Guide became the miller’s bible for the
next 50 years. Evan’s (1795) preference for the tub mill over other types
probably did much to encourage the development of the true turbine. The
turbine was invented by Ferguson about 1828 and imported to France where
it was called the tourbillion or turbine waterwheel (Hughes, 1850:56).
Hughes (1850) refers to the turbine as a reaction waterwheel because the
action of the water after it hits the bucket or vane contributes power to the
wheel. Unlike the tub mill, the reaction wheel is placed in the water and not
above it.
As the stroke by impulse is communicated to the bucket of the wheel, only one half
of the power of the column of water is received, until the other action is communicated from the wheel to the body of water in which it stands. But as soon as the
wheel moves it forms a whirling vortex, which acts in a contrary direction to the first
action of the water by impulse; consequently, by this means we receive a double
action of the same water, which gives a double power (Hughes, 1850:54).
A combination reaction wheel is a wheel designed in such a way that water
is applied at the edge of the wheel and discharged at the center of the wheel by
means of curved buckets (Hughes, 1850:58). The waterwheel at McKinney’s
mill is of this type. However, more exact identification of the wheel is difficult.
Within the last ten or fifteen years, a numerous tribe of reaction waterwheels have
sprung into existence, all aiming at the main object, if possible, to supercede each
other in using the least complement of water to perform the greatest amount of
work (Hughes, 1850:55).
The wheel pit forms the heart of the mill and also the millwright’s biggest
headache.
To the old school millwright, the wheel pit was a perpetual nightmare--a continuous performance pit in which he [the millwright] might be called at any minute, day
or night, to do a turn in water to his waist as he wrestled with rusty nuts and bolts in
an attempt to put in a new waterwheel step, three feet under water (Hobart,
1919:378).
One of the ongoing problems with a horizontal turbine wheel was that the
waterwheel step often broke down. This step was a piece of conical wood
placed in the end of the shaft below the waterwheel. At first, this piece did not
fit well; spent water from the turbine would lubricate it. Later, it would begin to
heat up, charring the wood, until charcoal formed and the step began to
crumble under the weight of the waterwheel. At some point, the step would
go down, maybe stripping the above gears.
Development of the iron cased turbine eliminated this troublesome step by
placing the shaft bearing inside the casing. This procedure marked the end of
the large wheel pit required for combination wheels. Iron cased wheels were
available by 1870 and are illustrated in the Descriptive Pamphlet of Richmond

Mill Furnishing Works (1873:Fig. 6). The MCD. Moore Mill in Van Zandt
County (Texas), which started operating in 1871, used an iron cased wheel
(Jackson, 1971:51-52). Use of water turbines to power mills began to fade in
the late 1880’s with the introduction of mechanical and electrical motive
power.
The most noticeable artifacts missing from the McKinney Falls mill collection are gearing, shafts, couplings, pillow blocks, bearings, and accessory
machinery. It appears that everything that could be salvaged was removed.
Much of the building stone was removed from the mill to construct erosion
dams (according to an interview with J. E. "Pete" Smith). Remains of these
dams still are evident about the western part of the park.

Stone Working Tools
Stone used at the house, mill, horse trainer’s cabin, and other buildings was
worked with different tools. Saw cut stone was noted at the house and mill.
Saw diameters were 111 and 91 cm; the one from the mill was not checked.
One stone at the house appeared to be cut with a handsaw.
Almost all rock used at the mill had a rock faced surface. A pitching chisel
was used in finishing most of the stone with occasional use of small droves 4.0
to 6.5 cm wide. The hole in the limestone was drilled with a 3 cm diameter
drill at least a meter long and then blasted.
Chisel work at the house was confined to a toothed chisel 4 cm wide. Most
of the interior smooth saw cut surfaces were roughened by a mason’s pick
which left marks 3.0 to 7.0 cm long and 0.7 cm wide. Marks look like afterthoughts when the stone was in place. Most begin at one o’clock and move to
seven o’clock, as if struck by a right handed mason. The stone was roughened
to accept the plaster.
The horse trainer’s cabin is of limestone with a rock faced surface. Some
chisel work was noted on the north wall and the northeast corner of the east
wall. The work was done by 6-10 cm wide straight chisels, the smaller being
called droves and the larger called tools, boasters, or bolsters (McKee,
1973:21-31). The picnic table downstream and above the supposed hog
wallow was formed mostly with wood and poured in concrete. The few chisel
marks are by droves 4-7 cm. wide.
Cartridges
The distribution of the 65 cartridges in the collection suggests function,
economics, and time. Four poorly dated rimfire .22 caliber cartridges came
from the mill (American Cartridge Co., Federal Cartridge Co., and the pre
1902 Union Metallic Cartridge Co.). The late 1800’s/early-1900’s rimfire
cartridges came from outside the house in the lower level of a trash dump (E5)
or generally in the fill outside the house (United States Cartridge Co., Winchester Repeating Arms Co., Peters Cartridge Co.). The middle-1900’s rimfire cartridges were found inside the house below the fire zone (RemingtonU.M.C., Western Cartridge Co., Peters Cartridge Co.). A .22 caliber Short
(Peters Cartridge Co.) came from level 4 (304) in the cistern.

McEachern and Ralph - McKinney Homestead

51

The distribution suggests plinking or target practice around the house.
Some shells were carried to a dump located east of the house. The main
activity occurred at the turn of the century. Rimfire are the least expensive
cartridges made in general. Rimfire weapons traditionally are popular and
inexpensive.
Center fire cartridges, externally primed, date after 1866 (Logan, 1959:8) ;
the nine in the collection appear to date after the 1880’s. The earliest sample
comes from the mill shaft. This .41 caliber Long Double Action made for the
model 1877 Colt Lightning may be early, but does not date from the time
when the mill was in operation. The absence of any early, externally primed,
center fire cartridges (which became obsolete in 1890) suggests a late date for
all gun activity at this site. Only two of the nine cartridges (.22 W.C.F. and.32
W.C.F) were made for rifles, suggesting small game hunting activities.
Twenty six shotgun shells were recovered, the bulk (15) from the cistern.
The shotgun shell literature is sketchy. The best is Vinson (in Amber,
1968:91-97) which contains some glaring errors but points out the impossibility of extracting exact dates for many brands. Cistern distribution gives a fairly
good time depth; the earliest shells are probably the 10-gauge Winchester
cartridges from the east room of the house and the mill shaft. The one plastic
case indicates small bird hunting (#6 shot); while a #2 buckshot from the
house area (El) indicates larger game.
All but two of the cartridges were fired and none appear to have been
reloaded. The collection suggests the following weapons: two rifles (.22
W.C.F., .32 W.C.F.); one automatic pistol (9 mm Luger); four revolvers
(.32 caliber, .38 caliber, .41 Colt Lightning Double Action, and .44 caliber
percussion revolver); and three shotguns (10, 12, and 20 gauge). Gun parts
were not recovered.
The cartridge collection from the Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf,
1962:79-83) indicated at least six rifles, five revolvers, and two shotguns. The
balance of these cartridges favors heavier game and military loads. If personal
protection or large game hunting were performed at McKinney Falls, it is not
demonstrable in the colleciton.
The three shotgun shells from the Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf,
1962) are slightly different from their counterparts at McKinney Falls and
probably date a little earlier. The Ward Ranch New Club cartridge has a
double circle (7.9 mm diameter and 10.7 mm respectively) head stamp
(Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962), whereas none of the six McKinney Falls
specimens has double circles. Two (from the cistern, level 4) lack a design.
The other four New Club cartridges are of two types, both showing eight
pointed star patterns (Lot 16, cistern, levels 2 and 3). Two of the smaller
caliber center fire revolver cartridges (.41 L DA and .38 S&W) are common
to the McKinney Falls and Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962) collections.
Many of the weapons were out of time and some badly in need of lepair.
The New Club shell from the bottom of the cistern was bent, the primer raised,
and the firing pin dentent was off to one side. The weapon that fired it was in
poor condition and could have injured the user by misfiring or exploding.

CONCLUSIONS
This report attempted to apply archeology in its widest sense (i.e., the study
of relationships between process and time during the epoch of man) to a
primarily historic site utilized approximately between 1850 and 1950. The
approach is environmental archeology. A particular aspect of the total environment was not singled out as being most important; some attempt was
made to capture the diversity of both archeology and environment. Environmental archeology is not simply anthropology, history, biology, botany, or
any other specifically categorized field of study. It is an attempt to study the
total resource, utilizing the standard approach of hard science which tries to
investigate the interrelationships of the smallest definable data at the least
complex levels of abstraction.
The very breadth of the subject makes conclusions hard to draw, but certain
highlights can be pointed out. In terms of the research designs, the study
largely was successful with the exception of the flood hypothesis which apparently is reflected in much more subtle data than anticipated. Other failures
stemmed from poorly expressed research designs which were not completely
thought out before going into the field. The successes, however, seem to
outweigh the failures; a number of hypotheses bore fruit.
Results of the prospecting experiments were exciting. Archeologists will
come to depend on those techniques to a much greater degree in the future.
Excavations at the house produced the suspected architectural features as
well as a clearer understanding of the nature of the deposit. The depositional
model developed needs further testing in a wider range of sites (and this site),
but it did draw attention to certain anomalies. Perhaps the further development of such models will lead to the discovery of types of anomalies which
have thus far eluded the investigators. Discovery of the relatively high percentage of porcelain around the house was not predicted but seems to bear
out the aristocratic image of McKinney reflected in the historical records.
Results of the cistern excavation far surpassed expectations. The full implications of a well dated faunal assemblage within a relatively closed environmental system has yet to be realized. The analysis presented was preliminary;
a much more detailed analysis and greater sample is necessary before the
value of the collection can be understood.
Mill excavations produced the desired results and discovery of the turbine
was a highlight in the investigations. The combination reaction type waterwheel was an important step in the development of the modern turbine;
the example recovered provides clues to the technological level of millwrighting in 1850.
Application of the environmental approach to the historic McKinney
homestead produced widely diverse but interrelated data reflecting cultural
and environmental processes which have been in effect over the last 125
years. This approach may work best in recent sites where the fossil record is
most complete. Such sites provide the necessary time depth to understand
the development of contemporary ecological and environmental problems.

APPENDIX A

INTRODUCTION
The site survey segment of the 1974 Texas Archeological Society field
school was charged with appraising the park area for archeological resources
and recording archeological sites. The northern one third of McKinney Falls
State Park was surveyed during the eight day field school; 12 sites were
recorded. Sites were defined as those areas holding a significantly high concentration of artifacts or features. Some lithic or historic scatters were not
recorded for lack of good focal points. For each site, a University of Texas at
Austin Site Survey Form was completed, and the location plotted on aerial
photographic maps and topographical maps of the park.
Site types range from prehistoric lithic scatters and rock shelters to historic
house sites.

(41TV302) Description: House Site
Remnants of an historic house are located near the top of a hill overlooking
a spring fed meadow. Dates of occupation should lie somewhere within the
range of 1850-1900. A dirt road east of the site runs north northeast and may
have been used as the entrance to the complex. Other road indications were
not found. The road leads to the McKinney home complex (41TV289), indicating a connection between the two sites.
Remains consist of a large cut stone (perhaps a corner stone) and a high
concentration of debris in the surrounding area. Metal door hinges, latches,
and a door handle were found. The house probably was made of wood
although remains of wood or other building materials were not found.
A clearing a few meters north of the house contained artifact types indicative of an outbuilding, perhaps a barn. Scattered chert flakes, unifacially
worked flakes, and bifaces were observed in the area; significant concentrations were not found. A random metal detector survey covered a portion of
the site area. Areas of concentration were determined and a representative
sample of datable artifacts collected.

(41TV303) Description: House Site
Structural remains and historic artifacts lie 230 m north of 41TV302. The
site appears to be more recent than 41TV302, dating sometime after 1900
and probably not extending beyond the mid-1904’s. The quantity of surface
material is greater than at 41TV302.

Calvert -- Site Survey

57

A garbage dump containing bedsprings, a washtub, and other discarded
household items lay nearby. Barbed wire was collected and found to be contemporaneous with a standing fence nearby. It appears the occupants lived
there for a long time period, raised chickens and horses, did some fencing,
had a garden, and farmed.
A random metal detector survey was conducted. Concentrations of material were noted and datable artifacts collected. A concentration of cut nails,
wire nails, and dimensional lumber was associated with a rockpile that might
represent a structural corner.
Glass artifacts include a McCormick & Co. panel bottle, J. R. Watkins Co.
panel bottle, Chattanooga Medicine Co. bottle, milk emulsion bottle, and two
snuff bottles. Prehistoric material included chert nodules with removed flakes
and concentrations of bifacially worked chert flakes.
(41TV304) Description: Picnic Table Site
A stone picnic table rests on the rock surface about 100 m west of
41TV302 and 120 m downstream from the mill on the left bank of Onion
Creek. It consists of a concrete slab table top resting on two rectangular pillars.
Each pillar is composed of several irregularly shaped fractured limestone
blocks. These blocks have been plastered or cemented together forming massive but uniform table supports.
Benches flanking the table are chiseled limestone in the McKinney house
style. A three wall fireplace composed mostly of hand cut stone was plastered
together forming an open ended rectangle. These stones are irregular in
shape, although some have been well formed by cutting or chiseling. Notches
are cut in the stones probably for a grill. A small rock quarry is located a few
meters away in the Upper portion of a rock ledge adjacent to the fireplace.
Measurements and computed volume compares favorably with the volume
of stone used for construction in the picnic area.
(41TV305) Description: Habitation Scatter
Another occupation site located 230 m downstream from 41TV304 was
recorded as 41TV305. It is characterized by having both historic and prehistoric material scattered in a wash. The foca! point was not located. Several
chert flakes and bifaces were observed.

(41TV306) Description: Prehistoric Chipping Station
A prehistoric locale containing numerous large, bifacially worked chert
flakes and nodules was recorded on a hilltop across from the mill and 160 m
south of Onion Creek. Several cores and concentrations of small flakes and
chips were noted. This site tentatively is defined as a chipping station. Dating
is not possible from field observations. Shovel tests did not indicate significant
subsurface deposits.

58

Texas Archeological Society

(41TV307) Description: Horse Trainer’s Cabin
A site that historical reports indicate is the house of Thomas F. McKinney’s
horse trainer is on the right bank of Rinard Creek about 350 m above Onion
Creek. Several rock fences leading away from the site appear to be of construction similar to the cabin, i.e., they have double stone walls. House structure is of cut and chiseled stone; the fence consists of irregularly fractured

stone.
More than 50% of the cabin structure is still standing. The cabin is a one
room structure house with two doors and at least one window. Remnants of a
stone corral located a short way downstream and adjacent to Rinard Creek
may be associated with this complex. The corral may have been used to trap,
hold, or shunt horses to different pastures.
(41TV308) Description: Prehistoric Midden Deposit (Rockwall Site)
A Texas Parks and Wildlife Department construction supervisor described
a burned rock midden that had been disturbed by machinery during road
construction in an area about 40 m south of 41TV306. The amount of
burned rock fragments do not support this description. Numerous chips,
flakes, several bifaces, and two projectile point fragments were found in the
disturbed areas. One point fragment has a Pedernales like form.
A small sewer line ditch adjacent to the disturbed area showed a prehistoric
midden deposit in profile. The midden lens is about 20 cm thick with an 8 to
10 cm alluvial fill above it. Materials noted in the cultural deposit include a
high number of snail shell fragments, chert chips and flakes, some charcoal,
and one mussel shell fragment. Midden is a darker color than the sediment
above and below.
A 1 x 1 m test pit was excavated adjacent to the sewer ditch. Very little
additional data were recovered although chert flakes and chips were plentiful.
A few bifaces were found but diagnostic tools were not recovered. One occupation of long duration during the Archaic period is assumed. The area of
occupation was not determined. Surface material was noted in a broad area.
(41TV309) Description: Rock Shelters
Two shallow rock shelters were observed in a bluff on the right bank of
Onion Creek across from 41TV305. One probably never was occupied (it
may have been used as a water source) ; the other was used during prehistoric
and historic times. Chert chips and flakes were collected while profiling two
pot holes located beneath signs painted on the ceiling which read "NO DIGGING BY LAW."
Projectile point fragments found in the profiles indicate small arrow technology. The occupation dates to late prehistoric times. Testing was limited to
the site surface; earlier occupation might be present in lower levels. The shelter is dry, but a spring seeps from the middle of the back wall, providing a
constant water supply. The shelter is about 40 m from Onion Creek.
The site’s historic component shows utilization of the spring. A pipe was
placed into the back wall bringing spring water to a small metal trough located
near the middle of the shelter. There is a very thick mineral deposit on the

Calvert -- Site Survey

59

trough and log support caused by overflow from the trough. This deposit may
indicate a considerable antiquity.
A metal detector survey revealed very recent tin cans and a large spike.
Sediment analysis showed a high pH count; phosphate analysis measured
medium to strong within the shelter.

(41TV310) Description: Prehistoric Chipping Station with Historic
Pits
A small scatter of lithic debris is located 75 m southwest of 41TV309. A
portion of the site displays a layer of chips, flakes, cores, and bifaces exposed
on a bare rock surface. The main site is covered with alluvium.
The historical component consists of two pits. The smaller has field limestone piled around it. The stone could have been either removed from the pit
or be the remains of a structure. Window glass eroding from the side wall a
few centimeters from the surface may indicate further a small structure. Chips
and chert flakes are scattered near the pit and may have been removed from a
lower prehistoric component. The larger pit located to the southeast utilized
wooden crossposts to support a sheetmetal covering. This pit may be a small
storage pit.
The site is located immediately above shelter site 41TV309; the two locales
could be components of the same site, both prehistorically and historically.
(41TV311) Description: Prehistoric Site
Numerous chert chips and flakes, a core, and projectile point base were
observed 200 m south of 41TV307 immediately west of a rock wall. The site
may be either a chipping station or habitation site. Chert nodules were exposed during park road constructions. Depth and lateral extent are unknown;
the site appears to be undisturbed.
(41TV312) Description: House Site
A wood frame house with wood siding and shingles overlaid by tin is Iocated near the proposed park main entrance about 450 m east of 41TV311.
The house consists of one main and two small lean-to rooms. A rock fence is
located adjacent to the house on the west side. The site is of fairly recent
origin, probably dating from the 1930’s-1940’s.
(41TV313) Description: Rock Shelters
Three rock shelters, one found below the picnic table site (41TV304) and
the other two farther to the south, occur on the left bank of Onion Creek. The
first two upstream shelters are wet with water constantly dripping from the
ceiling. The third is relatively dry but has an erosion area where water at times
pours over the upper shelter ledge. A small drainage leads down to Onion
Creek. The shelters would have been adequate for prehistoric occupation but
evidence to support this hypothesis was not found. A biface was observed at

60

the south end of the middle shelter. The middle shelter contains two square
excavation units or pot holes, but cultural debris was not located.
The shelter below 41TV304 shows utilization during modern times. A rock
hearth with ashes and modern wine bottles are of recent origin.
The small downstream shelter shows the greatest potential for prehistoric
habitation. It is dry, has a lower ceiling, and is better protected from the
weather. The surface was devoid of artifacts and testing was not initiated.
Reasons for recording these shelters as a site derives from sediment tests.
Collected sediment samples were tested for phosphate and pH content. All
samples showed a high pH. This situation can be explained by limestone in
the sediment. All but one sediment sample (14 total) showed strong to medium phosphate content. The shelters possess a sandy loam derived from
creek flooding and natural rock deterioration. The phosphate is assumed to
have come from occupation by man or animal.

CONCLUSIONS
Although historical document research was not performed, the earlier historical park sites might be compared in the future. Sites 41TV289, 41TV307,
41TV302, and 41TV304 are connected by a dirt road and contain similar
artifacts and building materials. Their cultural affinity requires more exploration. The horse trainer’s cabin (41TV307) and the rock fences were constructed during Thomas F. McKinney’s occupation at 41TV289. Herds of
cattle, sheep, horses, and mules could have been maintained by McKinney in
the large complex of rock fences on the south side of Onion Creek.
The field north of 41TV289 may have been the farming aspect of the
complex. If the barbed wire fences containing square nails are contemporaneous with the late occupation of McKinney, then perhaps the occupants of
41TV302 were overseers of this pasture. Additional historic document research, minimal site testing, and protection from both natural and anthropogenic agents are warranted for these fragile, nonrenewable resources belonging to the State of Texas and administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department.

Preservation of Metal Artifacts
Ja es Calvert
INTRODUCTION
While it is the archeologist’s responsibility to see that all artifacts brought in
from the field are stored for future analysis, it is also important that they be
preserved so that deterioration will not take place during storage. This is
expressed in the Antiquities Code of Texas (1969).
Conservation of artifacts from historical sites, where artifact numbers reach
into the thousands, may not be financially possible. In this case, it is desirable
to stabilize a select group of diagnostic specimens.

DISCUSSION
Forty metal artifacts were selected from the homestead and mill excavations and metal detector survey collections. Primary objectives were stabilization of artifacts (thus halting future deterioration); and removal of surface
encrustations and corrosive layers as an aid to identification and analysis. The
following is a list of the artifacts that were given special treatment:
Plaque
Cut Nails
Handle (Mill Machinery)
Rack Gear (Mill Machinery)
Semicircular Leather Knife Blade
Horseshoes
Spikes
Metal Button
Toy Train
Monkey Wrench
Waffle Press
Pinion Gear (Mill Machinery)
Cleaning and preservation (Calvert, ms) were processed at the Antiquities
Conservation Facility of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), University of Texas, Austin. A description of the general procedures
for cleaning metal artifacts at TARL is detailed in Hamilton (1973).
A preliminary investigation and evaluation was made of each artifact to
determine what method to employ in its cleaning and stabilization. The first
steps in assuring that all phases of preservation are reversible were taken. An
accurate description of the artifact was made before treatment. While a specimen underwent treatment, its appearance changed as corrosive compounds
were removed. Weights, measurements, sketches, and photographs were
taken at this time so that alteration during processing might be monitored. A
magnet was used to determine if there was sufficient metal in the iron artifacts
to allow removal of their corrosive compounds.
Specimens were cleaned and stabilized using electrolytic reduction after
preliminary mechanical cleaning (Hamilton, 1973; Plenderleith and Werner,
1971; UNESCO, 1968). Artifacts were separated into the following categories: 1) a brass artifact; 2) iron artifacts without sufficient metal for removal of

62

Texas Archeological Society

all corrosive compounds; 3) small iron artifacts that could be treated similarly
together and had a substantial metal core allowing all corrosive compounds to
be removed; and 4) large iron artifacts that needed to be treated individually
and could have all corrosive compounds removed.
The brass artifact was a collar that slides over the wooden handle of a
leather cutting tool. A low current density electrolysis removed its corrosive
compounds in 24 hours. It then was rinsed extensively in alternate containers
of hot and cold deionized water and allowed to dry with the aid of a water
miscible alcohol. As a final sealant, clear acrylic spray was used to prevent
further oxidation.
Two iron artifacts so severely were deteriorated that removal of their corrosive compounds would have seriously altered or destroyed their diagnostic
value. The metal button and a large portion of a leather cutting tool were
oxidized almost completely. Low current density electrolysis was used to remove the bulk of the chlorides without removing the corrosive layers. A small
amount of the corrosion then was removed mechanically.
Remaining artifacts were cleaned using a high current density electrolysis to
remove corrosive compounds. Some mechanical cleaning with a small
pneumatic chisel was used alternately with the electrolytic reduction to speed
up the treatment. The only variation in this treatment was with the large
monkey wrench and plaque. These artifacts were cleaned individually in separate electrolytic vats. Other artifacts were treated collectively in a single vat.
Specimens were cleaned in 7 to 14 days.
An extensive rinsing procedure then followed, using alternate hot and cold
deionized water to remove the electrolyte and any chlorides still remaining on
the objects. This procedure took I to 4 days. As a final sealant, artifacts were
submerged in a vat of synthetic microcrystalline wax (Gulf Microwax 75) at
350° F. until bubbles stopped evolving. The vat then was allowed to cool and
artifacts removed at 215°-225° F. Excessive wax was removed by wiping
with a rag.

CONCLUSION
Artifacts gained an aesthetically pleasing appearance and were stabilized
for storage. The three mill parts were cleaned sufficiently to be identified as a
rack, pinion gear, and a handle that may have been used to turn the pinion.
After removing the corrosive coating, the train passenger coach was identified
when the name of the railway line became visible. The train engine was
cleaned to the extent that it could be reconstructed to form an almost complete specimen showing considerable detail. The waffle iron was cleaned such
that it could be accurately measured and drawn. The cut nail collection remains as a preserved type collection of nails from the McKinney Homestead
for correlation with other historical sites.
These stabilized artifacts will be utilized in the proposed Smith Visitor Center as part of an interpretive display to be viewed and enjoyed by future
generations.

Cultural Chronology in
Central Texas

ABSTRACT
The development of cultural chronologies in the Central Texas region are reviewed briefly; two
major terminological problems are identified and discussed. The first problem is that of the preArchaic which was proposed for the region by SoUberger and Hester (1972); the second is the
variety of terms used to denote the groups who adopted the bow and arrow late in the prehistoric
cultural sequence. These problems are used as a springboard to review and restate a simplified
model of cultural chronology which may be applied to the region.
The model is based on an evolutionary cultural-historical developmental concept as defined by
Willey and Phillips (1958). It progresses from specific components to temporal phases to generalized stages of development. The existing defined, named, temporal phases proposed by Jelks
(1962) and Weir (1976) are refined. Where appropriate, they are divided into newly named
phases within the structure of the chronological model. Summary descriptions of 13 proposed
temporal phases which compose two of the four developmental stages within the Central Texas
region are presented.

INTRODUCTION
Chronological constructs in the Central Texas region traditionally have
relied upon the changing morphologies of projectile points as indicators of
temporal periodicity and geographic distribution of cultural expressions.
While this approach may not be the most desirable, investigations of stratified
sites in the region have shown consistently that projectile points are indeed
sensitive and reliable chronological indicators.
Despite a long and relatively well established projectile point sequence,
controversies center upon differing interpretations of how successive prehistoric manifestations should be characterized in terms of regional developmental stages and recognizable periodicity. An attempt is made to briefly review
the development of Central Texas chronological constructs and the controversies surrounding certain parts of the chronologies as they are used in the
current literature. This review is followed by a suggested chronological construct which is intended to provide a basis for the logical discussion and comparison of successive cultural manifestations in the Central Texas archeological region.

Texas Archeological Society

Development of Chronologies
Beginning with Pearce (1932:49), a succession of increasingly complex
chronological schemes were proposed, used, discarded, or modified as new
archeological evidence became available. Some proposed schema, such as
that of Sayles (1935:52-53), were discarded because they were too cumbersome. Others, such as Kelley (1947a, 1947b, 1959), persist but have been
modified substantially.
A comprehensive cultural and chronological framework based upon the
Midwestern Taxonomic System (McKern, 1939:301-313) was presented by
Suhm et al. (1954:16-21). Widely used for a short time, this scheme was
replaced by a modification based on four developmental stages. In the revised
version, the Archaic Stage was divided into Early, Middle, Late, and Transitional; the Neo-American Stage was divided into two formal foci (Austin and
Toyah) in keeping with the 1954 scheme; the Paleoindian and Historic stages
were left intact (Johnson et al., 1962:117-124).
The Austin and Toyah foci are separable and chronologically distinct as
conclusively demonstrated at the Kyle Site (Jelks, 1962:84-99). Still searching for a better and more manageable way to handle the stratified occupations
in Central Texas, Sorrow et al. (1967:141-145) proposed a series of Local
Phases which were based on the model presented by Willey and Phillips
(1958:22). The sequential divisions provided the first inclusive scheme
which, although terminology may differ, has had the least modification. This
scheme represents a significant achievement in the sense of obtaining a grasp
upon clearly demonstrable sequential occupations over a long period of time.
To some degree, cultural chronologies proposed after 1947 and before
1972 relied upon a four stage division of cultural manifestations. The division
is based jointly upon the systems presented by McKern (1939) and Willey and
Phillips (1958). These developmental stages were termed the Paleo-American, Archaic, Neo-American, and Historic (Suhm et al., 1954:16-21). However, Sollberger and Hester (1972:326-327) proposed a fifth developmental
stage which they termed the pre-Archaic; this stage was envisioned as a transitional period following the Paleoindian and preceding the Archaic Stage.
Shortly thereafter, Weir (1976) reviewed the Central Texas Archaic in detail. Rather than use the concept of the pre-Archaic, he presented a sequence
of phases similar to that employed by Sorrow et al. (1967:Fig. 72). Weir
(1976) took the scheme for the Archaic subdivisions a step further and proposed formal phase names for five chronological divisions. He recognized
these divisions on the basis of projectile point styles, certain other tool forms,
and occurrence of features such as burned rock middens. Prewitt (in press,
ms) divided the Archaic phases proposed by Weir (1976) into two phases
each; in addition, a phase encompassing the late Paleoindian manifestations
was proposed.
An attempt by Jelks (1978) to revamp the Central Texas chronology was
not successful in that other workers have not used his proposed model. However, his concept of projectile point series and placement of the Central Texas
region into a larger interregional scheme should certainly be considered carefully.

The Archaic versus the pre-Archaic
The origin and development of the use of the term Archaic to denote a
cultural stage characterized by hunting and gathering exploitive strategies was
summarized by Willey and Phillips (1958:104-111). In Central Texas, the
term became firmly entrenched upon the publication of An Introductory
Handbook of Texas Archeology (Suhm et al., 1954) ; as defined, the Archaic
"bridges the time between Paleo-American nomadic hunting people on the
one hand, and the settled agricultural, pottery-making Indians on the other"
(Suhm et al., 1954:18). Their definition of the Archaic as a hunting and
gathering adaptation (or stage of cultural development) closely parallels the
later definitions provided by Willey and Phillips (1958).
Archeologists have viewed the Archaic Stage as both a cultural and chronological construct which sets apart hunting and gathering peoples from their
predecessors who were more dependent upon big game procurement strategies (Paleoindian Stage); and from their successors (in some regions) who
developed sedentary agricultural exploitive strategies (Neo-American Stage).
Despite a variety of chronological problems, the concept of the Archaic as a
developmental stage has been used effectively in Central Texas. Although
resolution appears to be the intent, introduction of the term pre-Archaic to
denote a 2,500 year long transition from Paleoindian to fully developed Archaic (Sollberger and Hester 1972:327) does not resolve problems surrounding early chronological successions in the Central Texas region.
Based on Caldwell (1958:8-11), Sollberger and Hester’s (1972:327) conception of the pre-Archaic is that "... it represents a transitory period following the late Paleo-lndian occupations and predates the beginning of the local
Archaic traditions." They (Sollberger and Hester, 1972:340) equate the preArchaic with the duration of an Altithermal period in the Lower Pecos region
as proposed by Bryant and Larson (1968:57-70). Bryant and Shafer
(1977:15-18) do not formally label that period as Altithermal in later discussions of the Lower Pecos paleoenvironment.
Conflicting interpretations emerge from the chronological and terminological overlap of the pre Archaic with the early Archaic San Geronimo and Clear
Fork phases. Weir (1976:119) sees the San Geronimo Phase as an Archaic
adaptation. But, it is one which precedes the development of an intensive
exploitive strategy which resulted in the accumulation of large mounds of
thermally fractured limestone cobbles. Characteristic projectile points include
Bell, Gower, and Uvalde types as well as a series of untyped early barbed
points. Weir (1976:127) includes early triangular forms (illustrated by
Sollberger and Hester, 1972) in the Clear Fork Phase. This phase follows the
San Geronimo Phase and marks the beginning of burned rock midden accumulation.
The pre-Archaic of Sollberger and Hester (1972) is proposed as a transitional period which encompasses both the San Geronimo Phase and part of
the Clear Fork Phase. In view of continuing efforts to isolate more discrete
episodes of human occupation in the region, the pre-Archaic seems a less
desirable concept than does shorter duration phases representing Archaic
adaptations.

Texas Archeological Society

The Neo-American versus the Late Prehistoric and other
Designations
Following coinage of the term Neo-American (Suhm et al., 1954:13), a
series of terms have been used to denote those cultures which succeeded the
basic defined Archaic. These cultures adopted the bow and arrow in preference to the atlatl, began to manufacture ceramics, and in some regions, developed an agriculturally based subsistence. Frequently used interchangeably, these terms include Neo-lndian (Hughes and Willey, 1978), Late
Prehistoric (Hester and Parker, 1970), and Post-Archaic (Prewitt, 1974).
Each of these terms possesses certain merit in that they denote a distinct
technological shift. However, the terms are used as identifiers for a chronological period which differs in the developmental stages represented in various regions. For example, any of these four terms could be used as an identifier for the agriculturally based Caddoan groups in the East Texas region or for
the nonagriculturally based bow and arrow using groups in the Lower Pecos
region. This usage seems inappropriate since the terms are applied to a Formative Stage of development (in the sense of Willey and Phillips, 1958:144147) in the East Texas region and an Archaic Stage of development (bow and
arrow present, but hunting and gathering adaptation without agriculture) in
the Lower Pecos region.
In order that this type of contradiction be eliminated, E. Mott Davis (Prewitt
and Nance, 1980:3-4) suggested that the term Neoarchaic be used to identify
those cultures wherein ceramics and/or the bow and arrow were adopted but
in which agriculture was never practiced or in which agriculture did not
emerge as a dominant economic pattern. It is proposed that the term Neoarchaic be applied to the Central Texas archeological region and that it be used
specifically to identify the Austin and Toyah phases of Central Texas.
The Neoarchaic is envisioned as a variant of the Archaic. It distinguishes
hunting and gathering cultures which adopted the bow and arrow, but never
adopted agriculture, from cultures which achieved a Formative Stage of development. Further, the term is proposed on the assumption that the technological changes which occurred appear not to have made a basic difference in
the general subsistence base.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY MODEL
Several sources (McKern, 1939; Krieger, 1953; Suhm et al., 1954; Willey
and Phillips, 1958) were used from which to derive concepts and a model of
regional relationships within which a modified chronological scheme may be
constructed. Definitions are taken from these sources with minor modifications:
Stage:

A segment of cultural-historical development which, in a given

area, may be characterized by a dominant economic pattern.
A chronologically and spatially limited cultural manifestation which
possesses sufficient traits to distinguish it from all other similarly
conceived units.
Component: An expression of a Phase at a single site; a Component may compose all or part of a site.
Phase:

Prewitt -- Cultural Chronology

Site:

69

A specific spatially definable locus which contains evidence of human occupation or use.

The model accepts the basic cultural-historical development concept presented by Willey and Phillips (1958:61-78) wherein specific stages of development are not dependent on time. Chronologic placement and extent of
any stage may be expected to vary from region to region. For any developmental stage within any region, it is presumed that a set of chronologically
significant cultural expressions (phases) is definable. Figure 1 illustrates this
model of regional relationships.
Recent arguments regarding chronological constructs deal with the utility,
necessity, composition, and terminological inconsistencies inherent in this
type of approach (Dunnell, 1971; Cook, 1976:1-4; Stoltman, 1978:703711). The need for regional chronologies is recognized by these writers, but
an agreement does not exist regarding an acceptable approach to the derivation of chronologies.
The dimensional phase of Cook (1976:3) expands upon the Willey and
Phillips (1958) definition of a phase. Although not clearly defined, a dimensional phase must meet two requirements:
(1) that the definition of each phase bein terms of a number of dimensions such as
style, technology, structure of segmentation, adaptation, trade, mortuary pracrices, and human biology rather than in terms of several distinctive artifact types or
a stage name; (2) that the various dimensions of each phase be directly comparable, so that analogous parts of hunting and gathering, horticultural, and agricultural societies can be directly compared. (Cook 1976:3).
This concept of a dimensional phase closely parallels the intent of phase as
used in this argument. However, it is contended that phases can be recognized on the basis of key index markers; once these sets of traits are identified,
then specific sites can be investigated in such a manner that the dimensional
aspects can be examined and defined. Cook’s (1976) dimensions are observable cultural traits in the same category as artifact styles; the relationships of
the aggregate of observed data within a given episode of occupation are the
elements necessary to understanding the lifestyles of prehistoric peoples.
It does not matter whether one labels classes of data as traits, types, styles,
or dimensions. The important point is to isolate an episode in time, define the
internal composition and relationships of the episode, and explain the cultural
system represented by the episode. Similar episodes with similar expressions
within a limited geographic area can then be classed as a phase, both in the
sense of Willey and Phillips (1958) and the modifications proposed by Cook
(1976). The full configuration of a phase need not be defined before that
phase is recognized, and key index markers are essential for such recognition.
A very real problem in dealing with the cultural-historical development
model is the misuse, through borrowing, of terms used in the model by archeologists without an evolutionary perspective of culture history. For example, Hester (1980:28-31) presents a Willey and Phillips (1958) derived definition of Paleoindian, Archaic, and Formative stages, then labels these as
periods rather than as developmental stages.
Such practice is contradictory to the meanings of stage and period as concisely expressed by Krieger (1953:247). He defines a stage as a segment of a
historical sequence in a given area which is characterized by a dominant

economic pattern and can be recognized regardless of the existence of known
dates. A period is defined as dependent upon specific chronology. As stated
by Krieger (1953:247):
¯ . . a stage may be recognized by content alone, and, in the event that accurate
dates can be obtained for it in a given area, it could be said that the stage here
existed during such-and-such a period. Further, the same stage may be said to
appear at different times or periods in different areas ....................

The proposed model is viewed as a tool which achieves the second of three
levels of scientific archeological analysis identified by Willey and Phillips
(1958:4). From lower to higher, these levels are: observation, description;
and explanation. It is intended that the descriptive treatment of observed
characteristics should serve as a basis from which meaningful explanations
can be derived.
The achievement of the chronological construct is not seen as an end in and
of itself; rather, it is the basis from which interpretations of cultural processes
can be achieved. Precise chronological control is merely a necessary step
which is required before explanation is possible. Further, explanation must
begin at the component, or specific, level and progress to more inclusive
levels of generalization. The proposed cultural-historical model provides a
system of controls from which such explanations may be achieved.

PROPOSED CENTRAL TEXAS CHRONOLOGY
Cultural chronologies are useful only so long as they contribute to the
understanding of past human lifeways. The primary purpose of regional
chronologies should be to identify discrete episodes of cultural expressions in
order to facilitate definition of adaptations as they change through time. It is
emphasized that chronologies should be developed on a regional basis. However, it should be expected that geographical boundaries of specific episodes
of adaptation will fluctuate within a given region. In other words, adaptive
mode A may encompass a more limited geographic extent than the succeeding adaptive mode B. As a whole, however, a series of adaptations may be
expected within a definable region.
Central Texas is the specific region under consideration. This region (Fig.
2) encompasses the eastern half of the Edwards Plateau, the Llano Uplift,
most of the Lampasas Cut Plains, the Comanche Plateau, the southern end
of the Grand Prairie, and the Blackland Prairies bordering the Balcones Escarpment from near Waco to near Uvalde.
Based upon the model (Fig. 1), it is possible to suggest a detailed chronological construct for the Central Texas archeological region. Available evidence indicates that four major stages of development are present and recognizable: Paleoindian, Archaic, Neoarchaic, and Historic. Three stages
proposed by Willey and Phillips (1958), the Formative, Classic, and PostClassic, are not included in this regional chronology. Archeological evidence
to support the existence of these stages in the Central Texas region is absent.
Problems exist with the term Paleoindian (Willey and Phillips, 1958:80).
However, in view of the entrenched nature of the term’s acceptance and use,
it is retained to denote those cultures which were oriented toward big game
procurement; food collecting was not the overriding economic pursuit. The
Paleoindian Stage has been stereotyped (somewhat erroneously) as a migratory systematic big game procurement adaptation (Johnson, 1977:65-77).
Identifiable remains of the Paleoindian Stage in Central Texas are sparse
and limited in large part to single occurrences. Segmentation of the Stage at
this time would be spurious. The discovery and investigation of more sites on
the order of 41BX52 should contribute to a better understanding of the Paleoindian stage in Central Texas (Jerry Henderson, personal communication). This site contained a distinct, isolatable component that yielded Folsom
points and related camping debris.
The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas. The Archaic is a term used to denote hunting and gathering (or food collecting)
cultures. Eleven phases are recognizable in the Archaic expressions in Central
Texas; each phase is assigned a formal name. Some of the phase names are
taken from Kelley (1947a), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (in press); the remainder are new terms taken from towns or communities in the Central Texas
region.
Phase distinctions are based on data from numerous sites but primarily
drawn from Johnson et al. (1962), Shafer (1963), Sorrow et al. (1967), Weir
(1976), Wesolowsky et al. (1976), and Prewitt (ms). From oldest to
youngest, proposed phases are: Circleville, San Geronimo, Jarrell, Oakalla,

Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, Round Rock, San Marcos, Uvalde, Twin Sisters,
and Driftwood.
An entrenched tendency exists in the literature dealing with Central Texas
in which the Archaic Stage is subdivided into periods which are cited as early,
middle, late, transitional, terminal, etc. The concept of formal periods is rejected in favor of the simplified component/phase/stage approach. However, it is not necessarily undesirable to maintain informal reference to generalized periodicity within the Archaic Stage as it developed in Central Texas. It
is strongly emphasized that these generalizations are informal and not considered to be part of the formal chronological model. They are stated for the sole
purpose of providing continuity with the previous terminology.
The first four phases (Circleville, San Geronimo, Jarrell, and Oakalla) fall
within what was previously termed Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic; the
second four (Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, Round Rock, and San Marcos) fall
within the Middle Archaic; and the last three phases (Uvalde, Twin Sisters,
and Driftwood) fall within the Late Archaic.
The Archaic begins with an apparently thinly distributed population in the
Circleville Phase. A broadly based hunting and gathering adaptation emerges
wherein there is a strong orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than
the hunting. A proliferation of projectile point styles suggests small dispersed
bands which roamed over relatively large geographical areas. This tendency
continues through the San Geronimo and Jarrell phases, but begins to alter in
the Oakalla Phase.
A less diffuse gathering economy emerges in the relatively short lived
Oakalla Phase. Burned rock middens appear and noticeably less diversity
exists in projectile point forms. These factors suggest a trend toward greater
specialization in food gathering and a greater interaction between groups in
the region.
An intensification of specialized food gathering continues into the Clear
Fork Phase when burned rock middens emerge as a dominant feature of the
Central Texas region. While there is still unquestionable diversity in the foods
collected, the burned rock middens attest to the increasing importance of
resource specific, intensive, vegetal (?) food processing. Concomitant with
this specialization, an increase occurs in terms of the ratio of projectile points
to other tools. Projectile points represent roughly 50% of the tools present.
This ratio seems to indicate that a balance is achieved in terms of exploitation
of both plant and animal resources.
An increase in population is indicated in that site frequency increases. This
increase is to be expected when a higher level of exploitation efficiency is
achieved. This trend continues through the Marshall Ford Phase and reaches
a peak of development in the Round Rock Phase. In the succeeding San
Marcos Phase, there seems to be a decrease in the intensity of burned rock
midden accumulation, a slight decrease in the importance of hunting, and a
tendency toward a more generalized gathering subsistence base.
This pattern is carried over into the Uvalde Phase. Burned rock midden
accumulations generally cease in the eastern part of Central Texas, although
they seem to persist in the western portions of the region. Bison are present in
the region during this phase. These animals appear to represent an important

74

Texas Archeological Society

economic resource, although a pattern of heavy dependence on bison procurement does not seem to have developed. Rather, there appears more of a
well balanced diversity of resources exploited which was not overly dependent on any given resource. A proliferation of projectile point styles occurs
which may indicate another episode of dispersed bands which roamed widely
over the region.
A coalescence of intensive, broadly based exploitation heavily oriented
toward gathering appears to occur during the Twin Sisters Phase. A proliferation of specialized tool types other than projectile points suggests an efficient
system of food collecting. A marked decrease in the importance of hunting is
implied in a low ratio of projectile points to other tools. This pattern continues
through the Driftwood Phase which represents the end of the Archaic Stage
occupations in the Central Texas region.
The Neoarchaic Stage follows the Archaic. It is differentiated primarily on
the basis of the appearance of arrow points, ceramics, and cemeteries. The
basic exploitive strategies do not appear to differ significantly from the preceding Archaic Stage. However, evidence exists which suggests that bison hunting became quite important during the later part of the Neoarchaic. Two
phases are recognized in the Neoarchaic of Central Texas: Austin and Toyah
(Jelks, 1962:84-99).
The Austin Phase continues the same trend as was present in the Driftwood
Phase of the Archaic. The emphasis seems to be on gathering a balanced
variety of plant foods rather than on hunting, although a slight increase occurs
in the overall importance of hunting. Another important facet of the Austin
Phase is the widespread appearance of true cemeteries.
Cemeteries carry over into the succeeding Toyah Phase, but the subsistence base shifts dramatically. Bison once again are present. The economy is
oriented heavily toward bison procurement to the point that hunting appears
to be of equal importance once more to gathering. In addition, ceramics and a
variety of flaked lithic tools oriented toward bison processing a~pear. The
occasional presence of corn cobs suggest that either the Toyah Phase peoples
actively traded with agricultural peoples; or they practiced a mixed hunting,
gathering, and nomadic horticultural subsistence pattern.
The Historic Stage follows the Neoarchaic. It is characterized by the intrusion of and subsequent domination by Europeans and European derived
economic practices and the adoption of European material culture items by
aboriginal inhabitants. Specific phases or periods probably will be recognized
and defined at some point in the future. Figure 3 illustrates the proposed
chronological scheme for the Central Texas region. The time scale is derived
from Prewitt (in press, ms; Nance, ms).

in the following discussion. These discussions are summaries and additional
research should provide more detailed data for each. Not all known components of each phase are discussed; representative components are listed in
order to provide a general set of references.
Regionally specific cultural chronologies are useful if they contribute to an
understanding of past human lifeways. The proposed scheme was developed
on the premise that it is flexible and will be modified as new data become
available. In order to accomplish the objective of understanding past events in
Central Texas, the proposed chronology should be used only within the region for which it is intended to apply. Separate, similar schemes should be
constructed for adjacent regions (such as the Lower Pecos and South Texas)
in order to facilitate interregional comparisons.
Only the named proposed phases are discussed. The Archaic and Neoarchaic stages are included, but Paleoindian and Historic stages are omitted.
With the former, a detailed examination of specific adaptations within that
stage awaits accumulation of more precise data. With the latter, segmentation
into phases at this stage of archeological knowledge of the region is not warranted.

Archaic Stage
CIRCLEVILLE PHASE
(Prewitt, in press; Patterson, 1977)
Representative Components: Levi Rockshelter (41TV49; Alexander, 1963); Loeve
(41WM133; Eddy, 1973; Prewitt, ms); Tombstone Bluff (41WM165; Prewitt, ms); Strohacker
(41KR29; Sollberger and Hester, 1972); Granite Beach (41LL2; Crawford, 1965).
Site Types: rockshelter; point bar; bluff top; terrace.
Representative Artifacts: Angostura, Golondrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff projectile points;
Clear Fork gouges; miscellaneous bifaces; drills; scrapers; gravers; hammerstones; grooved
stones (?); grinding stones; bone awls; carved bones.
Features: large and medium basin shaped, stone lined fire hearths; burned clay/charcoal pits;
mussel shell concentrations.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering with an emphasis on gathering; plant food processing
indicated by grinding stones; freshwater mussels collected~ deer and other small game hunted.
External Relations: This phase represents a regional expression of a widespread adaptation
which occurred following the disappearance of Paleoindian lifeways. In the adjacent Lower
Pecos region, a concurrent expression occurred with Golondrina projectile points the dominant
key index marker. While these two areas undoubtedly are related during this phase, the overall
material culture assemblage is varied sufficiently to warrant separation of the two regions.
Estimated Age: ca 8500 B.P. to 7000 B.P. (ca 6550 B.C. to 5050 B.C.)
Discussion: The Circleville Phase continues the Paleoindian style of lithic tool production in
terms of flaking techniques and projectile point morphology. The subsistence base, however, is
Archaic in that it is a hunting and gathering adaptation. For this reason, the phase is considered to
be the earliest Archaic expression in Central Texas.
Selected References: Alexander (1963)~ Crawford (1965); Sollberger and Hester (1972);
Eddy (1973); Prewitt (ms).
SAN GERONIMO PHASE (Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: San Geronimo (41BX196; Weir, 1976); Youngsport
(41BL78; Shafer, 1963)~ Granite Beach (41LL2); Tombstone Bluff (41WM165).

78

Texas Archeological Society

Site Types: terrace; bluff top.
Representative Artifacts: Gower, Hoxie, and Wells projectile points; Clear Fork gouges;
Guadalupe gouges; miscellaneous bifaces; scrapers.
Features: data unclear; possibly large and medium basin shaped, stone lined hearths at
Granite Beach.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering; available data too sparse to allow detailed statements on
specific adaptive orientations.
External Relations: It is relatively localized to the Central Texas Region although a similar
expression was noted in the Lower Pecos region at Devils Rockshelter (41VV264; Prewitt,
1966).
Estimated Age: 7000 B.P. to ca 6000 B.P. (5050 B.C. to ca 4050 B.C.)
Discussion: Although some Paleoindian lithic traits persist (particularly edge grinding and
occasional parallel flaking of projectile points), projectile point morphology differs strongly from
the preceding Circleville Phase. The subsistence base appears to be Archaic although the paucity
of available data preclude detailed examination.
Selected References: Shafer (1963); Crawford (1965); Weir (1976); Prewitt (ms).

JARRELL PHASE
(new name; Sorrow et al., 1967)
Representative Components: Landslide (41BL85; Sorrow et al., 1967); Gault (41WM10;
TARL); Site 41VT17 (Fox and Hester, 1976); Tombstone Bluff (41WM165); Merrell (41WM2;
Campbell, 1948); La Jita (41UV21; Hester, 1971); Jetta Court (41TV151; Wesolowsky et al.,
1976).
Site Types: terrace and bluff top,
Representative Artifacts: Andice, Bell, Martindale, and Uvalde projectile points; Clear Fork
gouges; miscellaneous bifaces; scrapers; hammerstones; grinding stones.
Features: large fiat hearths.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering with a probable tendency for an emphasis on gathering;
bison present and used as a food source although hunting probably not dominant; freshwater
mussels collected for food.
External Relations: This phase appears to be relatively localized to the general Central Texas
region except that Martindale dart points (and slight variants of the type) also occur in the Lower
Pecos Region. Andice and Bell types possibly are related to the same tradition represented by the
morphologically similar Calf Creek type in northeastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and
southwestern Missouri (Perino, 1968:14-15).
Estimated Age: ca 6000 B.P. to 5000 B.P (ca 4050 B.C. to 3050 B.C.)
Discussion: Some holdovers exist from the Paleoindian lithic tradition, with frequent edge
grinding on Martindale and Uvalde points and flaking reminiscent of that tradition on Andice
points. Subsistence is thoroughly Archaic and probably tends toward an emphasis on gathering.
Selected References: Campbell (1948); Sorrow et al. (1967); Fox and Hester (1976); WesoIowsky et al. (1976); Prewitt (ms.)

OAKALLA PHASE
(new name; Sorrow et al., 1967)
Representative Components: Landslide (41BL85); John Ischy (41WM49; Sorrow, 1969);
McCann (41LM3; Preston, 1969); La Jita (41UV21); Greenhaw (41HY29; Weir, 1979);
Tombstone Bluff (41WM165); Shep (41KR109; Luke, 1980); Wounded Eye (41KR107; Luke,
1980).
Site Types: terrace; bluff top.
Representative Artifacts: Baird and Taylor projectile points; Clear Fork gouges.
Features: burned rock middens; large fiat hearths; medium basin hearths.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering; however, paucity of isolated components hampers a
detailed examination of subsistence base; diagnostic projectile points rarely occur in relatively

Prewitt - Cultural Chronology

79

large numbers (Greenhaw is an exception); significant accumulations of fire cracked rocks appear to coincide with this phase (beginnings of burned rock middens) and suggests that plant food
collecting and processing important; freshwater mussels apparently collected.
External Relations: While diagnostic projectile points generally are more prevalent in Central
Texas, they also are known to occur in East Texas (e.g., George C. Davis). The many varieties of
the morphologically similar Tortugas projectile point which occur in the South Texas region may
indicate some relations with that area, although Tortugas seems to occur later in time.
Estimated Age: 5000 B.P. to ca 4600 B.P. (3050 B.C. to ca 2650 B.C.)
Discussion: The Oakalla Phase is probably the least well defined of the Central Texas phases.
This situation is due to a general lack of stratigraphically isolatable components. This lack may be
a reflection of the apparently short duration of the phase (ca 400 years).
Selected References: Hester (1971); Sorrow (1969); Sorrow et al. (1967); Preston (1969);
Luke (1980); Prewitt (ms).

CLEAR FORK PHASE (Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: Williams (41TV75; Suhm, 1959); Crumley (41TV86; Kelly,
1961); McCann (41LM3); Greenhaw (41HY29); Rogers Springs (41TV39; Prewitt, in press).
Site Types: terrace; upland.
Representative Artifacts: Nolan and Travis projectile points; Clear Fork gouges; bifaces;
scrapers; strangulated scrapers; grinding stones.
Features: burned rock middens.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: relatively even balance between hunting and gathering emerged during this
phase; burned rock middens appear to accumulate rapidly and indicates extensive plant food
processing; however, relatively large numbers of projectile points indicate that hunting also quite
important with frequency of dart points being roughly equal to frequency of all other tools.
External relations: Diagnostic projectile point styles are concentrated relatively within the
Central Texas region. However, these styles occur infrequently in the Lower Pecos region. An
extension in range to the northwest is indicated by the presence of these styles of dart points into
the general Abilene area.
Estimated Age: ca 4600 B.P. to 4000 B.P. (ca 2650 B.C. to 2050 B.C.)
Discussion: The burned rock midden tradition is well established during this phase; the
general subsistence pattern which prevails during the next two phases is set.
Selected References: Suhm (1959); Kelly (1961); Preston (1969); Weir (1979); Prewitt (in
press).

MARSHALL FORD PHASE
(new name; Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: Crumley (41TV86); Rogers Springs (41TV39); John Ischy
(41WM49); McCann (41LM3); Evoe Terrace (41BL104; Sorrow et al., 1967); Wunderlich
(41CM3; Johnson et al., 1962); Youngsport (41BL78).
Site Types: terrace; upland; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Bulverde projectile points; bifaces; unifaces; grinding stones.
Features: burned rock middens.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: relatively balanced hunting and gathering system similar to preceding Clear Fork
Phase.
External Relations: This phase primarily is confined to the Central Texas region although
Bulverde type dart points occur occasionally in East Texas (Suhm and Jelks, 1962).
Estimated Age: 4000 B.P. to ca 3400 B.P. (2050 B.C. to ca 1450 B.C.)
Discussion: This phase primarily is associated with burned rock midden sites. However,
sparse materials from this phase do occur in rockshelters such as the Oblate site (41CM1; Johnson et al., 1962). There does not seem to be any dramatic shift toward the occupation of rockshelters which would indicate a significant change in camping habits.
Selected References: Kelly (1961); Weir (1979); Sorrow (1969); Preston (1969); Johnson et
al. (1962); Prewitt (in press).

ROUND ROCK PHASE (Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: Williams (41TV75); Crumley (41TV86); Greenhaw
(41HY29); John Ischy (41WM49); Youngsport (41BL78); Rogers Springs (41TV39); LoeveFox (41WM230; Prewitt, 1974, ms).
Site Types: terrace, upland; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Pedernales projectile points, bifaces; unifaces; grinding stones.
Features: burned rock middens; medium and small basin hearths~ burned clay/charcoal
lenses and pits~ lithic debris concentrations.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: relatively balanced hunting and gathering system which follows in the tradition of
the preceding two phases; plant food processing indicated by burned rock middens; freshwater
mussel shells collected as food source; roughly equal ratio of projectile points to all other tools
indicates importance of hunting in the economy.
External Relations: While this phase primarily is restricted to the Central Texas region, the key
index marker (Pedernales projectile points) occurs to the northwest into the Abilene area and to
the southwest into the Lower Pecos region (Suhm and Jelks, 1962). Sparsely distributed examples of Pedernales also occur on the coastal plain to the south and southeast of the primary
distribution area.
Estimated Age: ca 3400 B.P. to 2600 B.P. (ca 1450 B.C. to 650 B.C.)
Discussion: This phase appears to represent the peak of burned rock midden use on the
Edwards Plateau and associated physiographic regions. There is not such a domination of the
region in terms of quantities of a single projectile point style and frequency of site occurrence at
any other time during the Archaic of Central Texas. Burned rock midden sites have been the
focus of investigations into this phase. Recent discovery of stratified Round Rock Phase components at Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms) provides a glimpse of activities not associated with a burned
rock midden.
At Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms), Round Rock Phase hearths (medium and small stone lined
basins) are surrounded by burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits, lithic debris concentrations, and
other scattered debris such as burned rocks, freshwater mussel shells, and tools. Spatial distribution of these features and materials provides support for the hypothesis that the middens represent the accumulated debris from hundreds or thousands of disrupted hearths. Presence of dense
lithic debris concentrations also provides an explanation of the tremendous quantities of flaking
debris frequently encountered in middens.
Selected References: Suhm (1959); Kelly (1961); Weir (1979); Sorrow (1969); Shafer
(1963)~ Prewitt (in press, ms).

SAN MARCOS PHASE (Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: Crumley (41TV86); La Jita (41UV21); Evoe Terrace
(41BLI04); John Ischy (41WM49); Youngsport (41BL78); Loeve-Fox (41WM230).
Site Types: terrace; upland; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Marshall, Williams, and Lange projectile points~ bifaces; scrapers;
small concave unifaces; grinding stones; marine shell ornaments.
Features: burned rock middens; large flat hearths; medium and small basin hearths; lithic
debris concentrations; freshwater mussel shell concentrations.
Mortuary Practices: single cremation at Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms); cremation secondary in that
body was burned, then remains interred in a small basin shaped pit.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering with a probable slight emphasis on gathering~ freshwater
mussels collected for food~ slight decrease in ratio of projectile points to other tools indicates that
hunting not as important as in preceding phases~ burned rock middens a continuation of the
established pattern of intensive plant food processing.
External Relations: Distribution of the key index marker for this phase (Marshall dart points)
has a broad range which extends beyond the Central Texas region. However, the most intensive
occurrence of this type and its two companions (Williams and Lange) is within the region. Presence of marine shell ornaments indicates contact, probably through an extensive trade network,
with peoples or resources from a coastal environment.
Estimated Age: 2600 B.P. to ca 2250 B.P. (650 B.C. to ca 300 B.C.)

Prewitt -- Cultural Chronology

81

Discussion: This phase appears to represent the end of significant burned rock midden accumulation over most of the Central Texas region. Ring and crescent middens may continue in use
into later phases in the western portions of the region. Practices which lead to the accumulation of
these features in general wane during the San Marcos Phase. It is probable that bison once again
appear in the region either during this phase or in the succeeding Uvalde Phase.
Selected References: Shafter (1963); Kelly (1961); Hester (1971); Sorrow (1969); Sorrow et
al. (1967); Prewitt (ms).

UVALDE PHASE (new name; Kelley, 1947a)
Representative Components: Wunderlich (41CM3); Oblate (41CM1; Johnson et al., 1962);
Youngsport (41BL78); Crumley (41TV86); Evoe Terrace (41BL104); John Ischy (41WM49);
Jetta Court (41TV151); Scorpion Cave (41ME7; Highley et al., 1978); La Jita (41UV21);
McCann (41LM3).
Site Types: terrace~ upland; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Castroville, Marcos, and Montell projectile points; bifaces; unifaces;
grinding stones; ulna flakers.
Features: data lacking.
Mortuary Practices: data lacking.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering with a probable slight emphasis on gathering; freshwater
mussels collected (not in large quantities); grinding stones indicate continued processing of plant
foods; bison present in region during this phase but not a primary food source.
External Relations: The key index markers for this phase (Castroville, Marcos, and Montell
dart points) also occur as horizon markers in the adjacent Lower Pecos region to the west (Dibble,
1967; Prewit~, 1970). A possibility exists that this phase represents a more widespread adaptation. Marine shell artifacts noticeably are lacking and indicates a discontinuation of the earlier
apparent trade system.
Estimated Age: ca 2250 B.P. to 1750 B.P. (ca 300 B.C. to A.D. 200)
Discussion: Artifacts diagnostic of this phase are found frequently in upper portions of burned
rock middens; middens apparently did not accumulate during this phase. A tendency exists for
diagnostic materials to occur adjacent to middens and in terraces which lack burned rock middens. This situation, in combination with the trend toward an emphasis on gathering, suggests
that intensive processing which earlier led to midden formation is not practiced and a different
adaptation existed.

TWIN SISTERS PHASE (Weir, 1976)
Representative Components: Oblate (41CM1); Wunderlich (41CM3); Williams (41TV75);
Youngsport (41BL78); Evoe Terrace (41BL104)~ La Jita (41UV21)~ Scorpion Cave (41ME7);
McCann (41LM3); Penny Winkle (41BL23; Shafer et al., 1964); Hoxie Bridge (41WM103;
Bond, 1978); Loeve-Fox (41WM230).
Site Types: terrace; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Ensor projectile points; Erath and San Gabriel bifaces; Clear Fork
gouges; perforators; gravers; large and small concave unifaces; scrapers; crushers; grinding
stones; boatstones; stone and marine shell gorgets~ freshwater shell pendants.
Features: large, medium, and small basin hearths; arcuate hearths~ burned clay/charcoal
lenses and pits; mussel shell caches.
Mortuary Practices: isolated flexed burials.
Subsistence: hunting and gathering with a decided emphasis on gathering; projectile points in
low ratio to all other tools; freshwater mussels collected but apparently in lesser quantities than
preceding phases.
External Relations: Ensor dart points are distributed over a much larger area than the Central
Texas region and may represent a more generalized horizon marker. The existence of an extensive trade network is indicated by the occurrence of marine shell artifacts and various stone
objects fashioned from materials which are relatively limited in distribution. The presence of

82

boatstones suggests possible influences from the Southeastern or, less probably, Southwestern
U.S.
Estimated Age: 1750 B~P. to ca 1400 B.P. (A.D. 200 to ca A.D. 550).
Discussion: The Twin Sisters Phase appears to represent the beginning of a distinct tradition.
Emphasis of the hunting and gathering adaptation leans heavily toward gathering rather than
hunting. A proliferation of seemingly formal tool types other than projectile points appears to
reflect a diversified, yet intensive, exploitive system which was probably quite efficient.
Indications of intrasite patterning have been documented at Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms). At least
three episodes of site use during the Twin Sisters Phase were identified. In each episode, patterning is identical and consists of semicircular arrangements of specialized cooking features and
waste debris centered about a large basin hearth. These sets of features and debris are arranged in
a semicircle around other hearths. These latter hearths included at least one large example that
contained items (tool and ornaments) in which particular care had been taken to safeguard and
maintain them. The patterning is interpreted to reflect extended kin (or residence) units arranged
in an encampment much like the historically documented 19th Century Plains Indian groups
(Lowie, 1963:93, Fig. 29).

Features: medium and small basin hearths; burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits.
Mortuary Practices: isolated flexed burials.
Subsistence: appears to be a definite emphasis on the gathering aspect in the basic hunting
and gathering system.
External Relations: in contrast to the preceding Twin Sisters Phase and the following Austin
Phase, there seems to be a lack of exotic materials which suggests an absence of any widespread
trade networks. Distribution of the key index marker (Mahomet dart points) seems to be restricted
to the eastern half of the Central Texas region. This restriction suggests that the western portions
were occupied by peoples more closely affiliated with the Lower Pecos region during this phase.
Estimated Age: ca 1400 B.P. to 1250 B.P. (ca A.D. 550 to A.D. 700).
Discussion: This phase appears to represent a continuation of the tradition established during
the Twin Sisters Phase and signals the end of the Archaic Stage in Central Texas. This is the last
phase during which the atlatl was used. While sparse occupation of rockshelters occurred during
several of the preceding Archaic phases, there seems to be a decided shift toward the occupation
of those types of sites during the Driftwood Phase. This shift represents a noticeable change in the
overall settlement pattern. However, terrace sites still represent the major type of site occupied
during this phase.

Site Types: terrace; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Scallorn and Granbury projectile points; Friday bifaces; miscellaneous bifaces; Clear Fork gouges; scrapers; small concave unifaces; grinding stones; hammerstones; painted pebbles; bone awls; ulna flakers; bone beads; marine shell beads and pendants.
Features: large, medium, and small basin hearths; burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits;
cemeteries.
Mortuary Practices: Cemeteries apparently are preferred although isolated interments may
occur. Both situations occur in terrace sites and rockshelters, usually associated with habitation
sites. Noncremated and cremated interments are present. Noncremated burials usually are
flexed or semiflexed and may be placed on either the right or left side, the back, or stomach
rarely. Cremation appears to have been carried out away from the cemeteries, then charred
remains placed in shallow pits.
At Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms), the noncremated remains were placed in a 3 m diameter circular
area; cremated interments were placed in a 3 m wide band encircling the noncremated burials. A
fence or structure presumedly marked the cemetery locations. Grave goods include marine shell
beads, marine shell pendants, unaltered freshwater mussel shells, antler tines, and cut deer
parietals. Arrow points (Scallorn) frequently are associated; however, most of these specimens
appear to represent the cause of death rather than funeral offerings.
Subsistence: The hunting and gathering system of the two previous phases continues in the
Austin Phase and appears to be more dependent upon gathering. However, a definite slight
increase occurs in the importance of hunting as shown by an increased ratio of projectile points to
all other tools. Whether an increased frequency in the occurrence of deer bones is a reflection of
this trend or the result of differential preservation is unknown. Freshwater mussels continue to be
collected, but in relatively small numbers in comparison to the preceding Archaic phases.
External Relations: The diagnostic projectile point (Scallorn) is very widespread in distribution, extending from central Texas Gulf Coast northward into the Plains region (Bell, 1960;
Chapman, 1980). It is probable that the Central Texas region represents a localized adaptation
within a more generalized pattern. This hypothesis is supported by the apparent presence of an
extensive trade network indicated by frequent occurrence of marine shell artifacts.
Estimated Age: 1250 B.P. to 650 B.P. (A.D. 700 to A.D. 1300).
Discussion: The Austin Phase is placed within the Neoarchaic Stage primarily because of the
change in weaponry from atlatl to bow and arrow. Other changes occur, particularly in regards to
the definite selection of rockshelters as habitation sites and return to a somewhat greater dependence upon hunting. These changes characterize this phase and set it apart as a distinct cultural
expression.

TOYAH PHASE (Jelks, 1962)
Representative Components: Smith Rockshelter (41TV42); Kyle (41H11); Oblate (41CM1);
Penny Winkle (41BL23); Baylor (41ML35); Barker (41WM71; Sorrow, 1970); Berclair
(41GD4; Hester and Parker, 1970); Wheatley (41BCl14); Finis Frost (41SS20; Green and
Hester, 1973); Hoxie Bridge (41WM130); Loeve-Fox (41WM230).
Site Types: terrace; rockshelter.
Representative Artifacts: Perdiz and Cliffton projectile points; Covington bifaces; four bevel
bifaces; end scrapers; drills; grinding stones; freshwater mussel shell pendants~ bone beads~ bone
awls; ulna flakers; various bison bone tools; Leon Plain and Doss Redware ceramics, imported
ceramics; wooden arrow foreshafts~ cane arrow shafts; digging sticks; basketry; cordage; miscellaneous perishable artifacts.
Features: large flat hearths; large and medium basin hearths; burned clay/charcoal lenses;
pits; cemeteries.
Mortuary Practices: Both cemeteries and isolated interments continue in this phase, although
they do not appear to occur as frequently as in the Austin Phase. Semiflexed modes of burial
predominate but cremations also are present. The possible association of grave goods is not
conclusive. Perdiz and Cliffton arrow points frequently associated with the burials appear to
represent aggression which resulted in death rather than funeral offerings.

Subsistence: Although a hunting and gathering system appears to have been practiced during
the Toyah Phase, a radical departure exists from the preceding Austin Phase in several respects.
Perhaps most significant is the presence of bison once again in the Central Texas region. Frequence of bison bone occurrences and definite emphasis on tools which reflect bison procurement, processing, and use suggest that hunting is of equal (or possibly greater) importance than
gathering. This shift is reinforced at such sites as Loeve-Fox (Prewitt, ms) where projectile points
represent 50% of all tools associated with this phase.
The sporadic occurrence of corn cobs in Toyah Phase contexts implies that the subsistence
may have included maize horticulture as a supplement. It is equally possible, however, that these
grains could have been acquired through trade with nearby sedentary groups such as various
Caddoan (including Wichita) groups.
External Relations: The key index markers (Perdiz and Cliffton arrow points) are widespread
in distribution and not restricted to those groups which inhabited the Central Texas region. An
extensive trade system is indicated by the frequent occurrence of Caddoan ceramics in Toyah
Phase sites; presence of corn cobs may indicate trade for foodstuffs. Less certainly, trade with
coastal peoples may be indicated by Goose Creek Plain ceramics at the Smith Rockshelter
(Suhm, 1957) although there appears to be a paucity of marine shell artifacts.
Estimated Age: 650 B.P. to 200 B.P. (A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1750).
Discussion: The Toyah Phase closely follows the Austin Phase in several respects, but most
particularly in terms of settlement pattern, cemetery use, human aggression, and continuation of
a hunting and gathering subsistence system. However, definite changes occurred in terms of: an
emphasis on bison procurement; addition of appropriate tools to the inventory; addition of
ceramics (both imported trade wares and locally manufactured wares); and either addition of
maize horticulture to subsistence system or importation of maize through trade.

ABSTRACT
In the 10 years since a pre-Archaic transitional period between the late Paleoindian and Early
Archaic in Central and Southwestern Texas was postulated by Sollberger and Hester (1972), the
concept has been widely discussed and an increasing amount of data bearing on the problem
gathered. Interpretations of the data have differed, however, on whether the period from 8000
to 5000 years B.P. was transitional or it represented a fully Archaic adaptation following an
earlier transitional period. It also has been suggested the data are incomplete and a judgement on
the problem cannot yet be made. The differing concepts are examined along with distribution
and associations of a number of diagnostic artifacts of the period in the light of paleoenvironmental models.

INTRODUCTION
Interpretations of post Pleistocene cultural adaptations in Central and
Southwest Texas have undergone significant revision in the last 10 years
(Bryant and Shafer, 1977; Patterson, 1977; Prewitt, 1974, in press; Shafer,
1977; Sollberger and Hester, 1972; Weir, 1976a, 1976b). In Central Texas
especially, the growing body of archeological data has permitted more confident discussion of cultural process and chronology (Fig. 1).
Weir (1976a) proposed a five part division of the Archaic in the region,
based on systems theory and subsistence data. This division has gained increasing acceptance, especially for the periods following 4500 B.P. (Prewitt,
1976; Patterson, 1977; Gerstle et al., 1978; Gunn and Mahula, 1977). A
similar analysis for southwestern Texas has not been attempted. However,
Shafer (1976:5-6) notes that changes can be documented through time in
Lower Pecos Archaic point styles.
Very early Holocene adaptations in both areas remain less clear (Story,
1980:10, Bryant and Shafer, 1977:20). Especially open to interpretation is
the nature of the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic strategies of resource
exploitation. The discussion centers on the interval from ca 10,000 years to
ca 5000 years ago.

THE STUDY AREA
The Central Texas Archaic and Lower Pecos Archaic represent distinct
extractive adaptations that are not readily equated. There are, however, reasons to examine concurrently very early adaptations in both areas at a time
when the distinct regional patterns of later periods are not as evident (Story,
1980:15; Gunn and Mahula, 1977:259-260). A number of investigators
(Johnson, 1964:55; Hester, 1971:71-73; Prewitt, 1966:221-224; Sorrow,
1968:21, 28; Sorrow et al., 1967:14; Weir, 1976a:11) recognized that
several projectile point styles recovered in very Early Archaic contexts from
both Central and Southwest Texas corresponded very closely.
Story (1980:15-20) discerned a number of "broad areal artifact clusters"
that may represent interaction spheres on the West Gulf Coastal Plain during
the Early Archaic, from 8000 B.P. to 5000 B.P. The most prominent of
these, which she terms the central cluster, occurs along and on both sides of
the Balcones faultline from north of the Colorado River south and west to the
Lower Pecos region. Story (1980:17) includes Bell County sites (Youngsport
and Landslide) in an eastern areal cluster. However, they are included in the
area of this study because of the resemblances of a good part of their Early
Archaic assemblages to those found farther south and west.
The area thus defined is more limited than that covered by Sollberger and
Hester (1972) in their transitional or pre-Archaic; somewhat broader than
that considered by Story (1980) in the central Early Archaic cluster; and
considerably broader than the San Geronimo Phase of the Central Texas
Archaic defined by Weir (1976a) and expanded upon by Prewitt (in press;
Patterson, 1977:57) (Fig. 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
The Balcones Escarpment (Pass, 1979:113), the heavily eroded southern
and eastern margin of the uplifted Edwards Plateau, is the most prominent
physiographic feature of the area. In Central Texas, the escarpment marks
the boundary between the Texan and Balconian biotic provinces (Blair,
1950; Fig. 3). To the southwest, it forms the boundary of the Balconian and
Tamaulipan provinces to the point in the Amistad region where the Chihuahuan province of Northern Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas intrudes into
southwestern Texas. The Balcones Escarpment has an appreciable effect on
both temperatures and rainfall in both regions (Carr, 1967:20,26; Fig. 3).
The Amistad area presently is far more arid than Central Texas (Carr,
1967:Fig. 2).
The line dividing North America into regions of moisture sufficiency and
moisture deficiency passes through Central Texas (Blair, 1950:93). The 34 in
(863 mm) annual average rainfall isogram (Carr, 1967:20, Fig. 2) closely
parallels the Balcones faultline from the Red River south almost to San Marcos. It swings eastward and roughly parallels the boundary of the Texan and
Tamaulipan biotic provinces. While the bulk of the Texan province lies east of
the line of moisture sufficiency, it is classified as "moist subhumid" (Blair,
1950:100).

Bryant and Shafer (1977) suggested that the regional climatic differences
developed gradually; the arrival of the Postglacial period about 10,000 years
ago did not produce sudden, radical, or uniform changes in regional environments. They postulated that areas of woodland, grasslands, and parklands
were characteristic of Central, Southwest, and West Texas during the Fullglacial period, changing gradually between 14,000 and 10,000 years B.P. to
larger areas of scrub grassland. After 10,000 years B.P., the arid trend proceeded more rapidly and to a greater extreme in Southwest Texas than in
Central Texas.
Others (Story, 1980:Table I; Weir, 1976a:Fig. 4) differ, however, in noting the effects of periods of drought in the region corresponding to the AItithermal of Antevs (1955) or a two drought model proposed by Gunn and
Weir (1976:32, Fig. 2). This latter model is based on evidence of two hot, dry
periods dating from 8000 B.P. to 6000 B.P. and 5000 B.P. to 4000 B.P.,
separated by an interval during which temperatures approached those of the
present. Story (1980:7) suggests that the two drought hypothesis is more

useful than either the gradual change model of Bryant and Shafer (1977) or
the single long drought of Antevs (1955).

THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
Terminology is not the least of the problems in discussing the period from
10,000 B.P. to 4500 B.P. Some of the chronologies and period labels that
have been used are summarized in Table 1. The distinction between the Early
Archaic and Paleoindian periods is somewhat arbitrarily and variably defined.
Story (1980) begins the Early Archaic at about 8000 B.P., approximately the
time late Paleoindian lanceolate points fade from the archeological record.
The distinction between Paleoindian and Archaic was defined in the past
(Suhm at al., 1954; Krieger, 1964; Willey and Phillips, 1958) not only by
differences in projectile points and lithic technology, but by differing subsistence bases. Paleoindian culture was seen to consist of nomadic hunters dependent on specific species of big game; while the Archaic was defined as "the
stage of migratory hunting and gathering cultures continuing into environmental conditions approximating those of the present" (Willey and Phillips,
1958:107). Suhm et al. (1954:18) saw the Archaic as a "bridge" between the
nomadic Paleoindian hunters and settled, pottery making, agricultural societies.
Johnson (1964:92) observed that the Archaic probably did not evolve
from a general Paleoindian type, and that the Paleoindian and Archaic
should be viewed as culture types rather than stages. Bryant and Shafer
(1977) postulated that outside of the High Plains, hunting and gathering was
the primary economic adaptation as early as 12,000 years ago. This initial
prehistoric adaptation, termed early lithic (Shafer, 1977), existed in large
areas of Texas woodlands and parklands between the Plains and Eastern
Woodlands, including Central and Southwest Texas.
A sudden shift from Paleoindian to fully developed Archaic lifeways
seemed unlikely to Sollberger and Hester (1972:327), although they placed
the transition later. They believed the change proceeded slowly, lasting from
8000 B.P. or earlier to 5500 B.P. or later in both Central and Southwest
Texas. The end of the transition coincided with the end of the Altithermal.
Sollberger and Hester (1972) borrowed the term pre-Archaic from
Caldwell (1958:8-11). He used it to refer to a transitory period in the southeastern United States characterized by a highly varied lithic assemblage that
differed from both the preceding and succeeding periods in that area.
Caldwell (1958) believed the assemblage represented a period of highly mobile small bands.
Sollberger and Hester (1972) felt those circumstances were paralleled in
Central and Southwest Texas. In their tentative formulation, they called attention to the diversity in projectile point forms in both areas. These forms
preceded in the archeological record the Early Archaic projectile point types
(Suhm et al., 1954; Suhm and Jelks, 1962). They represent occupations
earlier than the Early Archaic defined in periodizations of the Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962).

McKinney - Paleoindian/Archaic Transition Problem

97

Projectile points referrable to the pre-Archaic in Texas had triangular
blades, expanding stems with slightly concave bases, and exhibited certain
Paleoindian like traits such as parallel flaking and dulled stem edges. Corner
notched, expanding stem points (Gower, Martindale like, and Uvalde like)
characterized the earlier part of this period, while heavily barbed, basally
notched Bell points and a variety of triangular points characterized the later
part.
Small numbers of bifacially and unifacially flaked lithic tools and an occasional grinding slab also were traits of the transitional period. Culturally, the
period was seen to represent the localized continuation of late Paleoindian
lifeways changed only by the introduction of new projectile point styles.
Weir (1976a; 1976b) placed the period within the Archaic. He called it the
San Geronimo Phase, earliest of five postulated Central Texas Archaic
phases (phase used in the sense of Willey and Phillips, 1958:22). He set its
temporal limits from about 8000 B.P. to 4500 B.P. and drew attention to its
continuity with and within the Archaic while not necessarily disputing its developmental nature.
Weir (1976a) saw the Central Texas Archaic phases as periods of stability
reinforced by negative feedback, separated by abrupt periods of disequilibrium. The San Geronimo Phase was defined as "a system of hunting and
gathering that is loosely structured, nonspecialized, and is poorly delimited
spatially" (Weir, 1976a:50). Influences from both east and west are evident in
the San Geronimo. The small, widely scattered sites of the phase are found
on small knolls or terrace remnants.
Unlike Sollberger and Hester (1972), Weir (1976a:50,124) included
Angostura points in the San Geronimo; but like Sollberger and Hester
(1972), he placed Early Barbed, Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde points early
in the phase, Bell and triangular Tortugas points later. San Geronimo tool
types included Clear Fork and Guadalupe gouges, thick triangular and ovate
bifaces, and a variety of trimmed flakes. Late in the San Geronimo, burned
rock accumulations and oval middens appeared along with broad hearths on
flat surfaces.
Prewitt (1974:Fig. 7) tentatively proposed a Central Texas period based on
radiocarbon dates he called "Transitional Early Archaic-Late Paleoindian,"
for which, apparently, Angostura, Martindale, and Gower points were
diagnostic. Later, expanding on Weir’s (1976a) work, Prewitt (1981, in
press) subdivided Central Texas prehistory from the end of the Paleoindian
period through the post Archaic into 13 phases. The first of these, the Circleville Phase (8000 B.P. to 7000 B.P.) is a transitional period that included
the earliest manifestations of Weir’s (1976a) San Geronimo Phase, Archaic
economic adaptations, and late Paleoindian lithics such as Angostura, GoIondrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff points. Circleville is represented by sites
such as Levi (Alexander, 1963) and Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt, 1974).
If the Circleville Phase were to be extended to the Amistad area, it would
include (Prewitt, 1981) components such as the Golondrina occupation at
Baker Cave (Hester, 1979a). Prewitt (1981) further subdivided Weir’s

(1976a) San Geronimo Phase into the San Geronimo (7000 B.P. to 6000
B.P.) and Jarrell (6000 B.P. to 5000 B.P.). Jarrell includes some of the later
manifestations of Weir’s (1976a) San Geronimo Phase. Triangular projectile
points, however, which Prewitt (1981) termed Baird and Taylor after Kelley
(1959) and Sorrow (1969:19) to distinguish them from the more southerly
Tortugas type, are assigned to the subsequent Oakalla Phase (5000 B.P. to
4500 B.P.).
In the Amistad region, Shafer and Bryant (1977) tentatively adapted a
projectile point chronology developed by Collins (1974), placing Baker,
Bandy, and early barbed points in an Early Archaic period (Period B, 9000
B.P. to 6000 B.P.). Golondrina, Angostura, and early stemmed forms were
placed in Period A (before 9000 B.P.) immediately following the Paleoindian
period characterized by Plainview and Folsom points.
The net effect of the past 10 years has been a realignment with the Middle
Archaic of the previously defined Early Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962), which
Weir (1976a, 1976b) termed the Clear Fork Phase; and redefinition of the
term Early Archaic to designate the period proposed by Sollberger and Hester
(1972) as the pre-Archaic (Story, 1980:10-11).

THE SITES
More than 40 sites have yielded evidence of some sort of very Early Archaic
occupation (Table 1). Most are found in or near the transitional zone between
the Edwards Plateau and Gulf Coastal Plain (Story, 1980; Fig. 2). This situation may be a result either of selective attention to the area by archeologists; or
actual differences in aboriginal residence patterns during the Altithermal
droughts.
Principal criteria for selecting sites were diagnostic artifact forms (Table 2).
However, inventories (Table 2) are not meant to imply primary associations
of all artifacts found in each component. Furthermore, distribution of an artifact style, or even of an apparent assemblage, does not necessarily imply a
concomitant distribution of economic strategies (Story, 1980). Differences
through time in diagnostic artifacts do not necessarily imply changes in subsistence adaptations (Bryant and Shafer, 1972:21).

Gower projectile points are among the most pervasive indicators of very
Early Archaic occupations in a large part of Texas. Gower and Gower like
points were reported from at least 20 localities (Table 3, Fig. 3), stretching
from Val Verde County (Devil’s Mouth, Johnson, 1964) in Southwest Texas,
along both sides of the Balcones faultline, to Hood County (Acton site, Blaine
et al., 1968) in Northcentral Texas. Southeastward, Gower points were reported in Victoria County (Fox and Hester, 1976), almost on the coast.
Gower was first proposed as a type by Shafer (1963) at Youngsport, Bell
County. In general appearance, Gower points show a close affiliation with
Archaic projectile points and look like very crude Pedernales points (Shafer,
1963:64). Kelly (1979a: 13) suggested Gower points probably were misclassifted in the past because of their basal similarity to Pedernales. He noted the
poor workmanship of most Gower points. Kelly’s (1979a) conclusion (based
on edge wear patterns) that Gower artifacts may be hafted knives or scrapers
has been disputed (Patterson, 1979; Shafer, 1979).
Despite their notable resemblances to Archaic projectile points, Gower like
points with basal and stem edge smoothing in the Paleoindian style were
reported from at least five localities: Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964:55,Fig.
17J), Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972), Granite Beach (Crawford,
1965), Merrill (Campbell, 1948; Sorrow et al., 1967:25), and McCann
(Preston, 1969). Lateral stem edge smoothing may not, however, be evidence of any relationship to Paleoindian traits. Pedernales projectile points
recovered from very early levels often show lateral stem edge smoothing.
Those from McCann (Preston, 1969) were found in the same level with the
smooth stem edge Gower like points.
Of the 22 sites and watersheds (Table 3) that have yielded Gower or Gower
like points, only one is not an open site, i.e., the Devil’s Rockshelter (Prewitt,
1966). Twelve are buried sites: Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964); Devil’s Rockshelter (Prewitt, 1966); Willeke (Fox and Hester, 1976); St. Mary’s Hall
(Hester, 1978a, 1979a); Granberg II (Hester and Kohnitz, 1975); Greenhaw
(Weir, 1979); Jetta Court (Wesolowsky et al., 1976); Crumley (Kelly, 1961);
Merrill (Campbell, 1948); McCann (Preston, 1969); Landslide (Sorrow et
al., 1967); and Youngsport (Shafer, 1963). While the Jetta Court specimens
(Wesolowsky et al., 1976:Fig. 11 e-f) were identified as Gower, Hester
(1979b:6) recently expressed doubt about that classification.
At the Greenhaw site (Weir, 1979), a Gower like point (termed Gower II)
was found in the lowest stratum of Midden F (largest midden on the site).
Weir’s (1979) Gower Variety I (found in Midden C) was comparable to Baker
projectile points from Baker Cave (Word and Douglas, 1970:21).
The three Crumley projectile points recovered from near the boundary
between Strata 1 and 2 at the Crumley site (Kelly, 1961) were noted by
Shafer (1963:81) to be similar to Gower points from Youngsport. Crumley
points, among the earliest projectile points recoverd at the site, have shallowly notched bases, poorly developed shoulders, and serrated blade edges
(Kelly, 1961:247-249).
Eleven of the Gower sites are represented by surface collections: Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972); four sites at Camp Bullis (Gerstle et al.,
1978)~ Cibolo Creek (Kelly and Hester, 1976)~ 41BC65 (Weir, 1980);

Tombstone Bluff (Prewitt, 1974); Lake Thunderbird (Duke, 1977); Granite
Beach (Crawford, 1965); and Acton (Blaine et al., 1968). Comparisons with
artifact assemblages at stratified sites and observations of relative patination of
earlier artifacts within assemblages from surface sites provide a degree of
temporal placement.
At Strohacker (Sollberger and Hester, 1972), for example, Paleoindian
and pre-Archaic artifacts except one (an exotic Plainview point) were patinated. At the Camp Bullis sites (Gerstle et al., 1978:81-83), Gower points, at
least one Guadalupe tool, six of seven Martindale points, and most other preArchaic points characteristically were patinated, as were Paleoindian points.
The later Archaic points were not patinated. The seven Gower points recovered from the Lake Thunderbird site (Duke, 1977:Fig. 3k-p) were patinated
heavily as was the "Unknown type" point (Duke, 1977:Fig. 3a). This latter
point appears much like the "Other Paleoindian Points" of Johnson
(1964:Fig. 17L) from Devil’s Mouth.
In addition to Gower artifacts reported from localities in Table 3, Watt
(1938:Fig. 26, Nos. 16-18) illustrated three dart points with deeply indented
bases, roughly rectangular stems, weak to moderately strong shoulders, and
triangular blades. These points were reputed to be among typical projectile
points commonly found in Waco sinker camps in Northcentral Texas along
the Brazos River and its middle drainage. Watt (1938:Fig. 26, No. 24) also
illustrated a corner notched point with a Martindale like stem.

Bell projectile points also have gained status as an indicator of the Early
Archaic. Their geographical range of occurrence appears to be very much
wider than Gower. Bell was defined as a type at the Landslide site (Sorrow et
al., 1967:12, 14, Fig. 10a-j). It has a resemblance to one of the Early Barbed
projectile points found at Devil’s Mouth (Johnson, 1964:Fig. 11o). Bell or
Bell like points were recovered from 15 localities (Table 4). Nine of these also
have yielded Gower or Gower like points.
The identification of a Bell like point at La Perdida (Weir, 1956) could be
challenged, since reports of Bell points from that part of Texas are lacking. At
La Perdida, Weir (1956:PI. 9o) recovered a Shumla projectile point in surface association with both Paleoindian and Archaic points. The slightly expanding stem and convex base conform to the Bell type (Sorrow et al.,
1967). It also has the hint of an indentation in the convex base similar to some
of the points illustrated in Sorrow et al. (1967:Fig. 10b). Whether this is a Bell
point is difficult to confirm without knowing the thickness of the La Perdida
specimen.
Parker and Mitchell (1979:Fig. 1) illustrate five Bell like points recovered
from a sand hill site (41CB64) in Crosby County on the eastern edge of the
Llano Estacado, far from the area of most other Bell occurrences. They point
out apparent similiarities of the Bell type to Calf Creek projectile points in
eastern Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and southern Missouri (Story,
1980:16-17). They also compare one of the Crosby County Bell points to
some of the provisional Charcos points reported from Coahuila, Mexico, by
Heartfield (1975:136, Fig. 2o). Parker and Mitchell (1979) suggest Bell
points are not restricted to Central and Southwest Texas and may be part of
an Early Archaic dart point series with much wider distribution.
The Bell like projectile point recovered at Devil’s Mouth was one of a group
from the deepest Archaic level that Johnson (1964:33-34, Fig. 11j-s) termed
"Early Barbed." The group had in common long barbs formed by basal
notches and wide, thin triangular blades. The great variability among the
group prevented Johnson (1964) from considering it a point type and most
subsequent investigators have followed suit. The early barbed, expanding
stem, early corner notched, early side notched, and early triangular (some of
which may be Bell preforms) categories badly need to be sorted out and a
standardized nomenclature adopted.
The Early Archaic sites under consideration contain a wide variety of tools.
However, in many cases, the tool assemblages recovered from very Early
Archaic levels are not noticeably distinct from those of Archaic occupations
higher in the site (Wesolowsky et al, 1976:39). At other sites, there is little
apparent distinction between late Paleoindian and Archaic tool assemblages
(Blaine et al., 1968; Alexander, 1963). Numerical analysis (Weir, 1976a;
Gunn and Weir, 1976) suggests a difference in tool assemblages from the San
Geronimo to the succeeding Clear Fork Phase; but the distinction diminishes
later in the Central Texas Archaic.
The tool kit predominating in the San Geronimo Phase (comprising irregufar bifaces, six unifacial forms, two core forms, burin truncations, and burin
spalls) shares most of its tool types with tool kits predominating later in the
Archaic. It is relatively unspecialized, seemingly intended for grooving, cut-

ting, and shaping. The Guadalupe tool is the only distinctive tool of the period. This tool in conjunction with Gower or Bell projectile points serves as an
indicator of the San Geronimo/pre-Archaic in Central Texas (Hester and
Kohnitz, 1975:22).
Guadalupe tools were recovered from 13 of the Early Archaic localities
(Table 5). Four sites also yielded Gower or Gower like projectile points and
four sites yielded Bell points.
Panther Springs Creek (41BX228; Jaquier et al., 1979; Black, 1980)
yielded a number of Guadalupe tools both in situ and from backhoe trenching. One Guadalupe tool was recovered in association with a concentration of
burned limestone that may have been a hearth (Jaquier et al., 1979). The
San Geronimo/pre-Archaic assemblage included Guadalupe tools found in
situ in a "Transitional Zone" that also yielded bifacial Clear Fork tools and very
Early Archaic points.
Other Guadalupe tools were recovered from backhoe trenching as well as
bifacial and unifacial Clear Fork tools, Early Archaic points, and triangular
bifaces (Black, personal communication). Bell and possible Angostura points
were reported from the site (Black, 1980:6). A radiocarbon date (Black,
personal communication) of 5330 + 170 B.P. (TX 3912; Masca calibration)
was obtained from material recovered in Level 9 of Area I, an area in which
San Geronimo/pre-Archaic artifacts were concentrated. Most of the Early
Archaic artifacts recovered in that area, however, concentrated on higher
levels (Black, 1980:9).
Guadalupe tools were found at sites along San Miguel Creek in Frio and
McMullen counties (Hester, 1968:Table 1), although not on sites from which
Bell points were recovered.

Department of Highways and Public Transportation. A Guadalupe tool was
recovered from the surface at 41BX196, San Geronimo.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Efforts of Sollberger and Hester (1972) to focus attention on a period of
Southwest and Central Texas prehistory preceding the Early Archaic (Johnson et al., 1962) and following the Paleoindian period resulted in redefinition
of the Early Archaic. Manifestations previously thought of as Early Archaic
now are seen as more closely aligned to the Middle Archaic. Definitions of the
temporal and spatial limits of the redesignated Early Archaic still are tentative,
although early and late periods are being accepted.
Several Early Archaic projectile point types were defined (Gower, Bell,
Martindale, Uvalde) and accepted as temporal diagnostics (Story, 1980).
However, a projectile point type comparable in significance to the ubiquitous
Pedernales point of the Middle Archaic is lacking (Black, personal communication). Most projectile points from Early Archaic contexts fall into an illdefined assortment of forms sharing some gross morphological features such as
triangular blades and side or corner notches. Forms vary from site to site and
even within a site.
Gower and Bell points, among the better Early Archaic diagnostic artifacts,
are found in both Central and Southwest Texas. The Bell type in particular
appears to represent an Early Archaic phenomenon not confined to Central
and Southwest Texas. Projectile point types in the Lower Pecos, where they
are comparable, appear to anticipate similar types in Central Texas.
Subsistence data for the Early Archaic in Central Texas largely is lacking.
There is nothing upon which to form an hypothesis as clear as Weir’s (1976a;
Gunn and Weir, 1976) postulated Middle Archaic dependence on deer and

114

the acorn crop. Only in Southwest Texas, where conditions were ideal for
preservation of nonlithic cultural remains, is the subsistence base during Early
Archaic times fairly clear. Very little evidence (Shafer and Bryant, 1977) has
been found for change of exploitive strategies over time since about 8000
B.P.
Study of the Central Texas environment (Gunn and Mahula, 1977) indicates the post Pleistocene climate in that area was highly variable, even during
the Altithermal. Analysis of lithic technology in Central Texas (Gunn and
Weir, 1976) indicates readaptation to frequent environmental change was
characteristic of the Archaic.
Benedict’s (1979) hypothesis that High Plains and Great Basin populations
moved to refugia in the Central Rockies and Pacific Northwest during the two
severe droughts of the Altithermal provides a model by which to interpret the
apparent concentration of Early Archaic sites along the Balcones Escarpment. Increasing aridity could have induced aboriginal Central Texas populations to concentrate in the Hill Country as Central Texas environmental conditions approached those normal to the Lower Pecos region.
Adaptations to those conditions may have been borrowed from populations whose culture had long since adjusted to arid conditions and the biota of
the Chihuahuan province, forming a "sphere of interaction" (Story, 1980).
The wide distribution of some Early Archaic point types and undefined forms
would be a result of this borrowing. The mesic interval peaking around 5500
B.P. would have relaxed environmental pressures enough so that later Early
Archaic populations could move out on the coastal plains again. A second
adaptation to arid conditions would have been required during the second
lobe of the Altithermal toward the end of the Early Archaic.
The two drought model of the Altithermal reinforces the concept of an
Early Archaic of at least two periods based on projectile point sequences.
Until a series of reliable radiocarbon dates is available for the Early Archaic in
Central Texas to provide absolute chronological underpinnings, periodizations of the Early Archaic remains on shaky ground.

ABSTRACT
Environmental and cultural data spanning the period 13,000-9000 B.P. in the Big Bend are
summarized and discussed. A hypothetical construct of human adaptation to a changing environment during the early Holocene is offered. The construct is based upon extant data from Big
Bend, the lower Pecos River, northern and central Coahuila, and northern and western TransPecos Texas. It is postulated that the eastern Big Bend ultimately may prove to contain the
earliest indications of a transition from Paleoindian to Archaic lifeways in Texas and north central
Mexico due to a unique combination of climatic, biotic, and geologic circumstances existing
during the period 11,000- I0,000 B.P. The primary stimulus for such an adaptation was a mixing
of xerophilous woodland communities with Chihuahuan Desert species in an eastern Big Bend
biotic refugium. This mixture resulted in a vegetation assemblage of maximum potential for
human extractive subsistence economies.

INTRODUCTION
In a general sense, the principal topic is the availability and relationship of
Big Bend resources and landforms to prehistoric human populations of the
terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene. In order to understand and fully appreciate human adaptation through time, it is necessary to understand the environmental context in which such adaptations operated. Toward that end,
an attempt is made to provide a hypothetical construct of cultural environmental interaction for early inhabitants of the Big Bend and adjoining regions.
The construct offered may serve to stimulate renewed interest in this archeologically poorly known region.
Big Bend generally refers to that portion of Trans-Pecos Texas which is
surrounded on three sides by a long, southward sweep of the Rio Grande
River. The Big Bend region is considered to include the southern half of
Brewster and Presidio counties in Texas and northern portions of the states of
Chihuahua and Coahuila in Mexico. A large portion of this area is contained
within Big Bend National Park, which lies at the southern tip of Trans-Pecos
Texas (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Location of the Big Bend region in the Chihuahuan Desert (adapted from
Schmidly, 1977).

Big Bend is situated in the east central portion of the Chihuahuan Desert,
one of the highest North American deserts in terms of both maximum and
mean elevation above sea level (Wells, 1977). Physiographically, Big Bend
lies within the southern portion of the Basin and Range Province (Wauer,
1973a). It consists of a terrain that contains high desert mountains surrounded by extensive gravel surfaces, dissected bajadas, volcanic outcrops,
massive limestone canyons, alluvial valleys, and high fiat topped mesas.
Elevations range from less than 2,000 ft (ca 600 m) above sea level in the
vicinity of Maravillas Canyon on the east to as high as 7,835 ft (2,374 m) at
the summit of Emory Peak in the Chisos Mountains.

Mallouf -- Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

123

Biologically, the region is quite diverse, containing some of the best preserved habitats to be found anywhere in the expansive Chihuahuan Desert.
Luxuriant flora, dominated by broadleaf trees and shrubs, are found along
the floodplains of the few perennial streams of the region, primarily between
elevations of 1,800 ft (545 m) to 4,000 ft (1,212 m) above sea level. Between elevations of about 1,800 ft (545 m) and 3,500 ft (1,060 m), a desert
shrub environment dominates the landscape. This zone contains a variety of
more widely spaced, relatively low growing desert species and includes many
succulents and semisucculents. A generally low growing sotol-grassland prevails just above the desert flats where precipitation is somewhat greater at
elevations of 3,200 ft (970 m) to 5,550 ft (1,667 m).
In still higher elevations, from about 3,700 ft (1,121 m) to 7,800 ft
(2,364 m), the dominant vegetation is of woodland broadleaf and coniferous
composition. Moist woodland assemblages, including Arizona cypress, pine,
and oak, are interspersed within this latter vegetational zone at elevations
from 5,000 ft (1,515 m) to 7,200 ft (2,182 m). Descriptions of modern botanical communities of the Big Bend region are provided in McDougall and
Sperry (1957), Warnock (1970), Wauer (1973a), and Johnston (1977). A
modern vegetational transect through the region is provided in Figure 2 (after
Johnston, 1977:341). Modern vegetational patterns are quite complex due
to variability in topographic, edaphic, and climatic influences.
The fauna of the Chihuahuan Desert also is quite diverse, including 119
species of mammals (Schmidly, 1977), 100 species of native fish (Miller,
1977), 170 species of herpetofauna (Morafka, 1977), and 385 species of
avifauna (Wauer, 1973b). Although broad faunal-floral relationships and
patterns are discernible in the Big Bend region, in many cases it is difficult to
correlate fauna with specific vegetational zones due to habitat overlap and
inherent faunal adaptability.
Although the rugged Big Bend country has been characterized as harsh
and uninviting (Tyler, 1975), it contains an abundance of plant and animal
resources sufficient to sustain a variety of cultural systems. Geologic resources
conducive to human utilization also are plentiful across the Big Bend region.
These resources include numerous rockshelters and caves, providing shelter
and safety from the elements; frequent stone free silt and sand deposits in a
wide variety of environments for open air habitation sites; and innumerable
stone resources, offering a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary outcrops and cobbles as source materials for the production of tools,
weapons, and construction materials.
Contrary to the situation in many areas of North America, ecological and
paleoenvironmental studies in the Trans-Pecos have been pursued more rigorously than cultural investigations (Albritton and Bryan, 1939; Wells, 1966;
Meyer, 1977). Major archeological research was conducted in the Big Bend
during the 1920’s through the early 1950’s at a time when field methods
generally precluded collection of samples for special studies related to environmental reconstruction.
One exceptional study explored the relationships and association of archeological materials with geologic deposits west and north of Big Bend National Park (Kelley et al., 1940). However, this investigation did not focus on

the terminal Pleistocene largely due to a regional scarcity of recognizable
Paleoindian occupational remains.
Archeological investigations carried out since 1954, because of their primarily Iocational nature, have done little to clarify early chronological sequences or specific environmental-cultural relationships in the region. They
have, on the other hand, greatly expanded the available data concerning site
densities, site types, and general settlement patterns and should prove of
considerable aid in the development of research designs for future work
(Campbell, 1970; Tunnell and Mallouf, 1975; Baskin, 1976, 1978; Mallouf
and Tunnell, 1977; Marmaduke, 1978).
Due to interregional similarities in material assemblages, archeological research in the Lower Pecos to the east has heavily influenced interpretations of
researchers working in the less intensively studied Big Bend region. Archeologists in the Lower Pecos, working with the Archaic stage, have treated
cultural development as a relatively homogeneous phenomenon. Strati-

graphic and chronological markers arbitrarily divide the continuity into definable periods or working units (Johnson, 1964; Story, 1966.)
Extensive excavations and radiocarbon dating of deposits at Lake Amistad
facilitated formulation of a comparatively sound chronological sequence
based primarily on projectile point styles. This temporal sequence on occasion has been applied in slightly modified form to morphologically similar
implements found in a variety of contexts in the contiguous Big Bend region
(Marmaduke, 1978). However, applications of the Lower Pecos temporal
framework to the Big Bend should be considered tentative in the absence of
empirical validation.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Although still relatively poorly understood, the Late Pleistocene and Holocene environments of the Big Bend region gradually are becoming better
known as a result of several active avenues of research: palynology, vertebrate paleontology, paleobotany, and geomorphology. While data forthcoming from these disciplines do not always concur, certain broad patterns of
significance to environmental reconstruction are nevertheless evident. Figure
3 provides a chronologically structured synthesis of major contributions from
sample localities within or adjacent to the Big Bend region. The table is arranged by major categories of research (pollen, Neotoma sp. middens, plant
macrofossils, fauna, and geology) in an attempt to illustrate interdisciplinary
discrepancies and gaps in the data base.
Pollen data, based primarily on Martin and Mehringer (1965), Meyer
(1973), Bryant (1974), and Bryant and Shafer (1977), suggest a cool, moist
climate in which woodland, parkland, and scrub grasslands thrived across
much of the Big Bend region during the terminal Pleistocene (13,000-11,000
B.P .). A major constituent of this biotic assemblage across both lowlands and
uplands appears to have been pinyon pine, which today is found only in the
higher elevations of regional mountain ranges. This interpretation generally is
supported by wood rat (Neotoma sp.) midden analysis from Maravillas Canyon, Burro Mesa, Dagger Mountain (Wells, 1966) and Guadalupe, Quitman,
and Hueco mountains (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977; Van Devender
and Spaulding, 1979).
The normally excellent state of preservation and relative ease of identification of plant macrofossils in wood rat middens would appear to make them
the more reliable indicator of past environments (Wells, 1976). There are
differences in content between reported middens from the eastern edge of the
Big Bend and those from areas to the north and west. Middens from very low
elevations (660 m or 1,980 ft) in Maravillas Canyon (Wells, 1966) along the
eastern extent of the Big Bend reveal a terminal Pleistocene mixture of
xerophytic woodland species (pinyon pine, juniper, algerita, live oak, and

Mallouf - Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

127

prickly pear) in association with more arid adapted species, such as lechuguilla, acacia, and sotol. These latter elements are characteristic of the present
Chihuahuan Desert region.
Fossil middens in higher elevated areas of the Chihuahuan Desert support
a dominance of pinyon juniper woodland "... from 600-1,495 m [1,9804,934 ft] on limestone from the Guadalupe Mountains in the north to the
Hueco Mountains in the west to the Chinati and Chisos mountains in the
south" (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977:14). The northern and western
samples, however, are distinguished by an absence of lechuguilla and other
typical Chihuahuan Desert species.
This factor would seem to support Well’s (1977) contention that the low
elevations of the eastern Big Bend (Fig. 4) served as a refugium for such
species during the downward displacement and spread of woodlands in the
Pleistocene. In addition, it would indicate that a subsequent gradual spread of
Chihuahuan Desert species during the early Holocene (11,000-9,000 B.P.)
followed a south-and-east to north-and-west progression. Wells (1966) estimates a Pleistocene downward displacement of pinyon-juniper-oak
woodlands to some 800 m below their present lower limit, implying their
presence during 14,800-11,560 B.P. across vast basins and lowlands now
dominated by creosote bush (Larrea sp).
Both Wells (1966, 1977) and Van Devender (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977; Van Devender and Spaulding, 1979) provide reasonable arguments for the widespread existence of xerophytic woodlands in Big Bend
during the terminal Pleistocene. As a whole, the pollen data appear to support such an inference. However, there is at least one potential interpretive
problem area in the region of Cuatro Ci@negas in central Coahuila. The area
is 150 mi (250 km) to the south of the Big Bend region, in roughly the south
central portion of the Chihuahuan Desert (Minckley, 1969; Meyer, 1973,
1975).
This small, intermontane valley has an average elevation of ca 2,442 ft
(740 m) and is surrounded by mountains rising as high as 9,900 ft
(3,000 m). Although the floor of this basin falls well within the elevation range
of Big Bend Late Pleistocene woodland assemblages, pollen evidence from
Cuatro Ci~negas (Fig. 3) would seem to indicate relatively stable, unchanging
desert shrub communities there during the last 30,000 to 40,000 years
(Meyer, 1973). It may be that a heretofore exclusive reliance on pollen data at
Cuatro Ci@negas has resulted in an incomplete picture of biotic assemblages
present there during the terminal Pleistocene.
Assuming that interpretations for the Big Bend region are reasonably accurate, the environment can be reconstructed as it was seen by the first Clovis
groups to arrive sometime between 12,000-11,000 B.P. The higher mountain masses probably contained expanded conifer forest communities of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, spruce, and other more mesophytic species (Van
Devender and Wiseman, 1977). Pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands, which now
generally are confined to elevations above 5,000 ft. (1,500 m), were displaced downward to elevations as low as 1,980 ft (600 m) in the vicinity of
Maravillas Canyon (Wells, 1966).

The broad expanses of creosote bush covered bajadas one sees today
probably were a mosaic of woodland, parkland, and scrub grassland, composed primarily of pinyon pine, juniper, oak, and grasses. Water in springs
and seeps almost certainly was more constant and available than at present
due to increased effective moisture. As a result, water courses probably were
more heavily wooded with a more diverse assortment of vegetation than
encompassing bajadas. Grass cover across the bajadas probably was much

less severe. Pollen data indicate generally wetter conditions, although Wells
(1966) suggests a relatively dry, cool climate for the lowlands (Fig. 3).
The early Holocene (11,000-9,000 B.P.), due to a gradual warming and
drying trend, saw an overall reduction in forest species in the lowlands and a
concomitant increase in woodland (oak and juniper) and grassland biota (Fig.
3). Although precipitation regimes during this period may have been changing (Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977), perennial water sources remained
much more abundant than at present.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
In comparison to environmental data, cultural data for the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene in the Big Bend are scant. The only evidence found
to date of Paleoindian presence in Big Bend proper are a few surface finds of
their distinctive projectile points. Campbell’s (1970) survey of Big Bend National Park took him to several hundred archeological sites. Campbell reports
finding only one Clovis and four Plainview-Golondrina points during the
course of his survey, facts which led him to speculate that Paleoindian occupation in the region was sporadic at best (Campbell, 1970:71). Evidence of
Folsom occupation is lacking. Similar finds in areas immediately adjacent to
the park and in northern Mexico are quite rare and often poorly documented.
To the west and north of Big Bend, Paleoindian materials are found more
consistently and in greater quantity. Evidence of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview occupations are found to the north in the Pecos, Texas area (Hamilton
Collection: notes on file, Texas Historical Commission); and a major Folsom
habitation site was discovered to the northwest of Big Bend near Van Horn,
Texas in the 1950’s (Lindsay, 1969). Krone (1975) reported a series of
Folsom finds from the El Paso area in the western Trans-Pecos.
East of Big Bend in the Lower Pecos region, evidence of Holocene Paleoindian activity was found in the deepest cultural levels of an extensive silt
river terrace (Johnson, 1964). At Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain, 1968),
definitive evidence of early Holocene Folsom and Plainview big-game hunting (ca 10,230 B.P.) was found at a repeatedly used bison jump. A few
surface finds of terminal Pleistocene Clovis points also were made in the
Lower Pecos region (Campbell, 1970:67). Paleoindian habitation sites have
not yet been identified in the Lower Pecos region.
Evidence of terminal Pleistocene Clovis occupation occurs from the Lower
Pecos region west across Big Bend, throughout the southwestern United
States, into northwestern Mexico. Clovis materials recovered to date in
Trans-Pecos Texas are surface finds. Early Holocene Folsom remains, on the
other hand, are reported from east of the Big Bend in the Lower Pecos region
(Bonfire Shelter) and to the north and northwest of Big Bend in the Pecos and
Van Horn, Texas areas. Evidence of Folsom occupation has not yet been
found in the Big Bend proper.
Early Holocene Plainview occupations are known to occur in the lower and
middle Pecos River areas (Bonfire Shelter and Hamilton Collection), but are

134

not well documented from Big Bend and areas west to El Paso. Golondrina
points commonly assigned to Plainview (Johnson, 1964; Campbell, 1970)
occur sporadically in the Big Bend proper (Campbell, 1970).

GENERAL CULTURAL-ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS
There are several factors to weigh in considering Paleoindian environmental relationships in Big Bend and adjacent regions. Evidence is lacking for use
of rockshelters or caves as habitation sites by Clovis, Folsom, or later big game
hunters. The use of Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain, 1968) by Folsom
and Plainview hunters in the Lower Pecos region was directly related to the
short term killing and butchering of large game. If Paleoindian incursions into
the Lower Pecos and Big Bend were as sporadic as findings (Dibble and
Lorrain, 1968; Campbell, 1970) indicate, then short term, open hunting
camps located on strategic, well elevated landforms for observing the surrounding terrain may prove characteristic. Long term encampments, on the
other hand, may indeed be rare and could occur in a variety of environmental
settings.
Additional considerations might have influenced cultural-environmental
interactions, specifically during the early Holocene in Big Bend. Jennings
(1957) early proposed that Paleoindian cultures in the semiarid to arid lands
of the western United States evolved a cultural tradition, termed the Desert
Culture, which was distinctly different from that of the Central Plains and the
densely wooded eastern United States. He proposed that the Desert Culture
was a more economically generalized, but basic, adaptation to greater aridity
and a concomitant lack or scarcity of large game or herd animals. It involved
intensive exploitation of plant resources as well as a variety of available fauna.
Within many regions of the southwestern United States, the Desert Archaic
is best represented in rockshelter and cave sites, where datable remains may
range as early as 11,000 B.P. (Jennings, 1957; Aikens, 1970), such dates
being comparable to Paleoindian dates on the High Plains. The Desert Archaic could be considered an alternative early Holocene adaptation as opposed to the Plains bison-hunting lifeway typified by Folsom and Plainview
remains.
With regard to areas south of Big Bend in Coahuila, Taylor (1966:61-62)
observed that:
From the earliest times of which we have knowledge to the latest there was a
cultural continuum in Coahuila, belonging to what has been called the Desert
culture . . . Many classes and types of artifacts are the same from bottom to top in
the stratigraphic sequence. Variations occur and relative frequencies change, but
without doubt it is a single cultural ~adition throughout its approximately 10,000
years.
Taylor’s (1966) Chihuahuan Desert data, the earliest dates for which are
9,540 B.P. and 9,300 B.P., were obtained from the lowest levels of cave sites
in central Coahuila. Evidence of earlier Clovis or Folsom occupation is absent.
In the central and eastern United States, there appears to be a continuum of
development from big game hunters to more diversified hunting-gathering

Mallouf - Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

(Archaic) adaptations during the period 9,000 B.P. - 7,000 B.P. However,
because of a rather unique combination of climatic, biotic, and geologic circumstances in the Big Bend region during the early Holocene, similar adaptations may have been spurred at an earlier time. It is proposed that a highly
favorable ecological corridor afforded by mixed woodland and desert shrub
biotic assemblages in the eastern limb of the Big Bend region may have served
as a partial catalyst for a very early cultural transition from a nomadic big game
hunting subsistence base to more localized hunting-gathering (Archaic) adaptations. In the eastern Big Bend, such an adaptation may have occurred as
early as 10,500-10,000 B.P., a period roughly corresponding to the florescence of Folsom culture across the Plains.

EARLY HOLOCENE ADAPTATION IN THE EASTERN BIG BEND
Well’s (1966) Neotoma data from Maravillas Canyon indicate a mixture of
xerophilous woodland (primarily pinyon pine [Pinus cembroides remota],
juniper [Juniperus pinchotii], algerita [Berberis trifoliolata], shrubby live oak
[Quercus pungens and Q. grisea], and prickly pear [Opuntia macrocentra])
and desert shrubs and succulents (such as lechuguiUa [Agave lechuguilla],
acacia [Acacia roemeriana], and sotol [Dasylirion leiophyllum]) across the
lower elevations of the eastern Big Bend prior to 12,500 B.P. Sometime
between 12,500 and 12,000 B.P., the onset of somewhat drier conditions
resulted in a slight reduction of pinyon pine, an increase in scrub oak and
juniper, and a notable increase in desert species (Fig. 3).
It is likely that the greatest admixture of desert shrub with xerophytic
woodland was present in the lower elevations of eastern Big Bend National
Park and adjoining Black Gap Wildlife Refuge (Fig. 4). Wells (1977) notes
that the most extensive areas of the Chihuahuan Desert lie above 4,000 ft.
(1,219 m) and that:
The outstanding exception is the anomalous valley followed by the throughflowing Rio Grande on it circuitous course from the snows of the Colorado Rockies
to the Gulf of Mexico. In the Big Bend area of western Texas and adjacent
Coahuila, elevation along the river drops to less than 610 m (2,000 ft) above sea
level, the lowest elevation [and the most arid sector] in the entire Chihuahuan
Desert province, which extends from southeastern Arizona and southeastern New
Mexico to Zacatecas and southern San Luis Potosi.

Wells (1977) discussed the probability of the eastern limb of the Big Bend
serving as a refugium for desert vegetation during the full glacial pluvial. He
concluded that a continued pluvial downward migration of the desert zone
farther east along the lower course of the Rio Grande as far as the Lower
Pecos region would have been unlikely due to an increased precipitation
regime originating in warm, moist air masses over the Gulf of Mexico.
Based upon knowledge of the constituents of modern woodland and desert plant communities in this region, such a biotic mixture would have afforded enormous potential for food gathering. This favorable setting would
have been enhanced by good availability of water supply in the eastern Big
Bend along the river and its tributaries. Additional favorable attributes included inhabitable rockshelters and caves in the massive bedded limestone of

135

136

the eastern area and elevated, silt terraces along the river and its major tributaries.
The eastern Big Bend region, then, must have presented an optimal habitat
for food gathering during the period 11,000-10,000 B.P., a time corresponding to the florescence of Folsom culture across much of North America. The
development of a comparable mixed woodland-desert shrub assemblage in
the high elevations of the northern and western Big Bend and adjoining regions occurs some 2,000 years later (Van Devender and Spaulding, 1979;
Van Devender and Wiseman, 1977). Because of the unusually rich and varied assortment of plant resources available in the eastern Big Bend, it is conceivable that subsistence emphases might have experienced a somewhat pronounced shift from hunting to gathering quite early.
Coincident to this development would have been adjustments in the distribution of groups across the landscape, group sizes, and home range sizes.
These adjustments eventually would culminate in the distinctive Archaic lifestyle that characterized the following 9,000 years in this and adjoining regions.
The next problem that must be confronted is where in the eastern Big Bend
such early, culturally transitional archeological components can be expected
to be found and how they can be recognized. There are extant preliminary
data that help in generally discussing the first question. The second question,
however, is more difficult to resolve.

CURRENT RESEARCH
Since 1973, the Office of the State Archeologist has conducted a staggered
series of nonextractive archeological reconnaissances along the Rio Grande.
The study area stretches from Redford (Presidio County) downstream
through numerous canyon systems to Dryden Crossing (Terrell County), a
distance of some 275 river miles (440 km). Because of the remote and fiequently inaccessible nature of the terrain, all work was conducted in river
segments by way of canoe expeditions. Each expedition was normally of a 7
to 14 day duration (Tunnell and Mallouf, 1975~ MaUouf and Tunnell, 1977).
As a result of this work, over 150 archeological sites were recorded along both
sides of the river and in the mouths of its major tributaries in the eastern Big
Bend area (Sanderson Canyon, Panther Canyon, San Francisco Canyon,
Ca~on Caballo Blanco, Ca~on de San Rosendo, Reagan Canyon, Big Canyon, Maravillas Canyon, Ca~on de Ceferino).
Site types consist primarily of rockshelters and caves in limestone bluffs and
open campsites on elevated silt terraces. Intrasite surficial features commonly
consist of burned rock accumulations, hearths, occasional burned rock middens, burned rock talus, bedrock mortars and metates, and occasional petroglyph panels inside or in front of rockshelters and caves. Surficial cultural
debris commonly encountered at open campsites consist primarily of groundstone implements, various tools such as retouched flakes and projectile
points, and quantities of debitage in midden sediments. Within the shelters
and caves, surface remains include perishable items (cut sticks, lechuguilla

137.

and sotol quids, cordage), groundstone implements, debitage, and occasional projectile points. Temporally diagnostic artifacts observed on the surface of sites thus far are indicative of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric affiliations.
Although many open and sheltered sites appear to have the potential for
deeply buried early components, it is possible that geomorphological and
hydrological processes in the past have greatly altered or eliminated such
deposits. These factors may have directly affected the presence or absence of
such components, particularly in open silt terrace sites. Much of the river
course in the eastern Big Bend is contained within steep walled limestone
canyons which serve to narrow average river width considerably. During
floods, river waters are funneled through the narrow canyons at an accelerated rate, cutting away existing silt and gravel terraces and creating new terraces. The force of such floods is attested by the presence of jumbled up,
water worn boulders the size of automobiles in the floors of some tributary
canyons.
Most very early components contained in silt terraces fronting the river
probably have long since been removed by erosion. Exceptions to this generalization include: silt terraces at elevations high enough to avoid most flooding; and terraces that are relatively high and protected from swift river currents by fortuitously located bedrock outcrops or other natural phenomena.
This interpretation is supported by the fact that, out of 40 silt terrace sites
examined in this area, only five exhibit the definite presence of deeply buried
cultural zones. This observation is based upon examination of erosional cut
banks within numerous site areas. In main stem river reaches having broader
and more open floodplains, the percentage of deeply buried components
should increase markedly (Fig. 5). A similar situation can be expected under
favorable conditions in the lower reaches of tributary canyons.
In light of the hydrologic situation, archeologists must depend primarily on
the deep, well preserved cultural deposits in numerous extensive rockshelters
and caves for the earliest indications of hunting-gathering adaptations. Numerous, extensive dry caves, containing what appear to be very deep cultural
deposits with perishable remains, are within the Lower Canyons on both
Texas and Coahuila sides of the river (Mallouf and Tunnell, 1977). These
same sites probably contain Neotoma middens and paleontological assemblages. Rockshelters and caves containing good cultural deposits always
are well elevated above the river. Those located in bluffs too low to the river
are invariably scoured clean by rushing flood waters.
Rockshelters and caves having good potential are to be found throughout
the extensive limestone areas of the eastern Big Bend (Fig. 6). They are,
however, particularly susceptible to destruction by relic hunters, primarily
because of the ease with which they can be located and the richness of their
artifactual remains. It is essential that controlled, scientific investigations be
carried out at select sites in the near future.
In cases where such natural features were available, there appears to have
been a propensity toward rockshelters and caves as habitation sites in the
Archaic of Big Bend. While rockshelters are not difficult to locate, recognition

138

of transitional Paleoindian to Early Archaic components in their deposits may
pose somewhat more of a problem.
In the Lower Pecos region, the earliest components within rockshelters
have yielded radiocarbon dates of ca 9,110 to 8,500 B.P. and are characterized by lithic assemblages containing nonfluted Golondrina, Lerma, and
Early Barbed projectile points (Ross, 1965; Epstein, 1960; Word and
Douglas, 1970). To the south in central Coahuila, the earliest dated cave
occupations range around 9,500 B.P. and also are characterized by Lermalike, nonfluted points. A variety of typical Desert Archaic perishable items
include rattlesnake rattles, agave fiber sandals, twill pad sandals, and a variety
of other woven objects (Taylor, 1966).
Although similarities with these extraregional early assemblages are expected to be found in transitional assemblages in the eastern Big Bend area,
sites of the latter area additionally should reflect differences that will be attributable to an earlier shift in the balance of human subsistence from animal to
plant foods. This subsistence shift in the eastern Big Bend is expected to
predate similar adaptations in the two adjoining regions by at least 1,000
years, or as early as about 10,500 B.P. This postulation, if valid, will have
implications with respect to the development of similar adaptations in adjoining regions.

Mallouf -- Big Bend Pleistocene/Holocene Observations

DATA SUMMARY
1. Due to downward displacement of xerophytic woodlands, a desert
shrub refugium of Chihuahuan Desert species existed in the lower elevations
of the eastern Big Bend at ca 14,000 to 10,000 B.P.
2. Within this terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene refugium, desert shrub
species were mixed with xerophilous woodland species. This mixture resulted
in a vegetation assemblage of maximum potential for human extractive subsistence economies.
3. The favorability of the eastern Big Bend refugium for human occupation was enhanced by the presence of extensive, stone free terrace surfaces,
innumerable rockshelters and caves for habitation, and relatively stable water
sources.

4. Although sparse and surficial in nature, there is evidence for utilization
of the Big Bend region and the north central Coahuila region by terminal
Pleistocene big game hunters of Clovis affiliation. Early Holocene Folsom
remains have not been discovered in the Big Bend to date, regardless of
numerous, regional archeological surveys. Evidence in the Big Bend of utilization of rockshelters and caves by Paleoindian fluted point traditions is lacking.
5. By 10,500 B.P. in the eastern Big Bend, the xerophilous woodland was
in gradual retreat due to drying conditions which favored the spread of Chihuahuan Desert species. Assuming the presence of man in this ecologically
highly favorable environment, it is likely that a cultural transition to a gathering subsistence economy already was underway by this date. This adaptation
probably placed more emphasis on rockshelters as longer term habitation
sites in response to a constricting of territorial range. Specimens exhibiting
similarities to Angostura, Golondrina, and Lerma projectile points, along with
a variety of groundstone implements, will be found to characterize this very
early adaptation. An absence of Folsom remains in the eastern Big Bend may
be attributable to an attendant pre 10,500 B.P. shift in lithic technology and
tool assemblages.
6. In contrast, to the east in the Lower Pecos region, the Paleoindian big
game tradition existed until 10,000 B.P. and possibly longer due to a continued presence of parkland grasses. This grasslands may have supported bison
herds as late as 8,500 B.P. (based on pollen data). The prolonged existence
of parklands is attributed to greater influence on this area of eastern (Gulf of
Mexico) climatic regimes.
7. In the Lower Pecos region, pollen evidence exists by 9,500 B.P. for
xerophilous parkland vegetation with mixtures of desert shrub succulents.
The earliest radiocarbon dates from inhabited rockshelters and open sites in
the Lower Pecos fall within a range from 9,500 to 8,900 B.P. (Word and
Douglas, 1970; Epstein, 1960; Johnson, 1964) and are associated with nonspecialized, Archaic like assemblages. The environment at 9,500 B.P.
roughly corresponds to that of the eastern Big Bend 1,000 years earlier. This
latent correspondence suggests the concomitant spread of biotic regimes and
attendant cultural adaptive traits from west to east.

142

8. The earliest dated assemblages from northern and central Coahuila
range between 9,500 and 9,300 B.P. (Taylor, 1966) and are of a distinctive
Archaic character. These assemblages suggest the possibility of migration of
peoples and/or adaptive traits from already established Archaic traditions in
the Big Bend to the north. Unlike the more northerly regions, the transitional
Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene environmental of central Coahuila may
have remained more stable (from pollen data).
9. Neotorna sp. midden data for the higher elevated northern and western
sections of the Big Bend and adjacent areas indicate the development of
mixed xerophilous desert shrub biotic assemblages no earlier than 8,500 B.P.
or 2,000 years later than in the eastern Big Bend. Although radiocarbon dates
for cultural assemblages in these areas are lacking, it is predicted that the
earliest evidences of Archaic lifeways will roughly correspond to this late date;
such influences will have emanated, along with biotic characteristics, from
sources to the south and east in the Big Bend proper.
As one moves westward, the dates of origin of such assemblages will, for an
undetermined distance, correspondingly decrease. Because of a longer duration of parkland grassland (and attendant bison herds) in these northerly and
westerly regions, the presence of Paleoindian big game hunting traditions in
the form of both kill sites and habitation sites can be expected to occur there as
late as 9,000 to 8,500 B.P.

ABSTRACT
Archeological investigations were carried out in 1975 by the Aggie Anthropological Society at
the Attaway Site (41HEl14), a late Caddoan (Frankston Focus) locality discovered eroding into
Lake Palestine in Henderson County, Texas. Lakeshore erosion processes destroyed or displaced most archeological materials but exposed a midden area and numerous pottery vessels
thought to mark a small cemetery. Test excavations were conducted to confirm the existence of
the cemetery, test for undisturbed deposits, and retrieve an artifact sample from the midden area.
Analysis of the lithic collections yielded new information on the procurement and reduction
techniques associated with the late Caddoan lithic technology. Sherd and vessel analyses also
revealed that the vessel assemblages from the midden and cemetery were qualitatively different;
the midden contained predominantly jar sherds embellished by wet paste decorations while
vessels associated with the mortuary area consisted mostly of bowls decorated with engraved
designs. Attaway is interpreted as being a late Caddoan farming hamlet occupied long enough
for an estimated five to seven individuals to be interred in the associated cemetery.

ATTAWAY SITE (41HEl14)
The Attaway site was recorded by Southern Methodist University (SMU) as
X41HE13 during the course of their salvage work in the Lake Palestine basin
(Anderson, 1971:Table 1). The locality was described as being a "sherd scatter" located on low knolls on a terrace projection 20 ft above the floodplain of
the Neches River at an elevation of 360 ft above mean sea level. The area of
occupation is at the east end of a long peninsula of land surrounded by a wide
floodplain created by the confluence of Flat Creek and the Neches River (Fig.
1). The floodplain and eastern end of the peninsula now are submerged by
the waters of Lake Palestine; the exposed land feature is known as Henderson Point (Fig. 2). The site covers an area of about 100 by 75 m and lies in an
upland microenvironment (Anderson, 1971).

Anderson (1971:37)

described "sherd scatters" as
"sites at which only sherds were found; the number varies from 1-32, and sites vary
considerably in extent; most cover less than 50 square meters. Some of these may
represent outposts at farmed fields. In the absence of hunting tools, tool manufacture,
and ground stone tools they are presumed not to have been hunting and gathering
camps or base settlements".

The prehistoric cultural materials once were buried in a sand mantle overlying a sterile orange mottled clay along the east slope of the knoll. Sand depth
varies on the knoll from a few centimeters near the crest to nearly a meter

along the eastern edge. At the time of the TAMU investigations, the eastern
front of the knoll was inundated from the original bluff slope to about midway
to the knoll crest. Evidently, most prehistoric cultural material was on the
eastern most portion of the knoll, that portion most affected by the lake.
In 1975, the shoreline occurred east of Bluewater Road about 75 m from
the knoll crest where a lake cabin recently had been constructed (Figs. 2, 4).
Inundation of the eastern portion of the knoll and erosional effects of this
inundation process virtually destroyed the in situ deposits at the site. A series
of diagrams illustrating the destructive processes are shown in Figure 3.

The presumed conditions before inundation are shown in Figure 3-1. As
the waters of the rising lake level began to creep upslope along the basal clay
and saturate the overlying sands that contained cultural material, water
movement through the sand created a quicksand effect as far inland as the
waters extended on the clay (Fig. 3-2). The quicksand condition was observed by the author south of the site. Once the sand became water saturated,
it was quickly undermined and eroded into the lake (Fig. 3-3). Cultural material then was subjected to shoreline and wave turbulence; cultural features

and their contents, such as pottery vessels, either were broken or completely
displaced.

site), at least some of the pottery vessels had been displaced from their original location by wave action. It was suspected that the vessels were part of a
mortuary assemblage associated with a late Caddoan cemetery, but shoreline
erosion had scoured the graves, leaving little intact material. At the very least,
it was hoped that grave pit outlines could be located in order to confirm the

152

cemetery assumption; at the very most, it was hoped that the number of
graves could be determined and other site features located.

ENVIRONMENT
A detailed description of the environment of the Lake Palestine area is in
Anderson (1971:5-13) and Anderson et al. (1974:4-7). Certain general aspects of the environment relevant to the present study are reviewed.
Lake Palestine is near the western border of a zone of mixed pine-oak forest, with
predominantly sandy soils, in a region of 40-46 inches of rainfall per year. Summers are warm and long, with approximately 260 frost-free days between March
and November (Anderson et al., 1974:4).
Anderson et al. (1974:6) lists four major soil types within the lake area: 1)
alluvial sandy Ioams of the bottoms; 2) fine brown sandy Ioams and loamy
sands of the uplands; 3) red fine sandy Ioams of moderate to low fertility
which occur in the eastern uplands~ and 4) infertile loamy soils on upland
slopes. The soil type associated with 41HEl14 is included in category 2.
Lithic resources which were available locally include ferrugenous sandstone from the Neches Formation and fine grained quartzite, petrified wood,
and some small chert pebbles. The materials occur in Pleistocene gravels,
especially along the western border of the river bottoms (Anderson et al.,
1974:7).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Archeological History
Archeological work began in the upper Neches Valley in the 1930’s under
the sponsorship of the University of Texas and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Numerous archeological sites were investigated during this
decade and quality of work varied considerably. The basic objective of these
endeavors was the acquisition of large collections of artifacts, especially pottery vessels. This early work resulted, however, in an awareness of regional
differences in ceramic variation and mortuary practices (Jackson, 1936,
1938).
Ceramic collections were used by Krieger (Suhm et al., 1954:151-227) to
define several prehistoric cultural units (termed foci) following the Midwestern
Taxonomic System. The Alto, Frankston, and Allen foci incorporated the
upper and middle Neches River areas. The Alto Focus was defined largely on
the basis of the massive WPA excavations at the George C. Davis site in
Cherokee County (Newell and Krieger, 1949~ Story, 1972~ Shafer, 1973).
The Frankston and Allen foci were defined on the basis of excavation samples
from the A. C. Saunders, Omer and Otis Hood, Isabel Donnell, W. W. Ellis,
J. M. Cook, Jim Allen, and Patton sites among others (Suhm et al.,
1954:184-189).

Shafer - Attaway Site

The first archeological survey of the upper Neches area was conducted in
1957 under the auspices of the National Park Service River Basin Surveys
(Johnson, 1961) in the Blackburn Crossing (now Lake Palestine) basin.
Johnson (1961) reported 35 archeological sites, all but one of which yielded
ceramics. Preliminary ceramic classification revealed that most sites belonged
to the Frankston Focus although one was defined as an Alto Focus site.
Archaic sites were represented by a single example.
A more intensive archeological survey was conducted in the Lake Palestine
basin by SMU in 1969 and 1970 (Anderson, 1971). A total of 98 sites were
located within the reservoir area including 85 ceramic sites. Only eight of
Johnson’s (1961) sites were rerecorded. A small number of middle Archaic
sites were noted and interpreted as "intermittently used hunting sites" (Anderson, 1971:iii).
The SMU survey was structured in a problem oriented manner with the
primary aim the establishment of a settlement model for the Caddoan occupations that could be tested by an excavation program. Survey conditions
generally were poor and the field parties had difficulty in confirming the Iocation of Johnson’s (1961) sites due to heavy vegetation and time of year.
Despite these shortcomings, sites were arbitrarily grouped into seven descriptive/functional classes: chipping scatter, hunting station, gathering station,
gathering camp, sherd scatter, base camp/settlement, and base settlement.
Sites were placed into one of these categories based on field observations
regardless of the survey conditions, topographic setting and visibility, and
surface exposure of the site at the time of the survey. Ethnographic sources on
the Hasinai Caddo were reviewed to obtain an indication of site variability and
a "settlement model" was formulated with the archeological and ethnographical data.
Using information derived from the 1969-70 survey, SMU selected 10 sites
for partial excavation to test the settlement model. More specifically, the
stated objectives for the Caddo sites were:
¯ . . to determine the settlement-types represented by excavated sites. The proce-

dure is to discriminate between alternative elements of a settlement model proposed from survey data and the ethnographic accounts of the Hasinai. The alternatives, which have been proposed on the basis of surveys, are base
settlements, temporary camps and hunting stations. Their ethnographic equivalents are swidden hamlets, fishing camps and hunting camps or stations (Anderson et al., 1974:2).
The predicted Archaic settlement model was described as follows:
It was initially proposed that the Archaic occupation of the Upper Neches River
consisted of transient hunting camp sites where bifacial tools were made, with
other economic and technological activities expected at a base camp or gathering
camp being minimal. It was suggested that these camps were part of the seasonal
cycle of hunting bands whose territory extended to central Texas (Anderson et al.,

1974:183).
Data from three excavated sites were used to test the Archaic model. The
findings indicated that the Archaic settlements were more intensively used
than initially was anticipated. This situation implied that the patterns of activities probably were more generalized rather than specialized, regimented behaviors. Excavation results failed to confirm the predicted Caddoan settlement model (Anderson et al., 1974:178-188) as Caddoan sites essentially
were described in the end as being "base settlements".

Prehistory
The prehistory of East Texas is divided into four periods (Story, 1981):
Paleoindian (12,000 - 8000 B.P.), Archaic (8000 to 2150 B.P.), Early
Ceramic (2150 B.P. - 1250 B.P. [A.D. 700]), and Late Prehistoric (1250
B.P. - 250 B.P.; A.D. 700 - A.D. 1700). Not all periods are defined in the
upper Neches drainage, presumably due, in part, to previous research emphasis and poor site visibility.
The earliest assemblage to be consistently represented is the Late Archaic.
Known Late Archaic sites, or sites in which the Late Archaic assemblage are
well represented, include 41HE19, Mitchell (41HE18), Forest Drive
(41HE184), and Beach (41AN62)(Johnson, 1961; Anderson et al., 1974).
These sites characteristically are situated on prominent knolls or ridges and
usually are in proximity to permanent streams and several different environmental zones. The material assemblage is dominated by lithic artifacts. The
non specialized foraging adaptation left few formal or specialized tools.
Dart points signaling the use of the spear and spear thrower are the most
diagnostic artifacts. The reductive process of their manufacture produced a
series of bifacial forms and residual flake debris that dominate most Archaic
assemblages. Uniface tools are not common and there is a general lack of
formal tools other than projectile points. Dart point types which occur include
Gary, Ellis, Kent, and Castroville like. Ferrugenous sandstone and hematite
cobbles exhibiting one or more surface depressions are common at most sites,
including the Archaic locations.
Story’s (1981) Early Ceramic Period has not been defined in the upper
Neches but is known to occur in the middle portion of the drainage (Shafer,
1973:27-33; Arnold, 1973; Creel, 1979:145-148). It is recognized on the
basis of sandy paste pottery which usually occurs with a Late Archaic lithic
assemblage containing Gary and Kent dart points.
The earlier phase of the Late Prehistoric Period is represented meagerly in
the present site inventory for the lake basin. Sites 41SM73 and 41HE81
(Mitchell) yielded ceramics recognized as Alto Focus forms and arrow point
types Alba, Friley, and Steiner (Johnson, 1961; Anderson, 1971; Anderson
et al., 1974), indicating some exploitation of the upper Neches area at this
time. The Alto Focus is the dominant cultural unit is the middle Neches,
centering around the large mound complex settlement at George C. Davis
(Newell and Krieger, 1949).
The dominant cultural assemblage in the upper Neches is the late phase of
the Late Prehistoric Period, notably sites yielding ceramics diagnostic of the
Frankston Focus (Suhm, et al., 1954:184-189). Diagnostic ceramics include
Poynor Engraved, Hume Engraved, LaRue Neck Banded, Maydelle Incised,
Killough Pinched, Bullard Brushed, Fulton Aspect effigy bowls, and elbow
pipes. Possibly intrusive pottery includes Taylor Engraved and Ripley Engraved. These types are associated with the Titus Focus assemblage, a contemporary cultural unit northeast of the research area.
Arrow point forms are almost exclusively Perdiz. Other artifacts common to
this assemblage includes large, expertly thinned, lozenge or lenticular shaped
bifaces and celts that are typically short and thick, exhibiting unsmoothed

Shafer - Attaway Site

155

peck marks over much of the surface except the bit and extreme poll end.
These celts are usually of Ouachita sandstone from eastern Oklahoma or
western Arkansas.
Frankston Focus sites generally appear superficially as sherd and lithic scatters on sandy knolls or ridges in proximity to permanent water and arable
uplands. Attempts to define functional variability between such sites were not
successful (Anderson, 1974:178-188). This lack of success suggests that the
most visible archeological remains are those of small farmsteads or hamlets,
judging from the diversity of ceramic vessels indicated in most sherd samples.
Cemeteries associated with these sites usually are small, containing one or
more graves, although large cemeteries are known (Omer and Otis Hood;
Suhm et al., 1954). Graves generally are oriented east-west with the corpse
extended on its back with its head to the east. The mortuary assemblage
includes ceramic vessels, pipes, arrow points, bifaces, ochre, celts, mussel
shells, and other shell artifacts.
Two mound sites, A. C. Saunders (Jackson, 1936) and Pace McDonald
(Story, 1981), are associated with the Frankston Focus. A. C. Saunders
(Jackson, 1936) consisted of an ash mound, measuring approximately 2 m
thick and some 30 m in diameter, which was largely devoid of artifactual
refuse; a midden area that reached a thickness of almost I m was associated
with a large, circular structure measuring about 14 m in diameter. The midden contained a wide range of refuse including sherds, pipes, lithics, and
faunal remains. Accumulation of the midden and ash deposits evidently required a considerable span of time as Jackson (1938) was able to show a
significant temporal change in pipe forms from the midden. He compared the
site to descriptions of Hasinai temples and interpreted the remains as being
those of a Hasinai fire temple.
Discussion
Both SMU settlement models proved to be too simplistic and idealistic to
explain the variability or lack of it in the archeological record. The models are
both static with regard to time and culture process and thereby lack necessary
evolutionary flexibility. The region witnessed at least two separate prehistoric
adaptive systems. The Archaic emphasized a broad spectrum adaptive pattern that used virtually all available land surface. By contrast, the Caddoan
adaptations, including the Alto and more specifically the Frankston Focus
peoples, were more specialized with their pursuit of agriculture. While their
adaptive pattern also undoubtedly utilized much of the land, supplementing
their farming with gathering and hunting, they were tethered to the fields
much of the year in a manner that necessitated maintaining a permanent
residence nearby.
These permanent villages or hamlets were the focal point of family activity
despite occasional forays to forage or hunt. They were necessarily permanent
because of the need to work fields during planting and harvesting and protect
stored foods between harvesting seasons. Because most activity was centered
around the hamlets, these locations yield the most obvious archeological
remains. Artifact assemblages, subjected to functional analysis, predictably
will reflect the relative degree of permanency.

156

Texas Archeological Society

Agricultural activity was largely a community enterprise. However, early
chroniclers were not specific as to land clearing methods or how many years it
took to exhaust a particular field. Although described as swidden or slashand-burn agriculture (Anderson et al., 1974:1), actual farming methods
largely are unknown. Presumably, settlements frequently were moved as
needed to open new fields, replacing old, exhausted ones. Former fields may
have later become settlements; former Archaic encampments may have become fields or locations for hamlets; locations of former hamlets may have
been choice locations for later fields. Critical resource localities such as those
used for the procurement of nuts, fish, lithics, etc. likely would have been
used by both adaptive systems.
Land use practices of the two systems, while qualitatively different, predictably would overlap to some degree given the 6,000-7,000 years of prehistoric activity; favored localities critical to settlement trends of both systems
would be the most visible archeologically. These sites also would show a
mixing of assemblages. Special activity locations such as a traditional stopping
place for a passing group of hunters, or where a family group might choose to
fish at a favored spot, would likely either be masked by activities of previous or
subsequent groups or be beneath the level of archeological visibility, especially surface surveys.
Findings from the previous archeological survey and excavations indicate
that the most frequently encountered sites in the area are Frankston Focus
hamlets. The suggested explanation for their high frequency is due to their
being hamlets which were occupied only long enough to exhaust sufficiently
the fields located in the proximity. The population density, while several times
that of the Archaic Period, probably was never very high. Due to the frequent
shifting of the settlements during the 300-400 years spanned by the Frankston Focus, a large number of settlement sites resulted from this pattern. More
permanent and specialized community integrating sites such as the A. C.
Saunders (Jackson, 1936) and Pace McDonald (Story, 1981) mound complexes served to maintain a quasistratified social structure. These sites most
likely represent temple precincts that served a catchment of hamlets in the
proximity.
The relative duration of the hamlets can be measured by the number of
graves in the cemeteries and relative temporal placement of each hamlet can
be determined by seriating mortuary assemblages. Given the prehistoric land
use practices and transformation processes operating on the East Texas
cultural resources, short term foraging of hunting locales predictably would lie
beneath the level of archeological visibility. Nevertheless, models for late
Caddoan settlement, subsistence, and procurement behaviors can be formulated and tested with a rigidly designed and realistic sampling program combined with analytical techniques aimed at delineating the functional realms of
the surviving material culture elements.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
Despite the extensively displaced condition of the archeological materials
observed during the first inspection, additional investigations were warranted. Field investigations were aimed toward achieving several objectives:
1) test the area where the Attaways had recovered the pottery vessels to
determine if additional, intact materials were present and if grave outlines
could be detected in the underlying clay; 2) test the intact portion of the knoll
between the beach and crest in an attempt to locate undisturbed midden
deposits; and 3) make an extensive surface collection along the beach in
order to retrieve a representative sample of ceramics and lithics.
These objectives were fulfilled. Although the site was found to be almost
completely destroyed by wave action and inundation, data were recovered
that allowed for a confident assessment of the site with regard to its cultural
identity and function. Furthermore, new information on mortuary behavior
and ceramic vessel function for the Frankston Focus was gained.
Description of Work
Three 2 m test pits were placed selectively between the crest of the knoll
and the present bluff line to search for in situ midden materials (Fig. 4). These
test pits were excavated in 15 cm arbitrary levels; the bottom of each level was
troweled and examined for cultural features. Sterile clay was encountered
between 30 and 45 cm in each of the test pits and only a trace of cultural
material was observed.
A concentration of sherds and flakes interpreted as a midden area was
observed along the shoreline 30 m north of the area where the Attaway find
was made. Both surface and screened samples were made to recover a representative collection. The sampling involved screening heavy fraction beach
erosion debris using I/4 in hardware cloth to recover smaller lithic items. Excavation units were not established since the materials were not in situ.
Cemetery Area
The area designated by the Attaway find was assumed to be a cemetery
area since complete ceramic vessels typically mark such situations in the late
prehistoric Caddoan sites (Johnson, 1961). The near absence of midden
refuse except for an occasional sherd or flake along the shore would argue for
a specifically designated mortuary area removed from village activity. Test
pits were placed to examine for traces of burial pit outlines which may have
penetrated the erosion resistant basal clay formation.
Excavation in the cemetery area consisted of establishing several arbitrarily
sized units, 1 x 2 or I x 1 m, in an area adjacent to the Attaway finds. These
test units, labelled A - G, were excavated in one level, usually about 10 cm in
depth, removing the redeposited beach sand down to sterile clay. Two disturbances, designated as Features I and 2, were recorded, which confirmed the
existence of burial pits. A general plan of this excavation is shown in Figures 4
and 5.

158

Texas Archeological Society

FEATURE 1
This feature consisted of a slight pit disturbance, interpreted as being a
burial pit remnant, that extended approximately 10 cm into the basal clay.
The feature was located across the southern end of Unit C and extended
slightly into adjoining units E, F, and G (Fig. 5). The pit contained the following items tightly clustered together: four Fulton Aspect effigy vessels, one
large carinated Poynor Engraved bowl, one Iongneck Poynor engraved bottle
(Fig. 10), one flare rim elbow pipe (Fig. 9E), and a cluster of nine Perdiz arrow
points (Fig. 7).
The arrow points were tightly grouped and pointing approximately west.
The north edge of the pit disturbance also suggested a general east-west
orientation for the grave. If the arrow points were part of a quiver and the
arrow shafts were parallel to the long axis of the grave, then their placement
would correlate with the grave orientation.
The mortuary assemblage also may provide some indication of the
individual’s status in life. The function and symbolism of the four effigy vessels, carinated bowl, and bottle are unknown; but the pipe and arrow points
may signify that the individual was a male.
FEATURE 2
A remnant of another burial pit was located in Unit D (Fig. 5). A small,
crudely executed Poynor Engraved bowl was the only surviving artifact.

ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE
The intrasite context for most of the artifactual material generally is poor,
having been displaced by erosion and recovered from the beach area. However, the assemblage is revealing and provides data on late Caddoan behavioral patterns. Brief descriptions of the artifacts are presented; taxonomic
designations follow those of Suhm et al. (1954) and Suhm and Jelks (1962).
If data on the original vertical position of the artifacts were available, temporal changes might be observable in the lithic and ceramic samples. Such
data are largely missing due to both natural and recently man made (i.e.,
rising waters of Lake Palestine) transformations of the archeological situation.
General horizontal information was maintained, however, by sorting the artifacts by their respective provenience lots. These lots included Test Pits and
Trench A (grouped together), Mortuary Area, and Midden Area. Sorting on
this basis served to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative differences between the midden and mortuary areas.

Lithic Artifacts
The lithic collection contains a small sample of bifacial artifacts (mostly
stemmed projectile points), two pitted stones, and a moderate sampling of
flaking debitage. Examples of lithic artifacts are illustrated to scale in figures 6
and 7; general horizontal provenience is provided in Table 1.

PII~CES ESQUILLI~ES (N = 1)
This small specimen is a tan chert flake exhibiting bipolar battering similar to that described
elsewhere as pi~ces esquill~es (or battered bipolar pieces) (Shafer, 1973:112, 113). Battering is
the direct result of simultaneous impact on both ends, suggesting that the specimen was used as a
wedge.

PITTED STONES (N = 2)
Both of these are small cobbles exhibiting a single depression or pit on one surface. One is of
ferrugenous sandstone with a pit measuring 3 cm in diameter and 5 mm deep. The second
specimen is of hematite, with a pit measuring 2.5 cm in diameter and 5 mm in depth.

DEBITAGE (N = 832)
The debitage is listed in Table I by category and material. Debitage consists of residual flake
materials resulting from reduction of cores or bifaces during the course of tool manufacture.
Flakes reveal specific atlxibutes of both the parent core and kind of percussor used. Flake terminology follows that of Shafer (1973:83-95).
The most striking thing about the 41HEl14 debitage sample is that the flakes are almost
exclusively the residue of biface thinning, a marked contrast to the findings at the George C.
Davis site (Shafer; 1973:118). Biface blanks were relatively large to begin with and the thinning
technique was soft hammer flaking. This procedure is indicated by lipped striking platforms
produced by the characteristic bending fracture associated with the use of a soft hammer.
Most of the chert represented by the soft hammer flakes is intrusive tan and gray material. The
gray chert varies considerably in color but includes specks of white fossiliferous inclusions, blue
black with olive specks, opaque gray without fossils, and gray translucent chert. Virtually identical cherts were observed by the author in the Leon River drainage in Bell and Coryell counties
and along Hog Creek and Bosque River in McLennen County. The thinning flakes rarely retain
remnants of cortex of the parent core.
The preponderance of soft hammer flakes produced by thinning large biface preforms may
suggest an intermediate step in an exchange system operating through this portion of the Neches
River Valley. The absence of primary flaking debris of intrusive cherts, high incidence of interior
flakes without cortex, and biface failures may indicate that preforms were imported in a thinned,
but unfinished state. The cache of chert bifaces from George C. Davis (Shafer, 1973:235-237)
made of annealed chert possibly from western Bell County is an example of the kind of staging
indicated in the Attaway site debitage. Very large chert bifaces were recovered from archeologically contemporary sites in east Texas (Jackson, 1938); source of these intrusive objects has not
been documented.
The debitage sample is very revealing especially in terms of technology and the amount of
intrusive material. The use of local resources, namely small chert pebbles, silicified wood, and
fine grained quartzite, is meager. This situation suggests that the Caddoan occupants of the
Attaway site had ready access to excellent quality cherts from Central Texas. Precisely how these
were acquired is not known; but identifiable Caddoan ceramics, including elbow pipes, are
known from the sheltered canyons of the Leon River in Bell and Coryell counties (Miller and
Jelks, 1952), the area where the cherts occur.

BURNED QUARTZITE (N = 51)
Fragments of burned quartzite, presumably the result of quartzite being used for heat conducting purposes, were recovered from the midden area. The quartzite specimens were small cobbles
evidently collected from nearby gravel deposits.

Ceramic ArtT"facts
The ceramic sample consisted of sherds recovered from test excavations
and surface collections and complete or restorable vessels from the mortuary

area. The source for the major portion of the sherd sample is the midden
located about 30 m north of the burial area. Sherds from the midden area are
given special attention to test for behavioral differences that presumably relate
to household use on one hand and to vessel selection for burial lots on the
other. Contextual data for the ceramics are less than ideal due to three major
factors: absence of vertical provenience data; displaced nature of the mortuary assemblage which prevented sorting out most individual grave lots and
preventing a thorough examination for sexual and status differences; and
eroded nature of the sherds sample preventing sorting into confident typological units.
Special attention is given in the analysis to vessel form and mode of decoration characteristic of each form. The assumption is that form and possibly
mode of decoration are somehow related to function. Since the ceramic sample is derived from two behavioral contexts, midden and mortuary, it may be
possible to relate the differences between the assemblages to behavioral (i.e.,
functional) differences. For example, further assuming that the midden sample is a function of household use of ceramics and the frequency of breakage
for a particular vessel form is related to the frequency and manner of its use,
then the midden sample expectedly would yield a high number of vessels that
functioned in daily household activities (Anderson et al., 1974:7-10). The
mortuary sample, on the other hand, represents an entirely different set of
selective behaviors and is biased by choices of those individuals responsible
for its original selection.
Attempts to assign function to Caddoan ceramics are met with severe constraints due to several factors. Foremost is the lack of preservation of good
archeological context for household assemblages or for any assemblage outside of mortuary contexts. Subfloor caches and floor context pottery virtually
are nonexistent in the Caddoan area; thus preventing the recovery of
ceramics from primary functional contexts such as sometimes encountered in
the American Southwest. Furthermore, ethnographic details on ceramic use
especially are meager.
Ethnographic sources note that large earthenware pots were used for cooking and storage (Swanton, 1942:157-158~ Griffith, 1954:102). Griffith
(1954:104) states that "The Indians fashioned large vessels for the storage of
water and for cooking, and smaller ones resembling crocks, bowls, and
plates, for cooking and serving."
Major data sources for determining artifact function are wear patterns and
residue stains on sherds and vessels (Shafer and Taylor, 1980). Preservation
of organic materials on pottery in East Texas generally is poor. Sherd surfaces
typically are eroded to the extent that use wear almost always is absent. The
only exception occurs on vessels extensively used in cooking liquid foods
where a sooty residue is preserved on the exterior.
Despite these handicaps in making functional assessments, one source of
preserved information that can be used to define functional sets is form. Roles
within sets, however, cannot be specifically defined. Vessel forms represented in the Attaway site sample are shown in Figure 8. They are grouped
into four basic sets: bowls, jars, bottles, and pipes.
Three bowl forms are present: carinated bowls with high rims that typically
are curved or slant inward (Fig. 8B~ Poynor Engraved) or outward (Fig. 8A;

168

Texas Archeological Society

Taylor Engraved); bowls with high, straight, or out flaring rims with small
bodies (Fig. 8D, E); and effigy bowls (Fig. 8C). Bowls are engraved and
formal types included Poynor for forms A, B, and D; Taylor Engraved for
forms A and E; and Ripley Engraved for form D (Fig. 8). Traces of red or
white pigment characteristically occur in engraved lines; examples of the effigy form (C) have traces of red pigment. Bowls presumably functioned for
serving and possibly for storage (large bowls) based on ethnographic (Griffith,
1954:102, 104) and form considerations.
Jars occur in two forms: a deep jar with an out flaring rim; and cylindrical
jars with approximately straight or slightly out curved rims. Jars sometimes
are outfitted with strap handles, lugs, or nodes. Decoration always was applied while the paste was wet. It includes such modes as brushing, incising,
punctating, pinching, combination punctating-incising with brushing, punctating with brushing, and incising with brushing. Rims may be decorated by
incising, punctating-incising, punctating, neck banding, pinching, or brushing. Bodies most often are brushed but also may be punctated or pinched.
Formal types probably include Maydelle Incised, LaRue Neck Banded, and
Killough Pinched.
Jars may have functioned in several capacities, depending upon their size.
Large jars may have served in cooking, heating, and storage. Cooking is
demonstrable on the basis of sooty residue observed on the jar shown in
Figure 9D; this may have been the main function served by jars of this particular form (Linton, 1944). Decorative modes which occur on jars result in
roughening the exterior to increase the surface area possibly to aid in heat
absorption. Smaller jars may have been used to reheat small quantities of
food although direct evidence of this is lacking except for the presence of strap
handles or lugs. These may have aided in removing vessels from the fire or
suspending the vessel over a fire.
Bottles also occur in two basic forms. One is a cylindrical, slightly constricted form with a short neck and an out flaring rim (Fig. 8H.). The second
form (Fig. 81) is characterized by a long neck and globular body. Both have flat
bases. Decorative motifs exclusively are engraved and usually embellished
with red pigment in the lines.
Pipes are typically elbow forms with short stems and flared bowls.

SHERD SAMPLE (N = 2494)
Sherds were sorted largely on the basis of decorative mode: brushed, incised, engraved, etc~
These data are listed in Table 2 by major provenience lots (i.e., Test Pits, Burial Area, Midden);
spatial relationship of these lots is shown in Figure 4. Test pits and Trench A are peripheral to the
burial and midden area and yielded only a trace of refuse. The major comparable samples came
from the midden area.
Formal type classification was recognizable (but not always quantifiable) for certain sherds and
includes Poynor Engraved, Hume Engraved, Maydelle Incised, LaRue Neck Banded, Killough
Pinched, and Fulton Aspect effigy bowls~ Vessel forms represented in the midden sample include
bowl forms A, B, and C; jar forms F and possibly G~ and pipe form J. A wide range of vessel
forms may be present but vessel identification is made difficult by the small size and eroded nature
of most sherds. Bottles, for example, are based on technological attributes but frequency to other
engraved vessels cannot be measured. Rim forms are used as the most confident guide for vessel
classification along with mode of decoration.
The sherd sample outside the midden area is small and therefore excluded from further
analysis. Sherds from the midden comprise the bulk of the sample. These sherds are assumed to

be the product of household activities and therefore given special attention. The total midden
sample is 2452 sherds. Since most of these have been subjected to beach erosion, their condition
usually is poor. Eroded specimens that could not be sorted further numbered 237 specimens and
were subtracted from the overall total giving a working sample of 2215 sherds.
Sherds whose decorative techniques were applied while the paste was wet, a characteristic of
jars (brushing, incising, punctating, pinching, neck banding), account for over 60% of the total.
Engraved and effigy sherds characteristic of bowls account for less than 5% of the sample. The
predominant vessel form represented in the midden is the jar while bowls and bottles are rare.
Pipes occur but also are rare.

MORTUARY ASSEMBLAGE (N = 22)
The mortuary sample consists of data on a total of 21 pottery vessels and one pipe. Fourteen
of the vessels are from the Attaway collection; the remainder and pipe are in the TAMU sample.
Descriptive data on these vessels admittedly are poor due to several factors. The Attaway sample
was not available for reanalysis at the time of report preparation; original photographic records
are incomplete. The TAMU vessels either have not been restored or are too fragmentary for
restoration. Only minimal metric data are available. Information on the vessels include formal
type designation, vessel form description, and measurements on the TAMU vessels. Certain
vessels are illustrated to approximate scale in Figures 9-12. Vessel measurements are presented
in Table 3.

BOTTLES (N = 3)
Two bottles were recovered from the Attaway and one from the TAMU investigations. Two
are Form I and have long necks and globular bodies; one is an elongated Form H bottle. The two
Form I specimens are Poynor Engraved (Figs. 9A, 10) and the Form H specimen is plain.

JARS (N = 3)
Jars are from the Attaway collection. One is Form F exhibiting a punctated-incised rim decoration and a lightly brushed body (Fig. 9D). It is classified as Maydelle Incised. A second sample is
a variant of Form F. It is a small jar with a band of random fingernail punctation around the rim
and two small, thick loop handles. The third specimen is a Form G jar, nearly cylindrical in form
with random punctation over much of the exterior surface. The rim on this specimen is approximately straight.

BOWLS (N = 15)
Four carinated bowls are from the Attaway collection. One of the bowls is Form A and the
remainder are Form B. Form B specimens are Poynor Engraved while the Form A example is
classified as a Taylor Engraved bowl. Four of the carinated bowls also are large (over 35 cm in
maximum rim diameter) and two are small (less than 15 cm in maximum rim diameter).
Form C effigy bowls constitute the largest single vessel category and number eight specimens,
four from each collection. They have opposed appendages but most were broken, either from
use or by wave action. The surviving appendages are contrasting. One side displays a cockscomb
effigy while the opposite side is a fiat tab or tail effigy (Fig. 11). These bowls appear to be bird
effigy vessels. Another characteristic is the presence of three or four broad engraved lines
enhanced by red ochre encircling the rim. These lines usually terminate at the appendages. Form
C bowls characteristically are deep with fiat bottoms and straight rims.
Form E bowls are represented by two specimens, both from the Attaway collection. One (Fig.
12A) has a short rim that joins a globular body and is engraved with a well executed circle within
an extended circle motif. This bowl probably is a well executed Poynor Engraved example. The
second specimen has a higher rim that flares outward slightly and a globular body (Fig, 12B). The
design is a circle with an engraved cross within a series of partial circles, a motif characteristic of
Ripley Engraved. The design is repeated four times around the vessels.

The Form E bowl (Fig. 9C) is from the Attaway collection. It has a high, out flaring rim and
short, globular body. The rim exhibits an engraved band consisting of a series of interlocking
scrolls. Both the vessel form and the design are characteristic of Taylor Engraved.

PIPE (N = 1)
The pipe (Fig. 9E) is an elbow form with a flared bowl. The base or heel of the pipe is sharply
angled in profile and rounded when viewed from above. It is decorated with five rows of tiny
punctations extending from the midline of the bowl around the end of the opposite side. Three
raised bands of punctations form the collar for the stem. Jackson (1936:168) notes that pipes of
this form are late in the midden at the A.C. Saunders site, which seems to be an exclusively
Frankston Focus deposit. Assuming that Jackson’s (1936) chronological trend is correct, the pipe
may signal a late Frankston Focus placement for the site.

SUMMARY
Archeological investigations at the Attaway site revealed the presence of a
badly disturbed late Caddoan settlement which yielded ceramics and other
artifacts diagnostic of a Frankston Focus assemblage (Suhm et al., 1954:184189). The site was first recorded during the course of a SMU survey of the
Lake Palestine basin and was defined as a sherd scatter. This assessment was
based on only a brief surface inspection of the locality and not confirmed by
subsurface investigations. The TAMU investigation revealed two spatially and
functionally separate activity areas within the site (midden area and cemetery
area), each exposed by beach erosion. Test excavations confirmed the existence of burial pits in the cemetery area but failed to locate undisturbed midden
deposits.
Artifact assemblage includes both lithic and ceramic specimens. The lithic
sample consists mostly of debitage produced by retouching large biface preforms of imported chert. It is suggested that this hamlet also participated in an
exchange system that involved, among other things, acquiring biface preforms from Central Texas and reducing and trading them to other villages that
had little or lacked access to Central Texas cherts. Certain residual flakes
subsequently were utilized either as tools or were fashioned into stemmed
arrow points. Several dart point specimens were found in the lithic sample
from the midden area. These may represent either a thin Archaic scatter on
the knoll or items collected by the late Caddoan peoples for raw material.
Evidence of an extensive Archaic occupation at the site is lacking.
Ceramics were recovered from both the eroded midden area and the cemetery. The ceramic analysis was directed at determining functionally separate
areas within the site that could provide information on the more general
nature of the site itself. Sherd analysis from the midden indicated that most
vessels were jars decorated by wet paste techniques (e.g., brushing, incising,
punctating, neck banding, pinching, etc.). Bowls and bottle sherds were uncommon. Formal types represented in the midden included Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed, Killough Pinched, Poynor Engraved, LaRue Neck
Banded, and Fulton Aspect effigy bowls.
Twenty one vessels were recovered from the cemetery area as a result of
the investigations by both the Attaways and TAMU. Bowls represent the
predominant form and Fulton Aspect effigy bowls notably were common (8
of 21 vessels). Four bowls were recovered from Feature 1, a burial pit. Three
jars were recovered from the cemetery. Pottery types in the mortuary as-

Sharer - Attaway Site

175

semblage included Poynor Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Ripley Engraved,
Fulton Aspect effigy vessels, and Maydelle Incised.
It was not possible to determine precisely how many individual graves were
once present in the cemetery. The TAMU investigations located the remains
of two burial pits and the Attaways located what they described as "three
clusters of vessels." These clusters may represent individual grave lots. If so,
at least five graves may have been present in the cemetery, doubtfully more
than seven judging from the small size.
The two ceramic lots were contemporaneous. Differences in forms represented in the two areas are attributed to differences in the related behaviors
that produced the respective ceramic samples. The high percentage of jars in
the midden compared to the low percentage of engraved bowls or bottles is
attributed to the frequency and nature of jar uses in the everyday life of these
late Caddoan peoples. Bowls and bottles probably were represented equally
in a household assemblage at any one point in time but jar use was such that
these vessels were more likely to be broken. Lack of preservation of Caddoan
house floors and associated artifact assemblages negates the opportunity of
constructing a comparable household assemblage of vessels from archeological data that might be represented in a house at any one time.
The mortuary sample, by contrast, represents a much more biased sample
with regard to Caddoan behavior as each vessel was specifically selected for
use as burial furniture. Some may have been containers but others, such as
two effigy vessels from Feature 1, seemingly were placed one in the other.
Why certain vessels were selected for burial inclusion will never be known; but
a factor analysis of mortuary assemblages in the Frankston and Titus foci
areas might reveal a common sequence of vessel selection. It may be that the
mortuary assemblages were intended to mirror a mini-household assemblage
envisioned to take care of the needs of that specific individual.
Sexual status also may be a factor in vessel selection. It seems to have at
least partly determined the assemblage of nonceramic artifacts such as pipes,
arrow point clusters, and celts, all of which presumably denote male status.
The function of certain pottery vessels such as the effigy bowls is unknown.
Anderson et al. (1974:Figure 10) suggested that these vessels were incense
burners but evidence to support this function is lacking. The characteristic
deep form and straight rim with opposed appendages should perhaps be
viewed as being something other than merely aesthetic ornaments.
Dating the remains at the Attaway site within the temporal span of the
Frankston Focus is tenuous at best. Chronometric dating techniques have not
been applied to Frankson Focus material, further complicating the dating. A
review of the dates for the various Caddoan ceramic assemblages to better
assess the temporal placement for the Frankston Focus is beyond the scope of
this study. Ninety seven radiocarbon dates were reported from George C.
Davis, an early Caddoan site (Story and Valestro, 1977; Creel, 1979). Statistical analysis of these data allowed Story and Valestro (1977) to date confidently the Davis site Caddoan occupation from A.D. 780 - A.D. 1260.
The origin of the Frankston Focus population is unknown. Evolution from
the Alto Focus populations at the Davis site (Story 1972, 1981) is not demonstrable. The earliest Caddoan settlements in the upper Neches are few and

176

Texas Archeological Society

seem to correlate with the Davis site occupation with regard to similarities in
ceramics. Story (1981) argues that the Davis site settlement was established
by agricultural peoples moving westward from the Red River Valley. It is
possible that the Frankston Focus peoples followed the same course or
perhaps were from the Sabine Valley. Some time overlap cannot be ruled
out. However, since Alto ceramics are absent from Frankston Focus sites, it is
assumed that the latter settlements are temporally separate. Furthermore, the
Frankston Focus settlements probably date after A.D. 1300, possibly after
A.D. 1400.
By seriating ceramic attributes from specimens obtained from pure and
mixed Frankston and Allen foci sites, Shafer (1968) was able to demonstrate
a general evolution from one assemblage to the other. Allen Focus sites are
associated with European trade materials and therefore are assumed to date
sometime after A.D. 1650. Given these minimum and maximum age ranges,
it is possible to tentatively place the Frankston Focus in the time between A.D.
1300 and A.D. 1650.
Eventually, it may be possible to identify temporal variability within the
Frankston Focus with more detailed attribute studies on ceramics available
from mortuary and midden samples. An attribute study conducted in 1968
(Shafer, 1968) was on mortuary vessels from five sites in the upper Neches
Valley: Omer and Otis Hood, J. M. Cook, Freeman, Jim Allen, and Patton.
Results of this analysis allowed a temporal seriation of the five sites.
Attempts were made to compare the ceramic attributes from the Attaway
site with those in Shafer (1968). Attaway ceramic attributes more closely
compare to those of the Omer and Otis Hood site which was the earliest of the
five in the study sample. This information does not provide any indication of
the relative age of the Attaway site, but only that of the five sites, the ceramics
compare closer as an assemblage to the Hood site. Sites used in the 1968
study lie south of the Lake Palestine basin. The northern location of the
Attaway site may help to explain the occurrence of presumably intrusive
ceramics from assemblages (Titus Focus) located along Cypress Creek
(Suhm et al, 1954:189-190).

CONCLUDING STATEMENT
Archeological remains at the Attaway site are interpreted as being those of
a small late Caddoan farming hamlet. The settlement was occupied long
enough for a recognizable midden area to accumulate and for the family
groups to bury an estimated five to seven individuals in the associated cemetery. The temporal duration of the occupation is unknown but doubtfully
would be more than two generations.

The author was contacted in the fall of 1975 by Susan Forsgard, then a Texas A & M University (TAMU) anthropology student from Tyler, and informed of an archeological find along the
shores of Lake Palestine, Two residents from Tyler, Jim and Sally Attaway, had discovered

Sharer - Attaway Site

several Caddoan pottery vessels eroding from the shoreline along the western portion of the lake.
Further exploration by them revealed several more vessels. The Attaways recognized the relative
importance of the find, notified Forsgard of their discovery, and agreed to accompany representatives from TAMU to the site for further investigations.
The effort to salvage archeological data from a late prehistoric site exposed along the shores of
Lake Palestine was made possible by the awareness shown by the Attaways. Whatever significance this project may have on illuminating facets of late Caddoan prehistory or bringing to light
archeological mistakes of the past in the upper Neches River region, the credit belongs to them.
The participation by all individuals involved in this project was strictly on a volunteer basis.
Field work was conducted on two weekends during October, 1975, by members of the Aggie
Anthropological Society headed by Thomas Stearns and operating under the overall supervision
of the author. TAMU students who contributed their time and energy to the field work include
Donna Chapman, Kathy Cushman, Susan Forsgard, Stan Grysinski, Elaine Hughes, John Ippolito, John Oeffinger, Lawrence Rearick, Reed Smith, and Thomas Stearns. Laboratory processing was facilitated by Elaine Hughes, Mary McMillan, Lisa Niederauer, and John Oeffinger. Staff
archeologist Edward P. Baxter coordinated much of the field activity. Roger Coleman drafted
figures 1-4 and prepared the artifact drawings for figure 6.
Since the site location was on land under the jurisdiction of the Upper Neches River Municipal
Water Authority, an application was made to acquire an antiquities permit in the event that
artifact collections or subsurface investigations were warranted. Antiquities Permit 98 was issued
by the Antiquities Committee to TAMU allowing further investigations at the site.
The interest and assistance shown by all of those individuals mentioned above are greatly
appreciated. The ideas, interpretations, and shortcomings of the report, are, however, solely
those of the author.

ABSTRACT
A method is described for efficiently recording seasonality characteristics from the shell of the
temperate, estuarine clam Rangia cuneata (Gray) as it occurs archeologically on the coast of the
northern Gulf of Mexico. The seasonal growth stage morphology is classified according to the
ratio of most recent growth to the extent of a full year’s growth. This classification is applied to a
sample of 50 shells and resulting frequency distribution of growth stages compared to a master
sequence. The master sequence is based on modern collections of R. cuneata. A match between
archeological and master sequence samples is used to infer seasonality of the archeological shells
and their context. The range of error is ± 1 month.

INTRODUCTION
Shell middens are peerless as a comprehensive record of the historical
interaction between man and nature in coastal zones. However, they are
reaching an attenuated state as a result of thousands of years of erosion by
nature and centuries of exploitation by man for road and building construction materials. This situation is particularly serious since shell middens are one
of the most prolific sources of cultural and environmental information. Many
archeological observations of molluscs and other shell midden materials are
convertible to baseline data about the status of coastal environments prior to
the alteration of worldwide air and water chemistry by industrial societies
beginning in the 19th Century. Because of this, middens which do remain are
increasing in value as a national resource for environmental monitoring.
Shell middens have many interpretive advantages. Aside from the mollusc
shell, which itself is a major data source, the carbonate enriched sediment
enables near total preservation of bone material. The shell matrix discourages
burrowing animals and limits effects of solifluction. The shell bulk dilutes
time/space volumetric relationships of deposition so that small temporal increments of archeological deposits can be documented. The often waterlogged condition of these sites enhances the retention of seldom preserved
materials such as uncarbonized seeds, cordage, bark, and wood. From observation of midden shell condition, morphology, structure, composition, and
demography, conclusions may be drawn about:
1. Radiocarbon age of the shells and their context;
2. Time or season of year shellfish collection occurred;
3. Qualitative and quantitative dietary contribution;
4. Differentiating separate occupational episodes;

180

Texas Archeological Society

5. Identifying hearth and other activity features within occupational episodes;

6. Effects of human predation on shellfish populations;
7. Postdepositional climatic history of a site and its immediate area;
8. History of clam habitat water chemistry;
9. High resolution reconstruction of the region’s paleotemperature record;
I0. Evolution of estuaries and other landforms.
As a corollary to investigation of shell middens on the upper Texas coast,
several of these questions were studied as they pertain to the temperate,
estuarine, epifaunal clam Rangia cuneata (Gray) within that portion of its
range located on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Andrews,
1971:186). An analysis of the use of R. cuneata for radiocarbon dating is
available (Aten, 1979:Appendix A).
Results of investigations into determining the collection season of Rangia
cuneata shells are presented. The ability to evaluate collection time represents
a potential for precisely controlling settlement scheduling and related questions for possibly 80% of the shell middens within the coastal zone of Texas
and Louisiana. Brief descriptions of this procedure were published previously
in Aten (1972, 1976, 1977), Dillehay (1975), Gilmore (1974), and McGuff
(1978). Other applications of R. cuneata to archeological problems remain

A basic observation on the growth of organisms is that they manifest cyclical
features. These cycles reflect metabolic responses to environmental and
physiological conditions of greater or lesser duration. At a major scale, rates
of growth or metabolic function respond to phases of the life cycle; while near
the opposite extreme of scale, growth responds to diurnal cycles. The question arises, therefore, whether this property of organisms, as documented in
mollusc shells, can be used on Gulf coast archeological problems for which
relatively precise determinations of season are required. General introductions to pelecypod shell growth are available (Rhoads and Pannella, 1970;
Barker, 1970; Berta, 1976; Kennish and Olsson, 1975; Rosenberg and Runcorn, 1975).
Approaches to seasonality analysis may be categorized as either chemical,
structural, morphological, or demographic. Chemical techniques (Shackleton, 1973; Killingley, 1981) measure oxygen isotope ratios to determine
water temperature at the time shell was formed. A series of mass spectrometer measurements are made on a shell to construct a temperature curve from
which collection season is inferred. This procedure is essential for paleotemperature research, but for archeological purposes it is technologically complex. The method is useful primarily on specimens from temperate climates
and its accuracy can be matched by other techniques.
Structural methods involve cutting a shell parallel to its width and examining the growth increments in the cross section either through thin section or
acetate peel (Coutts, 1970; Coutts and Higham, 1971; Koike, 1975; Rhoads
and Pannella, 1970). The method involves counting the daily increments of
growth between two periods of annual growth interruption. Because of prob-

Aten - Rangia cuneata

181

lems in identifying and interpreting the daily increments, an error of from I to
3 months is possible. Moreover, the daily and annual growth increments in
the shell are manifested best when there are strong warm and cold temperature cycles. Consequently, this method is less effective on subtidal and tropical species.
Morphological methods are practical when cyclical environmental variations in the mollusc habitat are sufficiently pronounced that gross morphology
of the shell is affected (Aten, 1972; Coutts and Higham, 1971; Weide,
1969). These methods compare the proportion of most recent growth to the
total annual growth increment. Under appropriate conditions, morphological
techniques can easily duplicate the level of precision attainable with structural
techniques. They probably are the simplest procedures now available and
have the particular advantage of being usable while in the field.
Demographic methods are based on changes in the mean shell size of a
shellfish population; this will cycle as juveniles grow larger and adults die.
Although the method is simple, its archeological applications are limited. For
small, short lived species such as the coquina, Donax variabilis, the results
(Miller, 1980) appear comparable to the morphological and structural
methods. For larger species (including Rangia cuneata) with several age
classes in the population, this technique probably would give a much less
satisfactory result. If the shellfish population was being collected intensively,
size data and seasonality conclusions would be confounded by predation
effects (Swadling, 1976).
Because Rangia cuneata is a temperate species with prominent growth
related shell morphology, a morphological technique was developed for
seasonality analysis. The approach is technologically simple, relatively fast,
and yields results as precise as the structural methods. R. cuneata is a practical
species to use because once it has settled on the water bottom as a juvenile
clam, it has total osmoregulatory ability. It can adjust its blood salinity to that
of the environment, thereby keeping its growth functionally unaffected by
significant changes in habitat salinity (Hopkins et al., 1973:70-74). This important adaptive capability limits the effects of environmental phenomena,
such as storms and neap tides, which act on shellfish physiology to inhibit shell
growth through creation of major salinity changes in the clam habitat.
Morphological seasonality methods require an understanding of pelecypod growth features. There are a variety of growth increments on mollusc
shell, from a few microns to several millimeters in width, all of which have
physiological, environmental, and/or chronological significance. These reflect subdaily, daily, tidal, lunar month, and annual growth periodicity (Kennish and Olsson, 1975:52).
Evidence of other phenomena causing growth reductions and interruptions is superimposed on patterns of shell growth: freeze shocks, heat shocks,
spawning breaks, storm breaks, and neap tide breaks (Kennish and Olsson,
1975). Each of these is characterized by distinctive patterns of growth prior
and subsequent to the growth interruption. Therefore, many of the environmental conditions of the shellfish habitat and, indirectly, those of the region,
are identifiable by the growth patterns preserved in the shell structure,
morphology, and composition. Principal tasks in a morphological approach

182

are to identify, amidst the noise of other growth and interruption features, the
annual growth increment and the proportion of this annual increment represented by the most recent period of growth prior to its death (collection).

METHOD
This method provides a systematic basis for classifying individual valves of
Rangia cuneata into growth stage classes employing macroscopic observational techniques. It has two basic parts: identification of annual growth increments which ordinarily are separated by a narrow, indented band around the
shell marking the annual growth interruption; and determination of which
stage in this cycle is represented by the most recent growth. For purposes of
orientation, typical R. cuneata shell morphology is shown in Figure 1A.
Through inspection and comparison with the age/length data in Table 1, it
usually is possible to identify, tentatively at least, one of the annual growth
interruption rings because of its dimension and/or prominence. Ordinarily,
second or third year rings are the easiest to recognize. A pair of sliding calipers
are set at the interval separating the tentatively identified annual ring and an
adjacent prominent growth ring. By moving up and down the growth axis
(i.e., width) of the valve, it can be seen if this interval matches additional
major rings.
If the measured interval between the rings in question matches prominent
rings over the entire width of the shell, then an annual growth increment
match likely has been made. If this interval does not match prominent rings
for the entire valve, then the annual ring sequence probably has not been
correctly identified. If this occurs, another tentative annual growth interval
should be selected and the procedure repeated.
Although there are exceptions, only two types of important growth interruption rings usually have to be distinguished on Rangia cuneata. These rings
are the major growth reduction or interruption ring associated with the cold
season; and a less frequent and shorter duration thermal shock interruption
ring apparently associated with high water temperatures of July and August.
The summer season ring usually is less prominent morphologically and occurs (if at all) near the middle of the annual growth increment.
One can often match across most of the shell width, more or less equal
intervals between winter and summer interruptions. For this reason, it is important to count the number of these rings to estimate the age of the shellfish.
Then shell length is measured at the last growth interruption ring and an age
estimate of the shellfish is derived from Table 1. If the summer increments
were mistaken for a cold season growth interruption, the clam will appear to
be nearly twice as old, by growth ring count, than the result from Table 1. The
average annual increment of growth is not exactly the same for all years in the
shellfish’s life cycle. The amount of difference from year to year, however, is
not great (Table 2) and does not obstruct analysis so long as the point is not
overlooked.
This method for evaluating annual ring increments is illustrated in Figure
lB. For demonstration purposes only, the sample valve shown in profile is

taken to measure 45 mm in length. A shell 45 mm in length can be estimated
to be in its fourth year of growth (Table 1). Growth increments roughly in the
middle of the valve can be matched (Fig. 1B). However, in going towards the
earlier and later growth periods, comparable matching growth interruption
rings are lacking. It is possible for an annual ring occasionally to be manifested
very slightly and to escape recognition; but it is rare for this situation to occur
repeatedly on a single valve. An evaluation based on matches in the small,
middle segment shown in the lower portion of Figure 1B is dubious and
probably represents misidentification of summer thermal shock interruptions
as major cold season annual rings.
The evaluation can be checked further by counting the putative annual
rings, including interpolation for missing rings. That count would indicate the

clam in the example was 8 years old when collected. This estimate is twice the
age indicated from Table 1 and far exceeds a reasonable estimate of age
based on the growth curve for a 45 mm long clam.
Alternatively, by matching growth increments as shown on the upper part
of Figure IB (i.e., a wider annual growth increment), then it is possible to
translate or match that interval to all major growth interruption rings on the
valve. Counting the number of these increments, the approximate result obtained is that this clam would represent a 4 1/2 year old individual. This
estimate is consistent with the age/length estimate from Table 1. Having
arrived at this determination of ring pattern, identification of the sequence of
annual growth interruption episodes during the cold weather season may be
assumed.
In the example (Fig. 1B), the last period of growth on the shell is an incomplete annual increment. The sliding calipers are set at the width of the most
recent complete annual growth increments. While maintaining this setting,
the calipers are then set over the latest partial increment of growth. By inspection, the full increment width is subdivided into three equal units which, for
convenience, are labeled Early, Middle, and Late.
The seasonal classification of the shell is based on which of the three equal
subdivisions is aligned with the final growing edge of the clam. In the example
(Fig. 1B), this specimen would be classed as a clam in the Middle period of the
annual growth cycle. Had the growing edge been longer and extended into
the last third, it would be classed as Late; if it extended into the period of
growth interruption, as marked by the beginning of a groove and an inward
turning of the growing edge, it would be classed as Interrupted.
Those complete valves for which a growth stage is not confidently determinable, or whose growth morphology is indistinct for some reason, should
be placed in a fifth classification category labeled Indeterminate. This category
has important analytical value and should not be used without making a
careful effort to classify each valve into one of the four growth classes.
In the Rangia cuneata method, classification of the latest growth increment
before death is made by inspection. Evidence is lacking that more precise
measurement of this last increment (Coutts and Higham, 1971) would yield a

186

Texas Archeological Society

superior determination of seasonality for this species. The range of error in
selecting appropriate landmarks on the valve from which to measure ordinarily exceeds the metric accuracy necessary to make growth stage estimates on
a more precise basis. This problem has been approached on R. cuneata by
using a visual evaluation of growth increments in terms of the four ordinal
growth categories (Early, Middle, Late, and Interrupted) on a large sample of
valves.
Rangia cuneata samples occasionally are encountered in which the
seasonal changes of the clam habitat evidently were not as intense as usual.
As a result, it may be difficult to discern where interruptions in shell growth
took place and which of these interruptions occurred during the annual cold
season. The best procedure is to spread out all of the valves to be classified
and inspect them for growth event regularities and irregularities affecting the
sample as a whole. Ordinarily, there will be some shells in the sample which
display prominent annual rings. Working from these specimens, an overall
impression is gained of the growth characteristics of that particular population. From this initial inspection of the whole sample, it generally is possible to
go on to evaluate growth on the individual shells.
Different archeological samples often represent breeding populations
which experienced a variety of habitat conditions. The resulting phenotypic
variation in shells must be recognized in order to evaluate growth stages successfully. The appearance of growth increments can be expected to change
with each new sample. Initially, these may appear hopelessly confused and
variable. However, there usually is a pronounced central tendency for the
length of shells in a given population for each age grade. Once this tendency is
identified with the aid of age/size models (Table 1) and an approximation has
been made of the increment of shell growth during the annual growth period
for a given age grade, growth stage evaluation can proceed.

EVALUATING THE CLASSIFICATION
The classification of growth stages has proved to be sensitive to population
growth changes over very short periods of time. Usually, this sensitivity has
meant intervals of about two weeks, although there is some variation, particularly during the cold season. Once frequency data for the sample have been
compiled into growth stages, the next step is to relate these to the annual
growth cycle. This relationship is expressed by arranging the data in a relative
frequency histogram (Fig. 2) and comparing it against a master sequence.
The master sequence (Fig. 3) is based on growth stage classification of 30
modern Rangia cuneata samples collected semimonthly from several Iocations on the upper Texas coast for most periods of the year (Table 3). Often,
more than one sample was taken in different years or from different upper
coast locations from some of these semimonthly periods. The multiple samples have been averaged together to provide histogram patterns (Fig. 3)
which represent the upper Texas coast as a whole. Because the growing edge
of the living clam is a very thin, delicate margin, it is almost always broken off
of archeological specimens by the periostracum as it dries and flakes off the

shell. In order to compensate for this condition, the growing edge was
scraped off all modern samples.
The frequency histogram of an archeological sample (excluding the Indeterminate category) is compared to this master sequence of growth stages to
identify which of the semimonthly increments provides the closest match in
terms of histogram shape. It is this identity that is taken to be the seasonality
estimate of the archeological sample. The principal feature of the histograms
is not the absolute value of growth stages represented in a sample or the
position of the modal class. Evaluation of a histogram must include the pattern formed by the secondary growth categories as well. It is the overall pattern of relationships between growth categories that is matched against the
master sequence.

The Indeterminate category is used as a control on the evaluation method.
In modern samples of Rangia cuneata used to prepare the master sequence,
the Indeterminate category fluctuates around a mean of nearly 13%, with a
standard deviation of about 4% (Fig. 4). This fluctuation means that when an
archeological sample’s Indeterminate category exceeds a range of from 5 to
21% (two standard deviations from the mean), the origin of this excessive
deviation should be determined.
If it can be shown through cross checking the classification with different
evaluators that these criteria have been applied uniformly and produced replicable results (Fig. 2), then the shells should be checked to see which morphological features caused the rate of indeterminancy to be increased or decreased beyond expectations for normal populations. In some cases, the
reason can be attributed readily to poor shell preservation such as erosion of
morphologic detail through leaching or weathering processes. Or, it may be
traceable to perturbations in the habitat of the living clam. Under some circumstances, these observations can be developed into paleoclimatic data and
inferences (Aten, 1972:5).
As an example of interpretation, a sample from site 41HR85 (Aten et al.,
1976), has the following key attributes (Fig. 2): 1) indeterminate category is
within the normal range; 2) overall pattern is unimodal in the Middle stage;
and 3) secondary abundances are Early greater than Late greater than Interrupted (E> L~ Int).
This sample may be viewed as an instantaneous slice of a clam population’s
annual growth dynamics. Nearly all of the population has passed out of the
period of growth interruption; most have passed beyond the period of initial
or Early growth. The majority of individuals are in the Middle of their active
growth period, and some members have entered the Late or final phases of
active growth during this growing year. Comparison of the shape of this histogram (Fig. 2) with those of the master sequence (Fig. 3) indicates that the only
histogram bearing a comparable shape is that derived from modern samples
for the end of the month of May. The slight differences in classification of the
same sample by a second worker (Fig. 2) does not alter this interpretation of
seasonality; it is replicable.
As a second example, the modern clam sample collected on August 18,
1971 (Fig. 2) was evaluated by Sorter B as if it were an archeological sample
of unknown collection season. The key attributes are: 1) indeterminates are
within the normal range; 2) histogram is unimodal (because growth is cyclic,
the Late category is succeeded by the Interrupted category at the beginning of
the histogram); 3) mode is in the Late stage; and 4) secondary abundances
are Interrupted greater than Early slightly greater than Middle (Int~E~M).
Comparison of the shape of this histogram (Fig. 2) with those of the master
sequence (Fig. 3) indicates that the only histogram bearing a comparable
shape is the one for mid August. In this case, Sorter B knew neither the date of
collection nor the results of evaluation by Sorter A. A histogram from any
other period of the year could not be confused with this particular one for mid
August. This classification was replicable in that slight differences in sorting by
the two workers would not alter the interpretation of collection season.
Because of the relatively rapid progress of the growth stage mode through
the calendar, especially when this progress is viewed as the pattern combina-

tion of four categories, it often is possible to recognize samples of varying
modes of origin. Samples representing a single episode of collection, a series
of single collection episodes during the same month but repeated over a
period of years, or a continuous collection (occupation) for not more than a
month or so will all produce clam growth stage histograms strongly unimodal
in one or, rarely, two sequential growth stage categories.
For many survey and testing purposes, distinguishing among these three
possibilities is not of great importance. If the samples were from excavations
of individual habitation areas, other field evidence might indicate which type
of occupation took place. Occasionally, however, a sample either will lack a
mode or display a weak mode in two or more adjacent growth stages. Conditions in nature will not produce such evenly distributed growth classes simultaneously in a Rangia cuneata population. The cause must be either an
error in sorting technique or a sample consisting of a composite of clams
collected over a span of time exceeding one month, but probably less than
three months.
If a bimodal histogram occurs, this reflects either error or a composite sample in which substantial seasonal separation of occupations has occurred
(probably more than three but less than six months). In evaluation of more
than 300 Rangia samples using this seasonality method, bimodal frequencies
did not occur. Because such composite distributions must be a very rare
occurrence, a significant effort should be made to determine whether error in
technique is the cause before proposing cultural explanations.
If a large number of seasonality estimates exist from a single cultural unit,
these can be easily summarized on a statistical basis by assigning a coded
value to each semimonthly seasonality increment (Fig. 5). In the example
(Fig. 5), the mean of 18 seasonality estimates is 4.8, which correlates approximately with a mid to end May season. The standard deviation is 0.7, or
approximately 3/4 of a month. The first standard deviation range is 4.1 to
5.5, translatable to a collection period extending from the beginning of May
through mid June.
Review of figures 3 and 4 verifies the discrete character of most of the
semimonthly histograms. The ability to evaluate modern samples of known
date correctly when they are treated as unknowns (Fig. 2) provides added
confidence. The most difficult application of the master sequence occurs with
samples from the September to November period and February. However,
archeological samples attributable to these periods are rare on the Texas
coast.
This approach actually correlates the archeological Rangia cuneata growth
patterns with a set of modern environmental conditions yielding similar
growth patterns. However, the relation of the calendar to environmental conditions may have shifted somewhat, especially over the short term. In this
sense, the archeological seasonality estimates are floating. However, because
there is little between year variation in the correlation of growth stage histograms from modern samples with their collection dates (Table 3), the recent
accuracy of this method is within + I month and likely may not be more than
+ 1/2 month.

SAMPLE SELECTION
Individual members of any given Rangia cuneata population vary slightly in
their growth rate (Fig. 3; Table 3). Thus, for any given time of year, the
population growth pattern will be unique. This unique growth pattern is revealed through classification of a large sample of individual shells. Samples of
100 valves were used initially, but samples of 50 valves did not entail loss of
information in the clarity of growth stage histograms. If shell morphology is
well developed and well preserved, samples of less than 50 valves may be
evaluated if necessary; however, fewer than 20 valves should be used only
with the utmost caution.

194

Texas Archeological Society

The most suitable Rangia cuneata shells to use for seasonality classification
are those in the third and fourth year age groups. Shellfish younger than 2
years have not completed an annual increment of shell growth as an adult;
therefore, the latest growth stage cannot be compared with its pattern of adult
growth. In exceptional cases (e.g., when third year clams are not available),
second year clams could be used to make a generalized estimate of growth
stage, such as assignment to early or late in the growth cycle. This assignment
would permit at least a crude estimate of the season of collection.
On shells 5 or more years old, annual rings become progressively more
difficult to distinguish. Feeding and respiratory efficiency of bivalve molluscs
decreases as they grow larger so that their growth is a self limiting process
(Stanley, 1970:54). Although the between year variation in width of new
growth is not great in Rangia cuneata (Table 2), methodological noise in the
histograms is minimized by concentrating on samples from a single, or
perhaps two sequential, age classes.
In selecting a sample, the principal criterion to observe is that all specimens
should be as capable of interpretation as when originally taken from their
habitat. Specimens should be selected carefully for: 1) age/size (preferably
third or fourth year clams); 2) completeness (must have an umbo to growing
edge section); and 3) preservation (shells must not be heavily eroded or
leached).
The sorting class of Indeterminate does not refer to fragmentary, eroded,
or otherwise degraded shells. The Indeterminate class is needed for whole,
well preserved shells of optimum size which nevertheless grew an indistinct or
equivocal morphology precluding assignment to a growth category. While
Indeterminates are not a growth stage, they are a function of growth processes in the clam population and serve as a methodological check.
Another important sampling factor is the selection of either right or left
valves for growth stage evaluation. This selection has not been observed
uniformly in the archeological samples because of the extreme bilateral symmetry in this species. There is only a remote possibility of duplicating right and
left valves from the same clam often enough to make any impact on the
growth pattern of a sample of 50 or so valves. Discretion should be used; if a
small shell lens consisting only of a few hundred valves were sampled, it-might
be more appropriate for only right or left valves to be selected. If the sample
represents tens of thousands of valves, then same valve selection would not
matter.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MAJOR GROWTH INTERRUPTIONS
Initially, the annual growth interruption rings were assumed to be associated exclusively with the winter season, but this is not exactly so. Close
examination of the modern clam growth stage histograms (Fig. 3) reveals a
regular progression of the modal growth category through the year.
Dynamics of growth variation become much more clear when the Figure 3
data are replotted in a time series by individual growth stage classes (Fig. 4).
At the top of Figure 4, Interrupted growth stages through the year are
plotted along one time axis; below this, the Early growth category is plotted,

Aten - Rangia cuneata

etc. By connecting the modal peaks of these sequential growth stages with a
straight line, the progression of each year’s growth through a population is
graphically demonstrated. By selecting any point along the horizontal time
axis and then looking vertical to that axis through the growth stages, the
growth variation around the mode is seen. By this means, the duration and
magnitude of Interrupted growth is seen to be always present to some degree.
Interruption is a major constituent of variation from roughly August to April
and reaches its maximum intensity from December to February. This situation
suggests a causal relationship with habitat temperature.
Rangia cuneata ciliary activity is reduced substantially below 16 °C (6 I°F)
and above 28°C (82°F) (Hopkins et al., 1973:154). Because the cilia are
essential to feeding and ventilation, their response to temperature variation
must be related significantly to shell growth. To test this, there should be a
strong negative correlation between the percentage of clams in the Interrupted growth stage and temperature (Table 4). The correlation coefficient
for this relationship was R = - .84 (significant at the .01 level) which supports the hypothesis.
Other environmental factors, however, might influence the proportion of
shells in the Interrupted stage. For example, rainfall may affect salinity, and
stream discharge may affect salinity as well as flush quantities of algae, detritus, or phytoplankton into the lower streams and estuaries. Salinity alone,
however, was not found to be a controlling factor in ciliary activity (Hopkins et
al., 1973:25-27).
Correlation coefficients relating rainfall and stream discharge to the combined proportions of Early, Middle, and Late clam growth stages should be of
a much lower order than for temperature. In testing this relationship, data
were used both for a large river (the Trinity) and for a small river draining only
the coastal plain (the Lavaca). None of the correlation coefficients was statistically significant, thus supporting the hypothesis (Table 4). Because the
growth response to salinity might not be immediate, correlation coefficients
also were calculated for stream discharge against the total percentage of
Early, Middle, and Late stage clams of the succeeding month. Results were
not statistically significant (Table 4).
Data on reduced ciliary activity at temperatures above 28 °C (82 OF) probably point directly at the cause of the principal secondary, or summer, growth
interruption feature. Average air temperatures of 82°F are exceeded in July
and August (Table 4) and water temperatures are only slightly cooler. There is
a pronounced positive bulge in the Interrupted growth curve for the AugustSeptember period (Fig. 4) reflecting the small but noticeable impact of high
temperature growth interruption.
The conclusion is that the major annual Interrupted growth stage is of long
duration and most closely associated with seasonal variations in temperature.
It is not correlated with fluctuations of rainfall, stream discharge, and salinity.
Presumably, any other natural phenomena which might cause a growth interruption would introduce very low orders of predictable interruptions. These
mechanisms primarily contribute to background noise; some amount of
growth interruption may be found on virtually all modern seasonality estimates throughout the year.

CONCLUSIONS
One of the principal foundations for describing and testing archeological
models is the determination of temporal and spatial control of archeological
data. Because of this need, reconstruction of annual patterns and schedules
of settlement must be made. On the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico,
from the coastal bend of Texas to the Florida panhandle, the majority of shell
middens are composed either partially or entirely of the brackish water clam
Rangia cuneata. A practical method now exists for determining the season of
collection of R. cuneata clams with an accuracy of at least + 1 month.
Use of this method opens opportunities for analysis of scheduling at both an
intersite regional and intrasite local scale. For example, current analysis
(Aten, unpublished data) indicates that nearly all coastal shell middens in the
upper Texas coast were occupied during the early summer. Seasonality samples have been analyzed from single occupation episode sites which seem to
allow discrimination of habitation periods as short as 2 weeks duration from
others occupied for periods up to 6 weeks duration (Aten, unpublished data).
Other applications are plausible. Archeological Rangia cuneata shells theoretically contain the most detailed season by season record in existence of
water temperatures for the last 3500 years on the coast. The morphological
seasonality technique used in conjunction with oxygen isotope and C14 determinations could be the basis for a practical regional research program into
high resolution reconstruction of paleotemperatures.
Finally, a second Rangia species, R. flexuosa, is found occasionally in the
region’s archeological sites (Aten et al., 1976:9; Fig. 4). Rangia flexuosa is
distinguished from R. cuneata only by its slightly indented pallial sinuses and
short hinge teeth which do not extend to the adductor muscle scars (Fig. 1A).
Rangiaflexuosa occupies somewhat higher salinity estuarine habitats than are
normally used by R. cuneata; is uniformly smaller in size; and does not display
the prominent growth ring morphology seen on R. cuneata. Consequently,
this seasonality procedure probably cannot be extended to R. flexuosa.

ABSTRACT
A survey of lithic tool resources of the eastern Llano Estacado was aimed at characterizing the
types and availability of material suitable for tool making found in the various geologic units that
make up the bedrock of the area. Five major units are present along the eastern Llano Estacado:
Quartermaster Formation; Dockum Group; Antlers Sand; Edwards Limestone; and Ogallala
Formation. The Quartermaster Formation (uppermost Permian) contains the Alibates Dolomite
Lentil, providing the well known, multicolored Alibates agate found along the Canadian River
Valley. The Dockum Group (upper Triassic) has a basal gravel with quartzite and cherts, common throughout the survey area. Along the east central Llano Estacado, the Dockum contains
the Tecovas Formation which often yields lenses of jasper (Tecovas or Quitaque jasper) and
chert. The Antlers Sand (lower Cretaceous) found on the southeastern Llano Estacado has a
basal gravel with quartzites, cherts, and jasper. The Edwards Limestone, occurring in the same
areas as the Antlers, sometimes contains nodules and lenses of chert. The Ogallala Formation
(Miocene-Pliocene) has the most variety and abundance of suitable and available raw material for
artifacts. Gravels are found throughout the area, including quartzites, cherts, flint, and jasper.
Pedogenic caliches formed in the upper Ogallala, Edwards, and Blanco Formation (Pliocene) are
often silicified and occasionally opalized, providing marginal to good quality material. The presence of such quantities of varied, readily available material imposes severe limitations on the use
of particular rock types as indicators of trade with other areas.

INTRODUCTION
The types, quantities, and availability of rocks suitable for manufacturing
lithic tools in a given area should have considerable influence on the quantity
and quality of lithic tools and debitage found in archeological sites. The physical properties of a particular rock type will, in large measure, control the
workability of a tool and its wear resistance. The availability and amount of
usable material would be expected to control the degree of reutilization and
conservation of tools and debitage. As Ahler (1977:133) stated, a geological
survey aimed at linking".., stone types to an area of natural occurence...
is an essential step in any meaningful investigations of lithic or any other raw
material selection and procurement system."
The importance of proximity and quality of geological outcrops to archeological investigations is not new to archeology (Bryan, 1950; Coffin,
1951). However, such systematic surveys of lithic resource areas are rela-

202

tively rare in archeology. Surveys and petrographic studies of specific, well
known rock types or outcrops are more common (Clayton et al, 1970; Hood,
1978; Schaeffer, 1958).
The Llano Estacado (Southern High Plains of Texas and eastern New Mexico) has been the scene of archeological investigations for over half a century
(Collins, 1971; Kelly, 1964; Holliday, in press). The importance of raw material availability and types to the quality and quantity of tools and debitage in
archeological sites has been recognized (Green and Kelly, 1960; Hester,
1975; Hood, 1978; Hughes, 1976). The area contains outcrops and quarries
of Alibate agate, one of the best known raw materials on the Plains. Considerable attention has been given the material (Asquith, 1975; Bowers and
Reaser, 1974; Bryan, 1950; Green and Kelly, 1960; Schaeffer, 1958).
Hester (1972, 1975) reviews some of the more common rock types available in the area and mentions several specific locations. Several reviews of rock
types common in specific areas and some associated outcrops are available
(Etchieson et al., 1977, 1978; Hughes and Hood, 1976; Harrison and Killen,
1978). Hughes (1978) and Willey and Hughes (1978) review the bedrock
stratigraphy in the MacKenzie Reservoir area. Hughes (1976) provides a review of references to lithic resources in the Texas Panhandle.
Despite previous work, a regional, systematic research concerning the
characteristics of lithic material as they relate to bedrock types is lacking. Such
a survey is particularly important on the Llano Estacado because the surface is
mantled by a thick cover of Pleistocene eolian sediments. Hence, rock outcrops are common only along the escarpments that form the west, north, and
east boundaries of the Llano Estacado. Limited outcrops also occur along the
deeper drainages (draws) and lake basins (playas). To procure material, inhabitants of the interior of the area would have to travel some distance to the
outcrops or trade. Additionally, by determining the nature of available local
material, identification of rock types from other areas is feasible.

METHODOLOGY
A preliminary survey of available lithic tool resources on the eastern Llano
Estacado was conducted. The principal goal was to characterize, macroscopically, the types of materials available in each of the major bedrock units in the
region. Petrographic analysis was not undertaken nor an intensive study of
the knapping characteristics of individual rock types. Field investigations centered on the Lubbock area and included the eastern escarpment of the Llano
Estacado extending from the eastern end of Palo Duro Canyon (Briscoe
County) south and west to Fluvanna (Scurry County) and Lamesa (Dawson
County) and extending east from the escarpment a short distance onto the
Rolling Plains (Fig. 1).
Roadcuts and quarries were examined along the escarpment, reentrant
canyons, draws, and larger playa lake basins. An effort was not made to
locate archeological quarry sites. A survey of geological and archeological
literature dealing with rock types and stratigraphy and specific outcrop areas
and quarries also was conducted.

Exposures of suitable raw materials were recorded and sampled even if
they occurred as gravel too small to be utilized for tool manufacture. Although
specific localities may not have provided rocks of sufficient size for flaking, it
was considered that the material would be an indication of what could be
available in other exposures of the same formation. Identification of rock
types was based on macroscopic properties such as color, texture, and
mineralogical composition.

ROCK AND MINERAL NOMENCLATURE
When describing rocks and minerals used for manufacturing artifacts, it is
advisable to follow classification schemes established by geologists. Confusion exists among archeologists concerning certain rock types (e.g., flint vs.

204

Texas Archeological Society

chert); and in many cases, terms have been improperly used by geologists,
primarily because a general agreement on terminology is lacking. The following summary of various rock and mineral types commonly used for artifacts,
particularly on the Southern High Plains, follows those of Blatt et al. (1980)
and Lapedes (1978). Definitions can vary depending on the source consulted.
Most lithic tools are made from various forms of fine crystalline quartz
(silica). This quartz generally occurs as either fiberous varieties, termed
chalcedony (a mineral), or microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline forms termed
chert (a rock). Differentiating chalcedony from chert (which can have chalcedony in it) is very difficult in hand specimens. Color is the best key for a
general classification of forms of chert. The best known variety of chalcedony
is agate, which has multicolored bands. Cherts are most commonly various
shades of gray to tan. Very dark gray or black cherts usually are referred to as
flint. Cherts strongly colored with red, brown, or yellow are termed jasper.
Other common rock types for tools are quartzite and silicified and opalized
caliche. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock, usually a metamorphosed sandstone (i.e., subjected to high temperature and pressure). Quartz sandstone
cemented with silica is often mistermed quartzite. Individual grains of quartz
usually are not apparent in metamorphic quartzite (metaquartz). In silica cemented quartz sandstone (often called orthoquartz), individual, rounded
quartz grains generally are visible, particularly with the aid of a hand lens.
Ebright (1979) presents a summary of quartzite genesis and terminology
oriented toward the archeologist and lithic technician.
Caliche, also referred to as calcrete, is a frequently misused term. Caliche is
a massive, Well indurated form of calcium carbonate, precipitated during very
long periods of soil formation in semiarid to arid regions. Under proper conditions, calcium carbonate can be replaced by silica resulting in the formation of
silicified caliche. Generally, obvious visual differences are lacking between
caliche and silicified forms but the latter tends towards greenish hues. It also
breaks in concoidal fractures.
The silicification process also can result in the formation of opalized caliche.
Opal is a hydrated form of silica, usually a lustrous white and sometimes
exhibiting various spectral colors. The opal often is found in the caliche as
irregularly shaped nodules.
Much of the raw material used for tool making comes from gravels in unconsolidated sediments or conglomerates in consolidated deposits. Size classification of the clasts is of considerable importance in assessing suitability for
flaking into an artifact. They are as follows: boulders -- 256 mm (10 in) + ;
cobbles -- 64-256 mm (21/2-10 in); pebbles -- 4-64 mm (3/16-21/2 in).

BEDROCK STRATIGRAPHY
The stratigraphy and structure of the Southern High Plains is well known
from diverse studies (Meade et al, 1974; Evans, 1949; Evans and Brand,
1956; Nicholson, 1960; Sellards et al., 1947). Geologic maps of the area
include 1:250,000 scale maps of the Amarillo (Barnes, 1969), Plainview

Holliday and Welty - Lithic Tool Resources

205

(Barnes, 1968), Lubbock (Barnes, 1967) and Big Spring (Barnes, 1974)
areas.

Five major (sedimentary rock) units contain material suitable for lithic tool
manufacture. From older to younger, these are: Quartermaster Formation~
Dockum Group; Antlers Sand; Edwards Limestone; and Ogallala Formation. Various pedogenic caliches occasionally yield material of varying quality.
The Quartermaster Formation (uppermost Permian) and older Permian
redbeds crop out at the surface of the Rolling Plains east of the Llano Estacado
(Fig. 1). The Quartermaster is the oldest unit near the Llano Estacado containing suitable material for lithic tools. The redbeds consist of silty, evenly
bedded, locally massive shales; sandy, well indurated siltstone; and silty, fine
grained sandstone. Gypsum and dolomite beds occur discontinuously.
The Alibates Dolomite Lentil, in the upper Quartermaster has been
mapped along the northern Llano Estacado, primarily in the Canadian River
drainage. The unit, parts of which have been altered to agate, is found near
the top of the Quartermaster Formation (Gould, 1907; Barnes, 1969; Patton, 1923), although on some correlation charts it is shown as a separate unit,
underlying the Quartermaster (Nicholson, 1960:Fig. 45). The Quartermaster
Formation crops out continuously near the foot of the Llano Estacado escarpment from Donley to Kent counties (Fig. 1).
The Dockum Group (upper Triassic) forms the lower portion of the Llano
Estacado escarpment. Because the unit was deposited in a large northwest
southeast trending basin (McGowan et al., 1979), outcrops occur only along
the northwestern, eastern, and southeastern Llano Estacado with beds generally becoming thicker from north to south (Figs. 1,2). Along the northern
and northeastern Llano Estacado, the Dockum often is subdivided into the
Tecovas and Trujillo Formations.
The Tecovas Formation, the oldest unit, is composed of a basal conglomerate with discontinuous chert lenses and overlying varicolored shales. The
Trujillo Formation consists of red, interbedded sandy conglomerates, conglomeratic sandstones, and shales. To the south, the Dockum consists of a
complex sequence of conglomerates, fine to coarse grained, red, indurated
sandstones, reddish brown sandy clays, and varicolored sandy shales. Discontinuous chert lenses occur throughout the Unit (Barnes, 1969; McGowan
et al., 1979).
The Antlers Sand and Edwards Limestone are lower Cretaceous deposits
found along the east central and southeast Llano Estacado. The Antlers,
which is the basal Cretaceous unit in the area, consists of varicolored siltstone,
sand, sandstone, and a basal conglomerate. The Edwards Limestone is separated from the Antlers by the Walnut Formation and Comanche Peak Limestone. The Edwards consists of fine to medium grained limestone with occasional chert lenses (Brand, 1953; Barnes, 1974; Meade et al., 1974).
The Ogallala Formation (Miocene-Pliocene) is the most ubiquitous rock
unit of the High Plains, cropping out continuously along the northern and
eastern Llano Estacado. The unit consists of a basal red to brown sand and
conglomerate (Couch Formation of Evans, 1949); and an upper, reddish,
unconsolidated sand, silt, and clay with occasional gravel lenses (Bridwell
Formation of Evans, 1949) (Reeves, 1972). Along the northern Llano Esta-

cado, Patton (1923) identified a basal gravel, termed the Potter Formation or
Potter gravel (Hood, 1978), lithologically different from the basal gravel common in the Ogallala to the south.
A very well developed, well indurated caliche formed at the top of the
bedrock, the ledge forming caprock caliche. Generally, the unit developed by
soil forming processes in the upper Ogallala. On the southern Llano Estacado, where the Ogallala thins and the Edwards Limestone forms the surface
outcrop, caliche formed in the latter.

Holliday and Welty -- Lithic Tool Resources

207

On the south central Llano Estacado, along the escarpment and in draws,
outcrops of the Blanco Formation (upper Pliocene) consist of discontinuous
deposits of dolomite set into the top of the Ogallala. A well developed caliche
often is found at the top of the Blanco. The Ogallala and Blanco caliches are
often silicified and occasionally opalized.
The surface of the Llano Estacado is mantled by a thick deposit of Pleistocene eolian sediments referred to as the cover sands (Frye and Leonard,
1965) or Blackwater Draw Formation (Reeves, 1976). The Ogallala appears
present virtually everywhere beneath the Pleistocene deposits (Oetking,
1959).

BEDROCK MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR
TOOL MANUFACTURE
Alibates agate is the only material in the Quartermaster Formation suitable
for manufacturing tools. This multicolored material, occurring as lenses and
nodules, is the result of silicification of the dolomite (Gould, 1907; Asquith,
1975; Bowers and Reaser, 1974). The best known outcrops are in Alibates
National Monument near Fritch (Fig. 1). Other outcrops are found on both
sides of the Canadian River northeast of Amarillo and sometimes in local
gravels (Etchieson et al., 1978; Gould, 1907; Hughes, 1976; Patton, 1923).
The colors in the agate occur mainly in bands, but also as mottles (Patton,
1923). Most colors are maroon to reds to tans with milky white interbands.
Other colors observed include chocolate brown, blue, and yellow.
Several different kinds of materials are available from the Dockum Group.
Most common are the pebble and cobble conglomerates, particularly notable
in the lower Dockum. In outcrops west of Flomot (Fig. 1), dominant lithologies are coarse to medium grained, light colored quartzites and red jaspers.
Other materials included flint and light glassy, fine grained, tan and light to
medium gray cherts. Similar lithologies are reported from a variety of areas
(McGowan et al., 1979) and outcrops appear to be quite common throughout the survey area. Outcrops with cobbles were not observed. Some probably are available and presumably lithologies would be similar.
Artifacts made from a jasper from the Tecovas Formation of the lower
Dockum Group are common in many archeological sites in the area. The
material is known locally known as Tecovas or Quitaque jasper (after the best
known outcrop near the town of Quitaque) (Fig. 1). Other reported outcrops
are in Palo Duro Canyon (Etchieson et al., 1978; McGowan et al., 1979) and
along the Canadian River Valley northwest of Amarillo (Jack T. Hughes,
personal communication). The material usually occurs as lenses. Colors
usually are maroon with mottles of yellow and brown common.
Tecovas jasper has been confused with Alibates agate, particularly if the
specimens are small such as flakes (Hughes, 1976; Green and Kelley, 1960;
Katz and Katz, 1976). Banding has been used as an indicator of Alibates
agate. However, Alibates also can be mottled. Alibates agate often has faint
suggestions of other colors within the red, whereas Tecovas jasper usually has
an even red color. Tecovas jasper tends to have more tiny quartz vugs than
Alibates agate.
Recent studies of the Lubbock lithic assemblage indicate that Alibates agate
and Tecovas jasper can be distinguished with relative confidence using low

208

Texas Archeological Society

magnifications (10-20x) (Doug Bamforth, personal communication). Ali~
bates agate tends to have a more vitreous, waxy luster and frequently, it is
possible to see a short distance into the stone. Tecovas jasper, on the other
hand, is opaque and bluish white quartz vugs are apparent.
A quartzite that is coarser grained than the jasper but otherwise has a similar
appearance (Tecovas quartzite) also is found in the Tecovas Formation (Etchieson et al., 1978).
Outcrops of the Antlers Sand are found in Borden, Dawson, and Garza
counties, south of Post and west of Fluvanna and Gail (Barnes, 1974) and in
Shafter Lake, Andrews County (Meade et al., 1974) (Fig. 1). The unit often
contains a basal gravel with lithologies similar to the Dockum gravel, including
some light colored quartzites, jasper, flint, and petrified wood. Observed outcrops of Antlers yielded only pebble clasts. It is not known if cobbles are
available.
Outcrops of material adequate for tool making were not found in the
Walnut Formation nor Comanche Peak Limestone. However, Evans and
Brand (1956:10) mention "a prominent quartzose conglomerate in the basal
3 feet of the [Commanche Peak Limestone]" in southeast Lubbock County.
Tan to gray cherts quite similar to cherts commonly found in the Edwards
Limestone in Central Texas are ubiquitous in archeological sites on the Llano
Estacado (Hester, 1972; Johnson and Holliday, 1981). In the survey area,
outcrops of light gray to tan cherts were found in the Edwards Limestone
along the southeast escarpment of the Llano Estacado in Borden and Garza
counties. The chert was not present everywhere in the Edwards outcrops.
This particular material probably does not account for the high percentages
of similar chert in local archeological sites. Hester (1972, 1975) reports outcrops of chert in the Edwards Limestone in the Sterling City - San Angelo
area, 50~90 mi southeast of Big Spring. Harrison and Killen (1978) mention
an outcrop in Jones County, northeast of San Angelo.
In the survey area, gravel of the Ogallala Formation produces the most
abundant and varied material for making lithic tools. The material is common
throughout the area. Within the Ogallala, the basal gravel generally seems to
have the largest clasts and highest quality materials. Light colored, medium to
coarse grained quartzites are most common. Several experimental tools were
made of this material by the authors, with most satisfactory results.
Dark gray to black, medium grained quartzites also were found; and red to
brown jaspers, medium to dark gray and dark blue chert, and flint were common. Outcrops of the upper Ogallala yielded a generally finer grained (pebble
sized) gravel and contained light colored, coarse grained quartzite, purple
quartzite, flint, some medium gray chert, and brown to yellow jasper. Along
the northeastern Llano Estacado, cherts apparently are rare in Ogallala
gravels, quartzites being the dominant lithology (Jack T. Hughes, personal
communication).
Potter chert is found in gravel of the Potter Formation of the lower Ogallala
on the northern Llano Estacado (Hood, 1978). The material is a dense, gray
to brown, silica cemented, very fine grained siltstone; it possibly is derived
from the Morrison Formation (Jurrasic) in New Mexico. Other materials
found in the Potter gravels are purple quartzite, some jasper, chert, petrified

Holliday and Welty -- Lithic Tool Resources

209

(silicified) wood, and various quartzites referred to as Potter quartzite (Hood,
1978~ Etchieson et al., 1977).
The various well developed caliches in the area provide occasionally
marginal to high quality raw materials for lithic tool manufacture. The caprock
caliche in the upper Ogallala Formation and Edwards Limestone and the
caliche formed in the upper Blanco Formation are silicified in places. Such
silicified caliche, although of poor quality, can be used for lithic tools. Despite
its poor workability the material is common in some archeological sites (Johnson and Holliday, 1981), particularly where outcrops are nearby.
In some areas, the silicification process has gone so far as to produce an
opalized caliche, usually in the lower caprock caliche (Reeves, 1970). The
opal is of fairly good quality and flakes of the material are common in archeological sites in the area (Hughes, 1976~ Hughes and Willey, 1978). Opal
outcrops were observed in exposures of the caprock at the Muleshoe Wildlife
Refuge (MWR) and reported from Cedar Lake (C.C. Reeves Jr., personal
communication) and in the MacKenzie Reservoir area (Hughes, 1978). (Fig.

1).
Outcrops of other materials sometimes found in sites on or near the Llano
Estacado are outside of the survey area. The Seymour Formation (Pleistocene) occurs in a north south trending outcrop 80 to 100 mi east of the Llano
Estacado. The deposit consists of gravels apparently derived from the Potter
gravels of the Ogallala Formation and the siliceous conglomerates from the.
Dockum Group (Hood, 1978). Presumably, Ogallala gravels with lithologies
similar to those found south of the Potter outcrops would be found in the
Seymour gravels.
Durler (1976) discusses a conglomerate with quartzites and other siliceous
material suitable for tool manufacture that makes up early or pre-Pleistocene
terraces of the Pecos River near Carlsbad (New Mexico), southwest of the
Llano Estacado.
Quartzite considered to be from outcrops of the Dakota Formation (upper
Cretaceous) near Ft. Sumner and Tucumcari (New Mexico), along the northwest escarpment, is a common artifact material on the northern Llano Estacado (Hester, 1975; Willey and Hughes, 1978). Although the material has
been described as "metamorphosed sandstone" (Willey and Hughes,
1978:47), this description is misleading as it is not a metamorphic rock. The
material is a silica cemented sandstone more properly termed Dakota orthoquartzite (Hughes and Hood, 1976). The material is coarse grained and
varies from reds to browns, causing some problem in differentiating it from
Tecovas quartzite.
Obsidian occasionally is found in archeological sites in the area. The
nearest source of this material is believed to be central New Mexico.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A variety of materials suitable for manufacturing lithic artifacts is available
along the eastern escarpment of the Llano Estacado. Most of the material is
available in the form of gravel and includes flint, chert, jasper, and various

210

Texas Archeological Society

quartzites. Material found in situ in various deposits includes high quality
agate and jasper, chert, and some opal. The Ogallala Formation has the
greatest variety and abundance of material in the area.
Due to the amount of raw material available in gravels in the region, caution
should be exercised in naming rock types. Such distinctive in situ materials as
Alibates agate and Tecovas jasper are properly named. However, materials
found in gravels should only be described by rock type and not formally
named. The geological convention for naming a formation using its lithology
(e.g., Edwards Limestone, Antlers Sand) is employed only when the unit is
predominately of one lithology. When a variety of rock types is present, the
term Formation is used in place of the lithology (e.g., Ogallala Formation). By
analogy, the use of such terms as Potter chert or Ogallala chert (Hughes,
1976) implies that the material formed in the deposit. Ogallala chert or opal
may be properly applied to the silicified or opalized caliche in the Ogallala
(Hughes, 1976).
The availability of such a variety of material places considerable limitations
on the use of rock types found in archeological sites for estimating possible
trade routes. A notable example are the gravels of high quality chert and flint
in the Ogallala. The material is macroscopically identical to chert found in the
Edwards Limestone in Central Texas and may have been derived from previously existing Cretaceous outcrops in the area during deposition of the
Ogallala.
The availability and quality of chert from the Ogallala along the eastern and
southeastern Llano Estacado escarpment probably accounts for the large
number of tools made from it in archeological sites in the area rather than
trade networks between this area and Central Texas. Such trade routes may
have existed but lithic artifact materials should not be used as evidence.

ABSTRACT
Although it is a Southwestern affiliated area, western Texas largely has been ignored by
regional archeologists. The area’s ceramic chronology was sketched out some 30 years ago and
not substantially modified until 1976. A combination and synthesis is presented of results of
several recent ceramic studies in and around the Hueco Bolson, immediately east of El Paso
(Texas). These analyses consisted of morphological studies of local wares in order to discover
stylistic trends which were potentially significant as chronological markers; and application of a
series of radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates in order to
place the sequence in time. Results of these efforts are a new, and early, origin date for local West
Texas ceramics ai~d a substantially refined developmental sequence for these wares.

INTRODUCTION
Archeologists have long recognized the Southwestern affinites of the prehistoric cultures of western Texas (Stallings, 1932). This tradition includes
sedentary villages of pithouses and later multiroomed pueblos, corn-beansquash agriculture, and extensive use of ceramics. Nevertheless, western
Texas traditionally has attracted little of the attention of Southwestern archeologists. This situation undoubtedly is due to the area’s position on the
periphery of the Greater Southwest.
The ceramic chronology of western Texas was established in very broad
terms between 1930 and 1948 (Stallings, 1930, 1931; Lehmer, 1948). The
chronology largely was created by application of chronological schemes from
better known areas of the Southwest. Dated ceramics from the nearby Casas
Grandes, Mimbres, and Gila areas were employed extensively. These intricately decorated, highly visible, intrusive ceramics characteristically occur in
small quantities in western Texas and are not usually present on small sites.
Early ceramic studies gave very limited attention to the less complex local
ceramics which make up the overwhelming majority of every western Texas
sherd collection.
What little work was done with local western Texas ceramics succeeded in
establishing two basic, although very broad, categories. The later type, El
Paso Polychrome, was described by Stallings (1930, 1931). Polychrome is a
misnomer as vessels of this type are decorated with black and red only. The
predecessor of El Paso Polychrome was not recognized for some years.
Lehmer (1948) defined El Paso Brown as the local manifestation of the
Pithouse period brownware tradition which was widespread in portions of
eastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, northern Mexico, and western

Texas. Association of western Texas ceramics with tree ring dated intrusive
ceramic types allowed Lehmer (1948:87-90) to postulate a date range of ca
1050 B.P. - 850 B.P. (A.D. 900 - A.D. 1100) for El Paso Brown and ca 850
B.P. - 550 B.P. (A.D. 1100 - A.D. 1400) for El Paso Polychrome.
Two important points were left unclarified. First, Lehmer’s (1948) chronological scheme had ceramics and pithouse villages appearing in the area at
1050 B.P. (A.D. 900), ca 1,000 years after their documented appearance in
more central portions of the Southwest. The effect of this chronological
scheme was to cause western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico to appear
to be extremely peripheral with respect to Greater Southwestern development. The question, then, is whether or not such a characterization is correct.
The second point concerns the developmental progression between El Paso
Brown and El Paso Polychrome. Details of this sequence are of great utility in
subdivision of the long Pithouse and Pueblo periods into finer chronological
units in the numerous cases in which diagnostic intrusive ceramics are not
present.
The present study is directed at these problems. It combines and synthesizes results of several ceramic analyses in and around the Hueco Bolson,
immediately east of El Paso (Texas) (Whalen, 1978, in press). These analyses
consisted of morphological studies of El Paso Brown and Polychrome vessels
in order to discover stylistic trends which potentially were significant as chronological markers; and application of a series of radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates to place the stylistic
sequence in time.

CERAMIC ORIGINS
Two recent series of radiocarbon dates from western Texas (Whalen, in
press) and adjacent portions of Southcentral New Mexico (Morenon and
Hays, 1978) show that undecorated brown ceramics appeared in the first half
of the Christian era (Table 1). The first three dates are from the Hueco
Bolson, adjacent to El Paso. Other dates are from the Rio Grande Valley near
Hatch (New Mexico), ca 60 m northwest of the Hueco Bolson.
These findings have several important implications. First, a nonceramic
Archaic period did not last until 1050 B.P. (A.D. 900) in western Texas and
Southcentral New Mexico as Lehmer (1948:88) originally suggested.
Lehmer’s (1948) dated El Paso Brown does not represent the beginning of
ceramic use in the area. Instead, he was dating the last part of a long Pithouse
period. Second, western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico did not lag as
far behind developed Southwestern areas as Lehmer’s (1948) chronological
scheme implied.
The circumstances under which ceramics come into use all over the Southwest are obscure. Ceramics appear at the beginning of the Christian era, or in
its early centuries, over substantial portions of the region. Associated with
these ceramics are pithouse villages which were at least semisedentary and
semiagricultural (Morenon and Hays, 1978~ Whalen, 1980). Common use
of ceramics appears to be concomitant with a basically new way of life which

appeared at roughly the same time all over the Southwest. Radiocarbon dates
show that, far from lagging 1,000 years behind in such developments, western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico participated in a similar series of
cultural developments at a comparable time.

CERAMIC EVOLUTION
Initial steps in subdivision of western Texas brownwares were taken by
radiocarbon dating two archeological sites from which two distinctive
brownware vessel rim shapes were recovered (Table 2). Starred figures in
Table 2 are ceramic thermoluminescence dates~ others are radiocarbon
dates.
Each of these forms was the overwhelmingly dominant one at its site of
occurrence. The two sites were Pithouse period villages located in the Hueco
Bolson of western Texas (Whalen, 1977, 1978). Rim variants observed at
these two sites are termed pinched and pinched-flattened. The pinched variety (Fig. 1) is made by drawing the wet clay of the vessel rim to a small point,
most probably between the fingers of the potter. The pinched-flattened variety (Fig. 2) noticeably is flattened at the very top of the rim as if the wet clay
had been thinned and drawn into a point, but then flattened slightly.
Differences other than rim form also exist between pinched rim
brownwares (early brownwares) and pinched-flattened rims (late
brownwares). Early brownware vessels seem to be both smaller and thicker
walled than any of their successors. Mean rim diameter is 13.2 cm (standard
deviation = 4.3, n = 24). Mean vessel wall thickness for a sample of 100
body sherds is 5.6 mm (standard deviation = 1.1). In comparison, late
brownware rim diameters averaged 17.0 cm (standard deviation = 4.9, n =
20). Mean vessel wall thickness in a sample of 100 late brownware body
sherds was 5.0 mm (standard deviation = 0.9).
The significance of the difference in vessel wall mean thickness in early and
late brownware variants was tested using the t test for means in two indepen-

dent populations. The hypothesis tested was that the early brownware thickness mean (/.1) is equal to the late brownware thickness means (/.2), or Ho:
/.1 -- /’2" The alternative hypothesis is that the earlier brownware thickness
mean is significantly greater than that of the later brownware, or H 1:/’1 ~/’2"
The level of significance of the test (~) is 0.01. The form of the alternative
hypothesis requires a one-tailed t test in which the null hypothesis is rejected if
the calculated value of t is greater than a critical value (k), defined as tI _ i/2c~
for N1 + N2 - 2 degrees of freedom. The value of k is read from tables of
percentiles for the t distribution.
The t statistic is"

cal-

as:
(N1- 1)Sl2 + (N2- 1)s22
SP2 =

(N1 - 1) + (N2- 1)

In this case, df -- 198. Substituting the mean and standard deviation values
for earlier and later brownware thicknesses, t = 4.29. The critical value (k) for
198 degrees of freedom and a level of significance of 0.01 is 2.58. As t is
greater than k, Ho is rejected in favor of H1. The mean thickness of earlier El
Paso Brown is significantly greater than the mean thickness of later El Paso
Brown in this sample.
A similar t-test was performed for rim diameters. The hypothesis tested was
that the earlier and later brownware have the same mean rim diameter. The
alternative hypothesis states that the mean rim diameter for later brownware
is significantly greater than that of earlier brownware. In this case, df = 42,
t = 2.73, and k = 2.01 at the 0.5 level, leading to rejection of the null
hypothesis. Mean rim diameter increases significantly between earlier and
later Pithouse times in this sample.
Earlier vessel finish ranges from coarse and bumpy with frequent pits and
scrape marks (common), to somewhat finer finish (uncommon). Vessels are
never very finely finished. Small, hollow, red painted triangles decorate the
lip of one rim sherd in this sample. A deep horizontal groove also appears
below the lip of another specimen. It is impossible at present to quantify the
frequency of occurrence of painting and incising, but both are quite rare.
Surface finish of later El Paso Brown vessels as a group is somewhat finer
than that of their predecessors. The pit and scrape marks which appeared so
frequently on earlier brownware do not seem to characterize the later assemblage. Small red and black painted geometric motifs occasionally are
present on rim sherds. This painting appears to occur more frequently on later
than on earlier brownware, but this suggestion cannot be validated with current data.
Vessel shape is more difficult to compare in early and late brown ware
assemblages. General brownware vessel forms include ladels, hemispherical
bowls, neckless jars similar to Mexican tecomates or Southwestern seed jars,
and wide mouthed jars with a short, near vertical neck (Fig. 3). Vessels seem
to be round bodied; flat vessel bottoms have not been recorded. The percentage of each vessel type in the general assemblage cannot be estimated with
much accuracy at present. It appears that ladles make up a small percentage
of the total assemblage, while hemispherical bowls and neckless jars each
constitute about 25 % of a sample of 32 early rim sherds. Necked jars make up
about 50% of the early sample.
The frequency of occurrence of these vessel types may differ in later times,
although the late brownware rim sherd sample is too small to attempt definitive pronouncements. Tentatively, this late brownware assemblage appears
to have fewer neckless jars and an increasing proportion of necked jars. Neckless jars are quite uncommon in the succeeding Pueblo period.
Some painting on the exteriors of jars also seems to make its appearance in
brownware times, although it is never common. Painted examples of the

pinched-flattened brownwares are shown in Figure 4. These decorations are
simple, crude, and widely spaced. They may well be the marks of fingertips
dipped in paint and drawn over portions of the vessel in roughly parallel lines.
A trend in brownware rim shape may be toward a simple direct rim form, i.e.,
one that is rounded rather than being pinched or flattened. This rim form is
not well represented in current collections.
It appears that brownware jars diminish in frequency after 850 B.P. (A.D.
1100) or during the western Texas Pithouse to Pueblo transition period. The

decline of brownware jars appears to be synchronous with the rise of El Paso
Polychrome jars. Unpainted or scantily painted hemispherical bowls outlast
brownware jars. By early Pueblo times, these bowls appear to be the only
surviving remnants of the millennium old brownware tradition.
It is in the Pithouse to Pueblo transition, ca 850 B.P. - 750 B.P. (A.D.
1100 - A.D. 1200), that El Paso Polychrome makes its initial appearance.
Lehmer (1948) and succeeding workers (Whalen, 1977, 1978) used El Paso

Polychrome as a broad diagnostic of post Pithouse times, i.e., after 850 B.P.
(A.D. 1100). However, the type can be broken into early and late variants
which are recognizable even in very small ceramic samples.
The early variant of El Paso Polychrome was defined and described on
stylistic grounds by Whalen (1978), although firm dates were not available.
Subsequent work by Way (1979) established a firmer chronological framework for early Polychrome. Way (1979:44-51) dates the ware at 850 B.P. 700 B.P. (A.D. 1100 - A.D. 1250). The initial date relies on association of the
early Polychrome ware with Mimbres Black-on-White, a well dated intrusive
ceramic from southwestern New Mexico. Confirmation of this suggestion
comes from a recent radiocarbon date of 800 + 50 B.P. (A.D. 1150 + 50,
Tx 1735). The dated charcoal was associated with the early variant of El Paso
Polychrome at the Hueco Tanks site, east of El Paso (Kegley, 1980:10).
A ceramic thermoluminescence reading of 745 + 67 B.P. (A.D. 1233 +
67, WU-77d7) also was secured from a western Texas sherd of the early
Polychrome type (Whalen, in press). Archaeomagnetic dates on associated
features provide an approximate end for the ware, which is not present in
western Texas Pueblo period contexts dated to 690 + 18 B.P. (A.D. 1260 +
18) and 655 + 13 B.P. (A.D. 1295 + 13). Both these determinations are
archaeomagnetic dates from the Earth Science Laboratory, University of
Oklahoma. The early Polychrome variant thus seems to appear in the early or
middle 12th Century and to extend into the middle or late 13th Century in
western Texas and adjacent portions of Southcentral New Mexico.
The late variant of El Paso Polychrome, termed Classic El Paso Polychrome by Way (1979), is the best known form of the ware. It appears in the
latter half of the 13th Century. Archaeomagnetic dates (690 + 18 B.P. and
655 + 13 B.P.) denote the earliest recorded appearances of late (Classic) El
Paso Polychrome in western Texas. The ware persists until the end of the
Pueblo period in western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico. Additional
archaeomagnetic dates (Brook, 1970) and ceramic thermoluminescence
dates (Whalen, in press) place this event fairly firmly at 630 B.P. - 590 years
B.P. (A.D. 1350- A.D. 1390).
Major morphological differences between the early and late variants of El
Paso Polychrome are shape of jar rims and necks and form and extent of
vessel decoration. Early Polychrome jars have straight, near vertical necks
with globular bodies. The general shape of these jars is reminiscent of the
brownware jars of the preceding Pithouse period. Marked thickening of the
vessel lip also is present in most early Polychrome jars. Rim profiles are wedge
shaped with flattened tips. This trend finds its fullest development in the succeeding late Polychrome wares.
Late Polychrome vessels are characterized by widely flared rims (Fig. 6).
This flaring may become more extreme as the Pueblo period progresses,
although current data are inadequate for pursuit of this issue. Collection and
measurement of flare angles, together with a series of absolute dates, might
provide a useful chronological tool for subdivision of the late Pueblo period.
Further investigation certainly is warranted.
Vessel size continues to increase between late brownware and early Polychrome times. Mean vessel wall thickness in a sample of 100 early Poly-

chrome jar body sherds is 5.3 mm (standard deviation: 1.1). The mean rim
diameter for a sample of 15 early Polychrome rims is 20.3 cm (standard
deviation: 5.0). The hypothesis that early Polychrome significantly was
thicker than late brownware was tested against a null hypothesis of no significant difference. In this case, df = 198, t -- 2.14, and k = 1.96 at the .05
level, necessitating rejection of the null hypothesis. Mean vessel thickness
significantly is greater in early Polychrome jars than in late brownware jars in
this sample.
In the second case, the hypothesis that early Polychrome rim diameters
significantly were greater than late brownware rim diameters was tested
against a null hypothesis of no significant difference. Degrees of fre~edom =
33, t = 1.95, and k = 2.04 at the .05 level. The null hypothesis of no

significant difference in mean rim diameter cannot be rejected at the. 05 level.
Mean rim diameter is not significantly greater in early Polychrome than in late
brownware in this small sample.
Late Polychrome vessels continued to increase in size through the latter
part of the Pueblo period, some of the largest standing 56 cm high. Comparable figures are not available for early Polychrome jars, as whole specimens are
lacking. Mean vessel wall thickness for 100 late Polychrome jar sherds is 5.1
m m (standard deviation: 1.4). Mean rim diameter for 20 late Polychrome jars
is 25.8 cm (standard deviation: 6.6). The hypothesis that early Polychrome
significantly Was thicker than late Polychrome was t-tested against a null hypothesis of no significant difference in jar wall thickness. Degrees of freedom
were 198, t = 1.1, and k = 1.98, requiring acceptance of the null hypothesis
of no significant difference in mean vessel wall thickness.
The hypothesis that late Polychrome mean rim diameter significantly was
greater than that of early Polychrome was tested against a null hypothesis of
no significant difference. Degrees of freedom were 33, t = 2.69, and k =
2.03 at the .05 level. As t is greater than k, the null hypothesis of no significant
difference in mean rim diameter is rejected. The mean rim diameter of late
Polychrome vessels significantly is greater than that of their early Polychrome
predecessors.
The early and late variants of El Paso Polychrome are recognizable not only
by size and rim/neck shape, but also by style of painting. In both cases, black
and red geometric designs are applied in a horizontal band around the upper
third of the jar. This band of decoration is discontinuous in early Polychrome
vessels, with wide areas of brown clay body showing between black and red
stripes (Fig. 5). Painting also appears to be somewhat crude by later Polychrome standards; early Polychrome designs appear to be larger, more open,
and less intricate than their late Polychrome successors.
Figure 7 summarizes the evolutionary trends in El Paso Brown and Polychrome wares. These dates go back only to 1550 B.P. (A.D. 400), although
brown ceramics occur in western Texas in contexts as old as 1850 B.P. - 1650
B.P. (A.D. 100 - A.D. 300). Rims are not present with these oldest dated
sherds. It is not certain that the thin pinched rim characterized the area’s
earliest pottery.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Data presented indicate that the ceramics of western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico considerably are older than previously realized. These
ceramics are part of a tradition which was widespread over eastern Arizona,
southern New Mexico, and portions of northern Mexico. A corollary implication of this finding is that western Texas and Southcentral New Mexico no
longer appear to be as peripheral and underdeveloped a portion of the southwest as the traditional chronological scheme implied by assuming 1050 B.P.
(A.D. 900) as the end of the area’s preceramic period.
A second objective was to propose the first detailed developmental sequence for the area’s ceramics. This sequence is intended to be a working

model, rather than a definitive pronouncement. The proposed sequence ties
a number of stylistic attributes of local western Texas pottery to a series of
radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and ceramic thermoluminescence dates.
The sequence is not an arbitrary or stylistic ordering of rim shapes.
The progression introduced in Figure 7 recognizes central tendencies at
several points in time; too little is known about how change is made from one
to another of these rim form variants. Pinched brownware rims are recognized as earlier than flattened brownware rims, although there may be intermediate stages in which pinched and flattened forms occur together or as
ambiguous hybrids. Rates and directions of change in ceramic styles may or
may not have been uniform over a large region.
Ceramic studies in western Texas should be seen as in a formative stage.
Work to date has suggested a particular progression between several central
tendencies in rim form. Most details necessary to fill gaps in the proposed
scheme are lacking. More excavation and absolute dating of ceramics from
controlled proveniences are needed. Studying fine scale progressions of
ceramic change from the Hueco Bolson’s severely eroded surface remains
alone is difficult. Rim sherds are few in number, often badly damaged, and
their proveniences and associations frequently unclear. The area’s subsurface
ceramics are better preserved and in clearer association with each other and
with other datable materials. It is these deposits which should prove most
useful in continued refinement of the ceramic chronology of western Texas.

BOOK REVIEWS
Late Prehistoric Bison Procurement in Southeastern New Mexico: The 1978
Season at the Garnsey Site (LA-18379). By John D. Speth and William T.
Parry, with contributions by Michael Wilson, Regge N. Wiseman and Danny
N. Walker. Museum of Anthropology, The University of Michigan, Technical Report 12, Contribution 7, 1980. xvi + 369 pp. $9.00.
This monograph is a report on the second season of excavations at a series of bison
kills dating to between A.D. 1450 and A.D. 1650. The first season of excavations was
reported in an earlier monograph in the same series (Speth and Parry, 1978).
The Garnsey site is located near Roswell, New Mexico, on the southwestern
Southern High Plains (Llano Estacado). Bison kills from the late Prehistoric and Historic are not well known nor documented. As a result of the detailed reports the two
seasons of work at Garnsey, considerably more data now are available. The site can be
compared with the few other bison kills of similar age in the area (e.g., Lubbock Lake to
the northeast: Johnson, 1976; Johnson et al., 1977).
The report on the 1978 season consists of 13 sections and eight appendices. The
first four chapters contain background information on the site and methodology, essentially summarizing and updating information presented in the report on the 1977
season. Most of the rest of the report presents data with interpretations scattered
throughout.
The Introduction and Site Descriptions sections outline the objectives of the field
research and review the site situation. The site is located in a dry, filled wash that is a
tributary of the Pecos River. Recent arroyo cutting along the wash exposed portions of
the site. Research goals of the 1978 season were to clarify the stratigraphy and chronology of the site, identify discrete bone cluster, increase sample size of bison remains, and
determine if a nearby campsite (Garnsey Springs Campsite) was related to the kill.
The Excavation Procedures and Grid System sections outline, in some detail, the
methods employed in excavating the site. Methodology seemed quite adequate for the
local field situation. However, the discussion of field procedures and grid system seem
overly detailed, particularly the latter. The rationale behind the grid system and
changes in it probably are of little concern except to those working at the site.
Stratigraphy section reviews the complex sequence of arroyo cuttings, filling, and
soil formation and archeological deposits. General descriptions of the sediments within
the four geologic deposits identified are provided in the course of the discussion. This
review would be clarified considerably by inclusion of profile drawings or at least a
schematic illustration of the arroyo stratigraphy and stratigraphic and/or pedologic
descriptions of selected profiles.
Soils formed within the sediments; and each one buried by later filling are mentioned
(as paleosols) and used as stratigraphic markers. Information is lacking, however, on
the nature of the soils (horizonation, physical characteristics, degree of development).
Where soils have formed in a sedimentary sequence, origins of the deposits are only a
part of the geologic history. Soils represent periods of landscape stability, neither erosion nor deposition. The record of the period between depositional events is in the soil
itself. A discussion of the soils, then, is as equally important as the discussion of the
sediments in which the soil formed.
Preliminary textural analysis (sand, silt, clay percent) was carried out on sediments
from one deep profile with some basic statistical analyses applied to the results. However, the method employed for the textural analysis was not mentioned and the results
of the statistical analyses, although presented graphically, were not discussed.

The relationship of the bones to the stratigraphic units was determined by a computer generated "backplot" of bone provenience vs. geologic deposit. The authors
seem to make a good case for the presence of at least six bone beds.
An important consideration in the stratigraphic discussion is the extent to which the
archeological materials have been reworked and redeposited. The authors do an admirable job of dealing with this phenomenon, which apparently took place in some of
the bone concentrations.
The Chronology section is a review of radiocarbon ages secured from the site.
Fourteen bone samples were submitted for dating. In most cases, ages were determined on both apatite and gelatin. Although a majority of the samples were from one
bone bed, there is considerable range in the resulting determinations: A.D. 1360 to
A.D. 1840. Most of this section is a discussion of the problems with the ages. The
authors briefly mention the problems with dating bone and the fluctuations in atmospheric 14C levels documented for the past five centuries. Both of these factors should
be given more and serious consideration. They are significant problems and most likely
the cause of the problems with the Garnsey ages. To eliminate the problem with bone
dating, humates from the A horizons of the underlying and overlying paleosols should
be dated.
Considering the range in ages from Garnsey, the authors calculated weighted
averages and standard deviations for groups of ages that appear to be from single
events. The most probable age range for the Garnsey kills was determined by selecting
the zone within which all separate weighted averages overlap. The most probable age
range was given as A.D. 1450 to A.D. 1650.
The next three sections in the report contain discussions and analyses of the bison
remains recovered from the site. The Garnsey Bison section includes a detailed discussion of the condition and treatment of the bone, inventory, minimum number of individuals, spatial distribution, butchering, and sex. This section provides a wealth of data
for those interested in Plains bison populations.
Additional information that would be of use to researchers would be drawings of the
bone beds. Although computer generated distribution plots are provided, detailed
drawings were made for all excavated levels. Drawings of the bone beds made from
this field information would be equally informative and provide more realistic illustrations of the physical nature of the site.
The Population Dynamics of the Garnsey bison section is by Michael Wilson. He
compares the Garnsey bison with data from some of the Northern Plains archeological
sites. Although there is certainly some validity in this comparison, considering the
amount of information on bison kills in the Northern P|ains, it would seem more useful
to compare this Southern Plains kill with other Southern Plains kills such as those at
Lubbock Lake.
The Method of Bison Procurement section presents brief observations on how the
bison may have been gathered, contained, and killed. This section includes a north
south cross section of the site which would be useful in the Site Setting or Stratigraphy
sections.

Archeological materials besides the bison recovered from the site are discussed in the
next three sections: Non-Bison Remains, Lithics, and Ceramics (the latter section by
Regge N. Wiseman). Non-Bison remains is a brief review of other faunal remains. The
Lithics section presents detailed descriptions and some basic statistical analyses of lithic
tools found at the site. Diagnostic lithic tools include eight Harrell points. This particular
style was recovered from well dated contexts at Lubbock Lake in both Protohistoric
(A.D. 1450 - A.D. 1650) and aboriginal Historic levels (A.D. 1650 to A.D. 1870). In
the latter level, Harrell points are associated with Washita points. A single Washita
point was recovered from the Garnsey site in the first season of excavations (Speth and
Perry, 1978). Based on data from Lubbock Lake, this Washita point dates the Garnsey

Book Reviews

233

kills to no older than (i.e., not before) about A.D. 1650.
The Ceramics section provides a brief discussion of the 19 sherds recovered from
Garnsey. Due to small sample size and few dates associated with recovered types, only
a general age range of A.D. 900 to A.D. 1400 is provided.
Conclusions is a very general summary of the data presented previously. Considering all available information on the site, this section could have included a more wide
ranging summary.
The Conclusions is followed by eight appendices, which together account for approximately half of the monograph. The first and largest appendix presents measurements of the bison remains. The other appendices present sexed bison postcranial
elements, measurements of the lithic remains, descriptions of fire cracked rock recovered, preliminary charcoal identifications, provenience data on recovered hackberry
seeds, a note on the cataloging system, and a discussion of a canid from the site by
Danny N. Walker.
The report on the 1978 season at the Garnsey site presents a wealth of data on a
series of bison kills from the Southern High Plains. The two principal criticisms of the
report are the authors apparent lack of familiarity with regional archeology and literature and the absence of a comprehensive summary of what is known about the site.
Otherwise, this report, along with the earlier monograph, is a valuable contribution to
Southern Plains archeology in the data it contains and its timely appearance within two
years after the field season. The amount of data processed and published within such a
relatively short time is rather remarkable.

Bioarchaeology of the McCutchan-McLaughlin Site. By Mary Lucas Powell
and J. Daniel Rogers. Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, Studies in
Oklahoma’s Past, No. 5, Norman, Oklahoma, 1980.98 pages.
This monograph represents the combined efforts of Powell who analyzed the skeletal remains of 48 individuals from the McCutchan-McLaughlin site and Rogers who
described the burial patterns observed at the site. The site was described as similar to
other sites of the Fourche Maline Focus in Oklahoma. It contained two distinct cultural

234

Texas Archeological Society

components which may have been separated by a temporal hiatus of 600 years.
Cultural material from the earlier component is typified by large projectile points, while
cultural material from the upper component is typified by the presence of arrowpoints
and ceramics. Dates for the site range from 2250 B.P. to 985 B.P. (300 B.C. to A.D.
765).
Powelrs analysis of the skeletal remains includes discussions of demography, skeletal morphology, skeletal and dental pathology, and a review of health and disease in
hunter-gatherer populations. In all of these analyses, the skeletal material from the site
was treated as one sample; this approach was a research plan that the authors felt was
necessitated by the problems of assigning burials to specific cultural components at the
site.
In describing the demographic structure of the skeletal sample, Powell documented
that 31% of the individuals had died before the age of 15 years. This high mortality
rate for the skeletal sample, typical for pre-industrial societies, was still estimated to be
lower than the mortality of the actual population because the authors felt that remains
of very young individuals were poorly represented.
Among the adults, differential mortality was documented clearly. The mean age of
the females in the sample was estimated to be 32.3 years with 69.2% of the females
dying by 35. The mean age of the males, on the other hand, was 38.5 years with only
46.2 % of the males dying by 35. The authors felt this differential mortality observed in
the skeletal sample could be attributed to two possible phenomena: a proportionately
high number of females dying during pregnancy and child birth, or young males dying
away from the area and not being interred in the cemetery.
The analysis of the skeletal morphology of the McCutchan-McLaughlin sample was
restricted because of the relatively small sample size and fragmentary nature of the
material. For this reason, an assessment was not undertaken of the biological relationship of the population to other North America populations. It was possible, however,
to make some assessment of the size of the individuals and amount of sexual dimorphism present in the sample. The average size of the females was approximately
159 cm (5 ft 2 in) while the males averaged 168 cm (5 ft 6 in). Compared to other
populations, these individuals tended to be relatively small and gracile. Sexual dimorphism within the sample was typical for other populations with which it was compared.
The description of the pathologies observed on the skeletal material from this site,
and material from other sites with which it was compared, represents the longest
portion of the text. Pathologies observed in the McCutchan-McLaughlin site included
fractures, evidence of violent death, infectious diseases, arthritis, exostoses, abcesses,
osteoporotic pitting, dental pathologies, and evidence of periodic metabolic stress. In
summarizing this wealth of information about the state of health of the individuals, the
authors commented on their comparatively fine state of health. Compared to a selected Caddoan skeletal sample representative of a farming society, the McCutchanMcLaughlin site occupants suffered from far less matabolic stress and dental pathologies. On this evidence then, Powell and Rogers referred to the
McCutchan-McLaughlin population as members of Service’s original affluent society.
On the other hand, while their state of health may have been relatively good, the
number of individuals who appeared to have died violently was extremely high for
such a skeletal sample. One burial alone contained the remains of five to nine individuals who apparently had been hit and presumably killed by dart points. In addition to
these individuals, four other skeletons were associated intimately with dart points, and
presumably had been injured or died from wounds inflicted by the points.

In examining the burials for patterns of interrment, the authors considered spatial
distributions, burial orientation, artifact associations, and burial conditions. Burial positions included individuals who were buried in a tightly flexed position to individuals
who were buried in a spread position. The most frequent position for burial was moderately flexed. Orientation of individuals also was varied, but the most frequent orientation was with the spine oriented in a northwest direction.
Of the 32 burials recovered, six represented multiple burials. There appeared to be
only one other recognizable pattern in spatial distribution; that was the close approximation of some adult female and child burials. Artifacts were associated with 40% of
the burials. Artifacts commonly found in association included projectile points, unifaces, bifaces, a boat stone, seed and shell beads, bone awls, and fish hooks. Again,
there appeared to be few recognizable patterns in the distribution of these artifacts.
Three burials, however, appeared to have noteworthy artifact associations. Two
infant burials had artifact associations while six other infant and four adolescent burials
lacked artifact associations. On this evidence, the authors suggested that two infants
with artifact association may have had ascribed status. In addition to these two infants,
one multiple burial contained numerous beads associated with an adolescent and a
small boat stone associated with a male. Again, these associations were considered
significant and suggestive of ascribed status for these two individuals.
The single most interesting burial reported was the burial containing the nine individuals who the authors felt met violent death. The dart points found lodged among the
skeletons were made from material found in northeastern Oklahoma. The authors felt
these individuals, mostly females and young children, represented the victims of a
raiding party coming from north of the Arkansas River.
In reading this monograph, I was struck by how it reflects the general shift in research
orientation which is evident throughout anthropology and the social sciences. This
shift is that from mainly examining the problems of biological and cultural relationships
between populations to an emphasis on examining questions of the adaptation and
processes seen within populations. In the present study, this shift is reflected by the fact
that minimal space is devoted to questions of the structural relationships of this population to others in the area, while a great deal of space is devoted to questions concerning
the demographic structure of the population and state of health of the individuals.
The emphasis on questions of adaptation and process has come about for a variety
9f reasons. In the first place, it has been realized that small, fragmented samples typical
of recovered human skeletal remains rarely are adequate to provide information about
the small biological differences distinguishing one local population from another. On
the other hand, these small, fragmented samples often can be useful in providing
information about the state of health of the individuals. This situation is because many
pathologies are as recognizable in fragmented material as they are in complete specimens in pristine condition.
Secondly, this shift in interest is possible now because of the amount of information
that has accumulated on skeletal pathologies during the last two decades. Fourteen
years ago, Kerley and Bass’s article (1967), reviewing the prospects of paleopathology, marked a burgeoning interest in paleopathology. Approximately 10 years ago,
the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution initiated their summer
training program in paleopathology.
Today, the cumulative results of these early interests in health and local adaptations
are seen in such volumes as Steinbock’s (1976) excellent review of skeletal pathologies
and Powell and Rogers’ examination of the state of health of a regional population of
particular interest to Texas archeologists.

236

Texas Archeological Society

In addition to these very positive comments, there are some minor points of criticism. First of all, the authors’ attempt to coin a new term "bioarchaeology" for the
interdisciplinary analysis of human burials associated with archeological sites is unnecessary. The interdisciplinary study of human populations associated with archeological
sites has been going on for quite some time. The particular need to champion that
interplay by providing it with a new title does not exist. Besides, the field of anthropology is becoming so burdened already with contracted names denoting the interplay of
biological and anthropological studies that one more name only confuses the issue
rather than clarifies it.
More importantly, several typos have crept into the publication that are distracting.
Similarly, data presented in the tables could have been more consistent. Summarizing
statistics for which the sample size is not presented as in Tables 5, 6, and 8 are always
difficult to evaluate. Finally, a better selection of illustrations could have been made.
Several of the plates illustrating artifacts are referred to only perfunctorily in the text. If
they do not warrant specific description in the text, they should not be included as
illustrations. On the other hand, more illustrations of the pathologies which were
described in the text are needed. This is not a reflection of a particular ghoulish taste,
but rather a perceived need in biological anthropology. Careful descriptions of pathologies, such as the ones presented in this report, associated with good illustrations of the
pathologies, will go a long way towards helping to train other scholars in the appearance of skeletal pathologies. Such training will have to occur before producing the
necessary reports on human skeletal samples recovered in Texas can begin.

INTRODUCTION
The decision to include the first 50 volumes of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society (BTAS) in the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Microfilm Archive of Texas Archeology, and the permission of the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) Board of Directors to do so, led to the compilation of this index. Although entries for Bulletin articles are included in the
archival index, it was felt that a separate index for the Bulletin, which may be
used either with printed issues or with the microfilm, would be useful.

EXPLANATION OF THE INDEX
Author Index
The Author Index appears in bibliographical style; authors are listed alphabetically and articles by date. In addition, a cross reference is given for articles
of which an individual is a junior author. Brief, unsigned articles are attributed
in this index to the BTAS editor. The Author Index is the principal listing and
contains complete bibliographical information. Location of each article in the
Bulletin is indicated as in the following example: v27:7-100, or Vol. 27, pp.
7-100. Location of this volume in the Archive follows: a29(2), or Roll 29,
item 2 on roll.
Title Index
Article titles are listed alphabetically, excluding introductory words a, an,
and the. Each entry includes a citation of author (e.g., Witte 1936) and Iocational information for BTAS volume and Archive location. The researcher
may use this index without reference to the Author Index; however, bibliographical information is not complete, since abbreviations are used in titles
and authors’ full names are not given.

238

Texas Archeological Society

Key Word in Title Index
The key word(s) in each title, excluding county names, are listed in alphabetical order. Citations refer the researcher back to the Author Index. Although the entries almost exclusively are key words from titles, an attempt
was made to include other obvious key words that were readily apparent. For
example, names of sites in excavation or testing reports were included even if
they did not appear in the titles. In addition, some types of articles were
grouped under appropriate key words; e.g., articles dealing primarily with
burials are listed under that word, regardless of title wording.
Cross references are given to related key words or, in some instances, to
related articles by author. Although a "key word in title" index can never
prove as useful as an analytical index, it is hoped that this will serve until such
time as a computer assisted attempt at an analytical index is made.
County Index
Like the Key Word Index, these entries refer the researcher back to the
Author Index. For some early articles and those covering general areas, a
county listing could not be determined. Therefore, it is suggested that this
index be used in conjunction with appropriate key word entries such as Big
Bend br Gulf Coast.
Because of the general geographical areas covered in some articles, county
locations could not be determined accurately. Therefore, the following geographical area entries in the Key Word Index also may be consulted: Abilene
area; Big Bend; Central Texas; Coastal Bend; East Texas; East Texas,
northern; Gulf Coast; North Texas; Panhandle; South Texas; Southwest
Texas; Trans-Pecos Texas; West Texas. Out of state entries appear in a separate section at the end of the County Index.
Reviews Index
Only works reviewed are included; works merely listed in the Bulletin were
not indexed. However, the researcher is referred to such listings and bibliographies that appear in various issues. Lists of books may be found in the
following issues of the Bulletin: 11:259-266, a27(11); 24:259-260, a28(10).
In addition, the bibliography entry in the Key Word Index may be consulted.
Entries in the Reviews Index are listed alphabetically by author of work reviewed, and Iocational information is given.
