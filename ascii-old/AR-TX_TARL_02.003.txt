. ABSTRACT
From February through May, 1988, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin, conducted limited testing of eight prehistoric campsites in
the Extended San Miguel Prospect, Atascosa and McMullen counties, Texas, for
Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., agents for the San Miguel Electric Co-op. All eight
sites were systematically surface-collected; test units were hand-excavated at two sites;
and deeper sediments were backhoed at three sites. Geomorphic analyses assessed the
potential for buried sites within the prospect and the specific stratigraphy of 41MC362
and 41MC363. The majority of the recovered artifacts were lithic tools and debitage
which were analyzed following the typological and chronological framework developed
during the nearby Choke Canyon Reservoir studies. The distribution of features and
artifacts were examined through computer-generated maps to isolate specific activity
loci. Although the results were rendered inconclusive by the shallowness of the cultural
deposits, extreme erosion and modern land use, the software programs written for this
project hold great promise for future distributional studies. The large inventory of
provenienced artifacts and features recovered by this project has achieved a
representative sample of the regional material culture. A protective buffer was
established around site 41MC362 pending a decision by regulatory agencies regarding its
National Register of Historic Places eligibility.
Additional archival research and informant interviews were conducted to further develop
the history of the Maspero ranchstead, an extant house and outbuildings built on
prehistoric site 41MC364. The currently occupied structures date from the 1950s. An
older twentieth-century tenant house and shed had been razed to make room for
construction of the modern buildings. The historic research has fully documented the
evolution of the modern complex and the archeological deposits are considered too
severely disturbed to yield meaningful information.
In addition to site testing and historic research, an 800-acre tract was surveyed in
anticipation of the construction of mine auxiliary facilities. Ten prehistoric sites were
recorded and the boundaries of three known sites were expanded. Site types and
locations mirror the pattern established by earlier surveys in the prospect. A buried
feature at one site, 41MC379, demonstrated the potential for some strategraphic integrity
and preservation of organic materials. Additional testing of the deeper deposits was
recommended if future mine development includes disturbance to 41MC379.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A large and at times unwieldy project of this type requires the cooperation of many people
both in the field and in the lab. In the field, the cooperation of Monta W. Zengerle of
Morrison-Knudsen Co. Inc., S. Clyde Watkins, Don Smith, Gary Guy of Atascosa Mining
Co., and Marshall Darby of San Miguel Electric Co-op as well as their respective staffs
was invaluable to the completion of the project. A very special thanks to landowners
Eleanor and Buck Maspero for their kindness and cooperation. They also helped by
supplying information on the location and description of artifacts found on their property.
In the lab, a superb group of people helped put together the manuscript. Anne Kerr and
Kelly Lynn Scott did a fine job of editing. Dan Julien helped me understand and use the
several programs required for the project, for drawing maps and figures and for
photographic work. The TARL staff members - Leland Bement, Dan Utley, Chris Caran,
and David G. Robinson supplied invaluable information and comments. Solveig Turpin,
the Principal Investigator, deserves credit for her typically expert advice during all phases
of the project; especially through the final stages of manuscript preparation. Thanks to
Dr. Thomas R. Hester, who freely gave of his expertise in South Texas archeology. Finally,
a very special thanks to Andy Cloud, Joe Sanchez, Jeff Huebner, Bruce Ellis and Cathy
Dodt-Ellis for being a very cooperative, imaginative, and hard working field crew.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Solveig A. Turpin
Between February and May, 1988, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, carried out three cultural resource tasks in
the Extended San Miguel Prospect, Atascosa and McMullen counties, for
Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., agents for the San Miguel Electric Co-op. Surface
collections, limited test excavations, and backhoe trenching were used to assess the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility of eight prehistoric sites,
recorded in previous intensive surveys by TARL (Nightengale et ale 1988) and Texas A &
M University (Shafer and Baxter 1975). An additional 800-acre tract was surveyed in
anticipation of the construction of auxiliary facilities and the historic component of site
41MC364, the Maspero House, was reassessed. This management summary first
addresses the two subsidiary tasks before discussion of the results of NRHP testing.
Intensive Survey of 800-Acre Tract
The original survey of the Extended San Miguel Prospect encompassed 5,583 acres in
Atascosa and McMullen counties, recording 41 prehistoric sites, one with an historic
component, and reassessing 10 sites (Nightengale et ale 1988). Alterations in mine
planning called for construction of a retention pond along Hog Creek with a spillway to
La J arita Creek. An 800-acre tract adjacent to the western boundary of the extended
mine block was intensively surveyed by Leland C. Bement, Bruce A. Nightengale,
William A. Cloud, Joseph M. Sanchez, and Jeffery A. Huebner between February 16 and
25, 1988.
Ten prehistoric sites were recorded and the boundaries of three known sites (41MC364,
41MC366, and 41MC367) were extended. Eight of the newly recorded sites (41MC374
- 41MC381) are in McMullen County; two (41AT91 and 41AT92) are in Atascosa County.
The sites in the 800-acre tract mirror the types, settings and content of the larger sample
garnered in the earlier surveys. Eight of the 10 are surficial scatters of burned rock, lithic
debris, and occasional formal tools, the occupational detritus of millenia resting on a
common surface with little potential for burial by developing soils. The exceptions,
41MC378 and 41MC379, retain some potentially intact cultural deposits buried under
alluvium derived from overbank flooding of La Jarita Creek. At 41MC379, a buried
hearth exposed in a cattle trail retained charcoal that produced an uncorrected
radiocarbon date of 970Â±50 years ago. Special consideration should be given to
41MC379 if mining plans include direct disturbance to the buried deposits.

The Maspero House, 41MC364
The description of prehistoric site 41MC364, recorded in the 1985 TARL survey, included
reference to an extant ranchstead built and owned by the Maspero family (Nightengale
et ai. 1988). At the request of the Texas Historical Commission, Dan K. Utley further
researched the history of this property through archival searches and informant
interviews in May, 1988.
The Maspero ranch was once part of the holdings of Char les F. Simmons, who sold parcels
"sight unseen" to unsuspecting buyers, thus giving rise to the name "Simmons suckers."
Sometime after 1909, two tenant or rent houses were built; the first was razed in the 1940s
and the second later dismantled for scrap lumber. The area was bulldozed, the cistern
infilled, and later outbuildings erected atop the former house sites. The modern
structures were built in 1952 and expanded and remodeled in 1984.
This historic research has provided a fuller understanding of the development of the San
Miguel area by documenting the earlier sequence of land use. The extant buildings,
however, do not meet NRHP criteria for architectural or historical merit and the
archeological potential has been seriously depleted by the construction of the operating
ranch headquarters on the same sites. The material culture should be duplicated in the
disturbed deposits documented at the Burmeister Ranch (41MC102), outside the current
mine so further work at the Maspero site is not warranted.
Limited Testing Program
Of the 49 sites recorded or reassessed in the 1985 survey, 28 were considered too sparse
or disturbed to warrant testing. Only eight of the 21 sites that were selected as potential
candidates for NRHP testing will be directly affected by mine expansion. Surface
collections were conducted at all sites using a combination of flake collection transects,
dog leash units, and sampled grid squares. Shallow excavations were used to further
expose largely surficial features at 41AT77, 41MC108, and 41MC363. Controlled units
were excavated at 41AT87 and 41MC362 and deeper deposits were backhoe trenched at
41MC362, 41MC363, and 41MC367.
Geomorphic analyses, conducted by S. Chris Caran, describe the stratigraphy of selected
sites and assess the overall low potential for site burial in the prospect. The majority of
recovered artifacts, lithic tools and debitage, were classified according to the
morphological system developed during the Choke Canyon reservoir studies (Hall,
Hester, and Black 1986) and employed in both the San Miguel survey (Nightengale et al.
and Lorna Sandia cemetery assemblage analyses (Taylor and Highley n.d.). The artifacts
were then combined into discard, use, and diagnostic classes for distributional studies.
Computer-generated maps were produced in an attempt to detect activity loci and
differences between site inventories. Factors such as massive erosion, lack of soil
development, modern land use, and relic hunting have so disturbed the integrity of all
the sites that only general patterns could be discerned.

VI

One discard area was identified at 41MC360 and a Late Prehistoric chalcedony chipping
locale at 41MC108 retained some of its original configuration. A partially intact feature
at 41MC363 illustrates one probable use of the ubiquitous fire-cracked sandstone
fragments in slab-lined hearths. Occupational intensity centers around sandstone
outcrops where present, suggesting that the availability of hearth stones may have
influenced intra-site patterning.
The recovery of sandstone grinding implements at seven of the tested sites suggests an
emphasis on the processing of vegetal staples, the tools fashioned from convenient
outcrops of raw materials. The limited and poorly preserved faunal remains recovered
in subsurface testing only generally indicate that diverse mammalian and aquatic species
were procured. The freshwater bivalves, identified by Dr. Raymond Neck, however,
suggest past environments with more abundant water sources than are available in the
intermittent streams of today. The lithic assemblage reflects procurement of raw
material from readily-available gravels on the creek divides and the entire sequence of
tool production and maintenance. Chronological indicators span the full range of
prehistory with an apparent increase in occupational intensity or population density from
Middle Archaic through early Late Prehistoric times. One detectable shift in the
settlement pattern may be a move toward valley exploitation in the late phase of the Late
Prehistoric period. The tentative trends in the San Miguel occupational sequence are
lent credence by their similarity to reconstructions of Choke Canyon settlement patterns
over time.
The large inventory of provenienced artifacts and features recovered by this project
achieved a representative samp]e ofthe cultural material at each site and additional work
is unlikely to produce new information relevant to regional research problems. Concerns
for the potential eligibility of 41MC362 for listing on the NRHP have been addressed by
protecting the site until a decision is reached by the regulatory agencies. The results of
the geomorphic, lithic and distributional studies offer some considerations for future
work in the San Miguel prospect and in similar settings. Caran estimates that the
potential for the recovery of stratified deposits is extremely low, improving as the
floodplains widen down stream of the current project area. The denuded divides and
slopes, as demonstrated in this and previous testing, may retain considerable cultural
material but not in their original context. The distributional studies discerned a very
few localized areas where some functional or temporal affiliation could be inferred but,
generally, concentrations of cultural material appeared more the product of
post-depositional disturbance than prehistoric activities. The flaw is not in the studies
but in the disturbances provoked by modern land use, repeated prehistoric occupations
in the same location, erosion, and soil characteristics. The software programs written for
this project are resident at TARL and should prove useful in for overall mapping and
distributional studies on more intact sites.
A third consideration highlighted by this project is the utility of the lithic typology devised
for the Choke Canyon project. Using this nomenclature provides comparability in the
analysis of lithic assemblages from the south Texas region, but it is primarily
morphological so many of the groups and forms lack temporal and functional
implications. Cross-referencing the Choke Canyon categories with named types and

vii

correlating the sub-classes to lithic reduction strategies greatly increases the interpretive
potential of the typology.
In composite t the findings of the Phase III testing program suggest a re-thinking of future
work in the prospect is appropriate. The sites previously recommended for intensive
surface collectiont if potentially affected by development, may still merit data recovery
similar to that described in this report but not at a comparable level of investment. Any
potential for intact, buried deposits should, of course, be exploited but collections may
well be better-aimed at answering specific questions oriented toward technology,
function and chronology. Thus, small, single component sites and the rare intact activity
loci gain in importance over the large, dispersed and disturbed artifact scatters. In
addition, the growing evidence for a hierarchy of sites should be augmented by careful
recording and collection during intensive survey so that the sample of tested sites can be
reduced to those where information beyond a general surface collection can be acquired.

INTRODUCTION
Between February 17 and May 6, 1988, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
(TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, conducted Phase III testing to evaluate the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility of eight prehistoric sites in the
Extended San Miguel Lignite Prospect in Atascosa and McMullen counties, Texas
(Fig. 1). The studies were sponsored by Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., agents for
the San Miguel Electric Co-op, in compliance with provisions of the State Surface Mining
Act, prerequisite to application for lignite surface mining.
The investigations reported herein are a continuation of cultural resource assessments
begun in the original San Miguel Prospect in 1974 by Texas A & M University (Shafer
and Baxter 1975; Usrey, Grysinski, and Bond 1978; Usrey 1980). In 1985, TARL conÂ­
ducted an intensive survey of 5,583 acres in the Extended San Miguel Prospect, recording
41 prehistoric sites, one with a historic component, and reevaluating 10 sites in the
original prospect (Nightengale et al. 1988). Three of the previously recorded sites were
combined, bringing the total prospect inventory to 49 sites.
The prehistoric sites were classified into multiple and limited functional categories and
by topographic settings of valley, upland margin, and upland divide following the strategy
initiated by Shafer and Baxter (1975). The limitations imposed by relic hunting, erosion,
and modern land use effectively eliminated 28 of the 49 prehistoric sites in the extended
prospect from further consideration. Of the 21 remaining sites, only 41AT77, 41AT86,
41AT87, 41MC108, 41MC360, 41MC362, 41MC363, and 41MC367 will be directly afÂ­
fected by mine development. These sites, however, provide a sample of all three
physiographic zones and two site types for comparison with extant models for upland
settlement in south Texas (Shafer and Baxter 1975; Hester 1976a, 1976b, 1980, 1981), and
lowland patterns described by Hall, Hester, and Black (1986).
Two additional tasks were accomplished in 1988. The intensive survey of an 800-acre
tract adjacent to the previously surveyed area produced 10 prehistoric site recordings
(Appendix 1). Two of those 10 sites, 41MC378 and 41MC379, were assessed as holding
potential for buried deposits and recommended for special consideration if disturbed by
future construction. An evaluation of the Maspero ranch complex, an unrecorded hisÂ­
toric component of site 41MC364, was requested by the Texas Historical Commission
after the publication of the extended prospect survey report. The results of the historic
research, conducted in May, 1988 by Dan K. Utley, are reported in Appendix 2.
The 800-acre intensive survey was conducted by TARL archeologists Leland C. Bement,
Bruce A. Nightengale, and William A. Cloud. The testing program was carried out by
William A. Cloud, Joseph Sanchez, Jeffery A. Huebner, W. Bruce Ellis, and Cathy
Dodt-Ellis under the supervision of Bruce A. Nightengale. Monitoring of construction

at site 41MC376 was the responsibility of W. Bruce Ellis. The lithic analysis was comÂ­
pleted by Cheryl Lynn Highley, the geomorphology by S. Chris Caran, and the historic
research by Dan K. Utley. Daniel G. Julien wrote the software used to convert stadia
readings and artifact proveniences into distribution maps. Special studies include verÂ­
tebrate faunal identification by Leland C. Bement, ceramic description by David G.
Robinson, molluscan faunal analysis by Raymond Neck, and phytolith analysis by Michael
Marchbanks. Solveig A. Turpin acted as Principal Investigator and authored sections of
the report.
The report is organized into seven chapters, references cited, and four appendices. This
introduction is followed by a summary of previous archeological research in the region
and a discussion of interpretive models as Chapter 2, authored by David G. Robinson and
Bruce A. Nightengale. The methods used in data recovery and analysis are summarized
in Chapter 3. The environmental setting of the prospect sites was fully described in
Nightengale et al. 1988 and will not be repeated. Chapter 4, the geomorphological
section, by S. Chris Caran, reports information specifically intended to assess the arÂ­
cheological potential of the prospect and the few sites where erosion has not completely
eradicated natural and cultural stratigraphy. Chapter 5, by C.L. Highley, describes the
artifact assemblage collected from the prospect sites within the typological and
chronological framework estab1ished in the Choke Canyon analyses (Hall, Black and
Graves 1982; Hall, Hester and Black 1986) and applied to Lorna Sandia, a large prehisÂ­
toric cemetery in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley n.d.). The lithic inventory is
placed within its site-specific context in Chapter 6, Site Analysis, and Chapter 7 sumÂ­
marizes the findings of the testing program. The results of the additional survey, the
historic research, molluscan analysis, and phytolith identification are appended.
Both survey and testing programs were designed to comply with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 as amended and the National Environmental Policy Act and its
related regulations (50CFR4) as implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency.
These cultural resource assessments conform to criteria and guidelines for Phase II and
Phase III investigations set forth by the Texas Historical Commission and performance
standards recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Since the survey of the Extended San Miguel Prospect in 1985 (Nightengale et al. 1988)
research has shed new light on the cultural sequence of prehistoric settlement in the sou th
Texas region. Most notably, in the final volume of the Choke Canyon Series, Hall, Hester,
and Black (1986) use 47 radiocarbon dates to refine the prehistoric chronology for this
area of the confluence of the Atascosa, Frio, and Nueces rivers. This new information
has been incorporated into this background summary.

CHRONOLOGY
The cultural historical sequence of the of south Texas region has been divided into four
periods: the Paleoindian (ca. 9000 B.C. to 6000 B.C.), the Archaic (6000 B.C. to A.D. 900),
the Late Prehistoric (A.D. 900 to A.D. 1650), and the Historic (A.D. 1528 to present) (Hall,
Hester, and Black 1986). These have been defined on the basis of subsistence strategies,
artifacts, geographic associations, and radiocarbon dates. The Historic period is, addiÂ­
tionally, characterized by the keeping of written records. Refinements within the Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods have resulted in the following subdivisions: Early Archaic,
6000 B.c. to ca. 2500 B.C.; Middle Archaic, ca. 2500 B.C. to 400 B.C.; Late Archaic, 400 B.C.
to A.D. 900; Late Prehistoric, A.D. 900 to A.D. 1400, and A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1650.
Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period began with the arrival of North America's first inhabitants, who
spread rapidly to all ice-free regions of the continent. These people practiced non-speÂ­
cialized gathering strategies and the hunting of Pleistocene megafauna, such as mammoth
and mastodon, as well as a now extinct species of bison (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Shafer
and Baxter 1975; Hester 1976b). Major time-diagnostic Paleoindian artifacts are stone
tools, notably Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Angostura projectile
point types. Paleoindian activity in the project area is reflected in surface finds from
several sites and the relative abundance of characteristic projectile point types in private
collections from sites along San Miguel Creek (Hester 1968). Paleoindian surface finds
in the upland San Miguel lignite project area suggest that all of the physiographic zones
from creekside to upland margin and divide were used. In the lowland river valley of
Choke Canyon, surface artifacts indicate settlement along the crests of high old terrace
remnants in the Frio River floodplain and along various of its tributaries such as San
Miguel Creek. Surface finds were also located on the slope and upland edge of valley
margins (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:394).

6 / ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Megafaunal remains have been reported in the immediate vicinity of the project area.
Mammoth remains were found along La Parita Creek approximately 10 km north of the
project area, but there was no sign of associated human activity (Kay Hindes 1988
personal communication; TARL files). Climatic conditions, extrapolated from the
Lower Pecos area and the Southern Plains to the north, appear to have been wetter and
cooler during the early part of the period with drier conditions during the latter part
prompting faunal and vegetation shifts (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The slow shift in
climatic conditions probably accounted for the demise of megafauna in the region,
thereby causing a slow but steady shift in hunting strategies to accomodate the void.
Although cultural activity attributed to Paleoindian occupation has been recognised in
south Texas, the period remains largely enigmatic as few well defined sites have been
excavated to date.
Early Archaic Period

The Early Archaic period in south Texas remains ill-defined. Hypothethically, the
economy continued to rely on hunting and gathering/foraging strategies developed during
the Paleoindian period. The extinction of megafauna led to a change in the tool kit.
Lanceolate projectile points were replaced by dart point styles such as Bandy, Andice,
Bell, and Early Triangular. Distally beveled tools such as Clear Fork and Guadalupe are
also present. Clear Fork tools are considered generally characteristic of the period,
occurring in both Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic contexts (Thrner and Hester
1985:205; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:395). Carbonized wood samples from 41LK51 in
Choke Canyon radiocarbon dated to the range from 5130 B.C. to 3450 B.C. (Hall, Hester,
and Black 1986:397). The carbonized wood sample was identified as Prosopis or Acacia
(mesquite) indicating the early presence of this modern brush species in the lowland river
valley (Holloway 1986). Holloway (1986:447) suggests that the combination of faunal,
pollen, and charcoal data from Choke Canyon indicate a relatively stable environment
with increasing xeric conditions during the last 6000 years. Other researchers in Texas
have suggested that an increased drying trend during the Early Archaic greatly affected
prehistoric utilization of the terrain (Story 1985). The small size and wide distribution
of Early Archaic sites on the West Gulf Coastal Plain led Story (ibid.:37) to conclude that
aboriginal groups were small with large ranging areas probably not bound by territorial
strictures. During times of increased aridity, populations would concentrate in the more
well-watered areas, such as the Balcones Escarpment, where resources would be more
abundant because of higher rainfall and persistent springs.
Middle Archaic Period

In contrast to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic has been proposed as a period of
increasing population density, more mesic climatic conditions, and more specialized use
of the vegetal resources. Hall, Hester, and Black (1986:398) arbitrarily set 2500 B.C. as
the division between the Early Archaic and Middle Archaic periods. The decision was
based on a radiocarbon date from 41LK31132 in the valley and the " ... approxima te

CHRONOLOGY I 7

temporal juncture of these two periods in central Texas and the Lower-Pecos" (ibid.).
Lithic tools characteristic of the period include limited numbers of stemmed dart point
styles, Langtry, Morhiss, and Pedemales from bordering cultural regions such as the
Trans-Pecos, coastal Texas, and central Texas. Unstemmed thin bifaces (Groups 2,3, and
4) were more abundant. Bifaces similar to Group 2 were identified at Lorna Sandia
(41LK28) as Tortugas (Taylor and Highley n.d.). Also associated with the period are
distally beveled tools (Groups 3 and 4), which were found in burial caches dating to the
late Middle Archaic at Lorna Sandia (Taylor and Highley n.d.). Burned rock concentraÂ­
tions appear as substantial well-integrated rock clusters which might have functioned as
roasting or baking hearths. Story (1985:44) suggests that increased population density
may have limited group movement during the period such that territorial boundaries
began to appear. Story (ibid.) also proposes that cemeteries signify a group's continued
access to an area, and therefore may be an indication of territoriality. The Lorna Sandia
Site (41LK28) is a cemetery where researchers found predominantly south Texas cultural
material dating from the late Middle Archaic in association with intact burials (Taylor
and Highley n.d.). It is likely that the cemetery population was derived from groups
involved in exploitation of the multiple resources expected at the confluence of three
main rivers.
Late Archaic Period

During the early part of the Late Archaic period, settlement patterns within the Choke
Canyon area continued the Middle Archaic tendency to occupy the total range of
environmental zones represented in that project area (Hall, Hester and Black 1986).
Artifacts associated with the period include stemmed dart points such as Ensor, Ellis, Frio,
Marcos, and Fairland, as well as various triangular points. Distally beveled tools (Groups
3 and 4), also associated with the Middle Archaic period, are still found, but to a lesser
extent, as are the unstemmed thin bifaces, burned rock concentrations, and grinding
implements common to the Middle Archaic assemblages. Hall, Hester, and Black
(1986:401) found that the Middle and Late Archaic periods represent the most intensive
occupations in Choke Canyon. Toward the end of the period, from about A.D. 200 to A.D.
800, aboriginal occupation within the Choke Canyon area is significantly underÂ­
represented (ibid.:405); whether this is the result of sampling error or an actual cultural
manifestation remains to be seen.
Late Prehistoric Period

The Late Prehistoric period represents a period of marked change from the preceding
settlement pattern and tool assemblage. Sites from this period in Choke Canyon occupy
areas along major stream channels and tributaries as well as along natural levees of relict
channels ofthe same drainages (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:403). The same preference
for streamside occupation along now-intermittent drainages was observed in Zavala
County (Hester 1978). These drainages probably flowed with more regularity prior to
historic depletion of the water table (Hester 1978:1). The introduction of the bow and

8 I ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

arrow, pottery, and lithic tool forms divergent from earlier tool kits are examples of the
pronounced change that occurred within the material culture. The distally beveled tools
and dart points of earlier assemblages are noticeably absent. Burned rock concentrations
are less massive or not as well-integrated as earlier features; considerably less burned
rock is found with Late Prehistoric components (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:404-405).
Lithic tools are represented by Scallom and Edwards arrow points during the early
subperiod of AD. 900 to AD. 1400. They are replaced by Perdiz arrow points in the later
subperiod, AD. 1400 to AD. 1650. Bone-tempered ceramics begin to appear in the early
subperiod and predominate in the later sub period (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:387).
Other tools associated with the later subperiod include beveled knives, unifacial side and
end scrapers, and perforators. Faunal remains from Choke Canyon sites indicate a
broader range of fauna was exploited than during Archaic times. The emphasis appears
to have been on larger game animals such as deer and bison (Steele and Assad-Hunter
1986:468).
Historic Period

The Historic period began in AD. 1528 with Cabeza de Vaca's transit of South Texas.
Indians of the Coahuiltecan linguistic group lived in the region and were divided into
hundreds of discrete bands (Campbell and Campbell 1981). They pursued a way of life,
persisting from the Archaic through the Late Prehistoric, described as semi-nomadic, a
pattern which included the habitation of temporary villages usually located near streams
and the use of hunting and gathering subsistence strategies. They were patrilineal and
patrilocal, with inheritance through the male line. Their society was egalitarian, in which
social status was earned rather than inherited (Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley 1977, Table
3:28-29). In the upper coastal area of the region, the territories of the Karankawas and
Tonkawas bordered that of the Coahuiltecans.
One of the better recorded South Texas Coahuiltecan groups, the Mariames, ranged in
this cultural border zone along the Guadalupe River during the fall, winter, and spring.
They reportedly migrated in the summer as far as 80 miles southwestward to tracts of
fruit-bearing prickly pear cactus in the regions west of Corpus Christi Bay (Campbell
1983:351). This seasonal territory lay near the present project area. The Guadalupe
River region and the inland plain constituted the two poles of the Mariame's bipolar
seasonal territory. The project area also lies centrally within Campbell's (1983:353,356)
Area 3, peopled by less well-defined groups, such as the Pampopas and Aguastayas, who
ranged between lands along the upper half of the San Antonio River and as far as 100
miles southward, along the two great bends of the Nueces River.
The Historic period was one of stress and displacement for the Coahuiltecans, who were
profoundly affected by the colonizing and missionizing efforts of the Spanish from the
south and by the raiding Lipan Apaches from the north (Newcomb 1961). The result was
the eventual disappearance of the long-standing aboriginal cultures of South Texas.

PREVIOUS WORK

Atascosa and McMullen counties comprise a rich archeological area. Currently 99 sites
have been recorded in Atascosa County, most of these on the San Miguel Lignite
Prospect, and 381 sites were located in McMullen County (TARL files). Studies by Shafer
and Baxter (1975) and Nightengale et al. (1988) are the major cultural resource invenÂ­
tories in Atascosa County. The follow-up mitigation to Shafer and Baxter (1975)
consisted of controlled surface collection and some excavation of nine sites in the
uplands of the original project area (Usrey, Grysinski, and Bond 1978; Usrey 1980). On
the basis of point typology, the heavily deflated sites were assigned to the Paleoindian
and the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. Another study in the county
reported four lithic scatter sites distributed from the flood plains to the uplands and one
occupation site located on an upland divide (McGraw 1979a).
A large proportion of the sites in McMullen County were recorded during the Choke
Canyon Reservoir investigations. More than 400 sites dating from the Paleo indian
through Historic periods have now been recorded and investigated in this Frio River
Valley reservoir in Live Oak and McMullen counties (Sorrow, O'Malley, and Fox 1974;
Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley 1977; Hall, Black, and Graves 1982; Hall, Hester, and Black
1986). Small-scale projects in upland zones (Dusek 1980; Robinson 1980) and studies of
surface collections (Hester 1968; Hemion 1979) have enlarged the cultural and environÂ­
mental picture of the prehistory in this area. Many of these efforts have been reported
over the years in La Tierra, the journal of the South Texas Archaeological Association.
The counties surrounding Atascosa and McMullen counties show varying amounts of
archeological research. To the north and east, the Bexar County site inventory exceeds
700 and is rapidly increasing in response to urbanization (TARL files). Bexar County
contains metropolitan San Antonio, and three factors account for the high number of
recorded sites: 1) The Balcones Escarpment located in the northern part of the county,
attracted prehistoric groups as it is a major ecotone and therefore an abundant resource
area (Story 1985); the Escarpment is also considered a diffuse cultural boundary between
central Texas and south Texas prehistoric regions, 2) San Antonio has been an important
center throughout the historic period, thus creating many significant sites, and 3) San
Antonio's urban growth has resulted in numerous archeological investigations - manÂ­
dated, voluntary, or accidental. The Center for Archeological Research (CAR), The
University of Texas at San Antonio, has led the research in Bexar County.
Presently, Wilson County has 77 recorded sites (TARL files). Fifty-five of these sites
were identified by Hsu and Ralph (1968) during the Cibolo Creek Reservoir Project.
Primarily prehistoric, the sites largely consisted of lithic scatters lacking in temporally or
culturally diagnostic artifacts. Subsequently, CAR excavated 41WN73, a burial and
occupation site, for the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(Labadie 1988). Excavations revealed scattered fragments of at least three burials
located on an elevated area along the western floodplain of the San Antonio River.
Diagnostic artifacts from central and south Texas suggested Archaic through Late PrehisÂ­
toric occupations.

10 / ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

There have been 87 sites recorded in Karnes County (TARL files). Two major research
projects were conducted in the Ecleto Creek watershed by the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (Crawford 1971) and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter and Guy 1980).
Together they investigated 18 prehistoric sites and one historic site. The Conquista
Project cultural resources inventory in Karnes County recorded four prehistoric sites and
isolated cultural material (McGraw 1979b; Roemer 1980). Survey of the Texaco-Sunedco
Hobson Uranium Prospect (Nightengale and Bement 1982) in western Karnes County
yielded two isolated finds and one site, where the observed inventory included 12 flakes,
1 core, 1 core tool, and 1 dart point medial fragment; none of these artifacts were
temporally or culturally diagnostic.
To the east of Atascosa and McMullen counties, Live Oak County has contributed
immensely to current knowledge of south Texas prehistory. Two hundred eighty-three
sites have been recorded in the county (TARL files). Organized research in Live Oak
County has taken place over a comparatively short span of time, beginning with
Wakefield's (1968) survey of 18 archeological sites in the proposed Choke Canyon
Reservoir. This initial work was followed by a survey and excavation by the Texas
Historical Commission and the Center for Archeological Research, The University of
Texas at San Antonio. The results have been summarized in the McMullen County
discussion; this research project laid the groundwork for future archeological research
in south Texas (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986; Hall, Black, and Graves 1982; Lynn, Fox,
and O'Malley 1977; Sorrow, O'Malley, and Fox 1974).
In 1977 and 1978, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation excavated

a site of major importance in the Atascosa River flood plain/terrace margin north of the
town of Three Rivers. Site 41LK28 is a cemetery site which contained more than 160
prehistoric burials and artifacts dated to the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric
stages. Undisturbed interments were predominantly late Middle Archaic in age (Taylor
and Highley n.d.). Continuing site and artifact analysis is expected to shed light on
Archaic lifeways, burial patterns, and interaction between the central Texas and south
Texas culture regions (Hester 1981:123-124; Taylor and Highley n.d.).
The Texas Archeological Survey initiated archeological assessments in the Three Rivers
Flood Protection Project in 1975. The project was situated on the Frio River flood plain
at Three Rivers, and investigations recorded 16 prehistoric and 3 historic sites or
components. Analysis of the prehistoric sites demonstrated functional variations
between them with overall emphasis on mussel collecting and lithic resource
procurement (Mallouf 1975, 1977; Prewitt and Scott 1977; Dibble 1979; Pliska 1980).
Small-scale research projects in the county have contributed additional information on
prehistoric occupation. Creel et al. (1979) excavated 41LK106, a site on Sulphur Creek
in western Live Oak County. Artifacts suggested site occupations at various times from
the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. In a survey for the Conquista Project,
McGraw (1979a) found two sites in the upland divide physiographic setting, one of which
is classified as a light lithic scatter; the other is little more than a rock hearth. Survey and
testing at 41LK117, on an alluvial terrace and adjacent upland above Sulphur Creek,
defined Early, Middle, and Late Archaic occupations (Smith 1978). Investigations by the

PREVIOUS WORK / 11

Texas Archeological Survey have found similar upland site types and patterning
(Robinson 1983a, 1983b).
To the west, Frio and LaSalle counties border the Atascosa and McMullen county area.
At present, Frio County contains 22 recorded archeological sites (TARL files). The
majority are open campsites along major drainages recorded as a result of surveys by the
State Department of Highways and Transportation. Most are diffuse scatters of lithic
debris that have been subjected to surface assessment. In LaSalle County, several of the
26 recorded sites have been more closely scrutinized by professionals and avocationalists.
Sites 41LS1, 41LS3 and 41LS8 were reported by Hester, White, and White (1969). The
outcome was an inventory of lithic material found on the surface of the 40-acre Oulline
Site (41LS3) and at six other sites in the vicinity. All the sites were found in the uplands
along secondary tributaries of Jahuey Creek, a right-bank tributary of the Frio River.
Unstemmed and stemmed projectile points were found with cores, tools, and debitage.
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric temporal indicators suggest a long span of
occupation. From the assemblage, the authors were able to define a lunate beveled tool
known as the Nueces tool, which is common to many assemblages in south Texas. The
predominance of stemmed versus unstemmed projectile points was noted in the asÂ­
semblage. Further, it was observed that more varieties of stemmed points were present
in assemblages north of the Nueces River then to the south of the river where assemblages
were dominated by unstemmed triangular point styles (ibid.:161-162). Krieger (1948)
noted the same pattern earlier although he used the Frio River as the boundary. The
proximity to central Texas and Lower-Pecos stemmed-point traditions would account for
much of the influence. To the south, along the western margins of the Nueces River, a
pipeline survey in the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area focused on dry upland areas
(McGraw 1986). Sites were small sparse encampments probably occupied for a short
time. Temporal diagnostics suggest Late Prehistoric occupations. During a negative
survey of a well pad in the same area, Hall (1986) suggested distance from reliable water
sources as a reason for sparse utilization of those particular upland areas.
To the south and southwest of the Atascosa and McMullen County area lie Duval and
Webb counties. At present, 59 sites have been recorded in Duval County (TARL files).
Cultural resource surveys within the county have found sites of similar function and
content (Black 1986b; Prewitt and Nance 1980). Two recent surveys by the TARL led to
the recording of 15 prehistoric sites and 1 multi-component historic/prehistoric site (Ellis
and Dodt-Ellis 1988a, 1988b). The sites were large open campsites, consisting of diffuse
and highly disrupted scatters of lithic material, located on the eastern edge of a divide
along header tributaries of creeks feeding into Baffin Bay. Temporal diagnostics, mainly
unstemmed projectile points and distally beveled tools, suggest Archaic and Late PrehisÂ­
toric occupations. The sites probably functioned as intermittent encampments with
multiple tasks being accomplished during the stay. To the west, Webb County contains a
total of 108 recorded sites (TARL files). Webb County cultural chronology extends back
to Clovis times in the Paleoindian period. Nunley (1971) conducted the most extensive
study in the region, in the lowlands along the Rio Grande from Falcon Dam to Laredo.
He examined materials from 50 Archaic sites, seeking to determine sociocultural units.
Five such units with territorial restrictions were perceived based on artifact and asÂ­
semblage styles. Gibson (1981) surveyed an upland area in southeastern Webb County

12 I ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

and found 12 sites, functionally classified as two cobble-acquisition locations, four
flint-working sites, two field camps, one hunting camp and three residential base camps.
McGraw (1983) recorded eight prehistoric sites during a pipeline survey along the
terraces of the Rio Grande. Large open campsites contained tools, unstemmed projectile
points, burned rock clusters, and ground stone. Three burials were recorded at 41WB20.
The remains of a flexed adult male were found in one interment and a semi-flexed adult
female with an infant of about six months of age were found in another grave. Included
with the woman were bone beads from a necklace and bracelet as well as a mussel shell
pendant (ibid.:29-45). Kenmotsu and Nightengale (1980) found two sites in the highest
elevations in the county, one (41 WB79) a lithic scatter, the other (41 WB80) an artifact
scatter with stone tools. The diagnostics included a Tortugas point and a Perdiz point.
Recent survey and excavation by the TARL (Bement and Rowan 1988) of an area adjacent
to the one surveyed by Kenmotsu and Nightengale (1980) resulted in the recording of
eight small open campsites farther in the uplands, with subsequent testing at one,
41WBI01. Site surfaces retained evidence of scattered cultural debris attributable to
short term encampments with temporal diagnostics suggesting Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations. Although one unidentified stemmed arrow point was found at
a site, the majority of diagnostics belong to the unstemmed projectile point categories
ubiquitous across south Texas. Follow-up testing at 41WBI0l found mixed and shallow
deposits at a campsite where primary and secondary lithic reduction tasks were being
accomplished during the Middle and Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric (Bement and
Rowan 1988). Ellis and Dodt-Ellis (1988b) recorded three sites, which were mainly large
open campsites with diffuse lithic scatters, in Webb County,.
In Zavala County, on the western edge of the south Texas cultural region, a total of 336
sites have been recorded by professional and avocational archeologists (TARL files).
The large areal survey of the Chapparosa Ranch during the early 1970s and subsequent
excavations at 41ZV83 helped form the basis for settlement pattern reconstruction in
south Texas (Hester and Hill 1975; Hester 1978; Montgomery 1978). Open campsites
were found along upland tributaries of the Nueces River where many of the now interÂ­
mittent drainages were once perennial sources of water before historic land-use lowered
the water table and limited the flow to seasonal flow and flooding (Hester 1978:1). Sites
along the channels were found to date from the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic periods
while those found at mid-flood plain and along nearby ridges dated earlier (Hester 1978).
Sites in the uplands became more dispersed with limited debris from what were probably
short duration encampments utilizing a limited resource base (see Research Models).
Excavation at the Holdsworth (41ZVI4) and Stewart (41ZVI21) sites expanded the
understanding of settlement and subsistence patterns in south Texas (Hester and Hill
1972). In 1981, the Chacon East Project (McGraw and Knepper 1983) recorded 149 sites
during a survey of approximately 30,000 acres of a proposed lignite mining area in the
northwestern portion of Zavala County and the southwestern portion of Uvalde County;
the area is approximately 10 km north of the Chapparosa study area. Sites were found
along intermittent right-bank tributaries of the Nueces River and portions of the
mainstream river. Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric temporal diagnostics were found
at open campsites with scattered tools and debitage from encampments probably used to
exploit a variety of resources. Stemmed projectile points dominate an assemblage also
including unstemmed projectile points, distally beveled tools, cores, bifaces, and utilized

PREVIOUS WORK I 13

debitage. McGraw and Knepper (1983) suggested that hydrological changes~ namely
stream pirating, may have accounted for variation in settlement patterns. Early sites were
found along a dry tributary which had been captured by another stream while Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric settlement concentrated along the flowing tributary
(ibid.:6).

Dimmit County, which borders the southern edge of Zavala County, contains a total of
179 recorded sites (TARL files). The majority of work in the county can be attributed to
research during the 1960s by students from the Carrizo Springs High School ArcheologiÂ­
cal Society (TARL files) and the Dimmit County Archeological Survey (Nunley and
Hester 1966). From 1963 through 1970, about 76 sites were recorded along upland
tributaries of the Nueces River and along portions of the river proper. The sites were
mostly open campsites with varying amounts of lithic debris, tools, burned rock, and in
some cases, ceramics and burials. Occupations spanned the prehistoric through the
historic. At least two sites contained worked marine shell (Hester 1971).
The foregoing discussions have presented a picture of current archeological research in
the area surrounding Atascosa and McMullen counties to date. A detailed and incisive
summary of South Texas archeological research~ compiled by Carol Graves, can be found
in Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:7-25).
The San Miguel Lignite Project Area
The project area in Atascosa and McMullen counties investigated by Shafer and Baxter
(1975), extended from San Miguel Creek to the initial mining areas along La Parita
Creek. Eighty-five prehistoric sites were recorded and classified by function and
physiographic location. Of these, 6 were recommended for subsurface testing and 19 for
surface collection (ibid.:79). Except for 41AT22, located in the La Parita valley, all sites
recommended for subsurface testing were found in the San Miguel Creek valley. The
remaining sites from the uplands and valleys retained minimal depth of deposit but
appeared to contain significant regional data; therefore, in order to supplement survey
collections and mitigate adverse impact, they were selected for surface collection.
Usrey, Grysinski and Bond (1978) conducted follow-up mitigation of two upland sites,
41AT22 and 41AT24, in the original prospect. Additional mitigation by Usrey (1980) at
seven more sites yielded Paleo indian material, along with evidence of Middle Archaic
through Late Prehistoric occupations. Both mitigation efforts applied a method of
mapping and systematic surface collection. The results demonstrated that advanced
deflation led to shallow or only surface cultural deposits in the uplands. Eight of the
mitigated sites may be classed as multifunctional.
Shafer and Baxter (1975) recorded 10 sites within the 1985 extended permit area. Sites
41MC101-41MC108, 41MC124 and 41MC125, originally recorded by Shafer and Baxter
(1975), were representative of sites in each of the three physiographic zones. In 1975,
41MC103 and 41MC106 were recommended for surface collection. The 1985 survey by
Nightengale et al. (1988) reiterated the recommendation that 41MC108 be surface

14 I ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

collected. Revised project boundaries and a decision to surface collect only a sample of
sites led to the deletion of 41MC103 and 41MC106 from the list. As yet, no sites within
the present mining area nor in the extended permit area have been determined eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places.
Shafer and Baxter's (1975) study provided a practical foundation for site typologies and
physiographic zones used in the extended permit area survey (Nightengale et al. 1988).
Originally, the typology consisted of lithic scatters, multiple function, limited function,
and lithic resource procurement site types but the last category was eleminated due to
under representation. The lithic scatters, large and small, were frequently found on
upland divides, but they also were encountered on stream terrace lowlands and valÂ­
ley/upland margins. More complex multiple function sites, or habitation sites, were most
frequently located on stream terrace lowlands. Thus, although all microenvironments in
the proposed survey area were utilized prehistorically, the more complex sites conÂ­
centrate in the stream terrace lowlands, especially those alongside La Jarita, Hog,
Caballos, and Salt Branch creeks. Furthermore, considering environmental factors,
upland sites were expected to be deflated and lacking in subsurface contexts while stream
terrace sites held some potential for burial, possibly stratified by alluvial creek deposits.
These factors are relevant to the determination of site significance in the proposed
project area.
The pedestrian survey of the extended lignite permit boundary area was conducted by
the TARL in 1985 (Nightengale et al. 1988). Forty-nine prehistoric sites were recorded
within an approximate 5500-acre area. Included were the valleys of La Jarita, Hog, and
Salt Branch creeks as well as adjacent margins and uplands. Only multiple function and
limited function site categories were retained from Shafer and Baxter's (1975) functional
categories. Physiographic zones remained the same. Twenty-one sites were recomÂ­
mended for further analysis. Except for three limited function sites, sites fit the multiple
function category. Eleven sites, mostly in the La Jarita valley, were recommended for
subsurface testing. The remaining sites, though considered somewhat disturbed by
erosion and surface collection by relic hunters, were thought to retain significant regional
research potential for extensive surface collection. The survey results suggested an
overlapping pattern of seasonal site use, with upland localities utilized during wetter
periods of the year when more abundant resources could be exploited either by larger
groups or more often. During the drier periods, when resources were less abundant, the
upland sites were probably being used by smaller groups or less often.
RESEARCH MODELS

The cultural past of south Texas was dominated by hunting and gathering strategies which
continued late into the Historic period. Hunters and gatherers were characteristically
nomadic with low population densities. Such societies adapted to the environment and
achieved fairly stable economies.
Four models of south Texas hunter-gatherer settlement patterns have emerged from
recent research. Cultural resource surveys have amassed site data from which three
models of prehistoric settlement pattern (Hester 1971, 1976b, 1981; Shafer and Baxter

RESEARCH MODELS / 15

1975; Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley 1977) have been developed. A fourth model has been
derived from ethnohistoric research (Campbell 1983).
The base-satellite model was developed from the dichotomy of site size and location that
was found within the inland savannah adaptation (Hester 1971, 1976b, 1981). Large base
camps were located on lowland stream terraces, areas which had abundant resources.
From these base camps, task groups established small satellite foraging and hunting
camps, while exploiting the less abundant resources of the uplands. The exact nature and
functioning of both site types in this model might vary regionally with location of specific
food resources and differences in seasonal availability (Hester 1981:126).
Shafer and Baxter (1975) tested Hester's (1971) formulation for Zavala County by
comparing site functions to their locations within physiographic zones. They found that
both large base campsites and small limited-function sites occurred in all physiographic
zones. Therefore, Shafer and Baxter (1975:73) proposed an alternate model for settleÂ­
ment based on the availability of water. According to this model, prehistoric people
established campsites in the uplands while water was available during the wet season and
occupied lowland camps, near perennial streams, during the dry season.
Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley (1977:220) responded to the Choke Canyon Reservoir site data,
especially extended lowland strip sites, by advancing a linear site model. This model uses
the availability of food resources as the basis for proposed camp location choices.
According to the linear site model, aboriginals focused on either an abundant resource
or multiple resources present in the lowlands, but did not repeatedly inhabit a specific
site location. The resulting settlement pattern is composed at linearly extended sites
paralleling stream channels (c/. Hester 1971).
The ethnohistoric model (Campbe111983:351, 353, 356) comes the closest to providing
details about the annual seasonal round of Coahuiltecan groups. The Mariames migrated
from winter grounds along the Guadalupe River to summer prickly pear tracts west of
Corpus Christi Bay. The Pampopas and Aguastayas migrated between the San Antonio
and Nueces rivers. The differences in winter and summer camps, albeit poorly described
apart from the Mariames, and the large geographic scale of nomadic movements suggest
that most of the prehistoric groups of south Texas may have pursued bipolar winter-sumÂ­
mer yearly subsistence rounds, at least in the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods.

METHODS
Historically, the analysis of surface collections and subsurface testing conducted in the
San Miguel region has been frustrated by the extreme disturbance caused by modern land
use and accelerated natural processes and the intensity of relic hunting carried out over
the past five decades (Usrey 1980; Usrey, Grysinski, and Bond 1978). In an attempt to
overcome the difficulties inherent in Phase III testing programs, a variety of methods
were tailored to recover site-specific artifact distributional information. The field techÂ­
niques were also intended to exploit any potential for buried deposits, intact features,
and relatively undisturbed artifact concentrations. All eight sites were tested by
provenienced surface collections. Hand-excavated units augmented surface collection
at 41AT87 and 41MC362 where some cultural material remained buried in small pockets
of sediment. Geomorphic evaluation relied upon shovel probes in shallow sites such as
41MC108 and backhoe trenching of deeper sediments at 41MC362 and 41MC363.
The goal of the testing program was to determine if the distribution of artifacts and
features at any of the prospect sites retained integrity sufficient to recover information
relevant to regional research questions. Past investigations had demonstrated that intact
deposits were prerequisite to a determination of NRHP eligibility.
RESEARCH DESIGN

Four models of site distribution, proposed by various researchers to explain prehistoric
settlement of this upland environment, were applied to the results of the Phase II survey
(Nightengale, et al. 1988; see Archeological Background). The lack of stratigraphic
control and the deflation of the debris of many occupations on a single surface effectively
prohibited refining any of these models to trace changes in settlement preference through
time. Therefore, the testing program was geared toward isolating temporal or functional
components of the site assemblage in the hopes that activity loci could be confidently
identified.
If definable patterns could be related to periods of site occupation, these upland asÂ­

semblages could be compared to those from similar settings in Dimmit, Zavala, Atascosa
and McMullen counties (Hester 1978; Hill and Hester 1971; Montgomery 1978; Shafer
and Baxter 1975; Usrey 1980; Usrey, Grysinski and Bond 1978). Hopefully, the same
data could then be compared to that derived from the Choke Canyon Reservoir project,
a predominantly lowland study area (Hall, Hester and Black 1986) to isolate functional
differences. The Choke Canyon lithic analysis and the cultural assemblage from Lorna
Sandia, a large cemetery site in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley n.d.), provided the
typological and chronological framework for the San Miguel artifact analysis (see also
Cloud 1987).

17

18/ METHODS

The formulation of specific research questions beyond those generalities of settlement
pattern and resource exploitation could only proceed from a secure data base that could,
in turn, be related to specific time periods. The testing program was also intended to
delineate topics where future research at sites meeting NRHP criteria would prove
relevant to regional problems in prehistory.
FIELD METHODS
Surface Collection
Five and two meter interval transects were used to locate burned rock and artifact
concentrations and define site boundaries at all surface-collected sites. The four crew
members walking 5-meter transects pin-flagged all finds according to a color code that
identified specific tool types and burned rock accumulations. Two-meter interval tranÂ­
sects were then walked in areas of concentrated cultural material to further refine the
distribution of artifacts and burned rock. Features were designated if the concentrations
of cultural material appeared intact. Burned rock accumulations that resulted from, or
were radically redeposited by, erosion or modern land use were classified as concentraÂ­
tions rather than features.
Three collection strategies were utilized depending on site size and cultural material
densities. Concentric dog-leash collection circles measuring 1 and 2 meters in diameter
were established over burned rock features at sites 41AT77, 41AT86, 41MCI08, and
41MC360. Artifacts and burned rock from within each circle were mapped, collected,
and bagged separately. A 30 x 70 meter grid of 5 m 2 collection units was placed over
Area A at 41MC360 and specific squares were sampled for artifactual material and
burned rock which was weighed and discarded. Tools and cores were transit-mapped,
flakes and burned rock were collected by square The latter was weighed, described, and
discarded. The third technique was the collection of a sample of debitage and tools along
25-meter long, 2 meter interval straight line transects at 41MC363 and 41MC367.
Subsurface Investigations
Surface collection was supplemented by 25 cm diameter shovel probes at all sites where
the possibility of buried material remained. Shovel probes were dug in arbitrary 10 cm
levels and all matrix was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth.
Shallow excavations were used to further expose features at sites 41AT77, 41MCI08, and
41MC363. This largely consisted of troweling to determine depth and construction
details.
Controlled units were hand-excavated at 41AT87 and 41MC362 to assess the nature of
subsurface deposits. The restricted areal extent of sediments with the potential for
buried cultural material limited the excavations to two 1 x 1 meter units at 41AT87 and
two 1 x 2 and one 1 x 1 meter units at 41MC362. Vertical control consisted of arbitrary

LABORATORYANALYSIS I 19

10 cm levels, measured by stringline and level from the southeast stake. The matrix at
41AT87 was dry-screened through 1/4 in mesh. At 41MC362, the soil was soaked and
then water-screened.
Backhoe trenches were dug at 41MC362, 41MC363, and 41MC367 to more thoroughly
assess the natural and cultural deposition of sites 41MC362 and 41MC363. The results
of the geomorphic analysis are presented in Chapter 4.
Permanent data were established and site maps were drawn at all tested sites. The
locations of features, collection units, backhoe trenches, shovel probes, flake transects,
burned rock concentrations and topographic features were recorded. Specific artifactual
types were plotted by transit and given unique field numbers for later distributional
analysis.
Vertebrate and molluscan fauna were collected where ever possible. Soil samples were
taken from backhoe trenches, shovel probes, and test pits for later analysis.
Black and white prints and color slides were taken at every site to visually document
pertinent information. All field notes and test unit notes were kept on University of Texas
at Austin forms. Transit readings were recorded on forms specifically designed for the
project. Daily journal notes were kept by the project archeologist and assistant project
archeologist.
LABORATORY ANALYSIS

All chipped stone artifacts were analyzed using morphological constructs established in
the Choke Canyon Reservoir project (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986), the same system
used in the earlier survey report (Nightengale et al1988; Cloud 1987). In addition, the
lithic inventory was divided into three subsets for computer-generated distributional
analyses.
1) Discard Class -Artifacts broken during manufacture or use; expended and
rejuvenation pieces; all fragments, manufacturing failures, preforms, core
nuclei and tested cobbles.
2) Diagnostic Class - Artifacts assignable to a specific time period in the south Texas
and neighboring cultural sequences; all projectile points and some distally
beveled tools.
3) Use Class - Functionally specific artifacts that represent tasks carried out on site;
trimmed and utilized flakes, modified sandstone, unifaces, distally bevelled
tools, thick bifaces, certain thin bifaces and core groups 1-5 and 7.
The raw site maps, including artifact, feature and burned rock concentration
provenience,were entered into an in-house software program entitled Transmap (Julien
n.d.a). This program translates stadia readings into x, y and z coordinates. The data file
was then entered into a Minark (Johnson 1988) database with other variables including
site number, artifact number, and artifact category. Subsets of records were formed for
each site. Each subset might contain all specimens from a single artifact category, i.e. all
thick bifaces, or it might contain a specific individual group/form subcategory, i.e. thin

20 I METHODS

biface group/form. Minark subsets were transferred via the program Point Plot program
(Julien n.d.b) to layers within a CAD drawing for overlays onto digitized site maps. Point
Plot converts files of x and y coordinates into a file which can be read by a CAD program
to produce various symbols and colors for mapping. Base maps were derived from 2 foot
contour maps at a scale of 1":500' that had been supplied by the sponsor. Primary datum
was plotted from transit readings and cross referenced with actual elevations. By freezing
or thawing combinations of layers, a visual display of the horizontal distribution of certain
artifacts and combinations of artifacts could be viewed on screen or plotted onto site
maps for assessment. Distribution maps are illustrated for each surface-collected site.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
OF PART OF THE SAN MIGUEL LIGNITE PROSPECT
McMULLEN COUNTY, TEXAS
S. Christopher Caran
INTRODUCTION

During the spring of 1988, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) surÂ­
veyed cultural resources in part of the San Miguel Lignite Prospect, northern McMullen
County, Texas. Archeological sites discovered during this and previous local surveys are
restricted to scattered surface and near-surface occurrences, with no deeply stratified,
multi-component sites known. The seemingly erratic distribution of cultural materials
raised concerns that previously undisclosed buried sites might occur in isolated landscape
settings. In order to address this uncertainty, the present author investigated the QuaterÂ­
nary stratigraphy and geomorphology of the survey area and vicinity. Findings of this
study identify areas of denudation, thick and/or rapid sediment accumulation, and disÂ­
ruptive pedologic processes that may have exhumed, buried, or displaced cultural
resources from their original, anthropogenically defined provenience. These results help
to explain the geographic, stratigraphic, and chronologic distribution of features, arÂ­
tifacts, and other material records of occupation. The reconnaissance area covers
approximately 1.25 square miles (3.2 square km), extending slightly beyond current
boundaries of the prospect.
Geomorphic investigations partly confirm previous reports that little sediment had
accumulated during the Holocene in upland terrains. A significant part of the landscape
has undergone progressive denudation through sheet wash and local rill incision and
gullying. The highest upland surfaces are covered with gravels and have thin soils. These
surfaces are relatively stable but they, too, are essentially free of stratified or buried
archeological sites. However, these uplands were undoubtedly significant lithic procureÂ­
ment areas because of the abundance of siliceous pebbles and cobbles and rare small
boulders. At an intermediate position in the landscape are long, low-relief slopes. The
upper parts of these slopes are mantled with a discontinuous veneer of slope-washed
pebbles and cobbles derived from the upland gravel deposits. Beneath this veneer are
calcareous, gypsiferous mudstones of the Eocene Jackson Group, which are widely
exposed on middle and lower slopes. Soil development is limited and generally superimÂ­
posed directly on the poorly consolidated bedrock. In the eastern part of the
reconnaissance area, mudstones are underlain by calcareous fine-grained sandstones of
the Jackson Group. These sandstones are exposed along Hog Creek and its unnamed
tributaries or lie buried beneath sandy alluvium. All streams throughout the area are

21

22 I GEOMORPHOLOGY

intermittent. Moderately thick, stratified, fluvial deposits are restricted to narrow corÂ­
ridors along major local streams. Surveys and testing to date indicate that the density
and complexity of archeological sites on slopes and along streams are low, and no
extensive mUlti-component sites have been found.
LOCATION AND PHYSIOGRAPHIC SETTING
Current investigations of cultural resources and geomorphology were necessitated by
proposed expansion of the San Miguel lignite mine into northernmost McMullen County.
Tracts covered by this geomorphic reconnaissance include the present archeological
survey area and a portion of the contiguous testing area. The purpose of extending the
geomorphic study from the survey area into part of the testing area is to ensure continuity
of the geomorphic terrains and similarity of the rates and processes of landscape
evolution. Present mine facilities are located in Atascosa County immediately to the
north. Areas to be mined in the future include parts of the channels and watersheds of
La Jarita Creek and one its principal tributaries, Hog Creek. La Jarita Creek, in turn, is
a tributary of San Miguel Creek, part of the Frio River drainage network. Discharge from
all of these streams ultimately reaches the Gulf of Mexico through the Nueces River
(Geological Survey 1985). San Miguel Prospect lies entirely within the South Texas
portion of the Western Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic province (Fenneman 1946),
also known as the Rio Grande Plain land-resource area (Soil Conservation Service 1985a)
and the Nueces Basin geographic region (Ferguson 1986).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Environment
Few published references pertain directly to the environment of the San Miguel Prospect.
Nightengale and others (1988) provided an introduction to the physical, biological, and
cultural resources of this area, including all archeological sites in proximity. Diagnostic
cultural materials range from Paleoindian to Historic, although most of the recovered
artifacts are Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric. A previous archeological survey conÂ­
ducted by Shafer and Baxter (1975) produced a similar range of materials. None of the
diagnostic artifacts were found in a coherent stratigraphic context.
Dittmar and Stevens (1980) described and mapped soils throughout Atascosa County. A
general soils map of McMullen County was prepared and issued by the Soil Conservation
Service (1985b). Regional hydrology, particularly ground- water resources, has been
summarized by Deussen and Dole (1916), Lonsdale (1935), Sundstrom and Follett
(1950), Harris (1965), and Alexander and White (1966). Discussions of central Texas
flood hazards by Baker (1975) and Caran and Baker (1986) are applicable, in part, to the
present study area, as well. Climatic conditions, including factors affecting the occurÂ­
rence of flood-producing rains, were summarized by Russell (1945), Carr (1967), Orton
(1969), Bowmar (1983), Larkin and Bowmar (1983), Caran and Baker (1986), and Slade
(1986). Drought was discussed by Riggio and others (1987).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS I 23

Pre-Quaternary geology of Atascosa and McMullen counties was described andlor
mapped by Deussen (1924), Lonsdale (1935), Sundstrom and Follett (1950), Waters and
others (1955), Harris (1965), Alexander and White (1966), and Brown and Waechter
(1976). Lignite resources and mining at San Miguel and throughout the region were
discussed most recently by Ayers (1986) and Ayers and Kaiser (1986). Lewis (1977)
reviewed local oil production, and McCammon (1942), Pence (1951), and Maxwell (1962)
treated other economic minerals, particularly ceramic clays.
Quaternary Stratigraphy and Geomorphology

For purposes of this discussion, the Quaternary Period is the interval from 1.6 million
years ago to the present, which includes the Pleistocene Epoch, 1.6 million to 10,000years
before present (B.P.), and Holocene Epoch, 10,000 years B.P. to the present (Palmer,
1983). The Holocene Epoch is here informally divided into three equal time intervals,
"early," "middle," and "late," and the "modern" interval roughly corresponding to the
present century. Known human occupation of the San Miguel region on an occasional or
persistent basis spans the past 11,000 years (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986). The present
geomorphic and stratigraphic study emphasizes the period of occupation, although
aspects of pre-Holocene geology are discussed as appropriate.
Although there has been no single, comprehensive review, several investigators have
touched on aspects of the Quaternary geology of this area. Harris (1965) and Alexander
and White (1966) summarized the geology of McMullen and Atascosa counties, respecÂ­
tively, including the general character and distribution of Quaternary deposits. Brown
and Waechter (1976) mapped modern fluvial and fluvial terrace deposits, as well as older
(Tertiary) bedrock units. However, the stratigraphy and chronology of Quaternary
deposits in this area remained poorly known. Caran and Mandel (1988) provided a brief
stratigraphic, chronologic, and paleoenvironmental overview of fluvial systems in the
Texas Coastal Plain. Their investigation emphasized the Colorado River, as have most
other geomorphic studies in this region. The Colorado flows approximately 125 miles
(200 km) northeast of the San Miguel project area, and is much larger than any of the
streams of southern Texas other than the Rio Grande. Development of the Colorado and
other drainages that cross the Balcones Escarpment was strongly influenced by stream
capture, which in turn is related to evolution of the Edwards Aquifer ground-water system
(Woodruff and Abbott 1986). For these reasons, geomorphic and paleoenvironmental
conditions within the Colorado valley provide a general, but imperfect analog of condiÂ­
tions within the San Miguel Creek drainage basin. Sorenson and others (1976), Looney
and Baker (1977), Baker and Penteado-Orellana (1977; 1978), and Frederick (1987)
described fluvial terraces of the Colorado River on the inner Coastal Plains. These
authors employed geomorphic, pedologic, and sedimentologic evidence to infer
paleoclimatic and paleohydrologic conditions. Although these studies identify major
geomorphic processes in the region, all are hampered by limited chronologic control.
A few published studies have produced radiocarbon dates and tephrochronologic, culÂ­
tural, or biostratigraphic evidence useful in establishing chronologies. Izett and Wilcox
(1982) reported an occurrence (their map locality Texas 2) of 620,000 year old Lava Creek

24 I GEOMORPHOLOGY

B volcanic ash in Bastrop CountYJ Texas J in the Colorado River valley (see also Izett,
1981). Caran and Mandel (1988) related this ash deposit to one of the upper terraces of
the Colorado. Although precise stratigraphic relations remain unclear, this site provides
the only "absolute" age datum beyond the range of radiocarbon dating for any Quaternary
deposit or landform in the Gulf Coastal Plains.
Hester (1980)J Bryant and Shafer (1977)J Bryant and Holloway (1985)J and Lundelius
(1986; n.d.) enumerated important archeologic, palynologic, and paleontologic sites, and
ascertained the temporal context of recovered cultural, floral, and faunal materials. No
post-Miocene faunas older than Rancholabrean (Middle to Late Pleistocene) have been
found in the Coastal Plains west of Florida, although an extensive Middle Pleistocene
Irvingtonian fauna was recently discovered in caves of the Balcones fault zone J which
borders the Coastal Plains on the west (Taylor 1982; Holman and Winkler 1987).
Rancholabrean and Holocene faunas are known from a number of sites in the Coastal
Plains (Lundelius n.d.). There are few palynological records from South Texas and the
Coastal Plain in general and none of these are Holocene records (Bryant and Holloway
1985:60, Fig. 1J Table 1). Occupational histories of existing archeological sites disconÂ­
tinuously span the Holocene Epoch to the present (Hester 1980). But to date, there has
been no detailed, chronologically constrained synthesis of Late Pleistocene through
Holocene stratigraphy, geomorphology, and paleoenvironment of the inner Gulf Coastal
Plains or South Texas area.
GEOMORPHOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY

Stratigraphy and geomorphology of the San Miguel Prospect provide indications of
pre-modern environmental conditions and the chronology of Quaternary landscape
evolution. Environmental factors strongly influenced occupation of this areaJ as well as
subsequent preservation and integrity of archeological sites and materials. The varietYJ
intensitYJ and continuity of human activities were controlled, directly or indirectly, by the
limited availability of potable water. Properties of the substrate also were important.
Clay content, in particular, restricted soil drainage and arability. As cultural materials
accumulated they were buried, dispersed, or mixed by a combination of depositional,
erosional, and pedologic processes. The shrink-swell capacity of many of these soils is
extremely high. Resulting pedoturbation tends to reduce stratigraphic continuity and to
disrupt the integrity of buried features, cultural horizons, and activity surfaces. PaleoinÂ­
dian through Historic artifacts are found together on denuded and stable
(nonaggradational) surfaces, in pedoturbated clayey soils, and in fluvial deposits. During
the present and previous surveys and testing programs in the project area, no diagnostic
cultural materials were found in coherent stratigraphic context.
Geomorphic studies at San Miguel involved a variety of field investigations. Landscape
terrains were identified and mapped. Natural outcrops and exposures at a series of
backhoe trenches and archeological test pits were described and sampled. Selected
samples were examined microscopically in the laboratory. These results were suppleÂ­
mented with findings of the present and previous archeological surveys and with
considerable geological data from studies related to lignite mining and resource evaluaÂ­
tion.

GEOMORPHOLOGYAND STRATIGRAPHY / 25

In addition to the present text, tangible products of the geomorphic study include: a map
of geomorphic terrains within the project area; two geologic cross sections through
Quaternary deposits; measured sections and photographs illustrating specific terrains
and geomorphic features; a table summarizing characteristics of local landforms; and a
chronologic reconstruction of landscape evolution. The map indicates the local areal
extent of the terrains, whereas the cross sections illustrate their topographic expression.
The cross sections also indicate the relative degree of erosion and/or deposition in
various landscape settings and the potential for recovery of cultural materials in relation
to burial rates and displacive processes. These figures and tables provide a model of
Quaternary landscape development in the San Miguel project area, and a conceptual
framework for the temporal and spatial distribution of archeological resources.
Geomorphic Terrains of the San Miguel Prospect

The proposed San Miguel project area encompasses several discrete geomorphic terrains
defined on the basis of surface morphology, soil type, internal stratigraphy, active
geomorphic processes, elevation above and distance from principal local streams.
Streamward from the tops of local drainage divides, major elements of the landscape
include: (1) gravel-covered uplands; (2) denuded (sheet washed and gullied) bedrock
slopes, the upper parts of which may be thinly mantled with redeposited gravels; and (3)
riparian corridors, including narrow alluvial flood plains/terraces and active channels of
the principal intermittent streams (Fig. 2). Between the low-relief gravel covered
uplands and the moderately incised meandering channels are rolling slopes that generally
afford exposures of weakly consolidated, calcareous mudstones. Calcareous, fine grained
sandstones crop out locally, particularly along lower Hog Creek in the southeastern part
of the present project area. Soils developed within fluvial and slope-wash deposits across
much of the prospect, but soil profiles are superimposed directly on bedrock in some
areas. Characteristics of the principal local terrains are summarized in Table 1.
GRAVEL-COVERED UPLANDS

Upland surfaces in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the geomorphic
reconnaissance area are covered with calcareous cemented sandy silty gravel 3 to perhaps
10 feet (1 to perhaps 3 meters) thick (Figs. 2-5). Elevations generally exceed 320 feet
(98 meters) and slopes average 28.5 feet per mile (5.4 meters per km), a 0.5 percent grade.
Diagenetic (saturated zone) and/or pedogenic calcification varies from light,
discontinuous coatings on individual gravel particles to discrete interparticle and
laterally linked masses. Calcification corresponds to stages I to III in the carbonate
accumulation index of Machette (1985:Table 1). As a result of partial cementation, the
gravels form a moderately indurated conglomerate.
Gravel within this conglomerate generally ranges from pebble to cobble size with a few
small boulders. All particles are siliceous and the gravel-covered uplands probably were
the principal local sources of lithic materials for projectile points and other artifacts.
Chert is the dominant rock type, although silicified wood and quartzite also are

the survey and testing areas, and were associated with projectile points and other
implements composed of this mineral at one site (see 41MC360). Presumably,
prehistoric inhabitants gathered chalcedony from some or all of the areas where other
siliceous gravels were available, although clasts composed of this mineral appear to be
rare in the project area. Accessible source areas include the local gravel-covered uplands
and deposits of reworked gravels on slopes and along streams, as well as comparable
settings outside the present project area. However, chalcedony is a particularly attractive

and distinctive material that might have been highly prized. For this reason, the
chalcedony found locally may have been traded or preferentially transported from
collecting sites elsewhere. Gravels are found in uplands and, less plentifully, along
drainages throughout the region, particularly southward from La Jarita Creek.
Brown and Waechter (1976) mapped the upland gravel conglomerates as "Quaternary
fluviatile terrace deposits," but it is unlikely these gravel deposits were discretely asÂ­
sociated with the existing drainage system. Instead, they appear to be relicts of an
ancestral stream network predating establishment of the present San Miguel-La Jarita
channel configuration. Evidence for this hypothesis is found in the distribution of
gravels, which are not confined to the modern valleys, but occupy broad, undissected
drainage divides and generally are not contiguous with the terraces of existing streams.
Upland gravels are more often separated from the terraces by a wide denuded bedrock
slope that is the valley wall (Figs. 3 and 5). As a result, upland gravels and stream terraces
of the San Miguel Creek drainage basin do not define a geomorphic continuum in the
sense of the stepped, inset terraces of the Colorado River of Central Texas (see Baker
and Penteado-Orellana 1977). The regional-scale geologic map covering the San Miguel
Prospect (Brown and Waechter 1976) may be slightly misleading in this regard.
Since deposition of the upland gravels, the topography of this area has inverted, such that
former channels are now hill tops. Gravel, the coarsest sediment in the ancestral streams,
was transported in the channel bottoms. These channel bottoms were therefore armored
with siliceous gravel, which was relatively resistant to erosion compared to landforms
lacking this armor. The gravel remained even long after the ancestral streams were
abandoned, whereas the rest of the landscape was preferentially denuded. Eventually,
fluvial gravels occupied high areas in the evolving landscape, completing the cycle of
topographic inversion.
These gravels should not be confused with the Pliocene Uvalde Formation, which is found
on even higher surfaces primarily to the north and west but locally to the south and east,
as well (Brown and Waechter 1976). As used here, the term Uvalde Formation refers to
extensive beds of gravel, high in the landscape, along and downslope from the elevated
Balcones Escarpment. This is the sense in which Hill (1891) introduced the name
"Uvalde deposits". Some later workers, including Byrd (1970), have needlessly
broadened and misapplied Hill's concept. The Uvalde Formation is the probable source
from which upland gravel deposits of the San Miguel Prospect derived. Erosion of the
Uvalde Formation freed these pebbles and cobbles, which were then transported by the
ancestral streams and redeposited as an unnamed, second-generation gravel. It is this
second-generation gravel that forms the conglomerate now found in the highest uplands
of the local landscape.
The conglomerate is likewise subject to erosion at its margins, giving rise to yet a third
generation of gravel deposits on some bedrock slopes and in modern stream channels
(Fig. 3). Composition of the gravel may have changed very little through these repeated
cycles of deposition and erosion. The gravel cap on these uplands makes them relatively
stable, such that they erode more slowly than do contiguous slopes from which the gravel
armor has been largely or completely removed (Figs. 3 and 5). Erosion rates are less than

32/ GEOMORPHOLOGY

the mean rate for all uplands in the San Miguel drainage basin (Table 1). An Aridic
Argiustoll, the Hindes soil series, developed over most of the gravel-covered upland
terrain. The Hindes is characterized by a calcic horizon as well as a mollic epipedon and
an argillic horizon.
Age of the upland gravel deposits and their associated landforms and soils are not well
constrained. These gravels clearly postdate the topographically higher Uvalde FormaÂ­
tion, from which they derived. The Uvalde Formation probably was deposited during the
Pliocene Epoch. In estimating the age of upland gravels in the San Miguel area, sufficient
time must be allowed for inversion of the Uvalde landscape, partial erosion of the Uvalde
Formation itself, and fluvial transport and deposition of the reworked gravels. Similar
processes created the fluvial terraces within the valley of the Colorado River of the inner
Coastal Plains. The sediment composing these deposits derived, in part, from an unÂ­
named formation of possible Pliocene age that is comparable to the Uvalde and occupies
many of the existing drainage divides (Caran and Mandel 1988). Terraces ofthe Colorado
River valley form a nearly continuous topographic series and range in age from Middle(?)
Pleistocene to the present. By analogy to this terrace sequence, gravel deposits in the
uplands of the San Miguel project area are most like the Sixth Street Terrace of the
Colorado, which may have been deposited during the Late Pleistocene (see Frederick
1987). Among the similarities are the degree of calcification and topographic relief (that
is, the amount of subsequent downcutting).
Calcification of the gravels began soon after deposition. Initial cementation probably
resulted from diagenesis, as solute-enriched interflow permeated these porous channel
deposits. The original composition of gravels deposited in this area may have included
some litho clasts of Lower Cretaceous limestone eroded from extensive outcrops along
the Balcones Escarpment and throughout the Edwards Plateau region of Central Texas.
Subsequent leaching would have removed these relatively soluble components, providing
some of the calcium carbonate now cementing the more resistant siliceous gravels.
However, most or all of the gravel probably derived from the Uvalde Formation, from
which most limestone clasts had already been leached. Therefore, the contribution of
carbonate from dissolution of lithoclasts alone must have been relatively small.
Another factor affecting carbonate accumulation was the low permeability of Eocene
mudstones underlying the relict stream gravels. Water infiltrating through the gravel was
likely to "perch" along the permeability barrier, leaching some carbonate from the
subjacent calcareous mudstones. Increasing solute load and prolonged contact of shallow
ground water with gravels immediately overlying the barrier enhanced opportunities for
precipitation of carbonate cement. But as the landscape was gradually dissected, the
alluvial aquifer began to drain. When the gravels were no longer water saturated,
calcification continued through pedogenesis and eventually attained stage III.
Development rates for calcic and petro calcic horizons in this region are poorly underÂ­
stood, although they may have exceeded those in most of the areas where carbonate
accumulation has been semi-quantified (see Gile 1975; Machette 1985; and McFadden
and Tinsley 1985). In general, these and similar studies have been conducted in the desert
Southwest, where the climate is xeric and soil parent materials are noncalcareous and

GEOMORPHOLOGYAND STRATIGRAPHY I 33

very well drained. Under such conditions, stage III carbonate accumulation requires a
minimum of 100,000 years. In contrast, significant sources of calcium carbonate were
available in the semi-arid San Miguel Prospect where mudstones inhibit soil drainage.
Stage III carbonate accumulation in this area might have required 30,000 to 50,000 years
or more. Blum (1987) presented data from an alluvial setting comparable to that of the
San Miguel area, indicating development of stage III calcic horizons in less than 33,000
years and stage II in as little as 5,500 years. This rough chronology is based on a limited
suite of radiocarbon age determinations, including analysis of a carbonate nodule, the
validity of which was acknowledged to be uncertain. The coarse-grained alluvial pare,nt
materials of Blum's study area, the upperPedernales River valley of Central Texas, are
high in carbonates. Pedogenic accumulation rates probably were greater along the
Pedernales than those at San Miguel, but do serve as a basis for comparison.
Denudation rates provide another means for inferring the minimum age of deposits at a
given position in the landscape. Using the figure for total annual erosion in Table 1, a
long- term mean denudation rate can be calculated. Total annual erosion, including
eolian deflation, stream incision, and sheet and rill erosion, is approximately 1.63 tons
per acre (3.65 megagrams per square hectometer). If sediment density is 75 pounds per
cubic foot (Table 1, footnote c), denudation is 0.001 foot per year (0.34 millimeters per
year), a conservative estimate. At present, San Miguel Creek lies 55 feet (16.8 meters)
below the gravel-covered uplands, which have a minimum elevation of 320 feet (97.6
meters). At least 55,000 years of erosion would have been required to create the present
landscape at a mean rate of 0.001 feet per year (0.34 millimeters per year). Therefore,
gravel composing the upland conglomerate would have been deposited more than 55,000
years ago. The rate of denudation undoubtedly varied through time, perhaps by as much
as an order of magnitude. Uncertainty regarding the long-term erosion rate limits the
reliability of this approach but there is general agreement among estimates of the age of
the upland gravels based on carbonate accumulation, denudation, and analogy to the
Colorado River terrace sequence. In the absence of other chronologic indicators, these
convergent estimates establish the time of deposition as Late Pleistocene (Early? to
Middle Wisconsin).

DENUDED BEDROCK SLOPES
The Eocene Jackson Group is exposed throughout the project area or lies at shallow
depths beneath Pleistocene and Holocene alluvium and slope-wash deposits (Brown and
Waechter 1976). Locally, the Jackson Group consists of gypsiferous lagoonal mudstones
except in the eastern part of the reconnaissance area where calcareous sandstones,
representing the landward margin of an Eocene barrier-island complex, are exposed (Fig.
2). Within the lower Jackson Group, a lignite seam here 11 to 15 feet (3.4 to 4.6 meters)
thick lies at depths accessible through surface mining (Ayers 1986). Lignite has been
mined at San Miguel since 1980.
Channel incision, gullying, and sheet and rill erosion have exhumed the Eocene strata,
exposing silty clayey mudstones and fine-grained sandstones. The resulting slopes are
concave with gradients averaging 293 feet per mile (55.5 meters per kilometer), corÂ­

38 I GEOMORPHOLOGY

occurrences would be rare, whereas kitchen debris would generally be charred by fire or
slaked by boiling. However, Hester and Hill (1975) found no evidence of heat damage
to mollusk shells experimentally subjected to boiling. Breakage patterns may afford
another means of distinguishing animal predation from human consumption. RoadrunÂ­
ners break snail shells into numerous fragments but Hester (1975) and Hester and Hill
(1975) found that extraction of snails from their shells after cooking resulted in little
breakage.
Chronology of landform development in the denuded bedrock terrain is poorly conÂ­
strained. There are few deposits, and soils developed directly on bedrock at various times
in different areas. The existing soils postdate much of the denudation characterizing this
terrain. Stage II carbonate accumulation indicates pedogenesis may have begun in the
mid-Holocene or earlier. Denudation rates provide a somewhat greater estimate of age.
Measuring from the lowest elevation of the gravel-covered uplands, 320 feet (97.6
meters), to the highest elevation of most of the riparian corridor, 300 feet (91.5 meters),
the denuded bedrock terrain was created by 20 feet (6.1 meters) of vertical erosion. This
would have required at least 20,000 years at a mean rate 0.001 feet per year (0.34
millimeters per year). In fact, any estimate between perhaps 5,000 and 50,000 years
would be consistent with the limited chronologic data from other local terrains, as
discussed below.
RIPARIAN CORRIDORS

The San Miguel project area is drained by several small intermittent streams of which La
Jarita and Hog Creeks are the largest (Fig. 2). These trunk streams and their unnamed
tributaries have shallow channels, narrow flood plains, and low poorly defined terraces.
The Eocene bedrock of this region is relatively resistant to stream erosion. Normalized
stream and gully erosion throughout the San Miguel Creek drainage basin is 0.15 tons
per acre (0.34 megagrams per square hectometer), compared to a statewide average of
0.58 tons per acre (1.30 megagrams per square kilometer). Channel gradients are very
low, approximately 13.7 feet per mile (2.6 meters per kilometer), which is equivalent to
a slope of less than 0.3 percent. Fluvial deposits are thin and some are overgrown with
riparian woodlands, affording few outcrops (Fig. 10). For this reason, a backhoe was used
to expose the soils and sediments at selected locations within this terrain. Archeological
test pits also were examined.
Site 41MC362, Test Pit 1

At archeological site 41MC362, three test pits (numbers 1-3) and two backhoe trenches
(numbers 3 and 4) were excavated on a low natural levee within the flood plain/terrace
of La Jarita Creek. Two additional trenches (numbers 1 and 2) were emplaced nearby.
Gullies cut part way through the levee, which is less than 3 feet (1 meter) higher than
adjacent portions of the flood plain. Locally, the stream has cut a steep walled channel
10 to 13 feet (3 to 4 meters) deep through sandy alluvium and Eocene bedrock bearing
a Quaternary pedogenic overprint. This reach of the active channel is separated from
the levee by a shallow swale. This swale is a relict chute channel, now mostly infilled with

GEOMORPHOLOGYAND STRATIGRAPHY I 41

stratigraphic unit through deliberate or incidental burial, or, more likely, were incorÂ­
porated at the time of deposition. There may have been some redistribution of these
materials through local transport or soil movement. Depositional structures consist of
faint low-angle tabular cross beds, which were partly masked by overprinted soil strucÂ­
tures. Soil structure is very weak prismatic or coarse angular blocky, with a few root
traces throughout. Some root traces have a thin interior coating of calcium carbonate.
The top of Unit 2 was eroded and thickness of the unit is variable, ranging from 8.9 to
12.6 inches (22.5 to 32 cm). Its lower boundary is also an erosional, stratigraphic contact,
now blurred to a clear, smooth transition zone by weak soil development. Unit 2 is an
overbank deposit partly modified by anthropogenic(?) and pedogenic processes.
On the basis of soil taxonomy alone, some observers might describe Units 1 and 2 as a
single soil, consisting of a mollic epipedon (A horizon = Unit 1) over a parent material
only slightly altered by pedogenic processes (C horizon = Unit 2). Indeed, these are
among the principal properties of a Haplustoll, and because Unit 1 is clearly aggradaÂ­
tional, the soil would be classified as a Cumulic Haplustoll. The adem series is a soil of
this type that occupies flood plains and low terraces within the project area. Whereas
the upper part of the sedimentary section exposed in Test Pit 1 meets the criteria for
assignment to the adem series, it would be misleading to do so without comment. Units
1 and 2 are genetically discrete, resulting from depositional events separated in time.
Pedogenesis had already begun to modify Unit 2 prior to erosion of its upper surface and
subsequent deposition of sediment composing Unit 1. The pedogenic history of Unit 1
has had little if any discernable effect on underlying Unit 2. Therefore, referral of the
two units to a single soil, while not strictly incorrect, is an oversimplification. It would
be more accurate to identify Unit 2 as a buried incipient soil that was truncated and
overlain by sediment of Unit 1. Unit 1 contains yet another soil in an even more
fundamental stage of development. This interpretation is consistent with the sequence
of geomorphic events and provides a much clearer framework for characterizing the
distribution of cultural materials.
The lower part of the section at Test Pit 1 includes two stratigraphic units, numbers 3 and
4. Unit 3 is a dark gray (10YR4/1), silty, clayey, fine sand with rare medium sand. No
depositional structures are evident. Soil structure is weak coarse prismatic with a few
root traces throughout. Granule- to pebble-size, white, firm, calcareous rhizoconcreÂ­
tions increase in abundance downward. The lower boundary appears to be an erosional
contact, now blurred by weak soil development to a clear, smooth, but somewhat inconÂ­
spicuous transition zone. Unit 3 is a truncated buried soil composed of overbank and/or
slope-wash deposits. The parent material consists primarily of pedosediment derived
through erosion of the subjacent buried soil, but was subsequently modified by additional
pedogenesis.
Unit 4 is a dark gray (10YR4/1), very silty, clayey, very fine sand with rare medium sand.
Depositional structures are absent. Soil structure is moderate coarse prismatic with root
traces and carbonized roots. Pebble-size, white, firm-to-hard, calcareous rhizoconcreÂ­
tions are found throughout, and moderately thick calcans coat ped faces and root traces
incompletely. Calcium carbonate also fills desiccation cracks, some of which are as much
as 0.2 inch (0.5 cm) wide at the base of the exposure (similar filled cracks in the denuded

bedrock terrain are shown in Fig. 7). Unit 4 is a truncated buried soil developed directly
on Eocene Jackson Group mudstone. This soil contains a small amount of medium sand
from former overlying alluvial deposits, which was admixed through pedoturbation from
repeated shrinking and swelling.
The ages of these stratigraphic units and their respective soils are not well defined. None
of the soils are strongly developed, although carbonate accumulation in Units 3 and 4
attained stage II. This indicates that individual soil forming episodes may have lasted no
more than 5,500 years, probably much less in Units 1 and 2. Development of these soils
was essentially arrested when they were truncated and buried, and the pedogenic record
is therefore incomplete. Although cultural materials were found at the surface and
throughout Unit 2, no diagnostic artifacts or other chronologic indicators were recovered
in place. In nearby Test Pit 2, a small sample of charcoal and its surrounding soil was
collected from amid a concentration of burned rock. The burned rock was enclosed in
the upper part of a layer of silty, clayey, fine sand that is demonstrably correlative with
stratigraphic Unit 2. The un calibrated radiocarbon age of this sample is 1560 Â± 220 years
(TX6095). Soil development in this unit is particularly weak, which probably indicates
that little organic matter was added following deposition of the parent materials.
Radiocarbon age of the sample is thus assumed to represent or at least approximate the
age of the deposit.
A second radiocarbon sample was collected from an intact hearth at site 41MC379
approximately 1.25 miles (2.0 km) upstream from site 41MC362 (see Appendix 1).
Charcoal from the hearth at 41MC379 yielded an uncalibrated radiocarbon age of 970 Â±
50 years (TX6018). The hearth was 5.9 inches (15 cm) below ground, but 3.9 to 5.9 inches
(10 to 15 cm) of sediment had apparently been removed from the overlying surface by
recent erosion. Deposits containing the hearth are overbank sediments of a poorly
defined fill terrace 4.9 to 5.7 feet (1.5 to 1.75 meters) above the local channel bottom.
Soil development is weak. The stratigraphic and geomorphic settings from which
radiocarbon samples were collected at sites 41MC379 and 41MC362 are similar.
At site 41MC379, where overbank deposition was relatively continuous, the rate of net
aggradation was approximately 1.0 foot (0.3 meters) per 1,000 years. If this rate were
also applicable at site 41MC362, the entire 6.2 foot (1.9 meter) section within the swale
might have been deposited over about 6,000 years. However, aggradation within the
flood channel at site 41MC362 was probably more rapid. Therefore, maximum age of the
local section may be significantly less than 6,000 years. This conclusion is consistent with
the fact that there was stage II carbonate accumulation in paleosols underlying the
overbank deposits exposed in Test Pit 1. The soil in Unit 3 may have been as little as
5,500 years old. Determination of the age of this soil would establish the maximum age
of the overlying alluvium, as well. The apparent close agreement of the ages inferred by
extrapolating carbonate accumulation and sediment deposition rates may be fortuitous,
but the age of alluvium along La Jarita Creek and presumably other drainages in the
project area is very likely Holocene, possibly middle Holocene to present. The absence
of in situ Paleoindian and Early Archaic artifacts, remains of Rancholabrean fauna, or
other contraindicators also attests to this interpretation but is not, in itself, conclusive.

Unit 2 is a variegated, clayey, fine sand with uncommon coarse sand (quartz, chert, and
fossil wood) and angular to subrounded, pebble-size sandstone lithoclasts, interbedded
with tongues of fine sand containing variable but locally abundant concentrations of
angular, pebble- to cobble-size lithoclasts of sandstone. Thickness of the tongues ranges
from 3.9 to 7.9 inches (10 to 20 cm) in this section but is highly variable from trench to
trench. Individual tongues are laterally discontinuous (Fig. 5). Below 15.7 inches (40
cm) depth, there is gypsum efflorescence throughout, and small crystals of selenite
formed within the tongues of gravelly sand. Gypsum crystallization occurs at and below
the fluctuating water table. The local section was water-saturated below 4.8 feet (1.47
meters) in depth on the day of excavation (4 May, 1988). Thin, discontinuous mangans
coat individual particles within the zone of saturation. Color varies from white (lOYR8/2)
to very pale brown (10YR8/4) above 4.8 feet (1.47 meters) depth, to reddish brown
(5YR5/4) with black to purple (no Munsell equivalent) mangans below. The lower
boundary of Unit 2 is an abrupt, wavy, erosional stratigraphic contact. Unit 2 consists of
flood-channel deposits intercalated with tongues of slope-washed sediment, both of
which are undergoing diagenesis (gypsification). Subjacent Unit 3 is thin-bedded, calÂ­
careous, very fine sandstone, the subcrop equivalent of Eocene bedrock cropping out in
the adjacent valley wall (Figs. 2 and 13).
Chronologic control within the representative section, and in this part of the riparian
corridor in general, is poor. Soil development is very weak, indicating rapid and/or recent
deposition of sediment. No cultural resources and no material suitable for radiocarbon
dating were found in place. Assuming that the inferred rate of overbank deposition at
site 41MC379, approximately 1.0 foot (0.3 meters) per 1,000 years, is applicable here, the
entire 5.1 feet (1.57 meters) sedimentary section at site 41MC363 might have been
deposited over about 5,000 years. However, aggradation at site 41MC363 probably was
more rapid, because sediment was transported both down the channel duririg floods and
toward the channel, by slope wash, during periods of relatively low flow within the
channel itself. Therefore, maximum age of this section may be less than 5,000 years. This
conclusion is consistent with the fact that soil development is minimal. Two soil series
are commonly recognized in riparian corridors of this area, the Odem series on flood
plains and low fill terraces and the Sinton series along channels and flood plains. Profiles
at this site are more like the Odem series than the Sinton, but the presence of gypsum
may necessitate some other series designation. Both the Odem and Sinton soils are
Cumulic Haplustolls, indicating rapid aggradation and limited pedogenic modification
of parent materials.
LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AND ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

Current investigations in the area of proposed lignite mining for the San Miguel project
have disclosed evidence pertaining to landscape evolution and paleoenvironment. ArÂ­
cheological studies provided part of the chronologie framework upon which stratigraphic
and pedogenic data have been assembled. These findings permit three-dimensional
modeling of the distribution of possible artifact-bearing strata (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). AddiÂ­
tional radiocarbon dates would serve to better constrain this model.

LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AND ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS / 49

Table 2 summarizes significant geomorphic events and thresholds in Quaternary
landscape development in the San Miguel area. The highest and oldest geomorphic
surface is the gravel-covered upland, a stable to slowly degrading fill-terrace remnant
generally between 320 and 330 feet (98 and 101 meters) elevation. Carbonate cementaÂ­
tion of the gravels composing this terrace has attained stages II to III, indicating the
gravels were deposited more than 30,000 years before present. The present channel of
San Miguel Creek is approximately 55 feet (16.8 meters) below the gravel-covered
uplands, which would have required 55,000 years of denudation at the modern rate. From
these lines of evidence, the gravels appear to have been deposited during the Late
Pleistocene, probably during the Early? to Middle Wisconsin, 79,000 to 35,000 years
before present (see Quaternary glacial chronology of Richmond and Fullerton 1987).
The relict terrace is related to an undescribed ancestral drainage system and is not
discretely associated with the extant San Miguel-La Jarita channel network.
Most of the history of the La Jarita Creek drainage basin is dominated by downcutting.
Flood plain/terrace terrains of the principal streams are inset at least 20 feet (6.1 meters)
below the base of the gravel-covered uplands. Assuming the conservative estimated rate
of modern denudation, 0.001 foot per year (0.34 millimeters per year), downcutting has
continued for approximately 20,000 years. Soil development on the denuded bedrock
slopes is generally weak but results in stage II carbonate accumulation locally, requiring
at least 5,500 years of relative stability on some slopes. These estimates are compatible
with those based on evidence from other terrains in this project area.
Within the riparian corridor, fluvial cutting and filling are codominant. A chute channel
carved by flood waters at site 41MC362 is now partly filled with 6.2 feet (1.9 meters) of
channel deposits. Intercalated flood-channel and slope-wash deposits at site 41MC363
are 5.1 feet (1.57 meters) thick. Two radiocarbon dates indicate the local minimum rate
of overbank deposition was 1.0 foot (0.3 meter) per 1,000 years. Net channel aggradation
in these settings should exceed the rate of overbank deposition, for which the
stratigraphic record is generally incomplete. Therefore, the age of fluvial deposits at sites
41MC362 and 41MC363 may be less than 5,000 to 6,000 years. Further refinement of
aggradational rates is not possible because no diagnostic cultural materials were
recovered in correct stratigraphic context. However, the estimated mid- to late Holocene
age of alluvium is compatible with available pedogenic chronologies. Overbank deposits
at site 41MC362 incorporate a mixed suite of Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric cultural
materials, and overlie paleosols that attained stage II carbonate accumulation. The
overbank deposits may therefore postdate 5,500 years B.P., but could be as much as 1,000
to 2,000 years older.
Soils of both the denuded bedrock slopes and riparian corridors are vertisols that have
undergone considerable pedoturbation. This process was responsible in part for the
mixed stratigraphic provenience of artifacts. Additional factors that disturbed cultural
contexts include erosion and transport of archeological materials by sheet flow and
streams. At site 41MC362, artifacts are contained in cross-bedded silty clayey fine sands,
along with pebble-size mudstone lithoc1asts and cobble-size burned rock. This material
was transported and deposited by flood waters, although it may have been entrained very
nearby, possibly within the site.

LANDSC4.PE EVOLUTION AND ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPliCATIONS I 51

Figures 2, 3, and 5 present a model of the probable distribution of cultural materials in
relation to geomorphic processes and terrains. On both the gravel-covered uplands and
denuded bedrock slopes, cultural materials should be restricted to the surface and very
shallow subsurface at less than 1 foot (0.3 meter) depth. Isolated artifacts might be found
at slightly greater depth if they were washed into shrinkage cracks in the denuded bedrock
terrain, but such occurrences would be rare and proveniences would clearly be mixed. In
the riparian corridor, burial potential is high on the flood plains/terraces, low in the
channels. Extensive testing failed to disclose a single deeply stratified site with diagnostic
cultural materials in appropriate context. As on the denuded bedrock slopes, most of the
riparian corridor is underlain by Eocene mudstones capped by vertisols. The two most
likely areas for discovering intact buried cultural features and artifacts in correct
stratigraphic context are areas of overbank deposition, such as site 41MC362, and areas
where fluvial sediments overlie sandstones, which are not subject to shrinkage and
swelling, such as site 41MC363. Failure to recover intact features or stratified material
records from these sites probably reflects the impermanence of occupation and activity
areas in this relatively unstable terrain, which is subject to episodic flooding. The
probability that additional testing would disclose such records is very low although
isolated areas of prolonged or repeated occupation might be found if the intensity of
testing were increased dramatically.

In general, the probability of cultural-material recovery would increase downstream
because of the increased width of the flood plain. Individual flood events are less likely
to disturb a given site if the flow is not confined to a single, narrow watercourse. At the
same time, even wide flood plains are subject to occasional, low velocity overbank
discharge, which would ensure burial and thus protection of cultural materials without
significant displacement.

ARTIFACTS
LITHIC ARTIFACTS

The lithic materials recovered during this phase of work in the San Miguel Lignite
Prospect have been classified according to a morphological system originally devised for
the Choke Canyon Project (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:249-386; Hall, Hester, and
Black 1986:231-334). Previously, Cloud (1987) and Nightengale et al. (1988) have used
the Choke Canyon system to classify artifacts recovered during the survey phase of the
San Miguel project. The Choke Canyon Project included portions of Live Oak and
McMullen counties, while the San Miguel Lignite Prospect extends into McMullen and
Atascosa counties. By using the established Choke Canyon morphological system, lithic
comparisons between regions are possible. Additional comments will be made based on
recent analysis of the Loma Sandia site (41LK28) located in Live Oak County (Highley
n.d.); this analysis, to a great extent, also relied on the Choke Canyon classificatory
system.
The lithic analysis section of this report presents the morphological system and defines
the various categories. Totals of groups and forms for the entire lithic assemblage are
included in this section. To supplement the text, Table 3 provides totals of groups and
forms for each site and totals of groups and forms for the entire assemblage. A more
detailed analysis of the lithics from individual sites is presented in the chapter, Site
Descriptions. The more indepth analysis includes descriptive data, chronological imÂ­
plications, and regional comparitive informationÂ· for projectile points, distally beveled
tools, and other diagnostic artifacts.
The lithic materials were organized into the following main categories: chipped stone
artifacts (cores, thick bifaces, thin bifaces, distally beveled tools, unifaces, trimmed
flakes, utilized debitage, rejuvenation flakes, and debitage), hammerstones, and ground
stone tools. Occasionally, artifacts from the San Miguel collection did not fit within the
Choke Canyon system; therefore, additional groupings were devised when needed
(Cloud 1987:32; Nightengale et al. 1988:71). It should also be noted that not all groups
and subgroups (forms) within these categories were recognized in the sample of artifacts
collected during this phase of the San Miguel project.

CORES (911 specimens)

Cores are defined as stream-rolled cobbles or large, thick flakes from which flakes have
been struck to either: 1) test the quality of the material; 2) to produce flakes that could
then be shaped into tools or used "as is"; or 3) to reduce the cobble into a finished tool
form (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:54; Black and McGraw 1985:61). Using the Choke
Canyon method (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:250-266), the cores were grouped into the
following categories based on the direction(s) from which flakes were removed, platform
preparation, platform morphology, size, shape, and degree of reduction.
Group 1. Natural Platform
Group 2. Bidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms
Group 3. Multidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms, Single and Multiple
Facets
Group 4. Unidirectional, Prepared Platform, Single Facet
Group 5. Multidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms, Single Facet
Group 6. Core Nuclei
Group 7. Flat, Circular to Elliptical in Outline, Unifacially Cortex Covered
Group 8. Tested Cobbles
Group 9. Core Fragments
Group 10.Unmodified Cobbles
Groups 1 through 5 were divided into Forms 1 and 2, with Form 2 representing possible
tools. Examples of the various core groups (excluding Groups 9 and 10) are illustrated
in Figures 15-18. For the 911 cores, the following materials were used: chert (91%),
palmwood (4%), silicified wood (2%), silicious quartzite (1 %), chalcedony (1 %), and
quartzite (1%).
Group 1. Natural Platform (26 specimens). Group 1 cores are cortex- covered
cobbles from which flakes were removed using natural platforms. Flake scars
generally occur along one end or edge (Fig. 15a,b). Because so few flakes were
removed, this category is not subdivided according to direction of flake
removal. Most specimens retain 80-95% of the cortex. Material includes chert
(73%), palmwood (11 %), siliceous quartzite (8%), silicified wood (4%), and
chalcedony (4%).
Group 2. Bidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms (131 specimens). Group 2
cores are cobbles that have been flaked bidirectionally at one end or along one
edge (Fig. 15c,d). Initial flakes were removed by striking natural platforms and
the resulting flake scars were then used as platforms for subsequent flake
removals. Cortex covers the side or edge opposite the flaked end. Material
includes chert (93%), silicified wood (4%), palmwood (2%), and siliceous
quartzite (1% ).
Group 3. Multidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms, Single and Multiple
Facets (112 specimens). Group 3 cores have had flakes removed multidirecÂ­

60/ ARTIFACTS

tionally using both natural and prepared platforms with single and multiple
facets (Fig. 16a,b). This category primarily consists of cobbles, but may also
include large, thick flakes derived from cobbles. Material includes chert
(92%), palmwood (5%), silicified wood (2%), and siliceous quartzite (1%).
Group 4. Unidirectional, Prepared Platform, Single Facet (45 specimens). Group 4
cores generally represent split cobbles; the resulting surface served as a
prepared, single facet platform from which flakes were removed unidirectionÂ­
ally (generally perpendicular to the platform; see Fig. 16c,d). Large flakes that
were chipped unidirectionally are also included in this category. Material
types include chert (87%), palmwood (7%), silicified wood (4%), and chalÂ­
cedony (2%).
Group 5. Multidirectional, Natural and Prepared Platforms, Single Facet (76
specimens). Group 5 cores have had flakes removed multidirectionally from
natural and single facet prepared platforms (Fig. 17a,b). Material types inÂ­
clude chert (94%), palmwood (5%), and silicified wood (1%).
Group 6. Core Nuclei (201 specimens). Group 6 consists of exhausted cores that have
been reduced to the extent that additional flake removal would be impractical
or impossible. These specimens are smaller than other core group specimens
and generally retain little or no cortex (Fig. 17c,d). Multidirectional flake scars
indicate both cortex and prepared platforms with single and multiple facets.
Materials include chert (93%), palmwood (5%), siliceous quartzite (1%), and
chalcedony (1 % ).
Group 7. Flat, Circular to Elliptical in Outline, Unifacially Cortex Covered (28
specimens). In outline, Group 7 cores are circular to elliptical (Fig. 18a,b );
they are generally biconvex in cross section. Most specimens retain cortex over
most of one face while the opposite face is covered with scars of flakes struck
from cortex platforms. These specimens are portions of split cobbles or large
flakes derived from cobbles. All of the specimens are chert (100%).
Group 8. Tested Cobbles (44 specimens). Group 8 specimens are cortex- covered
cobbles from which only one to four flakes have been removed, presumably to
test the quality of the material (Fig. 18c,d). Materials include chert (73%),
silicified wood (11 %), palmwood (9%), siliceous quartzite (5%), and quartzite
(2%).
Group 9. Core Fragments (237 specimens). This category consists of unclassifiable
core fragments which probably represent shattered cores and core trimmings
resulting from platform preparation and general shaping. Metric attributes and
illustrations are not provided for these specimens. Materials include chert
(97%), palmwood (2%), and chalcedony (1%).
Group 10. Unmodified Cobbles (11 specimens). This group consists of unmodified,
cortex-covered cobbles. Although unmodified, these specimens are believed
to represent raw material intended for reduction. Most specimens appear to
be chert. These specimens are not illustrated. Materials include chert (37%),
quartzite (36%), palmwood (9%), silicious quartzite (9%), and silicified wood
(9%).

64/ ARTIFACTS

THICK BIFACES (150 specimens)
As originally defined by Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:266), this category consists of

percussion-flaked bifaces measuring 1.3 cm or more in thickness and exhibiting 10-30
flake scars. Forms and wear patterns are not suggestive of function (ibid.). The majority
of the specimens represent manufacturing failures or rejects as evidenced by the presence
of thick knots which could not be removed. Fragmented specimens probably represent
bifaces broken during the manufacturing process. Many specimens retain cortex on one
or both faces; the amount of cortex can range from small patches to almost 80%. Nine
morphological groups were established.
Group 1. Large, Crudely Flaked Oval to Elliptical
Group 2. Elliptical
Group 3. Oval to Subcircular
Group 4. Circular to Subcircular
Group 5. Triangular
Group 6. Fragments with Pointed Ends
Form 1. Elongate
Form 2. Triangular
Group 7. Fragments with Rounded Ends
Form 1. Fragments of Subcircular and Oval Bifaces
Form 2. Large, Broad, Thin Fragments
Form 3. Elliptical
Form 4. Cortex Striking Platform
Group 8. Odd and Miscellaneous
Form 1. Whole
Form 2. Fragmentary
Group 9. Lateral and Medial Fragments
Table 4 provides metric data in centimeters and raw material type for Groups 1 to 5 and
Group 8, Form 1. Examples of thick bifaces (excluding Group 9) are illustrated in Figures
19 and 20.
Group 1. Large, Crudely Flaked Oval to Elliptical (2 specimens). Group 1 thick
bifaces, oval to elliptical in outline (Fig. 19a,b), are generally the largest and
most crudely flaked specimens classified as thick bifaces. Both natural and
prepared platforms were utilized as flakes were removed to initiate thinning
and shaping of the specimen. Most specimens retain a thick ridge or knot on
one or both face(s) which could not be removed. Edges are very sinuous. Most
specimens retain patches of cortex and are biconvex in cross section.
Group 2. Elliptical (12 specimens). Group 2 specimens are somewhat smaller and
more distinctly elliptical than Group 1 thick bifaces (Fig. 19c,d). Edges vary
from slightly sinuous to smooth and straight. Most specimens are biconvex in
cross section, although a few tend to be plano-convex in cross section. Patches
of cortex are present on many of the specimens.

Group 3. Oval to Sub circular (9 specimens). Group 3 thick bifaces are oval to
subcircular in outline (Fig. 1ge,f). Edges are generally smooth and straight,
although a few specimens are more irregular.
Group 4. Circular to Sub circular (7 specimens). Group 4 thick bifaces are circular
to subcircular in outline (Fig. 20a). Edges vary from irregular to fairly smooth
and straight. Cross sections are generally biconvex. Many specimens retain
patches of cortex.
Group 5. Triangular (2 specimens). This category consists of triangular thick bifaces
(Fig. 20b). Edges are sinuous to straight; cross sections are generally biconvex.
Many specimens retain patches of cortex.
Group 6. Fragments with Pointed Ends (23 specimens). These pointed fragments are
probably portions of Group 2 (elliptical) and Group 5 (triangular) thick
bifaces. Based on outline, this group is subdivided into two forms (Fig. 20c,d):
Form 1. Elongate (15 specimens).
Form 2. Triangular (8 specimens).
Group 7. Fragments with Rounded Ends (51 specimens). These thick biface fragÂ­
ments with rounded ends (Fig. 20e-h) are fragments of Group 2 (elliptical) and
Group 3 (oval to sub circular ) bifaces. This group is subdivided into four forms:
Form 1. Fragments of Sub circular and Oval Bifaces (14 specimens).
Form 2. Large, Broad, Thin Fragments (4 specimens).
Form 3. Elliptical (27 specimens).
Form 4. Remnant Cortex Striking Platform (6 specimens).
Group 8. Odd and Miscellaneous (4 specimens). Group 8 specimens are miscelÂ­
laneous thick bifaces with shapes that do not conform to previously defined
morphological groups (Fig. 20i). They are divided into two forms after
Nightengale et al. (1988:80):
Form 1. Whole (1 specimen).
Form 2. Fragmentary (3 specimens).
Group 9. Lateral and Medial Fragments (40 specimens). This category consists of
lateral and medial fragments of thick bifaces.
THIN BIFACES (406 specimens)

Thin bifaces measure less than 1.3 cm in thickness, have straight, smooth edges, and have
been shaped into finished or near-finished form by pressure flaking. Cortex is seldom
present on these specimens. Thin bifaces are divided into groups and forms based on
morphological characteristics (i.e., size and outline). Groups 1 through 10 were estabÂ­
lished by Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:278, 282); Groups 11 and 12 were added by Cloud
(1987: 46) and Nightengale et al. (1988:80). Group 11 included lanceolate shapes and
fragments, such as Angostura and Plainview forms (ibid.); however, a possible Angostura
point was classified by Hall, Black, and Graves (1982: 284, 288) as Group 1, Form 2. For
the present report, the author has chosen to eliminate Group 11 and will classify
lanceolate forms according to Hall, Black, and Graves (1982). It should also be noted
that Group 12 (Irregular Shapes) was not needed for this analysis.

Functional categories represented by these specimens include dart points, arrow points,
knives, and perforators. Preforms and manufacturing failures of these tool forms are also
present. When appropriate, established type names for the projectile points will be
assigned and used within the discussion of the various types. Provenience, metric data
in centimeters, and raw material types for selected thin bifaces are provided in Table 5.
Table 6 shows the distribution of projectile points among the sites. Discussion of
chronological placement and geographical distribution of the various point forms is
provided in the artifact analysis for each site (see Site Analysis).
Group 1. Stemmed (41 specimens).
Form 1. Large with Straight Stems (4 specimens). This category consists of large
stemmed dart points with straight or parallel stem edges (Fig. 21a-d). One
specimen was typed as a MaThiss point; the other specimens could not be
classified. It is noted here that in Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:284, 288),
MaThiss points were classified as Group 1, Form 2 (Large with Contracting
Stems); however, these points generally have a straight stem with rounded
basal corners and thus, they have been reclassified for this report. The
Morhiss point was recovered from 41MC360, while the unclassifiable points
were recovered from 41AT86, 41AT87, and 41MC367 (Table 5).

Form 2. Large with Contracting Stems (7 specimens). This category consists of
large stemmed dart points with stem edges that contract (Fig. 21e-k).
Established types include Angostura, Desmuke, and Langtry points. The
Angostura point was recovered from 41MC108, the Desmuke point was
recovered from 41AT86, and the Langtry points were recovered from
41AT86 and 41MC360 (Table 5).
Form 3. Large with Expanding Stems (16 specimens). These large stemmed dart
points have expanding stems and include the established types of Darl,
Ensor, Fairland, and Frio (Fig. 21l-p, and 22a-k). The Dar! point was
recovered from 41MC367, the Ensor points from 41MC360, 41MC363, and
41MC367, the Frio point from 41AT77, and the Fairland point from
41MC360 (Table 5).
Form 4. Small with Contracting Stems (0 specimens). Specimens conforming to
this category were not recovered during this phase of the San Miguel
project.
Form 5. Small with Expanding Stems (7 specimens). These arrow points have
expanding stems and conform to either the Edwards or Scallorn type (Fig.
221-r). Edwards arrow points were recovered from 41MC360 and
41MC363; while Scallorn arrow points were recovered from 41AT77,
41MC108, 41MC360, and 41MC367 (Table 5).
Form 6. Unclassifiable Fragments of Large Stemmed Bifaces (2 specimens). This
category consists of fragments that are portions of stemmed dart points.
The specimens include barbs, medial fragments with barbs, and some distal
fragments (Fig. 22s).

80 I ARTIFACTS

Form 7. Unclassifiable Fragments of Small Stemmed Bifaces (5 specimens). This
category consists of distal, medial, and barb fragments of arrow points (Fig.
22t-x).
Form S. Small with Straight Stems (1 specimen). This category was added to
accomodate an Alba arrow point which has a stem with parallel edges (Fig.
22y). This specimen was recovered from 41MCI0S (Table 5).
Group 2. Unstemmed with Straight Bases (46 specimens).
Form 1. Complete Triangular (14 specimens). This category contains triangular
specimens with generally straight basal edges (Fig. 23a-d). Basal corners
range from sharp and angular to slightly rounded. Several of these
specimens can be classified as Tortugas dart points based on beveled lateral
edges and the thinning of the base. Early Triangular points also fit within
this category. Other specimens represent preforms or unfinished
specimens. Tortugas points were recovered from 41AT S6, 41MCI0S,
41MC362, and 41MC363; while a single Early Triangular specimen was
recovered from 41ATS6 (Table 5).
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (32 specimens). This category consists of proximal
fragments of triangular bifaces with straight basal edges (Fig. 23e-f).
Several ofthese specimens from 41ATI7, 41ATS6, 41MC363, and 41MC367
can be classified as Tortugas fragments (Table 5). One specimen from
41AT77 is classified as an arrow point preform.
Group 3. Unstemmed with Concave Bases (11 specimens).
Form 1. Complete Triangular (3 specimens). These triangular specimens have
concave bases and basal corners that are generally sharp and angular but
may also be slightly rounded (Fig. 23g-i).
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (S specimens). Several of the Group 3, Form 2
bifaces have beveled lateral edges and thinned bases; these are classified
as Tortugas points (Fig. 23j,k). They were recovered from 41AT77,
41MC360, and 41MC363 (Table 5).
Group 4. Unstemmed with Convex to Semicircular Bases (S9 specimens).
Form 1. Complete Triangular ( 17 specimens). These specimens are triangular and
have convex to semicircular basal edges (Fig. 23 1-0). One specimen has
been classified as an arrow point preform. Several other specimens have
been classified as either Tortugas or Refugio points. The Tortugas point was
recovered from 41MC363, while the Refugio points were recovered from
41MCI0S (Table 5).
Form 2. Steeply Beveled Blades (0 specimens). This category consists of a Late
Prehistoric tool type commonly referred to as the "beveled knife", (Hall,
Black, and Graves 1982:310-312). Beveled knives were not recovered from
this phase of the San Miguel project.
Form 3. Oval to Elliptical (3 specimens). These specimens are oval to elliptical
in outline and are generally larger and more crudely flaked than other thin
bifaces (Fig. 24a).
Form 4. Fragments with Convex to Semicircular Ends (69 specimens). These
fragments have convex to semicircular ends. They probably represent

---

...

LITHICARTIFACTS 183

fragments of Forms 1 through 3 described above (Fig. 24b-d). One
specimen from 41AT77 was classified as a Tortugas fragment (Table 5).
Group 5. Unstemmed Leaf Shaped (5 specimens). These specimens are similar to
Group 4 thin bifaces but differ in that they are long and slender with semicirÂ­
cular, convex, or slightly pointed bases (Fig. 24e-g). Maximum width generally
occurs at the midsection.
Group 6. Circular to Sub circular (2 specimens). These specimens are generally
circular to sub circular in outline and are more crudely flaked than most thin
bifaces (Fig. 24h).
Group 7. Diamond Shaped (0 specimens). This category consists of thin bifaces that
are widest at the midsection tapering to a point at either end. Specimens
conforming to these specifications were not recovered during this phase of the
San Miguel project.
Group 8. Bifaces with Sharp, Slender Projections (12 specimens). These specimens
have slender, needlelike points which suggest that they were utilized as drills
or perforators (Fig. 24 i-m and 25a-e). Descriptions of each drill/perforator
are provided in the discussions of individual sites.
Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (75 specimens). This category consists of thin
biface fragments with pointed ends (Fig. 25f-i). Many of these are distal
fragments but it is also possible that several may represent proximal fragments.
Several of these fragments are very well made and appear to be the tips of
finished tool forms; others are more crudely flaked and are probably fragments
of preforms broken during manufacture.
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (123 specimens). This group consists of
lateral and medial fragments that could not be placed in other categories (Fig.
25j-l).
DISTALLY BEVELED BIFACES AND UNIFACES (66 specimens)

This category consists of bifacial or unifacial tools that possess a beveled bit. These
specimens vary in outline from triangular to subtriangular, rectangular to subrectangular,
or oval to elliptical. The bit end can range from convex to deeply concave or "scooped
out." In the literature, various forms of these tools have been referred to as Clear Fork
gouges, Guadalupe adzes or tools, Olmos bifaces, and Nueces scrapers.
Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:319-320) established nine groups of distally beveled tools;
Taylor and Highley (n.d.) added a tenth group which is included in this analysis:
Group 1. Large Triangular to Subtriangular (Clear Fork Gouge Type 1, after Ray
1941)
Group 2. Large, Elongate, Rectangular to Subrectangular (Clear Fork Gouge Type 3,
after Ray 1941)
Form 1. Long
Form 2. Short
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subrectangular
Form 1. Triangular, Proximal End Pointed

LITHICARTIFACTS /85

Form 2. Triangular, Proximal End Rounded
Form 3. Rectangular to Subrectangular (Nueces scrapers, after Hester, White,
and White 1969)
Group 4. Small, Triangular to Subtriangular
Group 5. Small, Narrow Distal Fragments
Group 6. Long, Narrow, Elliptical (Guadalupe adzes, after Campbell 1976)
Group 7. Various Forms with Broad, Rounded, Low-Angle Bevels
Form 1. Elongate, Elliptical to Subrectangular
Form 2. Short, Broad, Subrectangular to Oval
Form 3. Subtriangular
Form 4. Distal Fragments
Group 8. Miscellaneous Forms
Form 1. Triangular to Sub triangular with Steep Bevel
Form 2. Steeply Beveled Sides
Form 3. Offset Bevels
Form 4. Broad, Flat, Triangular
Form 5. Odd Shapes
Group 9. Distal Fragments
Group 10. Proximal Fragments
Provenience, metric data, and material type are provided for selected tools in Table 7.
Group 1. Large Triangular to Subtriangular (Clear Fork Gouge, Type 1, after Ray
1941) (2 specimens). These large bifacial specimens are triangular to subtrianÂ­
gular in outline with the bevel at the wider end of each tool form (Fig. 26a,b).
Cross sections are generally biconvex. The dorsal face generally exhibits a
pronounced ridge which provides a prismatic appearance to the specimens.
The bevels on Group 1 specimens are generally broader, deeper, and more
"scooped out" than specimens in other groups.
Group 2. Large, Elongate, Rectangular to Subrectangular (Clear Fork Gouge Type
3, after Ray 1941) (0 specimens). Group 2 specimens were not present in the
artifact sample collected during this phase of the San Miguel project.
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subtriangular (24 specimens). Group 3
specimens differ from Group 1 specimens in that they are shorter, broader,
thinner, and may be more finely flaked. The unifacial specimens (46%) are
plano-convex in cross section, while bifacial specimens (54%) are biconvex in
cross section. This category is subdivided into three forms based on outline
shape and will be discussed below.
Recent analysis of Group 3 distally beveled tools from Choke Canyon and the
Lorna Sandia site (41LK28) have provided much-needed information regardÂ­
ing the chronology, associations, and technology of this tool type. During
Phase I of the Choke Canyon project, Hall, Black, and Graves (1982: 465)
placed these small, broad tools within the Late Archaic period; however,
subsequent excavations in the reservoir region resulted in the assessment that
these tools were probably Middle Archaic forms with possible minimal use into
the Late Archaic period (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399-400). At the Lorna

Sandia site, Group 3 tools were found associated with Abasolo, Lange, Morhiss,
and Tortugas points and were radiocarbon-dated to 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (Taylor
and Highley n.d.); thus, they were placed in the late Middle Archaic period at
the Lorna Sandia site (ibid.).
At Lorna Sandia, many of the Group 3 distally beveled tools were found in
burial caches. The following observations were made (Highley n.d.): unifacial
and bifacial forms occurred together in individual caches; unifacial specimens
made up 75% of the sample of Group 3 specimens; several of the unifacial
specimens exhibit bifacial trimming and shaping of the proximal end,
presumably to facilitate hafting; Group 3 specimens also occurred with Group
4 specimens; and, while chert was the most common material used, specimens
were also fashioned from silicified wood and chalcedony (ibid.).
Form 1. Triangular, Proximal End Pointed (9 specimens). These specimens are
triangular with a pointed proximal end (Fig. 26c,d). Five specimens are
bifacial; four specimens are unifacial. Several of the specimens exhibit
dorsal faces with a pyramidal configuration formed by the intersection of
the bevel with a pronounced ridge running lengthwise to the proximal end
of the specimen (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:326). Cortex, when present,
generally appears on the dorsal face.
Form 2. Triangular, Proximal End Rounded (11 specimens). These specimens
differ from Form 1 in that the proximal end is rounded rather than pointed
(Fig. 26e,f). Specimens may exhibit the dorsal pyramid configuration
described above for Form 1. Cortex, if present, generally occurs on the
dorsal face.
Form 3. Rectangular to Subrectangular (Nueces scraper after Hester, White and
White 1969) (4 specimens). These small specimens are rectangular to
subrectangular in outline (Fig. 26g-i). All are bifacial. Cortex, if present,
generally occurs on the dorsal face.
Group 4. Small Triangular to Sub triangular (9 specimens). Although similar to
Group 1 specimens, these tools are smaller, thinner, and well made (Fig.
27a,b). Generally, the bit edge is straight to convex; thus, the "scooped out"
bit characteristic assigned to Group 1 specimens is absent in this group. Cross
sections are generally biconvex.
Group 5. Small, Narrow Distal Fragments (1 specimen). These fragments are very
narrow and have a chisel-like appearance (Fig. 27c). All are bifacially worked.
Cross sections are biconvex.
Group 6. Long, Narrow, Elliptical (Guadalupe adzes) (1 specimen). These distinctive
tools are generally referred to as Guadalupe adzes (Fig. 27d) (Calhoun 1965;
Campbell 1976), Guadalupe tools (Hester and Kohnitz 1975; Black andMcÂ­
Graw 1985:142-154), or Guadalupe bifaces (Thrner and Hester 1985:216- 218).
Group 7. Various Forms with Broad, Rounded, Low-Angle Bevels (7 specimens).
This category is subdivided into four subclasses based on outline. Distal ends
are generally very convex or rounded and appear "shovel shaped" (Hall, Black,
and Graves 1982:332). The edge-angle of the bevel is usually very low. All
specimens are bifacial. Cross sections may vary from biconvex to plano-conÂ­

UTHICARTIFACTS / 91

vex. Cortex may be present and specimens are often thick and crudely flaked;
thus, these specimens may be preforms of previously described groups. This
group is subdivided according to shape.
Form 1. Elongate, Elliptical to Subrectangular (6 specimens) (Fig. 27e).
Form 2. Short, Broad, Subrectangular to Oval (0 specimens).
Form 3. Subtriangular (1 specimen) (Fig. 27f).
Form 4. Distal Fragments (0 specimens).
Group 8. Miscellaneous Forms (6 specimens). These distally beveled tools do not fit
within previously described groups and forms. Various subgroups include:
Form 1. Triangular to Sub triangular with Steep Bevels (2 specimens) (Fig. 27g).
Form 2. Steeply Beveled Sides (0 specimens).
Form 3. Offset Bevels (0 specimens).
Form 4. Broad, Flat, Triangular (0 specimens).
Form 5. Odd Shapes (4 specimens) (Fig. 27h).
Group 9. Distal Fragments (U specimens). This group consists of distal (beveled
end) fragments that cannot be included in above groups and forms (Fig. 27i).
Group 10. Proximal Fragments (4 specimens). This group consists of triangular
distally beveled tools whose bits have been removed by hard percusssion
(Highley n.d.). Generally, the force of impact to remove the bit was centrally
located along the ventral side of the bit (Fig. 27j,k). Removal of the bit was
apparently done to rejuvenate the working edge; however, the new edge was
never reshaped/resharpened for further use.
UNIFACES (34 specimens)

Unifaces are placed within six morphological categories.
Group 1. Large Elliptical
Group 2. Subcircular to Oval
Group 3. Triangular to Subtriangular
Form 1. Thick
Form 2. Thin
Group 4. Truncated or Fragmentary
Group 5. Irregular Shapes
Group 6. Fragments with Pointed Ends
Information regarding site provenience is provided in Table 3.
Group 1. Large Elliptical (0 specimens). Specimens conforming to Group 1 specificaÂ­
tions were not present within the sample collected during this phase of the San
Miguel project.
Group 2. Subcircular to Oval (13 specimens). This group consists of specimens that
are sub circular to oval in outline and plano-convex in cross section (Fig. 28a).
Group 3. Triangular to Subtriangular (1 specimen). This group consists of specimens
that are triangular to subtriangular in outline and plano-convex in cross section
(Fig. 28b). This group is subdivided into two forms based on thickness.

Form 1. Thick (1 specimen).
Form 2. Thin (0 specimens).
Group 4. Truncated or Fragmentary (15 specimens). This category was originally
described as "truncated or fragmentary with rounded ends" by Hall, Black, and
Graves (1982:355); however, this category needed to be broadened for this
phase of the San Miguel project. The category was changed to include all
truncated or fragmentary specimens (Fig. 28c).
Group 5. Irregular Shapes (5 specimens). This category consists of specimens whose
shapes do not conform to other uniface categories (Fig. 28d).
TRIMMED FLAKES (106 specimens)

Trimmed flakes are flakes or flake fragments exhibiting intentional shaping of an edge
or edges. The flaking has not substantially altered the original shape of the flake or flake
fragment. It is likely that trimmed flakes functioned as end scrapers, side scrapers, andlor
knives (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:356). Table 3 lists trimmed flakes by site.
Trimmed flakes are divided into four morphological groups.
Group 1. Circular to Sub circular (8 specimens) (Fig. 28e).
Group 2. Large, Oval to Elliptical (1 specimen) (Fig. 28f).
Group 3. Thin Blade Flakes and Flake Fragments (22 specimens).
Form 1. Rectangular (5 specimens) (Fig. 28g).
Form 2. Triangular (2 specimens) (Fig. 28h).
Form 3. Convergent (4 specimens) (Fig. 28i).
Form 4. Divergent (1 specimen) (Fig. 28j).
Form 5. Distal Fragments (4 specimens) (Fig. 29a).
Form 6. Miscellaneous Shapes (6 specimens) (Fig. 29b).
Group 4. Miscellaneous Thick Flakes and Flake Fragments (77 specimens).
Form 1. Divergent (10 specimens) (Fig. 29c).
Form 2. Rectangular (10 specimens) (Fig. 29d).
Form 3. Offset (15 specimens) (Fig. 2ge).
Form 4. Split Cobble (11 specimens) (Fig. 29f).
Form 5. Fragments with Rounded Ends (16 specimens) (Fig. 29g).
Form 6. Miscellaneous Fragments (13 specimens) (Fig. 29h).
UTILIZED DEBITAGE (108 specimens)

This category was added to the Choke Canyon typology to accomodate flakes with edge
modification that apparently resulted from use rather than from intentional shaping
(Nightengale et al. 1988:103). Table 3 provides counts of utilized flakes and chips per
site. The following categories were established:
Group 1. Primary Flakes (0 specimens).
Group 2. Secondary Flakes (66 specimens).
Group 3. Tertiary Flakes (25 specimens).

LITHICARTIFACTS / 95

Group 4. Chips (16 specimens).
Form 1. Cortex (7 specimens).
Form 2. No Cortex (9 specimens).
Group 5. Chunks (1 specimen).
Form 1. Cortex (1 specimen).
Form 2. No Cortex (0 specimens).
REJUVENATION FLAKES (5 specimens)

This category was added to the Choke Canyon typology based on the presence of this
unusual flake form at several south Texas sites. These narrow, generally curved flakes
were removed to rejuvenate an edge of a core or tool (Fig. 29i-k). These types of flakes
have been described by Shafer (1969, 1970) and Highley (n.d.). Core platform rejuvenaÂ­
tion flakes were struck to remove an edge of a core that no longer possessed usable
platforms (Highley n.d.). Unifacial tool rejuvenation flakes retain remnants of a unifaÂ­
cially trimmed edge; these flakes were removed to resharpen the working edge or bit of
a tool. Rejuvenation flakes were recovered from 41MC363 and 41MC367 (Table 3).
DEBITAGE (5654 Specimens)

This category differs slightly from Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:363-365) and follows
Nightengale et al. (1988:105-106). As Table 3 indicates, totals for flakes per site varied
considerably due to differences in flake collection strategies. The following categories
were utilized:
Primary Flakes (222 flakes)
Secondary Flakes (1460 specimens)
Tertiary Flakes (1504 specimens)
Chips (2468 specimens)
HAMMERSTONES (4 specimens)

Hammerstones are cobbles which exhibit pecking or battering on one or both ends and/or
along the circumference (Fig. 30a-c). The pecking or battering results from the use of
these cobbles as percussors for flintknapping. Hammerstones were recovered from
41MC108, 41MC363, and 41MC367 (Table 3).

HISTORICARTIFACTS 197

Ground Stone
MODIFIED SANDSTONE (44 specimens)

This category consists of sandstone pieces modified by grinding. Grinding slabs (Group
1), manos (Group 2), and grooved stone (Group 3) specimens were recovered (Table 3).
Group 1. Smoothed Slabs and Slab Fragments with Flat and/or Concave Faces (28
specimens). This group is composed of grinding slabs, often referred to as
metates (Fig. 31). They have been subdivided according to size.
Form 1. Large (1 specimen).
Form 2. Medium (4 specimens).
Form 3. Small (23 specimens).
Group 2. Subcircular to Angular Pieces with Flat and/or Convex Faces (11
specimens). These smaller pieces of sandstone exhibit a smoothed convexÂ­
shaped face suggesting that these specimens functioned as manos (hand-held
grinding instruments). They have been further grouped according to cross
section.
Form 1. Wedge-Shaped Cross Section (6 specimens) (Fig. 32a).
Form 2. Lenticular Cross Section (5 specimens) (Fig. 32b).
Group 3. Grooved Pieces (5 specimens). These specimens are grooved on one or
more faces (Fig. 33a,b). It is possible that these pieces of sandstone were used
to sharpen bone or wood tools or to smooth the edges of bifaces during the
tool-making process (Turner and Hester 1985:239).
PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ARTIFACTS

A single prehistoric ceramic sherd, a handle (Fig. 30d), was recovered from one site,
41MC363. The sherd is bone-tempered pottery typically found in south Texas. Black
(1982:390-453; 1986a:337-391) provides an in-depth study of the south Texas ceramic
tradition.
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS

Three sites contained a few historic artifacts dating to post-1900. Site 41MCI08 yielded
two undecorated whiteware sherds, site 41MC363 had one stoneware sherd and one aqua
glass bottle base, and site 41MC367 produced three amber glass bottle fragments, two
aqua glass bottle fragments, one nail, and one cartridge case.

CHAPTER 6
SITE ANALYSIS
41AT77-THE PUMA SITE

Introduction
Site 41AT77 occupies the lower western benches of a west-trending ridge lobe in the
upper reaches of the Hog Creek drainage system. Cultural materials are concentrated
in two areas of the wide, level benches. Elevation is approximately 100 meters mean sea
level at primary datum. Only 1 meter of elevation separates the two areas of concentraÂ­
tion, Areas A and B (Fig. 34). Slope gradient on the bench is < 1%. Vegetation is
characterized by scattered thorny brush and cacti with open grassy or barren areas (Fig.
35a). Mesquite trees are the dominant overstory vegetation. On the Hog Creek valley
floor, vegetation becomes increasingly dense culminating in extremely thick mesquite
and thorny brush along the present drainage channel. Surface exposures are weathered
Jackson Group clays that predominate throughout the study area.
Previous Research
41AT77 was classified as a multiple function, upland margin site when recorded in 1985
during Phase II intensive survey of the extended San Miguel Lignite Prospect (NightenÂ­
gale et al. 1988). Based on the observed surface distribution of cultural material, site size
was tentatively established at 90,000 square meters. Two concentrations of cultural
material along the lower benches were recognized and recommended for more intensive
study during Phase III limited testing. During the survey phase, select surface collection
sampled the cultural debris in the two areas of concentration. Temporal indicators, such
as Frio and Pedernales-like dart points, Scallorn arrow points and Nueces tools, suggest
encampments during the Middle and Late Archaic as well as Late Prehistoric periods.
Collected diagnostic artifacts were recovered in the Area 1 (now Area A) concentration
on the western bench. Also noted on the surface were flakes, pieces of fire-cracked
sandstone, cores, and bifaces. The quantity and distribution of artifacts suggested some
potential for meaningful information from a small, upland-margin site in the headwaters
of the Hog Creek drainage.
Testing Methods
Surface transects, one dog leash collection unit, and shovel probes were employed to
assess the horizontal and, to some extent, the vertical distribution of cultural debris at

101

104 I SITE ANALYSIS

41ATI7. Nine 25 x 25 em shovel probes were placed on the lower benches and upper
slopes both within areas of artifact concentration and in areas void of surface artifacts.
Matrix was sifted through l/4-inch mesh screen. Soil samples were collected from probes
selected on the basis of topographic location.
Site Stratigraphy

Although no cultural material beyond an isolated flake and two burned rocks in the upper
10 cm of probes 1 and 2 was recovered, the nine shovel tests provided the data for
reconstruction of soil deposition. Based on experience gained in previous excavation,
exposures of the same clays at 41MC362 and 41MC367, and the profiles in nearby gully
cuts at the site, probes were terminated upon contact with the compact calcium carbonate
clay zone which is culturally sterile. The depth of soil varies little with location; generally,
probes reached 30-40 cm in depth. These soils are dark grayish-brown blocky clays over
a compact zone of calcium carbonate clays that overlie the mudstone and sandstone
substrates. Sandstone outcrops along the lower bench edges of Area A.
Features

FEATURE 1

Located in Area B, Feature 1 is the only concentration of burned rock recorded at the
site (Fig. 36). Recent disturbances from a test well and sendero clearing exposed a
pavement of fire-cracked sandstone intermixed with small quantities of burned
palmwood and baked clay lumps. The most concentrated area of burned rock, mainly
sandstone, was assessed with a dog-leash collection unit. Close scrutiny of the immediate
area revealed a more substantial pavement of fire-cracked sandstone and burned
palmwood than previously thought. The total area of burned rock measured apÂ­
proximately 10 meters northwest-southeast x 8 meters northest-southwest. Fire-cracked
sandstone from the collection unit weighed 3760 grams. The majority of sandstone pieces
measured 3 cm3 , Smaller pieces of burned palmwood were found amid the scatter, a
characteristic observed at other sites in the prospect (see 41MC108).
Five burned clay lumps measuring 2-3 cm3, also common to features in the study area
(see 41MC108 and 41MC362), were recovered laying adjacent to fire-cracked sandstone
(Fig. 36), A 1 meter long, 15 em deep cross section trench excavated through the center
of the collection unit revealed feature material to a depth of 5 cm. No pit outline or
charcoal staining was observed in cross section The only chipped stone artifacts within
the 2 meter collection unit were one primary flake, two secondary flakes, and one core
(Group 6). Basically, the feature is a single layer of burned rock with outliers probably
scattered as a result of site reuse and modern disturbances. Dispersed fire-cracked
sandstone mapped west and south of the central concentration may be scattered outliers
of a large pavement feature.

Artifacts

The following lithic materials were recovered from 41AT77: 43 cores, 6 thick bifaces, 43
thin bifaces, 4 distally beveled tools, 1 uniface, 7 trimmed flakes, 3 utilized flakes, 1
grinding slab fragment, 2 manos, 1 grooved abrader, and a few flakes and chips (Table 3).
In most cases in the discussion below, only the groups and forms (as defined in the
Artifacts chapter) will be listed as they provide adequate descriptive information. The
more diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, distally beveled tools, etc.) will be
described in detail along with information regarding chronological placement and
geographical distribution. Some of the typical South Texas groups and forms of artifacts
are not represented at this site. Metric data and material type for selected thick bifaces,
thin bifaces, and distally beveled tools are provided in Tables 4-7.

Group 1. Stemmed (3 specimens)
Form 3. Large with Expanding Stems (2 specimens)
Specimen 56: This dart point fragment is missing the distal end (Fig. 21e).
The side notches are shallow and the slightly expanding stem has rounded
corners and a straight basal edge. The base has been thinned by removal
of short, narrow flakes from both faces. This specimen does not fit within
the existing dart point typology.
Specimen 147: This specimen is the basal fragment of a Frio point (Fig. 21m).
Deep corner notches have produced a wide expanding stem; basal corners
are rounded and the basal edge is broadly concave.
Chronological Placement: Frio points are placed within the Transitional
Archaic period, ca. 600 B.C.-A.D. 200, by Turner and Hester 1985: 100); Hall,
Hester, and Black (1985:400-401) place Frio points within the Late Archaic
period, ca. 400 B.C.-A.D. 900.
Geographical Distribution: Frio points are found throughout central and
south Texas and extend to the lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos regions (Turner
and Hester 1985:100).
Form 5. Small with Expanding Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 5: This arrow point fragment is missing its distal tip and portions of
its expanding stem. The specimen has deep, narrow corner notches that
have produced an expanding stem. Portions of the stem are missing, but
the basal edge appears to have been straight and, thus, the specimen is
probably a Scallorn point. The specimen is very thin and well made. The
blade edges have been serrated.
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200
(Turner and Hester 1985:189).
Geographical Distribution: Occurs throughout Texas (ibid.).

4IA177-THE PUMA SITE / 107

Specimen 96: This assymetrical triangular specimen probably represents a
manufacturing failure. A large knot on one face prevented final thinning
and shaping of the biface.
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (5 specimens)
Specimen 28: This large specimen is missing the distal end. The basal edge is
relatively straight.
Specimen 40: This small triangular biface is made of silicified wood. The
specimen probably represents an arrow point preform and it appears that
a notch was started near one corner. Similar arrow point preforms have
been recovered from other south Texas sites (Highley et al. 1978: 156; Black
1986:76; Highley 1986:64, 109; Highley n.d.).
Specimen 43: This fragment appears to be a basal corner of a biface with a
straight basal edge.
Specimen 101: This fragment has parallel to slightly contracting lateral edges.
The base has been thinned from the basal edge producing a wedge-shaped
cross section.
Specimen 147: This specimen is the proximal end of a Tortugas point. The
biface has been basally thinned by the removal of several long, wide flakes
struck from the basal edge. The specimen has been steeply chipped or
beveled along both sides of both lateral edges.
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period, and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985:152; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399). Tortugas
points were associated with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. from
the late Middle Archaic cemetery zone at the Lorna Sandia site (Taylor and
Highley n.d.)
Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and the lower Rio
Grande; occasionally found in central Texas and the lower Pecos (Turner
and Hester 1985:152).
Group 3. Unstemmed with Concave Bases (1 specimen)
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (1 specimen)
Specimen 76: This specimen is the proximal fragment of a Tortugas point. The
base has been thinned by the removal of flakes struck from the basal edge;
one large, broad flake has been removed from one face while a series of
narrow flakes have been removed from the other face. Both sides of the
lateral edges have been steeply chipped or beveled.

Specimen 53: This specimen appears to be the proximal end of a Tortugas
point. The distal end is missing. The specimen exhibits rounded basal
corners, is basally thinned, and is beveled along both sides of the lateral
edges.

Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (12 specimens). These fragments are the
distal ends of broken bifaces. Based on the degree of fine flaking and symÂ­
metry, specimens 80, 84, 97, 98, 103, and 124 appear to be fragments of dart
points.
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (13 specimens). Specimens 19,99, and 108
appear to be dart point or tool fragments.
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces (4 specimens)
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Sub triangular (1 specimen)
Form 2. Triangular, Proximal End Rounded (1 specimen)
Specimen 13: This specimen is primarily unifacial; minimal flaking on the
ventral side has removed the bulb of percussion. This technique was
observed among distally beveled tools recovered from the Lorna Sandia site
and it was postulated that the bulb of percussion was removed to allow for
a more secure hafting of the tool (Highley n.d.). The specimen exhibits a
pyramidal configuration on the dorsal side as described in the Lithic ArÂ­
tifacts section of this report. The bit edge is slightly convex. All cortex has
been removed.
Chronological Placement: Short, broad distally beveled tools date to the
Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1985:205; Hall, Hester, and
Black 1986:399-400; Highley n.d.). At the Lorna Sandia site, these tools
were associated with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. and co-ocÂ­
curred with Abasolo, Lange, Morhiss, and Tortugas dart points (Taylor and
Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Common in south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:205; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:398-400).
Group 4. Small Triangular to Subtriangular (1 specimen)
Specimen 186: This specimen is primarily unifacial although a few flakes have
been removed from the ventral side. The cross section is plano convex; the
dorsal side exhibits a pyramidal configuration. Small patches of cortex
remain on the dorsal side. The bit edge is straight.
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Groups 3 and 4 distally beveled tools, also see Group 3, Form
2, Specimen 13.)
Group 9. Distal Fragments (1 specimen)
Specimen 32: This bifacial tool and has slightly convex bit edge. All cortex has
been removed.
Group 10. Proximal Fragments (1 specimen)
Specimen 134: Based on overall configuration, this bifacial specimen appears to
be the proximal portion of a distally beveled tool. The breakage pattern
suggests that the distal end was removed by hard percussion, a technique
apparently used when rejuvenatIng the bit edge (Highley n.d.).

Summary and Interpretation

41AT77 is an open campsite located along the lower valley margin bench and floor of a
major tributary system of the headwaters of Hog Creek. Based on location, prehistoric
site activities appear to have focused on the resources within the Hog Creek valley. The
artifacts and feature are the only remaining evidence of activities performed at the site
but the distribution of cultural material exposed on the surface is sufficient to reconstruct
general activity loci (Fig 37a-c). In general, most elements of the south Texas tool kit are
present at the site.
The most dramatic difference between Areas A and B is the presence of a large
fire-cracked sandstone feature at the latter and the minimal presence of burned rock at
the former where only 15 small 2 cm3 pieces of sandstone were observed. The feature
suggests Area B was used and reused for specialized processing of resources.
Lithic artifacts were largely found in Area A and rarely in Area B (Table 8). The tools,
cores, and flakes in Area A may be secondary refuse deposits (cf. Binford 1978; Hull
1987) where discarded lithics include broken cores (Group 9), exhausted cores (Group
6), thick bifaces (Group 3) and fragments. Distally beveled tools (Groups 3 and 4), thin
bifaces (Groups 1-4) and fragments, cores from Groups 2 and 3, and modified sandstone
(Groups 1 and 2) are also more frequent in Area A. Area A, thus, appears to be an area
of discard.
Task related activities can be postulated on the basis of presence or absence of certain
classes of artifacts. Though low in frequency, thick bifaces. thick biface fragments, and
primary flakes probably resulted from primary biface reduction of chert cobblesÂ·
transported from La Jarita Creek deposits; a distance of approximately 2.5 km. Thin
biface preforms (Group 2, Form 2) and manufacturing failures (Group 2, Form 1), as well
as finished stemmed and unstemmed thin bifaces, indicate later stages of reduction.
Grinding implements imply processing of foodstuffs, the raw material perhaps acquired
from sandstone outcrops exposed along the lower benches in Area A. Distally beveled
tools (Groups 3 and 4) and trimmed flakes represent a range of possible tasks that include
cutting and scraping. A high frequency of cores could indicate more reliance on the
manufacture of expediency flake tools for immediate use. Middle and Late Archaic as
well as Late Prehistoric occupations are demonstrated by distally beveled tools, Tortugas
and Frio dart points, Scallom arrow points, and arrow preforms. The low frequency of
artifacts in general suggests an area used and reused sporadically on a short term basis
over a long period of time.

Introduction

Site 41AT86 is a linear lithic scatter situated on the northeastern lobe of an upland divide
formed by two header tributaries of Caballos Creek (Fig. 38). The majority of cultural
material is scattered on the lower slopes and benches of the La Parita Creek valley
margins. The wide, level benches along the northern slopes offered ideal locations for
open campsites. Over time, these areas eroded and deflated, leaving only remnant
islands of clays secured by grassy vegetation. Profiles exposed by sheet erosion and

114 I SITEANALYSIS

subsequent gullying demonstrate 5-30 cm of clay above mudstone and sandstone subÂ­
strates variably exposed on the surface (Fig. 39a). The high rate of erosion has left the
exposed surfaces rilled and deeply gullied in some areas. Open grassy areas scattered
with mesquite and live oak characterize the benches. Dense brush abscures the slopes.
Scattered brushy species with mesquite broken by open grassy clearings grow atop the
lobe. Species of cacti are common to all elevations. A group of 10 dwarfed live oaks on
the north edge of the site suggests a mott once grew on the benches. Trees are now
anchored in mudstone with remnant clay secured by the roots. Elevation ranges from
110 meters mean sea level on the lower slope and bench area to 120 meters mean sea
level at primary datum atop the lobe.
Previous Research

The multiple function upland divide site was recorded during the 1985 survey (NightenÂ­
gale et at. 1988). At that time a select surface collection sampled the scattered cultural
debris within a site area estimated at 120,000 square meters. Only a small quantity of
burned rock was observed amid a dense scatter of tools, cores, and flakes. Palmwood,
quartzite, and chert constituted the observed raw lithic material. Temporally diagnostic
projectile points suggested occupation during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
Given the array of cultural material in this upland divide setting overlooking the La Parita
Creek valley, the site was recommended for further testing.
Testing Methods

At 41AT86, transects and 16 dog-leash collection units were used to evaluate the horizonÂ­
tal distribution of cultural material. No subsurface probes nor test units were excavated
because of shallowness and the dynamic nature of the clayey deposits, e.g. their
shrink/swell characteristics. The high rate of erosion along the lower slopes and benches
limited confidence for meaningful distribution of cultural material to the clay caps and
their edges where newly eroded burned rock and tools were considered indicative of
actual use areas. Artifacts recorded on the erosional substrate surfaces were considered
to be redeposited and used in this analysis for inventory counts only.
Site Stratigraphy

The extensive erosion that has left only islands of shrink/swell clay veneer restricted site
assessment to surface analysis. Clays varied in depth from 5-30 cm over basal sandstone
substrates.

116 I SITE ANALYSIS

Features

Only two features were recorded in the 16 collection units placed over burned rock
concentrations. Feature designation was based on observation of concentrated burned
rock in an area where the probability of remnant hearths was considered more secure
than in areas where burned rock was evidently dispersed by sheet and rill erosion onto
exposed substrates. Burned rock weight from non~feature collection units is listed below
in Table 9.
FEATURE 1

The portion of Feature 1 within Collection Unit 8 consists of 18 pieces of fire~cracked
sandstone concentrated in a 2- x 2~meter area (Fig. 40). The main portion of the feature
lies along the edge of an eroding clay cap. Another 18 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone
were observed eroding from the edge of the feature onto the nearby substrates. InÂ­
dividual pieces of sandstone measure approximately 3 cm3 in size. The size of the burned
rock in the feature and elsewhere in the study area suggests discard of unusable
sandstone, the disintegrated fragments of larger tabular pieces similar to those found in
Feature 1 at 41MC363. Only one primary flake, two tertiary flakes, and one corticate
chip were found within the 2 meter collection area. Burned rock from the collection unit
weighed 1360 grams. Scattered peripheral rock was not weighed.
FEATURE 2

Feature 2 consisted of a more dispersed cluster of fire-cracked sandstone than found in
Feature 1. Again, small pieces of fire-cracked sandstone measuring approximately 3 cm3
were found atop and along the eroding edge of the clay cap (Fig. 41). Dark stains were
observed amid the portion of the feature on the clay cap, but no charcoal was recovered.
Four secondary flakes, one tertiary flake, and 8 chips were within the 2 meter collection
unit placed over this feature. Total feature area measured 6 x 7 meters. A cross section
of the feature showed no pit outline and sandstone extended only 5 cm into the 15 cm
clay cap. Burned rock from Collection Unit 13, placed over that portion of the feature
on top of the clay cap, weighed 2866 grams.
Artifacts

The following lithic materials were recovered from 41AT86: 115 cores, 23 thick bifaces,
63 thin bifaces, 15 distally beveled tools, 9 unifaces, 10 trimmed flakes,S utilized flakes
and chips (debitage), 1 grinding slab fragment, and numerous flakes and chips (Table 3).
In most cases in the discussion below, only the groups and forms will be listed as they
provide adequate descriptive information (for definitions, refer to the Artifact chapter
of this report). Several of the typical South Texas groups and forms of artifacts are not
represented at this site. The more diagnostic artifacts (projectile points and other thin

120 / SITE ANALYSIS

Specimen 127: This proximal fragment has parallel stem edges for 1.0 cm
before one edge angles inward due to reworking of that edge (Fig. 21a).
Slight dulling is present on the stem edges. The basal edge is concave.
Form 2. Large with Contracting Stems (3 specimens)
Specimen 83: Tho specimens were given the same field identification number
and, although they are similar, there are differences that prevent classifying
them within the same point form. One specimen can be classified as a
Desmuke point (Note: the other point is described below). The lozengeÂ­
shaped, shoulderless point has stem edges that contract to a point. The
blade edge is alternately beveled. The stem portion of the point is thinned,
while the blade is relatively thick.
Chronological Placement: Late Archaic period (Turner and Hester
1985:86).
Geographical Distribution: Primarily south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:86).
Specimen 83: This point is asymmetrical (Fig. 2lf). Slight shoulders are
present and one stem edge is straight while the other edge contracts. The
basal edge is straight with rounded corners. This specimen is more
uniformly thick than the Desmuke point described above; the basal portion
has been minimally thinned. Alternate beveling is present along the upper
portion of the distal tip.
Specimen 239: This thin, well-made specimen is the stem portion of a projecÂ­
tile point (Fig. 21g).
Group 2. Unstemmed with Straight Bases (16 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (7 specimens)
Specimens 48: This triangular specimen is missing its distal tip and one basal
corner. Attempts to thin the upper portion of one face were unsuccessful.
The specimen has been basally thinned. Although the biface lacks beveling,
it is classified as a Tortugas point; it probably represents Stage 1 of the
Tortugas continuum as proposed by Highley (n.d.).
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period, and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985:152; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399). At the
Lorna Sandia site (41LK28), a late Middle Archaic cemetery, Tortugas
points were associated with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (Taylor
and Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and lower Rio
Grande; occasionally found in central Texas and the Lower Pecos (Turner
and Hester 1985:152).
Specimen 84: This Tortugas specimen has parallel lower edges; near the
midsection of the biface the lateral edges begin to converge to form the
distal end. The basal edge is straight. The specimen has been basally
thinned and the lateral edges are beveled or steeply chipped.
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Tortugas points, the reader is referred to Thin Bifaces, Group
2, Form 1, Specimen 48.)

41AT86/ 121

Specimen 126: This crude Tortugas specimen has been basally thinned, has a
thick distal end, and has been beveled along several lateral edges.
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Tortugas points, the reader is referred to Thin Bifaces, Group
2, Form 1, Specimen 48.)
Specimen 134: This very thin, well-made triangular specimen is classified as
an Early Triangular point (Fig 23a). Characteristics include parallel, obliÂ­
que flaking, basal thinning, and beveled edges. This specimen also exhibits
an impact fracture.
Chronological Placement: Early Archaic, ca. 3700 B.c. to 3600 B.C. (Turner
and Hester 1985:89).
Geographical Distribution: Central, south and southwest Texas (ibid.).
Specimen 164: This Tortugas specimen has been basally thinned and exhibits
beveling along the lateral edges (Fig. 23b).
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Tortugas points, the reader is referred to Thin Bifaces, Group
2, Form 1, Specimen 48.)
Specimen 168: This small, triangular specimen is poorly made. It is thick,
exhibits irregular flaking, and has sinous edges. Basal thinning is present
and it is likely that the specimen represents a crudely reworked Tortugas
point.
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Tortugas points, the reader is referred to Thin Bifaces, Group
2, Form 1, Specimen 48.)
Specimen 186: This large, thick specimen is crudely made (Fig. 23c). The
biface was made on a flake and it retains the curvature of the flake.
Thinning problems are obvious and the specimen is probably a manufacturÂ­
ing reject or failure.
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (9 specimens)
Specimens 10, 129, and 225 are classified as Tortugas points based on basal
thinning and beveling of the lateral edges.
(For information regarding chronological placement and geographical disÂ­
tribution of Tortugas points, the reader is referred to Thin Bifaces, Group
2, Form 1, Specimen 48.)
Group 4. Unstemmed with Convex Bases (9 specimens)
Form 3. Oval to Elliptical (1 specimen)
Form 4. Fragments with Convex to Semicircular Ends (8 specimens). These
specimens exhibit varying degrees of uniformity and thinness. Most appear
to be broken preforms or manufacturing failures.
Group 8. Bifaces with Sharp, Slender Projections (2 specimens)
Specimen 85: This biface fragment appears to be the proximal end of a drill or
perforator (Fig. 24i). The proximal end of the specimen contracts to a
point. The distal end is broken off; however, the existing portion of the
distal end has been alternately beveled to produce a sharply contracting
distal end.

122/ SITEANALYSIS

Specimen 88: This small worked flake is somewhat similar to a Perdiz arrow point;
however, barbs are lacking, one face had very little flaking and/or shaping,
and special treatment seems to have been given to one lateral edge. The
dorsal side of the flake exhibits pressure flaking along the extremely
pointed end. The platform side of the flake exhibits a series of short
pressure flaking scars all along the right lateral side, from tip to tip, with
the flaked edge resembling the edge of a finely worked trimmed flake. A
minimal amount of flaking occurs on the left lateral edge. The specimen
might be a scraping tool.
Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (10 specimens). Specimens 31 and 116 are
well made and appear to be distal ends of finished dart points or other tool
forms.
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (22 specimens)
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces (15 specimens)

Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subrectangular (9 specimens)

Specimen 35: This specimen is primarily unifacial with a bit edge that is
straight to slightly convex (Fig. 26d). The dorsal side is pyramidal in
configuration. All cortex has been removed.
Chronological Placement: Short, broad distally beveled tools (Groups 3
and 4) date to the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1985:205;
Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399-400; Highley n.d.). At the Lorna Sandia

B.C. and co-occurred with Abasolo, Lange, Morhiss, and Tortugas dart points
(Taylor and Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Common in south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:205; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:398-400).
Specimen 175: This asymmetrical specimen is primarily unifacial although
there is some bifacial shaping of the proximal end. The bit edge is straight.
The left corner and a portion of the adjacent lateral edge is missing (Fig. ).
The specimen exhibits an asymmetrical pyramidal configuration on the
dorsal face. A few small patches of cortex are present on the proximal end.

Specimen 64: This unifacial, subrectangular specimen has a wide, convex bit
edge (Fig. 26h). Cortex covers one-third of the dorsal face, while flaking
occurs only along the bit edge and the right lateral edge. One large flake
was removed from the ventral face; it was probably struck to remove the
platform to allow for a more secure hafting of the tool (Highley n.d.).

Form 3. Subtriangular (1 specimen)
Specimen 202: This large biface has lateral edges that contract to a rounded
proximal end (Fig. 27f). The bit edge is slightly convex and the angle of
beveling is so low that a distinct beveled edge is not as obvious as with other

Vertebrate and Molluscan Fauna

No vertebrate faunal remains were observed during the testing at 41AT86. One mussel
shell fragment was collected from the surface. Unfortunately, the sample lacked its umbo
and is too small to identify to the species level.
Flora

No soil samples from 41AT86 were analyzed for presence/absence of phytoliths.
Summary and Interpretation

The combined use of plotted surface artifacts (Fig. 42a-c )with data from the 16 collection
units (Table 9) helped to isolate areas along the north side ofthe site where activities may
have focused. Concentrations were delineated based on the presence of burned rock and
clusters of artifacts. Core nuclei (Group 6) and core fragments (Group 9) are the most
common (N = 53) artifacts discarded in these areas. Cores from Groups 2 and 3 total 39.
Basal fragments of preforms or manufacturing failures (Thin Biface, Group 4, Form 4),
and other thin biface fragments (Groups 9 and 10) were also found in these areas. The
quantities of burned rock suggest encampments where processing of some sort co-ocÂ­
cured wi th other activities such as hunting and foraging. Observed flake types and thick
bifaces indicate primary and secondary reduction as well as tool maintenance took place
on site. Cores, the most abundant artifact, could be indicative of the manufacture of
expediency flake tools. The high frequency of cores indicates more reliance on this type
of tool manufacture than biface reduction. The high quantity of discarded core nuclei
suggests constant reuse of favored cores with probable curation and later discard at the
site. Alternately, cores may have been left at the site for later use. Tortugas bifaces and

distally beveled tools (Groups 3 and 4) remaining on the site attribute most of the activity
to the Middle Archaic period with some overlap into the Early and Late Archaic periods.
The findings at Choke Canyon (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986) indicate increased use of
that area during the Middle Archaic and Late Archaic periods. Possibly, this influx of
higher population with concomittant increased site use is also reflected at 41AT86.
Although the absence of complete projectile points may be attributable to relic hunters,
other significant artifact classes are rare to absent. Only one grinding slab fragment was
recovered. Sandstone raw material would be most easily procured at nearby 41AT85
where two large single-faceted metates were found overturned. These large metates
were not easily moved and it may be they were left at the site for later use, probably on
a seasonal basis, implying scheduled returns to the site area were planned. Also not
accounted for in the assemblage are hammerstones. Given the evidence for primary and
secondary reduction at the site, hammerstones should be present. This may indicate
more reliance on nonpreservable antler billets or it may be that these tools were prized
and curated as suggested by their inclusion in Late Middle Archaic caches at 41LK28
(Taylor and Highley n.d.).

41AT87

Introduction

41AT87 overlooks the La Parita Creek valley from a northeast-southwest trending
ridgeline. This point is one of the highest in the area at an elevation of 120 meters mean
sea level (Fig. 43). The same ridgeline forms the divide between two header tributaries
of Souse Creek, a right bank tributary of La Parita Creek. Vegetation consists of scattered
thorny brush and mesquite with grassy clearings. Soils are shrink-swell Jackson Group
clays, discussed in more detail below.
A large percentage of the site surface was disturbed by two transmission line corridors
and a recent pipeline reroute which cut 30-meter-wide corridors through the northern
half of the site (Fig. 39b). A well pad has affected an area approximately 50 x 100 meters
on the northern slopes of the site. These disturbances have exposed cultural material on
the northern half of the site. The study area was limited to a long linear clearing on the
south side of the site where surfaces exhibited little to no disturbance and a light scatter
of cultural material indicated possible subsurface deposits.
Previous Research

This light scatter of flakes, tools, and burned rock in a 20,000 square meter area was
recorded as a limited function, upland divide site during the 1985 Phase II survey of the
extended San Miguel Prospect (Nightengale et al. 1988:36-37). The only temporal
diagnostic was an Ensor dart point attributable to Late Archaic occupation(s). Collected
artifacts included: 1 core (Group 9), 1 uniface (Group 3, Form 1), 2 trimmed flakes

(Group 3, Form 4 and Group 4, Form 1). The most common artifact classes were
secondary and tertiary flakes of chert and to a lesser degree, palmwood. Two cores, one
of chert and one of palmwood, several thin biface fragments, and a very light scatter of
burned rock were noted. An undisturbed area in a linear clearing on the south side of
the site became the focus of Phase III subsurface investigations. Although no shovel
probes were dug to determine the depth of cultural deposits, the Atascosa County soil
survey (Soil Conservation Service 1980) indicated a good possibility for deep soils that
may hold buried archeological materials.
Testing Methods

Transects and pin flagging of artifacts were used in surface collection and to place two 1
x 2 meter test pits in areas with deeper soils. Both were excavated to a depth of 30 cm
in 10 cm arbitrary increments and the matrix dry screened through 1/4 in. mesh. Eight
backhoe trenches were dug to bedrock and profiled.
Site Stratigraphy

Site stratigraphy is based on the eight backhoe trench profiles and two test units (Fig. 44).
Cultural material was confined to the upper 10-20 cm. All Munsell readings were dry.
ZONE I
Very dark gray (lOYR3/1) blocky silty clay with rootlets and some roots present. The
zone is hard-packed and ranges from 10-20 cm below surface. The cultural material
found in this zone is the result of shrink-swell redeposition.
ZONE II
Zone II is a grayish brown (10YR512) blocky clay with some calcium carbonate mottling
and is 20 cm to 50 cm thick. The zone is dryer and more compact than Zone I. No cultural
material was observed in profiles.
ZONE III

Zone III is a light gray to very pale brown (10YR7/2.5) clay which is 10 cm to 50 cm thick.
Clays are less blocky, higher in calcium carbonate content, more compact and drier than
those in the preceding zone.

Features and Burned Rock Concentrations
No features nor burned rock concentrations were found during Phase III investigations
at 41AT87.
Artifacts
The following lithic materials were recovered from 41AT87: 7 cores, 2 thick bifaces, 3
thin bifaces, 1 grinding slab fragment, and 17 flakes and chips (Table 3). In most cases in
the discussion below, only the groups and forms (as defined in the Artifacts chapter) will
be listed as they provide adequate descriptive information. Two of the thin bifaces will
be described in detail. Due to the nature of the sample, many of the groups and forms
of artifacts are not represented at this site. Metric data and material type for thick bifaces
(Groups 3 and 8) and thin bifaces (Group 3) are provided in Tables 4 and 5.

No vertebrate faunal remains were recovered during excavations at the site. One Polygyra
texasiana terrestrial gastropod shell was collected from Level 3 of Test Pit 2 (Appendix

Use of snails as a food source has been documented at 41MC362 (Appendix 3) and
elsewhere in South Texas (Hester and Hill 1975) but the 41AT87 shells were not obviously
concentrated in discard piles and showed no evidence of heat alteration.
Flora

No soil samples from 41AT87 were analyzed for presence/absence of phytoliths.
Summary and Interpretations

41AT87 is located on northeast-southwest trending ridgeline between two header
tributaries of Souse Creek. The site occupies a high point overlooking the La Parita
Creek Valley to the north. Eight backhoe trenches and two 1- x 2-meter test pits were
used to assess the subsurface deposits. Four stratigraphic zones were identified in
backhoe trench profiles: three are clay and one is unconsolidated sandstone bedrock
(Fig. 44, Table 10). None of the clays are in situ developed soils. All four zones are
composed of sediment derived from the Jackson Group.

Controlled excavations and backhoe trench observations indicated that only the upper
10-20 cm contained a limited quantity of cultural material redeposited in shrink-swell
cracks. Test pits produced only minimal quantities of debitage and a few pieces of
fire-cracked sandstone (Table 11). The majority of the material was exposed on the
surface along the ridgeline. Concentrations in the northern portion of the site were the
result of bulldozing of the upper 10 cm where cultural material has lodged from constant
shrink and swell of the clays. The lithic inventory from subsurface and surface investigaÂ­
tions suggests limited use of the site. By contrast, 41AT86, located approximately 500
meters to the northwest, contains a much higher quantity and frequency of different
classes of artifacts more characteristic of repeated or prolonged occupation.
Cores are the most frequent artifact recovered from 41AT87. The collected specimens
were fairly evenly distributed over the site surface. Cores could be indicative of exÂ­
pediency flake tool production for various tasks and/or later production of formal tools.
The inventory includes only three fragments of thin bifaces and two fragments of thick
bifaces. The observed debitage, which included secondary and tertiary chert flakes of
various colors and sizes, demonstrates that some secondary reduction had occurred on
site. One primary chert flake, recorded during Phase II survey, is the sole evidence for
primary reduction of cobble(s) probably procured from the La Parita Creek gravel
sources. Also, palmwood cores and flakes illustrate another raw material exploited
throughout the prospect, probably collected in conjunction with chert procurement in
the La Parita and La larita drainages. Whether intentionally or accidentally, many
specimens appear burned.
Sandstone outcrops, in beds and exfoliated fragments, were observed on the western
crests near the test pits. The small amount of fire-cracked sandstone found at the site
was probably procured from these and other nearby sources. The one small grinding slab
fragment found on the surface illustrates the use of sandstone for implements and

probable subsequent processing of vegetal resources. As with many sites in the study
area, access to sandstone may have influenced the selection of occupational locations.
The location of 41AT87 on the highest point in the area, is optimal for viewing game
drawn to the water in La Parita Creek. The lithic assemblage suggests the production
and maintenance of a limited tool kit manufactured from raw materials brought to the
site. The fragments from projectile points found during Phase III investigation and the
Ensor dart point found during Phase II documentation may confirm the importance of
hunting suggested by the site location. The Ensor, the only temporal diagnostic found on
the site, is indicative of occupation(s) dating from the later part of the Late Archaic
period.
41MCI08
Introduction

Site 41MC108 is located along the lower bench of a west-trending lobe, facing a broad
stream valley that eventually empties into Hog Creek (Fig. 45). The site is approximately
2.5 km above the confluence of La Jarita and Hog creeks. The several sites found in this
valley during the 1985 survey (Nightengale et al. 1988) include 41MC360, also tested
during the current project.
Dense thorny brush and cacti grow on the slopes. Moderately open grassy clearings on
the lower bench are surrounded by brushy vegetation and cacti. The limited overstory
consists of scattered mesquite. The western valley flats nearby support open grassy areas
with scattered brush and mesquite which extend to the stream channel. The shallow
channel, in most places only 1 meter deep, is choked with brush and mesquite.
Cultural debris was concentrated in two areas: Area A on the western edge of the bench
at 105 meters mean sea level and Area B on the top of the lobe at 120 meters mean sea
level. The width of the bench averages about 50 meters. Erosion has cut back the bench
face leaving a denuded bedrock slope with a remnant clay veneer over substrates (Fig.
39c). Exposed substrata extend from the eroded edge of the bench west to the present
stream channel. Erosion in the lower portion of the valley has been accelerated by root
plowing (Jimmy Rayes personal communication 1988). Rayes also stated that the area
was a more grassy prairie as late as the 1930s, an opinion supported by other local
landowners (Buck and Eleanor Maspero, personal communication 1988).
Erosion of the clay veneer also redeposited cultural material on the exposed substratum
on the edges of the top of the lobe. Another factor responsible for the visibility of cultural
material over most of the site area is the numerous holes left by feral hogs rooting for
food. As a result, fire-cracked rock and artifacts have been exposed from the upper 5 em
of clayey matrix.

Soils are comparable to those in most of the study area. Varying depths of weathered
Jackson Group clays consistently overlie mudstone and sandstone. Uncharacteristically,
41MC108lacked visible outcrops of sandstone although the site contained relatively high
counts of modified and fire-cracked sandstone.
Previous Research

When first recorded in 1974, (Shafer and Baxter 1975) only the lower bench area, now
Area A, was designated as 41MC108, a multiple function upland margin site. The site
was described as "flakes, burned rock, petrified wood (worked and burned) and very little
raw lithic supply" (site survey form-TARL files). A surface collection of artifacts included
four cores; primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes; bifaces from initial and secondary
stages of reduction; and a gouge (Shafer and Baxter 1975:32). Additional surface collecÂ­
tion was recommended on the site form.
In 1985, the site was reevaluated as part of the Phase II survey (Nightengale et al. 1988).
The majority of cultural debris again was observed eroding from the lower bench edges.
Artifacts were also recorded on the upper western and southern slopes, extending the
site size to 90,000 square meters. The array of cultural material included flakes, cores,
bifaces in all stages of reduction, unifaces, and fire-cracked rock. Chert was the primary
lithic material; secondary material consisted of palmwood and chalcedony. A select
surface collection recovered three unifaces, nine thin bifaces, one thick biface, and one
trimmed flake (Nightengale et ai. 1988:72). A discrete chalcedony chipping station was
isolated along the eastern edge of the bench.
The bench surface is apparently level enough to check the effects of sheet wash on
cultural material so that there has been minimal horizontal redeposition. Evidence to
support this comes from the relatively intact chalcedony chipping station, recorded
during the survey phase (Nightengale et ai. 1988:69). Debitage analysis indicated primary
and secondary reduction of no more than two pieces of chalcedony in a small 2 x 4 area.
Two small arrow point preforms and an unclassified serrated arrow point blade with
broken stem were found amid the feature debris. The retention of this feature in such a
small area suggests a stable surface for at least the last 500-1000 years.
These arrow points, and Catan and Refugio-like dart points found in other areas of the
site, evidenced Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The upland location of the site
and the intact chipping station contributed to the decision to test the site for NRHP
eligibiiity.
Testing Methods

Surface collection by dog leash collection units and the recording of exposed features
were employed to assess the horizontal distribution of cultural material at 41MC108.
Feature 1 was excavated in cross section and Feature 2 was further exposed by troweling.

138 I SITEANALYSIS

Site Stratigraphy
Profiles of the clay veneer on the lower bench face revealed grayish brown blocky clays
approximately 30 cm in depth above a more compacted 10-20 cm layer of calcium
carbonate clays. Calcium carbonate clays overlie the mudstone substrata which are
exposed from the bench edge to the drainage banks.
Features

Three features were recorded at 41MC108. Features 1 and 2 are fire-cracked rock
features and Feature 3 is the chalcedony chipping station located during the 1985 survey
(Nightengale et ai. 1988:69).
FEATURE 1

Feature 1 is a dispersed grouping of fire-cracked sandstone, burned palmwood, and chert
cobbles exposed on the lower bench surface (Fig. 46). Each rock type is evenly disÂ­
tributed over an area of approximately 2 x 2 meters. The average size of sandstone pieces
is 3 cm3 with some ranging up to 10 cm in length by 2-4 em in thickness. Palmwood and
chert cobbles average about 5 cm in length. Dog leash Collection Unit 1 was placed over
the central portion of the feature. All burned rock within the collection unit and
peripheral fragments were mapped; total weight of feature components was 3175 gm. A
40 x 60 em cross section was excavated in the northwest portion of the collection unit,
determining that the cultural deposits extended 10 em below surface. No cultural
material was recovered from 10-20 cms below the surface. Vertical control was taken
from the central pin of the collection unit which was later recorded by transit. Only five
isolated pieces of fire-cracked sandstone with an average size of 4 cm in length, were
found at depths of 4-8 cm below surface. Soil samples were taken at 7-10 cm below
surface. No pit outline or charcoal staining were visible in the cross section profile and
only three tertiary chert flakes came from within the feature area.
FEATURE 2

Feature 2 is a tight cluster of 45 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone within an area of 65 x
65 cm on the western edge of the eroding clay bench in Area A (Fig. 47). Total weight of
the feature was 3628 gm. Hog rooting has disturbed a portion of the feature. After
mapping and collection of fire-cracked sandstone from the feature surface, trowelling of
the surface area determined that deposits were only 5 cm deep. No pit outline nor
charcoal staining was observed. One piece of baked clay was found on the northwest edge
of the feature. Unlike Feature 1 which contains large quantities of burned palmwood
and chert, Feature 2 contained only one piece of burned chert. No artifacts were
encountered in association with this feature. Fire-cracked sandstone observed on the
surface in most study area features and scatters averaged 3 cm3 ; the majority of pieces in

Feature 2 measure 5 cm in length by 4 cm in thickness suggesting a more intact hearth
rather than discards from features.
FEATURE 3
Feature 3 occupied a 2 x 4 meter area where debitage from a chalcedony flaking station
was recorded during the Phase II survey documentation of the site (Nightengale et al.
1988:69). The feature was located along the western edge of the eroding clay bench amid
the Area A concentration 15 meters southeast of Feature 1. During the survey, 34 flakes,
two preforms, and an unclassified serrated arrow point blade broken at mid stem were
collected (Nightengale et al. 1988:Fig. llx). During Phase III testing, 4 more chalcedony
flakes were found in the feature area bringing the total collection to 39 flakes. The full
range of lithic reduction is represented at this feature which is the most intact activity
locus recorded in the prospect (Nightengale et al. 1988:106). It also indicates a minimum
amount of horizontal movement from sheet erosion as flakes from all stages appear to
have been deposited in a discrete area used at one point during the Late Prehistoric
period.
Artifacts

The following lithic materials were recovered from 41MCI08: 77 cores, 9 thick bifaces,
51 thin bifaces, 5 distally beveled tools, 1 uniface, 8 trimmed flakes, 9 utilized flakes, 3
grinding slab fragments, 4 manos, 1 grooved abrader, and a few flakes and chips (Table
3). In most cases in the discussion below, only the groups and forms (as defined in the
Artifacts chapter) will be listed as they provide adequate descriptive information. The
more diagnostic artifacts (Le., projectile points, distally beveled tools, etc.) will be
described in detail along with information regarding chronological placement and
geographical distribution. Due to the nature of the sample, some of the groups and forms
are not represented at this site. Tables 4, 5, and 7 should be consulted for metric data and
material type for selected thick bifaces, thin bifaces, and distally beveled tools.

Group 1. Stemmed (5 specimens)
Form 2. Large with Contracting Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 190 This specimen is the proximal portion of an Angostura point
(Fig. 21n). This shoulderless point constricts to a narrow stem (1.2 cm) and
is widest near the midsection. The stem edges are ground (1.9 cm up from
the basal edge), as is the concave basal edge. Oblique, parallel flaking is
present.
Chronological Placement: Late Paleoindian, ca. 6500 B.C. to 6000 B.C.
(Thrner and Hester 1985:66).
Geographical Distribution: Occurs throughout Texas (ibid.).
Form 5. Small with Expanding Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 157: This Seal/om arrow point has wide side notches and a concave
basal edge (Fig. 22m).
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200
(Turner and Hester 1985:189).
Geographical Distribution: Occurs throughout most of Texas (ibid.)
Form 7. Unclassifiable Fragments of Small Stemmed Bifaces (2 specimens)
Specimen 113: This specimen is the distal fragment of an arrow point (Fig.
22t). A small portion of the neck remains and it appears that this point had
an expanding stem prior to breakage.
Specimen 184: This specimen is the medial section of an arrow point. The
lateral edges are serrated or notched (Fig. 22u), and this trait suggests that
this point was either an Edwards or Seallom arrow point. Serrated Edwards
and Seallorn arrow points have been recognized at several sites in south
Texas (Brown et aI. 1982:44; Highley n.d.), while serrated Perdiz points are

142 I SITEANALYSIS

rare or unknown. Brown et al. (ibid.) has observed that serrated arrow point
fragments from 41LK67 had evidence of use as cutting tools.
Form 8. Small with Straight Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 24: This small, well-made Alba arrow point has straight lateral edges;
both barbs are missing (Fig. 22y). The stem is parallel-edged and has a
straight basal edge.
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. A.D. 800 to A.D. 1200
(Turner and Hester 1985:163).
Geographical Distribution: Central Texas, east Texas, and the coastal plain
(ibid.).
Group 2. Unstemmed with Straight Bases (5 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (3 specimens)
Specimen 146: This Tortugas specimen has a straight basal edge, thinned base,
and slight alternate beveling of the lateral edges.
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period, and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985:152); Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399). Tortugas
points represented the most numerous point style recovered from 41LK28,
the Lorna Sandia site (Taylor and Highley n.d.). At 41LK28, Tortugas points
were radiocarbon dated to 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (ibid.).
Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and the Lower
Rio Grande; occasionally found in central Texas and the lower Pecos
(Turner and Hester 1985: 152).
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (2 specimens)
Specimen 57: This Tortugas fragment has a straight basal edge, thinned base,
and alternately beveled lateral edges.
(For chronological placement and geographical distribution, see Thin
Bifaces, Group 2, Form 1, Specimen 146).
Specimen 128: This Tortugas specimen has a straight basal edge, thinned base,
and alternately beveled lateral edges.
(For chronological placement and geographical distribution, see Thin
Bifaces, Group 2, Form 1, Specimen 146).
Group 3. Unstemmed with Concave Bases (2 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (2 specimens)
Specimen 25: This short triangular biface is made of silicified wood. It has
convex lateral edges and, prior to breakage, it probably had a straight basal
edge (Fig. 23g). The specimen exhibits minimal basal thinning. Although
somewhat similar to the smallest Tortugas points as defined by Highley
(n.d.), this specimen is not classified as a Tortugas point because of its
overall thinness and its lack of beveled edges. Specimen 25 is very similar
to Specimen 188.
Specimen 188: This small triangular biface has almost parallel lateral edges
that taper towards the distal tip (Fig. 23n). The specimen has been basally
thinned. The lower lateral edges (1.2 cm) and the basal edge have been
ground smooth.
Group 4. Unstemmed with Convex to Semicircular Bases (12 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (5 specimens)

41MC108 / 143

Specimen 10: This specimen has a semicircular thinned base (Fig. 231). The
thick blade exhibits a medial ridge on one face; thus, the biface is classified
as a Refugio point.
Chronological Placement: Archaic (Turner and Hester 1985:144). At
41LK.28, the Loma Sandia Site, a single Refugio point was found in the
cemetery zone which was radiocarbon dated to 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (Taylor
and Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: South Texas, the central coast, and the lower
Pecos (Turner and Hester 1985:144).
Specimen 118: This small, thick biface has a gently convex basal edge. It
exhibits minimal basal thinning and has been steeply chipped along the
lateral edges. Because of the overall thickness and the narrow width of this
specimen, it does not conform to the Tortugas point style.
Specimen 134: This small, thin biface probably represents an arrow point
preform, as has been suggested for similar specimens at many Late PrehisÂ­
toric sites (Highley et al. 1978:156; Black 1986b:76; Highley 1986:64, 109;
Highley n.d.).
Specimen 186: This large specimen is classified as a Refugio point. The
semicircular base has been thinned, while the blade portion of the specimen
remains thick.
(For chronological placement and geographical distribution, see Thin
Bifaces, Group 4, Form 1, Specimen 10).
Specimen 193: This triangular specimen has a convex basal edge; it is broken
along one lateral edge. Attempts were made to thin the basal portion of
the specimen. The distal portion is crudely flaked and the specimen is
probably a manufacturing failure or reject.
Form 4. Fragments with Convex to Semicircular Ends (7 specimens)
These specimens vary from thin and well-made to crudely flaked.
Group 8. Bifaces with Sharp, Slender Projections (1 specimen)
Specimen 53: This specimen is the medial portion of a perforator or drill. The
remaining portion of the distal end has parallel lateral sides with smoothed
edges; the distal tip is missing. The proximal portion had expanding lateral
edges; only a small portion of the proximal end remains.
Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (8 specimens). Most of the specimens are
well-made and probably represent finished tool forms. Beveling is present on
five of the bifaces; one specimen (#82) may represent the reworked blade of
a beveled knife.
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (18 specimens). These specimens range
from thin and well-made to crudely flaked. Specimen 72 exhibits parallel
flaking and is probab1y the midsection of a Paleoindian point.
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces (5 specimens)
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subrectangular (2 specimens)
Form 1. Triangular, Proximal End Pointed (2 specimens)
Specimen 9: This specimen is primarily unifacial; the proximal end has been
bifacially shaped, probably to facilitate hafting (Highley n.d.). The bit edge

144 I SITEANALYSIS

is straight and the left lateral edge exhibits smoothing. The dorsal face has
a pyramidal configuration.
Chronological Placement: These short, broad distally beveled tools date to
the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1985:205; Hall, Hester, and
Black 1986:399-400; Highley n.d.). At the Loma Sandia site, these tools
were associated with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (Taylor and
Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Common in south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:205; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:398-400).
Specimen 175: This bifacial tool has a straight distal edge. The dorsal face has
a pyramidal configuration.

Summary and Interpretations
Site 41MCI08 contains the cultural debris from multiple prehistoric campsites, comÂ­
ingled on exposures of weathered Jackson Group clays. The continually eroding clay
veneer undercuts artifacts and burned rock, redepositing them on a single surface. Only
Feature 3, the chalcedony chipping station, shows some stability over the past centuries.
Areas A and B are distinguished from the surrounding scatter primarily by concentrations
of lithic material and burned rock (Fig. 48). Although the two areas differ in elevation,
tool types and frequencies are similar, suggesting an overall consistency in activities
conducted on the bench and on the lobe. Elevation could reflect seasonality in occupaÂ­
tion, the higher lobe perhaps breezier, affording some protection from insect pests, and
providing a vantage point for observing game movements in the valley.

41MC360 /147

The ubiquitous scatter of burned rock found throughout the prospect sites usually
consists of small, fire-fractured pieces reduced beneath usable size. The two fire-cracked
sandstone features identified at 41MC108 were composed of relatively large fragments,
suggesting that they were only slightly disturbed hearths. The site lacked outcrops
suitable for the procurement of hearth stones; the nearest identified sources are 4lMC75
and 41MC357, both approximately 1 km from 4lMC108.
Lithic reduction took place in both Area A and B. Transport of chert raw material to the
site for initial reduction is evidenced by three tested cobbles. The nine thick bifaces
recovered are evenly distributed across the site and indicate some primary reduction took
place. Secondary reduction is apparent in the thin bifaces and fragments, preforms, and
manufacturing failures (Group 1-4 and 8-10) also found in similar frequencies in both
areas. The Feature 3 chalcedony chipping station is a discrete, datable primary and
secondary reduction area. Chalcedony co-occurs with chert cobbles in La J arita Creek.
The arrow point blade found in Feature 3 is serrated, a characteristic of both Scallom or
Edwards types.
Special purpose tools collected at 41MC108 emphasis the range of domestic and mainÂ­
tenance activities that possibly took place - projectile points (hunting, cutting), grinding
slabs (food processing), gouges (wood-working), perforators (hide-working), a hamÂ­
merstone (battering), scrapers, and knives (Hester, Gilbow and Albee 1973; Brown, et al.
1982:65-74). High frequencies of cores suggest the use of expediency tools for scraping
and cutting.
41MC108 was apparently a favored camping site throughout prehistory. The Late
Paleoindian Angostura point may have been a scavenged artifact, brought to the site by
later inhabitants but the intensity of Archaic occupation is reflected by numerous dart
points attributable to the South Texas Middle and Late Archaic tool kit. The Late
Prehistoric period is also represented by three arrow point fragments and the chalcedony
chipping station.
41MC360

Introduction

41MC360 occupies two adjoining knoll tops separated by 100 meters of lower relief
(Fig. 49). Set atop a long southwest trending interfluvial divide, the location offers access
to valleys, formed by primary tributaries of Hog Creek, on the southeast and on the
northwest. Based on the horizontal distribution of observed cultural material, site size
was estimated at 54,000 square meters. Elevation at primary datum is 105 meters msl,
decreasing to 104 meters msl in the swale between the knoll tops. The upland vegetation
is remnant open grass savannah coexisting with thorny brush and cacti. Scattered
mesquite comprise the predominant overstory. The knoll tops are fairly open but the
slopes are covered with dense brush. Soils are weathered Jackson Group clays over
sandstone substrates.

41MC360 I 149

Disturbances to the integrity of cultural deposits are mainly the result of sendero clearing
and subsequent erosion. Two senderos, one along the east edge of each knoll top, have
exposed quantities of cultural debris. This is most apparent along the east edge of the
east knoll, designated Area A. There, a very high density of fire-cracked sandstone and
artifacts lay exposed from sendero blading through a heavily utilized occupation area.
Other types of disturbance stem from hog rooting holes, erosion, and animal burrows.
These have acted as both a detriment and advantage since they have helped expose more
material to surface investigation.
Previous Research

The site was classified in the multiple function upland divide category, in 1985 as part of
the extended San Miguel Lignite Prospect Survey (Nightengale et al. 1988). The majority
of material was observed along the east edge of the Area A knoll in the sendero. By
contrast, the Area B knoll to west contained fewer artifacts. Primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes, initial and secondary stage bifaces, several utilized flakes, unifaces, and
burned rock were observed over a 64,000 square meters area. Lithics were primarily
chert, with some chalcedony and palmwood. Select surface collection included nine thin
bifaces (Groups 1, 2, and 4), two distally beveled tools (Groups 3 and 7), one uniface
(Group 5), and two trimmed flakes (Groups 3 and 4). Temporally diagnostics tool types
suggested occupations during the Early and Middle Archaic in both areas.
Testing Methods

Methods used to assess the horizontal distribution of cultural material were primarily 4Â­
and 2-meter wide transects by four crew members. Each pin flagged artifact was transit
mapped, given a unique field number, and collected. One dog leash collection unit was
placed over Feature 1. Cultural material was sampled by imposing a 35 x 35 meter grid
of 5 meter square units in Area A (Fig. 49, Table 12). The grid was oriented along the
sendero so as to adequately sample both the upper and lower slopes in the densest area
of concentration. The odd numbered east-west column in line with the slope and two
north-south rows paralleling the sendero - one on the upper slope and one on the lower
slope-were collected. Those squares in the northern most part of the grid were not
sampled because of dense vegetation. In all, material from 27 of 49 squares was collected.
Burned rock, which included fire-cracked sandstone, burned chert, and palmwood, was
counted, measured, recorded by material type, and weighed. All tools, cores, and fragÂ­
ments were mapped in by transit and taped from a primary datum established at
approximately the center of the grid. Ten 50 x 50 cm diameter shovel probes excavated
in 10 em levels were used to assess the vertical distribution of cultural material. Probes
were placed along the upper slope "N' row and three other selected units - D2, D4, and
F3. Matrix was sifted through 1/4 inch mesh screens and hand picked.

Site Stratigraphy

Stratigraphy is based on the ten shovel probes placed in the Area A grid only. The "I\.'
row probes assessed the crest of the slope, those in the "D" row assessed the mid-slope,
and the one in F3 assessed the lower slope deposits. The depth of clay sediments ranged

41MC360 I 151

from 60 cm to bedrock exposures of the Jackson Group. The deepest probes reflect the
accumulation of bladed earth from sendero clearing. The clays are not residual soils but
bedrock clays formed in part from eolian lagoonal sands during the Eocene; hence, the
surfaces have been constant for millennium with little to no soil development. Artifacts
deposited on the surfaces have not been covered by alluvial or colluvial processes. The
main disturbance to the integrity of the surface deposits has been the constant shrinking
and swelling of the clays when artifacts fall into cracks and are subsequently buried.
The following description is from probes along the ''Ai.' row and unit F3.
Zone 1 (0-30 cm). Very dark gray blocky clays (Munsell10YR3/1 dry). Cultural material
was found in the upper 20 cm and concentrated in the upper 10 cm.
Zone 2 (30 cm). Very compact dark gray blocky clay with dense calcium carbonate
mottling (Munsell lOYR4/1 dry).
The following is from probes in units D2 and D4.
Zone 1 (0-20 cm). Very dark gray blocky clays with minimal calcium carbonate content
(Munsell 10YR3/1 dry). Cultural material was found in the upper 10 cm. Mussel shell
fragments were found in Levell of Probe 8 and Level 2 of Probe 10.
Zone 2 (20-60 cm). Dark grayish brown clay. More friable with increasing calcium
carbonate mottling and becoming more compact with depth. Only isolated pieces of
cultural material were observed. Mussel shell fragments were found in Level 3 of Probes
8 and 10. Animal bone was noted in Levels 4 through 6 in Probe 10. Probe 8 was
terminated at 40 cm and Probe 10 at 60 cm, when the compact calcium carbonate zone
was encountered.
Soil samples were taken from various levels in Probes 2, 4, and 8. Only the Level 4 sample
from Probe 8 was submitted for phytolith analysis.
Features and Burned Rock Concentrations

Three features and seven burned rock concentrations were documented at 41MC360.
The main feature, Feature 3, is a large discrete burned rock cluster within Area A. The
two other features are small burned rock clusters recorded on the lower eastern slopes.
The seven burned rock concentrations are hog hole and animal burrow exposures in Area
B. None of the concentrations are discrete enough to warrant feature status.
FEATUREl

Feature 1 is a small 2 square meters area of fire-cracked sandstone and, to a lesser extent,
burned palmwood (Fig. 50). A dog leash collection unit was placed over the feature which
consists of 22 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone, weighing approximately 815 grams. The
average size of component rocks is 3 cm3. The feature was eroding from the upper 5 cm

of clay onto a denuded surface with high calcium carbonate content but the relative
compactness ofthe feature suggests recent exposure. Cultural debris from the collection
unit consisted of one secondary and three tertiary chert flakes and four chips. AMorhiss
dart point was found on the southwest edge of the feature.
FEATURE 2

Feature 2 is a 10- x lO-meter area of dispersed burned rock located approximatel 110
meters south of Feature 1. Fire-cracked sandstone pieces measuring between 3 cm1and
3 x 5 cm lie atop eroded exposures and within 5 em of clay retained by the roots of grassy
clumps. The feature appears to be eroding from the upper 5 em of clay. One thin biface
(Group 9) and a secondary flake were collected from the feature area.
FEATURE 3

Feature 3 is a large concentration of burned rock scattered on the surface and within the
upper 10 em of matrix in Area A. Morphologically, the feature is a thick broken
pavement, not a mound. About 80% of the burned rock ranged in size from 3 cm3 to 5
x 5 em with several pieces measuring 10 x 5 x 5 cm. Fifteen percent of the fire-cracked
rock was burned chert and 5% was palmwood. Weight from all collected units was 70 kg.

41MC360 I 153

Most of the burned rock comes from the north-south rows along the crest where the
sendero was bladed. A large quantity of tools, cores, and flakes were collected from this
feature area.
BURNED ROCK CONCENTRATIONS
Seven localities in Area B are exposures of burned rock ranging in size from 60 cm to 7
meters in diameter. Some lie on erosional surfaces on the slopes and crests of the knoll
while others have been exposed by burrowing animals and rooting feral hogs. The largest
concentration is fire-cracked sandstone dispersed on the north slope of the knoll but
probably redeposited from the crests. The remaining six concentrations, on the ed~es of
the knoll, consist of 5 to 8 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone measuring between 3 cm and
5 x 5 cm.

Artifacts

The following lithic materials were recovered from 41MC360: 163 cores, 13 thick bifaces,
63 thin bifaces, 9 distally beveled tools, 6 unifaces, 9 trimmed flakes, 21 utilized flakes
and chips, 7 grinding slab fragments, 1 mano, 1 grooved abrader, and 1557 flakes and
chips (Table 3). In most cases in the discussion below, only the groups and forms (as
defined in the Artifact chapter) will be listed as they provide adequate descriptive
information. Due to the select nature of the sample, several of the groups and forms of
artifacts are not represented at this site. The more diagnostic artifacts (Le., projectile
points and other thin bifaces, distally beveled tools, etc.) will be described in detail.
Discussion of time diagnostic forms will include chronological placement as well as
information regarding geographical distribution. Metric data and material type for
selected thick bifaces, thin bifaces, and distally beveled bifaces are provided in Tables
4-7.

Group 1. Stemmed (8 specimens)
Form 1. Large with Straight Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 251: Though missing its extreme basal edge, this point is identified
as a Morhiss dart point (Fig. 21c). The large, thick blade has convex lateral
edge and has been alternately beveled along the left edges. Slight shoulders
are present. The stem edges are straight and, at the break, one edge begins
to curve inward suggesting a convex basal edge.
Chronological Placement: Late Archaic, ca. 800 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1985:127); late Middle Archaic, ca. 850 B.C. to 600 B.c., at 41LK28, the
Lorna Sandia site (Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Primarily on the lower reaches of the
Guadalupe River in the upper part of the central coastal plain (Turner and
Hester 1985:127), but also occasionally found in south Texas (Highley n.d.).
Form 2. Large with Contracting Stems (1 specimen)
Specimen 91: This Langtry point has a short wide blade with barbs and a stem
that contracts to a somewhat rounded point (Fig. 21i). It has been noted by
Turner and Hester (1985:114), Hall, Black, and Graves (1982:288), and
Hall, Hester, and Black (1986:263) that considerable variation among size,
base shape, and development of shoulders occurs from region to region.
Hall, Hester, and Black (1986:263) have suggested specimens from the
Choke Canyon are regional variants of the classic Langtry form.
Chronological Placement: ca. 2500 B.C. to 1000 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1985:114).
Geographical Distribution: Most common in the lower Pecos; occasionally
found in south and south central Texas, the Big Bend area, and Coahuila,
Mexico (ibid.). In south Texas, specimens are reported from the Choke
Canyon region (Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:288; Hall, Hester, and Black
1986:263), the Lorna Sandia Site (Highley n.d.), and from surface collecÂ­
tions in McMullen County (Woerner and Highley 1983:13).

Form 3. Large with Expanding Stems (3 specimens)
Specimen 63: This large, wide expanding stem dart point does not fit into
existing dart point typologies (Fig. 21n). The distal portion of the point is
missing and the remaining portion has generally parallel edges. Short, wide
side-notches have produced expanding stem edges. The basal edge is
broadly concave.
Specimen 70: This small point is classified as an Ensor point. Short, narrow
side-notches have produced an expanding stem as wide as the blade (Fig.
210). The basal edge is straight. The blade is alternately beveled along
right edges.
Chronological Placement: Transitional Archaic, ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 600
(Turner and Hester 1985:94); Late Archaic, ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 900 (Hall,
Hester, and Black 1986:400-401). Ensor points were recovered from Late
Archaic context at 41LK28, the Lorna Sandia site (Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Throughout central and south Texas (Turner
and Hester 1985:94).
Specimen 129: This Fairland dart point has a long blade with convex lateral
edges; wide, shallow notches have produced an expanding stem (Fig. 21p).
The basal edge is broadly concave. The upper one-third of the specimen
has been alternately beveled along the left edges.
Chronological Placement: Transitional Archaic (Turner and Hester
1985:996); Late Archaic, ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 900 (Hall, Hester, and Black
1986:400-401). Specimens were also recovered from Late Archaic context
at the Lorna Sandia site, 41LK28 (Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Central and south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:96; Woerner and Highley 1983:11; Hall, Black, and Graves 1982:284,
289-290; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:258, 263; Highley n.d.)
Form 5. Small with Expanding Stems (2 specimens)
Specimen 80: This proximal fragment is the stem of a Scallorn arrow point
(Fig. 22n). The specimen has an expanding stem and a straight basal edge.
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200
(Turner and Hester 1985:189); ca. A.D. 900 to A. D. 1400 (Hall, Hester, and
Black 1986:403).
Geographical Distribution: Throughout Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:189).
Specimen 214: This arrow point is classified as an Edwards point based on its
flaring stem with downturned stem corners and concave basal edge (Fig.
220). The specimen is thin and very well made.
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. A.D. 960 to A.D. 1040
(Turner and Hester 1985:173); ca. A.D. 900 to A.D. 1400 (Hall, Hester, and
Black 1986:403).
Geographical Distribution: South central Texas and into the south Texas
coastal plain (Turner and Hester 1985:173)
Form 7. Unclassifiable Fragments of Small Stemmed Bifaces (1 specimen)
Specimen 85: This specimen is the distal portion of an arrow point (Fig. 22v).
Group 2. Unstemmed with Straight Bases (5 specimens)

156 I SITEANALYSIS

Form 2. Proximal Fragments (5 specimens)
Specimens 55, 72, and 117 are crudely flaked and probably represent preforms.
All have been basally thinned.
Specimens 79 and 150: These two narrow fragments are very thin and wellÂ­
made. They probably represent arrow point preforms and are similar to
specimens recovered from other Late Prehistoric sites (Highley et al.
1978:156; Highley 1986:64, 109; Black 1986b:76; Highley n.d.).
Group 3. Unstemmed with Concave Bases (3 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (1 specimen)
Specimen 185: This small, narrow biface has alternately beveled lateral edges
with the beveling beginning near the basal edge (Fig. 23i). The basal edge
is slightly concave. The basal portion of the specimen has been thinned,
while the midsection is thick.
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (2 specimens)
Specimen 143: This proximal fragment has been basally thinned. Beveling is
not present.
Specimen 321: This specimen has been basally thinned and has alternately
beveled edges; thus, it is classified as a Tortugas point.
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985: 152). Tortugas points were associated with the late
Middle Archaic cemetery zone at the Loma Sandia site, with radiocarbon
dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (ibid.).
Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and the lower Rio
Grande; occasionally found in central Texas and the lower Pecos (Turner
and Hester 1985:152).
Group 4. Unstemmed with Convex to Semicircular Bases (11 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (2 specimens)
Specimen 168: This small specimen with a convex basal edge has been
fashioned from chalcedony. It probably represents a manufacturing failure
as a large knot could not be removed from one face.
Specimen 264: This large specimen has a semicircular base. It probably
represents a preform.
Form 4. Fragments with Convex to Semicircular Bases (9 specimens). These
specimens show varying degrees of thinness and symmetry.
Group 5. Unstemmed Leaf Shaped (3 specimens). These specimens are ovate or
leaf-shaped in outline; they exhibit varying degrees of thinness and symmetry
(Fig. 24e-g).
Group 8. Bifaces with Sharp, Slender Projections (2 specimens)
Specimen 139: This drill/perforator has been made on an Angostura point. The
proximal portion of the specimen expands upward from the basal edge (Fig.
241). The basal edge is only slightly concave. Both the lateral and basal
edges have been ground smooth. The drill bit has been crudely flaked from
one face only.
Chronological Placement: Angostura points date to ca. 6500 B.C. to 6000
B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:66-67); however, given the crude workmanÂ­
ship on the drill bit it is likely that this point was recycled by later people.

41MC360 / 157

Geographical Distribution: throughout most of Texas (ibid.).
Specimen 211: This tool is also a drill/perforator made on anAngostura point (Fig.
24m). The proximal end expands upward from the basal edge. The basal
edge is slightly concave. One lateral edge has been heavily ground while
the other edge has been slightly ground. The drill bit has been worked
bifacially with very careful flaking similar to the type of flaking present on
the proximal portion of the specimen; thus, it is possible that this point was
reworked by Late Paleoindian people.
Chronological Placement: ca. 6500 B.C. to 6000 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1985: 66-67).
Geographical Distribution: Throughout most of Texas (ibid.).
Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (12 specimens). The majority of these
specimens appear to be the distal ends of manufacturing failures or preforms;
however, Specimens 33 and 190 may be the distal ends of finished tool forms.
In addition to these, Specimen 247 exhibits parallel flaking, a characteristic of
Paleo indian specimens.
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (19 specimens)
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces (9 specimens)
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subrectangular (1 specimen)
Form 2. Triangular, Proximal End Rounded (1 specimen)
Specimen 167: This bifacial specimen is uniformally thin; it does not exhibit
the pyramidal configuration generally present on Group 3, Forms 1 and 2
specimens. The bit edge is slightly convex. The lower lateral edges have
been smoothed, perhaps to facilitate hafting.
Chronological Placement: Small distally beveled tools (Groups 3 and 4)
date to the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1985:205; Hester,
Hall, and Black 1986:399-400; Highley n.d.). At 41LK28, the Lorna Sandia
site, these tool forms were associated with deposits radiocarbon dated to
850 B.C. to 600 B.C. and coÂ·occurred with Abasolo, Lange, Morhiss, and
Tortugas points (Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Common in south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985: 205; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:398-400; Highley n.d.).
Group 4. Small, Triangular to Subtriangular (1 specimen)
Specimen 69: This subtriangular specimen has a convex-edged bit that is missing
its left corner. The specimen is bifacial.
Chronological Placement: Group 4 specimens have been associated with
the Middle Archaic period (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399-400; Highley
n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Common in south Texas (Turner and Hester

Group 7. Various Forms with Broad, Rounded, Low-Angle Bevels (2 specimens)
Form 1. Elongate, Elliptical to Subrectangular (2 specimens)
Specimen 180: This large, thick, crudely flaked specimen has a low-angle bit
edge that is convex. The lower lateral edges have been smoothed.

158 / SITE ANALYSIS

Specimen 272: This plano-convex specimen has a low angle bit with a convex
edge. A patch of corte:x remains on the dorsal face. One lateral edge
exhibits smoothing along the proximal half of the. specimen.
Group 9. Distal Fragments (4 specimens) These four bifacial specimens represent
the bit fragments from groups described above. Specimen 98 is definitely a
Group 3 tool but the proximal end is missing. and thus. it could not be placed
in Form 1 or Form 2.
Group 10. Proximal Fragments (1 specimen)
Specimen 166: This bifacial palmwood specimen appears to represent the
proximal end of a gouge whose bit has been removed by hard percussion
(Fig. 27j). The bit was removed by striking a blow to the central portion of
the bit edge. Highley (n.d.) speculates that this technique would remove an
exhausted bit edge and allow for the shaping of a new bit edge.

Shovel Probe 8, LevelS, numerous pieces of rodent-size bone and deer phalanÂ­
ges.

A mussel shell fragment found on the surface of Unit F2 was identified as Uniomerus
declivus a species of freshwater bivalve typically found in temporary streams, backwater
sloughs, and pools that periodically go dry (see Appendix 3). Snail shell from the surface
of Unit F5 was identified as Polygyra texasiana, a terrestrial gastropod found in seasonally
moist woodlands or in areas with sandy soil; this species survives in more brushy habitats
when sufficient downed wood provides shelter during periods of drought.
Flora

Analysis of soil samples from Level 4 (30-40 em) of Shovel Probe 8 for presence of
phytoliths resulted in the identification of equivalent percentages of Panicoid grasses
characteristic of mesic grasslands with summer rainfall and Chloridoid grasses associated
with arid environments with summer rainfall and warm environments.

160 / SITE ANALYSIS

Summary and Interpretations

Two areas of concentrated cultural material were defined atop knolls separated by a swale
that channels runoff north and south into headwater tributaries of Hog Creek. Some
functional differences could be discerned from classification of the collected artifacts
into the three categories of all, diagnostic, and discard and plotting their distribution on
computer-generated maps (Fig. 51a-c).
Three burned rock features were defined in Area A. Features 1 and 2 are isolated hearths
associated with sparse lithic debris. Feature 3 is a large cluster of fire-cracked sandstone,
burned chert, and palmwood that has accumulated over an area of approximately 25 x
35 meters to a depth of 10 cm. Included within the cluster was a large inventory of lithic
debris from all the defined classes of artifacts. The proportion of discard class artifacts
and the distribution of burned rock over such a large area suggests that Feature 3 is the
accumulated debris from multiple knoll top encampments.
The seven burned rock accumulations recorded in Area B lack the integrity of the
features in Area A. Fringing the knoll top, these exposures of fire-cracked sandstone on
the eroded slopes are probably redeposited from the crests. The lithic materials
recovered from Area B also ring the high point of the knoll. Although the Area B artifact
inventory contained some artifact types comparable to Area A, the overall density of
lithics and burned rock was significantly less (Table 13).
The quantity of fire-cracked sandstone littering the site must have been acquired from a
dependable source. The only surficial exposures of raw material suitable for hearth
stones and grinding implements are a sandstone boulder and tabular fragments produced
by excavating a pipeline west of Area B. The nearest recorded sandstone outcrop is
approximately 700 meters to the north on the eastern slopes of 41AT75. Hearth comÂ­
ponents were either carried to the site or procured from boulders and outcrops now
depleted. Thus, factors other than the availibility of sandstone prompted the occupation
of 41MC360.
A small supply of lithic raw material for stone tool manufacture was available in the swale
between the knoll tops where scattered erosional siliceous gravels contain pea- to fist-size
cherts, palmwood, and purple quartzites. Large unmodified cobbles collected from both
areas of 41MC360 are similar in size to chert nodules available in the La Jarita Creek
procurement area. The on-site gravel deposits were probably easily depleted and it was
more efficient to transport larger, more workable cobbles procured from the La Jarita
Creek gravels.
Overall, the low frequency of thick bifaces and the high frequency of cores and utilized
debitage suggest the manufacture of expediency tools for immediate use in both areas.
The majority of the cores (N = 81) and debitage and all the broken preforms and
manufacturing failures were recovered from Area A. Formal tools, including thick and
thin bifaces, unifaces, projectile points, and grinding slab fragments, were also more
common in Area A.

The density and variety of cultural material in Area A may be attributable to the long
range of occupation indicated by temporally diagnostic projectile points and tools.
DrilVperforators reworked from Angostura points are not uncommon in south Texas
assemblages although finding two on one site is rare. One possible explaination is the
these Late Paleoindian artifacts were introduced to the site by later occupants. Early,

41MC362 I 163

Middle and Late Archaic dart points and Late Prehistoric arrow points show the repeated
use of Area A throughout prehistory. Two specimens of Early and Middle Archaic age
were recovered from Area B but the assemblage is so small that sampling error could
easily account for the absence of later tool types.
In summary, Area A of 41MC360 was apparently intermittently occupied over thousands
of years. The site extended onto Area B to a much lesser degree for reasons unspecified
in the archeological assemblage. The knoll top concentrations reflect a preference for
elevated locations where cultural material was redeposited on the fringes by erosion.
41MC362

Introduction

41MC362 is located on a 30 x 10 meter natural levee along the left bank terrace of La
Jarita Creek (Fig. 52). The levee, a natural accumulation of fluvially redeposited clays,
rises approximately 50 cm above the surrounding floodplain and consists of silts and clay,
deposited on an already existing high point. To the southwest, between the levee and La
Jarita Creek, a relict chute channel or swale, formed during high magnitude discharge
from La Jarita Creek, was identified from surface observation and in the wall of Backhoe
Trench 2 where several flood sequences were isolated in profile. Two erosional channels
dissect the levee between Test Pit 2 and Backhoe Trench 3, isolating a segment that has
been subjected to further surface erosion and deep animal burrowing. These disturbanÂ­
ces eliminated that area of the site from testing. Phase III subsurface investigations were
confined to the portion of the levee where animal burrowing and surface erosion have
been somewhat retarded by tree cover. Elevation ranges from 87.5 meters MSL at
primary datum to 88 meters at the high point of the main portion of the levee. Vegetation
varies from open short grassy areas along the upper and lower terraces east of the levee
to moderately dense riparian growth along the levee and creek bank to the west (Fig. 35b).
A stand of young trees grows on the levee. Tall ash trees constitute a portion of the
overs tory growth west of the site. Soils, discussed in more detail below, are alluvial clays
that have been redeposited from upland areas.
Previous Research

41MC362 was one of three limited function valley sites recorded during Phase II survey
of the extended San Miguel Lignite Prospect (Nightengale et al. 1988:52-53). Two shovel
probes were used to assess the vertical distribution of cultural material in exposures along
the east edge and atop the levee. A burned rock feature, mussel and snail shell, flakes,
and a core (Group 4) were recorded in a probe near the eastern edge of the site. Cultural
material reached 55 cm in depth with concentrations in the upper 10 to 15 cm. Other
artifacts observed on the levee surface included a thin scatter of secondary and tertiary
chert flakes and one thin biface and one thick biface, both of chert. Only one chert uniface
(Group 4) with undetermined use-wear was collected at that time. Based on the horizonÂ­

tal distribution of cultural debris, site size was established at 1,400 square meters. No
temporal diagnostics were observed during Phase II documentation.
Testing Methods

Guided by the information gained in Phase II shovel probing, two 1 x 2 meter test pits
were placed on the main portion of the levee in the least disturbed area. One 1 x 1 meter
test unit tested the deposits on the southeastern periphery. All units were excavated in
10 em arbitrary levels and the matrix was water-screened through 1/4 in. mesh. Four
backhoe trenches, between 3.5 and 6 meters in length, were used to assess the site
stratigraphy (see Caran, this report).
Site Stratigraphy

Soil deposition at 41MC362 is reconstructed from test pit and backhoe trench profiles
(Fig. 53). The flood sequences displayed in the Backhoe Trench 1 are described on the
profile. Zones vary in thickness across the site. A more detailed discussion is provided
in Chapter 3.
ZONE I

Zone I is a dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) blocky silty clay with rootlets and insect
burrows. Overlying this zone is a Â± 2 em thick humic zone. Thickness ranges from 15 em
in Backhoe Trench 3 to a maximum of 40 em in Test Pits 1 and 2. The highest frequency
of cultural material was recovered from the lower 30 em in Test Pits 1 and 2.
ZONE II

Zone II is a very dark gray (10YR3/l) silty clay with calcium carbonate mottling. In most
profiles, this zone is transitional; calcium carbonate mottling is present but to a lesser
degree than in the underlying zone. The thickness of the zone generally ranges from
10-15 em except in Backhoe Trench 3 where it was absent. Cultural material content
within the zone is notably diminished.
ZONE III

Zone III is a dark gray (lOYR4/l) silty clay with dense calcium carbonate mottling.
Present in most profiles, it is culturally sterile and signaled the end of excavation in hand
excavated units.

ZONE IV

Zone IV is present in profile from Backhoe Trench 3 only begining 135 cm below surface.
This light brownish gray (10YR6/2-dry) silty clay with minimal calcium carbonate motÂ­
tling is an example of the underlying paleosol developed on weathered Jackson GroupÂ·
mudstone. No cultural material was observed within the exposed portion of the zone.
Features

Only one intact subsurface feature was documented during Phase III investigations at
41MC362 although the presence of others may be presumed from a similar hearth noted
during the survey pahse (Nightengale et at. 1988:53).
Feature 1, a cluster of 21 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone, weighing 1.1 kg, was isolated
in the southeast portion ofTest Pit 1 resting on surfaces between 20-25 cm (Level 3) below
datum (Fig. 54). The majority of pieces lay between 22-25 cm. Just below the feature,
another more dispersed group of 22 pieces of fire-cracked sandstone, weighing 2 kg,
rested between 26-30 cm (also Level 3) below datum with a concentration at 30 cm. This
second group was dispersed across the entire unit level. Both consisted mainly of
fire-fractured sandstone pieces measuring between 3 and 5 cm3.
Associated with Feature 1 were a flake concentration and a Tortugas dart point (Thin
Biface Group 2, Form 1) at Â± 20 cm. The flake concentration was located in the east
central portion of the unit; the Tortugas was found in the southeast corner. High
frequencies of debitage, snail, and bone were recovered from Level 3. Many of the flakes
in Levels 2 and 3 were burned. Whole and fragmentary mussel shell were collected from
21 cm below datum. Correspondingly high frequencies of similar types of cultural debris
were recovered from Level 3 in Test Pit 2.
A radiocarbon sample of charcoal and burned earth collected from a 8- x 8-cm area, at
between 25-28 cm below datum in Test Pit 2. The result was a radiocarbon age of 1560
Â± 220; A.D. 390 (TX 6095), with a calibrated 2 sigma range of 87 B.C. to A.D. 943 (Stuiver
and Becker 1986), which is within the Late Archaic period. Temporally diagnostic tool
types, a Tortugas dart point and a distally bevealed biface were both of Middle Archaic
age. Some mixing from floods and reoccupation by returning groups is apparent from
the mixed distribution of cultural material and the dispersed nature of the fire-cracked
sandstone. Therefore, minimal confidence can be attributed to the integrity of deposits
in the upper 40 cm of either unit.
Artifacts

The following lithics were recovered from 41MC362: 5 cores, 2 thick bifaces, 2 thin
bifaces, 1 distally beveled tool, 1 uniface, 1 trimmed flake, 1 utilized flake, and 1194 flakes
and chips (Table 3). In the discussion below, only the groups and forms (as defined in
the Artifacts chapter) will be listed as they provide adequate descriptive information.

edges and a straight basal edge. The specimen is classified as a Tortugas
point.
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985:152; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399). Tortugas
points were associated with the late Middle Archaic cemetery zone at the
Lorna Sandia site, with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (Taylor and
Highley n.d.).
Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and the lower Rio

Vertebrate and Molluscan Fauna

Riverine molluscan and vertebrate faunal remains were recovered from excavated test
pits (Table 14).
Flora

Phytoliths identified in samples from Test Pit 1, the lower levels, indicate a dominantly
arid environment (Table 14).
Summary and Interpretations

41MC362 occupies a natural levee along the left bank terraces of La Jarita Creek. The
levee has been formed from alluvial clays redeposited during numerous flood and
erosional sequences associated with La Jarita creek. Two relict chutes of La Jarita Creek
were identified east and west of the levee. The clay vertisols that make up the upper
cultural bearing zones provided a poor depositional environment for discrete prehistoric
occupations. The cultural zone at 41MC362 ranged from 10-40 cm with some material
extending as deep as 50-60 cm (Table 15). This stratum was marked by fire-cracked
sandstone, burned clay lumps, lithic debitage, tools, and faunal remains, all evidence of
the varied activities carried out at the site. Sandstone hearth stones were procured from
nearby outcrops, possibly those at 41MC363, 100 meters to the northeast. Chert raw
material for stone tool production was readily available in La Jarita Creek. Only one
broken chert cobble was recovered and the absence of large flakes and thick bifaces
suggests primary reduction was not a major activity at the site. Higher frequencies of
small flakes and cores are more indicative of later stage reduction and tool resharpening.
Utilized flakes and cores in the lower levels of the cultural zone are more likely the
product of expediency tool manufacture. Only three formal tools were recovered from
the test units. The two distally beveled tools may well have been used to process wood
from the nearby riparian community (Hester, Gilbow, and Albee 1973).
The distally beveled biface (Group 3, Form 2) and Tortugas dart point are generally
considered Middle Archaic in age. Charcoal and burned earth collected from between
25-28 cm in Test Pit 2 was radiocarbon assayed and rendered a corrected 2-sigma date of
85 B.C. and A.D. 943 during the Late Archaic Period in the local chronology. The charcoal
sample was not clearly associated with intact features and the recovery of organics
suitable for dating and temporally diagnostic artifacts is too limited to recreate an
occupational sequence at the site.
The recovery of phytoliths and molluscan fauna permits some reconstruction of the
prehistoric environment. All the molluscan species identified normally flourish in perÂ­

manent dependable water sources, unlike the intermittent streams that characterize the
region today. The bulk of the sample was collected from approximately the same depth
as the charcoal and burned earth that produced a Late Archaic date. Phytoliths recovered
from the lower cultural zones and below suggest an environment more prone to summer
rains. The possibility remains that the phytoliths were alluvially redeposited and they
should be viewed conservatively.
41MC362 yielded the largest sample, 272 pieces, of faunal remains recovered during the
testing program. The fragmentary condition of the bone, burned and unburned, limited
identification to rabbit-sized and deer-sized mammals. Freshwater bivalves, snails, and
turtle are other components of human diet evidenced at 41MC362. Fragments of turtle
carapace were unfortunately not species-specific (Winans, personal communication,
1988). The numerous Rabdotus shells in the cultural deposits were largely adult
specimens, perhaps collected during foraging episodes.
The inhabitants of 41MC362 practiced a broad spectrum procurement strategy from this
optimal levee location, close to lithic and riverine resources and adjacent to a then-deÂ­
pendable water source. Much larger sites (41MC363 and 41MC106) flank 41MC362 on
the northeast and northwest suggesting that the latter may have been simply an alternate
location intermittently used for the same general purposes, exploitation of the riverine
zone. The proximity to water with the potential for flooding dictates that occupation was
sporadic and probably seasonal during periods of low rainfall.
41MC363

Introduction

Located on the western end of a west-trending interfluvial lobe, 41MC363 overlooks a
flat, grassy flood plain above the confluences of La Jarita Creek, Hog Creek, and one of
its unnamed tributaries 380 meters to the west (Fig. 55). The northern and northwestern
slopes of the site form the banks of the primary tributary; the western and southwestern
slopes are the valley margins of La Jarita Creek. The site extends on to a wide, flat relict
terrace adjacent to the fossil flood plain of La Jarita Creek. Elevation ranges from 89
meters mean sea level on the terrace to 97 meters mean sea level on the most heavily
utilized site area.
Scattered clusters of thorny brush and prickly pear fringe open grassy clearings on the
upper portions of the site (Fig. 35c). Mesquite trees, the dominant overstory, grow east
and northeast of the primary site area but not on the western side. A band of brush circling
the upper western slopes is virtually impenetrable. Clump grasses grow amid the thorny
brush over most of the site; on the lower slopes pronounced erosion has swept away all
but the most firmly rooted clumps, leaving large open denuded clay surfaces.

Previous Research

41MC363 was recorded as a multifunctional, valley site during the 1985 survey (NightenÂ­
gale et al. 1988:53-55). A dense scatter of lithic debris and burned rock extended across
approximately 225,000 square meters. Concentrations of cultural material were isolated
in four areas amid the overall scatter. Areas 1 (now Area B), 2 and 4 (now Area A) were
mapped on the western crests., and Area 3 (now Area D) on the lower margins. Area C
was added to accomodate a fourth concentration on the southeastern slope. Dense
surface scatters of burned rock, flakes, cores, and tools, including thick and thin bifaces,
distally bevelled tools, utilized flakes and a hammerstone, defined Areas 1-3. A mussel
shell fragment from Area 2 was identified as Crytonaias tampicoensis, a species found in
permanent flowing water sources rather than the intermittent streams typical of the
modern environment. Area 4 was a concentration of thin biface fragments from seconÂ­
dary stages of reduction. Temporally diagnostic artifacts reflect Middle Archaic
occupations and a possible Late Prehistoric component.
Testing Methods

Transects and pin flagging were used to identify areas of concentration and to
provenience collected artifacts. Four flake transects (one in Area A, one in Area C, and
two in Area D), sampled debitage in 4 x 25 m linear corridors. Hand excavation was
limited to further exposure of Feature 1. Five backhoe trenches were aligned perpenÂ­
dicular to the drainage (Fig. 55).
Site Stratigraphy

A detailed stratigraphic description of 41MC363 is provided in the Geomorphology
chapter of this report. Hand excavation of Feature 1 showed 5-10 cm of dark blocky clay
underlain by a very compact clayey zone with dense calcium carbonate and a Jackson
Group sandstone substrate.
Features and Burned Rock Concentrations

One feature and 23 burned rock concentrations were mapped during Phase III testing.
FEATUREl

On the southern crest of Area C, Feature 1 was a tight 50 x 50 cm cluster of 46 pieces of
tabular sandstone, ranging in size from 2 cm3 to 13 cm3 and averaging 3.3 em in thickness,
5.85 cm in width and 7.4 cm in length. Feature 1 is the only clearly intact hearth excavated
thus far in the study area (Fig. 56). Four large tabular rocks on the southwest side of the
feature are canted about 40 degrees toward the center of the hearth as though placed on

the sloping surface of a pit excavated into the clay. Elevations at the base of the slabs
range from 3 cm below datum on the southwestern periphery to 10 cm below datum in
the center. The absence of charcoal can be attributed to leaching. Smaller fragments of
sandstone overlie the northeastern corner of the feature and outliers are scattered 1 to
2 meters southwest of the hearth. Only two chert flakes were recovered from the feature
area.
BURNED ROCK CONCENTRATIONS

The 23 burned rock concentrations recorded at 41MC363 are typically dispersed burned
rock, largely fire-cracked sandstone, exposed on the surface and partially buried in the
upper 5 to 10 cm of clay (Table 16). Their exposure and distribution can be attributed to
sendero clearing, sheet erosion, and animal disturbance.
ARTIFACTS

The following lithic materials were recovered from 41MC363: 244 cores, 40 thick bifaces,
93 thin bifaces, 14 distally beveled tools, 8 unifaces, 51 trimmed flakes, 2 rejuvenation
flakes, 34 utilized flakes, 2 hammerstones, 7 grinding slabs, 1 mano, and 2265 flakes and
chips (Table 1). In most cases in the discussion below, only the groups and forms (for
definitions, please refer to the Artifacts section of this report) will be listed as they
provide adequate descriptive information. Tables 2-4 should be consulted for metric data
and material type for selected thick bifaces, thin bifaces, and distally beveled tools.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ARTIFACT

The item is a simple lug handle ceramic attachment probably formed by rolling a coil of
prepared clay and inserting its ends into holes in the vessel shoulder and neck (Fig. 30d).
Manufacturing was finished by smoothing the surface with a polishing instrument, which
left flattened marks on the outside curve of the handle. The exterior color is reddish
yellow (5YR6/6), but the interior is very dark gray (5YR3/1) due to being taken up
entirely in a strong carbon streak. This situation obtains from a low-temperature firing
in an oxidizing atmosphere. The ceramic fabric has abundant fine bone tempering with
additional sub-rounded to sub-angular sand particles, probably quartz and other
minerals. These latter are probably natural inclusions of the clay. The ceramic also
notably contains rounded, coarse sand-sized partices of hematite. These may also be
natural inclusions, but the possibility of deliberate addition to the clay must be left open.
The ceramic item is similar to bone-tempered pottery found throughout south Texas. The
lug feature is however not common and may indicate a late date for this fragment.
Vertebrate and Molluscan Fauna

No vertebrate nor molluscan faunal remains were recovered at 41MC363.

184 I SITE ANALYSIS

Summary and Interpretations

Site 41MC363 occupies an interfluviallobe overlooking the confluence of three water
courses. Four concentrations of cultural material were delineated amidst a dense surface
scatter of chipped stone artifacts, debitage, and burned rock (Fig. 57, Tables 17-18). The
overall similarity in artifact types eliminated the possibility that functionally specific tasks
differed from area to area. The site, however, contained a partially intact hearth and the
largest and most diverse artifact assemblage recorded in the prospect. The reasons for
the recurrent occupation of 41MC363 are apparent in the distribution of natural resourÂ­
ces in the immediate vicinity of the site.
Sandstone outcropping along the 91-92 meter contour level on the upper slopes provided
an abundant source of raw material for hearth construction and the manufacture of
grinding implements. Exfoliation has reduc~d some of the bedrock to slabs, easily
transported to the main body of the site. Although the majority of the burned rock is
apparently redeposited debris, too small to reuse as hearth stones, the one intact slabÂ­
lined hearth, Feature 1, illustrates the morphology, size and construction of at least one
feature type.
Lithic raw material for stone tool manufacture was available in the La Jarita Creek
gravels. Tested cobbles, cores, debitage and formal tools evidence primary and secondary
reduction with a proportional emphasis on the production of expediency tools. Two
hammerstones, an implement rarely recovered on the prospect sites, were collected at
41MC363.
Although no faunal remains were recovered during the testing program, a single mussel
shell fragment of the species Crytonaias tampicoensis collected during the survey phase,
suggests the now-intermittent streams near the site were once more permanent water
sources. From this location overlooking a grassy floodplain, prehistoric peoples could
exploit the riverine fauna and the grazing animals drawn to the forage and water of the
valley. The absence of bone and shell in the archeological record may be attributable to
the poor preservational environment.
Projectile point styles characteristic of the Middle and Late Archaic periods and the Late
Prehistoric period reflect the long span of prehistoric occupation at 41MC363. Late
Prehistoric or very early historic use of the site is also demonstrated by the one fragment
of prehistoric pottery recovered during the testing program, a broken lug handle (see
41MC104; Nightengale et ai. 1988 for another example from the prospect).
41MC367

Introduction

41MC367 is a long linear series of six open campsites occupying lobes and knolls along a
west-facing ridgeline overlooking the Hog Creek valley (Fig. 58). Each of the six
campsites, designated Areas A-F, represents a locus of activity where tools, cores,

debitage and burned rock accumulated as by-products of prehistoric camp activities.
Scattered between these campsites are isolated tools, cores and debitage. Two primary
tributaries of Hog Creek bound the site on the north and the south forming an interfluve
that trends northeast onto the upland divide. The south primary tributary, now dammed,
flowed into Hog Creek approximately 45 meters north of the present confluence of Hog
and La Jarita Creeks. The ridgeline occupied by 41MC367 is the southwest point or lobe
of the interfluve. Absolute elevations for campsites at 41MC367 range from 97 meters
mean sea level in Area F to 96 meters mean sea level in Areas B, C, D, and E.
About 1.5 km to the northeast and atop the divide at an elevation of 106 meters mean
sea level lies the open campsite of 41MC360. The south tributary valley separates
41MC363 and 41MC364 from 41MC367. About 2.2 km upstream from the confluence
lies 41MC108, a site also investigated as part of this project.
Erosion along the ridgeline varies with area. Pronounced gullying and rill formation is
most evident below the 97 meter contour line in Areas B, C, and D and the southwest
portion of Area A. In Area Band C where concentrations of cultural material are highest,
post depositional disturbances attributable to sendero clearing, over grazing and resulÂ­
tant sheet erosion have redeposited some material onto denuded bedrock surfaces that
dominate the lobe points. Sheet wash and sendero clearing have also affected the
deposition of material in Areas D, E, and F. Area E, at 96 meters mean sea level, is a low
knoll isolated from Area F by a swale. Of the six areas isolated along the ridgeline, Areas
D, E, and F contained the lowest frequencies of cultural material.
Vegetation varies with elevation in areas B through E. West and downslope of the 96.5
meter contour, dense thorny brush, short clump grasses, and cacti dominate. Above the
contour line, vegetation changes to moderately dense brush with scattered small grassy

Previous Research

Recorded during the 1985 survey, (Nightengale et at 1988:57), 41MC367 was classed as
a multiple function, upland margin site. Four areas were defined in a 330,000 square
meter area. In 1988, the site was extended another 100,000 square meters to the north
adding Areas E and F (see Appendix 1). Cultural material was concentrated along crests
and margins of Hog Creek. Isolated tools, flakes and in some cases burned rock were
lightly dispersed across the intervening areas. Varied densities of surficially exposed
cultural material included debitage, tools, cores, and burned rock. Collected material
included a Thin Unstemmed Biface (Group2 Form 2) and a unifacially worked Distally
Beveled Tool (Group 8 Form 1) from Area A; a Uniface (Group 2), a split cobble flake,
an untyped Thin Stemmed Biface (Group 1 Form 2) of silicified wood and a Thin
Stemmed Biface (Group 1 Form 3) which was identified as a Frio dart point and historic
glass from Area B; a unidirectional core (Group 4), a utilized tertiary flake (Group 3),
an unstemmed Thin Biface (Group 3 Form 1), and a Distally Beveled Tool (Group 3 Form
1) from Area C; and two unifaces (Groups 2 and 3) from Area F. All material was chert
unless otherwise specified. Temporally diagnostic prehistoric types date to the Middle
and Late Archaic periods.
Testing Methods

Transects and pin-flagging of artifacts were used to establish the boundaries of conÂ­
centrated areas of cultural debris and to provenience collected specimens. Two 4 x 25
meter flake transects sampled debitage in Area B, the densest concentration of cultural
material. Five backhoe trenches, ranging from 4 to 9 meters in length, were excavated
and profiled to assess the depth of the site and its stratigraphy. Two were placed in Area
A and three in Area B.
Site Stratigraphy

The stratigraphy of subsurface clays was documented in the backhoe trench profiles. The
underlying sandstone substrates were never reached but three zones were delineated.
The thickness of each zone and the maximum depth of the trench varied with location.
Munsell soil colors were taken dry.
ZONE I

Munsell color 10YR 3/1. A very dark gray blocky clay with rootlets, pebbles and silicified
wood fragments. Shrink swell cracks reach 20 cm below the surface. Cultural material
in Trenches 1 and 4 was confined to the upper 10 cm of this zone.

41MC367 / 191

ZONE II
Munsell color 10YR 7/3. A very pale brown transitional zone consisting of clays and
caliche pebbles. Cultural material was observed in the upper 10 cm of Trench 5 only
where the Zone I matrix has eroded, exposing Zone II matrix (Fig. 59).
ZONE III
Munsell color 10YR 8/2. A whitish clayey caliche matrix with feric mottles and fine sands
combined with lenses of very white caliche. Mottles range in color from brownish yellow
(10YR 6/8) to very pale brown (10YR 7/4). No cultural material was observed within this
zone in any of the profiles. All trenches terminated at this zone.

Features and Burned Rock Concentrations
BURNED ROCK CONCENTRATIONS
Twenty-seven burned rock concentrations were recorded at 41MC367 (Table 19) but no
features were designated. The concentrations are not discretely clustered and appear to
be the result of sendero clearing, rooting hogs, and erosion. The burned rock concentraÂ­
tions range in size from 50 cm in diameter to very broad and dispersed exposures up to
12 meters long. Sandstone is the dominant raw materiaL In some cases, burned
sandstone was mixed with high densities of debitage and tools. Judging from the small
pieces (3 cm3 to 5 cm3) of fire cracked sandstone found in the majority of the concentraÂ­
tions, it would appear that hearth stones, reduced to unusable size, were discarded. The
few examples comprised of larger pieces of sandstone may be the remains of hearths
scattered by returning prehistoric groups and later historic land use.

Artifacts
The following Iithic materials were recovered from 41M C367: 257 cores, 55 thick bifaces,
88 thin bifaces, 18 distally beveled tools, 8 unifaces, 22 trimmed flakes, 35 utilized flakes
and chips, 3 rejuvenation flakes, 8 grinding slab fragments, 3 manos, 2 grooved abraders,
and 295 flakes and chips (Table 3). In the discussion below, only the groups and forms
(as defined in the Artifacts chapter) will be listed as they provide adequate descriptive
information. The more diagnostic artifacts (i.e., projectile points, distally beveled tools,
etc.) will be described in detail along with information regarding chronological placeÂ­
ment and geographical distribution. Due to the nature of the sample, some of the groups
and forms of artifacts are not represented at this site. Metric data and material type for
selected thick bifaces, thin bifaces, and distally beveled tools are provided in Tables 4-7.

(For chronological placement and geographical distribution, the reader is
referred to Thin Bifaces, Group 1, Form 3, Specimen 111).
Specimen 400: This fragmentary specimen has a narrow, slightly expanding
stem (Fig. 22g). The distal end exhibits an impact fracture. The specimen
cannot be placed within existing dart point typologies.
Specimen 434: This small specimen has straight lateral edges, shallow sideÂ­
notches, expanding stem edges, and a concave basal edge (Fig. 22h). The
specimen does not fit within existing dart point typologies.

Hester 1985:84).
Geographical Distribution: Central Texas, westward towards the lower
Pecos and eastward towards the coastal plain (ibid.).
Specimen 588: This proximal fragment has long, shallow side notches, expandÂ­
ing stem edges, rounded basal corners, and a concave basal edge (Fig. 22k).
The specimen does not fit within existing dart point typologies.
Form 5. Small with Expanding Stem (1 specimen)
Specimen 489: This arrow point has slightly serrated lateral edges, a narrow
neck, expanding stem edges, and a straight basal edge (Fig. 22r). The
specimen is classified as a Seal/om point.
Chronological Placement: Late Prehistoric, ca. AD. 1200 to AD. 700
(Turner and Hester 1985:189.).
Geographical Distribution: Throughout Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:189).
Form 6. Unclassifiable Fragments of Large Stemmed Bifaces (2 specimens)
Specimens 7 and 240: These specimens are the medial portions of dart points
as evidenced by the presence of barbs.
Form 7. Unclassifiable Fragments of Small Stemmed Bifaces (1 specimen)
Specimen 252: This small, thin fragment appears to be the distal portion of an
arrow point.
Group 2. Unstemmed with Straight Bases (5 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (1 specimen)
Specimen 402: This triangular specimen has slightly convex lateral edges, a
straight basal edge, and has been basally thinned. The specimen is clasÂ­
sified as a Tortugas point.
Chronological Placement: Middle Archaic period, and perhaps earlier
(Turner and Hester 1985: 152; Hall, Hester, and Black 1986:399). Tortugas
points were associated with the late Middle Archaic cemetery zone at the
Lorna Sandia site, with radiocarbon dates of 850 B.C. to 600 B.C. (ibid.).

196 I SITEANALYSIS

Geographical Distribution: Very common in south Texas and the lower Rio
Grande; occasionally found in central Texas and the lower Pecos (Turner
and Hester 1985:152).
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (4 specimens). These specimens exhibit varying
degrees of thinness and symmetry and probably represent manufacturing
failures.
Group 3. Unstemmed with Concave Base (1 specimen)
Form 2. Proximal Fragments (1 specimen)
Group 4. Unstemmed with Convex Bases (24 specimens)
Form 1. Complete Triangular (8 specimens). The majority of these specimens
represent various stages of the lithic reduction process; most could not be
further thinned and are probably rejects. One specimen, 288, warrants
further discusssion:
Specimen 288: This small, thin biface has rounded corners and is missing the
extreme distal tip. This specimen is similar to other thin bifaces that have
been described as arrow point preforms (Highley et al. 1978:156; Black
1986b:76; Highley 1986:64, 109; Highley n.d.).
Form 4. Fragments with Convex to Semicircular Ends (16 specimens). These
specimens vary in symmetry and thinness, with most appearing to be broken
preforms.
Group 5. Unstemmed Leaf Shaped (1 specimen)
Group 6. Circular to Sub circular (1 specimen)
Group 8. Bifaces with Sharp, Slender Projections (5 specimens)
Specimen 74: This medial fragment has been flaked to produce a perforator/drill
working end along one lateral edge; most of the distal end is missing.
Specimen 139: This proximal fragment has contracting lateral edges that formed
a perforator/drill tip. The distal end is missing.
Specimen 261: This large, wide, thick flake has one end fashioned into a perÂ­
forator or drill tip. The extreme tip is missing.
Specimen 493: This long narrow perforator or drill is made of banded chert. The
proximal end is wide and then contracts to form a long, narrow bit. The
extreme bit end is missing.
Specimen 508: This long, narrow specimen has a wide proximal end with a concave
basal edge. The perforator/drill was probably made on a Plainview point as
the remaining portion of the proximal end has ground lateral and basal
edges. The long narrow bit exhibits very worn or smoothed lateral edges.
The extreme distal tip is missing.
Group 9. Fragments with Pointed Ends (16 specimens)
Group 10. Lateral and Medial Fragments (22 specimens)
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces (18 specimens)
Group 3. Short, Broad, Triangular to Subrectangular (5 specimens)
Form 1. Triangular, Proximal End Pointed (3 specimens)

Phytolith Analysis
Two soil samples from Zones II and III in Backhoe Trench 5 were submitted for analysis
(Appendix 4). Statements concerning climate based on the samples are skewed by less
refined sample collection strategies and the geologic age of the clays. A higher percentÂ­
age of panicoid grasses in Zone II and the dominance of chloridoid grass phytoliths in
Zone III indicates a drier climate was associated with Zone III samples. Unfortunately,
both zones predate human habitation.
Vertebrate and Molluscan Fauna
No vertebrate faunal remains were recovered at 41MC367.
Six specimens of fresh water bivalves were collected (Appendix 3). Five are Uniomerus
declivus and one is Cyrtonaias tampicoensis. The latter requires dependable water supÂ­
plies during all times of the year whereas the former grows in intermittant streams,
backwater sloughs and pools that periodically go dry. Two of the Uniomerus declivus
specimens were collected from a modern tank on Hog Creek; two came from the surface
of Area B and the fifth specimen came from 0-30 cm below the surface in Backhoe Trench
4 in Area B. The one Cyrtonaias tampicoensis specimen, found on the surface of Area B
amid high densities of cultural material, was charred. This species must have been
transported from a more reliable water source, in this case La J arita Creek. Specimens
of this species were also collected at 41MC362 and 41MC363. The Uniomerus declivus
in Area B may have been collected prehistorically during back water accumulations along
Hog Creek probably as a result of rainy season runoff and subsequent flooding. The
species has also been documented at 41MC360.

200 I SITEANALYSIS

Summary and Interpretations

Six open campsites along a west facing ridgeline bordering the Hog Creek valley were
subsumed under the site number 41MC367 (Figure 58). A series of distributional maps
and tables were generated to illustrate the variable density and variety in artifacts and
features (Fig.60, Table 20,21). By comparing and contrasting the distribution of certain
classes of artifacts, an attempt was made to isolate task-specific activity loci on an
intra-area and interarea basis. Four classes of artifacts were mapped; 1) discard types,
2) diagnostics, 3) utilized debitage with certain types of cores and 4) miscellaneous types.
Generally, the horizontal distribution of artifact classes is illustrated in Figure 60. Area
B is the most densely occupied, followed by Area C. Areas A, D, E, and F are relatively
light lithic scatters.
INTRA-AREA PATTERNING

Area A artifacts are dispersed over an approximate 300 x 300 meter area, clustering along
the lower western slopes near the floodplain. Ground visibilty varies from poor in the
dense open grassy areas on the eastern slopes to fair in the moderately dense thorny brush
areas on the western slopes. All four class catagories are represented. The majority of
lithics, admittedly small in number, are cores and thick bifaces. Four burned rock
concentrations, numbers 3-6, evidence domestic activities, either as scattered hearths
and/or discarded fire-cracked sandstone dispersed by later land use. The primary task
indicated by the tool kit is primary biface reduction of chert cobbles. One of the few
hammerstones found in the project area was associated with thick bifaces and cores.
Lesser functions, such as grinding, scraping, cutting and wood working are suggested by
mano fragments, trimmed and utilized flakes and a distally beveled tool. The latter dates
Area A to the Middle Archaic and perhaps the Late Archaic periods. Area A differs from
the rest of the site only in quantity of material. The focus of activities at Area A may well
have been the resources to the southwest near the confluences and, to a lesser extent, on
the southern slopes where flat benches were conducive to camping.
Area B occupies a relatively open flat lobe, 90 x 90 meter, along the northwestern edge
of the site. There, a denuded bedrock surface supports only dispersed brush and clump
grasses providing excellent surface visibility, The lesser artifact density on the southern
periphery may be attributable to poorer visibility in the dense thorny brush and cacti.
Wall profiles from Backhoe Trenches 3-5 indicate a Zone I weathered clay surface that
has eroded away near the point of the lobe (Fig. 59). Artifacts found in the upper 10 cm
are mainly the result of shrink/swell dynamics. One attractive resource in Area B is the
exposed sandstone outcrops on the northwestern margins. Other factors would include
proximity to natural resources within the adjacent valley and nearby uplands.
Again, Area B had all four artifact classes defined for the site. The higher frequency of
discard types, diagnostics, and use types indicate multiple functions and several reoccupaÂ­
tions of a favored locale. Thick and thin biface manufacturing failures, tested and

unmodified cobbles, and all catagories of flakes reflect primary and secondary reduction
and core production. Core nulcei (Group 6) indicate reuse of selected raw material for
manufacture of flake tools with final discard at the site. Multidirectional (Group 3) and
bidirectional (Group 2) cores suggest the manufacture of expediency flakes for varied
camp tasks ranging from cutting to scraping. High frequencies of trimmed and utilized
flakes represent the final product discarded at the site. Slab- and- mano and ground stone
fragments functioned as vegetal processors and honers. Distally beveled tools speculaÂ­
tively functioning as planers, scrapers, hide processors and/or root extractors are present.
No discernable use area other than the overall scatter centered on the northwestern lobe
near the sandstone outcrops was isolated. Middle and Late Archaic occupations with
some evidence for Late Prehistoric use are reflected in the temporally diagnostic types.
Although Area C is smaller in size and artifact density, it was apparently used to perform
the same functions as Area B. Quantifiably fewer artifacts were found at Area C but the
majority of functional catagories are the same as in Area B. The topographic location is
similar but the vegatation differs in that the brush is denser in Area C. The surface is
predominantly denuded bedrock with scattered clumps of grass. Three sandstone outÂ­
crops were mapped along the lower western and southwestern margins. Artifacts were
also found exposed on the surface and along the margins of an east-west tributary that
forms the south boundary of the area. Classes of artifacts clustered on the north side of
the lobe with burned rock concentrations 13-20. ActivIties appear to have been centered
on the north and northwest portions of the area where discard, use, and diagnostic classes
of artifacts co-occur with burned rock concentrations in proximity to the three sandstone
outcrops. Area C is however, farther from the resource base offered by Hog and La Jarita
Creeks. Temporal diagnostics as currently defined for this region of south Texas suggest
Middle and Late Archaic as well as Late Prehistoric occupations.

Area D is located in fairly open mesquite and brushy vegetation with numerous short
grassy clearings. The cultural material in Area D is dispersed along the ridge line and
western margins. The relatively low frequencies of artifacts within each class and the
absence of certain types suggests only sporadic or short occupations centered in Area D.
The burned rock concentrations 21-24 however, confirm that some habitation took place.
A grinding slab fragment and a grooved stone fragment suggest processing activities
similar to Areas A through C. Temporally diagnostic artifacts are Middle Archaic and
Late Prehistoric in age.
Brush, mesquite, and cacti surrounding short clump grass clearings grow on denuded
bedrock surfaces in Area D. Topographically, Area E occupies a low knoll on the Hog
Creek floodplain, separated from Area F by a swale cut by an ephemeral drainage.
Unlike Areas B, C, and to some extent D, no sandstone outcrops were observed in Area
E. Burned rock concentrations 25 and 26, on the top and north slopes of the knoll
exposed by rooting hogs and redeposited in erosional rills. Artifacts from different
classes cluster in the vicinity of the knolltop burned rock concentration. Thick bifaces,
tested cobbles, manufacturing failures, and a hammerstone reflect reduction of cherts
acquired in La Jarita Creek. Trimmed and utilized flakes as well as cores from most
groups are present in the Area. Absent are grinding implements. Tasks similar to those

41MC367 I 205

accomplished at other areas were carried out at Area E with an orientation toward the
floodplain resources such as game. molluscs and other aquatic resources. Temporal
diagnostics at the area suggest Paleo indian, Middle and Late Archaic occupations.
F. the smallest and sparest area defined at the site. lies on a grassy lobe of the ridgeline
farther from the creek juncture. Sandstone hearth materials had to be brought in from
outcrops closer to the confluence. The limited assemblage is very similar to those in the
more densely occupied areas but in smaller numbers.
In summary. Area A-F contain various classes of artifacts that can be used to interpret
several task related activities being carried out at each area. Overall, the range of artifact
types characteristic of multi-functional camps located in optimal resource zones is
represented but with little differentiation by area other than in overall density. Small
variations, such as time periods represented, may well be attributable to sampling error
introduced by such diverse factors as length of prehistoric occupations and relic hunting.
Distributional studies clearly demonstrate that intensity of occupation is directly correÂ­
lated to proximity to the creek confluence resource base with the added factor of
sandstone outcrops for ready access to hearth stones.

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Four models describing factors that affected prehistoric use of the south Texas landscape
were considered in analyzing the results of the intensive survey of the Extended San
Miguel Prospect (Nightengale et al. 1988; see also Archeological Background). Sites
were classified according to criteria proposed by Shafer and Baxter (1975) in their survey
of the original San Miguel Prospect. The quantity and diversity of the artifact assemblage
defined limited and multi-functional site types. No sites attributable to Shafer and
Baxter's third category, resource procurement, were recorded. Three physiographic
zones--valley, upland margin and upland divide--were distinguished on the basis of minor
relief and proximity to water. None of the recorded sites are far from one of the major
tributaries or mainstem creeks that drain the study area. Although both site types were
found in all three zones, multifunctional sites concentrated in the La J arita valley,
conforming to models that relate occupation to the distribution of natural resources
(Shafer and Baxter 1975; Hester 1971). The limited function sites were considered
satellite foraging camps, occupied seasonally or by specific task groups based in the larger
multi-functional sites. Sites recommended for further evaluation of their National
Register of Historic Places eligibility sampled both site types and all three physiographic
zones. The final configuration of mine development resulted in the limited testing of
eight sites, six previously classified as multi-functional. Two sites, 41MC362, a limited
function site, and 41MC363 sampled cultural deposits in the valley zone. The remaining
six were evenly distributed between the upland divide (41AT86, 41AT87, 41MC360) and
the upland margin zone (41AT77, 41MC108, 41MC367).
The information recovered at these sites is complemented by previous work at nine sites
in the La Parita Creek valley (Usrey, Grysinski and Bond 1978; Usrey 1980), bringing the
total to 17 tested sites in the overall San Miguel Prospect. In composite, these projects
provide the largest block of upland sites yet subjected to systematic testing in south Texas
yet only the most general interpretations can be offered in the absence of chronological
and spatial controls;
Despite the limited test excavations and backhoe exploration conducted at sites 41AT87,
41MC362, 41MC363, and 41MC367, no stratified deposits were isolated to provide
control over the age and associations of the features and artifact assemblages recorded.
Areas where large blocks could be excavated, an approach found necessary in the Choke
Canyon project, are simply not present in the San Miguel study area. The two radiocarÂ­
bon assays obtained from sites 41MC362 and 41MC379 (Appendix I) only suggest the age
of one stratum or feature, and artifact associations are lacking. The poor preservational
environment afforded by the prospect soils, the displacement of cultural material in the
shrink-swell clays, disturbances caused by repeated occupation, massive erosion, modern
land use, and relic hunting have all seriously depleted the potential for reconstruction of
past environments and lifeways.

207

208 I SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

To maintain consistency with other regional studies, the artifact assemblage was classified
using the Choke Canyon typology, an approach based largely on morphology. Collected
artifacts were later combined into three classes--discard, diagnostic and use--in the hopes
that broader patterns could be discerned by plotting artifact proveniences on site base
maps. Computer programs were written to translate transit readings to map coordinates
and to input selected data classes into standard mapping programs. These distributional
studies confirm that intra-site patterning has been reduced to generalized concentrations
of cultural materials with few intact features or activity loci. However, overall site
densities and artifact frequencies by type can be used to make broad statements on the
activities performed (cf. Hester, Gilbow, and Albee 1973; Brown et aI. 1982) and the
intensity and purpose of site occupation (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986; Binford 1982).
LITHIC PROCUREMENT FOR CHIPPED STONE TOOL MANUFACTURE
The majority of collected artifacts are chipped stone tools and cores manufactured
primarily from chert with admixtures of silicified wood, chalcedony and quartzite. The
probable source of lithic raw materials are the chert-bearing gravel deposits mantling the
interfluve west of La Jarita Creek and in the La Parita Creek valley. Although some sites
were recorded atop gravel outcrops, tested sites along La J arita and Hog creeks and on
the upland divide are from 200 meters to 3 km distant from the La Jarita source. Sites
41AT86 and 41AT87 are equidistant from the La Jarita and La Parita gravels which lie 6
km away. Shafer and Baxter (1975:62) identified source materials in San Miguel Creek
where rounded to subrounded chert cobbles were observed in gravel and alluvial
deposits.
Whole and tested chert cobbles, chunks of chalcedony and palmwood at sites 41AT86,
41MC108, 41MC360, 41MC363, and 41MC367 indicate transport of raw materials for
initial reduction. All stages of the reduction sequence are evidenced by cores, primary
flakes, manufacturing failures and thick and thin bifaces at the same sites. The one intact
activity locus documented in the project area was a Late Prehistoric chalcedony chipping
area at 41MC108. Usrey (1980:129) found similar procurement patterns at the seven
.:;,..sites tested in the La Parita valley - 41AT25, 41AT29, 41AT30, 41AT31, 41AT36, 41AT43
and 41AT54. By comparison, several of the sites recorded by Texas A & M (Shafer and
Baxter 1975:40-41) and in the 1985 and 1988 surveys (Nightengale et at. 1988; Appendix
1) on the margins of the gravel-capped upland divide between La J arita and San Miguel
creeks hold evidence of initial procurement and primary reduction but little emphasis on
later stages of tool production.
In Choke Canyon, Hall, Black and Graves (1982:467-468) noted little difference between
quarry and non-quarry sites since small easily transportable chert cobbles were readily
available in the Frio River and on upland valley edges and margins. None of the sites in
their project area were more than 4 km from a lithic source and many were within a 2-km
radius of a chert supply. By contrast, Hester (1978) observed a more specialized pattern
in Dimmit and Zavala counties where raw materials were procured from gravel-capped
margins and uplands but sites in the valley showed little evidence of initial reduction.
In the San Miguel prospect, like Choke Canyon, the abundance of raw material for stone
tool manufacture suggests localized procurement zones could be efficiently exploited

SANDSTONE PROCUREMENT I 209

from a variety of locations, thus exerting little influence on settlement patterns. Thus,
lithic procurement may have been an embedded activity (Binford 1982), subsumed under
exploitation strategies that concentrated on the acquisition of other, as-yet undefined
resources.

SANDSTONE PROCUREMENT
Sandstone ranks as one of the most utilized resources in the study area. Fire-cracked
sandstone litters the surface of every tested site. Much of the burned rock is fragmentary,
the pieces too small to efficiently reuse, and concentrated in areas that may be discard
locales. Although Usrey (1980:106) and Usrey, Grysinski and Bond (1978:70) found no
intact features in their testing of sites in the original San Miguel prospect, they speculated
that the smaller pieces were discards from relined hearths. Distributional studies idenÂ­
tified one probable discard area at 41MC360 where a high frequency of fire-cracked
sandstone fragments were comingled with lesser frequencies of burned chert and
silicified wood, and discard classes of artifacts.
The one relatively intact slab-lined hearth documented in this testing phase, Feature 1
at 41MC363, illustrates the probable configuration of at least some of the sandstone
hearths but it could not be dated. Sandstone hearths recorded by Hill and Hester (1971)
in upland areas were associated with predominantly Archaic materials and similar feaÂ­
tures at 41LK87 were of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric age. Another explanation for
the large quantities of fractured burned rock is that they are the remnants of ovens or the
end result of stone-boiling.
Sandstone grinding implements were recovered from seven of the eight tested sites and
in all three physiographic zones defined for the prospect (Table 3). Only 41MC362,
situated on a levee in the La J arita Creek valley, failed to produce any grinding stone
fragments. Slab fragments were collected at all seven sites with the highest frequency
coming from 41MC360, 41MC363, and 41MC367. Manos were recorded at 41AT77,
41MC108, 41MC360, 41MC363, and 41MC367. The distribution of grooved stones,
presumably used as honers, smoothers or abraders in platform preparation, almost
mirrored that of manos, with fragments collected at 41AT77, 41MC108, 41MC360, and
41MC367.
During the earlier survey phase in the Extended San Miguel Prospect, singular and
multi-faceted grinding slabs were documented at 41AT75, 41AT85, 41MC341, 41MC347,
and 41MC250. Slab, mano and grooved stone fragments were recorded at 41AT80 and
41MC347. Usrey (1980:106) recovered slab fragments and grooved stones from 41AT54
along La Parita Creek and a complete slab, donated to Shafer and Baxter (1975:59), had
been collected from 41MC112 on San Miguel Creek. Modified sandstone, present on the
majority of the sites in the lowland Choke Canyon project area, was attributed equally to
Archaic and Late Prehistoric contexts (HaU, Hester, and Black 1986:321).
Ground stone grinding implements are generally considered to have functioned as
domestic processing tools and to imply an emphasis on processing of seeds, nuts, roots
and other vegetation. Some indication of probable vegetal foods was recovered by Hester
and Hill (1975:16) who identified charred acorn fragments and spiny hackberry seeds at
two sites in Zavala County. Despite the absence of food remains, the grinding stones at

210 / SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

sites in the San Miguel prospect may reflect seasonal incursions to collect and process
similar staple foods, including prickly pear. A large, overturned metate left at site
41AT85 is certainly suggestive of scheduled returns to specific locations, probably on a
seasonal basis.
Sandstone outcrops were apparently a focal point of intra-site occupation. Distributional
maps illustrate the concentration of cultural material in proximity to on-site sandstone
sources which were identified at 41AT77, 41AT87, 41MC363 and 41MC367. Sites
41MC108, 41MC360, 41MC362 and 41MC363 range from 100 to 700 meters from natural
outcrops so some transport was required. The requirement for hearth stone raw
materials at 41AT86 was probably satisfied by outcrops at 41AT85 about 1 km away, a
distance that confirms sandstone procurement was not always a primary factor in site
location.
In his analysis of the Rhode Ranch survey in McMullen County, Robinson (1980:66)
postulated a late spring-early fal1 movement from the Nueces River into the uplands when
water is more plentiful. He suggested "occupation of the dry upland zone by full bands,
with chert, silicified wood, and sandstone resource procurement the stimulus for the
movement out of the riparian zones along the major rivers". In the San Miguel Prospect,
sandstone procurement appears to have been an added inducement in the selection of
specific site locations. In the hierarchy of site locational preferences, groups exploiting
food resources on a seasonal basis must have had as a first priority access to water. A
secondary consideration may well have been cost-efficient proximity to sandstone hearth
materials. The manufacture of grinding implements would be a natural by-product of the
accessibility to raw materials needed for the immediate task of processing vegetal staples.
The rarity of intact grinding implements and their inclusion as caches at the cemetery site
of Loma Sandia also hints at the curation of ground stone tools.
CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS

All the chipped stone artifacts were analyzed within the typology established for the
Choke Canyon reservoir assemblage. A full description is provided in Chapter 5 and only
relevant types will be summarized here. Classes of artifacts were grouped into categories
reflective of use, discard or time period. Distributional maps were computerMgenerated
for each site, plotting specific groups and forms and combined classes of artifacts in an
attempt to discern activity loci, associations with features and natural resources, and
differences between site inventories. Factors such as massive erosion, lack of soil
development, post-occupational disturbances and modern land use have apparently
destroyed the integrity of the sites and only general patterns could be isolated. The
software written for these tasks may prove to be a useful analytic tool if applied to more
intact site deposits.
Cores comprise the largest artifact category recovered in the prospect. Their weight
inhibits extensive erosional displacement and they are unlikely to be collected by relic
hunters. Core groups 6 and 9, the dominant types, were classed as discard artifacts and
their distribution plotted. The co-occurrence of discard class artifacts and fragmentary
burned rock identified one area of 41MC360 as a possible refuse deposit but, in general,
mixing of all classes was apparent at the other tested sites.

VERTEBRATEANDMOLLUSCANFAUNA /211

Group 9 was the most frequently recovered core at Choke Canyon; the number of group
6 cores is almost equal to the San Miguel collection (Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Hall,
Hester and Black 1986). At the predominantly Late Prehistoric Mariposa site (41ZV83)
in Zavala County, where group 6 specimens comprised 41 % of the total core count,
Montgomery (1978:70) identified concentrations which he identified as discard areas.
The dominance of cores in the San Miguel assemblage may be explained by the abunÂ­
dance of natural chert sources. The easy availability of raw material may have made it
more efficient to abandon undepleted cores on site for later reuse (Custer 1987:60-61).
Despite the evidence for intensive lithic reduction in the San Miguel sites, hammerstones
were rarely observed. Only five specimens were collected during the combined survey
and testing phases. Previous survey and testing in the La Parita Creek Valley produced
one specimen (Shafer and Baxter 1975; Usrey 1980; Usrey, Grysinski and Bond 1978)
and 23 hammerstones were collected in the Choke Canyon project area (Hall, Black and
Graves 1982; Hall, Hester and Black 1986). Their rarity may be attributable to curation
of favored specimens or to the use of antler billets or other non-preservable tools in lithic
reduction. The inclusion of hammerstones with cores, stemmed and unstemmed thin
bifaces in a burial cache at the Lorna Sandia cemetery site demonstrates their role in the
south Texas tool kit (Taylor and Highley, n.d.).
VERTEBRATE AND MOLLUSCAN FAUNA

The poor preservational environment afforded by the Prospect soils limited the recovery
of vertebrate faunal remains to burned and unburned deer-sized and rabbit-sized bones
in excavation units at 41MC362. Fragments of turtle carapace at the same site suggest
exploitation of riverine fauna. The higher frequencies of faunal remains found in the
upper levels, tentatively dated to the Late Archaic period, may be a function of preserÂ­
vation. No vertebrate faunal remains were found during the La Parita testing program
(Usrey 1980). Diverse vertebrate faunal remains, indicating a wide range of utilized
species, were documented at riparian sites in Zavala and Dimmit counties (Hester 1975)
and Jim Wells County (Black 1986b). The Late Prehistoric sites in Dimmit and Zavala
counties showed an emphasis on deer procurement supplemented by jackrabbit, cottonÂ­
tail, packrat, cottonrat, fish, bird and reptiles. A similarly diverse fauna was exploited by
people occupying the Late Prehistoric site of 4IJW8 (Steele 1986a:108-136) and the
lowland sites along the Frio River in Choke Canyon (Steele and Assad-Hunter 1986:452Â­
502). A dietary shift toward larger mammals, especially deer, noted by Steele (1986b) at
41LK201 was supported by the analysis of other Choke Canyon site fauna.
The molluscan fauna collected from the San Miguel prospect sites are much more
informative. A single bivalve from 41MC360 was classed as Uniomerus declivus, a species
that survives in pooled water and back water pools of temporary streams, much like the
intermittent water courses of the modern project area. This mussel was most likely
harvested during the spring or fall rainy season.
The majority of the freshwater bivalves belong to species Crytonaias tampicoensis
(41MC367), Lampsilis teres, Toxolasma texasensis, and Potamilus purpuratus (41MC362).
During the survey phase, these species were also noted at 41MC363, 41MC381 and
41MC377. The latter site yielded a worked Lampsilis teres shell. All these species

212 / SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

depend on a permanent water habitat, a requirement not met in the project area today.
La J arita Creek apparently once flowed year-around, providing a ready food resource
most easily harvested during projected low water periods (mid-summer and late fall).
Expectably, the riverine environment of the Choke Canyon project area supported larger
populations of freshwater bivalves. Human populations primarily exploited Cyrlonaias
tampicoensis and Lampsilis sp. (Murray 1982:541-555), acquired from the nearby Frio
River. The La Par ita testing program produced unidentifiable mussel and snail shell
fragments only at site 41AT22 (Usrey 1980). Unspecified Unio bivalves, found at sites
along intermittent tributaries, such as Turkey Creek, in Zavala County, had been used
both for food and the production of ornaments (Hester and Hill 1975: 16; Montgomery
1978:103). Similarly, riparian site 41JW8, south of the Nueces River on now-intermittent
Chiltipin Creek, contained high frequencies of Toxolasma parva with lesser quantities of
Cyrtonaias tampicoensis and Lampsilis teres. The presence of these species suggests that
Chiltipin Creek, like La Jarita and La Parita creeks, was once perennial and perhaps
artesian-fed (Murray 1986: 146).
In summary, the vertebrate fauna contributed little to an understanding of prehistoric
procurement patterns. The molluscan fauna, however, reflects environmental conditions
quite different from those of today. Thus, during some periods of prehistory, water was
not the limiting factor in exploitation of the area's biotic resources.
CHRONOLOGY OF PROSPECT OCCUPANCY

In the absence of a suite of radiocarbon dates, reconstructing the prehistoric sequence
of project area occupation must rely on cross-dating according to artifacts recovered in
stratified deposits in adjacent regions. The following discussion relies on temporally
diagnostic styles as described by Turner and Hester (1985) and refined by Highley.
Any interpretation of site chronology based on temporally diagnostic projectile points
must be tempered by the knowledge that prospect sites have been intensively collected
for decades. Nevertheless, the entire range of south Texas prehistory is represented in
the artifact assemblage recorded during survey and subsequent testing (Table 22). The
1988 field work little altered the conclusions offered by Cloud (Nightengale et al. 1988)
at the close of the 1985 survey.
Paleoindian 9000-6000 B.C.
Paleoindian manifestations include the reworked Plainview and Golondrina dart points
recovered during the survey and the Folsom point in a local landowner's collection from
41MC364. The Late Paleoindian sample, which consisted of one Angostura dart point,
was expanded by the recovery of three Angostura dart points, two of which had been
reworked into drills (41MC360). No particular preference for any physiographic zone
could be detected in the distribution of Paleoindian and Late Paleoindian artifacts and
the origin of the reworked drills remains problematic.

0= Diagnostic artifacts from Nightengale et al. 1988.
Early Archaic 6000-2500 B.C.

Nine dart points and a Guadalupe tool attributable to the Early Archaic period were
reported by Cloud (Nightengale et al. 1988). Only one dart point of this age, an Early
Triangular form, and one additional Guadalupe tool were recovered from 41AT86 during
the testing phase. Their overall distribution, however, is relatively evenly divided beÂ­
tween the valley and upland divide physiographic zones with only one specimen, a Uvalde
dart point, provenienced to an upland margin site (41AT107). Two sites, 41AT86 and
41MC360, yielded six of the specimens, thus weighting the sample toward the upland
divide zone.
Middle Archaic 2500-400 B.C.

The Middle Archaic sample garnered during the survey was composed of seven dart
points - one Pedemales-like, one Tortugas, one Morhiss, and four Abasolos - and eight
Nueces tools. Evidence for this time period was greatly increased by the collection of 22
Tortugas dart points. 1 Morhiss dart point and 4 Nueces tools during the testing phase.

214 I SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

Middle Archaic types are the most common temporal diagnostic and specimens were
found on all the tested sites with the single exception of 41AT87. Cloud's (1987)
tentative conclusion that some preference for the valley zone was reflected in the
distribution of temporal diagnostics must be expanded due to the recovery of eight
Tortugas points and two Nueces tools at 41AT86, one Tortugas point at 41MC360, and
three Tortugas points at 41MC108, all upland divide sites. The inventory does however
tentatively mirror the intensity of occupation attributed to this period in Choke Canyon
(Hall, Hester and Black 1986:398-402) despite the absence of well-made massive clusters
of burned rock associated with the Middle Archaic population influx in that riverine
environment.
Late Archaic 400 B.C. - A.D. 900

Eight dart points of Late and Transitional Archaic age were recovered during the survey
phase. Eleven additional specimens were subsequently collected - six Ensor, two Frio
and one each of the Desmuke, Darl and Fairland types. The distribution across the
prospect slightly favored the upland margin zone but not to a statistically significant
degree. The relatively large sample of Late Archaic styles seems to continue the Middle
Archaic occupational intensity, a trend which Hall, Hester and Black (1986:401) sugÂ­
gested represented a long period of concentrated human activity in the Choke Canyon
valley.
Late Prehistoric A.D. 900-A.D. 1400

Nineteen complete and fragmentary arrow points and two bone-tempered sherds comÂ­
prise the Late Prehistoric temporal assemblage. Eleven lithic specimens and one sherd
were collected during the testing phase and eight arrow points and one ceramic fragment
were added by testing. Upland divide sites 41AT86 and 41AT87, and 41MC362 in the
valley zone produced no Late Prehistoric artifacts. Cloud (1987) detected a shift from
upland margin to valley occupation during the Late Prehistoric, a finding not significantly
changed by the testing results. Although arrow points are found in all the physiographic
zones, the later Perdiz type (3 specimens) is restricted to valley settings while the earlier
Scallorn arrow points (8 specimens) concentrate along the upland margins. This pattern
was recognized at Choke Canyon, giving more validity to the small sample observations
in the San Miguel prospect.
Summary Of Chronology

In summary, the temporal diagnostics recovered in both survey and testing phases reflect
a regional trend toward more intensive exploitation and perhaps increased population
density that peaks in the Middle Archaic period and is maintained until late Late
Prehistoric times. The apparent decrease late in prehistoric must be viewed cautiously
due to the potential for error in such a small sample. Slight shifts in occupational

SUMMARYAND RECOMMENDATIONS I 215

preference may have biased the recovery of projectile points and pottery attributable to
the post-contact population. However, the parallels between the San Miguel and Choke
Canyon findings lend credence to this reconstruction of local occupational trends.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Although the extensive data recovery methods employed mitigated the inevitable loss of
information, the testing of eight sites in the Extended San Miguel Prospect little altered
the interpretations and conclusions offered in the report on the intensive survey. All the
sites in the prospect have experienced cultural and natural disturbance, both in prehistory
and modern times. The slow rate of soil development, estimated by Car an (Chapter 4),
would have left the cultural debris from successive camping episodes exposed for long
periods while the soil properties inhibited preservation of organic materials, and
promoted vertical and horizontal displacement. Modem land use accelerated erosion by
the construction of sender os, roads, oil wells, and general land clearing. Relic hunting
has seriously depleted the sample of temporally and functionally diagnostic artifacts left
on the Prospect sites.
If ethnohistoric accounts of the movements of post-contact native groups are applicable
to the study area (Campbell and Campbell 1981), the prospect was but one segment of a
much larger seasonal round. Specific site locations were apparently reoccupied
throughout prehistory, the later occupations dispersing the cultural debris left in previous
years and perhaps expanding the bounds of the campsites. A hierarchy of motivating
factors in site selection may have been access to water near high density resource areas
with the added convenience of nearby lithic raw materials for hearth construction and
tool manufacture.

The division of the prospect into physiographic zones is somewhat misleading. None of
the sites is far from one of the intermittent streams or tributaries. The only apparent
preference for a specific microenvironment within the prospect may be detected in the
tentative shift to valley occupation during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period.
Some differentiation in site size and artifact assemblages, however, suggests some locaÂ­
tions were used either for specific limited functions or for a much shorter period of time.
For example, the two sparsest and smallest sites tested, 41AT87, on the highest point in
the study area, and 41MC362, on a levee in the creek bottom, are topographic opposites.
The limited lithic assemblage at 41AT87 is consistent with a hunting camp where the tool
kit was supplemented and refurbished. The levee location of 41MC362 was ideally suited
for procurement of riverine fauna except for the potential for inundation.
The testing program accomplished the goal of recovering a representative sample of the
cultural debris from each of the selected sites. In our opinion, the potential of the
remaining sites to contribute to an understanding of regional prehistory was exploited
and further mitigative action is unlikely to produce information relevant to major reÂ­
search problems. The San Miguel Electric Coop responded to concerns for the possible
NRHP eligibility of 41MC362, voiced by the Texas Historical Commission, by erecting a
protective buffer around the site pending decisions by the various regulatory agencies.
The varied efforts to derive significant information by surface collection of South Texas
sites can contribute to the formulation of research designs for future work in the prospect

216 / SUMMARYAND CONCLUSIONS

and similar settings. Based on experience gained in the Choke Canyon reservoir studies,
Hall recommended that research efforts in south Texas should concentrate on wellÂ­
stratified or buried single component sites where the information potential is
commensurate with the investment. In addition, large block excavations are essential to
determine horizontal patterning and chronology of occupation (Hall, Hester, and Black
1986). The survey and testing results and Caran's geomorphic analyses demonstrate that
such an opportunity is unlikely in the San Miguel Prospect as it is currently defined.
Predictably, future expansion of the mine will affect large, dispersed surficial artifact
scatters, similar to those documented in this report. This testing program has
demonstrated that survey level information is often sufficient to exploit the total potenÂ­
tial of this site type. Data recovery may still be justified if the site is to be destroyed but
increased mapping and collection during survey may achieve the same level of informaÂ­
tion as limited testing. In the future, emphasis should be placed on small, single
component sites and the rare intact activity areas where some chronological or functional
data may be retrieved rather than the acquisition of a large, generalized surface asÂ­
semblage.

APPENDIX 1
PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
OF THE PROPOSED SAN MIGUEL
LIGNITE MINE EXTENSION
Leland C. Bement
INTRODUCTION
In 1985, the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin carried out an
intensive survey of 5,583 acres in the San Miguel Prospect, Atascosa and McMullen
counties for Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., agents for the San Miguel Electric Co-op.
Subsequent alterations to the mining permit plan eliminated 640 acres that had not been
surveyed due to landowner restrictions and added 800 acres west of the original prospect
along the McMullen-Atascosa county line (Fig. 1). Present plans for mine development
include a retention pond to be constructed along Hog Creek with a spillway entering the
left bank of La J ari ta Creek.
An intensive pedestrian survey of the 800-acre tract was conducted between February 16
and 25, 1988 by Leland C. Bement, Bruce A. Nightengale, William A. Cloud, Joseph M.

Sanchez, and Jeffery A. Huebner of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), The University of Texas at Austin. This appendix describes the survey findings
and offers recommendations for the prudent consideration of the 10 newly recorded sites.
FIELD TECHNIQUES

The pedestrian survey was conducted by three archeologists walking serpentine transects
at 30 meter intervals across the project area. Site areas were flagged at first identification
during a pass of the survey party. The approximate edges of the site area were delineated
during subsequent transects. In addition to defining site boundaries, artifact clusters or
accumulations of cultural material were marked. In this fashion, site boundaries and
dense artifact areas were identified during the survey, thus allowing for quicker recording
of sites with the completion of the surveyed areas. All site boundaries and artifact
concentrations were plotted on a 2 foot contour map of the project area. Sites were
recorded on standard State ofTexas forms with supplemental data noted in a daily journal.
Sketch maps were drawn for each site and color and black and white photographs were
taken.
RESULTS
The intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed 800-acre extension of the San Miguel
Lignite Prospect resulted in the identification and recording of 10 prehistoric sites and

235

236 I APPENDIX 1

the extension of three previously recorded sites to the west. Eight of the 10 newly
recorded sites are within the McMullen County portion of the project area; two sites lie
in Atascosa County.
The area surveyed by this project consists of the upland interfluve between the lower
reaches of Hog and La J arita Creeks and short sections of each drainage bottom. The
low-lying areas along Hog Creek will be affected by the construction of a holding pond.
In addition, the spillway from the proposed small reservoir will drain into La Jarita Creek.
Site Descriptions

The 10 new sites are described using the variables of setting on the landscape, depth of
cultural deposits, site size, and estimation of time periods of occupancy.
41AT91

Site 41AT91 is an open campsite located on a low hill east of' Hog Creek below the
confluence of a left bank tributary. The distribution of site materials measures 120
meters north-south and 180 meters east-west. Cultural materials are deposited on a
common surface with little burial except for isolated pockets of colluvium. Lithic
artifacts included debitage, cores, tested cobbles, and bifaces at various stages of reducÂ­
tion. A single Nueces biface places at least one occupation of the site during Archaic
times. Less common lithic debris, consisting of burned rock and sandstone fragments,
suggests that cooking and food processing tasks were also performed at the site.
41AT93

41AT93 is an open campsite atop a knoll midway between Hog Creek and an unnamed
tributary at the northern limits of the study area. Cultural material including burned
rock, flakes, cores, bifaces, and gouges, is exposed over an area 95 meters on a northwestÂ­
southeast axis and 75 meters on the southwest-northeast axis. No features or potentially
intact concentrations were noted. One Nueces biface and one Frio dart point reflect
Archaic, and more specifically, Late Archaic occupation of the site. A transmission line
bisects the site, intersecting with a sendero atop the knoll. The cultural deposits have
been displaced by the modern construction and intense erosion.
41MC374

Site 41MC374 is an open campsite located on an upland interfluve between Hog Creek
to the east and an unnamed tributary of La Jarita Creek to the west. The site consists of
secondary and tertiary flakes, bifacial cores, and small amounts of burned rock scattered
over an area 60 meters north-south by 60 meters east-west. Cultural material is limited
to the surface except in the few instances where artifacts have moved downward in the

APPENDIX 1 I 237

broad cracks of the clayey soils, in rodent burrows, or tree fall holes. No temporally
diagnostic materials were recovered, precluding any possibility of assigning a time period
for human occupancy.
41MC375

Site 41MC375 is located on the same broad interfluve as 41MC374 between Hog Creek
to the east and an unnamed tributary to La J arita Creek to the west. However, 41MC375
is south and at a slightly lower elevation than 41MC374. This site consists of the surface
scattering of debitage, bifaces, cores, and burned rock in an area 850 meters north-south
by 600 meters east-west. Concentrations or localized accumulations of artifacts resulting
from sheetwash erosion are formed by materials transported from steeper to more level
positions along the interfluves. Again, material is primarily found on the surface except
where vertical displacement has occurred due to large cracks in the clays or slight burial
by colluvial materials during periods of heavy runoff. Two temporally diagnostic dart
point types were recovered - Palmillas and Fairland - indicating Middle and Late Archaic
occupations of the site area.
The area also contains historic debris related to the corral and field house located at the
south end of the site. According to Mr. Tommy Henry, these buildings were erected in
the 1960s to lodge ranch workers. Structural features consistent with this modern age
include a smoothed concrete pad and floor; wire finishing nails; painted particle board
siding; and aluminum frame windows. Thus, the historic component of 41MC375 fails to
meet the 50 year age requirement for site recording and lacks significance according to
National Register of Historic Places criteria.
~

41MC376

Site 41MC376 is an open campsite located along the left (east) bank of La Jarita Creek.
The site area extends from the creek bank to the gently sloping lower portion of the
interfluves between La Jarita and Cow Creeks. Cultural material was distributed over
an area measuring 450 meters north-south by 900 meters east-west and consisted of
debit age cores, bifaces, and burned rock. Concentrations of cultural material were noted
across this expanse and these tended to occur more frequently in the areas along La Jarita
Creek. The observed increased density can be attributed to occupational preference and
to the downslope movement of artifacts due to sheetwash erosion.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered consist of one example each of the following
types: Nueces biface, Early Triangular dart point, Angostura dart point base, and
Guadalupe tool. Utilization of the site area is thus attributed, but not limited, to the Late
Paleo indian, Early Archaic, and Middle to Late Archaic periods.
Although 41MC376 was evaluated as holding very low potential for intact archeological
deposits, as a precautionary measure, clearing and grading for construction of a spillway
across the site was monitored. No buried deposits, features or diagnostic artifacts were
unearthed and the cultural material noted consisted largely of debitage.

238 I APPENDIX 1

41MC377

Site 41MC377 is an open campsite located 100 meters west of Hog Creek on the gently
sloping interfluve between Hog Creek and an unnamed tributary to La Jarita Creek. The
site consists of lithic materials including debitage, biface fragments, burned rock, and
cores distributed on the surface over an area measuring 66 meters north-south by 70
meters east-west. In addition to lithic materials, the site contained the intentionally
shaped half-shell of a freshwater mussel. The shell retained the hinge portion, permitting
species identification. This artifact was made from the freshwater mussel Lampsillas teres
which is found in permanent water sources, a habitat common in nearby La Jarita Creek
(Neck, Appendix 3). No temporally diagnostic tool types were found.
41MC378

Site 41MC378 is an open campsite located on the right (west) bank of La Jarita Creek
approximately 1.5 kilometers upstream from the confluence with Hog Creek. Cultural
material consisting of debitage, cores, bifaces, unifaces, mussel shell, sandstone metate,
and burned rock is distributed across the surface over an area 150 meters north-south by
60 meters east-west. The recent gUllying in areas adjacent to La Jarita Creek has
concentrated the artifactual materials in the deflated areas, providing a skewed impresÂ­
sion of higher artifact densities along the creek. However, shovel probing in undeflated
areas near the creek and at distances from the creek show that the cultural material is
evenly, and rather sparsely, scattered. Shovel probing also indicated that areas immediÂ­
ately adjacent to the creek have a thin alluvial mantle 5 to 10 cm thick burying the cultural
materials. Shovel probing was unable to determine if the cultural material under this
mantle was contextually intact or if sheetwash erosion had displaced the materials prior
to their burial. Temporally diagnostic tool forms recovered from surface scatters include
one Perdiz arrow point, one denticulate Scallom arrow point, and one Ensor dart point.
These projectile point types indicate that the site was utilized at least during the Late
Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. A triangular dart point similar to the
Matamoros type was recovered during subsequent assessment of the site, thus confirming
the Late Archaic utilization of the site.
41MC379

Site 41MC379 is on the right bank of La Jarita Creek approximately 200 meters upstream
from 41MC378. Cultural material including debitage cores and burned rock was scatÂ­
tered over the surface of an area 60 meters north-south by 60 meters east-west. The
surface scatter is separated from the present creek bank by a gentle swale formed on the
back side of a natural levee caused by overbank flooding as the stream channel cut to the
east. The alluvial sandy levee deposits contained a buried, partially intact burned rock
feature eroding from the stream bank, where a deeply incised cattle trail cut into the side
of a basin-shaped hearth with burned rock and charcoal. The bottom of the feature was

with firing of the hearth. Slumping of the surface above the feature made it difficult to
determine the exact depth of the mouth of the pit but a tentative measurement of 15 cm
below surface is estimated. The interior bottom of the feature measures 30 cm below the
surface. The face of the incised cattle trail was cleaned to calculate the approximate long
dimension of the feature at 80 cm. Half of the hearth has been disturbed by tree roots,
but the remaining portion, including the segment profiled, indicates the feature was
probably circular in outline. Charcoal recovered during the wall cleaning and profiling
was sufficient for radiocarbon assay. The sample was submitted to the University ofTexas
Radiocarbon Laboratory. The resultant age of970Â± 50 (TX 6018) calibrates to a 1-Sigma
range of A.D. 998 to 1153 with a centroid of A.D. 1025 (Stuiver and Becker 1986). This
date is most useful in assessing the rate of alluviation that buried Feature 1.
The feature has been flagged for field identification as approximately one-third of the
hearth remains buried in the alluvial levee deposits. Intensified cutbank scrutiny failed
to locate other obvious buried features but a possible living surface may be represented
by debitage at the same general level along the levee for a distance of 4 meters to the
south. The site contains the only demonstrably intact cultural materials of any site
recorded by the survey of the additional 800 acre tract.
41MC380
Site 41MC380 is an open campsite located on the upland interfluve between La Jarita
Creek to the west and an unnamed tributary to La Jarita Creek to the east. Only a small
portion of the site area is contained within the proposed project area. A surface scatter
of debitage, cores, and utilized flakes, with one triangular biface, covered an area 150
meters east-west by 50 meters north-south. The remainder of the site extends an undeterÂ­
mined distance to the north outside the perimeter of the survey area. No temporally
diagnostic tool forms were recovered, thus no specific time periods of occupation can be
estimated.
41MC381
Site 41MC381 is located on a gravel-strewn interfluve along the right valley margin of La
Jarita Creek in the southwest corner of the prospect. The site extends beyond the
boundaries of the project area for an undetermined distance. The area of the site
contained in the prospect consists of a surface scatter of debitage, cores, thick bifaces,
one Guadalupe tool and one Nueces biface found in an area 185 meters north-south by
170 meters east-west. The Guadalupe and Nueces tool forms indicate use of this site
during at least Early Archaic and Middle to Late Archaic times. No buried materials
were uncovered in the clay and gravelly deposits.

240 I APPENDIX 1

Previously Recorded Sites

In addition to the 10 newly recorded prehistoric sites, this survey redefined the bounÂ­
daries of 3 previously recorded sites. Site 41MC364, 41MC366, and 41MC367 extend
into the newly surveyed 800-acre tract. These extensions did not substantially change the
descriptions of these sites nor their significance. Testing of one ofthe sites, 41MC367, is
described in the body of this report.
RECOMMENDATIONS

For the most part, the 10 sites recorded during this intensive pedestrian survey mirror
the site types, settings and content of the 41 sites recorded during the 1985 survey. The
majority are surficial scatters of burned rock, lithic debris, and occasional formal tools
representing comingled occupational detritus of the past 10,000 years. These sites are
resting upon Eocene clays with little probability that the cultural deposits were ever
protected by soil development (Caran, Chapter 3).
A representative sample of similar sites was surface collected as part of the Phase III
testing program to determine National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility.
In the 800-acre tract, only sites 41MC378 and 41MC379 deviate from the established
pattern in that they retain some potentially intact cultural deposits buried under alluvium
derived from overbank flooding of La Jarita Creek (Caran, Chapter 3). Of the two
41MC379 is more likely to meet NRHP criteria by yielding information relevant to
regional research problems. The demonstrated potential for buried features, preservaÂ­
tion of organic materials suitable for radiocarbon assay, and stratigraphic integrity at
41MC379 should be explored through a program of subsurface testing in the alluvial
deposits along the creek if mining plans include direct disturbance to this site.

THE MASPERO HOUSE, 41MC364
Dan K. Utley

The only historic site recorded during the 1985 survey was the Burmeister Ranch comÂ­
plex, the ruins of a ranchstead that overlap the prehistoric component of 41MCI02
(Nightengale et al. 1988). During review of the mine permit application, the Texas
Historical Commission requested further evaluation of the Maspero ranch, an extant
house and outbuildings located on prehistoric site 41MC364. An archival search and
owner interviews (Maspero, personal communication, 1988) were conducted by Dan K.
Utley to assess the significance of the site.
RESULTS OF HISTORIC RESEARCH
The Val Maspero House is situated on a 320 acre farm tract northeast of Tilden in
McMullen County. In deed records, it is referred to as Farm Tract No. 6565 of Farm Block
No. 251. The site was part of the 95,000 acre holdings of Dr. Charles F. Simmons during
the first decade of the twentieth century. Simmons, a prominent land speculator in South
Texas, subdivided his massive landholdings into small tracts, some containing only 10 to
20 acres. Because the latter were frequently sold "sight unseen" as valuable farm land,
despite such major drawbacks as inadequate water supply, unsuspecting buyers were
labeled "Simmons suckers".
Simmons conveyed Farm Tract No. 6565 to Louis Bierschwale on December 15, 1909
(McMullen County Deed Records: Vol. 0, P. 154). Although the Bierschwales were
residents of Boerne, in Kendall County, they evidently made several improvements to
the property, including the addition of at least two houses for workers or renters. One,
a long frame structure which stood directly south of the present house, was damaged
severely by termites in the late 1940s and subsequently razed. A recent shed was
constructed on top of the site. The second cabin, located approximately 50 yards southÂ­
west of the present house, was still extant in the 1940s, but was dismantled for scrap
lumber. Remaining materials were either bulldozed or hauled away and a cistern at the
site was filled in to prevent accidents or injuries. The only individuals known to have
lived there were Otto and Amos Hecker, tenant farmers.
Valentine Maspero, Jr. purchased the farm tract in February 1946 (McMullen County
Deed Records: Vol. 38, P. 513). He and his wife lived in the long frame house only a
short time before moving to other houses provided by the ranches for which he worked.
In the early 1950s, they decided to return to their land. Since the structures on the site
did not provide adequate living conditions, they decided to build their own cabin.
Completed in 1952, the house was approximately 18 x 30 feet and included a bath, closet,
bedroom, and kitchen/living area. The Masperos constructed the house using lumber

241

242 I APPENDIX2

from the demolished home of Dick DeBardeleben, an old trail driver of some local note
who had lived within a few miles of their farm. New materials came from suppliers in
Jourdanton.
About four years ago, the Masperos made several dramatic changes to the cabin. They
added a wing to the east, more than doubling the original footprint. With the addition,
the rectangular cabin evolved into a modified L-plan configuration with a porch extendÂ­
ing the entire length of the south (primary) facade. With additional changes, including
brickwork, a concrete foundation, iron support posts, and a standing-seam tin roof, the
design reflected the popular "ranch style" of twentieth-century architecture. An element
that is representative of earlier homesteads, but that is also representative of the droughtÂ­
prone region, is the cistern located on the northeast side of the house. Water remains an
unreliable resource, although the Masperos do have one producing well that was brought
in at the 3800' level.
Mr. Maspero is of Italian and Spanish descent. His grandfather (first name unknown)
was a native of Milan, Italy, and his maternal ancestors were members of the Canary
Islanders settlement at San Antonio.
RECOMMENDATIONS

Three facts garnered from archival research and owner interviews contribute to the
history of the San Miguel Prospect. The unimproved property once formed part of the
holdings of speculator Charles Simmons, an entrepreneur whose land dealings are part
of local legend. The current house and outbuildings stand atop an older twentieth century
building site, the previous structures razed or dismantled. In addition, the modern
Maspero house was partially constructed from materials salvaged from the home of Dick
DeBardeleben, another character of local importance.
Despite these contributions to local history, the Maspero ranchstead does not meet
architectural or historical criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
With the exception of the reused lumber, the current ranch buildings are all less than 50
years old. Neither the core of the modern house nor the 1980s renovations are of
exceptional architectural merit. The archeological potential of the earlier twentieth
century tenant house and outbuildings has been seriously depleted by the construction
of the operating ranch headquarters atop their demolished sites. In addition, the material
culture should reflect a twentieth century occupation, the deposits mirroring those at
41MCI02, the Burmeister Ranch, outside the current permit area. The description of
prehistoric site 41MC364 has been expanded to include the Maspero ranch as an historic
component but, in our opinion, additional research is not merited given the current
condition of the site deposits.

MOLLUSCAN REMAINS FROM THE SAN MIGUEL PROSPECT
Raymond W. Neck

Little is known concerning the modern molluscan fauna of the northern margin of the
South Texas Plains. The molluscan fauna is limited in species diversity and number of
individuals because of the hot, sub-humid to semi-arid climatic regime that characterizes
the area. The living freshwater molluscs of the Nueces River drainage have been
surveyed by Taylor (1974), but his study remains unpublished. The freshwater bivalves
of the streams draining into Baffin Bay (south of the Nueces drainage) have been
reported by Neck (1987). No comprehensive study of the terrestrial gastropods of this
area exists, but the droughty soils of this area limit the number of species that are to be
expected.
Studies of molluscan assemblages from archeological sites in the northern margins of the
Gulf Coastal Plain are also very limited. However, Murray (1982) reported extensive
samples from sites in the Choke Canyon Reservoir area.
METHODS AND RESULTS

A limited number of molluscan shells that were recovered from cultural proveniences in
the San Miguel Lignite Mine Project were provided to this author for identification and

with an environmental geographical classification from Nightengale et al. (1988).
Two terrestrial gastropods were included in the current samples, Rabdotus altematus and
Polygyra texasiana. Rabdotus altematus is a large terrestrial snail that is found in woodÂ­
lands and open brush communities. Nightengale (this report) found evidence of
consumption of R. altematus by Native Americans at site 41MC362. Numerous large
unbroken shells, some of which were charred, were found in strata containing lithic
cultural materials. Other local occurences of this species are described in greater detail
later in this section. Polygyra texasiana is normally found in seasonally moist woodlands.
However, in areas with sandy soil, P. texasiana is able to survive in more open brushy
habitats as long as downed wood is sufficient to provide protected retreats during drought
periods.

......Plan orb ella trivolvis also recovered

A single freshwater snail, Planorbella trivolvis. and an unidentified succineid were repreÂ­
sented in the modern samples provided by Car an. Plan orb ella trivolvis is typically found
in ponded or slow-moving water on mud substrates; waters may be quite turbid. The size
of the single modern specimen indicates that a permanent floodplain pond or stock tank
is the likely modern habitat of this species in this area.
Five species of freshwater bivalves are represented in samples from the San Miguel
Lignite Mine Project.
Cyrtonaias tampicoensis is a species of the southwestern Gulf Coastal Plain which ranges
from the central Mexican Gulf Coast northward into the United States with the northÂ­
ernmos t native popUlations occurring in the Brazos River drainage of north central Texas.
C. tampicoensis is found on sandy and mud substrates of streams and floodplain ponds
with permanent water.
Lampsilis teres is a species of the Mississippi River drainage and the northwestern Gulf
Coastal Plain as far south as the Rio Grande drainage in northeastern Mexico. L. teres
is found in permanent streams with mud or sand substrate.
Potamilus purpuratus is another species that is typical of the Mississippi River drainage
and the western Gulf Coastal Plain. However, the southern geographical limit of P.
purpuratus is the Nueces River drainage of Texas. P. purpuratus is found in streams with
permanent water flow over sand and mud substrates.

248 I APPENDIX 3

Toxolasma texasensis ranges from portions of the Mississippi River drainage westward
through Texas to certain spring-run tributaries of the ~io Grande drainage. T. texasensis
is found in small streams and ponds with low velocity currents.
Uniomerus declivus ranges over most of the Gulf Coastal Plain of the southern United
States and southwestward into the Rio Grande drainage of extreme northeastern Mexico.
U. declivus is typically found in temporary streams, backwater sloughs, and pools that
periodically go dry. Individuals of this species are able to survive in the dry substrate of
streams and ponds for several months.
Significance of Aquatic Bivalves

Most of the molluscan shells recovered from these sites are cultural items. Some of the
bivalve shells are charred and others have the posterior margin removed. Both condiÂ­
tions indicate use of the bivalves as food, although shells may become charred after or
without cultural utilization. No modifications were noted in the general collection of
shell material (Tables 23), but two modified pieces of Lampsilis teres shell were examined
by this author on 4 April 1988 (shell artifacts were from site 41MC377 in the 1988
Extended San Miguel Lignite Survey Area (Appendix 1Â».
The low species diversity in these assemblages is indicative of the location of these sites
on small order, seasonal streams in an environment that is not hospitable for most
freshwater mollusks. Significantly, the assemblage with the most species came from
41MC362 which is located on a creekside terrace (actually a natural levee). Sites further
from the present water courses contain fewer species of freshwater bivalves, apparently
representing reduced reliance on these streams for food sources. Several of the upland
creekside sites contained only Uniomerus declivuswhich would be found in the uppermost
stream reaches that occasionally hold pools of water. However, 41MC381, a creekside
upland site, contains species typical of perennial streams, because this site is located near
La J arita Creek, a larger stream. Such a relationship indicates that bivalves did not
originate very far from these sites.
The occurrence of Lampsilis teres, Cyrtonaias tampicoensis and Potamilus purpuratus in
these samples indicates that during the period of site occupancy held dependable water
supplies during all times of the year. The dependable water supply may have been due
to higher precipitation. Alternately, streams may have been maintained by more equable
water input through seeps from local alluvial aquifers. The former intact grassland
community may have absorbed runoff more effectively than does the present sparse
chapparal. Water would have been slowly released to lower soil levels and into the
shallow aquifers, maintaining dependable discharge.
The occurrence of Cyrtonaias tampicoensis in these cultural assemblages is significant in
relation to previous reports of living molluscan faunas in this region. C. tampicoensis is
common in the lower reaches of the Nueces River system, but this species is not known
from the drainage of San Miguel Creek today. Only Anodonta imbecilis and Toxolasma
texasensis are found in San Miguel Creek (Taylor ms). Murray (1986) reported C.
tampicoensis an archeological site along Chiltipin Creek in Jim Wells County. A modern
survey of the bivalves of the Baffin Bay drainage including Chiltipin Creek (Neck 1987)

APPENDIX3 I 249

revealed C. tampicoensis only in a reservoir and this record probably indicated a seconÂ­
dary occurrence by modern human transport. The presence of valves of C. tampicoensis
in these sites at the San Miguel Project indicate that this species exhibited a wider
distribution during prehistoric times (at some time during the middle and late Holocene)
than at present. C. tampicoensis during these times existed at sites further upstream than
present upstream limits.
Rabdotus alternatus in Roadrunner Middens

On February 19, 1988, S. C. Caran photographed (Fig. 9), described, and sampled a pile
of broken shells of the South Texas tree snail, Rabdotus altematus. Several concentraÂ­
tions of shell fragments were found in the project area, each of which was centered on
one or more siliceous (chert, quartzite, or silicified wood) cobbles lying on exposed
Eocene mudstone or clayey soil. Evidently, the shells had been broken against the
cobbles to allow a predator easy access to the snails inside. The shell debris consisted of
the remains of large individuals, indicating selective predation on this snail. The predator
was the Greater roadrunner, Geococcyx califomianus, which is known to prey on R.
altematus and other species of terrestrial snails in South Texas and elsewhere.
Rabdotus altematus ranges from northern Mexico into Texas as far north as the northern
edge of the South Texas Plains and as far west as Big Bend National Park (Fullington and
Pratt 1974). This species is found in open woodlands and savannahs. The density of
modern populations is generally low, but localized high-density colonies were once
common (Hubricht 1960). Today, such colonies are rare and appear to be restricted to
nature preserves and or protected areas (Neck in press). Little is known concerning the
life history this snail. Eggs are laid in the soil during activity periods linked to seasonal
rainfall events. The majority of the life of an individual adult snail is spent in a state of
aestivation sealed to the trunk or branch of a tree.
Geococcyx califomianus is common in open woodlands and savannahs of northern Mexico
and the southwestern United States (Oberholser 1974). The geographic range and
population density of this species have increased during the twentieth century Texas as a
result of clearing woodlands in southern and central Texas and forests in eastern Texas.
A large, ground-dwelling member of the Cuckoo Family, G. califorianus nests in low forks
of shrubs and trees in brushy thickets. Dominant items in the diet of this predatory bird
are lizards, snakes, insects, snails, and fruits (Oberholser 1974:212). Bryant (1916:35)
found no snails in stomachs of G. califorianus in California. Sutton (1922:18) reported
that snails were "often eaten, shells and all, though the shell was sometimes crushed" by
G. califomianus in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. These snails were "very common
on the prairie vegetation, [but] were ordinarily passed by, on account of abundance of
other food." The snail mentioned in this report was not identified, but was apparently
Rabdotus mooreanus, which is morphologically very similar to R. altematus.

Several observations have been published concerning the breakage of shells of terrestrial
gastropods by G. califorianus. McCall (Baird et aI. 1874:474) reported that terrestrial
gastropods in Texas were taken by G. califorianus "either from the ground or a branch
and carried to a particular spot, where the shell is broken and its contents eaten. Piles

250 I APPENDIX3

of these shells are often found thus collected in places frequented by them." Other
reports of G. califorianus breaking open shells of large snails on stones include Dobie
(1939), Holdsworth (1969:202), and Hester (1975). However, these observations were
made in areas south of the San Miguel Prospect, where there are limestone or sandstone
substrates. In the present study area, suitable substrates are limited to siliceous cobbles
within and downslope from upland gravel deposits (see discussion by Caran, this report).
The term "anvil" is here used to refer to the stone on which shells are broken. Sheppard
(1951) introduced the term "thrush anvil" to describe stones on which the Song thrush
(Turdus philomelos) of Europe breaks shells of land snails of the genus Cepaea
(Helicidae).
In addition to the roadrunner, other shell-breaking vertebrate predators of R. alternatus
include the hook-billed kite, Chondrohierax uncinatus, and the Southern Great Plains
wood rat, Neotoma micropus. Patterns of shell breakage are readily distinguished and
are diagnostic of each of these predators (Neck n.d.a). Some Native Americans also used
large individuals of R. alternatus and other snails as food (Neck 1981). Shells of snails
eaten by humans commonly, but not invariably (Hester and Hill 1975), exhibit heat
damage: charring, resulting from direct contact with flames, and/or slaking, resulting
from boiling or perhaps roasting. In addition, there is relatively little breakage, probably
because soft parts were easily extracted after cooking, using a mesquite thorn cactus spine
or similar object (see Hester and Hill 1975; Hester 1975). Characteristic breakage
patterns and heat damage differentiate shells of snails consumed by humans from those
eaten by other predators.
Utilization of hard substrates by G. califorianus to break shells is probably an outgrowth
of this species' normal response to prey in its mouth. When captured, prey are often
shaken or beaten on the ground (Sutton 1922; Dobie 1939:9; Bent 1940:46 et seq.; and
Oberholser 1974:437). Ground beating immobilizes prey and has been shown to be a
selective behavioral trait. For example, mice are often predated by G. califorianus and
the greater its body weight, the more times a mouse is beaten (Beal and Gillam 1979).
Even after hunger is satiated, small prey, which would not normally be beaten, are taken
and subjected to this treatment, indicating this behavior may be a form of "play and
exploration." Such exploration could lead to utilization of stones as anvils to break open
hard shells of terrestrial gastropods. G. califorianus has been observed beating shells of
R. alternatus against oil pipes at Welder Wildlife Refuge, Aransas County, Texas (J. Folse
personal communication, 17 December, 1985) and against concrete nature trail markers
and paved park roads at Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park in Hidalgo County, Texas
(Neck n.d.b).
Nothing is known at this time regarding the distance from which G. califomianus will
transport a living R. altematus to an anvil or other suitable substrate. T. philomelos
generally carry Cepaea sp. less than ten meters (Sheppard 1951; Morris 1954). Dobie
(1939:11) remarks that G. califorianus will "bring snail after snail to the rock he has
selected. . .passing scores of other rocks on the way." In contrast, Hester (1975) noted
three or more anvils in each of several areas 10 meters in diameter. Fidelity to a
particular anvil site has been observed in T. philomelos by Morris (1954), who attributed
this behavior to reliance on a site initially chosen for convenience. Certainly, anvil sites
in the San Miguel Prospect are chosen by G. califomianus not merely for convenience

APPENDIX 3 I 251

but by necessity, in that few suitable substrates exist locally. However, local spatial
distribution of cobbles utilized as anvils by G. califorianus is such that the distance of
transport is short, probably only several dekameters.
SUMMARY

Molluscan shell remains indicate that the inhabitants of these archeological sites conÂ­
sumed freshwater bivalves as food items and modified some shells as tools or ornaments.
Bivalve mollusks appear to have been collected from the nearest water course rather than
having been transported from a further distant, larger stream. Bivalve species repreÂ­
sented in these assemblages required more dependable water supplies than are present
in local streams today.
One species of terrestrial gastropod, Rabdotus alternatus, may have been used as food by
Native Americans at site 41MC362 and perhaps elsewhere. At 41MC362, large unbroken
shells of this species, some of which are charred, are common in strata containing lithic
cultural materials. Accumulations of snail shell fragments are common throughout the
project area today but result from nonhuman predation. The Greater roadrunner breaks
shells of large individuals of this snail by repeatedly hitting them against a cobble. Shell
fragmentation and absence of heat damage are good indications of animal consumption
of snails. Humans also selected large snails but generally cooked them by boiling or
roasting, often producing heat damage, and extracted the cooked snails with little or no
fragmentation of their shells.

APPENDIX 4

PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS
Michael Marchbanks

Phytoliths are outlines of plant cells formed by the deposition of silica absorbed from
groundwater. Because they are composed of silica, phytoliths are almost indestructible
and can be used to indicate paleoenvironments and possible climatic changes over time
(or plant utilization within the site), in environments that are not conducive to pollen
preservation. Among the many problems associated with phytolith identification are
variations in size and shape within individual plants and species, and possible redeposiÂ­
tion. However, there are several major categories in grasses that indicate classes in which
the ratios of phytoliths are affected by environmental conditions.
The three main classes of grasses are: Pooideae, Chloridoid, and Panicoid. The Pooideae
class is characteristic of grasses that prefer cooler climates and winter rainfall. These are
often called the wintergrasses, and are not considered within this report. The Chloridoid
class is characteristic of arid environments with summer rainfall and warm environments.
They include the short and mid-range grasses. The Panicoid class is characteristic of
mesic grasslands with summer rainfall, including tall grass prairies. These grasses prefer
humid, tropical to subtropical environments with moisture also limiting their range and
concentration. For this report the Chloridoid and Panicoid classes are considered.
However, the counts for all the major classes, types, and shapes are on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.
In order to be able to utilize the shifts in phytolith category rations, a soil sample column
must be taken at tight intervals. The soil sample needs to contain approximately 50 grams
of soil, taken from as small (vertically) an area as possible to eliminate possible conÂ­
tamination, and allow for other samples to be taken below it. The soil samples from the
San Miguel testing project were taken from soil zones exposed either in a backhoe trench
or test unit and were not specifically collected for phytolith analysis. Therefore, the full
potential of the phytolith analysis could not be utilized from the soil samples provided.
The eleven samples examined for phytoliths were subdivided into two groups, the
phytoliths from 8 to 50 microns and those greater than 50 microns. Putting the different
sizes of phytoliths on different slides reduces the possibility of missing large phytoliths,
or of smaller phytoliths covered by the larger ones. However, the phytolith counts
include counts from both of the slides.

Since only the Chloridoid and Panicoid classes are considered in this report, between 120
and 180 phytoliths were counted from these 2 classes, and then the ratio of each class was
calculated and plotted (Table 24).

Despite the limitations imposed by sample collection strategies, some indications of the
potential of phytolith analysis can be seen. At site 41MC362 (slides 2-4) where samples
were taken at 31, 46, and 63 cm. below surface, there is a change in the ratios between
the Chloridoid and Panicoid classes, from 16.4 to 12.0 to 19.6% Panicoid class. This could
be an indication of environmental conditions; however, there would be more to support
this if more samples were taken. Another potential indication of environmental change
comes from 41MC367, where there is a large change in the class ratios between Zone 2
and 3 from 30.8 to 16.4% (Panicoid class), indicating the climate was drier in Zone 3 than
Zone 2. 41AT77 also reflects a large change in the grass class ratios from 8.3 to 32.4%
(Panieoid class), but the sample range from 0-5 and 0-20 em. below surface, and no
environmental data ean be determined because of the large vertical range that the
samples were taken from. Overall, the upland sites had a greater concentration of

APPENDIX 4 / 253

Panicoid class phytoliths (associated with tall grasses), while the lowland sites had a
greater concentration of the Chloridoid class.
In conclusion, there is a good potential for paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the San
Miguel project area where pollen is not preserved if phytolith sampling strategies are
included in the research design and strict field procedures are followed during collection.
