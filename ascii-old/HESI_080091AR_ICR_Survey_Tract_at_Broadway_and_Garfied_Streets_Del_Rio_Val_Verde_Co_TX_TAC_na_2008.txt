MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Flat Creek Development, LLC (FCD), is proposing to develop an approximately 0.4hectare (ha) (0.9-acre [ac]) tract in downtown Del Rio, Val Verde, Texas, for the General
Services Administration (GSA). The tract consists of a vacant lot paved in a mix of asphalt and
gravel that is bounded by Broadway Street on the northwest and by Garfield Street on the
southeast on the block between Griner Street to the southwest and South Main Street to the
northeast. The proposed project would be sponsored by the GSA, a federal agency; therefore,
the project would fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a federally sponsored undertaking
with the potential to impact significant cultural resources, FCD was required to provide for a
cultural resources inventory and assessment of the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE) and
to assess the project’s possible impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE. The
project’s APE consists of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) vacant lot.
To meet its responsibilities under the NHPA, FCD contracted with Horizon to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract situated between Broadway and Garfield
streets. In addition to the assessment of the lot itself, Horizon’s archeologist photographed
standing structures within one-half city block of the property to show what viewsheds of historic
buildings, if any, may be impacted by the proposed development of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract.
On July 1, 2008, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ac
(0.9-ac) vacant lot that comprises the APE and photographed standing structures located within
one-half city block of the property. Jeffrey D. Owens served as the Principal Investigator for the
project and Reign Clark served as project archeologist. The cultural resources investigation
consisted of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the APE, and photodocumentation of standing structures within one-half city block of the vacant lot. The purpose of
the survey was to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed construction project.
The 0.4-ac (0.9-ac) tract on which proposed construction would occur consists of a
vacant lot paved with mixed asphalt and gravel. No in situ soils are present on this lot, and it
possesses no potential to contain any intact archeological deposits. No cultural resources,
historic or prehistoric, were identified on the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract as a result of the survey.

Management Summary

The Roswell Hotel is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the
corner of Garfield and Griner streets. Constructed in 1926, the Roswell Hotel, now the Roswell
Apartments, consists of a 6-story brick structure with first-floor commercial storefronts.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Handbook 2008), the Roswell Hotel was used as a
hospital by the controversial medical charlatan, broadcaster, and political candidate Dr. John
Brinkley from 1933 to 1938. While the Roswell Hotel is not listed on the NRHP, the eligibility of
the Roswell Hotel for inclusion in the NRHP apparently has never been formally assessed.
Other standing structures within one-half block of the APE include a 2-story apartment
building on the southwest side of Griner Street, a municipal building and a private residence on
the northwest side of Broadway Street, and various other modern buildings. Texas Historical
Commission (THC) files contained a record of a T-shaped, possibly adobe, structure
supposedly built in 1926 located at 407 Griner Street at the corner of Griner and Broadway
streets; however, the field reconnaissance of the one-half-block area surrounding the APE
revealed that this structure is no longer extant.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) APE as a result of survey activities,
and no listed historic properties are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking. As noted above, the Roswell Hotel,
constructed in 1926, is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the corner of
Garfield and Griner streets. While the Roswell Hotel is not listed on the NRHP, the eligibility of
the Roswell Hotel for inclusion in the NRHP apparently has never been formally assessed.
Nonetheless, as the surrounding neighborhood consists of an urban setting with numerous
multiple-story modern structures, it is Horizon’s opinion that construction on the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac)
lot that comprises the APE would not result in any viewshed impacts to adjacent historic-age
buildings.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the GSA and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a 0.9-Acre Tract
Between Broadway and Garfield Streets, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Flat Creek Development, LLC (FCD), is proposing to develop an approximately 0.4hectare (ha) (0.9-acre [ac]) tract in downtown Del Rio, Val Verde, Texas, for the General
Services Administration (GSA). The tract consists of a vacant lot paved in a mix of asphalt and
gravel that is bounded by Broadway Street on the northwest and by Garfield Street on the
southeast on the block between Griner Street to the southwest and South Main Street to the
northeast (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed project would be sponsored by the GSA, a federal
agency; therefore, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a federally
sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact significant cultural resources, FCD was
required to provide for a cultural resources inventory and assessment of the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE) and to assess the project’s possible impacts on any significant cultural
resources in the APE. The project’s APE consists of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) vacant lot.
To meet its responsibilities under the NHPA, FCD contracted with Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct a cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ha
(0.9-ac) tract situated between Broadway and Garfield streets. In addition to the assessment of
the lot itself, Horizon’s archeologist photographed standing structures within one-half city block
of the property to show what viewsheds of historic buildings, if any, may be impacted by the
proposed development of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if any archeological and/or historical sites are located within the APE, and, if any exist, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
On July 1, 2008, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ac
(0.9-ac) vacant lot that comprises the APE and photographed standing structures located within
one-half city block of the property. Jeffrey D. Owens served as the Principal Investigator for the
project and Reign Clark served as Project Archeologist. The cultural resources investigation
consisted of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the defined APE, and photodocumentation of standing structures within one-half city block of the vacant lot, and the
production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA’s) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports. The cultural resource investigations were conducted by
Horizon under subcontract to FCD.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the proposed project area forms part of the Edwards Plateau. The surface
geology of Val Verde County, Texas, consists of sedimentary bedrock derived from deposits of
different geologic periods. The Edwards Plateau is underlain by Cretaceous limestone deposits
of the Comanche and Gulf series (Golden et al. 1982). In general, these limestones are highly
resistant to erosion, but in the vicinity of the junction of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio
Grande, the uplifted and inclined limestone strata are severely eroded and deeply dissected by
narrow stream courses that are bound by steep cliff faces. In recognition of the unique
physiography of this region, it has been termed the Lower Pecos Canyonlands (Hester et al.
1989).
The project area is situated on the uplands overlooking the Rio Grande on the Lower
Cretaceous Salmon Peak Limestone Formation (Fisher 1977). The project area is situated on
2 soil map units defined by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) (NRCS 2008).
The eastern two-thirds of the project area (i.e., the northwest-to-southeast-oriented portion of
the lot extending between Garfield and Broadway streets) are situated on Coahuila clay loam,
0 to 3% slopes (CoB). The northwestern one-third of the project area (i.e., the northwestern
corner of the lot extending along Broadway Street toward Griner Street) is situated on Reynosa
silty clay loam (Ra). Both of these soil units consist of calcareous loamy alluvium found on
stream terraces on coastal plains. While the entire project area is mapped on alluvium, the lot
has been extensively modified by urban development and no natural soils are extant.

2.2

HYDROLOGY

The Lower Pecos Canyonlands region lies on the edge of the Pecos River drainage and
includes all of the Devils River drainage, both of which ultimately empty into the Rio Grande.
Generally, the availability of surface water in the vicinity of the project area has deteriorated
significantly throughout the past century. Numerous creeks and streams that occasionally carry
rainwater traverse the region and have created a deeply entrenched, rugged topography with a
great deal of relief, but natural springs and artificial wells provide the most reliable sources of
water. The nearest source of water prehistorically would have been San Felipe Creek, which is
located 575 meters (m) (1,886 feet [ft]) southeast of the project area.

2.3

FLORA AND FAUNA

Ecologically, the project area lies within the Balconian biotic province near the boundary
with the Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan provinces (Blair 1950). The most characteristic plant
association of the Balconian province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar, Texas oak, and scrub
live oak. Vegetation cover within the project area is minimal, consisting only of sparse weeds
and grasses that have taken root within an urban lot that is covered by a mix of asphalt and
gravel pavement.
The Balconian province is generally confined to the Edwards Plateau and is
characterized by a mixture of faunal elements from the Kansan, Austroriparian, Tamaulipan,
and Chihuahuan biotic provinces. The urban setting of the project area, however, provides poor
habitat for wildlife. No wildlife was observed in the project area during the survey.

2.4

CLIMATE

Val Verde County has a semiarid, continental climate with dry winters and hot summers.
Average annual precipitation is 46.7 centimeters (cm) (8.4 inches [in]), while daily temperatures
ranges from an average maximum of 37.3°Celsius (C) (99.2°Fahrenheit [F]) in July to an
average minimum of 3.4°C (38.1°F) in January. Absolute recorded extreme temperatures range
from 11.1 to 43.3°C (12.0 to 110.0°F).
Reconstruction of Late Quaternary Paleoenvironment in the vicinity of the project area
has been greatly facilitated by the location of several archeological sites along the Rio Grande
and the Pecos and Devils rivers. These sites include Arenosa Shelter (41VV99), Bonfire
Shelter (41VV218), Baker Cave (41VV213), Centipede Cave (41VV191), Damp Cave
(41VV189), Devil’s Mouth Cave (41VV188), and Hinds Cave (41VV456).
Geological,
palynological, macrobotanical, coprolitic, and faunal data from these sites have allowed
reconstruction of the Paleoenvironment from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Patton and Dibble 1982:97-121).
During the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 years before present [B.P.]),
the climate was cooler with more moisture than today. This helped to create a mosaic of
woodlands, pinyon parklands, and scrub grasslands with some juniper present. In the
succeeding Late Glacial period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), a reduction in the pinyon and juniper
woodlands is indicated by the pollen record. Bryant and Holloway (1985:52) suggest that this
vegetational change resulted from a reduced amount of available moisture as a result of
changing weather patterns brought about by glacial retreat.
Between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, the mosaic of vegetation of woodlands,
parklands, and scrub grasslands was gradually replaced by larger areas of scrub grasslands.
During this period, the frequency of fossil pine pollen decreased, while that of herbaceous plants
and grasses increased (Bryant and Holloway 1985:56). Plant remains recovered from Hinds
and Baker caves (Dering 1979) indicate that, by 8,500 B.P., local aboriginal groups were
exploiting a full range of plant resources, including Agave, Yucca, Dasylirion (sotol), and
Opuntia, all of which are associated with xeric environments.

Between Broadway and Garfield Streets, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

Examination of the plant macrofossil record (Dering 1979), the pollen record (Bryant and
Schafer 1977; Johnson 1963), and the faunal record (Lord 1984) suggests that, by 6,000 B.P.,
aboriginal groups were adjusting to vegetational and climatic conditions that were increasingly
drier (Bryant and Holloway 1985:57). During this same period (7,000 to 4,000 B.P.), southwest
Texas was also subjected to severe flooding as represented in the sediments of archeological
sites such as the Devil’s Mouth Site (Johnson 1964) and Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967).
Although the factors behind this erosion and flooding are not fully understood, changes in
seasonal rainfall patterns or shifts in the normal frontal patterns, as have been observed
historically, are the suspected causes.
The pollen record for the past 4,000 years indicates a gradual, but continuous, drying
trend that was interrupted only once, around 2,500 years ago, when increases in the
percentages of pine and grass pollen indicate somewhat cooler and more mesic conditions
(Bryant and Holloway 1985). This interval, however, was brief, and the trend toward increased
aridity continued until the present. The landscape as it appears today, however, is not the result
of increased aridity alone. Historic accounts of the early explorers and settlers reveal that the
canyon vegetation and even the upland grasslands were very lush prior to the overgrazing of
the region that began in the late 1880s. The basic subsistence pattern for the aboriginal
inhabitants of the region was therefore probably established as early as 7,000 B.P. and
changed very little throughout the Holocene period.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area forms a part of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, which represent a
portion of the Lower Pecos archeological region (Hester et al. 1989). This region includes the
area surrounding the confluences of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio Grande, and
encompasses the surrounding area of southwestern Texas and north-central Mexico, including
the southwestern extension of the Edwards Plateau and the eastern edge of the Stockton
Plateau. The Lower Pecos archeological region is part of the larger area known as the TransPecos, which was originally defined as including all of Texas west of the Pecos River plus Val
Verde County (Suhm et al. 1954). Archeologically, the Lower Pecos River region has been
defined on the basis of the distribution of the classic Pecos River style pictographs (Turpin and
Bement 1985:5).
The Rio Grande and the Pecos and Devils rivers have incised deep canyons into the
massive Cretaceous limestone deposits in this region, and multiple-canyon systems are quite
common. Erosional processes have also created numerous rockshelters and overhangs, some
of which are quite large, that have facilitated the development of deeply stratified archeological
sites. Most of the best-known sites in the area are located in these dry rockshelters and shallow
erosional cavities along the cliff faces overlooking the rivers (Hester et al. 1989:7).

3.1

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH

The rich prehistoric remains in the Lower Pecos River region have attracted public
interest since before the earliest map makers came to the area in the 1850s (Emory 1857;
Young 1853). Formal archeological investigations here have been restricted to approximately
the last 80 years, beginning in the 1930s with work funded by both private and academic
institutions. Much of the early work was aimed at the recovery of museum-quality specimens
from the dry caves and rockshelters of the area. Archeological investigations in the region have
undergone numerous methodological and theoretical changes within the last 50 years since
Amistad Reservoir was constructed. These more recent studies have attempted to explain the
cultural continuity and change reflected by the artifactual remains of the aboriginal inhabitants
rather than to merely seek out well-preserved perishables, as had been done previously.
Excavations begun in the early 1930s were sponsored by various institutions, including
the Witte Museum of San Antonio, the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Texas at Austin,
and Texas Technological University. Key sites excavated during this time period by the Witte

Museum were Eagle Cave (41VV167) near Langtry (Davenport 1938) and the Shumla caves
(41VV112 and 31VV113) near the small settlement of Shumla (Martin 1933). The Smithsonian
Institution promoted excavations at Goat Cave (41VV67) and Moorehead Cave (41VV55) along
the Pecos River throughout the 1930s (Setzler 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939). Personnel from
the University of Texas at Austin concentrated their efforts in this region on the trenching of Fate
Bell Shelter (41VV74) in Seminole Canyon in 1932 (Pearce and Jackson 1933; Thomas 1933)
and the excavation of Horseshoe Ranch Cave (41VV171) and Kelly Shelter (41VV164) by A.M.
Woolsey in 1936 (Shafer and Zintgraff 1986:228). Also at this time, Murrah Cave (41VV351) on
the Pecos River was excavated as part of Texas Technological University’s fieldwork in the area
(Holden 1937). These early excavations yielded an array of extremely well-preserved artifacts,
including wood specimens, mats, baskets, bone tools, sandals, antler implements, and skins, as
well as burials, many of which retained both skin and hair.
Also in the 1930s, several attempts were made to record the rock art in the region. The
first attempt was sponsored by the Witte Museum and was done by Emma Gutzeit and Mary
Virginia Carson in 1931. They crafted free-hand color copies of 18 of the more notable panels
in the area (Turpin 1982:19). Also at this time, Forrest Kirkland, a meticulous artist, and his wife
embarked on a mission to travel across Texas and record as much rock art as possible. Many
of the spectacular pictographs in the Lower Pecos region were included in Kirkland’s work,
which involved painstaking measurements and the use of matched watercolors (Kirkland 1937,
1938, 1939; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). A.T. Jackson’s Picture-Writing of Texas Indians
(1938) was the first formal archeological study of the pictograph and petroglyphs sites in the
area. He, like Kirkland, attempted a systematic documentation of the rock art sites. Jackson’s
and Kirkland’s work laid the groundwork for future research on the remarkable rock art in the
Lower Pecos River region.
During the 1940s, limited formal archeological investigations in the area were
undertaken as a result of World War II. Kelley et al. (1940) divided the Trans-Pecos region into
8 cultural foci based on material recovered from the Big Bend to the Lower Pecos. The Pecos
River focus was one of these foci for which a detailed list of material culture traits was
presented. This trait list was compiled using materials from Fate Bell Shelter, Murrah Cave,
Goat Cave, and Moorehead Cave. Fate Bell Shelter was listed as the type site. One of Kelly’s
students, Herbert Taylor, initiated limited excavations and surveys along both sides of the Rio
Grande (Taylor 1948, 1949). After performing a reconnaissance into northern Mexico, Taylor
concluded that “Pecos River Focus sites are to be found south of the Rio Grande near the
mouth of the Pecos in virtually the same locations and numbers in which they occur north of the
border” (1948:84). Taylor proposed that the Pecos River focus was present throughout the
Trans-Pecos region, from the Big Bend to the Lower Pecos, before A.D. 1000. He felt that,
around A.D. 1000, this cultural type abandoned the Big Bend but persisted in the Lower Pecos,
creating a long-lived cultural continuum there (Taylor 1949:86). Suhm et al. (1954) offered a
summary of the Lower Pecos cultural sequence using this background. Their summary placed
the Lower Pecos within the southeastern area of the Trans-Pecos.
The Water Treaty of 1944 between the US and Mexico initiated the next series of
investigations in the Lower Pecos region. This treaty provided for unusual cooperation in the

construction of reservoirs along the Rio Grande to alleviate flooding problems and to allow
storage of irrigation water for agricultural areas downstream. One of these reservoirs, Diablo
Reservoir (later renamed Amistad) would inundate an area from the confluence of the Rio
Grande with the Devils River and the Pecos River—and upstream on these 2 rivers for 30 and
20 miles (mi) (48 and 32 kilometers [km]), respectively—to a point about 1.2 mi (2.0 km)
downstream on the Rio Grande. The National Park Service was placed in charge of the
extensive cultural resources to be affected by the construction and filling of this reservoir
(Bement 1989). The Archeological Salvage Program Field Office was set up in Austin, Texas
(Graham and Davis 1958), and E.B. Jelks of the University of Texas at Austin was put in charge
of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project. The initial inventorying of cultural resources to be
adversely affected by the reservoir began in January 1958 (Jelks 1958). Areal survey, as well
as reconnaissance by raft along the Rio Grande, was used in the identification of sites. This
survey resulted in the recording of 188 archeological sites, of which 49 contained pictographs
(Graham and Davis 1958).
At this time, with the new-found concerns about the archeology of the area, some of the
material excavated in the 1930s was reanalyzed. Mardith Schuertz (1956, 1961, 1963)
conducted the most extensive reevaluations, looking at artifacts from Eagle Cave, the 5 Shumla
caves, and Jacal Cave (41VV674). She did a thorough study of the recovered sandals,
reanalyzed the projectile points using the formalized typology defined by Suhm et al. (1954),
and completed studies on the wood, bone, antler, stone (pecked, ground, and painted), shell,
clay, skins, fiber, basketry, and matting.
As a result of the 1958 survey of the Amistad Reservoir area, a 5-year program was
envisioned to test and excavate many of the recorded sites. This program actually lasted
through the late 1960s with a vast quantity of information being amassed. The first excavations
were done at Centipede Cave (41VV191) and Damp Cave (41VV189) in 1958 by Jeremiah
Epstein (1963). He felt that only the projectile points recovered showed any change through
time. The rest of the artifacts from these 2 sites showed little variability and were thought to be
part of a long-lived cultural continuum in the area.
Other work associated with the reservoir at this time included additional surveys along
the Pecos, Devils Mouth, and Rio Grande rivers in the US (Parsons 1962) and Mexico (Taylor
1948; Taylor and Rul 1961); excavations at rockshelters (Alexander 1970; Collins 1969; Dibble
1965; Nunley et al. 1965; Parsons 1965; Prewitt 1966; Ross 1965) and terrace sites (Dibble
1967; Johnson 1961, 1964; Sorrow 1968a, 1968b); and additional recording and analyzing of
pictograph sites (Gebhard 1965; Grieder 1965; Parsons 1962).
Dibble’s excavations at Bonfire Shelter (1965) identified 4 and possibly 5 human
utilizations of a bison jump there, with the earliest bone bed possibly due to human involvement
dated to before 10,000 years ago. Alexander’s excavations at Parida Cave (41VV187) along
the Rio Grande recovered human coprolites, identified 3 extensively used plant taxa (sotol,
lechuguilla, and prickly pear), and noted an increase in the utilization of riverine fauna during
Late Archaic times (Alexander 1970). Eagle Cave was partially excavated in 1963 by Ross
(1965), who developed a projectile point sequence for the site from the Early Archaic through
the Late Archaic. His relative sequence compared favorably with other site sequences from the

area. Most of the projectile point styles, however, occurred chronologically later than had been
hypothesized for the same styles from other sites (Ross 1965:139). Leroy Johnson (1961,
1964) began work at Devil’s Mouth Cave (41VV188), a deeply stratified alluvial deposit, in the
early 1960s. He established a projectile point sequence there identifying a PaleoIndian
component and 3 subsequent Archaic components. At the same time, Dee Ann Story proposed
an 8-period chronology using radiocarbon dates and associated projectile points from these
latest excavations (Story and Bryant 1966). William Sorrow returned to further excavate the
Devil’s Mouth site in 1967 (Sorrow 1968a) and also did work at the Nopal Terrace site
(41VV301) that same year (Sorrow 1968b). He further refined the cultural sequence for the
Amistad area using Johnson’s Devil’s Mouth data (Story and Bryant 1966) and shorter
sequences from 7 other sites in the area. Eight periods were established, with the first
7 mirroring the Devil’s Mouth sequence and the eighth representing the historic period of
European contact. The excavations at Arenosa Shelter (41VV99) by David Dibble (1967)
provided the longest cultural sequence of stratified, radiocarbon-dated episodes from the
reservoir to date. Dibble refined an 11-part chronology for the Lower Pecos region based on the
Arenosa sequence and the PaleoIndian data from Bonfire Shelter.
A relative chronology of the rock art in the area was proposed by David Gebhard in
1960. He based this chronology on similarities in style and superposition of motifs within a
panel (Turpin 1982). His final report in 1965 refined the chronology and included the analysis of
additional panels recorded by Parsons (1962). Terence Grieder (1965) also did some rock art
recording at this time. He visited 2 sites in Satan Canyon and concluded that all of the painting
had been done within a period of time marked by relatively minor changes in style and that none
of the painting appeared to be of a more recent age than any of the others (Grieder 1965:14).
The reservoir salvage years provided the archeological community with data of
immeasurable value about Lower Pecos prehistory. The absence of large-scale projects since
the salvage program ended has drastically reduced the number of archeological investigations
in this area. Funding for additional surveys and excavations in close proximity to the reservoir
has primarily been provided by grants and research organizations in recent years. The large
body of data from the salvage years in the Lower Pecos enabled some students to complete
theses and dissertations using excavated material (Collins 1974; Marmaduke 1978). Some
areas adjacent to the reservoir were surveyed in the 1970s to further refine the settlement
scheme for the area and to look at the spatial distribution of features (Brown et al. 1976;
Marmaduke and Whitsett 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974).
Several major rockshelter sites were excavated in the 1970s by academic institutions.
Baker Cave (41VV503) on the Devils River was excavated in the summer of 1976 by the
University of Texas at San Antonio (Chadderdon 1981; Hester 1983). This excavation yielded
both Angosture and Golondrina projectile point types dated to more than 9,000 years ago. The
excavated materials from Baker Cave indicated that lechuguilla and sotol were not part of the
flora during late PaleoIndian times. These plants apparently were not present in the region until
ca. 6000 B.C. (Hester 1983). Texas A&M University conducted excavations at Hinds Cave
(41VV456) along a tributary of the Pecos River over several seasons. This excavation provided
important data concerning the use of the area by the aboriginal occupants and their subsistence

base (Shafer and Bryant 1977). Also, intrasite information was obtained with the discovery of a
latrine area that provided coprolites for analysis and the location of the areas containing wellpreserved floral and faunal remains (Dering 1979; Lord 1984; Williams-Dean 1978). Wellpreserved perishable items, including matting, sandals, and basketry, were found to date back
roughly 5000 years (Andrews and Adovasio 1980). It was proposed that Hinds Cave was
occupied for extended periods of time lasting several seasons (Shafer 1977; Williams-Dean
1978).
A State Historical Park was created along Seminole and Presa canyons in 1979-1980
when various tracts of land either were donated by landowners or purchased by the State.
Many pictograph sites, including Fate Bell Shelter, were located within the park. The University
of Texas at Austin conducted an inventory of the cultural resources within the park for the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, locating 38 new sites and reevaluating 32 previously known
sites (Turpin 1982). Several new site types were identified during this survey, including signal
fire hearths, oblong burial cairns, and circular stone alignments (i.e., tipi rings) (Turpin 1982,
1984a]). One burial cairn was excavated during this project. A sinkhole, located during this
inventory, was later excavated using funding from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. A
rock pile beneath the vertical shaft entrance to the sinkhole was found to contain the remains of
at least 21 individuals (Bement 1985). This burial population was found to be more than
5,000 years old.
The lower levels of Bonfire Shelter were excavated as part of the 1983-1984
investigations conducted by the University of Texas at Austin. These excavations explored the
PaleoIndian levels and the levels immediately beneath them. Possible human activities in the
shelter between 12,500 and 10,000 B.P. were identified (Bement 1986).
During the 1980s, extensive survey for rock art sites along the 3 primary rivers in the
area was conducted to provide baseline data for future settlement pattern research (Turpin et al.
n.d.). Another excavation at this time was undertaken at Live Oak Hole (41VV169), a Historic
period aboriginal site (Turpin and Bement 1988). This tipi ring/historic pictograph site contained
brown plainware ceramics, arrow points, Dorso end scrapers, and a Plains style pictograph. A
continuous circular pile of stones (2 stones wide) located on the sloping nose of a creek
meander was excavated, but only a small concentration of burned rock was noted. Oblong
cairns are often associated with such circular alignments, and at this site these cairns were
interpreted as partial rings that had been robbed of stones for the construction of subsequent
structures (Turpin and Bement 1988).
In the mid-1980s, several areas near Hinds Cave were surveyed to develop a
subsistence model for upland areas in the region (Saunders 1986). Saunders concluded that
“formal uniface sites and projectile point sites were associated with separate and distinct
economic activities” (1986:227). He also postulated that large burned rock middens were
products of a Middle Archaic subsistence strategy, while smaller ones represented changing
strategies during the Late Archaic (Saunders 1986:228).
Much emphasis in the 1980s centered on rock art sites in the region (Turpin 1984b,
1986a, b, c, d, 1987, 1988). To date, 5 pictograph styles have been identified: Pecos River,

HJN 080091 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Red Linear, Red Monochrome, Bold Line Geometric, and Historic. The Pecos River style
appears to be the earliest and is thought to date to the Middle Archaic, San Felipe phase
(3,200 to 3,900 years B.P. [Turpin and Bement 1985]). The Red Linear portrays group activities
and is thought to be Late Archaic in age by Turpin (1984b:191-193) due to the lack of bow and
arrow motifs, probable buffalo hunting scenes, and superpositioning over Pecos River style
panels. The Red Monochrome style had been previously dated to the Late Prehistoric period
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:84) based on definite bow and arrow depictions. This style is
characterized by naturalistic depictions of humans and animals, with human figures shown
facing frontally and animals drawn in profile (Turpin 1986b). The most recently defined rock art
style has been termed the Bold Line Geometric style (Turpin 1986a). This style is thought to be
Late Prehistoric age, but this hypothesis is tentative. Historic pictographs represent 3 types of
scene: peaceful depictions of European people and associated material goods, hostilities
toward the Spanish, and hostilities toward Anglo-American settlers (Turpin 1988:283).
The Witte Museum recently developed a permanent exhibit on the Lower Pecos region
using material from the 1930s excavations at Baker Cave (Bement 1989). The Witte has also
sponsored a book, Ancient Texans (Shafer and Zintgraff 1986), which contains excellent color
plates of many rock art panels as well as the work of many researchers in the Lower Pecos.
In the summer of 1989, the Texas Archeological Society held its annual field school
along the Devils River on newly purchased Texas Parks and Wildlife land. The field school was
designed to help the state inventory the cultural resources present within the approximately
22,000-acre park and to test a number of sites. A total of 158 new sites was recorded, and
37 of the 52 known sites within the park boundaries were reevaluated. Five sites were tested
and/or excavated, including 2 rockshelters, 1 sinkhole/cave, and 2 midden sites. More recent
archeological studies in the area have consisted of small surveys conducted for cultural
resources management purposes.
In summary, much archeological work has occurred in the Lower Pecos River region in
the last 80 years and has led to the compilation of a vast database for the area. Future work in
the area will undoubtedly build on this database with specific problem-oriented studies
dominating the progress.

3.2

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY IN THE LOWER PECOS RIVER REGION

Numerous researchers have noted an apparent absence of significant technological or
cultural change throughout much of the prehistoric period in the Lower Pecos River region, with
the continuation of an “Archaic” mode of adaptation from the end of the PaleoIndian period at
about 7000 B.C. to the Historic period (Saunders 1986; Turpin 1982). Throughout this long
period of time, the economy was apparently based on collecting plant and shellfish resources
along with hunting small animals and large game.
Because of the excellent preservation conditions in the dry rockshelters, which were
apparently intermittently occupied throughout the prehistoric period, we have a relatively
complete inventory of the material culture of the prehistoric inhabitants. This inventory includes
baskets, various types of netting, bone tools, a wide variety of woven goods, such as bags and

14

Between Broadway and Garfield Streets, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

sandals, “middens” of burned rock that are presumed to relate to the preparation of plant foods,
and a large assemblage of lithic tools.
The perception of the conservative nature of this tradition derives largely from the lithic
industry, which consists of projectile points, bifaces, and unifacial tools. With the exception of
projectile point styles, the lithic assemblage changed little throughout most of the prehistoric
period (Saunders 1986). The most important shift in technology may have occurred around
A.D. 600, when the bow and arrow was introduced into the region, apparently accompanied by
a change in the morphological structure of burned rock middens (Saunders 1986).
As is to be expected given this apparent pattern of cultural conservatism, chronology in
the Lower Pecos River region is based almost entirely on the stylistic seriation of projectile
points that have been excavated from rockshelters and deeply stratified terrace sites in the
canyons. Such sites have provided a rather consistent sequence of projectile point styles that
can be bracketed by radiocarbon dates (Marmaduke 1978:Fig. 18). For our purposes, 4 major
periods of Native American occupation can be defined: PaleoIndian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Historic (Saunders 1986; Turpin and Bement 1985). The following discussion of these
cultural periods is, of necessity, brief and is limited only to the major innovations or traits that
can be firmly associated with specific points in time.
3.2.1

PaleoIndian Period (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.C.)

Two phases have been defined for the PaleoIndian period in the Lower Pecos River
region: the Aurora (pre-10,000 B.C.) and the Bonfire (10,000 to 7800 B.C.) phases (Saunders
1986; Turpin and Bement 1985). Evidence for the Aurora phase is rather circumstantial,
consisting only of scattered, broken, or burned bones of extinct Pleistocene fauna recovered
from 2 rockshelter sites: Cueva Quebrada (41VV162A) (Collins 1976; Lundelius 1984) and
Bonfire Shelter (Bement 1986; Dibble 1970; Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Turpin and Bement
1985:6). Formal tools and features are lacking from these deposits, and the only evidence for
human activity lies in the burning of the bones and the nature of the breakage patterns.
Unfortunately, such evidence elsewhere has often proved illusory and firm evidence for the
existence of this phase remains to be discovered. Radiocarbon dates associated with this
phase range from 12,000 to 10,000 B.C. at Cueva Quebrada and from 10,500 to 8000 B.C. at
Bonfire Shelter (Turpin and Bement 1985:6).
The later phase of the PaleoIndian period, the Bonfire phase, is well represented only at
Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). A massive bone deposit of extinct Bison antiques
and Equus sp. at this site has yielded radiocarbon dates of 10,000 years ago. The site is
estimated to contain the remains of 120 animals that were driven from the overhanging cliff in at
least 3 separate episodes. Two distinctive PaleoIndian point types were found in association
with these remains: Folsom and Plainview. Other sites in the region that have yielded remains
of Bison antiques include Arenosa Shelter and Cueva Quebrada (Turpin and Bement 1985:8).
Based on this evidence the Lower Pecos River region has been suggested to have been part of
a larger economic pattern of “big game hunting” that was found across much of the western US
at this time. PaleoIndian projectile points of this phase have also been found at Devil’s Mouth
Cave in a context suggestive of an open camping area (Turpin and Bement 1985:6-8).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The period from about 7800 to 7000 B.C. has been placed in the Oriente phase, also
termed “Pre-Archaic” (Turpin and Bement 1985:8). The type site for this “terminal” PaleoIndian
manifestation is Baker Cave, where Golondrina and Angostura points were found in contexts
that show little difference from those of the subsequent Archaic period (Chadderdon 1983; Word
and Douglas 1970). Apparently, by this time, the broad-spectrum, “Archaic” subsistence pattern
that was to characterize the Lower Pecos region for the next 10,000 years was already in place.
Turpin and Bement (1985:8) note that the onset of the dry, post-Pleistocene climatic conditions
was signaled by the appearance of desert succulents, such as prickly pear, as a dietary
mainstay. Work at Hinds Cave as well as Saunders’s (1986) survey data in the surrounding
region show that canyon, upland, and interior upland environments were all being exploited by
this time period.
3.2.2

Early Archaic Period (ca. 7000 to 4000 B.C.)

Turpin and Bement (1985:8) have defined the Viejo phase for the Early Archaic period in
the Lower Pecos region. This is the period when the full range of Archaic traits appears in the
dry rockshelters in the region. Specifically, they refer to burned rock middens, hearths, slaband grass-lined pits, prickly pear floors, and refuse dumps as being present in several sites,
including Eagle Cave (41VV167) and Hinds Cave (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Parsons 1965;
Shafer and Bryant 1977; Stock 1983). They also note the appearance at this time of basketry,
cordage and sandals, and the first painted pebbles. Characteristic projectile points of the Viejo
phase include Baker, Bandy, Uvalde, Gower, Martindale, and the Early Barbed series (Turpin
and Bement 1985:8).
Coprolite data support an increasing dietary emphasis on vegetation, small animals, and
reptiles, in comparison to the preceding phase. The diet now included agave, sotol, and yucca
plants, as well as selected rodent parts. Saunders’s upland survey data failed to record any
evidence for Early Archaic utilization of these areas, but the remains of upland plants and
animals from Hinds Cave shows that these areas must have been utilized (Saunders 1986:228).
Saunders suggests that the more remote upland areas were not utilized as frequently at this
time as they were in later periods.
3.2.3

Middle Archaic Period (ca. 4000 to 1200 B.C.)

The Middle Archaic period has been divided into 2 periods: the Eagle Nest phase
(4000 to 1900 B.C.) and the San Felipe phase (1900 to 1200 B.C.). The period defined as the
Eagle Nest phase is now placed in the Middle Archaic period on the basis of the occurrence of
Pandale points (Dibble 1967) and of a pattern of increasing regionalization of traits (Turpin
1982:24; Turpin and Bement 1985:9). Coprolite data reveal an increasing reliance on desert
vegetation and fauna (Williams-Dean 1978), while the dry shelter deposits dating to this period
contain the full range of fiber, wood, bone, and flint industries.
The San Felipe phase (1900 to 1200 B.C.) continues this pattern of regionalization and
is characterized by Langtry, Val Verde, Arledge, and Almagre dart points (Turpin and Bement
1985:9). Turpin and Bement (1985:9) feel that the classic Pecos River rock art style should be
placed in this phase. The subsistence economy mirrors that of the preceding Eagle Nest phase,

16

Between Broadway and Garfield Streets, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

although there may have been a shift in some sites toward riverine and upland resources
exploitation.
3.2.4

Late Archaic Period (ca. 1200 B.C. to A.D. 950)

The Late Archaic period has been subdivided into 3 cultural phases by Turpin and
Bement (1985:9-10): the Cibola phase (1200 to 400 B.C.), the Flanders phase (400 B.C. to
A.D. 200), and the Blue Hills phase (A.D. 200 to 950). The Cibola phase appears to have
occupied a short mesic interlude within the overall trend toward increasing aridity in the Lower
Pecos River region. Bison apparently extended their range southward during this phase, and
northern hunters from the Llano Estacado and Central Texas followed them into the area
(Turpin and Bement 1985:9). The bison jump at Bonfire Shelter was utilized again during this
phase, and characteristic projectile point types include Montell, Castroville, and Marshall.
Turpin and Bement (1985:9) have tentatively placed the Red Linear rock art style within this
cultural phase based on the depiction of bison hunting. Interestingly, domestic dogs are also
shown in these paintings at the same time that canid bones reach a peak in Arenosa Shelter
(Turpin and Bement 1985:9). Projectile point types representative of this phase include Montell,
Castroville, and Marshall dart points.
The subsequent Flanders phase saw the resumption of the previous arid trend in the
Lower Pecos River region and the retreat of the bison back to the north. This apparently
encouraged a return to the “desert-adapted” economy of the Middle Archaic. Turpin and
Bement (1985:9-10) suggest that the lack of continuity during the previous phase was the result
of an intrusive culture, and the resurgence of the earlier pattern is the result of renewed visibility
rather than abrupt cultural change. Dar point types characteristic of this phase include Shumla
and Marcos. Turpin and Bement (1985:10) state that “few distinctive or innovative traits beyond
the characteristic projectile point styles can be securely attributed to this phase.”
The final phase of the Late Archaic period is the Blue Hills phase. This phase witnessed
an intensification of the traditional “desert life-style” of the earlier periods. Sharp increases in
percentages of unifaces are interpreted as indicating an increased emphasis on vegetal
processing. The occurrence of silica sheen on some of these tools would tend to support this
view (Turpin and Bement 1985:10). In addition, there is some evidence for a heavier reliance
on riverine resources (especially fish) during this phase, although this may be more a result of
better preservation than of an actual change in emphasis. Ring middens first appear at this time
and have been interpreted as the remains of burned rock ovens used for the preparation of
desert succulents. Projectile point styles characteristic of this period include the Frio and Ensor
types. There is an elaboration of the fiber industry that incorporated patterned and painted
matting and basketry. Such artifacts were often intended as funerary goods. Burials were
usually bundled and placed in rockshelters, bound and wrapped in shrouds of hide and matting.
Finally, stone features that may be the remnants of supports for huts covered with hide and
grass may date to this phase.

3.2.5

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 950 to 1700)

The Late Prehistoric period is divided into the Flecha phase (A.D. 950 to 1500),
belonging to the Late Prehistoric proper, and the protohistoric Infierno phase (A.D. 1500 to
1700). As noted above, the bow and arrow were introduced into the Lower Pecos River region
sometime after A.D. 600, as indicated by the characteristic point types of the Flecha phase—
initially Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points, followed by Livermore and Toyah (Turpin and Bement
1985:10). Rockshelters continued to be occupied during this phase, but there may have been a
preference for upland settlement. Mortuary customs may have shifted to include cairn burial in
the uplands, and circular stone rings can be positively attributed to this phase. Turpin and
Bement (1985:10) feel that the distinctive Red Monochrome pictograph style was introduced
during this phase, or possibly later. Turpin and Bement conclude that “taken in composite, the
attributes of this phase reflect considerable cultural mobility, most probably effected by the
movements of people rather than diffusion” (1985:10).
The Infierno phase has been referred to as protohistoric based on what appears to be a
completely different artifact assemblage in comparison to earlier assemblages characteristic of
the Lower Pecos River region (Turpin and Bement 1985:10). This artifact assemblage includes
small, triangular arrow points, plain brownware ceramics (some with bone temper), steeply
beveled Dorso end scrapers, and prismatic blades. This material is typically found at stone
circle sites and resembles assemblages from the margins of the Southern Plains more than any
preceding indigenous complex. It has been suggested that this phase reflects a period of
cultural unrest and change during the Late Prehistoric and early Historic periods (Turpin and
Bement 1985:10-11). Turpin and Bement feel that some of the late-style monochrome
pictographs may be attributable to the Infierno phase (1985:10).
3.2.6

Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700 to 1850)

The “official” end of the prehistoric period in the Lower Pecos River region can be set at
1590 when the expedition of Gaspar Castaño de Sosa passed through the area on its passage
from Monclova to Pecos (Turpin 1982; Turpin and Bement 1985:11). Serious Anglo-American
penetration of the region began in the mid-1800s, brought about by the need for trade and
military routes (Turpin 1982:29). The area was mapped in 1857 as a result of the Unites StatesMexico Boundary survey. Attempts to control the region culminated with the construction of the
military road from the Devil’s River to the Pecos to the mouth of the Pecos in 1880. This same
route was followed by the Southern Pacific Railroad 2 years later in 1882. As is the case in
many areas of the west, the archeological visibility of historic Native American populations, such
as the Apache and later the Comanche, is extremely low. The presence of such groups may
only be revealed by occasional metal arrow points and in the Historic pictograph style, depicting
missions, domestic livestock, and European or Anglo human figures. Turpin and Bement
(1985:11) suggest that “the paucity of sites of this age can be attributed to the short span of this
phase and to the extremely mobile lifeways of these refugees from colonization.”

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated APE
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Park Service’s (NPS’s) online
National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas State Historical Association’s and the
General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a
program of intensive survey of the project area. No cultural resources were documented as a
result of this survey, so the second and third of these goals were not pursued. The rest of this
chapter presents the methodological background for the current investigations and the specific
survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to conducting the archeological fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing
archival documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations
conducted in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural
resource properties in or near the survey area. Based on this archival research, no previously
recorded archeological sites have been documented on or within a one-block radius of project
area, and no prior cultural resource surveys have been conducted within or in the vicinity of the
APE. Similarly, no listed NRHP historic properties exist on or within a one-block radius of the
project area.

SURVEY METHODS

On July 1, 2008, Horizon’s Reign Clark, project archeologist, under the direction of
Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, conducted an intensive survey of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac)
APE and photo-documented standing structures within a one-half block radius of the vacant lot
to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
construction project. The 0.4-ac (0.9-ac) tract on which proposed construction would occur
consists of a vacant lot paved with mixed asphalt and gravel. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for block-area cultural resource surveys state that
3 shovel tests be excavated within project areas the size of the current project’s APE. The
shovel testing density may be increased in areas with higher probabilities to contain cultural
resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in areas with low probabilities for cultural
resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland settings with minimal soil cover. For the
current project, a minimum of 3 shovel tests would be required in 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) APE. Due to
the extent of existing disturbances on the lot, no shovel tests or other subsurface probes were
excavated during the survey. While the TSMASS were not met, no in situ soils are present on
this lot and it possesses no potential to contain any intact archeological deposits. The
pedestrian survey is therefore considered to constitute an adequate survey technique for
identifying cultural resources within the APE. Figures 3 to 10 present representative images of
the vacant lot and standing structures within one-half city block of the project area that were
photo-documented during the field survey.
The Roswell Hotel is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the
corner of Garfield and Griner streets. Constructed in 1926, the Roswell Hotel, now the Roswell
Apartments, consists of a 6-story brick structure with first-floor commercial storefronts.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Handbook 2008), the Roswell Hotel was used as a
hospital by the controversial medical charlatan, broadcaster, and political candidate Dr. John
Brinkley from 1933 to 1938. Other standing structures within one-half block of the APE include
a 2-story apartment building on the southwest side of Griner Street, a municipal building and a
private residence on the northwest side of Broadway Street, and various other modern
buildings. THC files contained a record of a T-shaped, possibly adobe, structure supposedly
built in 1926 located at 407 Griner Street at the corner of Griner and Broadway streets;
however, the field reconnaissance of the one-half-block area surrounding the APE revealed that
this structure is no longer extant.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same
location in which they were found. As no cultural resources were observed during the survey,
the collections policy was not brought into play.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

FCD is proposing to develop an approximately 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract in downtown Del Rio,
Val Verde, Texas, for the General Services Administration (GSA). The tract consists of a vacant
lot paved in a mix of asphalt and gravel that is bounded by Broadway Street on the northwest
and by Garfield Street on the southeast on the block between Griner Street to the southwest
and South Main Street to the northeast. The proposed project would be sponsored by the GSA,
a federal agency; therefore, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a federally permitted undertaking with
the potential to impact significant cultural resources, FCD was required to provide for a cultural
resources inventory and assessment of the project’s APE and to assess the project’s possible
impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE. The project’s APE consists of the 0.4ha (0.9-ac) vacant lot.
To meet its responsibilities under the NHPA, FCD contracted with Horizon to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract situated between Broadway and Garfield
streets. In addition to the assessment of the lot itself, Horizon’s archeologist photographed all
standing structures within one-half city block of the property to show what viewsheds of historic
buildings, if any, may be impacted by the proposed development of the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological and/or historical sites are
located within the APE, and, if any exist, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
On July 1, 2008, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 0.4-ac
(0.9-ac) vacant lot that comprises the APE and photographed standing structures located within
one-half city block of the property. Jeffrey D. Owens served as the Principal Investigator for the
project and Reign Clark served as Project Archeologist. The cultural resources investigation
consisted of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the defined APE, and photodocumentation of standing structures within one-half city block of the vacant lot. The purpose of
the survey was to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed construction project.
The 0.4-ac (0.9-ac) tract on which proposed construction would occur consists of a
vacant lot paved with mixed asphalt and gravel. No in situ soils are present on this lot and it
possesses no potential to contain any intact archeological deposits. No cultural resources,
historic or prehistoric, were identified on the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) tract as a result of the survey.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

The Roswell Hotel is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the
corner of Garfield and Griner streets. Constructed in 1926, the Roswell Hotel, now the Roswell
Apartments, consists of a 6-story brick structure with first-floor commercial storefronts.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Handbook 2008), the Roswell Hotel was used as a
hospital by the controversial medical charlatan, broadcaster, and political candidate Dr. John
Brinkley from 1933 to 1938. While the Roswell Hotel is not listed on the NRHP, the eligibility of
the Roswell Hotel for inclusion in the NRHP apparently has never been formally assessed.
Other standing structures within one-half block of the APE include a 2-story apartment
building on the southwest side of Griner Street, a municipal building and a private residence on
the northwest side of Broadway Street, and various other modern buildings. THC files
contained a record of a T-shaped, possibly adobe, structure supposedly built in 1926 located at
407 Griner Street at the corner of Griner and Broadway streets; however, the field
reconnaissance of the one-half-block area surrounding the APE revealed that this structure is
no longer extant.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objective is rather to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated
further in pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological
and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the
site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a function of
the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Archeological
resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of
archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP.

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists and the modern
ground surface was thoroughly inspected for cultural resources. No cultural resources, historic
or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of the survey.
The Roswell Hotel is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the
corner of Garfield and Griner streets. Constructed in 1926, the Roswell Hotel, now the Roswell
Apartments, consists of a 6-story brick structure with first-floor commercial storefronts.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Handbook 2008), the Roswell Hotel was used as a
hospital by the controversial medical charlatan, broadcaster, and political candidate Dr. John
Brinkley from 1933 to 1938. While the Roswell Hotel is not listed on the NRHP, the eligibility of
the Roswell Hotel for inclusion in the NRHP apparently has never been formally assessed.
Other standing structures within one-half block of the APE include a 2-story apartment
building on the southwest side of Griner Street, a municipal building and a private residence on
the northwest side of Broadway Street, and various other modern buildings. THC files
contained a record of a T-shaped, possibly adobe, structure supposedly built in 1926 located at
407 Griner Street at the corner of Griner and Broadway streets; however, the field
reconnaissance of the one-half-block area surrounding the APE revealed that this structure is
no longer extant. Aside from the Roswell Hotel, as noted above, all standing structures within
one-half block of the APE are less than 50 years old.

6.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac) APE as a result of survey activities,
and no listed historic properties are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be
adversely affected by the proposed undertaking. As noted above, the Roswell Hotel,
constructed in 1926, is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the APE on the corner of
Garfield and Griner streets. While the Roswell Hotel is not listed on the NRHP, the eligibility of
the Roswell Hotel for inclusion in the NRHP apparently has never been formally assessed.
Nonetheless, as the surrounding neighborhood consists of an urban setting with numerous
multiple-story modern structures, it is Horizon’s opinion that construction on the 0.4-ha (0.9-ac)
lot that comprises the APE would not result in any viewshed impacts to adjacent historic-age
buildings.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the GSA and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
