ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of an archeological survey conducted within the boundaries of the
Sibley Nature Center operated by the City of Midland Department of Parks and Recreation in
Midland County, Texas. The Sibley Nature Center plans to improve the nature trails on its
property by constructing four shaded interpretive stations, a wildlife viewing/feeding station,
habitat and geologic displays, and a teaching gazebo. These improvements are expected to bring
more visitors to Sibley Nature Center grounds, and the anticipated increased foot traffic may
affect the entire property. Consequently, the cultural resources investigations were conducted
over all 50 acres in the Sibley Nature Center’s care. The cultural resources assessments presented
here represent one phase of the efforts of the City of Midland to meet its legal responsibilities for
the identification, evaluation, and treatment of historic properties under its jurisdiction in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The cultural resources work was conducted by
the Cultural Resources Division of Geo-Marine, Inc., Plano, Texas. Fieldwork took place
between December 18 and 20, 2007.
Pedestrian survey covered the entire 50 acres of the Sibley Nature Center. Three areas within the
nature center’s boundaries were also subjected to shovel testing. Through these efforts one
prehistoric lithic scatter was discovered and assigned site number 41MD40. The scatter produced
no diagnostic artifacts and is therefore, considered not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. All artifacts,
notes, forms, and photographs obtained during this project are on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Proposed improvements are planned within of the 50-acre Sibley Nature Center situated in the
northeast corner of the City of Midland, Midland County, Texas (Figure 1). The Sibley Nature
Center property is bounded to the north and east by the Hogan Park Golf Course fence line. An
entrance road trending north into Hogan Park forms the project area’s western boundary. East
Wadley Avenue marks the southern boundary; however, this boundary is interrupted by a fenced,
square, 2-acre plot that houses a radio tower and associated equipment. Sibley Nature Center
plans to improve the nature trails on its property by constructing four shaded interpretive stations,
a wildlife viewing/feeding station, habitat and geologic displays, and a teaching gazebo. These
improvements are expected to bring more visitors to Sibley Nature Center grounds, and the
anticipated increase in foot traffic may affect the entire property.
Because this project is funded by the State of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department under their
Outdoor Recreation Grant Program, the City of Midland is required under the Antiquities Code of
Texas to assess the impact of the development upon the cultural resources of the area. The City
of Midland contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas, to provide the required
cultural resources investigations (GMI project number 30593.00.01). The report presented herein
is in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, as well as Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and Section 191.002 of the Texas Natural
Resources Code. Cultural resources investigations were conducted over all 50 acres in the Sibley
Nature Center’s care and were designed to locate and evaluate all cultural resources within the
project area. Fieldwork was conducted on December 18, 19, and 20, 2007, by Project
Archeologist Mr. Jonathan Meyer and Archeological Technician Mr. Ryan Bennett of GMI. Ms.
Melissa Green of GMI served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The following chapters provide brief reviews of the environmental and cultural backgrounds
(Chapters 2 and 3) and a description of the methodology used during this project (Chapter 4),
followed by the results of the investigations and the recommendations based on those results
(Chapters 5 and 6). A list of references cited in the text concludes the body of the report.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Midland County is located in the middle of the Permian Basin, a Permian-age (c. 290–248 million
years ago) shallow sea that was located between central Texas and New Mexico. This formation
is associated with extensive deposits of petroleum, natural gas, and liquid natural gas. Cretaceous
period sands, clays, and limestones were then deposited above the Permian rocks, forming the
parent material of some of the soils in the county. Still later, sediments derived from the Rocky
Mountains were deposited. The most recent deposits are found in the dune areas near Monahans
and Midland Draw. The Edwards Plateau is found in the southeastern third of Midland County,
and the remainder of the county, including the City of Midland, is on the Llano Estacado. The
Llano Estacado is a very flat, arid plain found in western Texas and eastern New Mexico.
Permanent water sources are few, primarily consisting of playa basins that have been reduced in
size. Two vegetal communities are defined for the Llano Estacado: the Mixed Prairie Climax
community on flat uplands and the High Plains Bluestem Postclimax community on the edges of
escarpments or in areas of deep sandy soil. Trees and large bushes, including wild plum (Prunus
Americana), are found along drainages, on the lower slopes of playas, and on the edges of
escarpments (Hofman 1989a; Hyde et al. 1973:40–41).
Midland is near the boundary between Blair’s (1950) Kansan biotic province and the Balconian
province to the southeast. More specifically, it is part of his Short-grass Plains district that
corresponds to the Llano Estacado. The native vegetation near Midland includes buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), side-oats grama (Bouteloua
curtipendula), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), sand bluestem (Andropogon hallii),
switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and Indian grass (Sorphaatum nutans) with associated forbs and
legumes. Isolated trees, including mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), are found in upland areas and
redberry juniper (Juniperus coahuilensis) in steeper areas. Antelope (Antilocapra americana),
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), badger (Taxidea taxus), coyote (Canis latrans),
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), bobcat (Felis rufus), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and skunk (Mephitis mephitis) are found in the
region; the once plentiful bison (Bison bison) were extirpated during the nineteenth century. The
avian population of the region includes doves (Columba livia), ringneck duck (Aythya collaris),
geese (Branta canadensis), quail (Coturnix spp.), and lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus
pallidicinctus) (Hyde et al. 1973:26).

Midland County has a dry steppe climate, characterized by mild winters and hot summers.
During the winter, frequent cold fronts move in from the north, accompanied by strong, gusty
winds. On average, 22 days during the month of January will have a low temperature of below
32° Fahrenheit (F) and two days with more than 2.5 mm (millimeters; 0.1 inch [in]) of snow.
July is the hottest month, with an average daily high temperature of 94.5 F, although the average
daily low temperature of 69.3 F provides considerable relief. As noted above, the region is arid,
receiving on average only 35.6 centimeters (cm; 14 in) of rainfall per year, compared to a mean
annual lake evaporation rate of 183 to 188 cm (72–74 in) (Orton 1973).
The project area is in a broad expanse of flat upland deposits that has received a considerable
amount of recent human disturbance (Figure 2). At least two oil pipelines cross the area. Three
or more wells have been dug. The Junior Master Gardener compound, with associated structures,
lies in the westcentral portion of the project area. A historic go-kart track circled the area now
partially occupied by a developed pond in the northwest corner of project. Finally, several
walking trails and a few overgrown dirt roads crisscross the project area. Grasses, typically of the
bunch grass variety, are sparse with ground surface visibility varying between 60 and 90 percent.
Other vegetation includes of mesquite (Prosopis spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), and some prickly pear
(Opuntia spp.) and horse crippler (Echinocactus texensis) cacti. Around Sibley Pond (Figure 3),
in the northwest portion of the project area, vegetation is much thicker, resulting in ground
surface visibility of less than 10 percent. Here, vegetation includes species such as cattails
(Typha latifolia), Huisache daisies (Amblyyolepis setigera), cottonwoods (Populus wislizeni), and
coyote willows (Salix exigua).

The property held by the Sibley Nature Center contains soils classified under the AmarilloArvana-Midessa association (Hyde et al. 1973). Amarillo soils dominate the landscape at Sibley.
This series consists of reddish brown fine sandy loams above friable layers of sandy clay loam.
Arvana soils are also found in a few locations within the project area. These soils are very similar
to the Amarillo series, but tend to be a little denser and contain more pores. Lipan clay, a minor
soil of the Amarilla-Arvana-Midessa association, is found in the playa area around Sibley Pond.
This series is defined by a dark gray clay A horizon above a light brownish gray hard clay B
horizon (Hyde et al. 1973).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Archeological research in Midland County has been limited; as of 2007, only 39 sites were
recorded in Midland County at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.
All but three of these recorded sites include a prehistoric component. Two of the prehistoric sites,
41MD19 and 41MD34, lie within a mile of the project area, just east of Hogan Park’s northeast
corner. Artifacts observed at site 41MD19 included dart and arrow points, side scrapers, manos,
end scrapers, and brownware pottery (Riggs 1975). At site 41MD34, nondiagnostic flakes and
cores were identified (Stickney 1987).
In summary tables provided by Treece (1992, 1996), only two projects are listed for Midland
County—the excavations and geological investigations at the Paleo-Indian period Scharbauer site
(Wendorf 1961; Wormington 1964) and a pipeline survey between O.H. Ivie Reservoir and
Midland (Treece et al. 1992). In 1973, Shawn (1973) published the results of the 1972–1973
excavations at the Bull Hill site (41MD2) in southern Midland County, an apparent Protohistoric
period Native American occupation. Smaller cultural resources management projects undertaken
in Midland County include a survey of the Midland North Loop (Denton 1983), a power line
survey (Turpin 1993), and a survey of the Northwest Community Park (Dorward 1995). No
previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project area. Several surveys,
however, have investigated areas just outside of the project area. These include a 1983 Texas
State Department of Highways and Public Transportation survey in the vicinity of 41MD19, a
1982 Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation linear survey north of
Hogan Park, a 1989 State Department of Highways and Public Transportation survey along
LaMesa Road, and a 1994 Corps of Engineers study on the intermittent stream west of the Sibley
Nature Center (Texas Historical Commission 2007). None of these surveys recorded new
archeological sites. Recent large-scale projects in the vicinity of Midland County include O.H.
Ivie (formerly Stacy) Reservoir in Concho, Runnels, and Coleman counties (Bailey et al 1989;
Batterman 1991; Bryan and Collins 1988; Earls et al. 1991, 1993; Lintz et al. 1995; Lintz, Treece,
Oglesby, Kibler, O’Neill, Trierweiler, Holloway, Scott-Cummings, and Scurlock 1993; Lintz,
Trierweiler, Earls, Oglesby, Blum, O’Neill, Kuhl, Holloway, Scott-Cummings, and Scurlock
1993; Quigg et al. 1996; Treece et al. 1993a, 1993b; Wooldridge et al. 1981) and Justiceburg
Reservoir in Garza and Kent counties (Boyd et al. 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994).

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
Two recent reviews on the archeology of the Llano Estacado are by Hofman et al. (1989) and
Johnson and Holliday (1995). The following discussion is largely based on that presented by
Johnson and Holliday. A summary of the chronological periods recognized for the Llano
Estacado is presented in Table 1. Readers interested in a more detailed discussion should consult
either of the above works.

After Hofman 1989 and Johnson and Holliday 1995

The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500 to 6500 B.C.) is the earliest generally recognized human
occupation in North America. The period is typified by the use of lanceolate projectile points and
a population generally characterized as consisting of small groups of highly mobile, big-game
hunters. The Llano Estacado contains several important Paleo-Indian sites such as Blackwater
Draw and Lubbock Lake, and the Scharbauer (Midland Man) site is in proximity to the project
area. The earliest human occupation of the central United States is represented by the Clovis
culture and is usually associated with the remains of extinct Pleistocene mammals. Climatic
conditions during the Clovis period consisted of “an equitable, humid, maritime paleoclimate . . .
with a lower mean annual temperature than today; there were also cooler summers and warmer
winters that lacked extended freezing conditions (Johnson and Holliday 1995:522). During the
succeeding Folsom period, the emphasis shifted from exploitation of Pleistocene megafauna to
bison, part of an environmental shift that included “[a]n accelerated warming trend, greater
seasonality, increased annual temperature fluctuation, and wide-spread extinctions” (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:523). Although both Clovis and Folsom are very widespread cultural phenomena,
regionalization of cultural groups began to appear following the Folsom period. On the Llano
Estacado, this consisted of the Plainview and Firstview cultures. The major distinction of the
Plainview period is the presence of the unfluted Plainview points; climatic conditions, however,
became warmer and drier throughout the period. During the Firstview period, the earlier moist
conditions ended and drier conditions became established (Hofman 1989b; Johnson and Holliday
1995).
The Archaic period is one of increasing regionally circumscribed groups with an increasing
dependence upon vegetal resources indicated by the introduction of gouges, manos, and metates.
The period is one of increasing diversification and specialization of tool kits. The Early Archaic
period on the Llano Estacado is not well known. Environmental conditions continued to
deteriorate to the beginning of the Altithermal period (4000–2500 B.C.), a very hot, dry, and dusty
8

period with extensive aeolian sedimentation. The Middle Archaic period coincides with the
Altithermal. Prehistoric wells have been identified for this period at Blackwater Draw Locality
#1 (Evans 1951; Green 1962), Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991; Meltzer and Collins 1987), and
Mark’s Beach (Honea 1980). The return of cooler and moister conditions than found during the
Altithermal occurred during the Late Archaic period. Stable vegetation appears to have returned
to the area, as aeolian sedimentation ceased and wind erosion was reduced (Boyd et al. 1989:39–
44; Johnson and Holliday 1995).
The Ceramic period is marked by the introduction of two new technologies: pottery and the bowand-arrow. Johnson and Holliday (1995) informally divide the Ceramic period into earlier (50
B.C. to A.D. 950) and later (A.D. 950 to A.D. 1450) periods. The gradual transition from the earlier
Archaic lifeways to those found in the later Ceramic period is indicated by the coexistence of dart
and arrow points at several sites with good stratigraphic context; pottery, arrow points, and dart
points were also found together at Deadman’s Shelter (Hughes and Willey 1978). Diagnostic
artifacts of the period include Scallorn points and coarse-tempered, cord-marked pottery. The
later Ceramic period is characterized by Puebloan trade pottery (especially Jornado Mogollon
types) and Plains-style lithic tool types (Johnson and Holliday 1995:528–530).
Johnson and Holliday (1995:530) anachronistically date their Protohistoric period to ca. A.D.
1450–1650, apparently in order to have this period coincide with the radiometrically derived date
range for Garza points. This usage, however, contradicts their earlier statement that the
“Protohistoric period covers the time when Europeans were in the region, but their influence was
not manifested in the aboriginal material culture nor in the archeological record” (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:521). The Native American portion of the succeeding Historic period is
characterized as being “marked by the appearance of European trade goods and modern horse
remains” (Johnson and Holliday 1995:530). Meanwhile, Hofman’s (1989c) dating of the
Protohistoric period from the beginning of the Coronado expedition in 1541 to ca. 1800 is more
consistent with the usage of the term Protohistoric as used elsewhere in Texas. Hofman’s usage
of Protohistoric is followed here.
At the beginning of the Protohistoric period, the inhabitants of the region were probably the
Jumano, a Tanoan-speaking nation of traders. The Jumano had extensive trading networks across
Texas, with historically documented contacts with the Rio Grande pueblos, the Caddo of
northeastern Texas, and the Wichita (Hickerson 1994:xxvi, 24). The Jumano may already have
been in conflict with the Apache at the time of the Coronado expedition (Hickerson 1994:24);
certainly, they were at war with the Apache later (Hickerson 1994; John 1975). The conflict
between the Jumano and Apache continued until the early eighteenth century, when the Jumano
were destroyed as an independent group. The Apache, however, were unable to retain possession
of the region for a long period, because they were already under pressure from the Comanche to
the north. By the end of the eighteenth century, the southern Llano Estacado was dominated by
the Comanche, who controlled the region until the 1870s.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The earliest Europeans known to have traversed western Texas were Alvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca and his companions Alsono del Castillo, Andrés Dorantes, and Esteban. These individuals
were shipwrecked along the Texas Gulf coast in 1528 and spent the next eight years traveling
among the Native American groups in present-day east, south, and west Texas in an effort to
9

reach the Spanish settlements in New Spain. They finally encountered a Spanish slave-raiding
expedition in northwestern Mexico (Weber 1992:42–45). Given the particulars of Cabeza de
Vaca’s journeys, it is unlikely that he had a significant effect upon Native American culture.
The next expedition to the region was led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. Between 1540
and 1542, the Coronado expedition explored present-day New Mexico, Arizona, the Texas
Panhandle, Oklahoma, and Kansas in search of the fabled seven cities of Cíbolo. Cíbolo turned
out to be distorted reports of the southwestern pueblos, and a disappointed Coronado returned to
New Spain (Weber 1992:45–49). Several other expeditions crossed the Trans-Pecos region
following Coronado (Weber 1992:Map 2). The permanent European presence in western Texas
and New Mexico began in 1598, when Juan de Oñate began his expedition of conquest in the Rio
Grande valley. The conquerors originally lived among the subjugated populations, with the
European settlement of Santa Fe being founded in 1610 (Weber 1992:77–82, Map 2). Although
European influences, especially the introduction of the horse, greatly affected Native American
groups on the southern Llano Estacado, European populations did not begin to replace aboriginal
populations until the 1870s.
Anglo-American settlement of the Midland region began in the mid-nineteenth century, with a
population of approximately 300 in 1880. The town of Midland was established along the Texas
and Pacific Railroad, near the midpoint between El Paso and Fort Worth. Midland County was
organized from Tom Green County in 1885. Ranching was originally the mainstay of the local
economy, with farming becoming important around 1915. Cotton, grain sorghums, and sorgo
were the principal crops, with cotton as the main cash crop. By about 1930, an average ranch
consisted of the ranch house, corrals, fenced pastures surrounding wells and windmills, herds of
several hundred cattle, and several horses. The typical farm contained small houses and
outbuildings, and farm equipment consisted of listers, planters, cultivators, and harrows.
Although a few farmers had purchased tractors by about 1930, most maintained five to eight work
horses or mules; other domestic livestock consisted of one or two cows and hogs and couple of
dozen chickens. Mining for potash was also conducted in Midland County (Templin and Kerr
1928 1 ; Webb et al. 1952:2:187–188).
The discovery of oil in the Permian Basin in 1923 dramatically altered Midland’s fortune.
Midland soon became a logistical base for exploiting Permian Basin oil, resulting in population
growth and a significant increase in wealth (Webb et al. 1952:2:187–188). Midland remained
dependent upon the petroleum industry until the mid-1980s, when collapsing oil prices devastated
domestic petroleum producers. Since the mid-1980s, the Midland economy has diversified, with
the telecommunications industry becoming a force in the area. Nonetheless, petroleum still plays
a major role as evidenced by the region’s recent economic boom due to rising oil prices.

Although soil surveys were dated by the year when fieldwork was completed (Templin and Kerr 1928:fn 1), in this
case (1928), internal evidence within the accompanying text indicate that the soil survey was not published until the
early 1930s.

METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all previous cultural resources investigations in the vicinity
of the project areas. This information was used to determine the locations of all known
archeological sites, standing structures, National Register properties, and National Historic
Landmarks that might be situated near the project areas. The results of the research were used to
guide the field methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be
encountered, and to locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological deposits.
The data also served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could be
evaluated for significance.
The archival research and literature review were conducted by the Project Archeologist. Site
records maintained by TARL, the University of Texas at Austin, were consulted to obtain
information on previous investigations and known sites within or near the current project areas.
Early historic maps and aerial photographs were consulted to form a background for the history
of the area. A map attached to an early Soil Survey of Midland County, Texas (Templin and Kerr
1928), was consulted to determine the locations of potential historic sites. These efforts found no
previously recorded sites within the project area; however, two prehistoric sites (41MD19 and
41MD34) have been recorded within a mile northeast of the project boundary.

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODOLOGY
GMI archeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the Sibley Nature Center project
area. Survey of the project area included walking transects over the entire 50 acres of the nature
center. Transects were spaced 15 meters (m) apart and walked on southwest/northeast lines
parallel to East Wadley Avenue. Transects on the south end of the project area measured
approximately 850 m long and tapered down to approximately 250 m near the project area’s north
end. Twenty-eight transects were used to examine the project area. Although vegetation was
relatively thick throughout the project area, grasses were generally sparse and surface visibility
was good (approximately 80%).
11

A total of 27 shovel tests was selectively dug within the nature center in three specific areas.
Thirteen shovel tests were placed south of Sibley Pond at the north end of the project area (Area
1). Another six shovel tests were dug in the central portion of the project area where Sibley
Nature Center personnel had reported finding burned rock (Area 2). Eight more units were
placed near a well on the eastern edge of the project area (Area 3). Each shovel test was dug into
the hard clay loam or clay subsoil between 30 and 80 cm below surface. The shovel test units
were hand-excavated with shovels and the fill was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware
cloth. A shovel test survey form was used to record soil matrix descriptions and artifact findings
for each excavated unit. All shovel test units were backfilled after the final recording process was
complete.
The Project Archeologist maintained daily field notes that detailed the investigations and field
observations. Each crewmember was responsible for recording the results of each shovel test
excavated by that individual. Shovel test locations were recorded using a Garmin eTrexVistaTM
global positioning system (GPS) unit. These points were converted into shapefiles using
DNRGarmin software made available by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Digital maps plotting the survey areas and shovel tests were created using ESRI ArcMap 9.1.
Digital photographs were taken to record the general topography of these areas as well as the
activities related to the cultural resources investigations. The Project Archeologist maintained a
log of all photographs taken during the project.
A site was defined when materials were recovered from two or more shovel tests or, for surficial
materials, when five or more prehistoric artifacts were found in a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Sites
meeting these criteria were recorded on Texas Archeological Site Data Forms and submitted to
TARL.
All artifacts, notes, forms, and photographs obtained during this project are on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas in Austin.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The Sibley Nature Center property is bounded to the north and east by the Hogan Park Golf
Course fence line, an entrance road into Hogan Park forms the western boundary, and East
Wadley Avenue marks the southern boundary. The shovel testing was concentrated in three areas
(Figure 4). Area 1 focused on the terrain south of Sibley Pond. Area 2 examined a location
approximately 150 m southeast of Sibley Pond, just east of the Nature Trail. Area 3 was
approximately 275 m southeast of Area 2. Area 3 lies on the eastern border of the Sibley Nature
Center near the point where a dirt road traveling from the radio tower compound crosses into
Hogan Park Golf Course. All shovel tests were selectively placed in locations believed to have
the best potential for producing subsurface artifacts.

RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
The pedestrian survey of the nature center project area using transects identified no cultural
resources.

Survey Area 1
The vegetation south of Sibley Pond consists of dense grasses that had been recently mowed at
the time of survey (Figure 5). Thirteen shovel tests were excavated in this area (Figure 6). The
first of these were placed in the northwest corner of the clearing, spaced approximately 20 m
apart from north to south. Subsequent shovel tests were dug along parallel lines heading
southeast toward the southern edge of the clearing then returning northeast to the southeast edge
of the pond.
Sediments in these shovel tests generally followed the Lipan series description (Hyde et al. 1973).
A dark gray (10YR 4/1) A horizon persisted through the first 20 to 30 cm below surface (bs)
before giving way to a very hard dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) B horizon. In shovel tests closer
to the pond with moister sediments, the A horizon continued to a greater depth than drier shovel
tests located farther from the pond.

In an area approximately 30 m south of the east end of Sibley Pond, and 2 m south of a walking
trail that encircles Sibley Pond, lies an accumulation of limestone gravels (Figure 7). These
gravels were missed during the examination of the survey area along transects, but more intense
examination of the area south of Sibley Pond during the shovel testing allowed surveyors to
recognize this site. Scattered within these gravels were several chert flakes and other pieces of
chert debitage (Figure 8). Shovel Test 10 was dug in the center of this gravel and chert scatter,
and the trinomial 41MD40 assigned. Five chert pieces were found on the surface of Shovel Test
10 and another 21 pieces were discovered in the upper 10 cm excavated (Table 2). At least two
of the flakes appear to have modified edges, and 19 of the 25 pieces have cortex present. Most of
the raw material used appears to be an Edwards chert variety, although at least one specimen is a
“banded chert.” The upper sediments in this shovel test differed from the others in Survey Area
1. The upper 5 cm (0–5 cm bs) consisted of a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam. The
next 5 cm (5–10 cm bs) contained a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand that was not found
elsewhere. Below this appeared the dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay B Horizon encountered
elsewhere near the pond. Charcoal and other datable material were absent from this shovel test.
Shovel tests were also excavated in each of the cardinal directions 5 m from Shovel Test 10. No
artifacts were found in any of these shovel tests.
The formation processes of this site are difficult to discern due to several recent construction
activities in the immediate area. In 1980, the original playa was bulldozed to create the current
plastic-lined pond. A water line was also installed in order to pump 15,000 gallons of water daily
into the pond. Several years prior to the construction of this pond, a go-kart track circled the
playa area. North of the pond lies a public golf course. Consequently, the exact location of the
site in relation to the original playa could not be determined. In addition, the limestone gravels

and sand associated with this lithic scatter were not found in the shovel tests dug 5 m from the
center of the scatter, nor were they seen anywhere else on the Sibley Nature Center grounds.
However, it is difficult to make conclusions regarding this information since construction
activities could have moved or destroyed portions of the site.

Survey Area 2
Survey Area 2 included a sparsely vegetated eroding slope just east of the Sibley Nature Trail in
the northeast portion of the project area. Burnt rock had been reported in this area. Surface
inspection of Survey Area 2 found no cultural materials; however, it was evident that recent rains
had caused a significant amount of erosion (e.g., a buried pipe is now visible on the trail).
Therefore, six shovel tests were dug at this location.
Sediments from these shovel tests followed the Amarillo series. The first 30 to 40 cm bs
contained a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam with weak fine granular structure.
Below this was a lighter-colored, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very hard sandy clay loam B
horizon. No cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests in Survey Area 2.

Survey Area 3
Shovel tests in Survey Area 3 were dug in the vicinity of a well installed by the Layne Texas
Company (Figure 9). The well may be close to 50 years old, but it is unlikely to hold any
historical significance because it is in disrepair. Therefore, it is not eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Eight shovel tests were excavated in this area. As in Survey Area 2, the soils in the shovel tests
here also followed the Amarillo series description. A yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy
loam A Horizon was found through the first 40 to 50 cm bs. Below this horizon again sat a
lighter-colored, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam. Unlike Survey Area 2, the B
horizon in a few shovel tests in Survey Area 3 had deposits of calcium carbonate. No cultural
materials were recovered.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP evaluations.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to determine
eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39
CFR Part 60].

21

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination of
whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or
more of the above-defined criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources
properties could yield further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research
questions. Therefore, adequate information on site function, context, and chronological
placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal
period, determination of site context and chronological placement of the cultural properties is a
particularly important objective during the inventory process.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Within the 50 acres of the proposed Sibley Nature Center project area, one prehistoric lithic
scatter was identified and was assigned trinomial 41MD40. The scatter was found entirely within
a 4-m radius, approximately 30 m south of the east end of Sibley Pond. The site has a vertical
depth of 10 cm. Twenty-six lithic artifacts were recovered from a shovel test in the center of the
site, and many more pieces of debitage were seen on the surface within the accompanying gravel
accumulation. However, no diagnostic artifacts or datable materials were discovered. Although
some of the materials certainly date to more than 50 years old, they cannot currently be placed in
any cultural context other than “prehistoric.” Consequently, site 41MD40 does not provide
substantial information on previous social practices in the area. In addition, the identity of the
individuals associated with these materials is not known. These materials also have no known
association to particularly important historical events. Finally, the data potential of site 41MD40
is limited and unlikely to yield significant information regarding the prehistory of the area.
Considering the high amount of disturbance to the area, the site’s integrity must be questioned as
well. As a result, 41MD40 does not satisfy any of the eligibility requirements for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a Texas State Archeological Landmark.
Therefore, damage to site 41MD40 would not be considered an “adverse effect” under the
regulations that implement the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800) and the 1969
Antiquities Code of Texas. The artifacts associated with this site have been recorded using notes,
photographs, and a GPS unit, thus addressing the site’s information potential.
