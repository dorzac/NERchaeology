A Cultural Resources Survey of the Valley Spring
Cellular Tower Site, Llano County, Texas

Abstract
Medina Consulting, Inc., San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower
in a rural area northwest of the city of Llano in northwestern Llano County, Texas. The Federal
Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1)
requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was
provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on July 2, 2011 A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Medina Consulting, Inc. be allowed
to oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.

Introduction
Medina Consulting, Inc. is the
consulting firm employed to
acquire clearance for the
erection of a the Valley Spring
Celluar Tower to be constructed
in northwestern Llano County,
Texas (Figures 1-4). Medina
contracted with Terras Antiguas
to conduct an archaeological
investigation of the proposed
tower site. Although no public
funding was involved in the
proposed development of the
p r o p e r t y, t h e F e d e r a l
Communications Commission’s
Nationwide Programmatic
Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) Figure 1. Location of the project area and Llano County.
requires that a cultural resources
survey be conducted prior to
such an undertaking.
In late June 2011, Tierras
Antiguas conducted an on-line
review of the Archeological Site
Atlas (Atlas) of the Texas State
Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO). The purpose of this
review was to identify any listed
or potential archaeological
resources within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE) .

current on-site photographs, a
detailed architectural engineer’s drawing, a geological map, and a Llano County soils publication
with maps of the proposed project location. The proposed cell tower site is located in a rural area
of Llano County that has apparently been used primarily for agriculture, and has otherwise been
relatively undisturbed.

A review of the Atlas indicated
that the tower site has not been
subjected to a cultural resources
survey, nor had there been a
cultural resources survey
conducted within one mile of
the tower site. However,
because the proposed tower site
is located near the confluence of
Willow Creek and one of its
first order tributaries, this
increased the probability that
buried and intact cultural
material were likely to exist. In
addition, the soil within the
proposed cellular tower
footprint is Castell sandy loam Figure 3. Project location northwest of Llano.
(CeC) (Figure 5). This soil type
is generally neither heavily
eroded or deflated, and further
corroborated the possibility of
encapsulating buried and intact
cultural material.
In sum, the tower site is situated
in a terrain setting that on the
Edwards Plateau region of
Central Texas is demonstrably
rich in archaeological sites, and
it was therefore recommended
that an archaeological survey of
the proposed tower footprint be
conducted before construction Figure 4. Project on Valley Spring (1979) 7.5' USGS

topographic map.
On July 2, 2011, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of the
footprint of the proposed impact area. In addition to the surface survey, Tierras Antiguas
excavated six shovel tests. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and the Texas State
Historical Preservation Office (SHPO). Although no Texas Antiquities Permit was required, this
report of findings was reviewed by the (SHPO).

Project Goals and
Methods
Goals
The project goals
f o c u s e d
o n
archaeological issues
that could be addressed
by the types of data
obtained through
pedestrian survey, along
with limited shovel
testing. The topics
addressed were site type,
distribution, density,
size, depth, and
s t r a t i g r a p h y. T h e
theoretical framework
was structured around
patterns of settlement,
mobility, subsistence,
and social systems for
the Central Texas region.

Cell Tower (Websoil 2011. Llano County, Texas.

[Accessed June 21, 2011] ).

The goals of the project were to
(1) locate and record any
cultural artifacts in the project
area using a systematic survey
methodology, (2) quantify site
size, as well as depth, and
stratigraphy, and (3) place any
diagnostic artifacts within the
regional time frame.

Methods
Prior to the archaeological
survey, the area to be impacted
had been clearly delineated with
survey stakes (Figure 6). In
Accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) Figure 6. The cell tower footprint was clearly delineated with
and C ouncil of Texas stakes (facing east).

Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of
the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the shovel tests were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan, all redundant artifacts
recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm
of the backfilled shovel test.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the tower footprint area was relatively undisturbed, except for shallow
rodent burrows and an apparent wild hog rut, revealing rounded quartzite gravels to golf ball size
on a surface that otherwise offered approximately 80 to 100-percent visibility. Six shovel tests
placed within the tower’s footprint revealed shallow reddish brown sandy clay loam soils over
extremely compacted and cemented hardpan clay ranging in depths from 8 to 15 centimeters
below the surface. The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are
on file at Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No
cultural material was observed either on the surface or in any of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the
project area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither
prehistoric nor historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should
proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having
“no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project
should proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the
vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified
archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
