MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 23 June 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted cultural
resources investigations within the area of potential effect (APE) of the proposed Rocky Creek
Ranch wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) project in western Travis County, Texas. The
cultural resources investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey of the
approximately 12.0-acre WWTP location and a general reconnaissance survey of the
approximately 50.0 acres containing the associated irrigation fields. Overall, the APE totals
approximately 62.0 acres. Because the various project features will eventually be owned and
maintained by Travis County Municipal Utility District No. 16 (TCMUD16), the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Legacy Texas
Bank (LTB) and Jones & Carter, Inc. (JCI), Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations on behalf of TCMUD16. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 5682 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the APE and, if any existed, to
determine their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources investigations within the APE resulted in the documentation of 3
newly recorded archeological sites. Two of the 3 new sites (41TV2376 and 41TV2378) were
documented as prehistoric lithic scatters confined solely to surface contexts on upland slopes
above a tributary of Rocky Creek. Based on the lack of observed fire-cracked rock or formal
tools, both of these sites appear to be lithic procurement sites. Both sites lack temporally
diagnostic artifacts and the potential for buried, stratified deposits. As such, it is Horizon’s
opinion that both are ineligible for formal designation as SALs.
The third site (41TV2377) was documented as a 20th century cattle processing site
consisting of a corral area evidenced by upright cedar posts, a circular water tank/cistern, a
rectangular watering trough, and a concrete capped well head where a windmill once stood.
The exact temporal period of use of these features is undetermined, although the overall lack of
deterioration of the cedar posts and the presence of threaded metal pipes would suggest a
probable mid-20th century utilization. Based on the lack of distinctive architecture and buried
cultural deposits at this site, as well as the general commonness of this type of ranching feature
across the Texas Hill Country, it is Horizon’s opinion that this site is also ineligible for formal
designation as a SAL.

Management Summary

Because sites 41TV2376, 41TV2377, and 41TV2378 are considered to be ineligible for
formal designation as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed undertaking will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of cultural resources investigations conducted within
the area of potential effect (APE) of the proposed Rocky Creek Ranch wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP) project in western Travis County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The cultural
resources investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey of the approximately 12.0acre WWTP site and a general reconnaissance survey of the approximately 50.0 acres
containing the associated irrigation fields. Overall, the APE totals approximately 62.0 acres.
Because the various project features will eventually be owned and maintained by Travis County
Municipal Utility District No. 16 (TCMUD16), the undertaking falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Legacy Texas Bank (LTB) and Jones &
Carter, Inc. (JCI), Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations on behalf of
TCMUD16. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit
number 5682 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the APE and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility
for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
Prior consultation between JCI and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) resulted in a
request from the THC for an intensive pedestrian survey of the 12.0-acre WWTP location and a
general reconnaissance survey of the 50.0 acres containing the irrigation field locations. As
such, the cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the 12.0-acre WWTP site, a general reconnaissance survey associated
irrigation fields, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director)
served as the project’s Principal Investigator and conducted the field investigations on 23 June
2010.
The original Scope of Work for the cultural resources survey of the 12.0-acre WWTP
APE included both intensive surface inspection and shovel testing efforts. However, the entire
APE consisted of shallow, rocky clay soils with exposed subsurface limestone and marl that
precluded the need for shovel testing efforts. As such, only intensive surface inspection was
conducted within the APE of the 12.0-acre WWTP.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The general reconnaissance level survey over the approximately 50.0 acres containing
the irrigation fields consisted of only intensive surface inspection to determine the potential for
undocumented cultural resources within these areas. Like the 12.0-acre WWTP APE, this area
was also found to consist solely of upland settings with only shallow clay soils and exposed
limestone bedrock.
The cultural resources investigations within the APE resulted in the documentation of 3
newly recorded archeological sites. Two of the 3 new sites (41TV2376 and 41TV2378) were
documented as prehistoric lithic scatters confined solely to surface contexts on upland slopes
above a tributary of Rocky Creek. Based on the lack of observed fire-cracked rock or formal
tools, both of these sites appear to be lithic procurement sites. Both sites lack temporally
diagnostic artifacts and the potential for buried, stratified deposits. As such, it is Horizon’s
opinion that both are ineligible for formal designation as SALs.
The third site (41TV2377) was documented as a 20th century cattle processing site
consisting of a corral area evidenced by upright cedar posts, a circular water tank/cistern, a
rectangular watering trough, and a concrete capped well head where a windmill once stood.
The exact temporal period of use of these features is undetermined, although the overall lack of
deterioration of the cedar posts and the presence of threaded metal pipes would suggest a
probable mid-20th century utilization. Based on the lack of distinctive architecture and buried
cultural deposits at this site, as well as the general commonness of this type of ranching feature
across the Texas Hill Country, it is Horizon’s opinion that this site is also ineligible for formal
designation as a SAL.
Because sites 41TV2376, 41TV2377, and 41TV2378 are considered to be ineligible for
formal designation as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed undertaking will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The APE of the proposed Rocky Creek Ranch WWTP project consists of an
approximately 12.0-acre new WWTP site and approximately 50.0 acres that will contain the
associated irrigation fields. The APE is located west of Crumley Ranch Road, just south of its
intersection with Hamilton Pool Road. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute Shingle Hills, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). Construction within the
12.0-acre WWTP will consist of a 0.06275-million-gallon-per-day WWTP and an effluent storage
pond. The average depth of impacts within the WWTP site will be between 3.0 and 8.0 feet (0.9
and 2.4 meters [m]) with a maximum depth of 22.0 feet (6.7 m). Impacts within the
approximately 50.0 acres containing the associated irrigation field will consist only of shallow
impacts to install the spray irrigation system. On-site photographs are provided in Figures 3
through 6.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

The APE is currently utilized for cattle ranching. The vast majority of the APE is open
cattle range, but it also contains several stock tanks, a small cattle processing corral, and a
larger fenced field for holding livestock. The fenced field has been cleared and terraced at
some time in the past to allow for a grazing pasture.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed ROW is situated in an undulating setting typical of the Texas Hill Country.
Surface elevation ranges from approximately 1000 to 1180 feet above mean sea level (USGS,
1986). The APE straddles a tributary of Rocky Creek (see Figure 4) that drains the APE to the
southeast and joins the main channel of Rocky Creek just southeast of the APE. Rocky Creek
confluences with Barton Creek several miles east of the APE, and Barton Creek eventually
empties into the Colorado River in South Austin.

2.4

VEGETATION

Vegetation along the proposed ROW is typical of that of the Texas Hill Country,
consisting of scattered live oaks, Ashe juniper, yaupon, agarita, prickly pear, and short grasses
upon rocky upland surfaces (see Figures 3 through 6).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1400 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.
3.2.1

Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (5000 to 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

10

100081 - arch survey report

Cultural Resources Investigations Conducted for the Proposed Rocky Creek WWTP Project in Travis
County, Texas

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3000 to 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 and dated between
2800 to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock
middens on the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in
any other period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a
result of the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes

HJN 100081 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

such as sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens)
in order to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely
resulted in the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of
buffalo. Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an
increase in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) indicated the presence of 2 previously recorded archeological sites within a 0.6-mile (1.0kilometer [km]) perimeter of the APE (THC 2010). These sites and their distances from the
proposed APE are summarized in Table 2 below. No previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries, including any listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or formally
designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the APE. Based on the
Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the boundaries of the
APE.

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial terraces
near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the fact that the proposed APE straddles a
tributary of Rocky Creek, in conjunction with the presence of previously recorded sites in the
general vicinity, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there was a moderate to high probability
for prehistoric cultural resources being present within the APE.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

Prior consultation between JCI and the THC resulted in a request from the THC for an
intensive pedestrian survey of the 12.0-acre WWTP location and a general reconnaissance
survey of the 50.0 acres containing the irrigation field locations. In compliance with these
requests, a Horizon archeologist completed the cultural resources investigations within the APE
on 22 June 2010. The original Scope of Work for the cultural resources survey of the 12.0-acre
WWTP APE included both intensive surface inspection and shovel testing efforts. However, the
entire APE consisted of shallow, rocky clay soils with exposed subsurface limestone and marl
that precluded the need for shovel testing efforts. As such, only intensive surface inspection
was conducted within the APE of the 12.0-acre WWTP.
The general reconnaissance level survey over the approximately 50.0 acres containing
the irrigation fields consisted of only intensive surface inspection to determine the potential for
undocumented cultural resources within these areas. Like the 12.0-acre WWTP APE, this area
was also found to consist solely of upland settings with only shallow clay soils and exposed
limestone bedrock.
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or
within shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were
maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if
any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were to be completed for every shovel test, to include
location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs
with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. A handheld GPS unit utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum was used to record pertinent location data.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The cultural resources investigations within the APE resulted in the documentation of 3
newly recorded archeological sites (Figure 7). Two of the 3 new sites (41TV2376 and
41TV2378) were documented as prehistoric lithic scatters, while the third site (41TV2377) was
documented as a 20th century cattle processing site. Each of these sites is described
separately below.
6.1.1

Site 41TV2376

General Description
Site 41TV2376 was documented as a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the southern
flank of a hillside in the eastern portion of the APE (Figure 7). The site consists of sparse
amounts of chert flaking debris scattered over the rocky clay and exposed marl surface of the
hillside. The lack of observed fire-cracked rock and formal tools suggests that this site may
represent a small lithic procurement area where aboriginal people collected and reduced raw
lithic materials for transport back to a formal campsite. This site lacks the potential for buried
cultural deposits and all materials are confined solely to surface contexts.
Observed Cultural Materials
The observed cultural material on site 41TV2376 consists only of sparse amounts of
chert flaking debris. Random transects walked over the site produced approximately 15 tertiary
flakes (Figure 8). No formal stone tools or temporally diagnostic materials were observed on
this site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features or evidence of fire-cracked rock was observed on this site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
The horizontal extent of site 41TV2376 appears to measure approximately 15.0 m (49.2
feet) north/south by 40.0 m (131.2 feet) east/west based on the extent of the observed lithic
scatter. Vertically, the site is confined solely to surface contexts by the shallow, rocky clay soils
and exposed marl across the site (Figure 9).

Summary
Site 41TV2376 consists of a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter that appears to represent a
small lithic procurement area based on the lack of observed fire-cracked rock or formal tools.
This site lacks temporally diagnostic artifacts and the potential for buried, stratified deposits. As
such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2376 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL and
that no further documentation is warranted.

6.1.2

Site 41TV2377

General Description
Site 41TV2377 was documented as a 20th century cattle processing site consisting of a
corral area evidenced by upright cedar posts, a circular water tank/cistern, a rectangular
watering trough, and a concrete capped well head where a windmill once stood (Figure 10; see
also Figure 7). This cattle processing site is located just north of a cleared and terraced pasture
that has been fenced to hold cattle prior to processing. The exact temporal period of use of the
features on the site is undetermined, although the overall lack of deterioration of the cedar posts
and the presence of threaded metal pipes would suggest a probable mid-20th century utilization.
Observed Cultural Materials
Site 41TV2377 was found to be essentially devoid of any cultural materials other than
modern trash and the materials comprising the cultural features (described below). No historicera materials were observed on the shallow rocky clay and exposed marl surface of the site.
Cultural Features
The first cultural feature on this site consists of a cattle chute and corral fashioned from
upright cedar posts (Figures 11 and 12; see also Figure 10). No fencing materials were present
between the cedar posts.
The second feature documented on this site is a square, concrete cap that appears to be
covering a well head (Figure 13; see also Figure 10). A windmill symbol at this location on the
topographic quadrangle indicates that this well was once pumped via a windmill that has since
been removed from the site. No dates were found inscribed on the concrete cap that would
allow for dating the site.
The third cultural feature on this site is a large, circular water tank or aboveground
cistern made from limestone blocks and cement (Figure 14; see also Figure 10). This feature
measures approximately 6.0 m (19.7 feet) in diameter and 1.5 m (4.9 feet) tall. A threaded
metal pipe potentially used to transfer water to the tank from the well or to transfer water to a
nearby trough is present on the southern wall of the tank (Figure 15). Currently, the water tank
has been used to dispose of modern refuse such as beer cans, barbed wire, and domestic trash
(Figure 16). Again, no dates were found inscribed within the concrete used to construct the
water tank.

The final cultural feature on this site is a rectangular water trough used for watering
cattle (Figure 17; see also Figure 10). This feature measures approximately 3.0 m (9.8 feet) in
length and 1.0 m (3.3 feet) wide. Like the nearby circular water tank, the trough is also
constructed of limestone blocks and concrete. No dates were found inscribed within the
concrete used to construct the water trough.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
The horizontal extent of site 41TV2377 appears to measure approximately 30.0 m (98.4
feet) northwest/southeast by 20.0 m (65.6 feet) northeast/southwest based on the extent of the
observed cultural features. Vertically, the site is confined solely to surface contexts by the
shallow, rocky clay soils and exposed marl across the site.
Summary
Site 41TV2377 was documented as a cattle processing site that appears to date no
earlier than the 20th century based on the overall lack of deterioration and the observed
construction materials. The site was clearly used to process cattle based on the presence of a
loading chute, corral, and watering trough. The presence of a capped well head and a large
water tank/cistern also mark the spot where a windmill once pumped water to this location. This
type of site is common to any ranching complex across the Texas Hill Country and to essentially
any cattle ranching operation worldwide. Based on the lack of distinctive architecture and
buried cultural deposits at this site, as well as the general commonness of this type of ranching
feature, it is Horizon’s opinion that this site is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL.
6.1.3

Site 41TV2378

General Description
Site 41TV2378 was documented as another prehistoric lithic scatter located on the
southern flank of a hillside in the central portion of the APE (Figure 18; see also Figure 7). This
site also consists of relatively sparse amounts of chert flaking debris and chert cores scattered
over the rocky clay and exposed marl surface of the hillside. With the exception of 1 medial
biface fragment that may represent a dart point fragment, the lack of observed fire-cracked rock
and formal tools suggests that this site may also represent a small lithic procurement area
where aboriginal people collected and reduced raw lithic materials for transport back to a formal
campsite. This site lacks the potential for buried cultural deposits and all materials are confined
solely to surface contexts.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural material on site 41TV2376 consists only of lithic material scattered
over the surface of the site (Figures 19 and 20). The presence of several chert cores in
conjunction with chert flaking debris lends evidence to the use of the site as a lithic procurement
area. In all, approximately 20 tertiary flakes and 3 chert cores were observed on the site’s
surface.

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

In addition to the chert debitage and cores observed on site 41TV2378, 2 flaked stone
implements were also observed. The first specimen consists of the medial section of a biface
that would appear to be a dart point fragment (see Figure 20). This would suggest a utilization
of the site during the general Archaic period. The second specimen consists of a crudely flaked
biface that may be an abandoned quarry blank (see Figure 20). Aside from these 2 specimens,
no other formal stone tools or temporally diagnostic materials were observed on this site.
Cultural Features
No cultural features or evidence of fire-cracked rock were observed on this site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
The horizontal extent of site 41TV2378 appears to measure approximately 20.0 m (65.6
feet) north/south by 20.0 m (65.6 feet) east/west based on the extent of the observed lithic
scatter. Vertically, the site is confined solely to surface contexts by the shallow, rocky clay soils
and exposed marl across the site.
Summary
Site 41TV2378 consists of a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter that appears to represent a
small lithic procurement area based on the lack of observed fire-cracked rock or cultural
features. The presence of a possible dart point fragment suggests a utilization of the site at
least during the general Archaic period. Aside from the 1 possible dart point fragment, this site
lacks both temporally diagnostic artifacts and the potential for buried, stratified deposits. As
such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2378 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL and
that no further documentation is warranted.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources assessments conducted within the APE of the proposed Rocky
Creek Ranch WWTP resulted in the documentation of 3 new archeological sites (41TV2376,
41TV2377, and 41TV2378). Aside from these 3 sites, no other cultural resources were
observed within the APE, and the presence of shallow rocky clay soils and exposed limestone
bedrock and marl throughout the APE indicates an extremely low potential for any
undocumented, buried cultural deposits. Because sites 41TV2376, 41TV2377, and 41TV2378
are all considered to be ineligible for formal designation as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed undertaking will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the undertaking.
