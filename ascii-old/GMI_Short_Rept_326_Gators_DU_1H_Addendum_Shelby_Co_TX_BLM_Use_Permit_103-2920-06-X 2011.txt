MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report is an addendum to the original cultural resources survey report for the proposed
Gators DU #1H project area and presents the results of a damage assessment conducted by GeoMarine, Inc., under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc.
This damage assessment was conducted at the request of the Bureau of Land Management to
examine the adverse effects of construction that has taken place within the project area on cultural
resources prior to permitting by that agency. Fieldwork for this damage assessment was
conducted from 1–2 December 2010 by Geo-Marine Principal Investigator Melissa Green and
Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster. A total of 35.4 acres was assessed, encompassing
a 4.4-acre fracture pond and its associated 2,690-linear-foot-long lease road that was not
previously surveyed as part of the Gators DU #1H project area. Although isolated prehistoric
artifacts were encountered, no significant cultural resources exist within the project area. Based
on the results of this damage assessment, there is a very low potential for deposits containing
significant archeological materials within the project area and it is unlikely that the construction
of the fracture pond and its associated lease road disturbed or destroyed significant cultural
deposits.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents results of a damage assessment conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine
Project No. 30563.02.10), under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO
Energy, Inc., at the request of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This report serves as an
addendum to the previous cultural resources survey report (Goodmaster 2010) submitted for the
proposed Gators DU #1H project area (BLM Lease No. TX NM 108073). As outlined in the
original report, the existing and proposed infrastructure is situated on private property owned by
James Lynn Busbee of Lufkin, Texas. The mineral rights, however, are the possession of the
BLM, and this project is therefore under the oversight of that agency. This work was conducted
under BLM Cultural Use Permit No. 103-2920-06-X for review by the BLM Field Office in
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The Gators DU #1H project area was previously considered to consist of a 7.46-acre well pad to
be shared with the Bearcats DU #1H well and two associated lease road right-of-way (ROW)
alternatives (Figure 1). Lease Road Alternative #1 consisted of a 2,866-linear-foot (ft) ROW
extending east-to-west along the southern property boundary and turning north at the southwest
property corner. A cultural resources survey of the proposed well pad area and Lease Road
Alternative #1 was conducted on 15 January 2010. No archeological sites were encountered
during this survey; however, one isolated surface artifact, a Late Prehistoric arrow point fragment,
was observed. The proposed lease road design was later modified in favor of a 2,612-linear-ft
ROW (Lease Road Alternative #2; see Figure 1) sited to avoid adverse impacts to National Forest
property to the south and possible wetland areas in the southwest corner of the property. In
addition, an unrelated pipeline had been constructed adjacent to the proposed lease road
alternatives, and earth-moving activities had been initiated at the proposed well pad location. An
additional pipeline, lease road, and fracture pond were also under construction immediately to the
north of the well pad (Figure 2). A supplemental cultural resources survey of Lease Road
Alternative #2 was conducted on 7 May 2010. No cultural resources were encountered during
that survey. Based on a review by the BLM, it was determined that unauthorized construction
had taken place and the original project area was inadequately defined. The BLM requested that
a cultural resources damage assessment be conducted of the area adversely affected by the 4.4­
acre fracture pond (Figure 3) and its associated 2,690-linear-ft-long lease road (Figure 4) to
determine if cultural resources had been disturbed by the construction activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area is located within the gently rolling Tertiary uplands of the South
Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943), which supports a variety of flora and fauna. The project area
occupies an elevation range of 95–110 meters (m; 312–360 feet [ft]) above mean sea level (amsl)
with slopes of 0–5 percent (Figure 5). The soils of the region are primarily fine and very fine
sandy loams derived from in situ weathering of the underlying clastic and carbonate bedrock of
the Eocene-age Wilcox Formation. The project area is situated across the Owentown, Maben,
Metcalf, Latex, and Meth soil series and the Metcalf-Sawtown soil complex (Table 1; see Figure
5). Information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from
data supplied by the Soil Conservation Service (Griffith 2006) and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (2010). Morrison Creek and an unnamed tributary of Bell Creek bisect the

CULTURAL HISTORY
The prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas has been previously synthesized by
Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985, 1990), and Thurmond (1985,
1988, 1990). A generalized prehistoric cultural sequence for the Northeast Texas culture area is
outlined in Table 2. For more extensive treatments of the historic period in Northeastern Texas,
see Peter and Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J). For more detailed
information regarding of the prehistory and history of the project area, see the summary presented
in the previous survey report (Goodmaster 2010:10–26).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to fieldwork, review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission indicated that two cultural resources surveys have been conducted within
1 km (0.6 mi) of the proposed project area. A survey was conducted in 1982 by the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service within the Sabine National Forest 0.6 km
(0.4 mi) south of the proposed project area. No cultural resources were recorded during this
survey, but further details are not available. In January and May 2010, the Gators DU #1H well
pad and two lease road alternatives were surveyed (Goodmaster 2010). Although one isolated
7

surface artifact was encountered, no significant archeological deposits were encountered. One
cultural resource, the historic period McWilliams Cemetery, is located to the east, on the opposite
side of State Highway (SH) 147, and will not be adversely affected by the proposed project. No
additional cultural resources have been documented within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the proposed project
area.

METHODS
ARCHIVAL METHODS
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These
materials include historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record
cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography.
Archival research focused on the historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the
project area. The 1863 von Rosenberg map of the Sabine River valley indicates that several
family farms and small communities existed across the region at that time. The proposed Gators
DU #1H project area is located to the southwest of the former McWilliams farm along the San
Augustine Road, present-day SH 147. By the mid-twentieth century, dispersed rural communities
had been established across the region but none was documented historically within the proposed
project area.
Based on a review of these historic records and previously recorded archeological site locations,
it is evident that the area has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more
recent records, however, indicates that the substantial development has occurred in recent years,
altering much of the historic landscape. Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of
previously recorded cultural resources in the region with geomorphic features such as landforms
and soils suggests that prehistoric occupation of the area was typically confined to stream valleys.
Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century, but
settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century.

SURVEY METHODS
The proposed project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence of cultural
resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance and the excavation of
screened shovel tests. Each shovel test was approximately 35 centimeters (cm; 14 inches [in]) in
diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm (8-in) arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below
surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The excavated soil from each shovel test was
passed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen to facilitate the recovery of artifacts. The
location of each shovel test was recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global
positioning system (GPS) unit, and the soil profile exposed in each of the shovel tests was
documented on standardized forms. All areas not intensively investigated due to prior
disturbance were documented. Digital photographs were used to document the survey conditions,
disturbances, and any cultural features observed. All data generated during this project will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion
of the project.

RESULTS
The area investigated during this damage assessment consists largely of the interfluve between
Morrison Creek and an unnamed tributary of Bell Creek. A total of 35.4 acres was assessed,
encompassing a 300-ft (91-m) buffer around the 4.4-acre fracture pond and a 50-ft-wide (15-m­
wide) buffer along the 2,690-linear-ft long lease road associated with the fracture pond. Forty
shovel tests were excavated during this damage assessment (Figure 6). A total of three
prehistoric artifacts was recovered in three shovel tests along the lease road. One piece of chert
debitage was recovered in Shovel Test (ST) 2 within the upper 20 cm (8 in) of the subsurface. No
additional artifacts were recovered either in the three shovel tests excavated in 10-m intervals
around ST 2 or in one shovel test excavated on the opposite side of the lease road (Figure 7).
In ST 25, one piece of silicified wood debitage was recovered between 40 and 50 cm (16 and 20
in) below the surface. One crude silicified wood biface, approximating the Middle-to-Late
Archaic period Williams type (Figure 8), was recovered within the uppermost 20 cm (8 in) of ST
28, excavated 10 m (33 ft) to the west of ST 25. No artifacts were recovered in the 10 additional
shovel tests excavated in 10-m (33-ft) intervals around STs 25 and 28 (see Figure 7).

RECOMMENDATIONS
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When artifacts are
encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive
excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation shovel
tests are placed to define the boundary of the site. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests
are encountered and contain at least five artifacts representing two classes of cultural materials, a
site is defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. Thus, the three prehistoric artifacts
encountered during the course of this damage assessment (Table 3) do not constitute an
archeological site. The presence of these artifacts is more likely to represent isolated or sporadic
episodes of prehistoric activity.
This damage assessment did not encounter any historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4.
The upland setting and the scarcity of a reliable water supply indicate that prehistoric
archeological remains within the project area are not likely to be extensive. Historic remains
(e.g., remains of early farmsteads or tenant houses), although more likely to be encountered
within the region, were not observed during this survey. Based on the results of this damage
assessment, there is a very low potential for deposits containing significant archeological
materials within the project area and it is unlikely that the construction of the fracture pond and
its associated lease road disturbed or destroyed significant cultural deposits.
