Abstract
In March 2015, staff from aci consulting conducted an intensive archeological survey
prior to the construction of the proposed Wichita Falls Permanent Indirect Potable
Reuse System Project. The proposed project includes facility improvements to the City's
existing River Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and construction of a 28.3­
km- (17.6-mi-) long reuse pipeline from the WWTP to Lake Arrowhead in Wichita,
Archer, and Clay Counties, Texas. The 123.6-acre (50 hectare) Area of Potential Effects
(APE) for the archeological survey is defined as the 18.3-m- (60-ft-) wide right-of-way
(ROW) for 27.3 km (17 mi) of the proposed pipeline. The remaining 1 km (0.6 mi) at the
southern end of the proposed pipeline will be within Lake Arrowhead and is not
considered part of the ROW for the current investigation. The investigation consisted of
an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, site recording, assessment of sites for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), data analysis, and reporting in accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.
This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26)
under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 7136.
The pedestrian survey resulted in the location of three new archeological sites in
Wichita County (41WC28, 41WC29, and 41WC30). Site 41WC28 consists of a sparse
scatter of historic-age artifacts in a cultivated field. Site 41WC29 appears to represent
the remains of a farmstead and retains evidence of seven structural features and a
canal. Site 41WC30 includes a dense scatter of historic-age artifacts, a roadbed, and a
canal. The portions of the sites within the proposed APE are ineligible for inclusion on
the NRHP or for listing as SALs. Based on these results, no further archeological work
is recommended. Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Jennifer Kimbell served as Principal
Investigator on this project, and Julie Shipp served as Project Archeologist.

1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
The City of Wichita Falls is proposing to undertake improvements to its existing
River Road WWTP and construct a 28.3-km- (17.6-mi-) long reuse pipeline from the
WWTP to Lake Arrowhead in Wichita, Archer, and Clay Counties, Texas. The 123.6­
acre (50-hectare) Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the cultural resources survey is
defined as the 18.3-m- (60-ft-) wide right-of-way (ROW) for the northern 27.3 km (17
mi) of the length of the proposed pipeline (Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2). The
remaining portion of the proposed pipeline will be within Lake Arrowhead (see
Appendix A, Figures 1 and 2). In March 2015 archeologists from aci consulting
conducted an archeological investigation of the proposed project area. The
investigation consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, site
recording, assessment of sites for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), data analysis,
and reporting in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.
Following the completion of fieldwork, a slight modification to the route was
proposed. The newly proposed segment, rather than crossing from northwest to
southeast from near the intersection of Hampton Road and Cottonwood Road to
Hwy 79, runs approximately 254 m (833 ft) east from the Hampton
Road/Cottonwood Road intersection to the western side of an existing power line
corridor and then turns south and travels approximately 346 m (1,135 ft) toward Hwy
79.
This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26)
under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 7136.
The pedestrian survey resulted in the location of three historic-age archeological
sites, 41WC28, 41WC29, and 41WC30. Records from this investigation will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Jennifer Kimbell served as
Principal Investigator on this project, and Julie Shipp served as Project Archeologist.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in the North-Central Plains of Texas. The North-Central
Plains is an erosional surface that developed from various formations of Paleozoic
age, consisting of shale, sandstone, and limestone. The western area of the plains
comprises red and gray rocks that contain a significant amount of gypsum, where
the eastern rocks and soils are primarily tan in color (Wermund 1995). The region
consists mostly of grassland and cropland except for riparian areas along the major
streams. The vegetation type within the APE is mapped as crops and mesquite­
lotebush shrub (McMahan et al. 1984).
2.2 Geology and Soils
The surface geology within the APE is mapped as Quaternary alluvium, Quaternary
terraces, and the Leonard Series (Barnes 1974). Late Quaternary formations
maintain the highest probability of containing archeological sites. However, the
majority of the APE is the Leonardian formation, which is Paleozoic in age and
consists of shale, sandstone, and limestone.
Sixteen soil series are present within the APE (NRCS 2014) (Table 1). Most of these
are eroded upland soils of Permian age. Port silt loam is mapped within recent
floodplains, and if this soil is intact it has the potential to contain buried archeological
deposits (Appendix A, Figure 3).

2.3 Prehistoric Background
The proposed project area falls within the North-Central Texas archeological region.
Prehistoric archeological sites in north-central Texas represent continuous human
occupation starting around 11,500 years before present. A broad definition of
prehistoric periods has been established for this region due to the lack of specific
data. Generally, the archeology of north-central Texas is similar to that of eastcentral Texas, except for the presence of Henrietta Phase sites representing the
Late Prehistoric in the north-central region (Perttula 2004).
The prehistoric chronology can be divided into three main periods, Paleoindian,
Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. Each of these can be further divided into subperiods,
such as early and late, although such distinctions are not necessarily meaningful for
purposes of this investigation. Dates are presented as Before Present or BP in Table
2.

Paleoindian-period sites record a general hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon a wide
variety of fauna including large herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of
plant resources is less common, but it is presumed that local flora were also
important to subsistence. Sites from the Paleoindian period are often composed of
small temporary or seasonal camp sites that tend to be located along the
confluences of small streams and the tributaries of large rivers. Large kill sites are
also prevalent during this period (Perttula 2004).
The shift into the Archaic period is defined primarily by significant changes in
subsistence strategies and variation in tool kits. Grinding stones become more
prevalent at sites that were occupied during this broad time period, indicating an
increased reliance on plant foods that required processing. Projectile points of this
period are generally large stemmed or notched dart points (Perttula 2004).
Camp sites are the most common site type dating to the Archaic period, and kill
sites, such as those associated with the Paleoindian period, are less common.
People living during this period appear to have had a broad spectrum diet, as the
variety of species of flora and fauna that people were exploiting increased. The
Archaic in Texas is generally divided into three subperiods, the Early, Middle, and

City of W ichita Falls Permanent Indirect

2 Background

Late Archaic. Due to the diversity of site types, tools, and subsistence evidence that
have been discovered for this broad period, cultural chronologies are more localized.
Since scant evidence of people living in north-central Texas during the Archaic
period has been recovered so far, defining a precise set of characteristics for the
region is difficult (Perttula 2004).
The Late Prehistoric period is generally characterized by a shift to a more sedentary
lifestyle than existed during the Archaic. Sites from this period are characterized by
the presence of arrow points, indicating a shift to the bow and arrow, and ceramics.
In north-central Texas, the Late Prehistoric is defined by the Henrietta focus of the
Plains Village culture (Perttula 2004). The Plains Villagers were semi-sedentary
people who inhabited the streams of the Southern Plains from approximately 800­
500 BP (Bell and Brooks 2001).
Villagers of the Henrietta focus hunted deer and bison and farmed the sandy
floodplains of the Red and Brazos Rivers and began to utilize bone tools such as
bison scapula hoes. These people built oval houses and produced pottery consisting
of plain shell-tempered bowls and jars (Bell and Brooks 2001).
2.4 Historic Background
European incursions in the eighteenth century into what are now Wichita, Archer,
and Clay Counties were likely common due to the proximity of the project area to the
Red River, a major thoroughfare for French activity; however, the area was not
permanently settled by Europeans until the 1870s. At the time of European entry into
the region, the area was inhabited by Caddoan Indian groups, primarily the Wichita
and Taovayas but also Tawakonis and Kichais (Hart 2010; Lewis 2013). These
native peoples were primarily agriculturalists but had quickly mastered
horsemanship, learning to ride the horses introduced into North America by Spanish
explorers, and they utilized the horse to improve the success of buffalo hunts (Hart
2010). The various Caddoan groups found themselves in conflict with the Apache,
Comanche, and Kiowa, nomadic tribes pushed south by other native peoples during
the eighteenth century.
The land on which the town of Wichita Falls was founded was purchased by John A.
Scott of Mississippi in 1837, although he never made use of the land certificates. In
1876, his heirs commissioned M.W. Seeley to map a town site on that land. A few
European settlers were living in the area at the time, trading in buffalo hides and
living off the land, and others gradually joined the community. A post office was
established in 1879, and in 1881 the Fort Worth and Denver Railway Company laid
tracks from Fort Worth to Wichita Falls. The arrival of the railroad was followed by a
boom in town population and by the establishment of several businesses. Population
growth was further encouraged by the addition of other railroads near the turn of the
century. The 1890 city population of fewer than 2,000 grew to over 5,000 by 1907.

2 Background

Outside the city of Wichita Falls, the region was dominated by cattle ranching and
corn and hay farming (Hart 2010).
The discovery of oil outside of Wichita Falls in the decade following 1900 prompted a
shift in economic base, and the opening of several oil fields encouraged the
development of refineries within the city. During World War I Call Field, an Army Air
Corps training facility, was built south of the city, and cotton joined corn and hay as a
major agricultural product in the region (Hart 2010). The 1920s saw Wichita Falls
carried forward with a strong economy based on oil production, and this same
industry helped insulate the city from the effects of the Great Depression. According
to Hart (2010), by 1940 Wichita County “had become Texas's most productive and
active oil county, having produced 320,000,000 barrels of oil.” The opening of
Sheppard Field, now Sheppard Air Force Base, in 1941 encouraged additional
growth. By 1955 the population of Wichita Falls had grown to over 110,000, but with
the decline in oil production in the early 1960s the city population began to decline.
In 1979, one of the largest tornadoes ever recorded devastated the City of Wichita
Falls. The storm destroyed an estimated twenty percent of the dwellings in town and
killed forty-five people. Recovery from the storm was rapid, and the oil boom of the
early 1980s encouraged rebuilding. The oil boom was short lived, however, and the
late 1980s saw stagnation in the city and a significant slowing in population growth
(Hendrickson 2010).

3 Literature Review

3 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) revealed that
none of the APE had been previously surveyed and that no archeological sites had
been previously recorded within the APE or within one kilometer of the APE. Three
small areas had been previously surveyed within one kilometer of the APE, although
the Atlas contains little information about these surveys (Appendix A, Figure 4).
The earliest of the previous surveys was conducted in 1995 for the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT). This
survey was located approximately 250 m (820 ft) east of the APE near the
intersection of SH 82 and Fisher Road. Another survey was conducted in 2000 for
the petroleum plant on the south side of Harding Street, approximately 500 m (1,600
ft) to the north of the APE. A 2007 survey was conducted by AR Consultants for the
City of Wichita Falls, approximately 500 m (1,600 ft) to the east of the APE at the
intersection of Harding Street and Thompson Road.

4 Methods

4 METHODS
Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey of the APE in an
effort to locate any archeological or historical sites that might be adversely affected
by construction of the proposed reuse pipeline. The pedestrian survey was
conducted in two transects along the 18.3-m- (60-ft-) wide APE (see Appendix A,
Figures 1 and 2). The pedestrian survey was augmented by shovel testing; no
deposits requiring backhoe trenching were encountered.
Shovel tests were excavated in settings that had potential for buried cultural
horizons and/or if the ground surface visibility was less than 30 percent. They were
excavated at least 30 cm (approximately 12 in) in diameter to the bottom of
Holocene deposits. The shovel tests were dug in 20-cm (approximately 8-in) levels,
and the excavated sediments were screened through ¼-in hardware cloth unless
high clay or water content required that the material be troweled through or sorted by
hand. Shovel tests were recorded on purpose-designed logs, and the locations of
the tests were recorded on a handheld GPS unit. Other field forms included a daily
journal, photograph log, and site forms.
There are floodplains within the APE that are mapped as Port silt loam (see
Appendix A, Figure 3), which is Holocene alluvium and thus has a high potential to
contain buried archeological sites. However, the subsoil has been mapped as
shallow as 22 cm (9 in) below the ground surface, and the soils in the region are
typically highly eroded. Field reconnaissance revealed no deep soils requiring
backhoe trenching, even within the Holocene floodplain.
Newly discovered sites were assigned temporary field designations, and digital
TexSite Archeological Data Collection forms were submitted to TARL for the
assignment of trinomials. The location of each archeological site was recorded on a
USGS 7.5-minute topographic map, and a sketch map was drawn showing the
location of all salient features at the sites. The site setting and features were
photographed. This was a non-collection survey, and any diagnostic artifacts
encountered were photographed and drawn in the field. Surface visibility at the three
newly recorded sites was not less than 30 percent, so shovel tests were not
necessary for delineating site boundaries. Each of the newly recorded sites was
evaluated for potential significance and for eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP or for
listing as a SAL. The survey methods complied with THC and CTA standards for site
investigation.

5 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
During the intensive archeological survey three isolated finds (IFs), two composed of
possible pieces of stone debitage and one comprising two fragments of coarse
stoneware, were noted, and three historic-period sites, 41WC28, 41WC29, and
41WC30, were discovered and recorded. Shovel test locations (n=27), isolated finds,
and site boundaries are shown in Figure 5 of Appendix A. Appendix B is a table of
the shovel test results.
5.1 Isolated Finds
IF1
IF1, a single piece of stone debitage, was found approximately 800 m (2,625 ft)
southwest of FM1954 and 735 m (2,411 ft) north of Bridwell Road (Appendix A,
Figure 5; Photo 1). No other artifacts were observed in the area, and the artifact
seemed to be out of its original context.

IF2
IF2, a possible fragment of stone debitage, was located approximately 1,510 m
(4,954 ft) south of FM1954 and 660 m (2,165 ft) west of Pocahontas Trail (see
Appendix A, Figure 5). The fragment is of a relatively coarse stone, so positively
identifying it as debitage from the production of a stone tool is problematic (Photo 2).

The item was in a heavily disturbed area and was clearly not found in its original
context.

IF3
IF3, which comprised two fragments of coarse stoneware, was located
approximately 26 m (85 ft) south of the current stream channel of Holliday Creek
(see Appendix A, Figure 5; Photo 3). One shovel test, DB05, placed near IF3,
yielded glass fragments from the top 20 cm (8 in) of fill. No other artifacts and no
features were observed in the vicinity of IF3.

5.2 Sites
41WC28
Site 41WC28 comprises a scatter of early- to mid-twentieth-century domestic
artifacts and building materials spanning the boundary between a winter wheat field
and a fallow field within a flat upland area. The scatter measured approximately 120
meters (400 feet) north to south and 80 meters (260 feet) east to west. No structural
features were observed, and artifact density was low. Artifacts included bricks and
brick fragments, coarse stoneware, glass fragments, and a single metal spike
(Photos 5 and 6). One shovel test, JS07, placed within the scatter, was negative for
subsurface cultural material.
Due to a lack of structural features and the sparse artifact concentration, this site
meets no criteria for eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL. The
site retains no integrity, and no further archeological investigation is recommended.

41WC29
Site 41WC29 appears to date to the early to mid-twentieth century and likely
represents the remains of a farmstead. Within the project APE, the site is ineligible
for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL. The site was documented in the
field due to landowner permission to cross outside the APE on that parcel, although
eligibility of the site as a whole was not assessed. The site measures at least 130 m
(427 ft) from north to south by 200 m (656 ft) from west to east and retains seven
structural features as well as a canal:
Feature 1 comprises an outbuilding, probably a barn (Appendix A, Figure 6). This
two-part structure is constructed of wood but patched in places with corrugated
metal. The two sections of the building are divided by a wooden wall that runs more
or less east/west below the roof peak. The larger, southern section has a dirt floor
and a wooden trough and may never have been enclosed on the south face. The
roof is covered with corrugated metal. The north side has a wooden floor and a
doorway facing east. The west wall of this portion of the structure is gone. There is
no visible foundation but red bricks were scattered nearby (Photo 7).

Feature 2 is a second outbuilding, also possibly a barn (see Appendix A, Figure 6).
This feature is smaller than and north of Feature 1. Feature 2 comprises a three-part
structure with partitions running approximately north and south, parallel to the roof
peak, and a doorway facing south. The central part of the building is framed with

wood but has corrugated metal walls. The western and eastern portions of the
structure may have never been completely enclosed; they are roofed and have
some wooden supports but no walls. A dilapidated fence composed of wood and
corrugated metal surrounds the western portion of the structure, which contains a
wooden trough (Photo 8).

Feature 3 is a small structure similar to a Quonset hut, located immediately east of
Feature 2 (see Appendix A, Figure 6). The building is made of corrugated metal that
is now heavily rusted. The doorway to the structure faces east, away from Feature 2
(see Photo 8, Photo 9).

Feature 4 likely represents a septic tank. It is located on a slope, with a portion of the
feature on the terrace and the base of the feature on the floodplain (see Appendix A,
Figure 6). The upper, or southern, portion of the feature includes a surface of broken
concrete over a space that is either entirely or partially hollow (Photo 10). At least
one large metal drain plate is affixed to the concrete over the hollow space. The
lower, or northern, portion of the feature comprises a large hollow box of red brick
and mortar construction that measures approximately 2 m (7 ft) from east to west by
2.7 m (9 ft) from north to south by 0.9 m (3 ft) tall (Photo 11). Two ceramic pipes
empty into the tank on the south side, and a 15-cm- (6-in-) diameter ceramic pipe
juts out from near the top of the north face of the brick box. The ceramic pipe is
stamped "W.S. Dickey" and was likely produced by the W.S. Dickey Clay
Manufacturing Company, a major producer of burnt clay products between the late
nineteenth and mid twentieth centuries. The brick enclosure is divided into 2
reservoirs and has a flat concrete roof with an inset square of concrete that can be
lifted off to provide access. A trash scatter adjacent to the south side of the feature
included green, amber, and clear glass. There is a large scatter of bricks and
concrete chunks on the terrace and along the slope near Feature 4. This debris field
includes several large slabs of concrete with randomly oriented bricks incorporated
into one surface. The original context of these slabs is unknown.

Feature 5 comprises a hollow concrete rectangle that may represent a foundation or
a shallow tank, located on the floodplain portion of the site (see Appendix A, Figure
6). The concrete is approximately 18 cm (7 in) thick, and the walls taper at the top,
approximately 20 cm (8 in) above the ground. Near the center of the western side of
the rectangle, a smaller rectangle of concrete juts out toward the west. The feature
measures approximately 3.7 m (12 ft) from west to east by 9 m (30 ft) from north to
south (Photo 12).

Photo 12. Feature 5 at 41WC29; view is toward south.

Feature 6 appears to be a concrete foundation of unknown purpose (see Appendix
A, Figure 6). The foundation measures approximately 1.8 m (6 ft) from southwest to
northeast by 3 m (10 ft) from southeast to northwest with a thicker, raised, 1-m-by­
1.4-m (3.5-ft-by-4.5-ft) hollow platform (Photo 13).

tributary stream and was then modified for improved flow. The canal runs roughly
west-southwest to east-northeast, and its western and eastern extents are unknown
(see Appendix A, Figure 6). At the time of the archeological investigation, the canal
was dry. The feature measures approximately 4.6 m (15 ft) wide, and the berms that
define its edges are approximately 1.2 m (4 ft) high (Photo 15).

Photo 15. Feature 8, canal, at 41WC29; view is toward northeast.

Two shovel tests, JS11, on the south side of Feature 8, and JS12, east of Feature 3,
each contained one fragment of glass in the top 10 cm (4 in) of fill. JS13 yielded two
fragments of unidentified animal bone from the top 10 cm (4 in); the bone is not
necessarily cultural in origin.
While no residential structure was identified, the site likely extends outside the area
examined, and the features recorded are consistent with those associated with a
moderate or large early- to mid-twentieth century farmstead. Additional archival and
historic research would be necessary to determine the purpose and significance of
the site and whether site 41WC29 is eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing
as a SAL. However, the proposed APE does not impact any of the remaining
structures, and no diagnostic artifacts were found within the project APE. The only
site feature that is impacted by the proposed APE is the canal. Only a portion of the
canal will be impacted, leaving other representative sections intact. In short the site
is ineligible within the project APE. Consequently, no further investigation is
recommended at this site unless the proposed ROW shifts to impact one or more of
the remaining structural features. Further investigation, including archival research
and additional archeological examination, to determine site eligibility is
recommended if future development threatens to impact portions of the site outside
the current project APE.

5 Results of Investigation

41WC30
Site 41WC30 is located approximately 500 m (1,640 ft) northwest of site 41WC29.
This site appears to represent the remains of an early- to mid-twentieth-century
home or store, although it could also be simply a trash disposal location. The scatter
of historic-age materials is located in a heavily disturbed area approximately 500 m
(1,640 ft) southeast of the current WWTP and immediately west of a utility
easement. East of the utility easement is a bulldozed area that appears to be a
gravel quarry or a large construction staging site. Overall, the site measures
approximately 63 m (207 ft) from northwest to southeast by approximately 38 m (125
ft) from southwest to northeast.
The site is situated over and between two raised berms that run roughly west to
east. Numerous glass bottles and fragments, some ceramics of varying quality and
type, several metal items, and some building materials were noted (Photo 16). The
artifacts tended to be domestic in nature rather than industrial. Specific items noted
included parts of several white porcelain toilets; fragments of ceramic dishes and
cups displaying various decorative motifs; pieces of glass drinking vessels and
medicine and cosmetic bottles and jars; enameled metal cups, a pitcher, and a
teapot; and brick fragments. The site is bounded on the northeast by the utility
easement, and the other extents of the site were determined based on artifact
distributions. No evidence of structural features was observed, although an
abandoned roadbed and a grassy canal were located south of the primary
concentration of artifacts (Appendix A, Figure 7). Whether the roadbed and canal are
temporally or functionally associated with the historic scatter or with one another is
unclear. The roadbed is approximately 3 m (10 ft) wide and was visible on the
surface as a strip of ground that was less overgrown than the surrounding area.

5 Results of Investigation

Photo 16. Sample of artifact scatter at site 41WC30.

Two shovel tests, DB06 on the south side of the canal and JS10 on the north side of
the canal, were both positive for subsurface cultural material. DB06 contained one
fragment of bottle glass between 20 and 75 cm (8 and 30 in) below the surface.
JS10 yielded four fragments of clear glass, two fragments of amber glass, four
sherds of whiteware, and two fragments of slate, all from between the surface and
50 cm (20 in) below the surface.
Pinpointing specific dates for the artifacts observed at site 41WC30 is difficult, as the
embossing on glass bottles and jars is usually less date-specific than are paper
labels, none of which were preserved at the site. One clear glass bottle, tentatively
identified as a vinegar bottle, may have been manufactured in 1927, based on the
embossed design on the bottle base (Photo 17) (Lockhart et al. 2010).

5 Results of Investigation

Photo 17. Possible vinegar bottle from site 41WC30.

Site 41WC30 retains no site integrity. Other than the roadbed and canal, no features
were observed, and the relationship between the scatter of artifacts and the roadbed
and canal is unknown. If the artifacts were once associated with a structure, the
remains of that structure are either well outside of the survey area or are completely
gone. The proposed project will impact sections of the roadbed and canal but will
leave other representative portions intact. While shovel tests were positive for
cultural material, their contents reflect deep disturbance to the ground rather than
the presence of in situ artifacts. Based on these observations, the portion of site
41WC30 within the project APE is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing
as a SAL. No further archeological investigation is recommended.

6 Conclusions and Recommendations

6 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Prior to the construction of a proposed reuse pipeline in Wichita, Archer, and Clay
Counties, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey
and shovel testing in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a proposed
APE measuring approximately 27.3 km (17 mi) long by 18.3 m (60 ft) wide (123.6
acres) under Texas Antiquities Permit number 7136.
Following the completion of fieldwork, a slight modification to the route was
proposed (see Appendix A, Figure 5, page 1 of 6). The newly proposed segment,
rather than crossing from northwest to southeast from near the intersection of
Hampton Road and Cottonwood Road to Hwy 79, runs approximately 254 m (833 ft)
east from the Hampton Road/Cottonwood Road intersection to the western side of
an existing power line corridor and then turns south and travels approximately 346 m
(1,135 ft) toward Hwy 79. Because the area is considered to have a low probability
for the presence of buried archeological remains and because of obvious
disturbance to the area in which the proposed reroute is located, no additional
survey was undertaken and none is recommended for this approximately 600-m
(1,968-ft) newly proposed segment.
Three new historic sites, 41WC28, 41WC29, and 41WC30, were discovered and
recorded during the current field effort. Site 41WC28 is a scatter of early- to mid­
twentieth-century domestic debris. Due to the lack of intact cultural deposits and the
level of disturbance at the site, the site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL.
Site 41WC29 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century site, probably a farmstead,
retaining seven structural features and a canal. The only site feature that is impacted
by the proposed APE is the canal, and only a portion of it will be impacted, leaving
other representative sections intact. Without additional archival and historical
research, the eligibility of site 41WC29 for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a
SAL is impossible to determine. However, the portion of the site within the proposed
APE is ineligible due to a lack of intact features or diagnostic materials.
Site 41WC30, a historic-age scatter, was heavily disturbed. A roadbed and canal
also cross the APE near the scatter, although the relationship of any one component
of the site to any other cannot be determined without additional research. Proposed
impacts to the roadbed and canal will leave remaining segments of both intact.
Therefore, the portion of the site within the APE is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL.
Based on the results of this archeological survey, no further archeological work is
recommended at sites 41WC28, 41WC29, or 41WC30 as long as the proposed APE
does not change. It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be
guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a project area. Therefore, should

6 Conclusions and Recommendations

human remains or archeological resources be discovered during the course of
construction for this project, the client will contact the THC. Additional archival work
and the collection of additional information regarding historic site 41WC29 is
recommended if any of the farmstead’s structural features will be impacted by a
project requiring compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code or with Section 106 of
the NHPA in the future.
