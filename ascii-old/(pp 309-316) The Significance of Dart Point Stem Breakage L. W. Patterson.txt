The Significance of Dart Point
Ste Breakage

Lo Wo Patterson

ABSTRACT
A pattern of possible dart shaft and foreshaft reuse is developed from the frequency of dart
point stem fragments with transverse fractures found at archeological sites in Central and
Southeast Texas. Dart point blade fracture patterns also are considered, as related to damage
during the hunt and subsequent reworking. Good comparisons are shown between surface collected and excavated assemblages in Harris County.

INTRODUCTION
Stem pieces are the most common type of dart point fragments found on
archeological sites studied in the Lake Limestone area on the eastern edge
of Central Texas (upper Navasota River area east of Waco) (Prewitt,
1974:62, 1975:17). Prewitt (1974, 1975) suggested that basal fragments of
dart points found at campsites may be the result of retrieval and reuse of dart
shafts and foreshafts. Points were broken during the hunt. New points
would be refitted upon the user’s return to camp, and basal fragments
discarded at the campsite.
To test Prewitt’s (1974, 1975) hypothesis, data from two other areas of
Texas were examined. One location was Harris County, in the greater
Houston area. This area is on the upper Texas coast in Southeast Texas, approximately 150 mi southeast of Prewitt’s (1974, 1975) study area. The
other location was Bandera County in Southcentral Texas, approximately
50 mi northwest of San Antonio. Bandera County is about 240 mi west of
Harris County and approximately 210 mi southwest of Prewitt’s (1974,
1975) location.
The three locations (Fig. 1) are far enough apart that any consistent conclusions reached could be considered to be regional patterns for the eastern
and central areas of Texas involved. Current inventories of dart points and
fragments from archeological sites in Harris and Bandera counties were
used to developed data. Quantitative confirmation of general impressions
on dart breakage patterns for sites (Patterson, 1974, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c,
1976a, 1976b, 1977, 1978a, 1978b, 1979a) was generated.
In order to develop a more complete picture of what may have happened
at archeological sites, it was necessary to consider other types of dart point
breakage. Therefore, dart point blade breakage patterns also are discussed.
There is a good match of dart point breakage patterns for surface collections
and an excavated site in Harris County. This match gives support to the

value of data from surface collection for some types of archeological interpretation.
DART POINT BREAKAGE PATTERNS
Dart points generally are believed to have been used in a weapon system
consisting of a spear thrower (atlatl), a spear shaft, and a hafted lithic projectile point (Chard, 1975:Fig. 12-5). Projectile points could be hafted directly
to a single shaft; or a compound shaft could be used, with the point hafted
to a removable foreshaft. Although made from perishable wood materials,
some archeological remains of spear throwers (Aikens, 1979:Fig. 114;
Hester et al., 1974; Willey, 1966:Fig. 4-18) and foreshafts with hafted
points (Schuetz, 1960:Fig. 2b; Willey, 1966, Fig. 4-18) have been
recovered. Lithic projectile points weighing over 3 gr are classified as dart
points, in contrast to lighter, smaller arrowpoints (Patterson, 1976c:Fig. 4).
Dart points found on archeological sites could have been broken for a
number of reasons, including surface disturbances by modern man. If the
assumption can be made that most dart point breakage occurred during
original site occupation, breakage patterns might furnish some information
on specific site activities (Roper, 1979:113). Data developed for this study
do not indicate that fortuitous dart point breakage, either prehistoric or
historic, was an important factor in overall dart point breakage patterns. If
fortuitous breakage were statistically significant, large numbers of matching

dart point pieces should be recovered from intensive surface collecting and
excavations. This recovery rate was not observed in the data used.
Few quantitative studies of dart point breakage patterns are available.
Roper’s (1979) recent study of this type is largely inconclusive. Roper
(1979:Table 2) presented some data on longitudinal breakage of stems; but
did not give data on transverse stem fractures, which is the more common
breakage pattern in data reviewed.
There are two breakage locations for stemmed dart points, stem breakage
and blade fractures. Most stem breakage on archeological sites reviewed involved transverse fractures near the point where the stem joins the dart
point blade. This stem breakage pattern is the one under consideration.
Blade breakage seems to occur in a variety of directions, ranging from
transverse to longitudinal. It is discussed along with the possible causes of
blade breakage.
DART POINT BREAKAGE CAUSES
Activities during the hunt is one of the principle causes of dart point
breakage that can be postulated. During hunting activities, points may have
been broken during impact; or points tightly wedged in an animal may have
been snapped by leverage to retrieve the shaft or foreshaft. If projectile
points were broken during hunting, fragments remaining in a hafted position
would be stem fragments or more complete points with broken blades. If
spear shafts and/or foreshafts with broken points were being carried back to
camp for refitting projectile points, there should be disproportionate higher
percentages of these two types of dart point fragments at campsites. Data
presented (Tables 1-3) show that this disproportionate pattern of point
fragments occurs at the widely separated campsites studied.
If hafted projectile points also were used as knives for butchering activities, physical stresses might cause stem breakage during this type of activity. Due to shape, it is less likely that cutting function would cause many
blade fractures except on delicate tips. If this type of use caused stem
breakage at campsites, it would be expected to find approximately equal
amounts of dart point stem fragments and points with broken stems. This
situation is not the case for data reviewed. Many dart points would not make
very good cutting tools due to rough and steeply beveled edges. At campsites, large chert flakes with sharp edges would have been generally superior
to the reuse of dart points as knives (Patterson, 1975d). A bifacial edge must
have a very acute angle (25° or less) to approach the cutting efficiency of a
sharp flake (Patterson, 1976d).
During the hunt, it may have been convenient for Indians to use dart
points as expedient cutting tools. If stem breakage occurred from this activity, it would be difficult to separate this cause from other stem breakage during the hunt. Therefore, this study is only concerned with whether or not
stem breakage occurred at remote hunting locations away from campsites.
Regardless of specific point breakage cause, shafts and foreshafts could
have been carried back to campsites for refitting of new points.
Manufacturing failure is another possible cause of dart point breakage.
This cause is not considered important since the author’s experience in experimental flintknapping and observation of other flintknappers is that most

manufacturing failures occur during bifacial preform thinning. Failures show
up as generalized biface fragments lacking finely pressure retouched edges.
Preform failures can be separated from finished dart point fragments. Stem
breakage during dart point manufacture is rare since stems are formed by
pressure flaking, which produces little breakage.
Some broken dart points could have been reworked into smaller serviceable points at campsites. This reworking would be done mainly by
reshaping of broken blades. This activity would complicate the analysis of
dart point fragments as numerous blade fragments could be produced during reworking of a broken dart point. There were few examples of reworked
dart points in the data reviewed, although some reworking may have occurred which was not obvious.

ARCHEOLOGICAL

DATA

Archeological collections from several sites in Texas were examined for
dart point breakage patterns. Table 1 is a tabulation of data from eight surface collected sites in Harris County. Dart point specimens are typica! types
of the Archaic and Early Woodland periods of the upper Texas coast (Suhm
and Jelks, 1962; Patterson, 1979b). These dart points (Fig. 2) include expanding, straight, and contracting stem point types (e.g., Gary, Kent,~
Bulverde, Yarbrough, and Ellis).
All sites have more stem fragments than points with stem fractures (Table
1). The total collection has over 10 times as many stem fragments as points
with stem fractures. This disproportionate pattern is not present in comparing blade fragments and points with blade fractures. The number of blade
fragments and points with broken blades is approximately equal. However,
there is not a particular geometrical match between blade fragments and
points with broken blades. Some points with broken blades may be from
breakage during the hunt and some miscellaneous blade fragments could be
from reworking of broken points.
Data were tabulated for a well excavated site in Harris County (41HR315;
Patterson, 1978a) as a comparison with surface collections (Table 1). Data
are summarized (Table 2) from all excavated levels of 41HR315, spanning a
total time period from the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic (starting approximately 7,000 BP) to the Late Prehistoric (ending approximately AD 1500).
A culturally mixed area is included that appears to have been the result of a
prehistoric erosion episode.
The dart point breakage pattern (Table 2) is similar to the surface collections (Table 1) from the same county. There are over five times as many
stem fragments as points with stem fractures and an approximately equal
number of blade fragments and points with blade breakage. The collection
from 41HR315 represents a 10% sample of the total site area. The overall
dart point breakage for surface and excavated collections (Tables 1, 2) also
is fairly similar. For the surface collections, there are 3.6 times as many dart
point pieces as whole dart points. For the excavated site, there are 2.5 times
as many dart point pieces as whole dart points.
Dart point breakage for two surface collected sites in Bandera County are
summarized (Table 3). There is a large difference in numbers of stem
fragments and points with stem fractures, with 12.5 times more stem

fragments. There are 2.6 times as manyblade fragments as points with
blade fractures.
J.B. Sollberger (personal communication) tried to match up surface collected dart point fragments from Kerr County. A large number of stem
fragments without corresponding numbers of other complimentary types of
fragments were identified.
CONCLUSIONS
Archeological data presented support Prewitt’s (1974, 1975) hypothesis
that dart points were broken more often on hunting trips than at campsites,
especially as related to stem fractures. Indians returned to campsites with
basal fragments of dart points still attached to spear shafts. The geographical
spacing of archeological sites examined supports a regional rather than local
pattern of dart point breakage.
The data used were from overall lithic collections of significant sizes and
should represent random samples. Blade breakage patterns of dart points
examined are different from stem breakage patterns. Blade breakage pattern might relate to reworking of broken points and some fortuitous
breakage. Some points with broken blades may be the result of point
breakage during the hunt. It may be that spear points were regarded as expendable items, while good quality spear shafts and foreshafts were held as
valued items for more permanent use.
Comparison of dart point breakage patterns for surface collected and excavated materials does not show any particular bias. The value of study of
surface collections is underrated. All types of archeological remains are imperfect samples of materials from past use; and all types of archeological
data should be considered to obtain the largest data base.
