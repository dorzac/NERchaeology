ABSTRACT
An intensive cultural resource survey of the extended San Miguel Prospect, a 5.583 acre
tract in Atascosa and McMullen counties, was carried out by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, for the San Miguel Electric Cooperative in the
summer of 1985. Forty-one prehistoric sites were recorded. The reassessment of ten known
sites resulted in the combination of three under one number, 41MC106, and identification of one
historic component (41MC102) that met recording criteria. The latter is the now-destroyed home
of Frank Burmeister., German immigrant and later State Representative. Information provided
by descendants has permitted a reconstruction of family history, ranch layout and activities that
compensates for the poor condition of the archeological remains.
The distribution of prehistoric occupation across physiographic zones and by site type
follows the model derived by Shafer and Baxter from their initial San Miguel survey in 1974. The
Prospect sites are generally highly disturbed by erosion, modern land use and soil dynamics.
Despite the overall poverty of intact cultural residues, 21 of the Prospect sites may yield some
additional information pertinent to later research into South Texas settlement. Data recovery is
recommended for those sites if they are to be affected by mine enlargement.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
As a prerequisite for an application for a permit to surface mine lignite deposits in
a 5.583 acre tract, an extension of the current San Miguel Prospect, the San Miguel
Electric Cooperative sponsored an intensive cultural resource survey by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. The project area
lies on the upland divide of the Frio and Atascosa rivers, between the headwaters of La
Parita and La Jarita creeks. The McMullen – Atascosa county line bisects the Prospect.
In 1974, the initial San Miguel Prospect was surveyed and assessed by Shafer
and Baxter (1975) who generated a model of prehistoric settlement from their findings.
This model was compared to earlier suggestions offered by Hester (1971) in Zavala
County and formed part of the theoretical basis for later studies in Choke Canyon
Reservoir. Basically, Shafer and Baxter postulated that multifunctional sites, roughly
equivalent to base camps, would transcend the minor physiographic zonation of the
uplands. The magnitude of use and reuse of specific locations could be directly
attributed to the quantity and quality of water sources. Limited function and specialized
procurement sites differed from the multifunctional category in density and diversity of
artifactual material and, to some degree, size. Ten sites recorded by Shafer and Baxter
fall within the present study area.
The intensive survey was conducted between May 20, 1985 and July 19, 1985
under the field supervision of Bruce A. Nightengale, assisted by William A. Cloud and
Don Lloyd. Historic research was carried out by Henry B. Moncure. Solveig A. Turpin
served as Principal Investigator and authored segments of this report. David G.
Robinson contributed the archeological background, revised from a prior literature
search sponsored by San Miguel Cooperative as a planning document. The collected
background was written by Henry B. Moncure. Analysis and reporting occupied the
period from July 22, 1985 through December 31, 1985.
Field survey was accomplished by pedestrian transect coverage. All exposures
such as cutbanks, gullies, and modern disturbances were emphasized. Limited
subsurface probes were dug at prehistoric sites that showed some potential for buried
deposits to determine the extent and depth of cultural material and to assess its context.
No standing structures within the prospect met the 50 year age criteria. The one historic
ruin was researched through archival searches and informant interviews. All sites were
recorded on standard University of Texas Site Data forms, photographed and plotted on
project and USGS topographic quadrangle maps. Aerial photographs from 1946 were
consulted to determine the extent of historic modification and for evidence of potentially
significant structures. A sample of artifacts was collected, their provenience plotted on
sketched site maps. All specimens and documentation are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

The ten previously recorded sites were re-evaluated. Two sites, 41MC124 and
41MC125 were found to be contiguous with 41MC106 and were combined under that
number. In addition, the one potentially significant historic component located by the
survey was found on the larger prehistoric site, 41MC102. Forty-one prehistoric sites
were recorded, bringing the total within the extended prospect to 49. Their distribution
across the three physiographic zones of the prospect, valley, upland margin and upland
divide, conforms with the settlement model set forth by Shafer and Baxter for the initial
San Miguel Prospect. Their distinction between multiple and limited function sites was
retained as the site typology and although the two site types were spread across the
physiographic zones, the more complex sites tended to cluster in the valley and margins
and the more specific sites on the upland divides.
The Prospect sites have been greatly affected by cultural and natural processes.
Erosion, in the form of sheetwash runoff and deflation, has been accelerated by the soil
dynamics typical of the shrink-swell clays of the Prospect. Artifact collection has greatly
reduced the number of temporally and functionally diagnostic tool forms available for
study. These factors have drastically reduced the scientific potential for the entire study
area sample and specifically eliminate 28 of the 39 prospect sites from further
consideration.
Seven of the 21 remaining sties are outside the mining zone and will not be
affected under the current plan. Subsurface testing is only feasible in residual areas of
deeper soils on three sites in the valley physiographic zone, 41MC102, 41MC362 and
41MC366, and one on the upland divide, 41AT87. The latter is also the sole upland
divide limited function site with this potential. The eleven remaining sites can profit only
from surface collection and mapping of artifact concentrations.
The one historic component, at 41MC102, is the now-leveled remains of the
Burmeister ranch headquarters, built in 1902 by prominent South Texas lawyer, rancher
and politician, Frank Burmeister. Although the archeological potential of the site has
been greatly diminished by modern land use, the ranch layout and activities have been
so thoroughly documented in a privately printed book by Gustave Burmeister that
additional work can contribute little beyond what has been accomplished by this survey.

INTRODUCTION
Between May 20 and July 19, 1985, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, conducted a cultural resource
survey of 5,583 acres in the San Miguel Lignite Prospect in Atascosa and McMullen
counties (Fig. 1). An additional 640 acres, inaccessible at the time of the survey, will be
investigated once entry rights have been granted. This study was sponsored by
Morrison-Knudsen Company, Inc., agents for the San Miguel Electric Co-op, in
compliance with provisions of the State Surface Mining Act, prerequisite to application
for lignite surface mining. This survey is a continuation of cultural resource assessment
begun in 1974 by Texas A&M University (Shafer and Baxter 1975; Usrey, Grysinski and
Bond 1978; Usrey 1980). Limited portions of the present study area had been surveyed
in 1975; the ten sites recorded at that time were reassessed during the 1985 survey and
three were combined under one site number. In addition, 41 prehistoric sites were
recorded and their distribution and attributes compared with previous settlement models
for the prospect and the South Texas area (Shafer and Baxter 1975; Hester 1976a,
1976b, 1980, 1981). Only one historic component, the former Burmeister home at
41MC102, meets the minimum age criteria for site recording. Twenty-one sites have
been recommended for further work to evaluate their eligibility for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places. The remaining 28 sites are considered too
disturbed by erosion and land modifications to yield meaningful information. In other
cases, only a small portion of the site lies within the prospect. Those extending onto
private property should be fully recorded if the prospect is enlarged to include them.
The field survey was conducted by staff archeologists Bruce A. Nightengale,
William A. Cloud and Don Lloyd. The lithic analysis was done by William A. Cloud; the
historic research and environmental background by Henry B. Moncure and the
archeological background was contributed by David G. Robinson. Solveig A. Turpin
acted as principal investigator and wrote the entries on the Burmeister home
(41MC102).
The survey was designed to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 and its regulations (36CFR800) and the National Environmental Policy Act and its
related regulations (50CFR4) as implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency.
This cultural resource assessment conforms to criteria and guidelines set forth by the
Texas Historical Commission for Phase II intensive survey and performance standards
recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
LOCATION
The study area, a land tract totaling 5,583 acres (Fig. 1), is an extension of the
current San Miguel Lignite Prospect and is adjacent to the present surface mine. Its
approximate center is 55 air miles due south of the center of San Antonio, Texas. The
tract is bisected east/west by the boundary line between Atascosa and McMullen
counties of south central Texas.
Tilden, the McMullen County seat ten miles south southwest, and Christine, an
Atascosa County community seven miles due north, are the closest population centers.
The tiny, unincorporated community of Cross lies south southwest, and Texas State
Highway 16 passes north/south a mile west of the study area. Ranch to Market Road
791 leads to the study area from the State Highway.
The polyangular shape of the Prospect results from it being the composite of
several adjacent land areas surveyed in the irregular, rectangular pattern that was
common in Texas and a legacy of the American South and of Mexico.

GEOLOGY
The dominant geologic formation in the Prospect, and among the reasons for the
sponsor’s selection of a mining area, is the lignite-bearing Jackson Group. South of the
Atascosa River, this geologic group has been characterized as typically including 61 to
215 meters (200-700 ft) of mud, sand and lignite lying between the Yegua Formation
and the more muddy Middle Jackson (Kaiser, Ayers and Labrie 1980:14). The Jackson
Group series of formations extends from Texas’ eastern border in Sabine County to
Zapata County at the Rio Grande. This belt of near-surface lignite-bearing formations
roughly parallels the Gulf Coast at a distance of 90 to 120 miles from its shores, and
forms the border of an area of downwarp and subsidence extending to the Gulf (Renfro
1973: map).
Linear sand bodies oriented with the formations’ strike characterize the lower part
of the Jackson and lignite is associated with maximum sand development (Kaiser,
Ayers and Labrie 1980:16). These sand bodies are interpreted as strandplain/barrierbar sands (Fisher et al. 1970:234-261) and may represent the preserved remnants of
small stream and river deltaic deposits in a shallow lagoon marine environment evolving
to marsh or swamp.

4 / San Miguel Prospect
From core samples taken at the San Miguel mine, Snedden (1979:125-127) has
identified five separate stratigraphic units within the lower Jackson. His findings support
a coastal swamp/coastal lagoon/barrier island depositional environment.
The Jackson Group, in this segment the Whitsett, McElroy and Caddell
formations, is principally sandstones with interbedded shale and lignite layers. Overlying
these in the vicinity of the major creeks are shallow fluviatile terrace deposits of
Pleistocene origin, and narrow, creekside Holocene alluvium (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1976: Map) (Fig. 2) that contains a generous amount of chert-bearing Uvalde
Gravels. These gravels, originating from deposits upstream on San Miguel and
Lagunillas creeks, provided aboriginal inhabitants with a local source of lithic raw
material.
PHYSIOGRAPHY
Fenneman (1938:102-103) assigns the study area to the West Gulf Coastal Plain
Province in a belt termed the Lowlands. The Lowland belt is characterized by low relief;
a contour map of McMullen County, using 50 foot intervals, shows the entire area within
the bounds of a single isarithmic line (Smyer 1952:20), a circumstance which also holds
true for the Atascosa County segment. The region is classified as 50 to 80 percent
gently sloping, with local relief of 100 to 300 feet, and 50 to 75 percent of the gentle
slope in lowlands (Hammond 1964: Map Supplement 4). This low relief and the gentle
overall slope combine to make vegetation the most prominent feature viewed by ground
observers. The occasional erosional washes, some of them severe, are also given
additional prominence by comparison with the surrounding terrain. Three zones were
delineated as analytic units by Shafer and Baxter (1975) in their initial survey of the San
Miguel Lignite Prospect. These physiographic divisions, valley (below 300 ft AMSL),
upland margins (300-350 ft AMSL) and upland divide (above 350 ft AMSL), were
retained during the current survey and analysis (Figs. 3, 4).
HYDROLOGY AND STREAM DRAINAGE
The major aquifer for the study area is the Carrizo-Wilcox. This Eocene
formation, the most extensive in Texas, furnishes water in a wide belt from the Rio
Grande northeastward into Arkansas and Louisiana. It consists of hydrologically
connected ferruginous, cross-bedded sand with clay, sandstone, silt, lignite and gravel
(Muller and Price 1979:17). The Carrizo-Wilcox Formation dips beneath the land
surface toward the Gulf of Mexico and is not exposed in Atascosa or McMullen
counties. In Atascosa County, the aquifer is more than 3,000 feet thick (Muller and Price
1979:18).
A minor aquifer, the Sparta, lies stratigraphically above the Carrizo-Wilcox in
Atascosa and northern McMullen counties. Composed primarily of sands and
interbedded clays with a south-southeast dip toward the Gulf of Mexico, the Sparta
ranges from 100 to 300 feet in thickness. The aquifer is recharged by precipitation and

streams crossing the outcrop area. It has been calculated that about 5 percent of the
average annual precipitation received as recharge can be transmitted downdip (Muller
and Price 1979:53). This aquifer, although minor in comparison to the Carrizo-Wilcox,
has more importance in its effect on the study area due to surface water-related
characteristics.
The water-bearing formations within the study area transmit subsurface water
slowly toward the coast with few natural areas of discharge other than evaporation from
the soil or transpiration by plants. Artificial discharge, through the use of wells for public
supply, private irrigation, industrial use, and stock watering has resulted in significant
local drawdowns of the water level within the county (Tippett & Gee, Inc 1975:IX-21).
Early European-American visitors to the area frequently noted boggy conditions in
northern McMullen County and the southern section of Atascosa County (Inglis
1964:17, 18, 50-52). “Atascosa,” currently the name of a post office, a community, a
creek and a county, is thought to be a Mexican word derived from Spanish, meaning “a
muddy place” (Clover 1952:42-43). This meaning is no longer pertinent to the area but
was appropriate well into the 20th century. Clover, in 1952, interviewed informants who
gave eye witness accounts of bogs, quicksand, seep sands and artesian wells (Clover
1952:44-45). Accounts of Santa Ana’s 1836 crossing of Atascosa Creek and
Somervell’s 1842 expedition against Mexico contain multiple references to the boggy
impediments of the countryside (Clover 1952:46, Houston Telegraph and Texas
Register 1843; Brown 1892:231; Green 1935:52-58).
Comparison of these descriptions with present conditions show the past local
environment was potentially different in many respects, such as faunal and floral array,
water availability and land use capability and more hospitable to human habitation
under pre-industrial conditions.
The study area’s drainage pattern consists of dendritic intermittent streams
emptying into San Miguel Creek to the south and La Parita Creek to the north. San
Miguel Creek is a tributary of the Frio River while La Parita Creek flows into the
Atascosa River. The Frio, Atascosa and Nueces rivers join one another in neighboring
Live Oak County, at a point approximately 23 air miles southeast of the study area. It is
emphasized that at present the study area streams are primarily intermittent. Even San
Miguel Creek has experienced pooling during low recharge periods.
CLIMATE
Carr (1967:6) and Bomar (1983:220) place the study area within the Southern
Division of ten climatic divisions identified within Texas. An average regional annual
rainfall of 22.3 inches was experienced from 1931 to 1960 (Carr 1967:7) and 22.91
inches from 1951 to 1980 (Bomar 1983:220); the wettest months are May and
September. This comparatively dry climate territory lies within an area of mesothermal
temperatures having winter as the driest season and experiencing occasional desert
years (Russell 1945:43). The average annual temperature is 72º Fahrenheit, with usual
extreme temperatures reported in the high 90s and lower 40s. Freezing temperatures

Environmental Setting / 9
are rare. Annual mean relative humidity at 6 A.M. is close to 85%, decreasing to just
above 50% at 6 P.M. (Arbingast et al. 1976:19). Wind direction is principally from the
southeast and south-southeast, off the Gulf. These factors produce a long potential
growing season of about 290 days duration, limited more by water availability than by
temperature. The implications for aboriginal and pre-industrial human habitation are a
climate conducive to the support of deep-rooted or water-storing plant growth and those
fauna depending on such vegetation. Shelter requirements would not mandate
protection from extreme cold but must cope with periods of high humidity and
temperature.
Rainfall and evaporation rates, the former low (about 22 inches) and the latter
about 40 inches per annum, rapidly reduce ponded waters if underground recharge is
insufficient (see Hydrology, above), but this condition is modern. Earlier inhabitants of
the area would have had to cope with drought conditions less often.
SOILS
The study area soils are components of five major soil series: the Brundage,
Campbellton, Monteola, Fashing and Pettus. Their parent material, the unconsolidated
mass in which a soil forms, consisted mainly of sand, sandstone, shale, marl and
caliche of Tertiary and Quaternary age. The parent material, which determines the
chemical and mineralogical content of the soils and therefore affects the plant regime
supported, has weathered differentially to produce significantly different soils.
The Brundage soil series, which lies in narrow valleys along drainways, is a fine
sandy loam that formed in sediments presumed to be ancient alluvium. The Brundage is
characterized by weak, subangular blocky structure, a thin platy crust where exposed at
the surface, and a slightly acid to neutral tendency. It supports a fair range of native
vegetation (see Flora), but is not receptive to introduced domestic plant species due to
excess salts and sodium derived from parent material (Soil Conservation Service 1980).
The Brundage has a relatively high erosion factor rating, the results of which are readily
seen in the study area. It is host to more than a dozen recorded sites.
The Monteola and Fashing series soils are principally clays formed from
calcareous parent material. The former, the commonest within the study unit, is a deep,
moderately well-drained, upland soil of low slope (1-3%) (Soil Conservation Service
1980). It is, in its thick A horizon, very hard, firm, sticky and plastic with a very high
shrink-swell potential. Artifactual material deposited within it is likely to be
stratigraphically displaced by repeated soil expansion and contraction and the deep
cracking and subsequent infilling which accompanies it. The Fashing clays are shallow
coils formed over thick beds of shale in the uplands. The A horizon has a fine,
subangular, blocky structure, very hard, and tends toward moderate alkalinity and
salinity. It has a high shrink-swell potential and a moderately high erosion factor. The
shallow depth to bedrock, commonly 8 to 18 inches thick in the A horizon and 2 to 12
inches thick in the AC horizon, coupled with its erosion and shrink-swell characteristics,

10 / San Miguel Prospect
mediate against significant stratification of deposited cultural remains. The Monteola
and Fashing clays are host to the majority of the sites recorded within the study unit.
The Campbellton series consists of deep, well drained, upland loams with well
developed A, B, and C horizons and a significant clay component. The moderate shrinkswell characteristics of the Campbellton series, its depth, and medium erosion factor
rating make it a reasonable potential host for cultural remains in contrast to the
Brundage, Monteola and Fashing series soils. However, 41AT87 was the only site
recorded attributed to this soil on maps at the 1:24,000 scale. It is possible that upland
pockets of this soil too small to be recorded at that scale may harbor other sites
currently attributed to the surrounding Monteola clays and sites located near the
mapped junctions of these two soils series should be subjected to testing for such an
occurrence.
The Pettus loam is the final major soil series encountered within the study area.
The Pettus harbors only a single recorded site, 41AT83, within the surveyed area and is
the soil series of least areal extent found there. This soil is a shallow, well-drained loam
of low slope found in upland areas. Formed in calcareous loamy sediment, it contains
weakly cemented sandstone and shale strata in the typical pedon. Its chemical
composition, mineralogical content, location and depth contribute to a relatively low
erosion factor rating and its shrink-swell potential is low to very low. The Pettus offers
the possibility of low natural disturbance to deposited cultural remains but little depth or
areal extent to accommodate them.
FLORA
The relative proportion of plant species making up the vegetational mix in a given
area had a significant effect on the subsistence resources available to the preexploitation of the area. Variations in the vegetational mix through time can be expected
to produce variations in the behavior of the human population and therefore affect the
nature and extent of the cultural remnants of that population.
The Rio Grande Plain, commonly called the brasada or Brush Country, is south
of the Balcones Escarpment and southwest of the Guadalupe River. It is an area
currently characterized by mesquite, acacia, scrub oaks, numerous thorny bushes, cacti
and short grasses (See Appendix I). The area is well described by Water (1973:67-71)
as one in which grasses and woody species, as antagonistic plant types with respect to
root systems and their water economy, exist in a continuing state of disequilibrium.
Interference with the ecological conditions, either naturally or culturally induced, results
in advantages to either grasses or woody plants and the vegetational mix shifts toward
grass parkland at one end of the scale or toward a tree savannah at the other. The
factors which favor one set of species over the other are combined in effect to produce
a shrub savannah of constantly shifting plant proportions. These shifts are reflected in
the historic record.

Environmental Setting / 11
Alfonso de Leon passed very near the study area during his 1689 and 1690
expeditions to find the rumored French settlement in Spanish-claimed Texas. He noted
the presence of mesquite, the necessity for circumventing thickets, and boggy
conditions near the waterways (Inglis 1964:50).
In 1828, Jose Maria Sanchez, accompanying a Mexican expedition, commented
that “vegetation increased” between the Frio River and San Miguel Creek and that
“there were numerous small trees scattered everywhere.” Leaving the vicinity of the
present location of Cross (see Figure 1), where the expedition camped, he noted “the
ground covered with grass and small cacti that obstructed the traffic of our carriages a
great deal” (Inglis 1964:50).
By contrast, in 1842, Sterling Brown Hendricks with the Somervell Expedition has
that Texas military force marching “over hills and hollows through a wide and open
prairie” to a point on San Miguel Creek about eight miles due north of Tilden and
camping “in a beautiful island of timber in the prairie” (Inglis 1964:50). The study area is
only three miles distant from the area Hendricks described.
Bogusch (1952) has documented in detail the invasion of thorny brush species
into the Rio Grande Plain. That invasion’s results are described in Smith (1937:5) and
Dobie (1929:201-202, 1938:30-31). Farmers and ranchers tried to reduce the brush but
grazing livestock consumed the grass (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:531-540), favoring
the development of more brush (Walter 1973:71). Brush eradication disturbed the
surface and subsurface of many of the archeological sites in the region. Recognition of
this type of disturbance and the proper investigation of sites where it has occurred is
appropriately cited as a problem by Dusek (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:540) and must
be considered in the selection of sites meriting continued attention.
Hall, Black and Graves (1982:6) note the currently available data do not as yet
permit a reconstruction of plant communities at any given time in nearby Choke
Canyon’s prehistory. They comment that their results provide evidence that “mesquite,
acacia, and desert hackberry did not invade the area after some recent man-induced
environmental calamity” but have been in the region for at least 2,200 years (Hall, Black
and Graves 1982:525). Their report documents climatic changes in the area and, based
in part on biosilica analysis and carbonized botanical remains, begins to address the
paleobotanical environment of specific time periods (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:518530, 578-610). Presence having been established, at least during part of the area’s
history, the question is now one of proportions of species within the vegetational mix at
a given time in that history and correlating them with a human cultural stage. In the
current study area, a very few sites with undisturbed soils of significant depth offer an
opportunity to further investigate the nature of prehistoric vegetation in South Texas.

Atascosa and McMullen counties lie within the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. This
province, according to Blair (1952:249) has a greater diversity of faunal elements than

12 / San Miguel Prospect
any other in the state. Sixty-two mammalian species, thirty-six species of snakes,
salamanders and newts have been reported in recent times (Blair 1950:103). Added to
these are numerous birds (an estimated 545 species are native to Texas), continuously
resident and migratory, a large insect population and, where permanent water is
present, an important complement of fish and shellfish. For the prehistoric
hunter/gatherer population and for the frontier settlers, the province offered a huge
variety of usable animal species.
Larger mammals currently present are whitetailed deer peccary, jackrabbit,
coyote, opossum and armadillo. These along with bison, pronghorn antelope, black
bear, mountain lion, wolves and jaguar were present in the past (Texas Game, Fish and
Oyster Commission 1945:107; Doughty 1983:29, 212). For a limited period during the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, wild horses in immense numbers occupied the
area and were utilized as a food source by the native population and at least some of
the settlers (Doughty 1983:48-51).
Smaller mammals, several mouse species, shrews, moles, cottontail rabbits,
squirrels, gophers, ringtails, raccoon, coati, weasels and skunks are and were present
in considerable numbers. These undoubtedly were utilized in the subsistence scheme of
the prehistoric and settler population to the degree availability and habit allowed. The
faunal remains encountered during the Choke Canyon Reservoir excavations include
those of at least nine of the smaller mammal species (Hall, Black and Graves
1982:637).
Birds are represented in the archeological record for the area by at least six
identified species despite poor preservation conditions (Hall, Black and Graves
1982:637). The area is within the former range of the Attwater prairie chicken, the
seasonal range of the formerly vast flocks of Passenger pigeons and still harbors
significant numbers of wild turkeys (Doughty 1983:103-105; Texas Game, Fish and
Oyster Commission 1945:3, 15).
Fish, reptile, mussel and land snail are also present in the area’s recorded
archeological remains. Despite preservation difficulties, localization in proximity to
permanent water and small size, these remains are present in quantities sufficient to
postulate that these animal forms were heavily utilized by the aboriginal population. The
shells of land snails and mussels were the subsistence remains most commonly
recovered at Choke Canyon (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:i).
In summary, the present and past faunal complement of the Tamaulipan Biotic
Province offered a wide choice of subsistence sources to aboriginal and settler
populations. Animals were present in quantities such that a major portion of the human
diet could have been derived from them. But, the utilization of these resources required
more effort than was necessary to gather edible plants from the abundant vegetation
also present and diet may well have been skewed accordingly.

Environmental Setting / 13
LAND USE
Ranching in Atascosa and McMullen counties’ rural areas began to develop in
the 1870s in response to shipping points in the coastal cities and later in Kansas
(Everett 1981). It became profitable to trail drive cattle to these locations to supply
Eastern demands for beef. This was open range ranching with herds mingling until
separated by ownership during preparation for the drives. Only a few families lived on
their ranches. Most remained in the towns and communities and their effect on the
rangeland was minimal.
In the later 1870’s, a sheep and wool industry developed. With it came a
requirement for shepherds, shearers and a general support system for the industry. The
raw wool product, unlike cattle, did not go to market on the hoof. It was necessary to
house the people and build lambing pens, dig wells and, in general, to go to more
complicated ranchsteads. Families moved to the ranches, and small communities with
service facilities sprung up in areas where there was no established town. Major sheep
ranching ended by the 1980s, in part due to overgrazing. Cattle ranching, which never
really ceased, resumed the major industry role. But, by that time, extensions of the
railroad had made cattle drives of major scope obsolete. Ranchers not already living on
their ranges relocated to them, and fences made possible by the invention and
distribution of barbed wire began to appear. Cattle ranching on an individual basis
supplanted open range ranching and resulted in an increased rural population living on
ranch complexes with a larger number of buildings and facilities. Cattle ranching
remains the chief industry of the area.
Once settled on their ranches, owners and hired help raised subsistence crops in
relatively small cultivated areas and cleared pasture near their homes but most property
was affected only by brush removal or suppression and by stock overgrazing. In the
study area, the effects of shallow garden plowing and pasture clearing are apparent on
a small scale.
Other minor land alterations within the study area resulted from oil and gas
discoveries in the early 1900s and intensive production in the 1920s. A few oil
exploration holes and well pads, some with tanks, are evident but the actual area
affected is minute.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The culture-history sequence of the Lower Gulf Coastal Plain of South Texas and
Atascosa and McMullen counties can be divided into four broad cultural periods: the
Paleoindian (ca. 9000 B.C. to 6000 B.C.), the Archaic (6000 B.C. to A.D. 1200), the
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1528) and Historic (A.D. 1528 to present) (Hester
1980). These have been defined on the basis of subsistence strategies, artifacts and
geographic associations. The Historic period, additionally, is defined by the keeping of
written records.
The Paleoindian Period began with the arrival of North America’s first inhabitants,
who spread rapidly to all ice-free regions of the continent. These people practiced nonspecialized gathering strategies and the hunting of Pleistocene megafauna such as
mammoth and mastodon (Hester 1976b:3-4; Shafer and Baxter 1975:11). Major timediagnostic Paleoindian artifacts are stone tools, notably Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff,
Plainview, Meserve and San Patrice projectile point types. Paleoindian activity in the
project area is reflected by the relative abundance of characteristic projectile point types
in private collections, especially from along San Miguel Creek (Hester 1968).
By 6000 B.C., subsistence strategies had become regionalized and based on
diversified hunting and gathering; these changes define the Archaic Period. In South
Texas, two major Archaic cultural specializations are recognized, an inland savannah
and a coastal maritime adaptation (Hester 1971:5; 1976a). Archaic Period traits include
several diagnostic lithic assemblages and cultural features such as hearths, burials,
pits, middens and burned rock concentrations.
The Archaic ended about A.D. 1200 with the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
Period, defined by technological innovations and possibly a shift in emphasis toward
hunting within the context of a hunting-gathering economy. Principally, these
innovations were the adoption of the bow and arrow, new lithic tool forms and the use of
pottery. Late Prehistoric pottery in interior south Texas was a bone-tempered plainware;
coastal pottery. Rockport Ware also contained bone temper but varieties were
decorated with ochre and asphaltum.
The Historic period began in A.D. 1528 with Cabeza de Vaca’s transit of South
Texas. Indians of the Coahuiltecan linguistic group lived in the region and were divided
into hundreds of discrete bands (Campbell and Campbell 1981). They pursued ways of
life, persisting from the Archaic through the Late Prehistoric, that were semi-nomadic,
inhabiting temporary villages usually located near streams, and employing hunting and
gathering subsistence strategies. They were patrilineal and patrilocal, with inheritance
through the male line. Their society was egalitarian, in which social status was earned
rather than inherited (Lynn, Fox and O’Malley 1977: Table 3, 28-29). In the upper
15

16 / San Miguel Prospect
coastal area of the region, the territories of the Karankawas and Tonkawas bordered
that of the Coahuiltecans.
One of the better recorded South Texas Coahuiltecan groups, the Mariames,
ranged in this cultural border zone along the Guadalupe River during the fall, winter and
spring. They are reported by Campbell (1938:351) to have migrated in the summer as
far as 80 miles southwestward to tracts of fruit-bearing prickly pear cactus in the regions
west of Corpus Christi Bay. This seasonal territory lay near the present project area.
The Guadalupe River region and the inland plain constituted the two poles of the
Mariame’s bipolar seasonal territory. The project area also lies centrally within
Campbell’s (1983:353, 356) Area 3, peopled by less well-defined groups, such as the
Pampopas and Aguastayas, who ranged between lands along the upper half of the San
Antonio River and as far as 100 miles southward, along the two great bends of the
Nueces River.
The Historic Stage was one of stress and displacement of the Coahuiltecans,
who were profoundly affected by the colonizing and missionizing Spanish from the
south and by the raiding Lipan Apaches from the north (Newcomb 1961). The result
was the eventual disappearance of the long-standing aboriginal cultures of South
Texas.
PREVIOUS WORK
South Texas and Atascosa and McMullen counties comprise a rich archeological
zone; before the current survey, 74 sites had been recorded in Atascosa County, most
of these on the San Miguel Lignite Prospect, and 340 sites were located in McMullen
County. Shafer’s and Baxter’s (1975) study constitutes the major cultural resource
inventory in Atascosa County. Examples of all their site types, multiple function, limited
function, and resource procurement sites, were found in all their defined physiographic
zones: stream valleys, valley-upland margins and uplands. Follow-up mitigation by
Usrey, Grysinski and Bond (1978) and Usrey (1980) consisted of controlled surface
collections on nine sites in the uplands of the original project area. On the basis of point
typology, the archeologists assigned the heavily deflated sites to the Paleoindian and
the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. Another notable effort in the county
was McGraw’s (1979b), who reported four lithic scatter sides distributed from the flood
plains to the uplands and one occupation site located on a stream divide upland.
A large proportion of the sites in McMullen County were recorded by the Choke
Canyon Reservoir investigations. More than 400 sites dating from Paleoindian through
Historic times have now been recorded and investigated in this Frio River Valley
reservoir in Live Oak and McMullen counties (Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Lynn, Fox
and O’Malley 1977; Sorrow, O’Malley and Fox 1974). Small scale projects in upland
zones above the river valleys are beginning to give a wider cultural and environmental
picture of the prehistoric period (Dusek 1980; Robinson 1980), as are studies of surface
collections (Hemion 1979; Hester 1968). Many of these efforts have been reported over
the years in La Tierra, the Journal of the South Texas Archaeological Association.

Archeological Background / 17

Counties surrounding Atascosa and McMullen counties show varying amounts of
archeological research. To the north and east, the Bexar County site inventory exceeds
700 and is rapidly increasing in response to urbanization (TARL files). One of their most
famous is the Alamo, a site whose significance transcends the merely historical. Bexar
County contains metropolitan San Antonio, and two factors account for the high number
of recorded sites: 1) San Antonio has been an important center throughout the historic
period, thus creating many significant sites, and 2) San Antonio’s urban growth has
resulted in numerous archeological investigations – mandated, voluntary or accidental.
The University of Texas at San Antonio, Center for Archeological Research (CAR) has
led Bexar County research.
At the time of this survey, Wilson County held 74 recorded sites (TARL files).
Fifty-five of these sites were identified by Hsu and Ralph (1968) during the Cibolo Creek
Reservoir Project. Primarily prehistoric, the site also largely consisted of lithic scatters
lacking in temporally or culturally diagnostic artifacts. Subsequently, UTSA-CAR
excavated 41WN73, a burial and occupation site, for the State Department of Highways
and Public Transportation.
Eighty-six sites had been recorded in Karnes County (TARL files). A major
research project was conducted in the Ecleto Creek watershed by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project and Prewitt and Associates, Inc.; 16 prehistoric and one
historic site were investigated (Crawford 1971; Kotter and Guy 1980). The Conquista
Project cultural resources inventory in Karnes County recorded four prehistoric sites and
isolated cultural material (McGraw 1979a; Roemer 1980). Survey of the TexacoSunedco Hobson Uranium Prospect in western Karnes County yielded two isolated
finds and one site. The observed site inventory included twelve flakes, one stone core,
one core toll and one dart point medial fragment; none of these artifacts were temporally
or culturally diagnostic (Nightengale and Bement 1982).
To the east of Atascosa and McMullen counties, Live Oak County has
contributed immensely to current knowledge of South Texas prehistory. Two hundred
seventy-three sites have been recorded there (TARL files), but organized research in
Live Oak County has taken place over a comparatively short span of time, beginning
with W.H. Wakefield’s 1967 survey of 18 archeological sites in the proposed Choke
Canyon Reservoir (Wakefield 1968). The initial work by the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project, The University of Texas at Austin, was followed by a survey and
excavation by the Texas Historical Commission and the Center for Archeological
Research The University of Texas at San Antonio. Results have been summarized in
the McMullen County discussion; this research project has laid the groundwork for
future archeological research in South Texas (Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Lynn, Fox
and O’Malley 1977; Sorrow, O’Malley and Fox 1974).
In 1977 and 1978, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
excavated a site of major importance in the Atascosa River flood plain/terrace margin
north of the town of Three Rivers. Site 41LK28 is a cemetery site which contained more

18 / San Miguel Prospect
than 160 prehistoric burials and artifacts datable to the Paleoindian, Archaic and Late
Prehistoric stages. Continuing site and artifact analysis is expected to shed light on
Archaic lifeways, burial patterns and interaction between the Central Texas and South
Texas culture regions (Hester 1981:123-124).
The Texas Archeological Survey initiated archeological assessments in the
Three Rivers Flood Protection Project in 1975. The project was situated on the Frio
River flood plain at Three Rivers, and investigations recorded 16 prehistoric and three
historic sites or components. Analysis of the prehistoric sites demonstrated functional
variations between them with overall emphasis on mussel collecting and lithic resource
procurement (Mallouf 1975; Prewitt and Scott 1977; Dibble 1979; Pliska 1980).
Small-scale research projects in the county have contributed to prehistoric
reconstruction. Creel et al. (1979) excavated 41LK106, a site on Sulphur Creek in
Western Live Oak County. Artifacts suggested site occupations at various times from
the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. In a survey for the Conquista Project,
McGraw (1979b) found two sites in the upland stream divide physiographic setting; one
site is classified as a light lithic scatter, the other little more than a rock hearth. Survey
and testing at 41LK117 on an alluvial terrace and adjacent upland above Sulphur Creek
defined Early, Middle and Late Archaic occupations (Smith 1978). Recent investigations
by the Texas Archeological Survey have found similar upland site types and patterning
(Robinson 1983a, 1983b).
To the south of McMullen County, Duval County lies in the heart of the brasada,
the South Texas brush country. Forty-three sites have been recorded there (TARL files).
Site patterns show similarities to McMullen County sites.
Westward from Atascosa and McMullen counties, in higher elevations and
progressively drier climate, 83 sites have been recorded in Webb County, 21 sites in
LaSalle County, and 22 sites in Frio County (TARL files). The Frio County inventory was
largely the result of surveys by the State Department of Highways and Transportation
while the LaSalle County sites were all reported by avocationalists. Webb County
cultural chronology extends back to Clovis times in the Paleoindian Period. Nunley
(1971) conducted the most extensive study in the region, in the lowlands along the Rio
Grande from Falcon Dam to Laredo. He examined materials from 50 Archaic sites,
seeking to determine sociocultural units. Nunley perceived five such units, determined
primarily on the basis of artifact and assemblage styles and said to have had territorial
restrictions. Gibson (1981) surveyed an upland area in southeastern Webb County and
found 12 sites, classified functionally as two cobble-acquisition locations, four flintworking sites, two field camps, one hunting camp and three residential base camps.
Kenmotsu and Nightengale (1980) found two sites in the highest elevations in the
county, one (41WB79) a lithic scatter, the other (41WB80) an artifact scatter with stone
tools. The tools included a Tortugas point and a Perdiz point.
The foregoing discussions have presented a picture of current anthropological
research in the Atascosa and McMullen area of South Texas. A detailed and incisive

Archeological Background / 19
summary of South Texas archeological research, compiled by Carol Graves, can be
found in Hall, Black and Graves (1982:7-25).
The Project Area
The proposed project area in Atascosa and McMullen counties includes zones
investigated by Shafer and Baxter (1975) on portions of the Caballos Creek, Crowther,
Cross and Cross NE USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Fig. 1). All currently
recorded sites on these quadrangles were discovered by Shafer’s and Baxter’s (1975)
cultural resource investigations of the lignite prospect and the associated San Miguel
Transmission Line.
Usrey, Grysinski and Bond (1978) conducted follow-up mitigation of two upland
sites, 41AT22 and 41AT24, in the original prospect. Additional mitigation by Usrey
(1980) at seven more sites originally found by Shafer and Baxter (1975) yielded
Paleoindian material, along with evidence of Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric
occupations. Both mitigation efforts applied a method of mapping and systematic
surface collection. Findings demonstrated advanced deflation and shallow or no
subsurface cultural deposits in the uplands. Eight of the mitigated sites may be classed
as multifunctional.
Within the present extended permit area, Shafer and Baxter recorded sites
41MC101-108, 41MC124 and 41MC125. Sites 41MC103 and 41MC106 received
management recommendations for surface collection, the only sites evaluated as
meriting further work. These recommendations have not been implemented and the
results of the original San Miguel Prospect work and similar studies in Choke Canyon
suggests that the value of systematic surface collecting should be reviewed at these
sites. No sites in the permit area or vicinity have been determined eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places.
Shafer’s and Baxter’s study provided a practical foundation for site typologies
and physiographic zones used in the present study. Most of the sites are lithic scatters
belonging to the limited function and lithic resource procurement site types in Shafer’s
and Baxter’s site classifications. The lithic scatters, large and small, were frequently
found on stream divide uplands, but they also were encountered on stream terrace
lowlands and valley/upland margins. More complex multiple function sites, or habitation
sites, were found most frequently on stream terrace lowlands. Thus, sites were
expected in all microenvironments in the proposed survey area, but the more complex
sites would be in the stream terrace lowlands, especially those alongside La Jarita, Hog,
Caballos and Salt Branch creeks. Furthermore, considering environmental factors,
upland sites were expected to be deflated and lacking in subsurface contexts. On the
other hand, stream terrace sites held some potential for burial, possibly stratified by
alluvial creek deposits. These factors are relevant to the determination of site
significance in the proposed project area.

Summary
The cultural past of South Texas has been shown as a time of appearance of
hunting and gathering cultures and their continuation late into the Historic period. Less
complex than other cultures, hunters and gatherers correspondingly adapt and respond
closely to the environment and its changes. Consequently, these cultures achieve
stable economies and populations, at a cost of unrelenting nomadism and strict
population control.
Current knowledge of South Texas history and prehistory justifies its subdivision
into four cultural periods, the Paleoindian (ca. 9,000 B.C. – 6,000 B.C.), the Archaic
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 1,200) the Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1,200 – 1528) and the Historic
(1528 to present). The long periods of time spanned by these stages reflect two relevant
points: 1) the long-term resilience and adaptability of hunter-gatherer cultures, and 2)
the inability of current research to discern finer prehistoric distinctions and changes,
both as a result of the inherent paucity of hunter-gatherer remains and the lack of
preservation of datable materials. The latter point identifies a clear area for continuing
research: chronology. South Texas time periods rely heavily on stylistic cross-dating
with other regions. Radiocarbon assays have supported this basic framework, but the
continuing identification, retrieval and C-14 dating of organic specimens from stratified
sites persist as important regional research goals.
Four models of South Texas hunter-gatherer settlement patterns have emerged
from the current research. Cultural resource surveys have amassed site data and
continuing interest in prehistoric settlement patterns. Three models, Hester’s (1971,
1976b, 1981), Shafer’s and Baxter’s (1975) and Lynn’s, Fox’s and O’Malley’s (1977)
derive from this interest. The fourth model, Campbell’s (1983), has been advanced from
ethnohistoric sources.
Hester (1971, 1976b, 1981) describes settlement as a heterogeneous distribution
of sites. A coastal maritime adaptation and an inland savannah adaptation have been
identified as two basic categories of economy and settlement. Diversity in the savannah
pattern is found in a dichotomy of site size and location. Large base camps were
established in lowland stream terrace, high density resource areas. From these base
camps, labor groups exploited the terrace and upland low density resource areas,
establishing satellite foraging and hunting sites of small size and short duration. The
exact nature and functioning of both site types in this base-satellite model may vary
locally with specific food resources and differences in seasonal availability (Hester
1981:126).
Shafer and Baxter (1975) tested Hester’s (1971) formulation for Zavala County,
comparing the functions of the prospect’s sites to the physiographic zones in which the
sites were located. They found that large base campsites cross-cut all physiographic
zones, lowland and upland, as do small, limited function sites. With these contrary
findings, Shafer and Baxter (1975:73) proposed their model for settlement limited strictly
by water availability. By this water model, the variables of resources and physiographic

Archeological Background / 21
zones are subsumed by water and its seasonal fluctuations, which together comprise
the prime, overarching factor in site establishment and occupation. Prehistoric people
would therefore establish sites anywhere water sources allowed, regardless of
physiographic zone.
Lynn, Fox and O’Malley (1977:220) responded to their own Choke Canyon Reservoir
site data, especially extended lowland strip sites, in advancing their linear site model.
This model may be considered a variant of Hester’s ideas in that necessary food
resources again come to the fore in dominating site location choices. According to the
linear site model, aboriginals focused on an abundant resource or multiple resources
conjoined in lowland high density resource areas, and did not focus on any specific site
location. The consequent inspecific, generalized idea of site location and reuse year
after year resulted in the spread of sites linearly over time along stream courses.
The ethnohistoric model has been offered by Campbell (1983:351, 353, 356),
and this model comes closest to providing details about the yearly nomadic round of
Campbell’s defined areas, 3 and 4. The Mariames migrated within Area 4, from winter
grounds along the Guadalupe River to summer prickly pear tracts west of Corpus Christi
Bay. Area 3 groups such as the Pampopas and Aguastayas migrated between the San
Antonio and Nueces rivers, directly through the project area. The differences in winter
and summer camps, albeit poorly described apart from the Mariames, and the large
geographic scale of nomadic movements suggest that most, if not all, South Texas
groups may have pursued bipolar winter-summer yearly subsistence rounds, at least in
the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods.
HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The historic era, commencing with the first recorded accounts of the area, begins for
northern McMullen County/southern Atascosa County with the seventeenth century
passage of a Spanish expedition led by Alonso de Leon. In 1689 and again in 1690, de
Leon traversed the northern edge of McMullen County and portions of southern
Atascosa County en route to East Texas in support of Spanish interests there. Camping
at least twice in the vicinity of present-day Cross and repeatedly using San Miguel
Creek to direct the line of march, de Leon recorded a few comments on the topography,
flora and fauna which were encountered (Castañeda 1936:V 1, 333-338; Bolton
1916:284). These meager route of march notes for the area are the entire record until
1778, when Fray Juan Augustin Morfi, chaplain of the Croix Expedition, describes
crossing Little San Miguel Creek and the Frio River on the way back to the Rio Grande
from San Antonio de Bexar (Weddle and Thonhoff 1976:137), a chronicle of a journey
which must have been one of many along the same general route. This route, a San
Antonio-Laredo Road, passed some 15 miles west of the study area, a distance
sufficient to safely rule out the presence of its Spanish users and the possibility of
resulting cultural remains.
In the nineteenth century (1828), Irish empresarios James McGloin and John
McMullen received Mexican contracts to colonize a territory which included portions of

22 / San Miguel Prospect
Atascosa, Bexar, Bee, Frio, LaSalle, Live Oak, McMullen, Medina, San Patricio and
Wilson counties. The settlers subsequently brought by the empresarios did not settle in
or near the study area. Only two grants were made in McMullen County and neither was
occupied (McMullen County Deed Records:V 1, 193-196; General Land Office 1942:V
4, 693; Lauderdale and Doak 1936:1-11). The study area and the whole of the county
continued unsettled until well into the 1850’s. The Laredo Road continued in use but
with no established way station within the “Brush Country.” Records of passage exist for
Jose Maria Sanchez in 1828, William Bollaert in 1843; and Nathaniel Michler in 1848
(Inglis 1964:50-51). No mention of habitation is made in any of these accounts with
Hendricks, Bollaert and Michler all commenting on the absence of settlement (Everett
1981:6).
Settlement finally came to the general area in 1858 as the frontier advanced to fill
the area between Laredo, Corpus Christi and San Patricio to the south and San
Antonio, New Braunfels, Fredericksburg and Castroville to the north. Tilden (originally
Rio Frio), a dozen miles south-southwest of the study area, and Yarbrough Bend, ten
miles east of Tilden, were the first communities established in McMullen County. The
county was created out of parts of Atascosa, Bexar and Live Oak counties on February
1, 1858 by an act of the Texas Legislature, but no provision was made to organize the
political division created (Smyer 1952:65).
By 1860, the county had an estimated population of 100 inhabitants, most of
them located in the settlements at Yarbrough Bend and Rio Frio. By 1870, census
figures show 39 families comprising 230 persons within the county boundaries (U.S.
Department of the Interior 1870), about 190 of whom lived in or near Rio Frio which had
been renamed Dog Town (Smyer 1952:80).
Throughout the 1860’s and early 1870’s, attempts were made to organize the
county but a sufficient number of voters (150) could not be attained until late in 1876.
Organization succeeded in early 1877 with a county seat established at Dog Town. The
town had been officially renamed Calfax in 1871, but its citizens continued to call it Dog
Town right up to 1877, when the current name, Tilden, was adopted in honor of
presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden (Smyer 1952:43, 116, 119).
Population and settlement spread, advanced and declined slowly in the general
area throughout the rest of the nineteenth century. Peak population for the county was
1.038 in 1890, with a drop to 1.024 in 1900. Both figures exceed the present census of
789 in 1980. They reflect an economy based on cattle ranching with occasional shifts to
mineral mining and oil and gas production (Belo Corporation 1984:246, 345). The study
area has never been populous; even today it has only a handful of property owners.
Nevertheless, McMullen County can claim the highest per capita incidence of State
Historical Markers of any county in Texas. Eight, including markers for the community,
buildings and graves were noted within Tilden and two more, marking the Franklin
Ranch and Cross community on State Highway 16, are near the study area. Residents
of the county display and act on their interest in the area’s historic resources.

Archeological Background / 23
Private ownership and occupation of the study area begin in June, 1884 with the
acquisition of the property by Frank Burmeister, born Frederick Herman Franz
Burmeister (McMullen County Deed Records; Book E, 33-1332). The one historic
component recorded in the study area (41MC102) is the remains of the Burmeister
home, built by this prominent McMullen County legislator in 1902. The family history, as
related by Gustave Burmeister (1984), and his description of Life on lajarita are detailed
in the concluding chapter of this report. It is probable that the area was used only as a
source of maverick cattle and wild horses prior to its sale to Burmeister.

METHODS
Prior to the inception of field work, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) site files and appropriate USGS topographic maps for Atascosa and McMullen
counties were examined as part of a literature search for the sponsor (Robinson 1985)
to ascertain:
1. physiographic location and kinds of sites in the counties and region;
2. the locations of any historic or prehistoric sites recorded in the study area; and
3. the extent of recent research in the study area and the region.
Ten prehistoric sites had been recorded in the study area as part of a previous survey in
1974 (Shafer and Baxter 1975). The Texas Historical Commission’s National Register of
Historic Places files were also examined to determine if known sites might be
endangered by mining activities. No nominations to that register were located in the
project area or on the periphery.
The numerous landowners were contacted by personnel of the San Miguel
Lignite Co-op for permission to survey their property. These same landowners were
interviewed by the survey crew for information about area history, the location of known
prehistoric sites and their private collections of artifacts from the prospect.
Maps of the study area, supplied by the sponsor and TAS, included a 1″=500′
topographic map, 1″=500′ aerials, and USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles. In
addition, USDA aerial photographs (Texas Natural Resource Information Service 1946)
were helpful in determining land use and settlement changes over the past 39 years.
Prior to walking the land, all maps were examined for the locations of property lines and
for the most efficient survey routes. Survey technique varied with the terrain. The most
generally used procedure was to take bearings on fencelines, align the crew
perpendicular to the fenceline at 30 meter intervals, and then walk the length and width
of the property. Each surveyor walked a zigzag pattern to increase the area scanned.
Along drainages, surveyors paralleled the creek on each side in order to observe
cutbanks and terraces. Ground visibility was limited in some cases by dense brush or
thick grasses in the improved pastures. Natural erosion, gullying, sheetwash and bank
slump had both exposed and destroyed numerous sites.
At prehistoric sites, shovel probes were dug to ascertain the extent and depth of
subsurface cultural deposits and to assess the nature of the soils. The contents of each
probe were screened through ¼″ hardware cloth, recorded by level, and probe locations
plotted on the site map.

A sample of surface-exposed artifacts were collected and analyzed according to
the classificatory system established by Hall, Black and Graves (1982) at Choke
Canyon. The density and distribution of non-diagnostic material was noted on the forms
and plotted on site maps. All lithic artifacts are chert unless otherwise noted. All
specimens, photographs and other documentation are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
All sites were plotted on topographic and aerial maps, photographed and
recorded on State of Texas archeological site data forms. Sites were assigned
permanent site numbers in the trinomial numbering system, i.e., 41 = Texas, AT =
Atascosa County, 12 = number of site found within the county. Thus, for example,
41AT75 is the 75th site recorded in Atascosa County, Texas.
HISTORIC METHODS
Archival research was conducted using the files of the Commissioner’s Courts
and County Clerks of McMullen and Atascosa counties, the Land Office of the State of
Texas, the Barker History Center at the University of Texas, the library at Tilden and the
map and imagery holdings of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS)
at Austin.
Field investigation of the one historic site in the study area was directed to
architectural detail, materials used, methods of construction employed and the presence
of diagnostic artifacts. Only 41MC102 qualified for site recording: one other vacant
house within the study was verifiably less than 50 years old (TNRIS 1946) and is
otherwise undistinguished according to recording criteria.
Oral history notes were taken by the crew chief as the opportunity presented
itself. The majority of the Prospect residents are post-World War II settlers but they
were able to direct us to Gustave “Butch” Burmeister, son of Frank Burmeister, first
resident landowner in the Prospect. Mr. Burmeister’s book, Life on Iajarita, and his
photographic collection are a major source of information on 41MC102 and the
Prospect in general in the early twentieth century.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The 41 newly recorded and eight reassessed sites in the San Miguel Prospect
are described in narrative form. Their pertinent characteristics are tabulated for ease of
reference (Table 1). The one historic component is included within the larger prehistoric
site, 41MC102.
ATASCOSA COUNTY
41AT75
Situated on the southwest lobe of an upland divide, 41AT75 encompasses a
36,000 square meter area between two southwest-flowing header tributaries of Hog and
La Jarita creeks, approximately 3 kilometers from these streams. Vegetation varies from
mesquite savannah on the flats to thorny brush chaparral on the slopes. The former is
characterized by mesquite, agarita and cacti with open areas of clump grass and forbes,
whereas the latter is covered with dense blackbrush. The shallow clay soils of the
Fashing clay series prevail on both slopes and level areas. Based on profiles exposed
in gullies, depth of clay over the substrate is approximately 5 to 10 centimeters. No
shovel probes were attempted because of the shallow, dense nature of the soils.
Underlying the clays are sandstones and shales of the Jackson Group. Undivided
caliche covered shales are exposed in the numerous shallow gullies that cut the slopes;
tabular sandstone outcrops are observed on the mid-and toe slope where sheetwash
and gullies have swept away the topsoil.
Small quantities of chert, chalcedony and petrified wood are exposed over most
of the site area. The more abundant chert gravels range from 5 to 10 centimeters in
length; chalcedony varies from small globular to tabular pieces 1 to 5 centimeters in
maximum dimension. The petrified wood (palmwood) is also small, 5 to 10 centimeter
chunks. Prehistoric utilization of these lithic resources is apparent in the artifact
assemblage. Although chert flakes, tools and cores predominate, palmwood and
chalcedony flakes and cores are also present. The palmwood debris is confined to
cores and flakes; no tools or projectile points of this material were found at the site. The
majority of the palmwood debitage has been thermally altered, a characteristic of the
lithic assemblage at several upland sites in the area, first observed by Shafer and
Baxter (1975). Unlike the other sites where chalcedony is usually found as finished
tools, at 41AT75 this raw material is only present in flake form.
Cultural material is scattered over most of the site area. The majority is apparent
on the east and west crests as well as in the erosional gullies. The gullies have exposed
and redeposited cultural debris from the crests and mid-slopes. Included are tools such
as scrapers, gouges and utilized flakes; early stage bifaces and dart points (Refugio),
27

Site Descriptions / 29

30 / San Miguel Prospect
primary, secondary and tertiary flakes exhibiting both hard and soft hammer percussion,
cores, ground stone and small amounts of burned rock. Burned rock is the least
abundant cultural residue observed at the site. The varied artifact assemblage suggests
this site served as a locus for a number of interrelated activities. Exploitation of lithic
resources, vegetation and game are suggested by the presence of workable gravels,
ground stone, scrapers, gouges, utilized flakes and projectile points. Although the tool
kit is as diverse as those found at sites along the primary waterways of the study area,
the smaller site size suggests a more limited Archaic occupation.
41AT76
This small campsite occupies 600 square meters of upland divide between two
header tributaries: the eastern drainway flows south-southeast to form Salt Branch. The
other, to the west, flows southwest into La Jarita Creek. Vegetation is characteristic of
the upland divide flats, where open areas of clump grasses, forbes and cacti are broken
by stands of mesquite, black brush and Texas persimmon. Soils consist of shallow,
somewhat calcareous clays of the Fashing series (Soil Conservation Service 1980). At
the time of site recording, the dry surface was obviously cracked over much of the area.
Shovel probes to a depth of 15 centimeters produced only two pieces of burned rock.
Surficial material is equally sparse; six secondary and tertiary chert flakes and one
piece of burned rock were found in isolated contexts. Based on the minimal cultural
debris, the site appears to have been a short-term, upland camp, quite possibly a
hunting camp. No temporal or functional diagnostics were recovered at the site proper.
An isolated lanceolate basal fragment, snapped at mid-blade, was found on the slopes
150 meters west of the site; it is of Paleoindian age, but its association with the site is
tenuous at best.
41AT77
41AT77 occupies a 90,000 square meter area on the western margins of an
upland lobe between two southwest-flowing primary tributaries of Hog Creek.
Vegetation varies from mesquite savannah on the upper flats to thorny brush chaparral
on the lower slopes. Moderately deep, calcareous shrink/swell clays of the Monteola
series (Soil Conservation Service 1980) overlie interbedded sandstone and shale
substrates of the Jackson Group Undivided (Barnes 1976). Sheetwash and gullying
have exposed caliche covered substrates along the lower western slopes of the site.
Blackbrush vegetation still retains about 5 centimeters of soil in several areas.
Erosion has apparently exposed artifacts from numerous encampments on a
common surface. A dense scatter of burned rock, flakes, early stage bifaces, tools such
as gouges, scrapers and choppers, utilized flakes, cores and some mussel shell were
observed in this eroded context. Some redeposition from higher on the slope is reflected
in the accumulations along the toe slopes; in places, where vegetation has retained the
soils, many artifacts lie perpendicular to the surface. Lithic raw material, including
pebble sized chert gravels, chalcedony and purple quartzite, although limited and
dispersed, was apparently acquired at the site or further up the divide. Flakes are

Site Descriptions / 31
predominantly secondary and tertiary chert, though several primary flakes were also
noted on the surface. Unifaces found at this site, and elsewhere in the project area, are
manufactured from primary flakes with sheared bulbs of percussion, the result of a split
cobble technique.
Temporal indicators such as Archaic (Pedernales-like and Frio) dart points,
Scallorn arrow points and Nueces tools suggest a favored locus for groups during the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric. In summary, it is apparent that artifacts from several
thousand years of occupation have been redeposited onto a common surface, in most
cases caliche pan. Since the site lies adjacent to the study area boundary, it is possible
that it extends onto unsurveyed property.
41AT78
Situated on the slopes of an upland margin, 41AT78 occupies a 6600 square
meter area approximately 200 meters north of 41AT77 and about 100 meters east of a
primary tributary of Hog Creek. Several campsites of varying size and elevation are
located along this same tributary: 41AT77, 41AT78, 41AT79 and 41AT81. With the
exception of 41AT81, all of the sites lie along the upland margins. Vegetation at 41AT78
is mostly mesquite savannah with prickly pear and clump grasses. Mesquite trees on
the site are larger than usual, 6-7 meters in height. Scattered areas are dominated by
throny blackbrush. Soils are calcareous, shrink/swell clays of the Monteola series (Soil
Conservation Service 1980). At the time of recording, these soils had begun to crack
and shrink, but gullying has not yet been severe enough to expose underlying
sandstones and shales. Primary disturbances at this site are sheetwash and ant hills.
A small quantity of chert flakes (10-15), a few tools (3) and 10-15 pieces of
burned rock are thinly scattered over the surface of the site. No apparent concentrations
of material were observed. Two subsurface probes failed to yield artifacts near what can
be termed site center. Although post-depositional disturbance from runoff, ants and soil
dynamics have greatly altered the original context of the site, the density and diversity of
cultural materials are much more limited than at the other sites on this tributary.
Domestic functions are implied by the burned rock and tools, and tool manufacture or
maintenance by the flakes, but no occupational periods can be established from
artifacts observed or collected from the site area. Given its proximity to larger sites to
the northeast and southwest (41AT77 and 41AT79, respectively), 41AT78 seems
subsidiary to these major occupational areas.
41AT79
41AT79 is located approximately 200 meters north of 41AT78, on the opposite
side of the same southwest flowing primary tributary of Hog Creek. The site covers
37,500 square meters on the southwest slope of an upland margin. A small portion of
the site extends up onto the lobe of a southwest exposure of the upland divide. Here as
well as on the slopes, vegetation is moderately open savannah with motts of mesquite
and blackbrush. Less prickly pear was observed at the site than at others in the area.

32 / San Miguel Prospect
Vegetation also includes tasajillo, Jerusalem thorn, agarita and scattered high clump
grasses and forbes. Calcareous, shrink/swell Monteola clays (Soil Conservation Service
1980) underlie the vegetation on both slopes and divide. In July at the time of site
recording, these soils had begun to dry and crack. Observations of the same soils later
in the month showed cracks 3 centimeters wide to 30 centimeters below the surface.
This and subsequent runoff and erosion are responsible for the heavy redeposition at
this and other sites in the area. Artifacts at 41AT79 were observed thinly scattered over
the surface. Sheetwash exposures contained the majority of the cultural debris. It
appears that a 100 meter-wide swath of vegetation has been cleared from the
southwest slopes, extending approximately 150 meters down slope from near the 350′
elevation line.
A light scatter of chert secondary and tertiary flakes, as well as a tertiary flake of
opalized wood were interspersed with two bifaces, four or five cores, one to three
unifaces, and burned rock. Although the majority of material lay along the southsouthwest crest and mid-slopes, no concentrations were observed. Based on the type
and quantity of material, the site appears to have been a procurement locality for lithics
and game. The presence of one untyped dart point indicates general Archaic Period
occupation(s).
41AT80
Spatially, this site occupies a 37,100 square meter area atop the upland divide
between two major drainage basins, the Atascosa/La Parita and the San Miguel/La
Jarita. Although extensive, the cultural material is sparsely scattered over an area that
lies approximately 400 meters west of a primary headwater tributary of Caballos Creek
and 300 meters north of a primary headwater tributary of Hog Creek. Several sites lie
along the margins of both these header tributaries.
The vegetation is moderately open mesquite savannah. Scattered, large
mesquite trees and black brush dot open stretches of clump grasses and forbes. Prickly
pear, tasajillo and agarita are also present. Calcareous Monteola clays (Soil
Conservation Service 1980) are exposed over much of the upland surface. Shrink/swell
cracks were beginning to form at the time of site recording. Caliche covered shale and
sandstone are exposed along the northeast slopes. It is here that small accumulations
of cultural material are most visible; chert and palmwood flakes and burned rock are
lightly scattered over the exposed substrates, material evidence for centuries of
redeposition. Artifacts observed atop the divide include chert and palmwood flakes and
burned rock, averaging one flake and burned rock fragment every 20 square meters.
Interspersed are several unifaces, bifaces (1 gouge and 1 finished fragment), cores and
two ground stone fragments. Although prehistoric subsistence procurement and
processing are suggested by the array of artifacts, the period of occupation can not be
estimated.

Site Descriptions / 33
41AT81
This very small campsite occupies a 1600 square meter area on the southern
edge of the upland basin divide. Ninety meters south of the site, a primary tributary of
Hog Creek gathers headwater runoff from the divide. This same southwest coursing
tributary flows past a series of upland sites. Vegetation is mainly thick thorny brush and
cacti with scattered mesquite. Minimal cover permits the unhindered movement of
extensive sheetwash runoff, which is accentuated by the impermeability of the Monteola
clay series soils (Soil Conservation Service 1980). It is in this environment that cultural
materials are exposed and redeposited along the slopes. Materials at 41AT81 are very
sparse and thinly scattered over the surface. Ten chert flakes, one Abasolo dart point
and one piece of burned rock make up the total inventory. A probe to 25 centimeters
produced no subsurface material. Given centuries of erosion, the site appears to date to
the Archaic Period.
41AT82
41AT82 is situated on the northern crest and slopes of one of the numerous
lobes that project from the upland basin divide. Approximately 150 meters north and 25
meters east of the site, two primary tributaries of Caballos Creek gather headwater
runoff from the divide. Perched atop the lobe, the site offers a view of the Souse/La
Parita Creek valley. Vegetation varies from fairly open mesquite savannah on the
upland flats and slopes to increasingly dense thorny brush on the lower slopes and
tributary banks. Short grasses and forbes occupy open areas on the flats and crests but
are less prevalent on the slopes. Unchecked by vegetation, runoff on the slopes has cut
gullies and rills between the brush. Caliche pan or substrates have been exposed on
these slopes. The calcareous Monteola clays (Soil Conservation Service 1980) on the
flats have eroded from the slopes, redepositing cultural material from the flats and
crests, as well as exposing those on the slopes. The combination of erosional factors
has probably enlarged the original occupation area. Cultural material from multiple
occupations is thinly spread on the upland flats, accumulating on the crests and slopes
to cover approximately 74,000 square meters. Concentrations of material are
observable primarily on the northwest slopes and secondarily on the north slope.
In the latter, a concentration of burned sandstone was recorded as Feature 1, a
hearth. Its compact morphology and depositional context suggest it is relatively intact.
Associated with Feature 1 were 3-5 chert flakes and a uniface. The primary
concentration area, on the northwest slopes, yielded flakes of chert and burned
palmwood, several thinned bifaces including dart points and performs, unifaces
including a palmwood scraper, cores of chert and palmwood, and burned rock. Burned
or thermally altered palmwood and increased utilization of sandstone as hearth material
are notable characteristics. Temporal diagnostics indicate the primary occupation area
is of Archaic age. The widespread distribution of the surface material is probably the
result of both reutilization of the site, at different localities by seasonally returning
groups, and erosional redeposition.

34 / San Miguel Prospect
41AT83
Encompassing 129,600 square meters, 41AT83 is a very dispersed series of
encampments situated in part atop an eroding knolltop remnant of the upland divide
and, to a greater extent, along the lower toe slopes and bottoms between two primary
headwater tributaries of Caballos Creek. As at 41AT82, the high elevation provides a
view of the La Parita Creek valley. Vegetation is characteristic of many sites in the area:
open mesquite savannah on the upland flats grading into dense thorny bursh along the
tributaries. Soils are shrink/swell calcareous clays of the Monteola series (Soil
Conservation Service 1980). The clays have eroded from an extant knoll atop the
upland area. Gullies and sheetwash have exposed underlying caliche covered shales
and sandstones, primarily on the toe slope and bottoms. The site is further disturbed by
a large, 152 by 30 meter pit/stock tank with an overburden pile. The tank is situated on
the north-northeastern limits of the site in the bottoms between the two tributaries where
water accumulates from runoff and probably overbank floods. Southwest and south of
the tank, concentrations of cultural material were observed in what appear to be linear
piles formed at the edge of a bulldozer or scraper blade. The majority of material in this
area is exposed on the caliche pan.
Cultural material includes secondary and tertiary flakes of chert, palmwood and
burned palmwood, bifaces such as gouges, dart points, performs and finished thinned
tools. Also present are unifaces, ground stone fragments and accumulations of burned
rock. Material atop the divide was dispersed to approximately one flake every 40 square
meters. Two dart points and a gouge were found at these higher levels. Although
artifactual material at 41AT83 is extensive, the most intensive use apparently centered
in the low-lying area between the tributaries. The sparsity on the higher elevations may
reflect intermittent, short-term extensions from the lower core of the site. Temporally
diagnostic dart points, Desmuke and Fairland, are Late or Transitional Archaic styles.
41AT84
This very small campsite encompasses a 21,600 square meter area about 40
meters north of the stock tank/borrow area described as the outer, northeast edge of
41AT83. The division between these two sites is probably more a function of modern
land use than prehistoric settlement.
41AT84 lies 150 meters south of the confluence of two primary tributaries of
Caballos Creek. Vegetation is mesquite savannah with grasses, forbes and cacti in
open areas. Soils, though in part shrink/swell clays, are mainly shallow Pettus loams
(Soil Conservation Service 1980). This isolated stretch of loams occupies the
bottomland area along the header tributaries. Unlike the majority of sites in this area,
the underlying caliche and sandstone substrates were not exposed at the site. The
primary source of erosion is a dirt road that leads to the tank, traversing the site area.
Observed cultural material suggests a limited use area or the outer limits of 41AT83.
Artifacts include 15-20 secondary and tertiary chert flakes, a biface tip and 5 pieces of
scattered burned rock. The sparsity and restricted range of the artifact assemblage
inhibits any functional or temporal interpretation of 41AT84.

Site Descriptions / 35
41AT85
41AT85 occupies approximately 44,800 square meters on the top, northeast
crest and slopes of an interfluvial lobe in the upland basin divide region of the Project
Area. The header tributary of a northwest trending primary tributary of Caballos Creek
lies to the north, while to the south another header tributary flows west to Hog Creek.
Ephemeral runoff from the interfluve to these tributaries has formed an east-southeast
trending saddle back ridge, isolating the higher lobe. The vegetation is characteristic of
the basin divide region: mesquite savannah over most of the knoll top with blackbrush
increasing along the crests and slopes. Other vegetation observed at the site includes
prickly pear and Spanish dagger, tasajillo, agarita, clump grasses and forbes.
Shallow calcareous clays characteristic of the uplands have formed in clayey
material. At 41AT85, the Fashing clay series (Soil Conservation Service 1980) were
surficially cracking during site recording in mid-July, after an unusually wet June.
Erosion of the topsoils is most apparent along the north and northeast toe slopes where
large areas of caliche, shales and sandstones are exposed on the flats and in gullies.
This area affords the greatest exposure of cultural material, a result of redeposition.
Artifacts in the more eroded northeast portion of the site include small pieces (<5
cm) of burned rock, several cores and specialized tools such as utilized flakes, a drill or
perforator fragment, a utilized biface and a dart point, as well as secondary and tertiary
chert flakes. Moving southwest and upslope, material thins out, with little to no burned
rock, in part a result of less erosional exposure and in part of less intensive occupation.
Material on the slopes included a distally beveled unifacial tool and chert flakes. On top,
close to the crest, a large, single-faceted sandstone grinding slab was found inverted,
with its grinding surface to the ground. No other tools were observed on the knoll top.
Here, the limited material includes mostly small (2-3 cm) tertiary chert flakes, and a
chalcedony flake was observed amid the cherts. Cultural material becomes sparse and
eventually ends at the southern and eastern crest.
The diversity of specialized tools – projectile points, a spokeshave, a
drill/perforator and gouge – in this upland environment suggests 41AT85 was the site of
recurring occupations oriented toward subsistence procurement and processing. The
large, relatively non-portable grinding slab may have been purposely left with the
intention of returning to the site, perhaps on a seasonal basis. The many tertiary flakes
are the product of tool maintenance. The absence of lithic raw material at the site
indicates that procurement for stone tool manufacture was apparently accomplished
elsewhere. Time diagnostics suggest Archaic occupations, probably on an established
reuse basis.
41AT86
This large 120,000 square meter site has been subjected to heavy redeposition
from severe erosion. Like 41AT85, the site occupies the top, north and northeast slopes
of an interfluve lobe in the upland basin divide region of the study area. Here, two
primary header tributaries of Caballos Creek gather runoff; one lies 100 meters

36 / San Miguel Prospect
northwest and the other 200 meters southeast of the site. Over the years, runoff to the
tributaries has formed a saddle back ridge; the site lies at the north end of the ridge.
The vegetation is thick chaparral along the slopes and fairly open mesquite savannah
on the top. Observed vegetation includes prickly pear, Spanish dagger, agarita, tasajillo,
clump grasses and forbes. Scattered blackbrush, mesquite and grasses have helped to
retain the soils on the northern and eastern flats as well as atop and along the upper
slopes of the lobe. This retention is the exception, the majority of the soils are gullied or
swept away by runoff. This is most pronounced on the northern and eastern flats where
caliche, shale and sandstone form the surface, with islands of grass and brush covered
soils. The soils are the Fashing clays (Soil Conservation Service 1980), formed in
clayey material.
Cultural material was varied and plentiful. The majority is exposed along the
northeast and north slopes and caliche flats. To the north, northeast and east, this
exposure is predominantly chert secondary and tertiary flakes with small quantities of
palmwood and quartzite. The palmwood is often annealed. Bifacially worked gouges,
projectile points, thinned bifaces, unifaces, scrapers and chert and palmwood cores and
flakes were dispersed across the flats and slopes. Only a small quantity of burned rock
was observed on the flats, the majority lay along the crests and upper slopes. Lithic raw
material was limited to erosional exposures of palmwood and several isolated chert
cobbles.
In summary, the majority of cultural material at the site is exposed on an eroded
caliche surface from the toe slope to the tributaries on the northwest and southeast.
Gullies have cut deeply into the sandstone and shale substrates. The site size is based
on the extent of observed cultural material, although the actual site was probably
smaller before erosional redeposition over the years scattered the original deposits. The
variety of tools and projectile points indicates a site utilized for acquisition and
subsequent processing of subsistence resources. Temporally diagnostic projectile
points suggest occupations during the Early Archaic (Early Triangular, Uvalde,
Tortugas) (Turner and Hester 1985) and Late Prehistoric periods. It is highly probable
that the site occupations span these periods, but artifact collection has seriously
depleted the number of chronological indicators on all the Prospect sites.
41AT87
This knolltop site is situated between two north-northeast flowing primary header
tributaries of Caballos and Souse Creeks. The site occupies the highest elevation in the
upland basin divide region of the study area. Vegetation is characterized by mesquite
savannah with prickly pear, agarita, tasajillo and clump grasses and forbes. Soils are
Campbellton loams (Soil Conservation Service 1980), formed in calcareous clayey and
loamy sediments. Soils at the site were noticeably dry and cracked. Observations based
on “hog holes” indicated shallow cultural deposits. Two transmission lines traverse the
site, one on the north and one on the south end. Cultural material has been exposed as
a result of clearing transmission corridors. This material is limited to a light scatter of
chert and palmwood flakes. Other cultural debris includes chert and palmwood cores, a

Site Descriptions / 37
uniface, two thinned bifaces, a dart point and a very light scatter of burned rock.
Material is dispersed over 20,000 square meters.
The area was apparently utilized during the Late Archaic Period. The present
distribution of cultural debris has been considerably altered from its original context.
Transmission line corridors, access roads and subsequent erosion, both natural and
artificially enhanced, are primarily responsible for the disruption of the cultural deposits.
41AT88
A small campsite, 41AT88, occupies a 3,000 square meter area along the lowlying flats of a primary tributary. The tributary, 80 meters west of the site, forms part of
the headwater system of Caballos Creek. Vegetation along the tributary is primarily
dense riparian whereas the site area is open grassland with isolated mesquite and
prickly pear. Soils are calcareous shrink/swell clays of the Monteola series (Soil
Conservation Service 1980). The surface soils are exposed along two transmission line
corridors and an access road that traverse the site. The resulting corridor exposures
include 20-30 chert flakes, mostly secondary and tertiary, two biface fragments, a core
and a very light scatter of burned rock. Obvious disturbance from transmission line and
road construction has both exposed and greatly disturbed the original site area. Given
their proximity, 41AT88 and 41AT84 may simply be alternative locations for similar
exploitation patterns but, unfortunately, no temporal diagnostics were recovered at
either site.
MCMULLEN COUNTY
41MC341
This large campsite occupies 93,750 square meters on the eastern valley
margins of La Jarita Creek. The eastern portion of the site rests on a knolltop; the
larger, western section includes a northwest-trending saddle back that ends at a lower
knolltop. Approximately 50 meters north of the site, a primary tributary flows west 500
meters to its confluence with La Jarita Creek.
Vegetation is confined to grasses and forbes that frow in fallow fields. The site
area is primarily improved pasture. Soils are sandy to sandy clay loams of the Brundage
Series and calcareous shrink/swell clays of the Monteola series (Soil Conservation
Service 1980). The fine sandy loams of the slopes are alluvial in origin, while atop the
eastern knoll calcareous clays predominate. Shovel probes indicate soils 50 centimeters
deep on the southwest crest of the eastern knoll and 30 centimeters deep on the
western knolltop; the saddle soils are 20 centimeters deep and clayey.
Eight shovel probes produced one to five flakes and the same number of burned
rock fragments. Cultural material is exposed on the margins of a shallow, 30 by 50
meter borrow depression on the southwestern and southern crest of the eastern knoll.
Here, two burned rock concentrations, triangular dart points, bifaces and biface
fragments, chert flakes and cores are eroding from the northern and northeastern

38 / San Miguel Prospect
margins. An isolated sandstone metate fragment (26x14 cm), a portion of a larger slab
fragmented by plowing, was found 75 meters northeast of the concentrations.
Burned rock, chert secondary and tertiary flakes were mapped 90 meters
northwest and 70 meters south of the borrow area. Artifacts were more diverse and
numerous in the low-lying saddle between the knolls. Chert bifaces fragments, dart
point fragments, bifaces, a uniface, gouges, utilized flakes, cores, a graver, a scraper
and chert secondary and tertiary flakes are concentrated in a 75 by 100 meter area just
north of an oil tank access road. Thirty-nine assorted artifacts were mapped at the site.
Most lithic material is chert except for one palmwood biface. Obvious post-depositional
disturbances, which include the borrow area, an oil and gas pad, access road and
repeated plowing, have altered the surficial as well as the subsurface integrity of the
site.
The site is well-situated for the exploitation of creekside resources. Lithic
procurement, food gathering and processing, and tool maintenance are suggested by
gravels, a variety of tools and the grinding slab fragment. The last, too unwieldy for easy
transport, was probably stored in anticipation of a return to the site. Occupation(s) can
only be generally assigned to the Archaic Period.
41MC342
Encompassing an area of approximately 136,000 square meters, 41MC342
occupies the western margins and top of a long north-south divide between La Jarita
Creek to the west and Salt Branch to the east, 1.5 kilometers north of their confluence.
The continuous scatter extends south along the divide and onto private property. The
majority of the site overlooks the La Jarita valley; site 41MC341 lies 300 meters to the
west.
Vegetation is a combination of mesquite savannah on the flats and blackbrush
chaparral on the slopes. The clays which cover the site surface are calcareous
shrink/swell soils of the Monteola series (Soil Conservation Service 1980). The depth of
topsoil varies considerably. Two probes approximately 50 meters apart on the upper
elevations reached depths from 5 to 45 centimeters, while along the slopes and level
areas, soil depths range from 5 to 20 centimeters. Erosional gullies, formed between the
brush on slopes, have swept the calcareous clays downslope, leaving exposures of
caliche and sandstone. The level, more open areas along the western margins have
been subjected to sheetwash and some gullying. Probes indicate significant variability in
distribution of subsurface cultural deposits. Most material, minimal and best, lay in the
upper 5 to 10 centimeters. The majority of the cultural debris lies redeposited in the
gullies and sheetwash areas, exaggerating the extent of the occupation.
One of two observed burned rock concentrations with associated cultural debris
was noted on the western crest. A probe into this area showed burned rock to 11
centimeters. Chert artifacts were limited to several (2-10) flakes and a biface fragment.
The second concentration lies at relatively the same elevation but on the southwest
crest of the site, bordering the southern study area boundary. Here a large area of

Site Descriptions / 39
burned rock was noted on the surface; associated artifacts include flakes of chert,
mostly secondary, utilized flakes, two multidirectional cores, a dart point tip and a thick
biface. No probes were done because gullies and road cuts indicated shallow (5 cm)
deposits.
The remaining cultural material is thinly scattered over the surface of the site,
largely in erosional areas. The lithic inventory is dominated by chert secondary flakes
with lesser quantities of primary and tertiary flakes. Other material included burned rock,
utilized flakes, cores and bifaces, both thick and thin. Palmwood flakes and several
cores were also present but to a lesser extent. The dominance of secondary/primary
flakes may result from sampling bias or from primary reduction that was accomplished
at the site. The low frequency of specialized tool types, solely utilized flakes, supports
the latter interpretation. The abundance of cores suggests a flake technology. The dart
points suggest Archaic occupations. In summary, 41MC342 was well-situated for the
exploitation of nearby resources, including the acquisition of lithic raw material.
41MC343
Only 40,000 square meters of this site are recorded; the remainder is on
neighboring, private lands to the south and west. 41MC343 is on the outer edge of
extensive Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits of gravels, sand, silt and clay which cap
the divide between La Jarita and San Miguel creeks (Bureau of Economic Geology
1976). The site is on the northeast slopes of the divide and extends onto the La Jarita
valley margins. Vegetation on the site proper consists of open areas of clump grasses,
prickly pear and forbes with scattered mesquite and blackbrush. The soils are very
gravelly clays with large chert cobbles and cultural material interspersed along the
slopes. Erosion, accelerated by senderos, borrowing and clearing, has heavily affected
the distribution of cultural material.
The observed assemblage included primary and secondary chert flakes, tested
cobbles, cores, early stage thick bifaces and a manufacturing failure during initial
reduction. A palmwood flake was also noted amid the cherts. Burned rock was
restricted to the upper slopes in the southwest corner of the site where one
concentration may be a remnant hearth.
Proximity to this large lithic source with good, usable cherts probably contributed
to the intensity of occupation. Modern exploitation of the gravels is shown by their
extensive use for road beds and oil well pads in the area.
41MC344
This 34,500 square meter campsite has been greatly altered by natural and
artificial processes. Located along the western terraces of La Jarita Creek, 41MC344
has been subjected to sendero and transmission line corridor clearing as well as
pumpjack and oil tank pad construction. Many of the gravels used for pad construction
came from the nearby Pleistocene deposits that cap the divide approximately 75 to 150
meters west of the site. As a consequence, artifacts, such as thinned stage bifaces, dart

40 / San Miguel Prospect
point fragments and flakes from sites on the divide, have been introduced to the
41MC344 site area, specifically on the northern end where pads are concentrated. A
sendero running northwest to southeast along the eastern edge of the site has exposed
artifacts along the La Jarita terraces and their margins. Subsequent erosion has
increased this exposure and, in many cases, redeposited cultural material onto rills and
sheetwash areas. The majority of cultural deposits are confined to the southern and
southeastern areas of the site. The southern site boundary extends beyond the study
area fenceline, restricting recording to only a small portion of the scatter beyond the
fence.
Vegetation changes from fairly dense to moderately dense mesquite/blackbrush
on the upper terraces to a dense, mixed riparian community along floodplain terraces.
This latter community is composed of species of cacti, mesquite and other unidentified
trees. Prickly pear, grasses and forbes are scattered over the open areas. Soils are
predominantly fine sandy loams to sandy clay loams of the Brundage series, formed in
loamy sediments presumed to be ancient alluvium (Soil Conversation Service 1980).
Expanses of sandy loams are exposed in cleared areas.
Cultural debris is unevenly scattered over most of the site but concentrated in
only three areas; one on the exposed terrace margins on the east side of the site, and
two along a fenceline and roads on the south side of the site. These concentrations are
mainly burned rock scatters with associated cultural debris. Area 1 on the terrace
margins is largely chert flakes with an early stage thick biface and a triangular projectile
point. Two smaller areas along the southern fenceline roads contain eroding burned
rock (<5 cm), mostly chert, various chert flakes, a palmwood gouge and an unidentified
stemmed dart point. All of these areas are the result of erosional exposure. Other
mapped material includes small amounts of mussel shell, dart points, thick and thin
bifaces, unifaces and chert primary, secondary and tertiary flakes. Occupation(s), based
on the presence of dart points, one of which was identified as an Abasolo, span the
Archaic. With the exception of one palmwood gouge, the chipped stone artifacts are
chert. Chert-bearing stream gravels were observed in the southwest area of the site as
well as in the La Jarita banks and bed. Also available are extensive chert-bearing gravel
deposits on the nearby divide.
41MC345
This very long, linear (northwest to southeast) concentration of cultural debris
parallels La Jarita Creek along the upper western terraces. Sites 41MC343 and
41MC344 lie south and southwest of the site, respectively. For convenience in
recording, this site was divided into two areas: Area A northwest of an ephemeral
tributary and Area B to the southeast. The two areas total 124,000 square meters. The
western boundary of the study area runs along the perimeter of this site. Cultural debris
became sparser and more thinly scattered to the west, leading to the supposition that
the major portion of the site has been recorded.
Vegetation varies from open, grassy fallow fields to dense riparian growth along
the creek. The fenced field in Area A is surrounded by large oak and mesquite trees; a

Site Descriptions / 41
strip between Areas A and B is dense mesquite. The majority of Area B is open
grassland and scattered brush. Also growing in both areas are prickly pear, jerusalem
thorn, tasajillo and blackbrush. Soils vary from fine sandy loams to sandy clay loams
formed in loamy sediments with variable gravel inclusions. Eroding terrace margins,
between 15 and 30 meters from the creek, displayed stream gravels and sandstone
substrates on and below sandy surfaces. An old county road, ranch roads, plowing and
cattle trails are other major contributors to the heavy erosion that has marred the site.
The occupation of a 1940s house in the southeast protion of Area B has added to the
post-depositional disturbances.
The cultural debris from Area A indicates a much utilized locality where varied
activities took place. Artifacts and burned rock are observable in the fenced field on the
northwest end of Area A. Here, chert secondary and tertiary flakes are evenly scattered
over the area with bifaces, unifaces and cores interspersed throughout. A concentration
of sandstone fragments and chert gravels on the northwest end of the field is probably
the result of plowing since no apparent alignment, burning, individual utilization or other
cultural use could be discerned. A concentration (80x30 m) of artifacts lies 20 meters
southeast of the accumulation. Recorded and, in some cases, collected tools include
unifacial and bifacial distally beveled tools, multi-, bi- and unidirectional cores, two dart
points, an arrow point and probable arrow point manufacturing failure, both thick stage
and thin stage bifaces and biface fragments. The concentration thins out somewhat for
40 meters to the southeast, then radically increases along the southern margins of an
old east-west road, and continues to the Area A/Area B boundary. Five accumulations
of burned rock were observed in an area between the old road bed and the boundary
drainage. In some cases, these represent erosional accumulations but others appear to
be exposed hearths. Cultural debris included high densities of secondary and tertiary
chert flakes with some palmwood in evidence. Other artifacts included unidirectional,
bidirectional and exhausted cores, bifaces and biface fragments, dart point basal
fragments, chopper tools, unifacial tools, a distally beveled biface and a utilized flake.
Shovel probes indicate a 30 to 50 centimeter depth of cultural deposit with
concentrations of burned rock between 20 and 30 centimeters.
Area B is larger than Area A but less densely covered with cultural material. The
largest concentration, composed of burned rock, flakes, bifaces and hammerstone, lies
in a fallow field at the northwest end of the area near the entrance gate. Shovel probes
indicate 20 centimeters of cultural deposit consisting of 5 to 10 pieces of burned rock
less than five centimeters in size and three flakes. The remainder of Area B is covered
with chert flakes and scattered burned rock. A concentration of palmwood flakes found
190 meters to the southeast of the gate concentration may indicate a work area. The
most common raw material is chert with a secondary preference for palmwood.
Pleistocene gravels lie approximately 200 meters to the west. Burned rock is both chert
and, to a lesser extent, sandstone. Diagnostic projectile points, a Scallorn arrow point,
an Ensor-like dart point, and an Abasolo dart point suggest occupations spanning the
Archaic into Late Prehistoric times.

42 / San Miguel Prospect
41MC346
This long (300 m) linear scatter of cultural debris occupies a 45,000 square meter
area between La Jarita Creek on the east and an oil field road on the west. The latter
forms the western boundary of the study area. It is probable that a thin scatter extends
beyond this boundary and onto private property, since cultural material trends in this
direction. The major site area runs northwest-southeast along the western terrace of La
Jarita Creek. Differences in modern land use are apparent across the site. The cleared
and plowed lower third is more eroded than the less intensively cultivated upper section.
Vegetation on the upper western terrace surface is basically open prickly pear
and clump grasses. Along the modern floodplain and terrace edges, a dense riparian
community consists of oak species and mesquite. Mesquite on the flats has been
sprayed with poison so that only “skeletal trees” remain.
Sheetwash erosion is evident in open areas where subsequent rills and gullies
have exposed and redeposited stream gravels and cultural debris over most of the site.
The concentration of material closer to the creek may be the result either of erosion or
more intensive occupation. One area of concentration (A), has been exposed in a
meander cutbank on the northern site area. Here, burned rock from hearths, flakes,
tools and snail shell were observed in the walls and bank slump. Further material lies on
the surface in a 50 meter (north-south) by 15 meter (east-west) area that fringes the
cutbank exposures. A 60-centimeter deep shovel probe into the concentration located
31 tertiary flakes and fist size burned rock between 0 and 40 centimeters, and 1 tertiary
flake and 2 small burned rocks between 40 and 60 centimeters. Hence, some depth of
deposit, although mixed, remains in this area. Further west, north and south, cultural
material is generally dispersed.
One hundred and twenty meters south of concentration A, and 35 meters west of
the creek, concentration B contains flakes, a thin biface, one core, a distally beveled
biface, burned rock and two shaped sandstone fragments. A shovel probe into this area
indicated 20 centimeters of deposit consisting of one chert flake, two chips and three
small (<5 cm) pieces of burned rock. To the west and to the south, cultural material
thins toward the southern boundary, an east-west tributary separating 41MC346 from
41MC347.
Slightly east-northeast and 30 meters from concentration B, a long (~80 m) levee
or remnant terrace edge has been isolated by north-south flowing gullies on the west
and east. A uniface and several flakes were observed on the surface in one area of the
levee. A shovel probe here found two flakes between 0 and 40 centimeters of moist clay
loam. This remnant terrace probably represents the outer, isolated edge of the site
where buried deposits are retained. Cultural material varies in quantity across the site,
but its composition is consistent with other assemblages found at sites along the La
Jarita Creek valley. Both thick and thin bifaces, a gouge, dart points and an arrow point,
unifaces on split cobbles or primary flakes, a spokeshave, flakes, cores, burned rock,
shaped sandstone fragments and snail shell make up the observed and collected

Site Descriptions / 43
artifact assemblage at 41MC346. Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of occupation are
indicated by triangular dart points and a Perdiz arrow point.
41MC347
This small campsite occupies a 7,000 square meter area bounded by two
tributaries on the western terraces of La Jarita Creek. 41MC345(A) lies approximately
50 meters to the southwest and 41MC346 shares the northern tributary boundary.
Moderate to dense grasses and mesquite, oak and hackberry grow along the floodplain
terraces. Scattered mesquite and prickly pear make up the vegetation in the western,
cleared area of the site. Cleared vegetation and earth are piled along the edge of the
riparian overstory community on the east, south and north sides of the site. Soils vary
from wet, sticky black clay loams on the outer terraces to the east to fine sandy loams
on the western exposed areas.
During clearing, approximately 10 centimeters of soil were stripped off with the
vegetation, exposing cultural debris. A concentration of debris is apparent in an area
just west of the piles (15 m E/W by 50 m N/S). Two areas were isolated amid the
surface exposures; Area 1 is a 15 by 25 meter concentration on the northeast edge and
Area 2 a 10 by 10 meter concentration on the southwest edge. Area 1 is largely
composed of scattered burned rock (from <5 cm to fist sized) and a fairly dense scatter
of secondary and tertiary chert flakes, two dart point tip fragments, one arrow point
blade, one complete unifacial Perdiz point, two thinned biface distal fragments, two
bifaces performs (one of petrified wood), three sandstone fragments from grinding
implements, a core fragment and core chopper, a utilized flake and a small quantity of
mussel and snail shell. A shovel probe into the concentration found cultural material,
consisting of burned bone, burned mussel shell, snail shell, burned rock (5-20 cm) and
chert flakes to 40 centimeters.
Area 2 consists predominantly of chert cores with a small scatter of burned rock,
flakes and bifaces. The mapped material includes one bidirectional chert core, one core
chopper, one dart point base, one broken thinned biface and two split cobble blanks
with two to five flakes off the dorsal surface. Both areas could be redeposited material,
but the probe into Area 1 suggests the possibility of some intact cultural deposits. Area
2 may be the remains of an isolated work area. Other artifacts found in the clearing
include a gouge, a thinned biface distal fragment and a unidirectional core. In
comparison, the floodplain terrace that rims the site to the east and north is a remnant
of the site as yet untouched by clearing. The size and age of trees suggest a long
standing, stable area. Artifacts were observed in rodent backdirt piles on the northern
terraces and to some extent on the surface of terrace margins to the east. Fifteen
meters due east of Areas 1 and 2, one burned rock feature was found on the terrace
margin. Feature 1, a 50 by 50 centimeter area of burned chert cobble fragments, is an
exposed hearth in association with five chert flakes. They and the feature constitute
Area 3. A shovel probe 5 meters northwest of Feature 1 found two chert chips, a
secondary chert flake and a small piece of burned rock in 30 centimeters of alluvial
deposits. It is possible that buried intact cultural deposits lie below the surface of the
remaining north and east terrace as well as in Area 1. Archaic and Late Prehistoric

44 / San Miguel Prospect
occupations are suggested by the presence of dart point fragments, an arrow blade and
a unifacial Perdiz point.
41MC348
This site is the northernmost recorded on the western terraces of La Jarita Creek.
Like 41MC345 and 41MC346, this long, linear concentration follows the terrace,
paralleling the creek 10 to 20 meters from the water. Unlike those southern sites,
41MC348 is small, occupying only 9,000 square meters. The northwest end of the site
abuts the study area boundary, a north-south fenceline and oil field road.
Vegetation is characteristic of the upper western terraces where prickly pear and
clump grasses predominate. Scattered lifeless mesquite, chemically destroyed, dots the
landscape. The lower terraces are populated with moderately dense riparian growth;
mesquite and oak are the dominant overstory. The alluvial, sandy loam soils are
sheetwashed, rilled and gullied in the open areas.
Chert flakes, tools and burned rock fragments have been exposed on the surface
covering an area 180 meters from northwest to southeast and 50 meters from northeast
to southwest. Artifacts are unevenly scattered over the surface, with two areas of
concentration. Area 1 lies on the northwest end and Area 2 on the southeast end. Area
1, approximately 15 by 15 meters, contains burned rock fragments, chert secondary and
tertiary flakes, two dart point distal fragments, one thick and one thin stage biface and a
bifacial Nueces tool. A shovel probe 70 centimeters deep into this concentration found
that cultural debris (three burned rock fragments and one chert chip) is limited to the
upper 20 centimeters. Cultural material in Area 2, at the southeast edge of the
terrace/site boundary, was sparser. Surface specimens include burned rock fragments,
flakes, two dart points and a multidirectional core. Subsurface probes encountered nine
chert flakes and ten small pieces of burned rock to 50 centimeters below surface. Other
artifacts, all of chert, include two core fragments and one thick stage biface. Early
Archaic occupations are suggested by the presence of a Gower-like dart point from
Area 2 and Middle to Late Archaic occupations by the Nueces tool from Area 1.
41MC349
This site occupies a 100 meter-wide strip paralleling Salt Branch from the
southern study area boundary northeast to the eastern boundary, a distance of one
kilometer. Based on artifacts observed on neighboring private property, the site
continues to the northeast and southwest. Although the northeast portion lies in upland
margins, the majority of the site lies within the Salt Branch valley between Salt Branch
to the northwest and one of its primary tributaries to the southeast; the confluence lies
approximately 100 meters southwest of the study area boundary fence. Salt Branch has
not cut a deep bed, but forms a wide swath in its southwest flow to La Jarita Creek.
The site area has been used for improved pasture; now short grasses, forbes
and some sunflowers cover most of the surface. Erosion along the edge of the left bank
has exposed a 10 to 30 meter wide area of substrate that slopes to the creek bed. Soil

Site Description / 45
profiles at the crest reveal between 5 and 10 centimeters of clay loams over caliche.
The remaining soils show artifacts still embedded in the matrix but, as a result of the
extensive erosion, some have been redeposited onto the exposed substrate.
Nine areas of artifact concentration were mapped amid an uneven distribution of
chert flakes and some burned rock. Except for one area on the grassy flats, these
concentrations are confined to exposures on the substrate surface. Four are eroding
hearth remnants; clusters of burned chert and some burned sandstone that lie directly
on the caliche or are eroding from the remaining soils. Very few artifacts, usually only a
very light scatter of chert flakes, were found in association with these remnant hearths.
One exception is Area 6 where two dart points and a hammerstone were peripheral to
the concentration.
Three other areas consisted of burned rock, tool and flake exposures. Area 4
held snail shell and a sandstone grinding slab fragment similar to the one at 41MC341;
Area 7 contained a Nueces biface, a unifacial gouge, a unifacial scraper, a Paleoindian
or Early Archaic drill/perforator basal fragment snapped at mid-point, a triangular dart
point and a palmwood biface fragment. Area 9, farthest to the northeast, contained
largely secondary and tertiary flakes and one triangular dart point. Other artifacts within
60 meters north of Area 9 include two multidirectional cores, two triangular dart points,
one thick stage biface, one thin stage biface fragment and a cortex “backed” chopper.
The two remaining areas are a burned clay concentration on the grassy flats that could
be the result of historic burning of cleared vegetation or a prehistoric campfire, and a
concentration of snail shell.
In summary, material is confined to the exposed left bank edges of Salt Branch
and to a lesser extent the flat between Salt Branch and the tributary. Artifacts were also
seen eroding from the thin soil mantle observed in profile along the bank edges. The
nine concentrations appear to be activity areas, but the erosional nature of the site
makes this assumption tenuous. Based on observed dart points, tools and the Nueces
biface, the site was probably reoccupied at various times throughout the Archaic.
41MC350
Predominantly situated on the upland margins, and extending onto the lower,
northwest terraces of Salt Branch, this site occupies a 258,400 square meter area
directly across the creek from 41MC349. 41MC350 is bounded to the southwest by a
tributary, to the northwest by uncleared, dense thorny brush and to the southeast by
Salt Branch. Apart from the chaparral to the northwest, most of the site is covered with
grasses, forbes, scattered brush and prickly pear. The soils are shallow clays over
caliche substrates. Sheetwash and gullying have eroded the shallow clay soils,
exposing caliche along the creek, at the tributary confluence and on the upper margins.
Surficial cultural material includes an uneven scatter of chert flakes, tools and burned
rock. Flakes were mostly secondary and tertiary, although one primary flake was
observed. Isolated tools, confined to the southwest, include a stemmed dart point, a
unifacial gouge, a thin stage biface and a multidirectional core, all of chert.

46 / San Miguel Prospect
Four concentrations of chert flakes and burned rock were mapped on the
margins and one, Area 1, in a gully on the creek bank. Artifacts in Area 1 include a
complete sandstone grinding slab, flakes and burned rock; Area 2 held only flakes and
burned rock, Area 3 a thick stage biface, Area 4 burned rocks and flakes, and Area 5 a
thick stage biface. Most of these are sheetwash exposures of underlying material.
A shovel probe at the 320-foot contour revealed 14 small pieces of burned rock
and a broken flake to 10 centimeters in a 25 centimeter probe. Post-depositional
disturbances – clearing, burning, plowing and erosion – have considerably altered the
integrity of the cultural deposits. Site size and the distribution of cultural debris do not
necessarily reflect the extent of prehistoric activity. The presence of a Morhiss dart point
suggests Late Archaic occupation(s).
41MC351
The location of this 88,000 square meter site is similar to 41MC350, extending
from the Salt Branch valley onto the upland margins. 41MC351 lies southwest, across a
primary tributary from 41MC350. 41MC349 is southeast, across Salt Branch. As is the
case with 41MC349 and 41MC350, the vegetation, scattered grasses, forbes and
prickly pear, is primarily the result of cleared land left fallow. Soils are calcareous clays.
Cultural debris is limited to an irregular scatter of chert tertiary and secondary
flakes and a burned rock concentration found amid gravels along the primary tributary.
No formal tools were observed near the concentration. Limited cultural material was
found to 20 centimeters in a probe done at about 320 feet AMSL. Isolated tools include
a stemmed dart point, one thick and one thin biface, a bidirectional core and two
unifaces, one distally beveled. Along the lower elevations (below 290′ AMSL), mapped
and/or collected artifacts include a thick biface and a cortex backed core chopper.
Except for a few palmwood flakes, all material is chert. Chert-bearing stream gravels
are scattered over much of the upper elevations.
Post-depositional disturbance, as at 41MC349 and 41MC350, includes clearing,
plowing, burning and erosion. Site occupation(s), as suggested by one stemmed dart
point, could be anytime during the Archaic.
41MC352
This site occupies a 28,800 square meter area northwest of 41MC351. On this
higher elevation of the upland margins, abundant stream gravels litter the site surface.
Limited chert cobbles (5-10 cm) interspersed throughout these gravels rest on a clay
surface exposed by recent clearing. The land appears to have been used for improved
pasture. Clearing and burning, evident in several areas where charred pieces of wood
remain from piled vegetation, could account for the sparse burned rock irregularly
scattered over the site.
Artifacts appear to have been redeposited; unimpeded runoff has caused rills
and gullies where gravels have accumulated. The total assemblage includes chert

Site Descriptions / 47
secondary and tertiary flakes, two thick stage bifaces (1 chert, 1 palmwood) and a
uniface.
41MC353
This site lies amid cultivated grasses on the upland margins overlooking Salt
Branch, bordered on the north by a strip of mesquite, thorny brush and cacti along FM
791. Most of the artifacts were found between the strip of vegetation and the plowed
field, with some observed on sheetwashed surfaces between vegetation and in the
open field. Artifacts from the field included 10 to 15 chert secondary and tertiary flakes,
a unidirectional core and a utilized flake. Two small concentrations are limited to 5 to 10
flakes and scattered burned rocks (< 5 cm); a third also has an associated core
fragment. Two shovel probes into the open field revealed no cultural material to 20
centimeters in the calcareous shrink/swell clays. Based on observed surficial distribution
of material, the site was estimated at 46,800 square meters. No temporal markers were
found on the site.
41MC354
This long, linear occupation area runs southwest from a lobe of the basin divide
to within 50 meters of 41MC342, a distance of approximately one kilometer. The gap in
the surface debris which separates the sites may well be the result of modern land use
and not of prehistoric activity. Although the two may have once been one larger site, no
continuity is currently demonstrated. 41MC354, encompassing 159,000 square meters,
overlooks the La Jarita Creek valley to the west and the Salt Branch valley to the east.
Vegetation consists of short clump grasses in a fallow field with old furrows
running north-south. The central portion of the site appears to be shallow “saddle back”
where vegetation is less pronounced, the result of plowing and recent regrowth. The far
southwest end is cleared and occupied by a house built in the last 10 years. Soils are
calcareous shrink/swell clays of the Monteola series (Soil Conservation Service 1980)
that were noticeably dry and cracked at the time of site recording in the early part of
July.
The cultural assemblage is extremely limited for such an elongated site. Three
concentrations of burned rock and flakes are confined to the northeast portion of the
site. The remainder is a thin and irregular scatter of flakes and, in a few instances,
burned rock. The observed flakes and tools include mostly tertiary and secondary
flakes, two cores of chert (one unidirectional, one multidirectional from concentration 3),
three thick stage bifaces (one from concentration 2, one from concentration 3), a
unifacially worked primary flake and a core chopper. All worked material is chert. The
only other lithic resource present, palmwood, was confined to burned rock. The site
yielded no temporally diagnostic projectile points or tools.

48 / San Miguel Prospect
41MC355
This site, like 41MC354 to the east, occupies a long (450 m) linear area atop the
ridge of a divide. To the west lies the La Jarita Creek valley and to the east, a primary
tributary flows past 41MC341, and into La Jarita. The site at its widest (100 m), covers
the ridge top. At the southern lobe of the divide, the Perry Rays family home was built
within the last 30 to 40 years. The total area encompassed by the house and associated
activity areas is 380 meters north-south and 80 meters east-west. Hence, a good
percentage of the 45,000 square meter site area has been disturbed by recent land use.
The field just northwest of the house has been cultivated and subsequently subjected to
heavy sheetwash and shallow gullying. The calcareous shrink-swell clays have actively
added to the disturbance (Fig. 5a), exposing a limited quantity of secondary and tertiary
chert flakes and burned rock. The only recorded tools, one thin biface medial fragment
and a thick stage biface, are from the eroded area. The Rays house is included within
the site area because projectile points were reported in that area by the family. No
temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed by the surveyors.
41MC356
The 80,000 square meters recorded for this prehistoric encampment are only a
portion of a larger site area that extends east onto private property, and the upland
divide that separates La Jarita Creek and Salt Branch. The site is situated along a ridge
on the western margins of the divide with primary tributaries bounding it on the north
and south. The site area has been sprayed with chemicals to retard the spread of
mesquite; skeletal trees are interspersed with blackbrush and agarita, prickly pear, low
grasses and forbes. The shallow calcareous clays of the Fashing series (Soil
Conservation Service 1980) are exposed in some areas. These and a north-south
pipeline offer the best surface visibility.
One area of concentration, a large, unvegetated eroded surface, consists of
mostly secondary and tertiary chert flakes and several small pieces of burned rock with
one untyped, stemless dart point. Mapped or collected artifacts include a bidirectional
chert core, a thin stage biface and biface fragment, an exhausted core, a uniface and a
distally beveled biface. These and the limited flake and burned rock scatter are the
extent of observed cultural debris. Two shovel probes show only five centimeters of
soils without any subsurface material. The dart point suggests Archaic occupation(s).
41MC357
Like 41MC356, the 32,400 square meters of site area are part of a larger site
extending east onto inaccessible property. A north-south fenceline running across the
east end of the site is the eastern study area boundary. The fenceline traverses a fairly
level ridge projecting from the western margins of the upland divide. The recorded site
area extends from the fenceline to the tip of the ridge. To the west, the site overlooks a
large floodplain created by runoff and two primary tributaries’ eventual confluence with a
large primary tributary of La Jarita Creek.

Site Descriptions / 49

Figure 5. Vegetation typical of the three physiographic zones.

50 / San Miguel Prospect
The site area is covered with scattered dead mesquite, thick thorny brush, dense
grasses, forbes, wildflowers, prickly pear and other assorted cacti. The thick ground
cover gives way to several erosional exposures of underlying caliche and sandstone
along the top and southern slopes. The overlying calcareous clays of the Fashing series
(Soil Conservation Service 1980) have eroded from much of the site surface, apparently
the result of land modification in the past. The surface of many of the caliche and
sandstone exposures has been gouged, pitted and scraped by bulldozer land clearing.
Although historic land modification has marred the integrity of cultural deposits,
some may still conform to the areas utilized by prehistoric populations. A fairly
continuous scatter of secondary and tertiary chert flakes was observed on the surface.
Area 1, a concentration of burned rocks (5-10 cm length) and flakes recorded on the
southwest crest, is probably a remnant hearth. Although tools and cores were found all
over the site, most were within 40 meters of Area 1. The lithic assemblage from this
portion of the site includes two unifaces, two thinned biface fragments, one primary
flake with flakes removed from the ventral surface, and two cores – one multidirectional,
one exhausted. Observed lithics from the remainder of the site include one uniface
fragment (scraper), one primary flake, two arrow points – one Scallorn and one distal
fragment – one triangular dart point of petrified wood, one utilized flake, two thick stage
bifaces, two thin biface fragments (one petrified wood) and a distally beveled biface. A
cursory examination of flakes indicated both hard and soft hammer percussion. With the
exception of two tools made from petrified wood, all material is chert. Based on the
arrow points and dart point, the site was probably occupied at some time during the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric.
41MC358
This site, like 41MC356 and 41MC357, lies along the western margins of the
upland divide that separates the headwater runoff areas of Salt Branch to the east and
a primary tributary of La Jarita Creek to the west. On the south, an ephemeral tributary
forms a shallow valley between this site and 41MC357. Occupying a 4,900 square
meter area on the lower slopes of the margins, this is the smallest of the partially
exposed sites along these western margins. Observed artifacts indicate the site extends
to the east of the study area boundary fence. Most of the site is covered by thick
grasses, forbes and occasional wildflowers with scattered prickly pear, blackbrush and
several dead mesquites. The shallow calcareous Fashing clays (Soil Conservation
Service 1980) have eroded, exposing the underlying caliche substrate. During the
recording of the site, dry surface cracks were noticeable.
Cultural debris consists of a thin, uneven scatter of secondary and tertiary flakes
and some burned rock. No areas of concentration were observed and a shovel probe
found no cultural material to 20 centimeters. Recorded and mapped artifacts consist of
one thin stage biface fragment and one dart point midsection. The presence of the dart
point fragment suggests the site was occupied at some time during the Archaic.

Site Descriptions / 51
41MC359
This 49,400 square meter site lies on the southeast slopes of a saddle back
divide that trends from northeast to southwest. A primary tributary of La Jarita Creek lies
approximately 50 meters to the southeast. A sendero and a transmission line corridor
that traverse the site have cleared routes through the scattered mesquite, blackbrush,
thorny brush, cacti, grasses, forbes and wildflowers on the slopes. The lower toe slope
and the tributary are choked with low thorny brush. Game trails through this area serve
as channels for erosional runoff. Along the middle to upper margins, gullies and
sheetwash have exposed the underlying caliche substrates leaving only a thin clay
topsoil remnant of the highly saline and calcareous Monteola series (Soil Conservation
Service 1980).
The uneven scatter of cultural material is surficial. Two shovel probes show soil
only five centimeters deep, and no cultural debris. Although secondary flakes are
present, tertiary flakes were more frequently observed on exposed caliche, and some
on the clay surface. Flake counts are extremely low; a spot check indicates both hard
and soft hammer percussion. Small amounts of burned rock and chert cobbles (5-10 cm
in length) were also present. Other material, spread out on the lower slopes and in the
cleared corridors, includes one chalcedony Scallorn arrow point, one triangular dart
point, one thin stage biface fragment, a uniface and uniface fragment, one primary flake
with initial bifacial reduction, four retouched flakes (one chalcedony) and two
unidirectional cores. Except for the chalcedony flake and arrow point, all lithic material is
chert. The Scallorn arrow point and the triangular dart point suggest Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations.
41MC360
Site 41MC360 is a 54,000 square meter area on an eroded remnant on the
southwest side of the upland divide. A primary tributary of Hog Creek flows west of the
site; another on the east feeds La Jarita Creek. Two knoll tops, about 100 meters apart,
form the east and west portions of the site with a low-lying area in between giving the
site a saddle back configuration.
The soils are shallow calcareous shrink/swell Fashing clays (Soil Conservation
Service 1980). Runoff has led to deflation of the clayey topsoils and subsequent
exposure of the caliche substrates on the western midslopes. Erosion has been
accelerated by clearing for three senderos. On site, the vegetation is moderately open
mesquite savannah with scattered blackbrush, agarita, prickly pear, Spanish dagger,
tasajillo, clump grasses, forbes, wildflowers and other cacti. The mesquite trees were
noticeably taller (4-6 m) on the knoll tops, probably the result of less clearing at these
higher elevations.
The exposed prehistoric cultural debris consists of an uneven scatter of chert
tertiary flakes, fewer secondary flakes, two primary flakes and small pieces of burned
rock. All burned rock and most of the flakes are chert, although several palmwood
flakes were observed.

52 / San Miguel Prospect
Two concentrations of cultural material were recorded on the eastern knoll. In
Area 1 (70×30 m), exposed along a sendero, mapped artifacts include four thin stage
bifaces, three thinned biface fragments, two thick bifaces, one triangular palmwood dart
point, one distally beveled biface and one uniface, one trimmed flake, one
multidirectional palmwood core and one exhausted core. Mapped artifacts in Area 2
(8×8 m), 30 meters southwest of Area 1, are a dart point distal fragment and an
exhausted core. Outside these concentrations, dispersed artifacts include two thin stage
bifaces, two stemmed dart points from the west knoll – one chalcedony Uvalde-like, one
Bell – two dart point distal fragments, one dart point midsection (from west knoll), one
untyped dart point base, two unifaces (one used as spokeshave, from west knoll), one
trimmed secondary flake and two thick bifaces (one possibly used as a chopper).
Palmwood and chalcedony were utilized, but not as extensively as chert. Although chert
raw material is present, only several tested cobbles were observed. The dart points
indicate site occupation(s) during the Archaic. The Uvalde and Bell styles, specifically,
are of Early Archaic age.
41MC361
This small, 1,200 square meter site lies on the eastern slopes of an upland
divide, at the junction of a pipeline and a sendero cut, approximately 360 meters
southwest of 41MC360 and 170 meters northwest of 41MC359 on the same slopes.
Runoff from these slopes eventually feeds into a primary tributary that flows past a
number of prehistoric sites, beginning with 41AT75 and 41AT76 at its headwaters
through 41MC353 at its confluence with La Jarita Creek.
Vegetation is scattered mesquite and thorny brush, cacti, clump grass and
forbes. The Fashing clay topsoils (Soil Conservation Service 1980) are shallow and
were cracked from dryness. Sheetwash exposures dot the site and the sendero and
pipeline cuts have accelerated erosion, greatly affecting the integrity of this campsite.
Surface cultural material is sparse, limited to four chert tertiary flakes, three
pieces of burned rock and a probable dart point distal fragment. Two shovel probes
uncovered one piece of burned rock, five centimeters below surface. Disturbances to
this small encampment have mixed and redeposited the cultural debris. The probable
dart point tip tenuously suggests an Archaic occupation.
41MC362
This small, 1,400 square meter site lies along the eastern terraces of La Jarita
Creek, within riparian vegetation characterized by mesquite, oak and grasses. A linear
remnant of the first terrace, formed by an overflow channel, forms a rise between the
channel and La Jarita Creek. Soils are mainly alluvial loamy clays of the Brundage
series (Soil Conservation Service 1980).
Cultural material was first observed along the dry channel bed and eroding from
the eastern part of the terrace remnant. A shovel probe on the western edge, just above
the modern floodplain, revealed cultural material to a depth of 55 centimeters, with a

Site Descriptions / 53
concentration between 10 and 15 centimeters. A second probe shaved the eastern
edge of the terrace remnant, exposing the outer edge of a hearth (Feature 1) at 10
centimeters. Feature 1 contained burned chert (5-8 cm in length), burned clay, mussel
shell, snail shell, flakes and a unidirectional chert core. Shovel probes indicate that the
remnant terrace contains a cultural strata buried 10 to 15 centimeters below the present
ground surface. Other artifactual materials, found eroding from the channel, include a
primary chert flake with initial dorsal cortex flake removals, 15 to 20 secondary and
tertiary chert flakes, a uniface probably used as a scraper, one thin stage and one thick
stage biface fragment and a utilized secondary chert flake. No temporal diagnostics
were found.
41MC363
41MC363 is a 225,000 square meter prehistoric occupation area on a lobe in the
upland margins bordering the La Jarita Creek drainage, approximately 100 meters to
the west. A portion of the site lies on the western crest, mid- and toe slopes that form
the valley margin, and extends onto the fossil floodplain.
Deep (50 cm – 1 m) gullies, exposing caliche substrates on the northwest and
southwest slopes, form the site boundaries. A north-south fenceline is the western study
area boundary. Artifacts observed beyond the fenceline indicate the site extends
beyond the arbitrary project bounds (Fig. 6).
Dense thorny brush grows along the lower slopes while the upper slopes and top
are slightly more open, with tall mesquite trees, cacti, thorny brush, grasses and forbes.
Two sendero cuts along the northwest crest slopes have enhanced surface exposure.
Scattered, thinly grassed areas offer fairly good ground surface visibility, but this
exposure of the underlying clay has accelerated sheetwash, with attendant redeposition
of cultural materials. The movement of artifacts by the natural shrink and swell of the
clay soils is illustrated by the landowner’s recovery of a complete (13-15 cm) biface
standing on end, protruding about five centimeters from a crack.
Although post-depositional factors have altered the distribution of cultural
material, their density indicates this area was heavily utilized by prehistoric groups.
Flakes and burned rock are unevenly scattered over the site surface, with areas along
the slopes devoid of artifacts. Four areas of concentration were recorded; three cluster
on the western crest and the fourth lies along the southwest toe slope and fossil
floodplain.
Areas 1 and 2, on the western crest within 40 meters of one another, are artifact
concentrations within an area of densely scattered burned rock. Mapped artifacts in
Area 1 include: one utilized secondary flake, one retouched secondary flake, one thick
stage biface, one dart point distal fragment, and one primary flake with dorsal flaking.
Area 2 artifacts include: one quartzite hammerstone, one thick stage biface of quartzite,
one uniface (circular scraper), one stemmed dart point and one distally beveled biface.

Site Descriptions / 55
Because of time constraints, Area 3, the largest and densest concentration, was
minimally assessed. Here flakes, burned rock, tools and cores lie amid stream gravels
on an erosional surface covering 12,000 square meters (100×120 m) of the toe slope.
Only three tools were mapped: a distally beveled biface, a uniface (side scraper), and a
split cobble blank.
Area 4 is a biface concentration 50 meters east of Area 2. Observed bifaces
include: two thin stage proximal fragments, two thin distal fragments, a complete thick
stage, a small thin stage (possibly an arrow point preform) and one triangular base.
Other artifacts mapped at the site include: two distally beveled unifaces, one thick stage
biface, two thin stage bifaces (one of petrified wood), two thin stage distal fragments,
one thin stage proximal fragment, two cortex backed choppers, three unifaces, two dart
points (one Bulverde-like, one untyped), one utilized secondary flake and one retouched
flake. Mussel shell fragments were also observed on the northwest crest. Except where
noted, chert was the lithic source material. Although one piece of unworked chalcedony
was collected from the site, no formal tools, flakes or cores of this material were noted.
Two probes into the upper area of the site found burned rock to ten centimeters in dry
cracking clay. Temporal diagnostics suggest predominantly Middle Archaic
occupation(s) with a possible Late Prehistoric component.
41MC364
This 320,000 square meter site lies along the northern valley margins of a heavily
occupied lobe, east of 41MC363 and north of 41MC106. 41MC364 overlooks a primary
tributary of La Jarita Creek; the confluence is 600 meters west of the site. The site area
includes the Buck Mespero house, a 1940s structure, to the south, and a portion of
open pasture to the west. Vegetation varies from dense blackbrush and thorny brush
along the lower, and in some cases upper, slopes to more open mesquite, grasses and
prickly pear along the midslopes and top. Thick grasses prevail in the pasture. Erosion
along the western slopes has been severe – gullies have cut into the already cracked
clays, redepositing gravels. Tools, flakes and occasional burned rocks lie amid these
gravels and are unevenly scattered across the site surface.
Shovel probes located two pieces of burned rock at 15 centimeters below
present ground surface. Surface material consisted primarily of secondary and tertiary
chert flakes with some palmwood, and burned rock. Due to time constraints, only five
tools were recorded. One of these, a Folsom basal fragment, was part of the
landowner’s collection, reportedly from this site. The other four are a thin biface
fragment, a distally beveled biface (Nueces tool), a triangular dart point of petrified
wood, and a uniface. All material was chert except where otherwise noted. Site
occupation(s) may have occurred during the Paleoindian and Archaic periods, although
the origin of the Folsom fragment is problematic.
41MC365
This relatively small site covers 7,600 square meters of valley margin 50 meters
west of Hog Creek. The western fence bounding the study area runs north-south

56 / San Miguel Prospect
through the site. Surface observations indicate the cultural scatter probably extends
beyond the fence onto neighboring inaccessible property.
The site lies amid open prickly pear flats, with scattered mesquite and brush
increasing radically towards Hog Creek. The soils are highly saline, calcareous clays of
the Monteola series (Soil Conservation Service 1980), containing pebble size stream
gravels, noticeably rilled in areas where grasses are sparse. Open, exposed clay
surfaces exhibit sheetwash and cracking.
A sparse scatter of chert tertiary and secondary flakes and a few pieces of
burned rock was exposed on the surface. Only two formal artifacts, a thick stage biface
and a uniface, both chert, were recorded and mapped. Although minimal cultural
material is present, it is likely more exists further west atop the upland margin crests
that border the valley. Large, reoccupied areas, such as 41MC341, 41MC363 and
41MC106, demonstrate extensive utilization of this topographic zone and the probability
that this density is mirrored along the western margin crest of 41MC365 is high.
41MC366
The flat ground surface at this site is exposed, very light colored, fine sandy
loams with scattered clump grasses and prickly pear. Sprayed mesquite and thick brush
border the area on the northwest and southeast. The 20,000 square meters of site area
lie on the valley floor between Hog Branch to the northwest and a primary tributary of La
Jarita Creek to the southeast. The confluence of the three is approximately 360 meters
southwest of the site. Cultural debris was exposed on heavily sheetwashed surfaces
where vegetation is minimal. The ground was dry and cracked at the time of survey but
an ephemeral water depression covers most of the site area.
The light and uneven scatter of secondary and tertiary flakes and minimal burned
rock is confined to the interior and fringes of the depression. Mapped cultural material,
although not concentrated in any specific area, was found mostly along the southeast
boundary. The mapped artifacts, running linearly from northeast to southwest, include
two utilized flakes, a thin stage proximal biface fragment, one reworked Andice dart
point, a thin stage biface basal fragment, a Matamoros dart point and a uniface. Other
artifacts at the site include a long (2.1 cm) dart point stem fragment, a distally beveled
uniface and a possible arrow point perform. All material is chert unless otherwise stated.
A shovel probe into the northwest area found no cultural material in 40
centimeters of soil. As at 41MC365, pebble-size stream gravels were observed on
certain areas of the surface, mostly near the western study area boundary fenceline.
Temporal diagnostics suggest Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The reworked
Andice point could imply an Early Archaic component or convenient reuse of a finished
tool. A possible arrow point preform is indicative of Late Prehistoric occupation.

Site Descriptions / 57
41MC367
41MC367 is the largest in a series of sites along the upland margins that border
Hog and La Jarita creeks. Occupying 330,000 square meters, the site encompasses the
southwest lobe of a divide between Hog Creek on the west and a primary tributary of La
Jarita Creek on the east. The confluence lies 960 meters southwest of the site
boundary.
Thick grasses, large mesquite, prickly pear and other cacti form a moderately
dense vegetational cover over the upper elevations while blackbrush/thorny brush
vegetation dominates the slopes. Numerous deep gullies have cut into the topsoils and
caliche substrates along the western slopes. Caliche has been exposed by sheetwash
along the upper slopes. Atop the slope on the mesquite grasslands, the erosion
becomes less apparent as ground surface visibility decreases. The southeast slopes
are more gradual and therefore display less gullying but more sheetwash.
Several primary, as well as secondary and tertiary chert flakes, form the bulk of
scattered debris which, along with burned rocks (5-10 cm length), are concentrated
along the western side of the site. To the east and southeast, the material scatter
becomes noticeably thinner and sporadic. The many gullies along the western slopes
have exposed quantities of cultural material and subjected exposed debris to downslope
redeposition. The five centimeters of topsoil remaining in the gully walls hold thick stage
bifaces, unifaces, distally beveled bifaces and unifaces, utilized flakes, multidirectional,
bidirectional and unidirectional cores, and tested cobbles. Chert cobbles noted on the
surface are larger (10-15 cm length) than those pebble size gravels found on the valley
floors. Except for several palmwood flakes and a palmwood dart fragment, most cultural
material is chert. Mapped artifacts are mainly from the western area and include one
Frio dart point, two dart point stem fragments (one petrified wood, contracting), one
bidirectional core, three unifaces (one scraper, one graver/scraper, one made on a split
cobble), one split cobble blank, one distally beveled uniface and two distally beveled
bifaces, one utilized tertiary flake and one heavily patinated historic bottle base with a
raised “S” on the bottom.
Although only one temporal diagnostic from the Late Archaic has been identified,
occupations during other time periods are suggested by the extensive nature of the site
and supported by temporal diagnostics recovered by collectors. Time constraints
necessitated a more rapid recording of this site than others, and no shovel probes were
attempted during the survey phase.

58 / San Miguel Prospect
Reassessed Sites
41MC101
This site was initially recorded in October 1974 during the first archeological
survey of the prospect (Shafer and Baxter 1975). Site size at that time was established
at 40 by 20 yards, or 36 by 18 meters. The site, in an open pasture, was described as “a
light concentration of lithic debris scattered along the side of a low rise” (Shafer and
Baxter 1975:31) and classified as a multiple function site on an upland margin along La
Jarita Creek (Shafer and Baxter 1975:76). Artifacts collected at that time included two
cores, three soft hammer interior flakes, three hard hammer primary cortex, nine
secondary cortex and nine interior flakes, one biface fragment (hard hammer), one
gouge fragment and a dart point distal fragment. The site was re-recorded and reevaluated during the present survey. The results indicate a larger area measuring 190
by 120 meters. The disparity in size is probably in part the result of continued plowing
and erosion over the past 10 years.
At the time of recording, the soils had recently been turned so that surface
observations were extremely limited; the surface was a mass of large blocky clays (Fig.
5b). An uneven scatter of flakes and burned rock was spread over the surface, but no
artifacts were observed during recording. No artifacts were collected or mapped during
re-recording. No temporal diagnostics were found during either survey, and no
assessment of periods of occupation can be made.
41MC102
The site runs along the terrace above the modern floodplain, paralleling La Jarita
Creek (Fig. 7). When initially recorded in October 1974 (Shafer and Baxter 1975), site
size was estimated at 80 by 50 yards, or 73 by 46 meters. Re-investigation revealed
additional cultural debris scattered to the northwest and southwest and the current size
estimate is 685 by 300 meters. The side is bisected by a county road and includes the
remnants of an historic component once the Burmeister Ranch headquarters.
Prehistoric Component
Vegetation is a dense riparian overstory of oak, mesquite and other trees with
dense grasses on the terraces. On the valley floor, clump grasses, prickly pear,
scattered thorny brush and mesquite are present on the open, cleared surfaces. The
area of the site south of an old county road has been recently cleared. Linear piles of
bulldozed vegetation line the upper terraces about 70 meters northeast of the creek. A
20 to 30 meter wide swath was left along the lower terraces, between the 276' and 278'
elevation contour lines. Subsequent erosion has exposed cultural debris on the surface.
Shafer and Baxter (1975) classified 41MC102 as a multifunctional La Jarita
valley site. Artifacts collected included five cores, two soft hammer secondary cortex
flakes, five hard hammer primary cortex flakes, five secondary cortex flakes, one interior
flake and a soft hammer produced biface fragment (Shafer and Baxter 1975:31). This

Site Descriptions / 59

60 / San Miguel Prospect
assemblage was expanded during reassessment, and 36 more artifacts were mapped
and/or collected for further analysis. Also, seven areas of concentrated cultural debris
and two features were mapped amid an uneven scatter of flakes and burned rock that
span the terraces.
Five concentrations of flakes and burned rock were isolated amid the exposed
scatter. Ranging from five to ten meters in size, all are confined to exposed surfaces
that run the length of the southern area. Feature 1 was also exposed on the surface, a
20 by 20 centimeter area where 10 to 20 burned bone fragments, a utilized flake, two
tertiary flakes and a piece of burned rock lay in a tight cluster. Investigative troweling
indicates 3 to 5 centimeters of burned clay below the bone, possibly a pit. The bone was
collected for analysis since disturbance of the recently exposed feature was likely in the
near future. Since no diagnostic features were present, the bone could not be identified.
Shovel probes indicate subsurface cultural deposits between 40 and 60
centimeters deep along the lower terrace just above the present floodplain, and very
limited deposits on the upper terrace (278' contour). The cursory subsurface
assessment indicates buried deposits along alluvial terraces. A probe at the northern
extremity, along the lower terrace approximately 25 meters east of the creek, showed
12 tertiary chert flakes, one chert secondary flake and three pieces of burned rock at 0
to 20 centimeters below surface. A second probe 25 meters northwest of the house, at
the 280' contour found two chert flakes and a piece of burned rock at 0 to 20
centimeters and four tertiary flakes at 20 to 30 centimeters. Approximately 50 meters
east of the house, where surface artifacts were found in concentration, two chert tertiary
flakes and one chert secondary flake were unearthed between 20 and 40 centimeters
below the surface.
Two areas of artifact concentration were mapped: Area 1 on the eastern central
edge of the site and Area 2 where the old county road cuts the first terrace. Area 2 is a
heavily eroded, 30 by 15 meter area of chert flakes, tools and burned rock along the
margins of the road. Mapped artifacts from this area include one unidirectional core, one
uniface, one triangular dart point with tip missing, four thin biface proximal fragments
and one thin biface. Area 1 covers 10 by 10 meters, approximately 70 meters eastsoutheast of the house and within the original 1974 (TARL files) site boundary. Only two
artifacts, a split cobble blank and a multidirectional core, were mapped in an area of
flakes and burned rock. Artifacts about 20 to 25 meters to the northwest of Area 1
include a trimmed flake, chopper (petrified wood), two thick stage bifaces, one thin
stage biface, one split cobble blank and a ground stone fragment. Other artifacts
scattered about the site include one sandy paste bone-tempered sherd, one uniface,
one trimmed flake, one thin stage biface proximal fragment, two thin stage bifaces, one
thick stage biface, two triangular dart points, one Abasolo dart point with tip missing,
one multidirectional core, one distally beveled biface and one trimmed flake.
Unprovenienced material includes one uniface, one secondary flake, one thick stage
biface, one core fragment, one multidirectional core, and one triangular dart point base.
Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations are suggested by the diagnostics.

Site Descriptions / 61
Feature 2, a 5 by 5 meter burned rock concentration, lies 10 meters northeast of
Area 2. This hearth remnant is eroding from an old cow trail that lies on the northeast
margin of the old road. Historic debris, mostly glass and ceramics, overlies the surface
in the area of Feature 2, Area 2 and the house site. Including cultivated fields and
general use areas, the historic component overlies most of the site area.
Historic Component
The historic component, the only recordable historic site in the project area, is
that of a former dwelling of rectangular plan now in ruins. Present are construction
materials of logs, milled wood, stone and brick indicative of several separate
construction episodes. Roofing material of metal with nail washers is present. Marked
brick (Standard and D’Hanis), pointing to early twentieth century origin at best, are
mixed with some unmarked wire cut brick which appears to be more recent. The
fireplace base is of stone, yet a single firebrick of recent, out-of-state manufacture is
present. Artifacts observable at the surface (glass, ceramics, horse harness parts) are
turn of the century in age.
Additional debris, including construction materials, are a paced 30 meters to the
north of the house ruins. The distribution of structural remains was compared to a series
of aerial photographs taken in 1946 (Texas Natural Resources Information System
200606:DEQ7-75-561). These photos show the currently ruined building, apparently
standing at that time, clearly depicting its roof ridgeline. Immediately to the north can be
seen an additional structure, not now standing, in the vicinity of the above-mentioned
debris.
These scattered remains are the now-leveled Burmeister Ranch headquarters,
built in 1902 by prominent McMullen-Atascosa county lawyer, rancher and politician,
Frank Burmeister and his wife, Sarah. When recorded during this survey, the homesite
had been virtually destroyed, the collapsed house and outbuildings dispersed by
apparent bulldozing and later root plowing. In 1946, only two buildings still stood. The
potential for archeological recovery of information relevant to interpreting this house site
seemed minimal so local sources were sought. Gustave “Butch” Burmeister, the
youngest son of Frank and Sarah, grew to manhood on this ranch. His book Life on
Lajarita describes virtually every aspect of the ranch, its environs and associated
communal activities and is the source for much of the family history and ranch
reconstruction outlined in the later chapter on historic resources. In addition, he
furnished photographs and additional details in correspondence on file at TARL.
41MC103
41MC103, recorded during the first lignite survey, was classified as a limited
function site with a thin lithic scatter in the La Jarita valley (Shafer and Baxter 1975:31,
76). Site size was estimated at 50 by 100 yards (46x92 m). Artifacts initially collected
from the surface include 11 cores, 89 flakes – three soft hammer secondary cortex, five
interior, 12 hard hammer cortex, 37 secondary cortex and 32 interior flakes, as well as
one gouge fragment (Shafer and Baxter 1975:31). Additional surface collection was

62/San Miguel Project
recommended in this preliminary report. As a result of the present re-assessment, the
site limits have been extended to include a more diverse artifact assemblage covering a
96,000 square meter area.
41MC103 lies in a fallow sandy field wedged between two primary tributaries on
the east and west. Each tributary flows south into La Jarita Creek and their confluence
forms the southern site boundary. Vegetation is limited to meter-high sunflowers in the
open field and riparian growth fringing the two tributaries. Soils are alluvial Brundage
series (Soil Conservation Service 1980) fine sandy loam to clay loam.
Four areas of concentration were defined for the site. The major area,
approximately 100 meters north of the confluence, contains burned rock, tools, cores
and flakes in a 45 by 15 meter area along the southern edge of the field and north of a
gas well access road. Mapped and collected material from this concentration include
two unidirectional cores, one multidirectional core, one distally beveled biface (Nueces
tool), one grooved and smoothed conch columella, one utilized flake and a uniface with
use wear, plus dense burned rock and flakes. The other three areas of concentration
are: 1) a 15 by 30 meter flake scatter with a biface fragment on the northern site
boundary, 2) a 20 by 20 meter flake concentration in a sheetwash area bordering the
tributary (130 m northwest of the largest concentration), and 3) a 10 by 10 meter burned
rock concentration at site center. Other dispersed artifacts include one thin stage
proximal biface fragment, two bidirectional cores, two unidirectional cores, one
lanceolate point basal fragment (Angostura), one triangular dart point with tip missing,
one biface fragment and one core/chopper tool. Subsurface probes indicate buried
cultural material, mostly burned rock, between 15 and 40 centimeters in the major
concentration area only. Probes were terminated when hard packed clays were
encountered.
Plowing, road construction and subsequent erosion have greatly altered the
original deposition of cultural materials. The major concentration may be the displaced
accumulation of various encampments at a preferred locality. The remaining three
concentrations could be exposed campsites, but subsurface data indicates only a
surficial context. Possibly these areas are the result of continued plowing and erosion.
The site occupation(s) could have occurred anytime during the Archaic and possibly
Paleoindian period.
41MC104 A and B
Initially recorded in 1974 (TARL files) and reported by Shafer and Baxter (1975),
41MC104 was estimated to be about 40 by 75 yards (36 x 68 m). The site was
described as “…a scattering of lithic material on a rise bordering La Jarita Creek”
(Shafer and Baxter 1975:31). Based on the variety of tools, 41MC104 was classified as
a multiple function site (Shafer and Baxter 1975:77). The artifacts collected at that time
include 7 cores, 64 flakes, 1 hard hammer (Group 2) biface, 1 (Group 1) gouge, 1 end
scraper, and 1 dart point fragment. All material is assumed to be chert unless otherwise
specified.

Site Descriptions/63
Apparently only a portion of the site was exposed at the time of initial recording.
Upon re-evaluation, the site was found to be much larger, with a more varied artifact
assemblage than previously documented. To more efficiently record this large site, a
wide, shallow, north-south gully was used to divide the site into areas A and B. Artifacts
are fewer in Area A, but more concentrated than in Area B. Area A, the smaller of the
two, begins on the terrace above the present floodplain along La Jarita Creek. The
western boundary of Area B (the gully) is 182 meters east of the creek. Both areas are
in open flats with scattered mesquite, clump grasses and prickly pear. These flats were
purportedly used for improved pasture in historic times. A dense riparian community
fringes the creek and tributary on the north side of the site.
Most of the site surface is open, exposed soil. Sheetwash and erosional gullies
have exposed cultural material in both areas. Several large depressions that once
contained water were mapped in both Area A and Area B.
Area A
Area A consists of an uneven surficial scatter of flakes and burned rock covering
8,500 square meters on an isolated and elevated terrace above the present floodplain.
A portion of the study area fence runs east-west through the south part of Area A. The
site probably extends onto the property south of the fence, but inaccessibility limited
observations to what can be seen from the fence.
Two areas of concentrated tools, flakes and burned rock were mapped at the
site. Flakes are mostly secondary and tertiary; burned rock measured from 5 millimeters
to 5 centimeters. One concentration, exposed in a gully along the south fenceline,
contains flakes, burned rock, two thin stage biface fragments and a tested cobble. In the
other concentration, 10 meters north of the first, flakes, burned rock, two bifaces,
worked secondary flakes and a multidirectional core were mapped in a sheetwash area.
Most of the other artifacts lie in the northwest portion of the site, a 60 by 20 meter area.
These include a unidirectional core, two bifacially worked large secondary flakes, one
Gower-like dart point basal fragment, one dart point blade fragment and a thin stage
biface. Shovel probes revealed two pieces of burned rock at 0 to 10 centimeters depth
in a terrace east of the present floodplain, and a chert flake between 20 and 40
centimeters, 20 meters east of the terrace probe. Most of Area A is surficial with minimal
indications of subsurface deposits.
Area B
Area B, a 38,700 square meter area on the eastern upper terraces of La Jarita
Creek, is bisected by a north-south linear catchment depression. On the north part of
the catchment, an area of approximately 1,400 square meters, artifacts have been
exposed by sheetwash. Flakes and burned rock are unevenly spread over Area B, but
are more observable in this northern area where erosion has left a heavily deflated
island of sorts with cultural debris on its surface. Here, flakes, burned rock, one utilized
flake, a distally beveled tool, a battered cobble and a thin stage biface were found in a
30 by 30 meter area. On the northeast site boundaries, two 10 by 10 meter

64 / San Miguel Prospect
concentrations of burned rock suggest probable hearths. Only a few flakes and two core
fragments were in the general vicinity of the burned rock. Two other artifacts, a utilized
flake and a bifacially worked flake, were in this area east of the catchment, which is the
furthest from the creek. The land here exemplifies the open pasture of the area, with
fewer open sheetwash exposures. A shovel probe found no cultural material to 40
centimeters.
The majority of mapped artifacts lie west of the catchment gully. Here the scatter
is unevenly distributed over 20,000 square meters, with mapped artifacts clustering
along the eastern edge of the drainage/gully boundary between areas A and B and
along the southeast edge of the northern catchment. Artifacts along the boundary
include two core fragments, one thin stage biface fragment, one core and an untyped
dart point fragment with the distal portion and most of the stem missing. A probe near
the two core fragments found two flakes and an equal number of burned rocks (5-10 cm
in length) between 0 and 20 centimeters in a 60 centimeter deep probe.
Artifacts fringing on the southeast edge of the catchment include an apparently
unfinished arrow point with tip missing (resembling a Perdiz), a thin stage biface
proximal fragment, a thin stage biface fragment, a thin stage biface medial fragment
core chopper, a uniface (scraper) and a bifacially worked secondary flake. A probe into
the area around the arrow point found cultural material – three tertiary flakes and one
chip – confined to the upper 20 centimeters in a 60 centimeter deep hole. One piece of
mussel shell was also observed at the site. All utilized raw material is chert. Temporal
diagnostics suggest occupations during the Early Archaic and Late Prehistoric with
probable encampments in the interim. Distribution of the temporal markers suggest
earlier encampments were closer to La Jarita Creek.
41MC105
This site was first recorded during the Texas A&M survey of the San Miguel
Lignite Prospect. The site was described as a “light concentration of flakes along a lobe
above a tributary branch of La Jarita Creek (Shafer and Baxter 1975:32). The site,
estimated at 30 by 50 yards (27 x 45 m), was situated in open pasture land. Collected
artifacts included 5 cores, 1 soft hammer secondary cortex and 6 interior flakes, 2 hard
hammer primary cortex, 13 secondary cortex and 11 interior flakes as well as 1 biface
fragment (soft hammer), 1 gouge and 1 dart point distal fragment. Based on the variety
of tools, it was designated a multiple function site (Shafer and Baxter 1975:32).
Today the site encompasses an estimated 2,250 square meter area on the
eastern valley margins of La Jarita Creek. The 1975 physiographic designation was
upland margin. The site lies in open pasture land that, at the time of recording, had
been turned for cultivation. As a result, large blocks of clay have obscured the surface
and very few artifacts were observed. The present site boundaries are based, in part, on
1975 estimates and on the few flakes observed during re-assessment survey walkover.
With continued plowing over the past ten years, the site area has been subjected to
extensive redeposition. Initially a light scatter, the few artifacts have apparently been

Site Descriptions / 65
displaced by disturbance. Therefore, the initial site surface collection will remain as the
total artifact inventory.
41MC106
Sites 41MC124 and 41MC125 were recorded on the western mid and toe slopes
bordering 41MC106 (TARL files). As a result of the recent reassessment, the artifacts at
41MC124 and 41MC125 were found to be part of the overall scatter associated with
41MC106; therefore these two sites are now included with 41MC106. As originally
recorded, 41MC106 was estimated at 250 by 70 yards (228 x 68 m) or “along the
contour slope of the hill” (TARL files), thereby giving it a horseshoe shape along the
west, south and east slopes. The site was described as “…a heavy concentration of
flakes and lithic debris along the slope of a large hill. Raw lithic supply on the crest of
the knoll. The main concentrations of worked material occur in a zone half way down
the slope and thin out at lower elevations” (Shafer and Baxter 1975:32). Materials
collected from the surface include 19 cores, 5 soft hammer primary cortex, 53
secondary cortex and 52 interior flakes; 10 hard hammer primary cortex, 35 secondary
cortex and 31 interior flakes as well as 1 triangular dart point, 2 gouge fragments, 3 hard
hammer bifaces, 2 hard hammer biface fragments and 3 unifaces. Additional surface
collection was recommended as a mitigative measure.
Sites 41MC124 and 41MC125 are found on the western toe and mid-slopes
respectively. 41MC124 was listed as having “a few flakes and burned rocks along the
lower slopes of a hill beside La Jarita Creek” in a 30 by 40 yard (27 x 36 m) area
(Shafer and Baxter 1975:38). Collected materials included a palmwood point fragment,
two cores, one hard hammer secondary cortex and one interior flake. 41MC125 was
described as “a small area of flakes and burned rock near site 41MC106. Site has been
disturbed by the construction of Highway 791” (Shafer and Baxter 1975:38). Site area
was estimated at 30 by 40 yards (27 x 18 m). Collected material included two cores,
one soft hammer secondary cortex and six interior flakes, two hard hammer primary
cortex, three secondary cortex and six interior flakes, plus one hard hammer produced
biface and one soft hammer produced biface fragment. All of the above sites are
located in open pastures.
Upon further inspection of the artifact distribution at 41MC106, it was found that
the 1975 estimates were fairly accurate but the extent of cultural debris was greater.
Though the majority of artifacts ring the mid-slopes in a horseshoe configuration, some
are found atop the lobe and further north across FM 791. The site occupies a 537,600
square meter area of a divide lobe that is also occupied by 41MC363 to the northwest
and 41MC364 to the north. La Jarita Creek lies 450 meters to the west and 41MC102
begins approximately 50 meters southwest of the site. A north-south fenceline bisects
the site – Mespero lands lie to the west and Rays land to the east. The northern portion
of the site is traversed by FM 791.
On the Mespero property, vegetation is mostly scattered clump grasses, prickly
pear, other cacti and mesquite. At the time of recording, part of the Rays’ property had
been turned for future cultivation, and a part was covered by tall corn stalks.

66 / San Miguel Prospect
The soils are calcareous clay with high shrink/swell characteristics. The blocky,
turned soils on the Rays’ property and the wide, deep cracks in the surface of the
Mespero property attest to the dynamic nature of these soils. They further substantiate
the high degree of post-depositional disturbance that has taken place throughout the
centuries, from soil dynamics and erosion. Erosion is most apparent on the western
midslopes where artifacts are strewn in open sheetwash areas. Two contiguous
concentrations of burned rock, flakes, tools and cores encompass 33,600 square
meters on the western to southern slopes. Although the majority are secondary and
tertiary, several primary flakes were observed in the concentrations.
Artifacts collected from the concentrations include two tested pieces of
chalcedony, one thick stage biface, one triangular dart point without tip, two dart point
proximal fragments, one thin stage biface (quartzite), one distally beveled biface, two
unifaces (scrapers), one utilized flake and one trimmed flake. Raw material is chert
unless otherwise stated. The raw material source lies amid scattered stream gravels on
the slopes. Cherts range in size from pebbles to 10 to 15 centimeter cobbles. Quartzite
and chalcedony occur only sporadically. Cultural material, mostly tertiary flakes, is
variably scattered over the upper areas of the site. The turned field exhibited nothing in
the way of observable cultural debris. Based on artifact variability, the site appears to
have been utilized for multiple resource procurement. Site occupations are hard to
determine since only untyped dart points were found on the surface: these suggest
Archaic encampment.
41MC107
Initially recorded in 1974, the site was described as a “light concentration of
scattered flakes on an eroded ridge slope near a tributary branch” (Shafer and Baxter
1975:32). Estimated at 30 by 20 yards (27 x 18 m), surface observations indicated only
a very limited artifact scatter. Collected artifacts included four cores, two hard hammer
primary cortex flakes, three secondary cortex flakes, three interior flakes, one gouge
and one dart point (Shafer and Baxter 1975:32). Based on the artifacts present, the site
was defined as a resource procurement area where encampments may have been
short term, suggesting definite but limited use of the resource realm. The re-evaluation
of 41MC107 closely approximated the original assessment of cultural use but with
several added details.
The site lies along the southwest margin slopes off the southern lobe of the
upland divide separating the La Jarita Creek and Salt Branch valleys. As with many
sites along the margins of this divide (41MC356, 41MC357, 41MC358), 41MC107 is
considered a partial exposure of a larger site that extends onto inaccessible property.
Isolated material found on the north side of FM 791 along the eastern study area
boundary indicates a continuation of site debris. The visible portions of this site lie in
uncleared, moderately dense mesquite brush along the southwest slopes and in a
cleared grassy pasture paralleling the eastern side of a north-south ranch road.
Shrink/swell clays cover the surface.

Site Descriptions / 67
Two areas of concentrations were mapped amid the light scatter of artifacts
unevenly distributed over the slopes. These areas contain light concentrations of flakes,
burned rock and several tools. The lower, southwest slope (Area 1) contained a light but
concentrated scatter of chert secondary and tertiary flakes, scattered burned rock
fragments, a dart point and a thick stage biface that appears to have been used as a
graver. The slopes have been heavily affected by gully and sheetwash erosion, and this
area may be the result of accumulation from down slope wash. The other area, Area 2,
at approximately the same elevation but 60 meters southeast, contains a light scatter of
flakes, burned rock fragments and biface fragments. Most of these artifacts were found
near bulldozer piles, the result of road clearing.
Area 2 covers approximately 400 square meters. Area 1 approximately 6,000.
Both lie within a total recorded site area of 68,000 square meters. Area 1 closely
approximates the original 1974 site area. The two areas may represent exposed in situ
encampments but, judging from the sheetwashed/gullied slopes and bulldozer activity,
this is unlikely. Based on the presence of a Uvalde dart point, one site occupation can
be assigned to the Early Archaic Period.
41MC108
41MC108, first recorded in 1974, was described as “flakes and burned rock
scattered along an eroded ridge slope and onto the foot of the slope in light to medium
concentrations within a quarter mile of semipermanent water supply” (Shafer and Baxter
1973:32). Four cores, two soft hammer secondary cortex and four interior flakes, four
hard hammer primary cortex flakes, seven secondary cortex flakes, fourteen interior
flakes, two hard hammer produced bifaces, one hard hammer biface fragment, one soft
hammer biface fragment and one gouge fragment were collected (Shafer and Baxter
1975:32). Based on this varied assemblage, the site was classified as a multiple
function area in the uplands (Shafer and Baxter 1975:77). No dimensions were given
but the plotting of the site on topographic quads (TARL Files) indicates a long, linear
site along the toe slopes (Fig. 8). Although some scattered cultural material was found
atop the lobe of the upland basin divide, the majority lies along the western slopes with
density increasing downslope.
Sheetwash and gullies eroding the thin, 5 to 10 centimeter clay mantle along the
toe slopes have exposed the underlying caliche substrates. A very large (115,000 sq.
m) area of exposed caliche/shales on the flats was barren of cultural material but it
attests to the massive erosion characteristic of these uplands. Vegetation varies from
scattered blackbrush, grasses and cacti on the flats to dense mesquite and thorny brush
along a dammed tributary 500 meters west of the site. Slope vegetation, moderately
dense mesquite and thorny brush with grassy surfaces broken by prickly pear and other
cacti, thins along the eroded toe where cultural debris was concentrated.
A fairly contiguous ground scatter of cultural debris stretches approximately 200
meters north-south along the toe slopes. A dense array of flakes, burned rock and tools
lie within the thin clay mantle and on the exposed caliche substrates bordering the toe.
Debitage is primarily tertiary flakes with several secondary and primary flakes. The most

68 / San Miguel Prospect

Figure 8. 41MC108 site map.

Site Descriptions / 69
popular lithic raw material is chert with secondary quantities of palmwood and
chalcedony.
Thirty-two chalcedony flakes, two arrow point preforms and one serrated arrow
point broken at midstem were concentrated in a 2 by 4 meter area on the remnant clay
mantle of the toe slope. Based on the single raw material type and the several stages of
manufacture represented, this area retains the characteristics of a flaking station.
A second concentration, a 20 by 30 meter dense scatter of chert and palmwood
flakes, tools and burned rock was observed on the caliche surface and eroding from the
clays at the interface of caliche/clay exposure (Fig. 5C). A uniface scraper and a thin
stage biface of chalcedony were mapped but shovel probes found no cultural material in
the ten centimeters of remnant clay of Area 1.
Twenty meters northeast, a thick stage chert biface was found on the caliche.
Approximately 100 meters further northeast, a group of artifacts exposed on the caliche
included a triangular dart point proximal fragment, a thick stage biface, a thick stage
biface fragment, a thin biface distal fragment, a thin stage petrified wood biface and a
unidirectional core. Another group of artifacts, 140 meters southwest of Area 1 and on
the mid-slope, includes an untyped stemless dart point, a thick stage petrified wood
biface and a thick stage biface. South of this group by 25 meters, another group lies
lower on the slope. This group includes a core-chopper, a Catan dart point and a
uniface. Other artifacts scattered on the south-southwest slope include a Refugio-like
dart point, a thin stage biface, and a uniface with probable use as a spokeshave. One
other artifact, an exhausted core, was found on the caliche flats 80 meters southsouthwest of Area 1.
Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations are suggested by the presence of dart
points and arrow points. The duration of these occupations is conjectural based on tool
density and frequency. Exploitation of various lithic raw materials is apparent from tools
and flakes of chalcedony, chert, palmwood and petrified wood. The complete stage
sequence of manufacture at the proposed flaking station indicates total lithic reduction
took place at the site in addition to varied domestic activities.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
In the San Miguel Prospect area, thousands of years of cultural debris, mainly
lithic materials, have been exposed on the surface by erosion. The various
assemblages represented by these materials have been thoroughly mixed, thus
obscuring discrete lithic technologies. Cognizant of the lack of temporal control, a broad
collection strategy was employed in an attempt to discover areal trends and functional
interpretations of the tool kit used at these sites. The 426 artifacts were recovered from
surface contexts with approximate locational coordinates plotted on detailed site maps.
A collection methodology was devised to yield the most information while not totally
taxing the laboratory time allotted for this project. All observed projectile points and
gouges (distally beveled bifaces and unifaces) were collected, while only a sample of
the other lithic categories present at a site were selected. The San Miguel Project area
encompasses approximately 5,500 acres of upland topography. The majority of the
sites are highly deflated, mixing artifacts from several occupations on a single surface.
In addition, the area has attracted the attention of relic hunters for decades. Several
local collections were examined in the course of the survey. Many of the artifacts were
acquired from the present project area. Thus, in the following discussion the prehistoric
lithic materials are treated as a single sample from this type of South Texas
environment.
LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Lithic materials recovered during the intensive archeological survey for the San
Miguel Lignite Project are organized into eleven categories for descriptive purposes and
analysis; categories include cores, thick bifaces, thin bifaces, distally beveled bifaces
and unifaces, unifaces, trimmed flakes, utilized debitage, hammerstones, ground stone,
debitage and miscellaneous lithic artifacts and materials. Provenience information is
provided in Table 2, and metric data for all collected artifacts was tabulated and is
curated with the specimens at TARL. All of these, except utilized debitage, are the
categories which were used in the Phase I lithic analysis of Choke Canyon materials
(Hall, Black and Graves 1982). The Choke Canyon lithic typology was used in order to
fit the current data into a previously established areal framework, allowing more viable
lithic comparisons between the two nearby project areas.
Some of the groups or subgroups (forms) within the Choke Canyon categories
are not represented in this artifact assemblage; this absence must be related to the
collection methodology used at this time. Additional groups and subgroups (forms) were
set up when artifacts did not fit within the established typology. The one new category is
utilized debitage, comprised of 17 utilized flakes and 1 utilized chunk. This category
separates modified or edge-worked flakes and flake fragments from the other debitage.
In the Choke Canyon analysis, this distinction was not made.

Type designations follow Suhm and Jelks (1962) or Turner and Hester (1985). All
artifact measurements are in centimeters (cm). Dimensions of incomplete specimens
were estimated when possible; extremely fragmented specimens were not measured.
Cores – 48 Specimens
Cores are the lithic raw material from which chipped stone tools are
manufactured. Most cores from this project area are stream-rolled cobbles that have
been tested (1-4 flake scars), partially used or exhausted. Large thick flakes that exhibit
two or more flake scars are also included in the core category. The cores are grouped
according to the directional striking preference, platform preparation and morphology,
size, shape and degree of reduction (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:250). The following
groups are used in this typology:
Group 1. Natural platform
Group 2. Bidirectional, natural and prepared platform
Group 3. Multidirectional, natural and prepared platforms, single and multiple
facets
Group 4. Unidirectional, prepared platform single facet
Group 5. Multidirectional, natural and prepared platforms, single facet
Group 6. Core nuclei (exhausted cores)
Group 7. Flat, circular to elliptical in outline, unifacially cortex covered
Group 8. Tested cobbles
Group 9. Core fragments
Group 10. Unmodified lithic material (cobbles, etc.)
Group 10 includes unmodified tabular samples of chalcedony and petrified wood,
as well as ummodified cobble samples, thus this group is slightly altered from Hall’s
(Hall, Black and Graves 1982) Group 10 – Unmodified Cobbles. Groups 1 through 5
were divided into Forms 1 or 2, with Form 2 referring to possible tools within each
group.
GROUP 1 (1 Specimen)
Form 2 – 1 Specimen
This cortex-covered chert cobble is roughly half-moon shaped and has had six
flakes removed, using four separate natural platforms (Fig. 9a). This core was flaked
multidirectionally and retains approximately 80 percent of the cortex. One platform for
two flake scars has been battered, possibly through use as a chopper. Four of the flake
scars are moderately to lightly patinated; this may mean the flakes were removed during
two temporally separate events.

76 / San Miguel Prospect
GROUP 2 (8 Specimens)
Form 1 – 1 Specimen; Form 2 – 7 Specimens
These cores have been flaked bidirectionally; that is, after initial flake removal
using a natural platform, the next flake is removed in the opposite direction using the
initial flake scar as the platform. The Form 1 specimen appears to have been annealed,
as it has been burned enough to alter the material. These specimens retain 40 to 70
percent of the cortex and all but one exhibit crushed edges, suggesting use as chopper
tools. All eight artifacts are cortex-covered cobbles, with the cortex on the side opposite
the manufactured core edge. One Formn 2 specimen is illustrated (Fig. 9b).
GROUP 3 (2 Specimens)
Form 1 – 1 Specimen; Form 2 – 1 Specimen
Group 3 cores have been flaked multidirectionally utilizing both natural and
prepared platforms with single and multiple facets. The Formn 1 specimen is a petrified
palmwood core that has been thermally altered. The Form 2 specimen is a chert cobble
with less than 10 percent cortex retained and a severely battered core edge (Fig. 9c).
GROUP 4 (4 Specimens)
Form 1 – 3 specimens; Form 2 – 1 Specimen
Group 4 cores have been unidirectionally flaked using a single facet, prepared
platform; flakes have been removed at approximately right angles to the prepared
platform. One Form 1 specimen is a petrified palmwood core, the other three are chert
cobble cores (Fig. 9d). The retained cortex on these specimens varies from less than 10
percent to 25 percent. The Form 2 specimen has edge wear from possible use as a
unifacial scraper (Fig. 9e).
GROUP 5 (7 Specimens)
Form 1 – 4 specimens; Form 2 – 3 Specimens
Group 5 cores have been multidirectionally flaked using single facet prepared
and natural platforms. This group differs from Group 3 in that only single facet prepared
platforms are included. Two specicmens are intentionally burned (annealed) petrified
palmwood cores; the other five are chert cobbles or flakes with 10 to 40 percent cortex
retained (Fig. 9f). The three Form 2 cores have crushed battered edges suggestive of a
chopping tool use (Fig. 9g).
Group 6 (2 Specimens)
Group 6 cores are core nuclei or exhausted cores that have been reduced to
such a small size that further reduction is nearly impossible. Both specimens are

Artifact Analysis / 77
petrified palmwood which appears to have been thermally altered. These cores are
much smaller than any in the other groups (Fig. 9h).
GROUP 7 (5 Specimens)
Group 7 cores are flat, circular to elliptical, and covered with cortex on one face.
Two specimens are split cobble flakes (Fig. 9i). One has been formed by flake removal
from a chert cobble. The other two specimens may have been either flakes or cobbles;
the ventral faces are heavily flaked, which has obscured the evidence for this
determination. All specimens are chert and from 30 to 100 percent cortex is retained on
the dorsal face of each. The ventral face of each has been farily extensively flaked. Two
of the cores have shapes which suggest use as scrapers, but the ventral flaking has
removed any possible edge wear. It is possible that these artifacts were used as
scrapers, then rejuvenated by ventral flaking.
GROUP 8 (5 Specimens)
Group 8 consists of cortex-covered cobbles and pebbles with one to four flakes
removed. Natural platforms were utilized on these specimens. These artifacts may have
been tested to determine material quality. Two are chert cobbles, two are chalcedony
chunks and one is a quartzite pebble.
GROUP 9 (4 Specimens)
Group 9 consists of core fragments that are otherwise unclassifiable. These
would appear to be the result of shattered cores. Two specimens are chert, one is
burned petrified palmwood and one is rhyolite.
GROUP 10 (10 Specimens)
This group consists of unmodified lithic materials which may have been
intentionally carried to the sites for reduction. The sample consists of four cortexcovered chert cobbles, four chalcedony chunks and two specimens of petrified wood.
Thick Bifaces – 20 Specimens
Thick bifaces in this typology are slightly different from those related in Hall (Hall,
Black and Graves 1982). For purposes of this analysis, thick bifaces are those which
measure 1.3 centimeters or more in thickness. Tools, other than distally beveled
bifaces, of this size are included in the thick biface category; Hall excluded tools from
the Choke Canyon thick biface category. These bifaces have been primarily percussion
flaked, although some pressure flaking is evident on several. The thick bifaces have
been separated into nine morphological groups as follows:
Group 1. Large, crudely flaked oval to elliptical
Group 2. Elliptical
Group 3. Oval to subcircular

78 / San Miguel Prospect
Group 4. Circular to subcircular
Group 5. Triangular
Group 6. Fragments with pointed ends
Form 1. elongate
Form 2. triangular
Group 7. Fragments with rounded ends
Form 1. subcircular to oval
Form 2. large broad thin fragments
Form 3. elliptical
Form 4. remnant cortex striking platforms
Group 8. Odd and miscellaneous
Form 1. whole
Form 2. fragments
Group 9. Lateral and medial fragments
Group 8, Form 1 in this typology is made up of two bifacial gravers with heavy
edge wear. These are the only edge-worn tools in the thick biface category. No Group 4
artifacts were recovered due to the select nature of the collection.
GROUP 1 (2 Specimens)
Group 1 thick bifaces are roughly oval to elliptical in outline; they are generally
the largest and thickest specimens in this category. Traces of cortex are retained on
both specimens (Fig. 10a).
GROUP 2 (3 Specimens)
Group 2 thick bifaces are more definitively elliptical in outline and have been
more carefully flaked than Group 1 specimens. Two specimens retain less than 25
percent of the cortex, while the other specimen retains none (Fig. 10b).
GROUP 3 (3 Specimens)
Specimens in this group are oval to subcircular in outline. Two specimens are
somewhat crudely chipped and retain less than 25 percent of the cortex. The other
specimen, roughly oval in outline, has been finely chipped into the shape of a knife.
Pressure flaking is evident along the thinnest edge but no use wear was found under
microscopic examination (Fig. 10c).
GROUP 5 (4 Specimens)
Group 5 specimens are roughly triangular in outline and in composite are
consistently thinner than any other group in the thick biface category. Two specimens
appear to be in a finished form, that of knives, but no edge use wear was discernible
(Fig. 10d). Both of these specimens have been pressure flaked. Only one specimen
retains a small amount of cortex.

80 / San Miguel Prospect
GROUP 6 (2 Specimens)
Form 1 – 2 Specimens
Group 6 specimens are bifacial fragments with pointed ends. Hall (Hall, Black
and Graves 1982) divided this group into two forms based on shape – elongate and
triangular. The San Miguel artifact sample did not include any Form 2 triangular shapes.
One of the specimens, manufactured from petrified wood, has the shape of a graver
(Fig. 10e). Unfortunately, because of the low grade quality of the material, no use wear
was discernible on the bit of this specimen.
GROUP 7 (2 Specimens)
Form 3 – 2 Specimens
Group 7 specimens are thick bifacial fragments with rounded ends. Hall (Hall,
Black and Graves 1982) divided this group into four forms – subcircular to oval, large
broad thin fragments, elliptical, and cortex striking platforms. This artifact sample had
only the Form 3 – elliptical shape present (Fig. 10f).
GROUP 8 (3 Specimens)
Form 1 – 2 specimens; Form 2 – 1 Specimen
This group differs somewhat from the Choke Canyon typology. Here, this group
has been subdivided into two forms – whole and fragmentary. The Form 1 (whole)
artifacts include thick bifaces that are complete but have odd or miscellaneous shapes.
Both Form 1 specimens are bifacially flaked gravers with heavy use wear evident along
the bits (Fig. 10g). The Form 2 specimen is a thick biface fragment that is too
incomplete for any other classification (Fig. 10h).
GROUP 9 (1 Specimen)
This group consists of fragments from either medial segments or lateral edges
from thick bifaces. The one specimen in this group is a biface overshot, classified as a
lateral fragment (Fig. 10j). This specimen is made of rhyolite.
THIN BIFACES – 156 Specimens
Thin bifaces in this typology are less than 1.3 centimeters thick. The large
majority have no cortex retained, have been fashioned into their present shapes
predominantly with pressure flaking, and have relatively straight, smoothed edges.
Approximately one-third of the thin bifaces are stemmed. Tool types represented within
this category include lanceolate points, dart points, arrow points, knives, spokeshaves,
drills/perforators and preforms of these tool types. Hall (Hall, Black and Graves 1982)
divided the thin bifaces from Choke Canyon into ten morphologically distinct groups. For
purposes of this study, two groups have been added to the list: lanceolate shapes and
fragments, and irregular shapes. The groupings are as follows:

Artifact Analysis / 81
Group 1. Stemmed
Form 1. large with straight stems
Form 2. large with contracting stems
Form 3. large with expanding stems
Form 4. small with contracting stems
Form 5. small with expanding stems
Form 6. unclassifiable fragments of large stemmed bifaces
Form 7. unclassifiable fragments of small stemmed bifaces
Group 2. Unstemmed with straight bases
Form 1. complete triangular
Form 2. proximal fragments
Group 3. Unstemmed with concave bases
Form 1. complete triangular
Form 2. proximal fragments
Group 4. Unstemmed with convex to semicircular bases
Form 1. complete triangular
Form 2. steeply beveled blades
Form 3. oval to elliptical
Form 4. fragments with convex to semicircular ends
Group 5. Unstemmed leaf shaped
Group 6. Circular to subcircular
Group 7. Diamond shaped
Group 8. Bifaces with sharp slender projections
Group 9. Fragments with pointed ends
Group 10. Lateral and medial fragments
Group 11. Lanceolate shapes and fragments
Group 12. Irregular shapes
Group 5 was not used in this analysis because a clear division between this
group and Group 4 was not discernible. Given a larger sample, like that encountered in
the Choke Canyon studies, Group 5 may well be a viable classification. Also, no
specimens were placed in Group 4, Forms 2 or 3, which again is probably related to
collection strategy.
GROUP 1 (53 Specimens)
Stemmed projectile points in this group are either dart points, arrow points or
preforms. For this group, large is synonymous with dart point and small with arrow point.
Form 1 – 12 Specimens
This form includes large stemmed bifaces with stems that are roughly straight,
that is, with parallel edges. Three specimens can be placed within previously
established dart point typological groupings which include Andice (Fig. 11a). Bulverde
(Fig. 11b) and Pedernales-like (Fig. 11c). Pedernales dart points date to the Middle
Archaic (Suhm and Jelks 1962:235-238) and Bulverde points date to the Middle Archaic
in Central Texas (Prewitt 1981) or the Early Archaic in central, south and east Texas

Artifact Analysis / 83
(Turner and Hester 1985:73), depending on which chronology is used. The Early
Archaic scheme will be used in this analysis due to the South Texas location of the
project. Andice dart points are diagnostic of the early phase of the Early Archaic in
Central and south-central Texas (Prewitt 1983; Turner and Hester 1985:64).
The other nine dart points do not fall within established types (Fig. 11d). The
Pedernales-like specimen has a slightly concave base but otherwise is morphologically
the same as the prototype. The Andice specimen has been reworked to the point where
the massive barbs have been eliminated. Specimens in this form average 4.9 cm in
length, 2.6 cm in width, 0.8 cm in thickness, 1.6 cm in stem length, 1.6 cm in basal width
and 1.7 cm in neck width. All specimens are chert and all but one are fine-grained.
Form 2 – 7 Specimens
These dart points do not conform to previously established types although one
specimen (Fig. 11e) is similar to the Nolan type with steep, alternately beveled stem
edges. Unfortunately, this specimen has been broken and reworked to the point where
no definite designation can be made. Specimens in this form average 4.8 cm in length,
2.3 cm width, 0.8 cm thickness, 1.4 cm stem length, 1.2 cm basal width and 1.6 cm
neck width. Five specimens have some basal grinding evident, one of which is very
heavy. Six of these artifacts are chert and the other is a fine-grained petrified wood.
Form 3 – 19 Specimens
Twelve of these dart points fall within seven previously established types: Uvalde
(Fig. 11f,g); Morhiss (Fig. 11h); Frio (Fig. 11i,j); Ensor-like (Fig. 11k); Bell (Fig. 11l);
Gower (Fig. 11m) and Fairland (Fig. 11o,p). Bell (Sorrow et al. 1967:12-14), Gower
(Shafer 1963:57-81) and Uvalde (Suhm and Jelks 1962:255) dart points are diagnostic
of the Early Archaic in central and southwest Texas. Fairland (Suhm and Jelks
1962:191) dart points date to the Late Archaic in Central Texas. Morhiss dart points are
most common between central Texas and the Coastal Plain (Suhm and Jelks 1962:221)
and are diagnostic of the Middle to Late Archaic (Fox 1979:62). Frio points date to the
“Transitional Archaic” in south Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:100) and their
distribution is fairly wide, from central to southwest Texas. One specimen from
41MC345 (Lot 21) exhibits attributes of both Ensor and Frio points. Black and McGraw
(1985:105) give an excellent discussion of the problem with this loosely used diagnostic,
“Frensor”. This specimen has shallow side notches and a base broader than the
shoulders, similar to Ensor variants, but the base is generally concave with a slight
notch in the center, creating a recurved basal edge similar to Frio dart points. This
specimen appears to have more Ensor characteristics, so it will be typed as Ensor-like.
Ensor points also date to the “Transitional Archaic” in south Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:94). Seven of these projectile points are untypable but generally have distinctive
forms (Fig. 11n).
Specimens within this form average 4.6 cm length, 2.3 cm width, 0.7 cm
thickness, 1.3 cm stem length, 2.0 cm basal width, and 1.5 cm neck width. Eleven of

84 / San Miguel Prospect
these specimens exhibit light to moderate basal grinding. All artifacts are of chert except
one chalcedony dart point.
Form 4 – 3 Specimens
All three of these specimens are easily placed within the established Perdiz
arrow point type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:283) (Fig. 11r,s). Only one is complete enough
for a length measurement – 3.5 centimeters; this specimen is predominantly unifacially
chipped with bifacial workmanship evident only along the contracting base (Fig. 11s).
These specimens average 1.8 cm width, 0.3 cm thickness, 0.8 cm stem length, 0.25 cm
basal width and 0.7 cm neck width. All specimens are fine-grained chert.
Form 5 – 5 Specimens
Four of these specimens can be comfortably assigned to the Scallorn arrow point
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:285) (Fig. 11t-v). The other specimen appears to be a
Scallorn preform fragment. These artifacts average 3.7 cm length, 1.6 cm width, 0.4 cm
thickness, 0.65 cm stem length, 1.3 cm basal width, and 0.8 cm neck width. All
specimens are a fine-grained chert, except one of white translucent chalcedony.
Form 6 – 3 Specimens
These specimens are untypable thin stemmed biface fragments. One nearly
whole specimen is a crudely flaked, petrified wood stemmed biface. The unusual outline
of this specimen did not allow for comfortable placement into any of the other forms.
One specimen is a stemmed basal fragment in the peculiar shape of a diamond (Fig.
11q). Since these artifacts are fragmentary, no average length, basal width or stem
width was calculated. These specimens average 2.7 cm wide, 0.7 cm thick and 1.5 cm
in neck width. Two specimens are chert and the other is petrified wood.
Form 7 – 4 Specimens
Included in this form are arrow point fragments missing the proximal section
necessary for classification. As these specimens are fragmentary, no average length,
stem length or basal width was calculable. These artifacts average 1.7 cm in width, 0.4
cm thickness and 0.7 cm neck width. Two of the specimens are serrated along the
blade edges from the shoulders to the distal tips (Fig. 11w,x). The serrations are fairly
deep on the specimen from 41AT86. Three specimens are fine-grained chert while the
other is a fine-grained chalcedony.
GROUP 2 (45 Specimens)
Form 1 – 32 Specimens
Included in this form are specimens which fit into three previously established
projectile point types: Tortugas, Matamoros and “Early Triangular”. Two specimens can
be assigned to the Tortugas type (Fig. 12b,d), one to the Matamoros (Fig. 12e) and one
to Early Triangular (Fig. 12a). The Tortugas dart point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:249) has

Artifact Analysis / 85
alternately beveled blade edges and thinned base and may date from the Early to
Middle Archaic in south Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:152). The Matamoros type
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:215; Turner and Hester 1985:122) is commonly smaller than the
Tortugas, but both are triangular and have alternately beveled blade edges. The
Matamoros is thought to date to the Late Archaic in south Texas. The “Early Triangular”
variant (Hester 1971:79-80; Black and McGraw 1985:129-133; Turner and Hester
1985:89) is very similar to the Tortugas type but has, as a distinguishing attribute,
parallel oblique flaking along the blade edges. It appears to date to the Early Archaic in
south Texas. These three triangular forms may represent a continuum of change in
south Texas through the Archaic Period; although quite different technologies are
represented by the “Early Triangular” variant compared to the later forms.
At this point, it is warranted to point out that triangular, unstemmed thin bifaces
make up approximately two-thirds of the thin bifaces collected. The triangular
unstemmed forms present apparently became more abundant from the Middle Archaic
through the Late Archaic at Choke Canyon (Hall 1985). Thus, the large number of
triangular points found at the San Miguel project area are most likely expressions of
Middle and Late Archaic components. The more distinctive triangular forms (Tortugas,
Matamoros and Early Triangular) have been typed but the vast majority of these are
untypable due to a lack of morphological distinctiveness.
The specimens in this form are triangular in outline and have relatively straight
bases. Figure 12c is an example of the 28 untypable thin bifaces present within this
form. Some specimens are missing the distal tips, but at least three-quarters of the
artifacts are intact; Form 2 within this group includes proximal fragments that make up
less than three-quarters of the artifact. Most of the artifacts have been basally thinned
and 13 of these have one or more beveled blade edges. One specimen from 41MC356
has been basally ground. These artifacts average 5.0 cm length, 2.6 cm basal width, 2.6
cm maximum blade width and 0.08 cm thickness. Twenty-eight specimens are of chert,
three are of petrified wood and one, which appears to be an arrow point preform, is of
chalcedony.
Form 2 – 13 Specimens
This form is characterized by straight-based thin bifacial proximal fragments,
which compose less than three-quarters of the original artifact (Fig. 12f). This arbitrary
division is merely for descriptive purposes; some overlap exists between Forms 1 and 2
in this group because approximations had to be made about artifact lengths.
Accordingly, specimen length was not calculated. Specimens average 2.5 cm basal
width, 2.6 cm maximum width and 0.8 cm thickness. Eleven of these artifacts are of
chert while two are coarse grain quartzite.

Artifact Analysis / 87
GROUP 3 (8 Specimens)
Form 1 – 4 Specimens
Included in this form are triangular shapes which have slight to moderately
concave bases. One specimen from 41MC344 is steeply beveled along the left blade
edge; another from 41AT75 has one left blade edge beveled (Fig. 12g). The specimen
from 41MC359 has been basally ground and shows evidence of being reworked. These
specimens average 4.4 cm in length, 2.3 cm basal width, 2.4 cm maximum width and
0.8 cm thickness. All are made of fine-grain chert.
Form 2 – 4 Specimens
Form 2 includes proximal fragments of unstemmed thin bifaces with concave
bases. The specimen from 41MC102 is a basal fragment of a large, finely flaked biface
which may have been utilized as a knife (Fig. 12h). These specimens average 3.7 cm in
basal width, 3.7 cm in maximum width, and 0.9 cm in thickness. Only one length
measurement (6.2 cm) was approximated so no average length was calculable. All
specimens are of fine-grain chert.
GROUP 4 (31 Specimens)
Form 1 – 19 Specimens
This group includes unstemmed triangular shapes with convex to semicircular
bases. Form 1 projectile points conform to three established types: Abasolo, Catan and
Refugio. Four specimens (Fig. 12e-i) fit well into the Abasolo type (Suhm and Jelks
1962:165; Turner and Hester 1985:61), two others (Fig. 12o,p) can be placed into the
Refugio type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:241; Turner and Hester 1985:144) and one (Fig.
12n) is a Catan specimen (Suhm and Jelks 1962:175; Turner and Hester 1985:78).
These three types are very similar in outline, roughly triangular with rounded basal
corners. The Abasolo and Catan types are characterized by broad bases relative to the
artifact length. The Catan is uniformly smaller than the Abasolo. The Refugio is much
narrower and elongated and is thought to date to the Archaic Period (Turner and Hester
1985:144). Abasolo points are assumed to date to the Early or Middle Archaic (Turner
and Hester 1985:61) and Catan types are placed in the Late Archaic (ibid:78).
One Group 4 specimen appears to be an arrow point preform. These artifacts are
roughly complete, although distal tips are missing in a few instances. Nine of these
artifacts have at least one beveled blade edge. Twelve of these specimens were
untypable using current typologies (Fig. 12m). Specimens average 5.5 cm length, 2.3
cm basal width, 2.5 cm maximum width and 0.9 cm thickness. Sixteen specimens are
chert, primarily fine-grained, two are of a fine grain chalcedony and one is coarse grain
petrified wood.

88 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 4 – 12 Specimens
Included in this form are thin bifacial fragments with convex to semicircular ends
(Fig. 12r,s). All of the specimens appear to be basal fragments; the Choke Canyon
fragments within this form apparently included distal specimens also.
Some of the collected specimens are extremely thin, while one (from 41MC360,
lot 4) is as thick as any in the thin biface category. The blade edges on one face of the
latter are steeply beveled. Only one length was calculated (for 41MC360, lot 7; 3.8 cm)
for this form due to the fragmentary nature of the specimens. Average basal width is 2.3
cm, maximum blade width is 2.6 cm and average thickness is 0.7 cm. Eleven
specimens are made of fine-grain chert, one of coarse to medium grain chert.
GROUP 6 (3 Specimens)
These three thin bifaces are roughly circular in outline and plano-convex in cross
section. One specimen is notably thinner than the other two. One is an annealed chert
flake that has been bifacially flaked; one unifacially flaked edge has been shaped into a
concave scraper/spokeshave. The bit edge of this tool does not appear to have been
extensively utilized, although some wear is evident. Another specimen exhibits fine
retouch along its fairly steep blade edge (Fig. 13a). This specimen has been flaked
extensively on its ventral (flat, slightly concave) surface. This phenomenon may be the
result of resharpening the blade edge, or this hump-backed artifact may have served a
special function. Specimens average 4.7 cm length, 0.9 cm thickness and 3.9 cm
maximum width. Two are of fine-grain chert while the other is burned petrified
palmwood.
GROUP 7 (2 Specimens)
One of these thin bifacially chipped, diamond shaped artifacts falls within the
previously established Desmuke dart point type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:181; Turner and
Hester 1985:86). This specimen (Fig. 13b), made of fine-grained chert, has a slightly
twisted appearance due to beveling of the left blade edge on both faces. The other
specimen appears to be a dart point preform with crude left blade edge beveling on both
blade faces. This specimen is made of medium-grain (brittle) petrified wood. Average
length of the specimens is 4.5 cm, thickness is 0.9 cm and maximum width is 2.0 cm.
GROUP 8 (2 Specimens)
These two bifaces are both fragmentary but together they represent a complete
artifact, a drill or a perforator. One specimen, a proximal fragment with basal and medial
sections intact, is very exquisitely flaked (Fig. 13c). The base has ground edges and the
basal form is similar to that of Plainview points. The medial section appears to have
been flaked using the same techniques as were used on the base. It would appear from
first inspection of this tool that it had been reworked from a Plainview point. However,
after examining several identical tools in a local artifact collection and noting the
consistent overall workmanship on this tool type, it seems that this represents a definite
tool form. Also a portion of its medial section is slightly patinated. This specimen can be

tentatively assigned to the late Paleoindian/Early Archaic transition. The other specimen
is a distal fragment that is plano-convex in cross section with a raised central ridge on
one face, which gives the blade the appearance of being three-sided (Fig. 13d).
Average thickness for these two artifacts is 0.6 centimeters. Since both artifacts are
incomplete, other measurements are not relevant.
GROUP 9 (3 Specimens)
These are thin, bifacially flaked fragments with pointed ends. One specimen is
the distal portion of a thin biface which appears to have functioned as a knife (Fig. 13e).
It has heavy edge wear on both blade edges. The other two specimens are thicker and
appear to be unfinished tools broken during the manufacturing process. Specimens
average 3.0 cm in maximum width and 0.8 cm in thickness. One specimen is of coarsegrained quartzite, one of fine-grained chert and the third is a medium to fine-grained
chert.
GROUP 10 (2 Specimens)
These two thin bifacial fragments are too broken for inclusion in any of the other
groups. One is a medial fragment of a dart point (Fig. 13f) and the other is a patinated
lateral fragment of a thin biface. One is made of medium-grained chert, the other of finegrained chert. The two specimens average 1.7 cm in maximum width and 0.6 cm in
thickness.
GROUP 11 (2 Specimens)
This group includes two lanceolate point basal fragments; one (Fig. 13h) fits the
Golondrina type (Turner and Hester 1985:103-104) and the other (Fig. 13g) can be
assigned to the Angostura type. Both have concave bases and ground lateral basal
edges. The Golondrina specimen is plano-convex in cross-section, thus creating two
beveled edges on one face. The basal concavity and basal blade edges of the
Angostura specimen are ground. The two specimens average 2.2 cm in basal width, 2.8
cm in maximum width and 0.7 cm in thickness. The Golondrina is made of medium
grain chert, while the Angostura is fine-grain chert.
GROUP 12 (5 Specimens)
These bifacially flaked artifacts vary considerably in shape, thickness and
function. Two specimens are fairly thick and have the same general shape – that of a
convex end scraper. Both have plano-convex cross sections and have been broken.
One of these exhibits extensive use wear along the edges (Fig. 13i); the other has no
indication of use wear. One specimen in this group is a fairly thick biface broken during
manufacture and reworked in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage the tool. Another
specimen appears to have been used as a multifunctional tool (Fig. 13k). It is lunate in
shape and has one beveled edge, similar to the distally beveled tools. The opposite
edge appears to have functioned as a convex end scraper and both edges exhibit
heavy use wear. The last specimen is made of a coarse-grained quartzite and

Artifact Analysis / 91
functioned as a concave scraper or spokeshave (Fig. 13j). Five small spokeshave bits
are situated around the blade edges of this irregular artifact. Specimens in this group
average 4.4 cm in maximum width, and 1.7 cm in thickness. Except for the quartzite
artifact, all specimens are made of a fine- to medium-grained chert.
Distally Beveled Bifaces and Unifaces – 47 Specimens
This category includes chipped stone artifacts with beveled ends, artifacts
traditionally referred to as gouges (Ray 1941). Some studies (Hester et al. 1973;
Howard 1973) indicate they functioned as wood working tools. Specimens in this
category have been both bifacially and unifacially flaked and artifact thickness ranges
both above and below the arbitrary 1.3 cm standard used to differentiate thin from thick
bifaces. Thus, the morphology of the bit or working edge has been used for this tool
classification instead of the degree of facial chipping and thickness. Artifacts from the
project in this subclass have been referred to elsewhere as Clear Fork tools (Ray 1941),
Guadalupe tools (Campbell 1976; Black and McGraw 1985) and Nueces scrapers
(Hester, White and White 1969; Turner and Hester 1985).
Specimens vary considerably in outline from roughly triangular to subrectangular
with oval and elliptical shapes also present. Triangular forms are the most common in
the study area. Artifact cross sections include both biconvex and plano-convex, and the
beveled or bit edge may be convex, straight or concave. The specimens have been
divided into the groups below using outline, bit morphology and thickness as the primary
distinguishing attributes (Hall, Black and Graves 1982).
Group 1. Large triangular to subtriangular (Clear Fork gouge type 1, after Ray
1941)
Group 2. Large, elongate, rectangular to subrectangular (Clear Fork gouge type
3, after Ray 1941)
Form 1. long
Form 2. short
Group 3. Short, broad, triangular to subrectangular
Form 1. triangular, proximal end pointed
Form 2. triangular, proximal and rounded
Form 3. rectangular to subrectangular (Nueces scraper, after Hester,
White and White 1969)
Group 4. Small triangular to subtriangular
Group 5. Small, narrow distal fragments
Group 6. Long, narrow elliptical (Guadalupe tools, after Campbell 1976; Black
and McGraw 1985)
Group 7. Various forms with broad, rounded, low-angle bevels
Form 1. elongate, elliptical to subrectangular
Form 2. short, broad, subrectangular to oval
Form 3. subtriangular
Form 4. distal fragments
Group 8. Miscellaneous forms
Form 1. triangular to subtriangular with steep bevels

92 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 2. steeply beveled sides
Form 3. offset bevels
Form 4. broad, flat, triangular
Form 5. odd shapes
Form 6. short, thick, triangular, crudely flaked – possible preform
Group 9. Distal fragments
As a result of collection strategy, several of these groups and some forms within them
are not represented in the artifact sample. No Group 2 or 5 artifacts were recovered;
similarly, no Group 7, Forms 1, 2 or 4 and no Group 8, Form 2 were collected. One
additional form was added to Group 8 (Form 6) in order to separate two very similar
artifacts from the other forms. This thick form may represent a preform for this tool type.
Length measurements on these artifacts are all taken perpendicular to the beveled bit
edge while width measurements are parallel to the bit edge.
GROUP 1 (2 Specimens)
These two specimens are roughly triangular in outline with the broad end serving
as the beveled bit end. Both specimens have biconvex lateral cross sections, have been
bifacially chipped and have a central ridge running the length of the face opposite the
bit. One specimen has a straight, slightly offset bit edge while the other specimen (Fig.
14a) has a fairly straight bit edge with a slight central concavity. Both artifacts are
slightly cusped at the corners where the bit and lateral edges meet. Average specimen
length is 5.2 cm, maximum width is 3.4 cm and thickness is 1.5 cm. Bevel angles are 67
degrees on one specimen and 74 degrees on the other. Both are made of fine-grained
chert.
GROUP 3 (21 Specimens)
This group has been divided into three forms, all of which include artifacts that
are generally short and broad. Forms 1 and 2 include triangular specimens that are very
similar to Group 1 artifacts, the primary difference being that Group 3 specimens are
much shorter. These Group 3 triangular specimens have been separated into two forms
based on proximal end morphology. The third form contains artifacts that are
rectangular to subrectangular in outline and have been referred to as Nueces scrapers
(Hester, White and White 1969). Of the 21 specimens in this group, 14 have been
bifacially chipped. Unifacial specimens are plano-convex in lateral cross section while
bifacial specimens have biconvex cross sections. The beveled bit edges are generally
straight; although a few specimens have concave bit edges. The bit angle varies
considerably within this group.

94 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 1 – 7 Specimens
This form includes short, broad triangular distally beveled specimens with pointed
proximal ends. Two of the seven specimens have a pronounced cusp at the intersection
of the bit and lateral edges, similar to Group 1 specimens; both have deeply “scooped
out” concave bit edges (Fig. 14b). One of these artifacts is the only unifacial specimen
within this form. The remaining specimens in this form have relatively straight bit edges
(Fig. 14c). Two artifacts have had their proximal ends broken off; thus, their inclusion in
this form was based on their overall morphological appearance. These specimens
average 4.3 cm in length, 3.9 cm width and 1.5 cm thickness. The bit angle varies from
60 to 80 degrees. All specimens are of a fine to medium grain chert.
Form 2 – 5 Specimens
These specimens are subtriangular in outline with rounded proximal ends. Two
specimens have slightly concave bit edges (Fig. 14e), two have slightly convex bit
edges (Fig. 14d) and the fifth has a steep, straight offset bit edge. One specimen, with a
slightly concave bit edge, may have been utilized as a spokeshave. Specimens average
3.5 cm in length, 4.3 cm in width and 1.3 cm in thickness. Bit edge angle varies
considerably from 58 to 84 degrees. All specimens are made of fine to medium grain
chert.
Form 3 – 9 Specimens
These specimens are all rectangular to subrectangular in outline with straight bit
edges (Fig. 14f,g). All complete specimens are wider than they are long. Only one
specimen has been unifacially chipped. One has a spokeshave bit that has been
fashioned along one lateral edge. One, which appears to be a preform, has no evident
use wear and only a slight beveled bit edge has been set up. Three specimens have
broken proximal ends and two have definite cusps at the distal corners. Specimens
average 3.6 cm in length, 4.6 cm in width and 0.9 cm in thickness. Bit edge angles vary
from 53 to 77 degrees. All artifacts are made of fine to medium grain chert.
GROUP 4 (4 Specimens)
This group includes specimens that are triangular to subtriangular in outline.
They differ from Group 1 in that they are smaller, have straight to convex bit edges, are
thinner and have been finely flaked. The longest Group 4 specimen in this collection is
about the same length as the Group 1 specimens, however, bit morphology and
thickness were used as primary determinants for group placement in this case. All
specimens have straight to slightly convex bit edges. One has two bits on the distal
(wide) end (Fig. 14h). Both bits are straight but are at different angles. The two bits
meet near the center of the distal end, forming a small rounded projection. The proximal
end of this specimen has been broken off; the other specimens are complete. All have
been bifacially worked, but two of the artifacts are plano-convex in lateral cross section.
These two are morphologically similar, appearing to be “hump backed”. Both of these
artifacts were recovered from 41MC344 (Fig. 14i). The specimens average 5.2 cm in

Artifact Analysis / 95
length, 3.6 cm in width and 1.0 cm in thickness. The artifact with the two bits has bit
angles of 54 degrees and 74 degrees. The other three specimens have bit angles of 45,
59 and 65 degrees. Three specimens are of fine-grain chert, the other is of opalized
wood.
GROUP 6 (1 Specimen)
This fine-grain chert specimen (Fig. 14m) is the longest and thickest of all the
distally beveled tools recovered. It is as long, but not as narrow, as the Choke Canyon
specimen for this group. The distal end is as wide as any other area on the artifact,
giving it a triangular shape instead of the elliptical shape characteristic of this group.
The other morphological attributes of this group are evident on the specimen. Bifacial
workmanship, a thick plano-convex cross section and positioning of the beveled bit on
the relatively flat face allow placement of this specimen in this group. The bit has been
fashioned from a single oblique flake facet. The specimen is 10.1 cm long, 5.3 cm wide
and 2.7 cm thick with a bit angle of 42 degrees. This type of gouge has been referred to
as a Guadalupe adze (Campbell 1976). Guadalupe tool (Black and McGraw 1985) or
Guadalupe biface (Turner and Hester 1985), and may well represent a tool type
completely different from the normal gouge or distally beveled tool.
GROUP 7 (2 Specimens)
In the Choke Canyon specimens, this group shows considerable variation in
outline, but only two artifacts were found in the San Miguel Project area which fit into the
group (Fig. 14j). Both are subtriangular in outline, thus fitting into Form 3. These
specimens are very similar in shape and bevel morphology. The bit edge is markedly
convex and is characterized by low angle bevel. Both specimens retain cortex on the
dorsal face. All of the Choke Canyon specimens in this group were bifacially chipped;
however, one of the San Miguel specimens is unifacially chipped.
Form 3 – 2 Specimens
This form is very similar in outline to Group 1 except for the bit morphology.
These two specimens average 6.7 cm in length, 4.6 cm in width and 1.7 cm in
thickness. The beveled bit angle of each is 58 and 52 degrees respectively. Both are
made of coarse-grained chert.
GROUP 8 (15 Specimens)
This group contains six miscellaneous forms which cannot be comfortably placed
into any of the other groups. The distal bevel is their only common trait. Form 6 was
added for the purposes of this study.

96 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 1 – 2 Specimens
These two are roughly triangular in outline and are unifacially worked (Fig. 14k).
Both are plano-convex in lateral cross section and have fairly steep beveled bits, 67 and
69 degrees, respectively. Average length of the specimens is 5.6 cm, width is 3.5 cm
and thickness is 1.6 cm. Both artifacts are fashioned from fine- to medium-grained
chert.
Form 3 – 3 Specimens
These specimens are roughly subrectangular in outline and have bevels offset to
the left (Fig. 14l,n). All three have unifacially worked bit edges, although two have flakes
removed from the ventral surface. All are plano-convex in cross section, and two retain
cortex on the dorsal face. These specimens average 6.8 cm in length, 3.9 cm in width
and 1.8 cm in thickness. All three have steep bevel angles; 70, 75 and 80 degrees. One
specimen appears to have been burned, all are made of fine-grain chert.
Form 4 – 2 Specimens
This form is characterized by a triangular outline with a very wide bit (Fig. 14o).
These two specimens are relatively flat, plano-convex, and have fairly low angle bits.
Both have been unifacially chipped. One retains cortex on the dorsal face. Bevel edges
are relatively straight to slightly convex. The specimens average 5.3 cm in length, 4.3
cm in width and 1.5 cm in thickness and have bevel angles 44 and 64 degrees
respectively. Both specimens are made of a fine-grain chert.
Form 5 – 6 Specimens
These six specimens are eccentric or oddly shaped. Only one specimen is planoconvex in cross section; it has been unifacially worked and has the form of a
“strangulated” uniface (Weir 1976), being T-shaped with the bit angle on the broad end
(Fig. 15a). One specimen appears to have been fashioned from a broken thick biface
with the bit located along the fracture. Two specimens have the bit on the ventral face
as the Group 6 specimen does, but the outline and workmanship are crude, and both
retain cortex on the face opposite the bevel. One specimen retains cortex on its dorsal
face. Another has what appears to be a reworked offset bit (Fig. 15b). Five of the six
specimens have been bifacially worked, but two have only unifacial work along the bit
edge. These specimens average 5.2 cm in length, 3.6 cm in width and 1.6 cm in
thickness. Bit angles range from 56 to 82 degrees and all specimens are made from
coarse to fine-grain cherts.
Form 6 – 2 Specimens
This form was added to Group 8 to distinguish this artifact type, which may
represent a preform stage (Fig. 15c). Both specimens, from 41MC102, are roughly
triangular in shape, fairly thick for their short length, and have been crudely flaked. One
specimen has no use wear, while the other has a very slightly dulled bit edge. These

98 / San Miguel Prospect
specimens have slightly convex bit edges, have been bifacially chipped, and are
biconvex in cross section. The specimens average 5.5 cm in length, 3.9 cm in width and
1.9 cm in thickness. One specimen is made of fine-grained chert, the other of mediumgrained chert. If these specimens do represent preforms, because of their short lengths,
they may have eventually been intended to be Group 3, Form 1 artifacts.
GROUP 9 (2 Specimens)
These distal fragments retain too little of the proximal end for placement in any of
the previously described groups. Both have been bifacially worked, are biconvex in
cross section and have roughly straight bit edges (Fig. 15d). The specimens average
4.1 cm in width and 1.4 cm in thickness, and are of medium- to fine-grained chert.
Unifaces – 40 Specimens
A uniface is a tool that has been manufactured on a flake or flake fragment. The
dorsal surface of the flake is chipped and the ventral surface is left untouched. Unifaces
and trimmed flakes are similar, but trimmed flakes retain the original flake shape or
outline while unifaces do not. It is apparent that distally beveled unifaces would satisfy
the definition for unifaces, but the distinctive form of that artifact type is enough to group
it with the bifacial distally beveled tools. Some of the artifacts exhibit some degree of
flaking on the ventral surface. Some of this flaking is located along the utilized edge
while the rest is unrelated to this edge. Essentially, all of these artifacts are still
unifaces; the ventral flaking can be related to platform preparation in most cases. These
artifacts are believed to have functioned as scrapers, gouges, gravers and
spokeshaves. Six descriptive groups have been set up for these artifacts, based
primarily on shape (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:349).
Group 1. Large elliptical
Group 2. Subcircular to oval
Group 3. Triangular to subtriangular
Form 1. thick
Form 2. thin
Group 4. Truncated of fragmentary with rounded ends
Group 5. Irregular shapes
Group 6. Fragments with pointed ends
Group 3 has been subdivided into thick and thin forms. No Group 6 artifacts were
collected from the project area. Specimen lengths are measured on the long axis and
widths on the short axis.
GROUP 1 (14 Specimens)
These four chert specimens are roughly elliptical in outline and plano-convex in
cross section (Fig. 13l). All retain patches of cortex on the convex face. Two specimens
are similar, with steep rounded utilized edges. The specimens average 7.5 cm in length,
4.9 cm in width and 2.7 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary on each artifact with the
maximum range of 64 to 82 degrees; the minimum range from 51 to 67 degrees.

Artifact Analysis / 99
GROUP 2 (6 Specimens)
These chert specimens are all subcircular to oval and plano-convex in cross
section (Fig. 13m). One specimen is comparable in size and weight to Group 1 artifacts,
however it is subcircular in outline. The same specimen is similar to the two Group 1
specimens with steep rounded utilized edges. This artifact, and one from Group 1, have
been utilized along a ventrally scooped out convex edge. One specimen has a small
spokeshave worked along one edge. All specimens retain patches of the cobble cortex.
The specimens average 5.8 cm in length, 5.3 cm in width and 2.3 in thickness. The
maximum edge angle range is from 65 to 81 degrees, the minimum range is from 40 to
80 degrees.
GROUP 3 (10 Specimens)
These specimens are triangular to subtriangular in outline and have planoconvex cross sections. This group is divided into thin and thick forms based on an
arbitrary thickness of 1.8 centimeters.
Form 1 – 5 Specimens
These five chert specimens vary in size and form, but are all fairly thick. Two
exhibit heavy use wear (Fig. 13n) while one has no discernible wear patterns. Four
retain some cortex on the dorsal face. Specimens average 6.8 cm in length, 4.6 cm in
width and 2.0 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary from a maximum of 73 to 83 degrees,
to a minimum of 56 to 70 degrees.
Form 2 – 5 Specimens
These five specimens are roughly triangular in shape and are fairly thin,
compared to Form 1 (Fig. 13o). All are plano-convex in cross section and are uniformly
smaller than the Form 1 specimens. Heavy use wear is evident on three specimens, the
other two have light to moderate use wear. Four retain patches of cobble cortex on the
dorsal surface. Specimens average 5.3 cm in length, 3.6 cm in width, and 1.4 cm in
thickness. Edge angles vary from a maximum of 65 to 80 degrees and a minimum of 36
to 64 degrees. All specimens are made of a fine to medium grain chert.
GROUP 4 (5 Specimens)
These chert specimens vary from subcircular to subrectangular in outline. One is
a unifacial bit edge which has been removed from the remainder of the tool, appearing
to be the result of rejuvenation of the working edge (Fig. 10k). One specimen is
biconvex due to its peculiar shape; the other specimens are plano-convex, as expected
in this artifact class. All specimens have convex or rounded bit edges. Three retain
patches of cortex on the dorsal face. One specimen exhibits heavy use wear along the
bit edge (Fig. 10j). Light to moderate use wear is evident on the other four. Specimens
average 6.1 cm in length, 4.6 cm in width and 1.9 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary
from a maximum of 68 to 80 degrees to a minimum of 59 to 70 degrees.

100 / San Miguel Prospect
GROUP 5 (15 Specimens)
This group varies considerably in outline, size and thickness. All specimens are
plano-convex in cross section. The group displays the widest variety in tool forms of any
of the uniface groups, which include gravers, spokeshaves and scrapers. Four
specimens can be labeled multipurpose tools. Two of these, which are similar in shape,
have a graver, spokeshave (concave scraper) and convex scraper (Fig. 10n). Two other
specimens have similar shapes with multiple gravers and spokeshaves interspersed
around the edge. Six artifacts have spokeshave bits. One of these is too large to have
functioned like the others (for shaving atlatls, dartshafts, arrowshafts, etc.), thus may
have been used to scrape bark off a small tree or sapling (maybe for dwelling supports).
Another of these specimens is a strangulated uniface (Weir 1976) with a spokeshave
along one edge of the neck. The other artifacts in this group can be referred to as side
and end scrapers. Three side scrapers, one end scraper and an unusual uniface
complete the specimen inventory for this group. Specimens average 5.5 cm in length,
3.9 cm in width and 1.5 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary from a maximum of 69 to 90
degrees to a minimum of 58 to 66 degrees. Three specimens are of medium- to finegrained petrified wood. The other twelve are made of fine- to medium-grained chert.
One waxy gray specimen (Fig. 10m) is a side scraper that has been annealed.
Trimmed Flakes – 29 Specimens
Trimmed flakes are flakes which have been chipped to form a working edge.
These flakes are not altered appreciably, unlike unifaces. Trimmed flakes are thought to
have served as spokeshaves, end scrapers, side scrapers and knives. Hall (Hall, Black
and Graves 1982) divided the trimmed flakes into four groups: Group 3 being
subdivided into five forms and Group 4 into six forms. Shape or outline were the criteria
variables in this typology.
Group 1. Circular to subcircular
Group 2. Large, oval to elliptical
Group 3. Thin blade flakes and fragments
Form 1. rectangular
Form 2. triangular
Form 3. convergent
Form 4. divergent
Form 5. distal fragments
Group 4. Miscellaneous thick flakes and fragments
Form 1. divergent
Form 2. rectangular
Form 3. offset
Form 4. split cobble
Form 5. fragments with rounded ends
Form 6. unclassified fragments
Once again, due to collection methodology and limited (surface) artifact sample, Forms
1 and 2 of Group 3, and Forms 2, 3 and 5 of Group 4 are not found in the San Miguel
collection. As with unifaces, artifact lengths are the long axis and widths the short axis.

Artifact Analysis / 101
GROUP 1 (4 Specimens)
These specimens are circular to subcircular in shape and plano-convex in cross
section. The convex face of each retains 50 to 95 percent of the cobble cortex. Three
specimens have been flaked on the convex face only. Of these, one specimen has been
fashioned from a split cobble but the sheared cone has been removed through flake
removal on the cortex face. The other two are a primary flake and a secondary flake;
the secondary flake has had a spokeshave bit fashioned along one edge (Fig. 15e). The
other specimen is a heavily weathered, bifacially worked primary flake. The bifacially
chipped areas are less weathered than the rest of this artifact. Specimens average 6.1
cm in length, 6.0 cm in width and 2.1 cm in thickness. Edge angles range from a
maximum of 76 to 86 degrees to a minimum of 53 degrees. One specimen is made of
medium-grained chert, the other three are fine-grained chert.
GROUP 2 (2 Specimens)
These two chert specimens are fairly large; one is oval and the other is elliptical.
Both are plano-convex in cross section. The oval specimen is a primary flake that has
been extensively chipped on the dorsal surface (Fig. 15f). Several flakes have also
been removed from the ventral surface along an unused edge. This specimen exhibits
heavy use wear along the fairly long finished edge and retains approximately 30 percent
of the cortex on the dorsal face. The edge angle is 61 to 81 degrees. The elliptical
specimen is a flat cobble fragment that has been trimmed on one face. This specimen
has been included with trimmed flakes for lack of a more appropriate category. Use
wear is evident along the worked edge, the edge angle range is 57 to 67 degrees.
These specimens average 7.5 cm in length, 4.8 cm in width and 1.7 cm in thickness.
GROUP 3 (12 Specimens)
This group has been subdivided into five forms based on flake outline. Forms 1
and 2 were not represented in the artifact collection.
Form 3 – 1 Specimen
This secondary convergent flake (Fig. 15g) has been trimmed along one edge.
Convergent flakes are widest at the platform end and taper to a narrower end opposite
the platform. The dorsal surface of this fine-grain chert specimen is approximately 70
percent cortex. It is 5.0 cm long, 3.6 cm wide and 0.7 cm thick. The edge angle is 62
degrees.

102 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 4 – 10 Specimens
Divergent flakes are widest at the end opposite the platform. Five unifacially
chipped specimens exhibit both lateral and end trimming. One of these artifacts (Fig.
15h) has been finely flaked, having both a low angle convex edge and a steep concave
edge. Two specimens have spokeshave bits (Fig. 15j); one has three spokeshave bits
interspersed with two broken graver bits (Fig. 15i). Two of these divergent forms have
been bifacially chipped. The other three have been unilaterally trimmed with one
displaying a spokeshave bit. The specimens average 4.8 cm in length, 3.4 cm in width,
and 0.9 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary from a maximum of 41 to 78 degrees to a
minimum of 33 to 56 degrees. One specimen is made of medium-grained petrified
wood, the others are fine- to medium-grained chert.
Form 5 – 1 Specimen
This fine-grained chert flake fragment (Fig. 15k) has a finely trimmed edge and is
plano-convex in cross section. A break perpendicular to the trimmed edge has removed
a portion of this edge. Approximately 70 percent of the cortex is retained on the dorsal
face. Some ventral face chipping has slightly altered the outline of this fragment. The
artifact is 3.7 cm long, 3.0 cm wide and 1.4 cm thick. Edge angle varies from 61 to 66
degrees on this artifact.
GROUP 4 (11 Specimens)
This group has been subdivided into six forms, but Forms 2, 3 and 5 were not
found in the San Miguel collection.
Form 1 – 5 Specimens
These specimens are subrectangular to oval and are thickly plano-convex in
cross section. Cortex covers 30 to 90 percent of the dorsal face on three specimens.
Four specimens are on primary flakes, the other is on a secondary flake. Two
specimens exhibit both unilateral and end trimming (Fig. 15m). Two are unilaterally
trimmed and the other has a spokeshave bit positioned where the platform once was.
One also has a spokeshave bit along one edge. These specimens average 5.9 cm in
length, 4.5 cm in width and 1.8 cm in thickness. Edge angle varies from a maximum of
87 degrees to a minimum range of 61 to 65 degrees. All specimens are fine- to mediumgrained chert.
Form 4 – 1 Specimen
This fine-grain chert, split cobble fragment (Fig. 15n) has another split cobble
flake scar on the dorsal face. It has been unilaterally trimmed and retains approximately
20 percent of the cobble cortex on the dorsal face. This specimen is 11.2 cm long, 7.1
cm wide and 2.8 cm thick with an edge angle range of 71 to 76 degrees.

Artifact Analysis / 103
Form 6 – 5 Specimens
These miscellaneous specimens vary in outline. Peculiarities have rendered
them unclassifiable. Two specimens are actually chert pebbles with polished, weathered
surfaces. Both of these specimens have been trimmed along the edges; one was
fashioned into a spokeshave (Fig. 15l). Another specimen, a tertiary flake, has a small
spokeshave bit. One specimen is an odd shaped primary flake and one is a fairly thick
secondary flake. These specimens average 4.8 cm in length, 8.2 cm in width and 1.6
cm in thickness. Edge angles vary from a maximum of 83 degrees to a minimum of 63
to 70 degrees. Two of the specimens are of fine-grained petrified wood, the remainder
are fine- to medium-grain chert.
Utilized Debitage – 18 Specimens
This category was added to Hall’s Choke Canyon typology to accommodate 17
utilized flakes and 1 utilized chunk. Utilized flakes are differentiated from trimmed flakes
by the absence of chipping; they exhibit use wear but were apparently used unaltered
initially. In the Choke Canyon typology, these artifacts were included in the debitage
category. Utilized debitage is subdivided into five groups, based on type. No utilized
primary flakes were collected, but this group was established so that future testing data
can be easily incorporated into this scheme.
Group 1.
Group 2.
Group 3.
Group 4.

Primary flakes
Secondary flakes
Tertiary flakes
Chips
Form 1. cortex
Form 2. no cortex
Group 5. Chunks
Form 1. cortex
Form 2. no cortex
GROUP 2 (9 Specimens)
These specimens vary considerably in size and outline but all retain striking
platforms, patches of cortex and were produced using a hard hammer technique (Fig.
16a, b). All but two also retain the bulb of percussion. One specimen has two utilized
edges; all others have only one. The platform of one specimen exhibits several incipient
cones from unsuccessful hard hammer blows. One of these blows apparently destroyed
part of the platform. These specimens vary in degree of use and average 5.2 cm in
length, 4.0 cm in width and 1.3 cm in thickness. Edge angles range from a maximum of
64 degrees to a minimum of 45 degrees. A variety of materials were used in the
manufacture of these specimens. One is of burned, medium-grained palmwood, one is
a medium-grained quartzite, one is coarse-grained chert and the rest are fine-grained
chert.

Artifact Analysis / 105
GROUP 3 (2 Specimens)
These two specimens are tertiary flakes, one produced by hard hammer
techniques, the other using a soft hammer technique. The hard hammer flake retains its
bulb of percussion (Fig. 16c). This specimen is 4.0 cm long, 3.4 cm wide and 1.0 cm
thick with a utilized edge angle of 70 degrees. It has been fashioned from a beautiful,
fine-grain, banded chert. The soft hammer flake is a proximal fragment which retains the
lip and diffuse bulb of force. This fine-grain chert specimen is 3.3 cm long, 2.3 cm wide
and 0.5 cm thick and has a utilized edge angle of 39 degrees.
GROUP 4 (6 Specimens)
Form 1 – 2 Specimens
Both of these two distal flake fragments retain some cortex on the dorsal face.
The specimens differ primarily in thickness, one is 0.7 cm thick and the other is 1.2 cm
thick (Fig. 16d). They are both 3.5 cm in length and average 2.6 cm in width. Both are
fine-grain chert.
Form 2 – 4 Specimens
These chips are fairly similar in outline and size but reflect varying degrees of
utilization. One specimen has a distal hinged edge and one has a distal feathered edge.
The other two are chips with no distinctive morphological characteristics. One of these
two has been trimmed, to form a spokeshave bit. This bit is slightly nibbled but lacks
edge wear. The heavy use wear on the utilized edge of this specimen places it in the
utilized debitage category rather than with trimmed flakes. The specimens average 3.9
cm in length, 2.6 cm in width and 0.6 cm in thickness. Edge angles vary from a
maximum of 74 degrees to a minimum of 37 degrees. All are fine-grain chert.
GROUP 5 (1 Specimen)
This chunk of tabular petrified wood (Fig. 16i) has step fractures. Three edges
exhibit varying degrees of utilization. One of these edges may have been slightly
trimmed but the other two show only use; thus, this chunk was placed in the utilized
debitage category. The specimen is 6.1 cm long, 3.9 cm wide and 1.0 cm thick with
utilized edge angles of 47, 66 and 90 degrees.
Debitage – 49 Specimens
This category differs slightly from Hall’s (Hall, Black and Graves 1982) Choke
Canyon debitage category. Since the San Miguel sites were selectively collected, the
sample size is small. Much of this debitage was collected for material identification and
thus does not represent a meaningful sample. It was put into the existing Choke Canyon
framework for future reference. The utilized or modified flakes were placed into the
newly created category of Utilized Debitage. Soft hammer flakes are differentiated in the
secondary and tertiary flake groups. One category was added to accommodate a

106 / San Miguel Prospect
chalcedony chipping station recorded at 41MC108. Thirty-five flakes, chips and shatter
of chalcedony were collected from this approximately 1 meter square area.

Hammerstones – 1 Specimen
Only one hammerstone (Fig. 16h) was collected, although a few more were
observed in the field. Hall’s (Hall, Black and Graves 1982) Choke Canyon
hammerstones were divided into probable and possible hammerstones. This small,
black quartzite gravel with small white inclusions has been put into the possible
hammerstone group because of its size (3.8 cm x 3.4 cm x 2.9 cm) and the rather
random pecking on its surface.
Ground Stone – 8 Specimens
These specimens vary in size and shape. All but one are modified sandstone that
probably is locally derived from the only exposed geologic formation in the project area,
the Jackson Group. These sandstone artifacts are divided as follows:
Group 1. Smoothed slabs and fragments with flat and/or concave faces
Form 1. large
Form 2. medium
Form 3. small
Group 2. Subcircular to angular pieces with flat and/or convex faces
Form 1. wedge-shaped cross section
Form 2. lenticular cross section
Group 3. Grooved pieces

Artifact Analysis / 107
Lengths and widths are measured along the long and short axes, respectively.
These artifacts are interpreted as vegetal food processing implements.
GROUP 1 (5 Specimens)
The specimens in this group have been subdivided into three forms dependent
on the maximum length of the artifact. The utilized faces of all artifacts in this group are
flat to concave, suggesting use as metates, or grinding slabs.
Form 1 – 2 Specimens
These specimens are greater than 15 cm in length and represent two different
activities. One specimen is complete (16.7 x 14.9 x 5.4 cm) and has a concave
depression 8.5 cm in diameter on one face. The concave depression on this fairly hard,
coarse-grained sandstone specimen is rough and unevenly smoothed and appears to
have been pecked; thus, this artifact would seem to have been used as an anvil. The
other specimen is a fragment (26.6 x 13.3 x 6.1 cm) of a grinding slab. This fine- to
medium-grained specimen has portions of three smoothed surfaces on it, with two on
one side and one on the other. From the wear pattern on these surfaces, it is evident
that this specimen was used differently than the other specimen within this form.
Form 2 – 1 Specimen
This specimen (13.8 x 10.2 x 4.2 cm) has a length that falls within the 9 to 14
centimeter range that has been set up for this form. This complete specimen is
rectangular in outline with a smooth central depression on one face that measures
approximately 10 by 5 centimeters and is fairly shallow, ca. one centimeter deep. This
ground stone could and probably was carried from place to place because of its small
size. It has been fashioned from fine- to medium-grained sandstone.
Form 3 – 2 Specimens
These two small fine- to medium-grained ground stone fragments both have flat,
extremely smooth surfaces on one face. The specimens average 4.6 cm in length, 3.3
cm in width and 2.3 cm in thickness.
GROUP 2 (1 Specimen)
This group is for subcircular to angular ground stone pieces that have flat to
convex faces. This specimen, because of this size (8.3 x 5.2 x 3.1 cm) and the convex
shape of the smoothed face, is suggested to have functioned as a mano; that is, the
piece held in the hand when grinding material on a slab.

108 / San Miguel Prospect
Form 2 – 1 Specimen
The previously described artifact has been fashioned from medium grain
sandstone. It has a lenticular cross section.
GROUP 3 (1 Specimen)
This specimen is angular in outline and has six distinct shallow grooves on one
face. It is darkly weathered on all edges but may be a fragment of a larger piece. It is
5.0 cm long, 3.9 cm wide and 1.0 cm thick and is fine-grained sandstone.
MODIFIED QUARTZITE AND IGNEOUS ROCK (1 Specimen)
This specimen is a black pebble that appears to have been smoothed
intentionally on one flat surface. It measures 2.7 cm in length, 2.4 cm in width and 1.8
cm in thickness.
Miscellaneous Lithic Artifacts and Material
Other lithic samples collected on this survey include miscellaneous burned rock
and unmodified lithic samples (Table 2), collected to complete the lithic sample from the
area. Burned rocks collected include petrified wood (primarily palmwood), chert and
hematite. The presence of burned palmwood and chert at a number of the sites may
indicate some heat treating (annealing) of this material occurred. Unmodified lithic
samples collected include petrified wood, chert and caliche.
SHELL ARTIFACTS
Only one marine shell artifact and one mussel shell artifact were gathered from
prehistoric contexts. Additionally, several modern mussel shell bivalves were collected
from La Jarita Creek for present-day fauna identification.
Marine Shell
CONCH COLUMELLA (1 Specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 16e) was surface collected from 41MC103 and measures
9.7 cm in length and 2.0 cm in diameter; the deep spiral is right-handed. This columella
is that of a Florida horse conch, Pleurophloca gigantea (Andrews 1971), an inhabitant of
the Gulf Coast. The larger end has been cut and beveled at a 62 degree angle, and is
greatly smoothed, possibly through the processing of hides. An unusual groove,
approximately 1 millimeter wide, near the smallest end, cuts through several whorls,
perpendicular to the long axis of the artifact. This groove and the smoothing of rough
edges suggest the specimen was worn as a pendant.

Artifact Analysis / 109
Mussel Shell – 1 Specimen
This mussel shell fragment was surface collected from 41MC363, a valley/upland
margin site near the confluence of La Jarita and Hog creeks. The shell fragment,
identified as Cyrtonaias tampicoensis (Neck 1985), was collected from the upland
margin area, approximately 300 meters upslope from the confluence. This species only
lives in permanent water. Unless this specimen was brought to the site from one of the
nearby permanent water courses, the present intermittent nature of La Jarita Creek has
been greatly altered since prehistoric times.
CERAMIC ARTIFACT
One plain body sherd (Fig. 16g) was surface collected from 41MC102 near La
Jarita Creek. It is 3.1 cm in length and 0.7 cm in thickness and has a sandy paste with
bone temper. The sand, seemingly a natural inclusion, may indicate an alluvial clay
source. Bone-tempered plain wear is the predominant prehistoric type found in South
Texas (Hester and Hill 1971) and this sherd fits well into this tradition. One large
inclusion, cemented fine sand grains, may be crushed rock temper or a fortuitous
inclusion in the paste. The core or carbon streak is visible over approximately 80
percent of the cross section.
CONCLUSION
Several observations can be made concerning the wide range of prehistoric
artifacts collected and observed in the San Miguel Lignite project area. Chronologically,
this sample represents material from the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric
periods. Lithic raw materials include chert, chalcedony, quartzite, sandstone, rhyolite,
petrified wood and opalized wood. Thick bifaces appear to occur in greater numbers in
valley or creekside sites.
Lithic technologies represented by the sample include a cobble industry for
bifacial reduction, a flake industry using a split cobble technique and a core – blade
industry involving blade detachment (Hester 1975). In this conclusion, a functional
interpretation of the various artifacts is attempted, and an observation about the flow of
La Jarita Creek is made, using mussel shell fragments from present and prehistoric
contexts.
The proximal end of a Folsom type projectile point was collected by the
landowner at 41MC364, an upland margin site. The only artifacts found on the survey
that may be of equal age are a Plainview-like base that had been worked into a drill or
perforator, and a Golondrina base. The Plainview-like base was collected from
41MC349, a valley-upland margin site adjacent to Salt Branch while the Golondrina
base was found on an upland divide (Isolated Find 1). Late Paleoindian manifestations
observed in the project area were represented by the Angostura projectile point from the
valley site 41MC103 and several projectile points (Scottsbluff, Angostura types)
collected by one of the landowners (Hester 1980). It can be postulated that Paleoindian
settlement was oriented toward the valley/upland margin areas, but due to the limited

110 / San Miguel Prospect
artifact sample this hypothesis remains tentative. Usrey’s (1980) most significant
Paleoindian component was found at a Prospect valley site, 41AT54. Paleoindian
period artifacts at Choke Canyon were observed at only 12 prehistoric sites, which were
located primarily along ancient floodplain terrace remnants, with upland valley margins
also represented (Hall 1985). The differences in sampling universe for the Choke
Canyon and San Miguel projects accounts for different Paleoindian settlement
preferences observed between these areas.
The Early Archaic Period in the project area is fairly well represented. The Gower
points from 41MC348 (valley) and 41MC104 (valley); the reworked Andice projectile
point from 41MC366 (valley), the Bulverde and broken Bell form 41MC360 (upland
divide), the Uvalde points from 41MC360, 41MC107 (upland margins), and 41AT86
(upland divide) and the Early Triangular from 41AT86 represent the Early Archaic
projectile points collected (Turner and Hester 1985). The Guadalupe tool found at
41MC345 (valley) dates to the Early Archaic (ibid.:216). Thus, the Early Archaic
manifestations come from all of the topographic settings delineated for this project area:
valley, upland margins and upland divides. At Choke Canyon, “low terraces along the
Frio River, its relict channels, and its larger tributaries became major zones of intensive
aboriginal settlement after 3500 B.C.” (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:464).
A Pedernales-like projectile point from the upland margin site 41AT77, Abasolo
points from 41AT81 (upland divide), 41MC102 (valley), 41MC345 (valley), 41MC344
(valley) and Tortugas forms from 41AT86 (upland divide) represent the Middle Archaic
Period (Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985) in the project area. Abasolo points are
thought to date from the Early to Middle Archaic in South Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:61) while Tortugas points possibly extend into this earlier period as well (Turner
and Hester 1985:152). Nueces bifaces from 41AT75 (upland divide), 41AT77 (upland
margin), 41AT86 (upland divide), 41MC103 (valley), 41MC348 (valley), 41MC349
(valley and upland margin), 41MC364 (upland margin) and a Nueces uniface from
41MC363 (valley and upland margin) date from the Middle to Late Archaic in South
Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:221). The Morhiss projectile point from 41MC350
(upland margin) dates from the Middle to Late Archaic in south Texas as well (Fox
1979:62).
Within the project boundary, the Middle Archaic manifestations are about as
numerous as the Early Archaic ones. There seems to be a slight shift in the settlement
pattern for this period as valley sites are preferred over upland margin or upland divide
sites. Choke Canyon Middle Archaic sites are located over all physiographic zones
present in the project area (Hall 1985).
The Late and “Transitional” Archaic in the project area is represented by an
Ensor-like dart point from 41MC345 (valley), two Fairland dart points from 41AT83
(upland divide/upland margin), a Desmuke dart point from 41AT83, Frio dart points from
41AT77 (upland margin) and 41MC367 (upland margin), and the Morhiss dart point
from 41MC350 (upland margin) (Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985; Hall, Black and
Graves 1982:288; Fox 1979:62). A Matamoros point found at 41MC366 (valley) and a
Catan point from 41MC108 (upland divide/upland margins) date from the Late Archaic

Artifact Analysis / 111
through the Late Prehistoric in south Texas (Turner and Hester 1985). Refugio points
found at 41AT75 (upland divide) and 41MC108 (upland divide/upland margins) are
Archaic but no further temporal designation can be assigned at this time (Turner and
Hester 1985:144). Upland margins are slightly favored locales for Late Archaic sites
within the project area. Once again, Choke Canyon sites for this period are located over
all physiographic zones (Hall 1985).
Late Prehistoric manifestations collected include Perdiz and Scallorn type arrow
points, several untypable arrow points and one prehistoric ceramic sherd. Scallorn
points collected were from 41AT77 (upland margins), 41MC345 (valley), 41MC357
(upland margins) and 41MC359 (upland margins). This type is associated with the early
part of the Late Prehistoric Period throughout most of Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:189; Hester 1980). During this portion of the Late Prehistoric Period, settlement
patterns appear to follow the trends favoring upland margin sites exhibited in the Late
Archaic. Perdiz arrow points were collected from 41MC104 (valley), 41MC346 (valley)
and 41MC347 (valley). During this later portion of the Late Prehistoric Period, the
settlement pattern has shifted again, with valley sites preferred over the other
topographic locales. The Choke Canyon Late Prehistoric manifestations are
concentrated in valley physiographic zones with valley margin areas exploited to a
lesser degree (Hall 1985); thus, a similar settlement pattern is exhibited for this period in
the Choke Canyon and San Miguel project areas. Non-typable arrow points were
collected from 41AT86 (upland divide), 41MC108 (upland divide/upland margins),
41MC347 (valley) and 41MC366 (valley). If the previously cited settlement schemes are
correct, then the non-typable points from the upland locales would date to the early Late
Prehistoric and the ones from the valley locales would date toward the end of the Late
Prehistoric Period. The ceramic sherd found at 41MC102 (valley) dates toward the end
of the Late Prehistoric (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:451; Hester and Hill 1975). The
location of this late artifact at a valley site further strengthens the proposed settlement
scheme for the end of the Late Prehistoric.
Lithic raw material in the project area is in a variety of forms. Chert, chalcedony,
petrified wood, quartzite, rhyolite, sandstone and some opalized wood were utilized for
various purposes by the aboriginals in this area. All of these materials except possibly
sandstone were used in the manufacture of chipped stone tools. Sandstone was utilized
in the preparation of food and possibly as anvils in an early stage of stone tool
manufacture.
The largest volume of lithic raw material in the area occurs just southwest of La
Jarita Creek at the southern boundary of the project. 41MC343, a lithic procurement
type site, is located here amid a large gravel outcrop which undoubtedly supplied much
of the raw material for this area. Chalcedony tools, debitage and raw material are
confined to the upland margins and upland divide. Petrified wood, quartzite and
opalized wood occur in all physiographic zones in small numbers, although most of this
material comes from the upland margins and upland divide. Specimens of rhyolite were
observed at 41MC343, 41MC344 and 41MC349, all located along the southern
boundary of the project. These sites are situated in either Salt Branch or La Jarita valley

112 / San Miguel Prospect
physiographic zones. Surface observations indicate that local high quality lithic sources
were utilized by aboriginals.
An observation, probably somewhat skewed by collection techniques, is that no
thick bifaces (>1.3 cm) were collected from Atascosa County, which consists only of
upland margins and divide physiographic zones. Although some thick bifaces were
observed in these zones, there definitely appeared to be a greater number in valley and
upland margins sites near the major tributaries in McMullen County. This fact may point
toward less initial lithic reduction occurring in the upland zones. The presence of roughly
equal quantities of collected cores from all physiographic zones contradicts this
hypothesis.
Lithic technology apparent from the artifact sample includes a flake industry
involving the splitting or halving of cobbles, a cobble industry involving bifacial reduction
from a cobble and a core-blade industry using flake blades detached unidirectionally
from a core (Hester 1975; Hester and Shafer 1975; Usrey 1980). The flake industry is
apparent in our sample from the relatively large number of tools made from split
cobbles. The initial cobble splitting is accomplished using a bipolar technique, that is,
the method of placing a cobble on an anvil and striking it with a hammerstone.
Additional edge trimming usually alters the original split cobble shape. The cobble
industry is apparent in the artifact sample through differing stages of bifacial reduction
represented and the presence of cobble cortex on many of these artifacts. The coreblade industry is poorly represented in our artifact sample by only a few unidirectional
cores. No blades were observed or collected; thus, this industry, thought to date to the
Late Prehistoric (Hester and Shafer 1975:175) was not a major lithic technology in the
area.
Artifact functions can only be generalized as no in-depth use wear analysis was
conducted. Lanceolate points, dart points, arrow points, scrapers, gouges,
spokeshaves, gravers, perforator/drills, manos, metates and hammerstones comprise
the tool inventory observed and collected for this project. Hammerstones were used to
chip raw material into tools or preforms. Projectile points were used in hunting and for
protection. Scrapers were most likely used in skinning and hide preparation. Gouges
and spokeshaves would have served well as woodworking implements. Gravers and
perforators/drills were probably used in hide working or decorations and manos and
metates served in food preparation.
The only identifiable mussel shell fragment from a prehistoric assemblage was
typed as Cyrtonaias tampicoensis, an inhabitant of a permanent water supply (Neck
1985). This shell fragment was collected from 41MC363 adjacent to La Jarita Creek. A
modern mussel shell from this creek, Uniomerus tetralasmus, is an inhabitant of
temporarily pooled water (Neck 1985). Unless the collected specimen was transported
to the site, the water supply to La Jarita Creek has been altered from prehistoric times
to the present. Possibly, La Jarita Creek flowed permanently during prehistoric times
until historic depletion of the ground water, climate or a combination thereof reduced the
creek to an intermittent stream.

Artifact Analysis / 113
In summary, the 426 artifacts recovered during this project have been grouped
into various artifact types and forms mainly from morphological considerations. Artifacts
representing Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods have been observed and
collected from surficial contexts and an attempt has been made to chronologically
distinguish as many artifacts as possible. Three lithic technologies present in the area
have been briefly discussed and possible changes in settlement pattern through time
have been suggested based on site physiography and diagnostic artifact distribution. It
should be recognized that the study area is limited in size, resource variability and
topographic relief. The suggestions offered herein can only be tested in the context of
broad, regional studies.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
PREHISTORIC SITE DISTRIBUTION
In 1975, Shafer and Baxter compared the distribution of sites in the original San
Miguel Lignite Prospect to Hester’s (1971) settlement model for Zavala County. The
1975 study area included portions of the perennial San Miguel Creek, the intermittent La
Jarita Creek, including its confluence with San Miguel, and upland areas bordering the
valleys. Briefly, Hester (1971) theorized that base camps in his Zavala County study
area would be found near resource-rich zones along well watered streams; from these
localities, hunting and gathering forays into the nearby uplands would rely on small
temporary encampments utilized on a short-term basis. Hester’s data was generated
primarily by survey and excavation in Zavala and northern Dimmit counties where
several now intermittent tributaries flow into the Nueces River. Hester (1978) found
long, narrow sites of predominantly Late Prehistoric age along the floodplain/riparian
ecotone, with resource procurement sites along the nearby gravel ridge. Archaic sites
were at mid-floodplain and adjacent uplands. Further into the less watered uplands,
smaller camps displayed minimal associated cultural debris with scattered hearths.
Shafer and Baxter (1975) considered sites of a multifunctional nature to
represent base camp sites where more varied activities would take place; limited
function and resource procurement sites were equated with Hester’s upland temporary
encampments. Their results indicate that multi-functional sites are distributed
throughout each zone of the study area and not confined to well watered creek side
habitations, even though the larger sites were found along San Miguel Creek and the
Lower La Jarita Creek. Consequently, Shafer and Baxter (1975:73) proposed “that the
prehistoric hunting and gathering bands could establish encampments anywhere that
water was available.”
Physiographic Zones
Although the study area is predominantly uplands, the 49 prehistoric sites in the
extended prospect can be categorized according to the two criteria established by
Shafer and Baxter (1975): physiographic zone and site type (Table 3). Three
physiographic zones are distinguished on the basis of minor relief. The site types,
multiple and limited function, are defined by the quantity and diversity of artifact
assemblage.

THE VALLEY
This zone includes the alluvial terraces and flats of La Jarita, Hog and Salt
Branch creeks. The zone is best represented by the La Jarita Creek drainage.
Elevations range from 280º AMSL along the modern floodplain to 310º AMSL on the
valley margins. The alley is broadest in the southern part of the study area (south of FM
791) where it spans 280 meters of eastern terrace flats and margin. At its narrowest, it
spans approximately 140 meters of western floor and margin. Vegetation ranges from a
thick riparian community bordering the lower terraces to scattered mesquite, oak and
prickly pear amid open grassland on the nearby flats between creek and toe slopes.
The valley margins to the north are covered with dense thorny brush, whereas those
margins south of FM 791 have been cultivated. Along Hog Creek, the vegetation is
mainly thick brush and mesquite and the terraces are not as well developed. Vegetation
along Salt Branch is scattered mesquite amid open pastureland set in shrink/swell clay
soils.
UPLAND MARGINS
These gentle slopes, broken by wide level flats, separate the valleys and upland
divide. Elevations range from 310º to 350º AMSL. Vegetation changes from dense
thorny brush on the slopes to moderately open mesquite grasslands on the flats.
Species of cacti, acacia and grasses are found scattered about the area. The underlying
clay soils are calcareous and highly susceptible to shrinking and swelling. Erosion has
been extensive; sheetwash and gullies have displaced the clay soils to expose caliche
and sandstone substrates. This is highly visible on the slopes where gullies have cut
deeply into the clays and substrates. The flats are more sheetwashed than gullied. The
dynamics of shrink/swell soils and erosion have greatly altered the context of cultural
material.
UPLAND DIVIDE
This zone encompasses a portion of the divide between the La Jarita Creek/San
Miguel Creek/Frio River Basin on the southwest and the Souse Creek/La Parita
Creek/Atascosa River basin on the northeast. The divide trends southeast from the
study area to the confluence of the Atascosa and Frio Rivers – the northern boundary of
the Choke Canyon study area (Lynn, Fox and O’Malley 1977; Hall, Black and Graves
1982). Only a 3 kilometer-long portion of the divide runs through the northwest corner of

Summary and Conclusions / 117
the study area. At its broadest, the divide spans 2 kilometers. Elevations range from
350º AMSL along the margin rim to 400º AMSL on knolltops. The gentle slopes and, in
some cases, broad flats are similar in vegetation, soils, and erosion to the upland
margins. In some cases, the flats resemble the open savannah postulated for Late
Prehistoric times (Hester 1975:116). Soils are predominantly shrink/swell, calcareous
clays. In some cases, 5 to 20 centimeters of topsoil over sandstone and caliche
substrates are exposed in gullies along the slopes and in broad sheetwash exposures
like those at sites 41MC108, 41AT85 and 41AT86. Here broad expanses, 15,000 to
200,000 meters square, of caliche shales and sandstones have been stripped of soils
by erosion. Based on 1946 aerial photographs (TNRIS), land here has not been
noticeably cultivated, but instead used for grazing and oil drilling. Transmission lines,
senderos, pipelines and oil rigs as well as ranch roads criss-cross the area, attesting to
the need for access through densely vegetated areas.
Site Types
Shafer and Baxter’s (1975:69-70) criteria were applied to classify sites recorded
during the present survey. A multifunctional site was defined on the basis of variety and
quantity of tools, indicating multiple activities. The majority of these sites contained
gouges or gouge fragments, (distally beveled bifaces and unifaces). Limited function
designation was based on generally smaller size and array of artifacts suggestive of
short term occupation and only occasional reuse. The resource classification has been
omitted from the current typology. These sites, though smaller than limited function
sites, are essentially the same: areas where specific resources were procured from
temporary, intermittent campsites in low density resource areas (Hester 1981).
MULTIPLE FUNCTION SITES
Twenty-eight of these sites were found in the study area. The array and quantity
of lithic cultural debris, the accumulations of burned rock and in some cases
subsistence remains reflect the high reuse and varied activities taking place at these
campsites. Although they are found in each physiographic zone, multiple function sites
cluster in the valleys and along the upland margins that rim the valleys. Even the sites
of this type within the upland divide zone trend toward the lower elevations, the juncture
with the upland margins. The mean areal dimension of sites in this category is 111.692
square meters, with a range between 2,250 and 537,600 square meters.
LIMITED FUNCTION SITES
Twenty-one of these sites were found in the study area. In contrast with multiple
function sites, the limited array and quantity of tools and burned rock are indicative of
sites where reuse was sporadic and occupations more transitory. Although they are
found in each physiographic zone, this type of site appears to cluster on the upland
margins. The mean areal dimension of sites in this category is 43.119 square meters,
with a range between 600 and 159,000 square meters.

118 / San Miguel Prospect
Findings in Each Zone
VALLEY SITES
Ten multifunctional and three limited function sites were recorded in the valley
zone. Temporal diagnostics suggest Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric occupations.
Though La Jarita Creek, Hog Creek and Salt Branch are now intermittent, the size of
many of sites along these drainages as well as the variety of functions indicated by both
observed and collected lithic artifacts and the high densities of burned rock indicate
reutilized campsites in the tradition of multifunctional, generalized resource areas (cf.
Lynn, Fox and O’Malley 1977). Hester (1981:120) suggests these are high density
areas where resources are more abundant because of perennial water. Mussel shell
was observed at 21 percent of the multifunctional valley sites. Snail shell was present at
several sites, suggesting its prehistoric utilization. Evidence for exploitation of various
fauna found in the uplands (bison and antelope) and valleys (small game) is
documented in Hester (1975, 1978) and Hall, Black and Graves (1982). In the study
area, a burned bone concentration at 41MC102 and burned bone found in a shovel
probe at 41MC347, both multifunctional valley sites, were the only faunal remains
recovered. Unfortunately, the pieces were inadequate for identification. Vegetal
processing is evidenced by a grinding slab fragment at 41MC341 and 41MC347. Lithics
are the most abundant of observed and collected artifacts. The array and quantity of
artifact types, such as distally beveled tools, dart points, arrow points, cores, choppers
and utilized flakes, at the multifunctional sites are indicative of several activities such as
woodworking, scraping, hunting, lithic reduction and flake tool manufacture. Collected
material suggests that more stages of biface manufacture are represented at sites near
or on the main drainages; distally beveled tools become more abundant with proximity
to main drainages. One explanation is the greater availability of cherts west of La Jarita
Creek and the redeposition of these same Pleistocene gravels in the La Jarita Creek
bed. Northeast of the creek, chert availability lessens and gravels are smaller but
palmwood and chalcedony increase.
UPLAND MARGIN SITES
Ten multifunctional and 15 limited function sites were recorded in the upland
margins. The temporal range of diagnostic projectile points from these sites suggest
Paleoindian through Late Archaic occupations. Several sites are multicomponent
(41AT77, 41MC364) and others heavily reutilized, suggesting campsites in adjustment
to seasonal conditions, such as flooding.
Sites found along the lower edges of upland margins bordering the La Jarita and
Hog Creek valleys are as large, if not larger, than the valley encampments. Their
multifunctional nature is well represented by the array of lithic artifacts and numerous
concentrations of burned rock. Further into the upland margins, the majority of sites are
limited function sites, usually along primary tributaries easily accessible from valley or
upland margin rim sites. Hester (1981) refers to these areas as low density resource
zones where encampments are dispersed, temporary and reuse is sporadic. Site
dimensions are smaller, as is the array and quantity of tools. Burned rock is less

Summary and Conclusions / 119
apparent. Increases in burned palmwood and worked chalcedony were observed at
these sites. These sites equate more with Shafer and Baxter’s (1975) limited function,
less-watered area sites than with Hester’s (1981) upland utilization sites since their
proximity to the valleys, less than one-half mile away, makes questionable the need for
a foraging camp so close at hand.
UPLAND DIVIDE SITES
Eight multifunctional and three limited function sites were recorded on the upland
divide. Temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric
occupations. Complete reduction manufacture is evidenced at the chalcedony chipping
station at 41MC108. The apparent reutilization of 41AT85 by the same group is
suggested by a large sandstone grinding slab. The stone, too large to be transported
easily, was found lying on the surface upside down with the grinding face to the ground.
This suggests reuse of a locale for processing of plant foods. A grinding stone was also
found at 41AT75, another upland divide site; other artifacts indicate hunting, scraping
and woodworking. The exploitation of the divide resources must have been seasonal,
focusing on specific resources, whether animal or vegetal, when available. In the
uplands, these would be restricted to wetter periods of the year. Based on present
climatic conditions, this would equate to spring and fall. Based on radiocarbon dates
and identified charcoal species, Dering (Hall, Black and Graves 1982:525), suggests
little drastic change over the past 2,000 to 3,000 years in the South Texas environment.
Therefore, basic subsistence components of the Choke Canyon and San Miguel areas
may only proportionally differ from those of Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic
times.
Relevance to Models
The pattern of prehistoric site settlement within the confines of the San Miguel
study area conforms to prior settlement models offered for hunters and gatherers in
South Texas. The comparison of physiographic zones and site types, used by Shafer
and Baxter (1975) as an extension of Hester’s explanation (1971), was utilized and
tested for sites in the present study area. More recent models have been presented
(see Archeological Background) to broaden the 1975 concept of settlement in the San
Miguel Prospect (Lynn, Fox and O’Malley 1977; Hester 1981; Hall, Black and Graves
1981; Campbell and Campbell 1981; Campbell 1983). Each offers a view of what can
now be looked upon as the overlapping settlement patterns in the San Miguel study
area.
In brief, the multifunctional sites (base camps) are found in each physiographic
zone, a pattern considered by Shafer and Baxter (1975) to indicate settlement in
response to availability of water. Yet sites of this type are larger and more numerous
along the La Jarita valley and valley rim. Based on size and scatter of cultural material
at these sites, they appear to be favored high density resource areas (Lynn, Fox and
O’Malley 1977) where scattered cultural debris and burned rock are the results of
numerous return encampments. Though larger multifunctional sites are found on the
valley rims in the upland margins, they lessen with distance from the valleys and rims.

120 / San Miguel Prospect
Artifact assemblages imply more limited functions, and probably more specific and
seasonal resource exploitation like those suggested by Hester (1971, 1981). The
relative frequency of multi- to limited function sites increases on the upland divide.
Though not as large nor as numerous as those on the valleys and rims, the multifunction upland sites do reflect resource exploitation in the less abundant, more
seasonally specific habitat. These sites conform to Shafer and Baxter’s (1975) and
Hester’s (1971) proposition that occupation is predicated on water availability. The
limited function sites on the divide are less numerous than multifunctional sites and may
indicate exploitation by smaller groups during off-season (less-watered) forays from
larger campsites, much like the satellite camps proposed by Hester (1971).
Results and Summary
The cultural resource survey of the San Miguel Lignite Prospect resulted in 49
prehistoric site recordings or reassessments and an evaluation of future research
potential. Ten sites found during a previous survey (Shafer and Baxter 1975) were rerecorded and evaluated; two of these sites have now been incorporated into 41MC106,
leaving only eight of the original ten. Of the new sites, 14 are in Atascosa County and
27 in McMullen. Sites are found in each of the designated physiographic zones. The
multifunctional sites are on the average larger in areal dimension and cluster along the
La Jarita Creek valley as well as the upland margin rims bordering La Jarita Creek, Hog
Creek and Salt Branch. Sites further up on the margins and upland divide become
smaller, yet retain multifunctional tool assemblages. Limited function sites are found in
each zone but cluster in the upland margins.
The overlapping settlement model suggested for the study area is based on
seasonal exploitation of the uplands during wetter periods (cf. Shafer and Baxter 1975),
when specific resources are available on the divide; increases in subsistence items,
whether animal or vegetal, presumably would correlate with the more abundant potable
water of spring and fall. At drier times of the year, such as winter or summer, these low
density zones (Hester 1981) with their limited resource yield, could only be exploited by
small groups emanating from larger camps along well-watered valleys, or microgroups
on a seasonal round. Those large encampments along the valleys and rims represent
areas where resources are more plentiful and available for greater lengths of time. They
resemble sites in Choke Canyon (Lynn, Fox and O’Malley 1977; Hall, Black and Graves
1982). Campbell (1983) indicates nineteen Amerind groups ranged between the San
Antonio and Nueces rivers, in the vicinity of the study area, at the time of contact. The
Prospect sites thus may result from seasonal movements through the study area,
similar to those suggested for the Mariames (Campbell and Campbell 1981).

Summary and Conclusions / 121
HISTORIC RESOURCES – THE BURMEISTER RANCH
Only one historic property, the historic component of site 41MC102, was
recorded during this survey. The physical remains are greatly disturbed by bulldozing
and root plowing (Fig. 18a). The land records in the McMullen County courthouse and
the county history issued by the McMullen County Historical Society (Austin 1981)
indicated that this site was the Burmeister Ranch headquarters, built by prominent
lawyer, rancher and politician Frank Burmeister in 1902. Interviews with local residents
and descendants of the Burmeister family led to Gustave “Butch” Burmeister who grew
to manhood on this ranch. His privately printed book Life on lajarita and personal
communication are the source of the following reconstruction of the family history and
ranch layout. Mr. Burmeister also provided photographs of his parents (Fig. 17) and the
house site cerca 1909 (Fig. 18b).
Frank Burmeister was born in Berlin on December 19, 1856. Educated in Berlin
and Zurich, he graduated from the University of Switzerland. In 1881, he emigrated to
New York where he found work as a coachman. When offered a job as a sheep herder
on the Taylor Ranch near Tilden, he accepted with alacrity. From that position, he
progressed to land surveyor and dam construction. He was appointed Deputy and then
County Surveyor, an office he held until 1892 while also studying law. In 1889, he
became a naturalized citizen and was admitted to the bar. After serving one term in the
House of Representatives in 1892, he was elected County Judge, then District Attorney.
In 1912, he was returned to the House, serving a total of five terms (1892, 1912, 1914,
1920, 1922).
In 1886, Frank Burmeister married Sarah Jane Russell (Fig. 17), daughter of
Charles and Emeline Russell. Sarah had been educated in St. Mary’s (now Bayside)
and, upon her father’s death, worked as a governess. Eventually, the family moved to
Tilden where Mrs. Russell opened a boarding house, assisted by her three unmarried
daughters. It was there that Frank and Sarah met.
By the turn of the century, the Burmeisters had acquired 2500 acres, largely east
of La Jarita Creek, where in 1902 they built their home on the house site 41MC102 (Fig.
18b). There the family prospered and grew. Frank Burmeister practiced law in
Pleasonton until disabled by a stroke in 1930. At his death, Sarah, who had managed
the ranch until this time, sold the final 200 acres of their property. She lived in
Pleasanton until her death in 1951. Shortly thereafter, the ranch house was leveled.
Gustave Burmeister (1984 passim) provides a vivid description of the ranch, its
operation and construction:
The Ranch House
The ranch house was built in stages and was finally developed into
a typical Southwest Texas ranch house. At first and before the family
moved out there permanently, a one room house with a leanto was built
along with a stone fireplace on the north side. This room provided shelter

for the family during the earlier summer visits. I suspect that cooking was
done in the leanto or on an open fire….
A little later five more rooms and a front porch were added. The
plan consisted of the first room which was the master bedroom, a similar
room to the south which was the parlor, and a third similar room further
south was the boys’ room. On the east side of these three rooms was a
porch running the full length of the house. On the west of these three
rooms was built the kitchen, the dining room and the girls’ bedroom. The
kitchen adjoined the master bedroom, the dining room adjoined the
parlour and the girls’ bedroom adjoined the boys’ room but had no
connecting doorway.
The walls were constructed of one-by-twelves standing straight up
and on the outside the cracks were covered with what was called batten, a
one-quarter inch by three inch board. The windows were all the same, four
glass units, two to the window and they were plentiful so that there could
be good circulation of air when needed and plenty of light. The floors were
of sturdy wood which took wear and tear well. One interesting thing, the
floors in the western three rooms were one step lower than the others….
The foundation of the house…was composed of hard mesquite
posts implanted in the ground.
When I was about four years old, weather boarding was added to
the north and south walls…then, later, about 1911, a back porch was
added. The porch extended the full length of the house on the west side…
Later on, a bathroom was built onto the north side of the kitchen. A
concrete floor was built in this room and covered with linoleum. A bathtub
was put in there but because there was no running water in the house, an
indoor toilet could not be installed…. There was an outdoor hydrant just
about 20 feet from the kitchen door.
The Outbuildings
Near the mainhouse was built what we called the smoke house. It
was a one room structure with a high roof ceiling and dirt floor. We used it
a few times as a smoke house…but later it was used for storage of odds
and ends.
Until about 1910 or 1911 we did not have much of a barn as we
used a log house to store corn and a brush shed-like enclosure for the
work horses, mules and milk cows. This was located just north of the
house…

Summary and Conclusions / 125
Soon after the railroad to Christine was built…we decided to build a
barn…. The barn was pretty big for that time and in that area…. Our barn
had a central driveway wide enough to drive a wagon through. On the
north side of this driveway was closed by two solid doors while on the
south were two slatted doors. On each side of the driveway which had a
dirt floor, was a large store room with wooden floors. These rooms were
for grain and other items to be stored. Overhead was a floored attic or loft
which could be used for storing hay, farm machinery or feeding livestock.
On the west side of the main barn was a long shed which had a solid wall
on the north side and a tin roof. This shed was used for protecting the
work horses and mules from the cold north wind and rain. In front of the
barn was a large pen which we used to hold the work horses and mules.
Just west of this layout were two pens which were used to hold the
milk cows and calves, and next to these pens was the goat and sheep
pen. The latter had a little covered room or shed to house young kids and
lambs during very bad weather. The fence around these posts were part
wire mesh and part logs laid between two posts….
In later years it became necessary to dip the cattle every 18 days to
kill the Texas fever tick. Every ranchman had to build a dipping vat which
was about three feet wide, ten feet deep at the front end and with a
stairstep construction at the other end. The vat was constructed with
concrete and had to be water tight….
Our vat was built right next to the barn on the east side and leading
to it from the pen was a “chute”, a narrow passageway just wide enough
for one cow to pass through but not wide enough for her to turn around.
About a mile north of the barn were two more pens constructed of
mesquite logs laid between two posts. These pens were just inside the
main pasture and were used for the summer roundups…also in the fall.
The pig pens were located just west of the ranch house, past the
woodpile and bordered on a small lake formed south of the main dam
where they had scooped out the soil for the dam.
The poultry yard was located between the reservoir and the goat
and sheep pen.
The Waterworks and Garden
The Lajarita also provided water for cattle and other livestock…. A
large dam was constructed on the Burmeister property. It formed a lake
covering about ten acres and backed water up the channel for about two
miles.

126 / San Miguel Prospect
The dam was constructed of earth scraped out of a basin which
then became a lake…. On the west end of the dam, which was about 200
yards long, was constructed a spillway out of concrete…. When the
Lajarita started flooding, the spillway simulated a small waterfall and the
roar gave us notice that the creek was rising….
The lake thus formed covered 10 to 15 acres and with the channel
about two miles long….
…two other tanks or lakes we had constructed on a couple of
gullies southeast of the ranch house.
…there was always plenty [of water] for us all as long as the
concrete spillway held, the lake never was dry. But some years later,
unfortunately a huge flood occurred and washed the spillway out and
drained the lake. The spillway should have been repaired but the expense
seemed too great so only a large segment of the broken concrete
remains.
After the spillway was washed out, Papa had a smaller concrete
dam built below the main dam and where our road to the west crossed the
creek. This dam was quite low and was constructed so that it could be
used as a bridge-like crossing. This dam still stands….
…during periods of drought and when all of the stock water had
given out we made the cattle drink water we dipped from the well which
we dug in the bottom of the Lajarita. The water flowed from a vein of
lignite coal and had a peculiar taste. Neither man nor beast liked it as it
came directly from the well but after a few hours the bad taste
disappeared…. We noticed that after a week or so the cattle would lose
the ticks and shed their old coat of hair.
South and east of the house was about 15 acres fenced for a
garden and orchard…this was made possible by an irrigation system
supplied by the water from the Lajarita.
From the lake, water was pumped into a raised earthen reservoir by
a windmill at first and later by a gasoline engine. The reservoir was about
50 by 100 feet in area and about six feet deep. Later a second one of
similar size was constructed and connected to the original by a large pipe.
From the reservoir water was piped to an irrigation ditch which proceeded
east along the garden fence just north of the house and then south to the
garden area south of the house. This ditch, about one foot wide and nine
inches deep, was the main waterway and from this, side ditches carried
the water to areas to be watered. Thus the garden and fruit trees were set
up in blocks that could be treated separately….

Summary and Conclusions / 127
On the south side of the house was a rose garden….
The front porch…was protected from the sun by a row of large
chinaberry trees.
Burmeister (1984) gives a detailed account of farming, ranching,
hunting, fishing, social activities and general life on La Jarita Creek. Using
his description as a guide, the ranch layout can be reconstructed.
Landmarks still visible are the well in La Jarita Creek, the earthen tanks,
the broken concrete of the larger dam, the smaller dam, the dipping vat
and adjacent chute remnants, and a concrete slab, probably the bathroom
floor. The piles of building debris generally define the location of the
farmstead. These remains have been recorded by this survey and it is
improbable that further work can improve upon the information provided
by Gustave Burmeister. Although the property was undoubtedly that of
locally prominent personages, the current condition of the site detracts
from its National Register of Historic Places eligibility.

SITE SIGNIFICANCE
Previous attempts to derive meaningful prehistoric patterns from sites such as
those in the San Miguel Prospect have frustrated researchers for the past decade
(Shafer and Baxter 1975; Usrey, Grysinski and Bond 1978; Usrey 1980; Hall, Black and
Graves 1982). The efficacy of systematic surface collections and their relevance to
larger research issues have been questioned in the light of three factors, one physical
and two cultural.
Cultural processes have had a synergistic and destructive effect on intra-site
patterning. Using Gunn’s (Gunn and Mahula 1977) analogy derived from information
theory, the ability of the archeologist to decode signals sent by the prehistoric peoples
through the channel of time depends on the skill of the transmitters and receivers, and
the amount of static introduced through time.
Factors which affected the encoding of the information we now seek to interpret
can be seen in the ethnohistoric and archeological record. Campbell, in his summary of
Cabeza de Vaca’s and Alonzo do Leon’s descriptions of two geographically separated
Coahuiltecan groups concludes that:
…those who have attributed so much cultural uniformity to the
Western Gulf province have overemphasized the generic similarities in its
hunting and gathering cultures and have paid little attention to the
recorded evidence that indicates cultural differences. (Campbell 1983:351)
If we assume that this spatial variability has some time depth, it is obvious that
overlapping territories of groups with different approaches to hunter-gatherer
adaptations could be overlain at any given site. This would be most apparent in the
context of the wide-ranging territories attributed to South Texas cultures. The San
Miguel Prospect could easily be but one small area traversed during seasonal
movements, the overriding causal factor in nomadic settlement patterns. Small
vacillations within any segment of this round could be in response to such minor
considerations as seasonal water flow, insect infestations, fuel supply, variable plant
densities, isolated hunting forays, accumulated waste or social concerns. In the
absence of temporal controls and stratigraphic separation, varying cycles of reuse
obscure any discrete patterns left by earlier occupations.
In addition, the observation of Lynn, Fox and O’Malley (1977) that the long linear
sites paralleling the water courses result from the return of small social units to a
generalized high-density resource area and not to a specific locality is appropriate to the
study area sample. If the San Miguel sites were only one stop on a round dedicated to
the exploitation of seasonal or restricted resources, the full range of activities would not
129

130 / San Miguel Prospect
be represented during each episode. Many of the sites in the Prospect demonstrate
reuse over long periods of time. Thus, the encoded message consists of pages torn
from several books, perhaps written in different languages.
This message is further scrambled by physical processes, undoubtedly operative
throughout prehistory and accelerated during historic times. In most of the sites, erosion
has displaced the majority of the cultural evidence, either compacting time onto a single
surface, or dispersing the artifacts and features. The patterns now discerned are the
work of nature and not culture.
The soil dynamics typical of the Prospect clays further distort the distribution of
cultural material. Shrinking and swelling are the vertical displacers; the impermeability of
the clay when wet accelerates the force of runoff and consequent horizontal movement.
Preservation of fauna and flora is poor, limiting reconstruction of past environments and
identification of subsistence resources.
Modern populations have exploited the end result of these natural and prior
cultural processes. Formal artifacts exposed by erosion are easily seen and collected.
One Prospect landowner accumulated 300 projectile points from property included in
this survey. In addition, one of the best known collectors in the region, Graves Peeler,
whose 80 or 90 thousand item collection was given to Texas A&I, lived only a few miles
from the Prospect. Thus, it can be assumed that the temporally and functionally
diagnostic tools left for the archeologist are not representative of the full range of
prehistoric remains.
The final contribution of our cultural system to site destruction is modern land
use. The response to the invasion of thorny brush which impedes vehicular traffic has
been senderos, roads, and general clearing which in turn accelerates erosion.
The combined effects of natural and artificial disturbance has, in our opinion,
rendered further study of 28 of the 49 sites in the Prospect unproductive. Discouraging
as the prospect of gaining meaningful information may seem in the light of previous
experience in this upland region, 21 of the San Miguel sites may retain some limited
potential (Table 4). If these sites are to be affected by surface mining, this potential
should be further explored.
Hall (1985, personal communication) argues most persuasively that future work
in the South Texas cultural area should be dedicated toward the well-stratified or buried
single component sites that can take archeological studies beyond the superficial
elaboration of chronology and settlement patterns. Unfortunately, no such sites have
been identified in the San Miguel Prospect, nor are they likely in this environment.
However, given the inevitable loss of the sites in the mining zones, some additional
effort should be made to extract a sample of the cultural residues from those that will be
affected. The recommended measures are thus intended as data-recovery devices.
The 21 sites adequately sample all the physiographic zones delineated in the
Prospect. By definition, multi-functional sites are more productive in terms of artifact

Site Significance / 131

132 / San Miguel Prospect
assemblage and possible features or concentrations, but some limited function sites are
included. The sites are listed below by physiographic zone and in decreasing order of
evaluated information potential. The disposition of further work at these locations is
contingent upon the finalized mining plan.
The depth of culture-bearing strata at valley sites varies but never exceeds 80
centimeters. At the request of TARL, Morrison-Knudsen geologists assessed the
geomorphology of the Prospect to identify the potential for Recent deposition that might
conceal archeological sites. “No Holocene (10,000 years B.P.) alluvial, terrace or
windblown (eolian) surficial deposits were penetrated in the SMLM II area based on
close-spaced exploratory drilling data” (Dick 1986). The limited areas amenable to
subsurface testing are residual pockets that have eluded erosion. Possible preservation
of Late Prehistoric materials is indicated by fragmented bone at 41MC102 and
41MC347; other possible subsistence items, mussel and snail shell, should be collected
for species identification to determine the prehistoric water flow or sources of shellfish.
Although organics suitable for radiocarbon assay would be a fortuitous find, buried
intact hearths of appropriate lithological makeup may be suitable for
thermoluminescence dating. In addition, some formal tools may be recovered from
subsurface contexts where exposure and redeposition have not obliterated use wear
scars. The extreme dynamics of the clay soils typical of the valleys, however, suggest
that individual artifacts will not easily be associated with any buried features.
In conjunction with subsurface testing, additional surface collections can be
made. The upland divide and margin sites, with the exception of 41AT87, are totally
surficial. The value of systematic or statistically-derived approaches to surface collection
is certainly questionable (Usrey 1980) and these are not recommended. Rather, the
mapping of concentrations, such as the remnant hearths at valley site 41MC349, and
the collection of formal tools, their locations plotted on site maps, should be continued
and refined at the recommended sites if they are threatened by mining activities. In
some instances, individual camping events or activity areas may retain sufficient
integrity to be discernible amidst the overall scatter.
Testing and targeted surface collections of the San Miguel prehistoric sites would
require no more than two weeks at any given location. This additional assessment
should be sufficient to confirm our initial opinion that none of the sites are eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The one historic component at
41MC102, the Burmeister Ranch, is now only a flattened scatter of structural and
household debris (Fig. 18a). The history of the ranch ownership, its layout and
associated activities have been reconstructed from the account of Gustave Burmeister
(1984), youngest son of Frank Burmeister, legislator, lawyer and rancher. The site was
unquestionably connected with prominent local personages but its archeological
potential has been severely damaged by bulldozing, root plowing and 40 years of
abandonment and it is unlikely that further testing would produce significantly more
detailed information. However, the prehistoric component of 41MC102 has been
recommended for testing and materials relevant to the early 1900s occupation may be
recovered at that time.
