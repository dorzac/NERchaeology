ABSTRACT
An intensive cultural resources survey on a 134 acre proposed mixed use development on
property owned by Read King Commercial Real Estate within at the intersection of Harlem Road
and the Grand Parkway in Fort Bend County, Texas was conducted by Brown and Caldwell on
February 28, 2008. The property is currently used as an agricultural field and, historically has
been used for that purpose. Construction activity planned at the site includes the building of new
roads, retail shopping, office and warehouse space, and multi-family housing. A number of
detention ponds and underground utilities will be installed throughout the property. A surface
survey identified one area of brick fragments in a small area (20 x 40 m) in the center of the
property. A metal spike and an angled metal fragment were also observed in this area. One
shovel test was excavated within the observed limits of this brick scatter. In addition to the
shovel test within the surface scatter, 11 other shovel tests were excavated within the property.
Other than within the small brick scatter, no artifacts were recovered in any of the shovel tests.
Other than within the brick scatter, no historical cultural materials or features were observed
during the surface survey. It is recommended that no further archaeological work be conducted
on the property and that construction be allowed to proceed.

INTRODUCTION

This report documents an intensive cultural resources survey on a 134 acre proposed
mixed use development on property owned by Read King Commercial Real Estate within at the
intersection of Harlem Road and the Grand Parkway in Fort Bend County, Texas (Figures 1 and
2). Brown and Caldwell conducted the cultural resources survey of the area of proposed effect
(APE) on February 28, 2008 according to the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The property is currently used as an agricultural field and, historically has been used for
that purpose. Existing conditions of the property include an underground pipeline corridor, an
over head powerline corridor including three towers on the property, maintained dirt roads, and a
stock pond with associated irrigation and drainage ditches. Construction activity planned at the
site includes the building of new roads, retail shopping, office and warehouse space, and multifamily housing.

A number of detention ponds and underground utilities will be installed

throughout the property.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located just outside the 500-year floodplain of the Brazos
River/Oyster Creek, approximately 1400 m (4600 ft) north of Oyster Creek. The APE is
situated in the typical coastal plain environment. The property is a maintained agricultural
field that had been plowed under for the winter. Vegetation in the area consists of sparse
weeds except in one small area to the south which was not plowed and within the drainage
ditch running to the stock pond.
The soils on the property are characterized by the National Resources Conservation
Service as Lake Charles Clay or Bernard Clay loam. The property is well drained, but
contained some areas of standing water. The major feature on the property is a long stock
pond which, from historical aerials, was constructed between 1985 and 1995. A raised ditch
runs between the pond and Harlem Road. Other, shallow diches run along the center and
edges of the property. A raised dirt road runs along the southern edge of the property and
another bisects the property running north to Morton Road.

An underground pipeline

corridor containing at least two pipelines (as noted by the pipeline markers on the edge of the
property) runs from the midpoint of the southern edge of the property northwest to the
northwest corner. A large overhead powerline runs to the north-northwest on the eastern half
of the property. Three towers from this powerline are located on the property.
The project area lies within a strip of land known as the Coastal Prairie and Marsh
physiographic province (Fenneman 1938). The Coastal Prairie and Marsh zone runs along
the coast stretching inland about 80 km. Ten major geomorphological features characterize
the Coastal Prairie and Marsh zone: upland prairies, rivers, floodplains, freshwater streams,
freshwater marshes, meander belt ridges, saltwater marshes, saltwater lagoons, gulf beaches,
and the open gulf.
The climate of the area is warm, temperate, and humid and is heavily affected by the
Gulf of Mexico. Summers are hot and dry with an average high temperature of 82.6Â°F with
temperatures rising into the high 90s during the day. For most of the year, prevailing winds
are from the south and southeast bringing warm, moist air into the area. During the months
of October through January, winds blow from the north. Average temperatures during the

P:\Read King Commercial Real Estate\134979 - Grand Pkwy Arch Surv\Deliverables\Reports\001R-Phase 1 Cultural Resources Survey-RK GrandPkwy.doc

6

winter range around 54Â°F, but cold air masses can sweep through the area rapidly dropping
the temperature into the freezing range.
Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year with a yearly average of 279 cm
(43.2 inches).

Extreme weather conditions such as thunderstorms, tropical storms and

hurricanes can sometimes bring quick, heavy rainfall. Due to the proximity to the gulf, fog is
a common occurrence.
The climatic history of the Texas coast is not well known. Although pollen records
have not produced useful information, some studies have been able to make assumptions
about the paleoenvironment. Aten (1983a:135-136) presents information for a high stream
discharge around 10,030 B.P. (before present). He then suggests that precipitation was
reduced between 8490 B.P. and 5060 B.P. (Aten 1983a:136). These conclusions match ones
by Bryant and Shafer (1977) and Bryant and Holloway (1985) for central Texas and
conclusions by Delacourt and Delacourt (1979) for the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. Aten
(1983a:136) suggests that modern conditions could be found along the Texas Coast after
5060 B.P.
Species common in the area today were also available in the past (Ensor et al.
1983:16). Mammals in the area include deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossum, rabbits, skunks,
and gophers.

Riparian species include freshwater mussels and snails, alligators, many

different species of fish, turtles, and snakes. Bison and antelope did occasionally enter the
upland prairies near the coast and could have been exploited by people in the area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

A review of the site files held at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory,
Austin, Texas, indicates that five archaeological sites have been recorded within 1,000 m
of the proposed APE. Three of the sites are prehistoric sites with lithic material recorded.
One site is a large site with both prehistoric and historic components including prehistoric
pottery. The fifth site is a historic church and graveyard.
3.1 Previous Studies
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area
surrounding Galveston Bay (Wheat 1947, 1953). The research done during that project
initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay Focus and the development of a cultural
sequence of the region based on lithics and ceramics (Aten 1983a:10). Later work at
Wallisville (Ambler 1970, 1973; Aten 1965, 1983b) helped refine the early ideas and led
to a better understanding of the prehistory in the area. The cultural context of the upper
coastal region is described by Aten (1983a:140-307), Freeman (1990: 367-384), and
Story (1990:163-366). This information is merged with the archaeological data here to
give a complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
3.2 Archaeological Background
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000 B.P.
and ends near 9000 B.P. (Aten 1983a:141; Story 1990:176-211). This period is poorly
represented in the archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983a:146) and no sites
for this period have been verified.

Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura,

Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and Golondrina point types (Aten 1983a:152). Sites
from this period would be either buried by alluvium or found in upland sites. Subsistence
during the Paleoindian period included both hunting and gathering although there was
probably an emphasis on hunting. The population during this period was highly mobile
in response to the movement of food sources.
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9000 B.P. and ends around 7500
B.P. (Aten 1983:145-152; Story 1990:Figure 33). This period is also poorly represented
by the archaeological work in the area, but isolated finds of Bell/Calf Creek, Early-Side
Notched, and Early Expanding Stemmed dart points are attributed to this time period.

P:\Read King Commercial Real Estate\134979 - Grand Pkwy Arch Surv\Deliverables\Reports\001R-Phase 1 Cultural Resources Survey-RK GrandPkwy.doc

The Archaic period is thought to include a shift towards a diet more geared towards plant
processing, but still including hunting. Plant processing technology seen during the
entire Archaic period includes stone lined hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools
(Story 1990:213). Groups began to travel over less of the landscape and population
density seems to rise.
Beginning at 7500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983a:Figure 9.1), the
early Archaic period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have
been destroyed or deeply buried (Aten 1983a:152-155; Story 1990:222). In situ early
Archaic remains have been found at Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the
area (Story 1990:222). Points from this period include Bell, Carrollton, Trinity, Wells,
and Early Stemmed. It is possible that the Carrollton, Trinity, and Wells points continued
to be used into the middle Archaic (Patterson 1996).
The middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving
shell middens (Aten 1983a: Figure 9.4, 155).

These middens contain remains of

shellfish, such as oysters and estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic
vertebrates, and the earliest known human burials in the region (Aten 1983a:155).
Characteristic projectile points include Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The late Archaic lasted from 3000 to 2000 B.P. and shows evidence for
population increase (Aten 1983a:Figure 9.1, 157-159). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this
area was essentially like the modern climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials
from southwestern Arkansas and found in context with human burials in cemeteries such
as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the possibility of trade (Hall 1981:289-309). Projectile
points differ from earlier periods in that they are corner-notched or expanding-stemmed
forms, such as the Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain types. Other types can be found, such as
the un-notched Pamillas. These types are thought to precede the Gary type which can be
found into the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990:Figure 33, 222-223). During the late Archaic,
more utilitarian biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools.

Late Archaic

assemblages are very similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (Aten
1983a:159).
The transition from the late Archaic period to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by
the introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983a:272-282, Figure 15.2; Aten

P:\Read King Commercial Real Estate\134979 - Grand Pkwy Arch Surv\Deliverables\Reports\001R-Phase 1 Cultural Resources Survey-RK GrandPkwy.doc

9

and Bollich 1969: Figure 3). Cultural shifts during the Late Prehistoric include the
possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major technological changes, such as
sandy paste ceramics and, late in the period, the bow and arrow (Story 1990: 243). The
cultural tradition during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast has been
designated as Woodland.
Story (1990:256-258, Figure 39) has suggested the use of the term Mossy Grove
Tradition to define cultural patterns of the region. The Trinity River seems to be a
dividing line in this tradition with cultures east of the river being more similar to those in
Louisiana than to those west of Galveston Bay. The eastern tradition also seems to have
begun earlier than that in the west, beginning about 2000 B.P. and lasting 600 years (Aten
1983a:272-282, Figure 15.2; Aten and Bollich 1969:Figure 3; Story 1990:255).
Story (1990:258) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into five distinct time intervals
on the coast, while noting that only two are found inland. Aten (1983a:282-290) defined
these intervals as the Clear Lake (1850-1525 B.P.), Mayes Island (1525-1300 B.P.),
Turtle Bay (1300-950 B.P.), Round Lake (950-600 B.P.), and Old River (600-250 B.P.)
periods based on ceramic styles.
Early ceramics from this area are similar to Tchefuncte period wares found near
Sabine Lake and into Louisiana and include sandy paste varieties such as Mandeville
Plain, Goose Creek Plain (Anahuac variety), and Tchefuncte Plain (Aten 1983a:287-288;
Story 1990:246). These early sites appear similar to pre-ceramic sites due to the low
number of ceramic sherds found. The appearance of sandy paste and sand-tempering
occurs about 1900 B.P. with the OâNeal Plain (variety Conway) being a good example
(Aten 1983a:Figure 15.1). Rocker-stamped decorations and incised wares are common
distinctive markers for this period (Aten 1983a:290).
3.3 Historic Background
Historic settlement in Fort Bend county occurred in the 1820s with a land grant to
Moses Austin by the Mexican government in 1821. After Moses Austin died the same
year, his son, Stephen F. Austin was allowed to continue the colonization (Wharton
1939). The original 297 grantees are known as the âOld Three Hundredâ; 53 of these are
located within Fort Bend County (Ott 2001).

P:\Read King Commercial Real Estate\134979 - Grand Pkwy Arch Surv\Deliverables\Reports\001R-Phase 1 Cultural Resources Survey-RK GrandPkwy.doc

The first group of Austinâs settlement sailed from New Orleans on the schooner
Lively in 1821. After anchoring at the mouth of the Brazos River, they traveled up the
river to a bend where they built a blockhouse for protection in 1822. The community
which grew around this fortification became known as Fort Bend (Wharton 1939). Fort
Bend was eventually abandoned during the Texas Revolution when Santa Annaâs army
marched across the Brazos River on their march to the battle of San Jacinto. When the
area was resettled the next year in 1837, Richmond was established as the new
community in the area (Leffler 2001).
Property tax records show that the APE is located on property once owned by
William Morton who was one of the âOld Three Hundredâ. Morton arrived in Texas
from Mobile, Alabama in 1822. Their boat was wrecked on Galveston Island and Morton
met up with passengers from the Lively with whom he traveled up the Brazos River to
present day Fort Bend County. Morton was granted 1.5 leagues and one labor of land on
July 15, 1824 (Handbook of Texas Online (HTO) 2008). The census in 1826 listed
Morton as a farmer and stock raiser. He had a wife, Jane, three sons, two daughters, one
servant, and two slaves. Morton was drowned in a flood on the Brazos River in 1833
(HTO 2008).
In 1860, Patrick Perry owned Mortonâs League and ran a plantation with 33
slaves. Perry had come from North Carolina and lived on the plantation along with his
wife and children (Jach 1999). Mortonâs League was eventually purchased by the State
of Texas and used as part of the Harlem Prison Farm system.
After the Civil War, plantation owners did not have the advantage of slave labor
and were upset in the reduced production on their farms.

In response, the Texas

Legislature instituted the âBlack Codesâ in an effort to control the labor of freed blacks in
the State (Rice 1971:7). Part of the law allowed convicts to earn a credit of $1 toward
their fines for every day worked. Anyone who agreed to pay a convictâs fine was entitled
to his labor to pay for the fine and any interest owed. This resulted in the systematic
imprisonment and âsellingâ of freed blacks throughout the State (Oshinsky 1996:21). In
1871, the State began leasing prisons to private companies and individuals who were then
able to lease out the prisoners to area farms and companies (Jach 2001).

11

The prison leasing system was designed to bring in revenue for the State, but an
economic downturn and social distaste for the conditions at leased prisons in the 1880s
caused the State to look for alternatives. The State decided on purchasing their own
farms for convicts to work, basically putting all control over the system in State hands.
In 1886, the State purchased the Harlem Plantation in For Bend County and established
the Harlem Prison Farm (Jach 2001).

METHODS

The APE was surveyed according to the Archeological Survey Standards with an
intensive survey consisting of the systematic survey of the well pad and the pipeline
ROW using a combination of surface survey and shovel test methods. Ground surface
visibility was extremely good throughout much of the APE as it is a plowed field. The
surface survey of the well pad was done at 30 m intervals.
Shovel tests were excavated to determine the sedimentation patterns and identify
possible subsurface cultural material. Shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 100 cm
(39 in) and all sediment excavated from the tests was screened through 0.625 cm (0.25
in) in mesh or trowelled (if thick clay) in search of cultural material. The survey also
included an overview of the area surrounding the APE in order to characterize the
probability of cultural resources being located within the APE.

RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the entire APE was conducted on
February 28, 2008. A surface survey was conducted over the entire APE. Overall the
surface visibility ranged from 30 to 100 percent and averaged approximately 80 percent.
One small area of the APE was thickly covered with vegetation and had no surface
visibility. The APE is a plowed field and, mainly well drained, though some areas of
standing water were encountered in the furrows. Overall, no pebbles, rocks, or shell
fragments were noted during the surface survey. A few modern items that are associated
with current agricultural activities were noted during the surface survey. The surface
survey also noted very infrequent cobbles and one shell fragment within an
approximately 80 m corridor along Harlem Road.
During the surface survey one area of brick fragments was observed on the
surface in a small area (20 x 40 m) in the center of the APE (Figure 2). A metal spike
and an angled metal fragment were also observed in this area. One shovel test was
excavated within the observed limits of this brick scatter. Brick fragments extended
throughout the plow zone (approximately 45 cm), but no other artifacts were recovered.
The pond within the APE does not have a dam. It has been excavated to below the
normal grade. A low berm surrounds the pond and the ditch running between the pond
and Harlem Road. No outlet structure was observed. Because historical aerial photos
show the pond as being constructed between the years 1985 and 1995, it is not considered
a historical feature.
In addition to the shovel test within the surface scatter, 11 other shovel tests were
excavated within the APE. Two of these shovel tests were excavated within a small area
containing thick vegetation (Figure 2). The others were spaced throughout the APE to
provide a sample of the entire project area. In general, shovel tests for the entire APE
consisted of dark gray clay from 0 to 100 cm. A notable consistency change occurred at
approximately 45 cm deep indicating the extent of the plow zone. Some shovel tests
encountered a layer of dark gray clay including calcium carbonate nodules at
approximately 60 cm deep. Some shovel tests also encountered reddish yellow mottling
within the top 30 cm. Shell fragments and pebbles were rare.

Other than within the small brick scatter, no artifacts were recovered in any of the
shovel tests. Other than within the brick scatter, no historical cultural materials or
features were observed during the surface survey.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

A review of the Texas Historic Commission Site Atlas indicates that there are five
recorded archaeological sites within 1000 m (3281 ft) of the APE. These archaeological
sites are located a sufficient distance away from the APE and will not be affected by the
proposed construction. The brick scatter located within the APE did not contain any
other significant cultural material. It is possible that the bricks were used to improve the
roadway on the APE or for some other purpose and the time period in which the brick
were used could not be determined.
Due to the lack of evidence indicating past human activity (other than that
associated with modern agriculture) and the presence of some disturbance associated with
modern agriculture, it is recommended that no further archaeological work be conducted
on the APE and that construction be allowed to proceed.
