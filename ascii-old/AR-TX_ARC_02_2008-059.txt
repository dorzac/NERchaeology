ABSTRACT

The City of Sherman intends to construct approximately 30,605 feet of
new wastewater pipeline and two lift stations north of Sherman in Grayson
County, Texas east and west of US 75. The proposed pipeline route,
including the lift stations, begins at FM 691 and terminates north of East
Pecan Grove Road in Sherman at an existing pipeline route. During the
middle part of July of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
archaeological survey of the proposed pipeline route and lift stations for
the Greater Texoma Utility Authority which is designing the pipeline route
for the City. Since the City of Sherman is a political entity of the State of
Texas, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4882 for the archaeological survey. No cultural materials
older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in 23
shovel tests. The results of the survey are similar to other archaeological
surveys in the Blackland Prairie.
Based on the survey, AR Consultants recommends that no further cultural
resource investigations are warranted and that the City of Sherman be
allowed to proceed with the construction of the pipeline route and lift
stations. If buried cultural resources are uncovered during construction,
work should cease in that area, and the Texas Historical Commission
immediately should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Sherman intends to construct approximately 30,605 feet of new wastewater
pipeline and two lift stations north of Sherman east and west of US 75 in northern
Grayson County, Texas. The proposed pipeline route begins adjacent to FM 691 and runs
southwest and uphill and terminates prior to encountering the intersection of East Pecan
Grove Road and North Travis Street where it connects with an existing sewer pipeline
(Figure 1). The City of Sherman has requested that the Greater Texoma Utility Authority
design the proposed pipeline. Greater Texoma Utility Authority contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey along the
proposed pipeline route and of the two lift stations. Since the City of Sherman is a
political entity of the State of Texas, a Texas Antiquities Permit was required. Also, the
City of Sherman will receive funds from the Texas Water Development Board. The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4882 for the archaeological survey.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials were
present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and determine how
they might be impacted by construction. Since an unnamed tributary to Iron Ore Creek is
present and may contain Waters of the United States which falls under the purvey of the
US Army Corps of Engineers, possible relevant federal legislation includes Section 404
Permit for the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,”
and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800),
Appendix C.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area. This is followed by a short discussion of Grayson
County archaeology in the project area and a brief history of the area. A discussion of the
methodology and the research designs follows. The results of the field investigation are
presented in the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude the text. A list of
references cited is at the end of the report.

NATURAL SETTING
The study area is in central Grayson County and in the Blackland Prairie (Diggs,
Lipscomb and O’Kennon 1999). For more than a century, these upland prairies have been
extensively farmed and this has resulted in erosion and modifications to the natural
landscape that are hard to imagine looking at today's cultivated fields and transportation
routes.
Soils within the study area belong to the Fairlie-Austin-Houston Black Soil Association
which consists of nearly level to strongly sloping upland clays (Cochran 1980:General
Soils Map). The dominant soils are Sanger and Vertel clays (Cochran 1980:Sheets 25 and
32). The underlying bedrock consists of the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford
Formation which consists mainly of shale and Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1967). The intermittent tributary to Iron Ore Creek is not mapped as containing
Quaternary alluvium nor does it have an extensive floodplain. It is mapped as perennial.

CULTURE HISTORY
The Blackland Prairie in Grayson county have received little archaeological
investigation, although major work was done in conjunction with the construction and
subsequent raising and maintenance of Lake Texoma. In 1941-1942, A WPA team from
the University of Oklahoma carried out an archaeological survey of Bryan and Marshall
counties in Oklahoma. The subsequent survey of the Denison Dam area was done in a
period of three weeks, although it was noted that survey of the 146,000 acre lake area
would have taken six months to a year (Kelly ND). Kelly noted that sites decreased in
number and significance as the survey team moved westward from the dam site, and that
the most important sites were in the vicinity of the junction of the Red and the Washita
Rivers. The Lake Texoma reconnaissance only recorded four archaeological sites. No
major work was done in Texas as a result of this major construction project until the lake
level was to be raised in the early 1970s. At this time, the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project from The University of Texas at Austin (Prewitt and Larson 1972) recorded 158
archaeological sites.

The earliest occupation in Grayson County is attributed to the Paleo-Indian period based
on the discovery of Clovis and Folsom dart points (Bever and Meltzer 2007:68). The
subsequent Archaic occupation is not well documented, but is more widely understood
based on surveys and reports from avocation archaeologists. The post-Archaic occupation
is related to a marginal Plains adaptation, and has been described by Krieger (1946) as
the Henrietta focus in Texas. Although evidence of historic Native American occupation
is known in adjacent parts of Oklahoma, very little is known about this time period
archaeologically in North Central Texas (Skinner 1988).
Grayson County and indeed many of the counties bordering on the Red River have
played an important role in the Anglo-American settlement of Texas. It has been
suggested that settlers began arriving in the county as early as 1835 (Webb 1952:726).
During the Republic of Texas, two forts were established in Grayson County, one at
Preston Bend and the other, Fort Johnson, a few miles north of Pottsboro. In 1846,
Grayson County was created from Fannin County and named for Peter W. Grayson.
Sherman was ultimately selected as the county seat in March of 1846.
Previous Investigations
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner and Baird 1987) conducted an archaeological survey of a
pipeline route for the Greater Texoma Utility Authority approximately 3 miles west of
the proposed pipeline route (Figure 2). Site 41GS113 (the Goode/Porter Cemetery) was
recorded during the survey. AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2002) also conducted an
archaeological survey of a pipeline route for Greater Texoma Utility Authority that
begins basically where the proposed pipeline route terminates but no archaeological sites
were recorded.
In 1974, Southern Methodist University (Ferring 1974) conducted an archaeological
survey of the Choctaw Creek Watershed approximately 1.35 miles southwest of the study
area (Figure 2). Site 41GS105 which is a lithic and fire-cracked rock scatter was recorded
on the east bank of Pecan Creek was recorded.
No archaeological sites are listed within or adjacent to the study area on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (2008) and no residences are plotted on the 1958 USGS map.
Wendy Lopez & Associates, Inc. (Greaves 2001) investigated a pipeline route that
crosses a portion of the unnamed tributary to Iron Ore Creek near Fallon Drive and the
proposed pipeline route (Figure 2) but did not discover any archaeological sites.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Based upon the upland setting away from perennial water and the low biotic diversity, no
prehistoric sites were expected to be found. Since historical sites are not tied to perennial
streams since cisterns and wells were used for water supply, historic sites may be
encountered in a variety of settings. No doubt, historic residences became tied to historic
transportation routes such as trails and later roadways over time. Although historic
transportation routes appear to be present on the USGS map and historic sites are usually
______________________________________________________________________________________

present along those routes, it is believed that historic sites might be present in the
proposed pipeline route or lift station since historic transportation routes are present.

Figure 2.

Location of surveys discussed under Previous Investigations.

The proposed pipeline route is approximately 30,605 feet long with a right-of-way of 20
feet with an easement of 15 feet on each side that extends beyond the right-of-way. The
lift stations are 20x20 feet is size.

Shovel tests were excavated on a judgmental basis along the proposed pipeline route and
lift station locations in the upland setting as recommended by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002). However, shovel tests were excavated along the tributary to Iron
Ore Creek wherever a generally level spot was encountered. Shovel tests were excavated
to approximately 30 cm below the ground surface. Shovel tests were not excavated in
good (30-60 percent) or excellent (60-90 percent) ground visibility. The clay was not
screened but was broken manually and visually inspected for cultural materials as were
the pit walls. Notes on the terrain, vegetation, and other relevant data were made and
photographs were taken. Since no floodplain was present along the intermittent tributary
to bury and preserve cultural deposits, deep testing was not done.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into several parts. The survey area is described and
then followed by a discussion of the survey. Conclusions derived from the survey in the
chapter. Shovel tests are plotted on Figures 7, 8 and 10 and are described in Table 1.
Survey area
The terrain ranges from generally level to steeply sloping and forested areas (Figure 3)
alternated with improved/unimproved pasture (Figure 4) except for the southern
approximately one mile which ran through urban Sherman. Trees include eastern red
cedar, hackberry, mesquite, American elm, winged elm and oak while understory
vegetation consists of saw greenbriar, grape vine, prickly pear cactus, bermuda grass,
johnson grass, broomweed, blood weed, hog brush and other grass species.
Eye-height visibility ranged from excellent in the improved/unimproved pasture but
ranged from 10 to 30 meters in the forested areas. Ground visibility usually was at least
30 percent. Since most of the proposed pipeline route is to be constructed on slopes,
erosion has been the dominant factor which provided excellent ground visibility that
usually was 70 percent (Figure 5).
The intermittent tributary to Iron Ore Creek ranges from 4 to 6 m wide and 2 to 10+ m
deep (Figure 6). The steepest portions of the creek occur on elevated areas where shallow
sandy loam overlies the Eagle Ford Shale bedrock. Occasionally, limestone within the
Eagle Ford could be seen outcropping in the creek’s banks. First order drainages into the
tributary range from 2 to 6 m wide and 1 to 4 m deep. Water was present from recent
rains but was ponded although the drainage is mapped as perennial. The substrate
consists of sandy loam with shale and pea-sized limestone gravel. No buried cultural
deposits were noted in any of the drainages’ banks nor were knappable lithic materials
found in the drainages’ channels
The survey
Due to the various alignments of the proposed pipeline route, the discussion of the survey
is divided into 3 parts, A, B and C which are shown on Figures 7, 8 and 10.

Part A
Part A consists of the lift station south of and adjacent to FM 691, the proposed pipeline
route south of FM 691 and the portion of the pipeline route that runs southwest of FM
691 to south of Blue Flame Road and then returns to FM 691 (Figure 7).
The portion of the proposed pipeline route south of and adjacent to FM 691 was visually
surveyed and no standing historic structures, historic features or exotic plants were seen
and no locations likely to contain prehistoric sites were noted. Shovel test 1 was
excavated in the center of Lift Station 1 which is on a bench of a northeast-southwest
trending ridge. The shovel test uncovered 27 cm of yellowish-brown (10YR5/4) clay
which is listed as the B horizon for the Altoga series (Cochran 1980:54).
Shovel tests 2 through 4 were placed adjacent to the intermittent tributary. Shovel tests 2
and 4 encountered clay that extended to 30 and 33 cm bs. Shovel test 3 uncovered 17 cm
of sandy clay overlying the sandy clay B horizon that ranged to 31 cm bs. Shovel tests 5
and 6 were excavated on knoll and encountered 30 and 33 cm of sandy clay. Shovel test 7
was excavated on a level area adjacent to the tributary and uncovered 36 cm of clay. At
this point, the archaeologists crossed a first order drainage and walked the proposed
pipeline route back to US 75 where the pipeline route ran back northeast to FM 691. No
shovel tests were placed adjacent to the first order drainage due to the slope of the terrain
and the excellent ground visibility.
The proposed pipeline route then runs northeast paralleling US 75 back to FM 691.
Shovel test 8 was excavated on a bench on a ridge adjacent to the residence shown on the
USGS map. The shovel test encountered 35 cm of sandy clay. The residence is outside
the pipeline route but examined anyway. A fence was present but no residence was seen.
Shovel test 9 was excavated on a bench and 34 cm of black clay was encountered and
Shovel test 10 also was excavated on a bench and uncovered 34 cm of sandy clay. The
last one-fourth mile of route going northeast had been bulldozed.
Shovel tests 1 through 10 were culturally sterile and no cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface in Part A despite the good to excellent ground
visibility. No buried cultural deposits were noted in any of the drainages’ banks.
Part B
Part B (Figure 8) begins where A leaves off and runs southwest and terminates prior to
encountering US 75. Two ancillary routes project from the main pipeline route to US 75,
one which goes to Loy Lake Road and Lift station 2 is to be constructed next to Fallon
Road which the pipeline route crosses. The route runs through alternating
improved/unimproved pasture and forested areas. Four shovel tests (Shovel tests 11-14)
were excavated along the main pipeline route and uncovered clay from 31 to 35 cm bs
except for Shovel test 14 which encountered limestone bedrock 3 cm bs. Shovel tests
were not excavated along most of the route due to the slope of the terrain which is shown
in Figure 8 and the resulting good to excellent ground visibility.

locations plotted on a portion of the Sherman NW, Texas 7.5’ USGS map.
Overlaps with Figure 8.

The northernmost ancillary pipeline route parallels a dirt two-track road to US 75. No
shovel tests were excavated along the route due to the good to excellent ground visibility
and limestone bedrock outcropping onto the ground surface.
Lift station 2 is to constructed adjacent to Fallon Road and Shovel test 15 was excavated
in the center of the tract. The shovel test uncovered 31 cm of clay.
From the first ancillary pipeline route, the archaeologists walked to where the proposed
route terminated just east of US 75. No shovel tests were excavated due to the ground
slope and good to excellent ground visibility.
After reaching where the route terminates, the archaeologists then returned to the
southernmost ancillary route and walked it to Loy Lake Road. Five shovel tests (16
through 20) were excavated along the drainage the pipeline route paralleled and
encountered clay ranging from 27 to 37 cm bs.

No buried cultural materials were noted in any of the drainages’ banks or found on the
ground surface despite the good to excellent ground visibility. No buried cultural
materials were discovered in 10 shovel tests either.
Part C
Part C (Figure 10) runs southwest from Loy Lake Road to where the proposed route
terminates north of East Pecan Grove Road. Shovel tests 21 and 22 were excavated on
both banks of the first order drainage that flows into Iron Ore Creek’s tributary. The
shovel tests encountered 31 and 26 cm of loamy clay containing decayed limestone
bedrock. The northern half of the proposed pipeline route crossed improved pasture,
recently mowed hay field and forested areas along drainages. The forested areas ranged
from a meter to 10 meters wide. Shovel test 23 was excavated on the west bank of a first
order drainage and uncovered 34 cm of clay.
Where the proposed pipeline route turns west (Figure 10), the pipeline route skirts a tank
and from this point to where the route terminates was not shovel tested due to disturbance
from the construction of a shopping mall, a housing development and well pad sites
(Figure 11). Also, ground visibility ranged from good to excellent.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or buried in the
drainages’ bank walls. No buried cultural materials were discovered either.
Conclusions
As expected, no prehistoric sites were discovered, probably due to the upland setting
away from perennial water. The occurrence of site 41GS105 is interesting. The site is
located near the headwaters of Post Oak Creek. The drainage is mapped as perennial as is
the tributary to Iron Ore Creek (which was not verified in the field). Without further
archaeological sites to indicate a settlement pattern, the occurrence of site 41GS105 is
hard to explain. The site may have been a well-preserved temporary camp which the
aboriginal inhabitants of Grayson County occupied on their way to the Red River. The
site also could have been an overnight hunting camp as well, but temporary in nature,
nonetheless. Prehistoric sites possibly were not along the tributary because it was not as a
well-developed secondary drainage as Post Oak Creek.
Historic sites were not found either probably because the land was preferred to be used
for farming/ranching. In addition, a conscious effort by Greater Texoma Utility was made
to avoid any standing historic structures or features.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey was to determine if cultural
materials were present. None were, and based upon this finding, AR Consultants
recommends that clearance be provided to the City of Sherman to construct the proposed
pipeline route and lift stations without further cultural resource investigations. We further
recommend that if buried cultural resources are uncovered during construction, work
should immediately cease in that area and the Texas Historical Commission should be
advised of the discovery.
