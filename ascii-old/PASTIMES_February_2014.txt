Part III

View to the southeast from the bluff top showing the escarpment and the beginning of the Palo Duro
Canyonlands. The easternmost limit of the site is in the foreground.

Miscellaneous
Several pieces of miscellaneous brass, iron, and lead materials from the site were collected and recorded. Some of these have yet to be identified, so they may or may not be associated with the 1872 battle.
As stated previously, agricultural artifacts of a more recent manufacture and present-day debris were not recorded.

Conclusions
The site area has been greatly impacted not only by nature but also by man. It is safe to say that over
the past century plow zone movement has shifted all of the recovered artifacts from their original locations.
What remains unique is that there was still a definite pattern of occupation at the battle site. The portion of the
site containing large amounts of spent military cartridges seems to suggest that only an outer segment of the
encampment was actively engaged in the battle. Still, the question remains as to why more artifacts were not
recovered from the overnight encampment of more than 225 military personnel and livestock traveling with 38
wagons. Were these other artifacts washed away by previous floods or collected in the past by other individuals? The small number of Kiowa projectiles at the site – limited to two .50 caliber bullets, three percussion
balls, and three .32 caliber rim fire cartridge cases – may confirm a report that most of the Indian’s gunfire was
aimed high. The use of muzzle loading weapons by the Indians may also explain the lack of more Indianassociated cartridge cases at the site. The night attack was probably only an attempt to harass the troops by
stealing the military livestock. It is likely that the Indians retreated from the battle once they realized they
were not only outnumbered but also outgunned.
The military artifacts recovered at this Randall County site and the terrain that matches Colonel
Gregg’s records provide reasonable evidence that it is the location of the 1872 battle between Kiowa Indians
and Colonel John I. Gregg’s Eighth Cavalry.
Acknowledgements
This material was originally presented as a paper at the annual meeting of the Southwestern Federation
of Archeological Societies. In 2004 the paper was published as Historical Background and Archeological Investigations at the Col. John I. Gregg Battle Site (41RD77) in Transactions of the 39th Regional Archeological
Symposium for Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas. We would like to thank the Midland Archeological Society for permission to publish this revised report in the Steward.
The cooperation of the landowner as well as neighboring landowners is essential for any survey of this type.
We could not have been more pleased with the landowners who allowed us access to their property: Vicki and
Terry Funk; Edward Burgess, whose property contains a known military trail that descends from the north;
Hugh Lackey, land tenant of the Blackburn family’s property, which extends to the east and to the south of the
site; and Myrl Goodwin, on whose property we located the 1872 Gregg battle site.

Mr. Goodwin’s support included mowing areas of the site with heavy vegetation and informing us in
advance of construction projects, which included excavation of a stock pond and trenching for a water pipeline
across the site. During the latter stages of our investigations, Mr. Goodwin and his brother Earl obtained permission to donate a day of their time to lead the researchers into eastern New Mexico to the former location of
Fort Bascom and the general area of Colonel John I. Gregg’s 1872 Summer Camp for the Eighth Cavalry by
the Canadian River. Mr. Goodwin’s support never once faltered during the many trips made onto his property
in search of the battle site. We especially appreciate the enthusiasm he expressed at the end of each day as we
reviewed our finds and his plans to donate the collection of artifacts to the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, where they will be available for future studies.
We also extend our thanks to Texas Historical Commission Archeologist Brett Cruse for his advice,
assistance in the field, and technical assistance in producing the artifact distribution map. Especially to our
wives, Nadyne Lynn and Sidney Shaller, we express our deep gratitude and love. They understood the importance of our research, provided technical assistance, edited countless drafts of this report, and had evening
meals prepared regardless of how late we returned home from the field.
We will forever be thankful to all these individuals for their support in making this project a success.
