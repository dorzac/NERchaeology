Report #326
August 2014

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed Endo-Hall cellular Tower site in western Donley County, Texas. The Federal
Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1)
requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided
by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is
5,625 square feet (<0.13 acres).
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on August 16, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
Two individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are Ms. Jayne Aaron, Architectural
Historian and Senior Environmental Planner at AARCHER, Inc., and Mr. Bill Martin, Federal
Programs Reviewer at the Texas Historical Commission’s Office of Historic Preservation.

(TAAI) to conduct
an archaeological
investigation of the

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In August 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the western portion of Donley County in the Texas Panhandle, within
the Great Plains region, with the northern part of the county in the High Plains area and the
southern part in the Rolling Plains. However, the proposed Emdo-Hall Tower lies just north of
Clarendon, and just below the High Plains area, near the Caprock escarpment. The High Plains
are highest in their southern most portion, on the Llano Estacado plateau, with elevations
reaching over 3,200 ft above mean sea level (amsl). Running from the northern portion of the
Texas Panhandle southward into Central Texas, the Caprock escarpment forms an abrupt
boundary between the flat Llano Estacado and the deeply incised and rapidly eroding Caprock
Canyonlands along its eastern edge. The Caprock Canyonlands become less rugged and incised
as the easterly flowing rivers broaden their valleys, and enter the Lower Plains region,
encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges (Boyd 1995; Parsons 1967; Carroll 1996).
The topography of Donley county is typified by an undulating nearly level to rolling landscape
with predominately rangelands on loamy and dry soils. Elevation in Donley county ranges from
2,075 feet to 3,265 feet above mean sea level from the southeast to the northwest (Abbe and
Anderson 1996; Williams and Crump 1980).
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as subtropical, with an average annual
rainfall of about 33 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 97 degrees in July, to around 37 degrees
in January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent
droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 253
days (Abbe and Anderson 1996; Williams and Crump 1980).
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the Endo-Hall Tower is to be constructed in Miles loamy fine sand (20),
commonly found on nearly level to slightly undulating uplands in this area of Donley County.
Because of the location of these fine sands, much of the surface layer has been removed by soil
blowing. Otherwise, a typical soil pedon of Miles loamy fine sand consists of very friable light
reddish brown fine sandy loam to about 7 inches below the surface. Below that, to about 17
inches below the surface is friable and mildly alkaline reddish brown sandy clay loam and loamy
fine sand. From roughly 17 to 64 inches below the surface is friable, mildly alkaline, reddish
brown sandy clay loam. The underlying soil, from 64 to 80 inches is friable, moderately alkaline,
yellowish red sandy clay loam (Williams and Crump 1980; Websoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the Endo-Hall Cellular tower survey area presumes cultural affinities and
influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but
differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into
northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval,
or period) of the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and
more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate
and given as years before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
r a d i o carbon d a t e s
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years
were later disproved as
dates on natural coal Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
( S t a n f o r d Black 1989a).
1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
5

bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the area was used more frequently in the
6

Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other
game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities
were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
"few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
7

Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968a, b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Donley County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.

Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and
the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following
the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (e.g., Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).

9

A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the Endo-Hall cellular Tower site had not been
subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any documented surveys or
archaeological sites within one mile (Atlas 2014; see also, Figure 3). However, as shown in Figure
3, there are three National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties and seven historical
markers to the southwest, in Clarendon; they are briefly described below.
NRHP Properties
Clarendon Motor Company Building – The Clarendon Motor Company Building serves both as
a reminder of the prosperity of the ranch economy around which the town prospered in the 1920s,
and also as an example of the distinctive architectural forms adopted by the first car dealers in this
country. Thus the significance of the building is twofold; it stands both as a symbol of the goals
and aspirations of a then growing community and also as a fine local example of Mission Revival
architecture.
Martin-Lowe House – The Martin-Lowe House was built in 1904 by F. D. Martin. His wife Nellie
S. Martin owned a very fine mercantile store and was energetic in civic activities. Also, he and
his wife added much to the musical and social life of the community. In 1926 R. H. Muir, Sr., sold
the house to S. W. Lowe and wife Lilac, and this was to be the Lowes' home for the next fifty-six
years.
Donley County Courthouse and Jail – Located on the public square in Clarendon, the courthouse
building was constructed in 1890. In Romanesque Revival style, the courthouse is a fine
picturesque work incorporating polychromatic masonry. Walls of the 1890 temple were St. Louis
pressed brick placed upon a base of quarry-faced ashlar, the stones of which, according to one
local historian, were taken from an earlier courthouse. Stone was also used for the arches, lintels,
and decorative features. On the ground story cut stone was employed for the watertable, pinnacle
shafts, and lintels.
The Donley County Jail is located on the northwest corner of the public square, near the
courthouse. Built on stone footings, the walls of the jail were of Millsap and Vernon brick,
completed in 1904. That same year, lightning rods, electric lights, and water and sewage systems
were installed. In 1907 porches were added to the north and south sides. Although the utilities
and other interior features have obviously been remodeled, the exterior still retains most of its
original character.

Historical Markers
Donley County – Formed from Young and Bexar territories; Created August 21, 1876; Organized
March 22, 1882; Named in honor of Stockton P. Donley 1821-1871; a Confederate officer
elected to the Texas Supreme Bench in 1866; Clarendon, the County Seat.
S.W. Lowe House – Local merchants J. G. and F. D. Martin built this house in 1904. Rancher
James M. Calhoun owned the property from 1910 to 1914 and cattleman Robert H. Muir from
1914 to 1926. Muir sold the residence in 1926 to Sam W. Lowe, a college educator, merchant,
stock farmer, and civic and church leader who served three terms as Donley County judge. Lowe
died in 1968, but his wife of 53 years, Lilac, continued to occupy the house until 1981.
Church of St. John Baptist – Oldest church continuously in use (in earliest Episcopal parish) in
the Texas Panhandle. The first services were held by the Rev. Mr. Townsend of Dallas Diocese
in the J. B. McClelland Ranch house, Nov. 1877. On site given 1891 by Isaac W. Carhart,
building was erected in 1893. A donor, Mrs. Elizabeth Goff of Philadelphia, chose the name. The
church was consecrated April 24, 1893, by Bishop A. C. Garrett. First Vicar: the Rev. W. D.
Sartwell, 1890-93.
Stockton P. Donley – County named for Texas Confederate Stockton P. Donley, 1821 - 1871.
Came to Texas from Kentucky 1846. Dist. Attorney 1853. Enlisted private 7th Tex. Infantry
1861, made Lieutenant. Captured with regiment after bitter fight at Seige Fort Donelson
Tennesse, 1862. Prisoner of war 9 months at Camp Douglas Illinois. When exchanged, his health
was so broken that he was assigned post duty. Elected to State Supreme Court, 1866. Because
of Confederate service, was removed in 1867 by U.S. military order. A memorial to Texans who
served the Confederacy.
First United Methodist Church of Clarendon – When the Rev. Lewis H. Carhart, a Methodist
minister, founded Clarendon, he envisioned it as a religious and educational center. The town was
established in 1878 near the junction of Carroll Creek and the Salt Fork of the Red River, six
miles north of its present location. Local cowboys nicknamed the settlement "Saint's Roost"
because it had no saloons. The first building erected was a combination church and school. Until
the turn-of-the-century, there was a Northern Methodist Church in the community. When the
railroad arrived in 1887, Clarendon moved to its present site. The Rev. James T. Hosmer, a
circuit rider, conducted Methodist services in private homes. In 1888 the Rev. Isaac L. Mills and
15 charter members organized the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1890 the fellowship
erected a frame church building on the southeast corner of Kearney and 4th Street. Membership
increased significantly after the founding in 1898 of Clarendon Methodist College, forerunner of
Clarendon Junior College. To accommodate the growing congregation, this large classical revival
structure was built in 1910, during the pastorate of the Rev. O. P. Kiker. The original roof was
replaced in 1950.
Donley County Courthouse – Designed by the architectural firm of Bulger and Rapp, and built
11

by Troutman Brothers Contractors, both of Trinidad, Colorado, this distinctive public building
opened in November 1891. The original Romanesque Revival design included prominent towers,
contrasting red brick and quarried limestone, and complex projecting elements. Work in the 1930s
resulted in removal of the entire third floor, as well as many architectural details. The county
restored the courthouse to its original splendor and rededicated it on July 4, 2003. Today, it is
the oldest functioning courthouse in the Texas Panhandle.
The Clarendon News – The town of Clarendon began with an effort led by the Rev. Lewis H.
Carhart as he strived to create a colony based on Christianity, temperance and education. To
promote the settlement, he created The Clarendon News, publishing the first issue in June 1878,
the same year the first colonists arrived. The News was the first newspaper in the Panhandle.
Since its first printing, it has changed owners and names many times but has always provided local
news coverage and community interest pieces. As the community grew, printing methods changed
from hand-set type to 21st-century computer innovations. The newspaper’s long, continuous run
is a tribute to Carhart and the many pioneer journalists who followed him.
As of August 16, 2014 there were 28 documented archaeological sites in Donley County, and
together they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over the
past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian period, perhaps as long as 11,500 years ago.
Sixteen of these 28 sites were documented in 1959 by legendary archaeologist Jack Hughes
during his survey of the Greenbelt Reservoir area for the National Park Service. Of the 28 sites,
21 are prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian through the early Historic
periods. Notably, on more than a few of these sites archaeologists have identified evidence of
Antelope Creek phase encampments and villages. The Antelope Creek phase coincided with the
presence of large herds of bison on the Southern Plains, and three sites have been categorized as
bison kill sites.
Only one site has been categorized as a lithic scatter, consisting of chipped stone debitage where
Native Americans have not camped, but have manufactured stone tools from the abundance of
lithic raw materials on the surface. Three sites are categorized as historic in age; they are
41DY17, 41DY26 (both described below), and 41DY24, the townsite of Old Clarendon.
Exceptional sites that have merited State Archeologiocal Landmark (SAL) designation within
Donley County include the Greenbelt Site (41DY17), the Lelia Lake Dugout (41DY26), and the
Donley County Courthouse in Clarendon (described above).
41DY17 - Greenbelt Reservoir Village Site (41DY17) – This a Panhandle Aspect pit house
village with dozens of houses. It was designated a SAL in 1994.
41DY26 - Lelia Lake Dugout (41DY26) – This is a dugout cut into an embankment, and
apparently utilized by the Ft. Worth and Denver City Railway sometime between 1885-1920. It
was designated as eligible as a SAL in 2005.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the
archaeological
survey, the area
to be impacted
had been clearly
delineated with
survey stakes
(Figure 6). In
Accordance
with Texas
Historical
Commission
(THC) and
Council of
T e x a s
Archeologists
( C T A )
Archaeology
S u r v e y
Standards, a Figure 6. The tower footprint was clearly delineated with survey stakes
systematic and (facing southwest).
t h o r o u g h
pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests
were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan, all
redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed
in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated
at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

13

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the tower footprint area appeared to have been heavily disturbed due to
plowing and discing, and the landowner (Mr. George Hall) stated that he had just collected baled
straw from the field the day before the survey. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, surface visibility
ranged between 50-80 percent across the site, and the entryway from CR 12 crosses a bladed bar
ditch and iron pipe fence. Very widely scattered, rounded chert and quartzite gravels (probably
Ogallala) to golf ball in size were observed on the surface, some with apparent plow/disc damage.
Six shovel tests placed within the tower’s footprint and entryway from CR 12 (Figure 7) revealed
friable light reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam to about 5 centimeters below the surface
(cmbs), with few maize rootlets and occasional and few rounded quartizite gravels to golf ball in
size. Below that, from about 5-45 cmbs was friable but crusty brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy
clay loam with few, small (<1 cm) soft calcium carbonate masses. From roughly 45-60 cmbs was
weak red (10YR 4/3) silty loam, crusty and semi-firm.
The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in either of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 80% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric
nor historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant,
and by the Texas Historical Commission.
