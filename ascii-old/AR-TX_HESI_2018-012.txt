MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 19 January 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed
University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project located in south-central Loving County, Texas
(Project Area). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded and will not require
any federal permitting or coordination. However, it is located on property owned by the
University of Texas (UT). As UT is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of
Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the
Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed,
to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 8326.
The Project Area consists of: 1) a drill pad measuring 3.4 acres in size; 2) an attached
production pad measuring 1.4 acres in size; 3) an attached reserve pit measuring 0.4 acres in
size; and 4) an access road totaling 1657.0 feet (505.2 meters [m]) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1
m) wide (1.1 acres). Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 6.3 acres situated entirely
on UT Land.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed well
pad project relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Anadarko
Petroleum Corporation’s (Anadarko) proposed University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project
located in south-central Loving County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded and will not require any federal
permitting or coordination. However, it is located on property owned by the University of Texas
(UT). As UT is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and,
if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
The Project Area consists of: 1) a drill pad measuring 3.4 acres in size; 2) an attached
production pad measuring 1.4 acres in size; 3) an attached reserve pit measuring 0.4 acres in
size; and 4) an access road totaling 1657.0 feet (505.2 meters [m]) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1
m) wide (1.1 acres). Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 6.3 acres situated entirely
on UT Land.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator,
while Jacob Lyons (Horizon staff archeologist) conducted the field investigations. The cultural
resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit
number 8326.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 15 February 2018. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the surface of the Project
Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects totaling between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

As the Project Area totals 6.3 acres, a minimum of 13 shovel tests were necessary within the
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 17 shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed well
pad project relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the proposed well pad and
access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and UT should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Anadarko’s proposed University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project is located in southcentral Loving County, on the south side of County Road (CR) 247, approximately 8.3 miles
(13.4 kilometers [km]) east of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute Soda Lake NW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The
Project Area consists of: 1) a drill pad measuring 3.4 acres in size; 2) an attached production
pad measuring 1.4 acres in size; 3) an attached reserve pit measuring 0.4 acres in size; and 4)
an access road totaling 1657.0 feet (505.2 m) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (1.1 acres).
Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 6.3 acres situated entirely on UT Land.
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 and 2-2.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in south-central Loving County in far West Texas. It is
situated within an area of undulating desert hills dotted with numerous playa basins and
unnamed drainages that are linked to Soda Lake and the Pecos River (see Figure 1-1).
Elevations within the Project Area range between 2790.0 and 2800.0 feet (850.4 and 853.4 m)
above mean sea level.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Pecos River basin. It is drained to
the east by overland sheet flow into a nearby playa basin.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Loving County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
49.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
79.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 12.4 inches (31.5 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between May and October (NRCS 1999).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair notes that portions of
Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now drained by the
Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the Chihuahuan Deserts
ecoregion, the Project Area is situated within geologic formations composed of sand sheet and
caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities dominate the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland.
The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline playa margins plant
community include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp. (seepweed), Salicornia
spp. (pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The dominant species associated
with the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia
spp. (blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s jointfir). The dominant species associated
with the desert shrubland plant community include Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia
cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca), Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia
rigidula (blackbrush), Cylindropuntia leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla
(lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens (cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the Paleoindian (pre-8500
B.P.), the Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000
B.P. to 3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early Paleoindian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the Paleoindian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.

HJN 160006 AR 75

9

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the
recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices
also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2018). Similarly, a
review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google
Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the
review perimeter (NPS 2018). No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the
NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources
surveys have been undertaken within the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resources to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite.
This site, 41WR1, is located approximately 5.7 miles (9.2 km) southeast of the Project Area in
Winkler County, Texas.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
Project Area on an elevated landform to the west of a playa basin, it was Horizon’s opinion, prior
to the field efforts, that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased potential
for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area on
15 February 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
across the surface of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 2 shovel tests per
acre for projects totaling between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As the Project Area totals 6.3
acres, a minimum of 13 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply
with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests
across the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD
83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in
Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 19 January 2016, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of
Anadarko’s proposed University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project located in south-central
Loving County, Texas. The development of the Project Area will be privately funded and will not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, it is located on property owned by UT.
As UT is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the
regulations of the ACT. At the request of Whitenton, Horizon conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and,
if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The cultural resources survey was
conducted under TAC permit number 8326.
The Project Area consists of: 1) a drill pad measuring 3.4 acres in size; 2) an attached
production pad measuring 1.4 acres in size; 3) an attached reserve pit measuring 0.4 acres in
size; and 4) an access road totaling 1657.0 feet (505.2 m) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide
(1.1 acres). Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 6.3 acres situated entirely on UT
Land.
The cultural resources survey consisted of intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing across the surface of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per acre for projects totaling between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As the Project
Area totals 6.3 acres, a minimum of 13 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in
order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17
shovel tests across the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 17
excavated shovel tests.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
University Lands 19-7 B 2H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed well
pad project relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the proposed well pad
project, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and UT should be notified of the discovery.
