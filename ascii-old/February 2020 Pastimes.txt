PANHANDLE ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
Minutes of January 15, 2020
The meeting was called to order by President Erin Frigo at 7:00 p.m. in the Amarillo Downtown Library.
There were 10 persons in attendance.
PROGRAM: The program for the evening was “A Thousand Site Legacy: Digitizing PPHM Archeological Site
Records” by Andy Burcham. Andy started with a brief discussion of the history of how the PPHM recorded sites
starting in the 1950s. There are around 1000 sites not formally recorded with the state. His ultimate goal is to get
these sites both in the museum database and recorded with the state. This is no small feat for him as there are
450 topo sheets for the twenty-six counties in the Texas Panhandle and two collections of these topo sheets that
he has to look at to record the sites. He starts with digitizing the sites from a topo sheet onto TOPO!. He then
compares these to the state records using Google Earth to see if the site already has a trinomial. Then compares
how close the site is to a known trinomial using Excel to do computations using the distance formula. He is 42%
completed with the county maps. He also shared some useful Google Earth “add-in” tools: USA Topo-MapsSlider (slider that makes the satellite image go to topo map with varying degrees of transparency); USGS Quadrangles tool (lays out 7.5 quads over map and identifies them); and Soil Web tool (gives soil types for the area, if
you click on the abbreviation it gives information on the soil type).
MINUTES: Rolla suggested a correction to the past meeting’s minutes of changing Brett Cruise to Brett Bowsman. The minutes were then approved with this correction. Rolla motioned and Elaine seconded.
TREASURER’S REPORT: There is a total balance of $7,356.37. $4,000 of that came from our share of the
TAS annual meeting and minus the amount given to the Studer Banquet speaker. Elaine motioned for this to be
approved and Rolla seconded.
PUBLICATIONS REPORT: Rolla reported that there was a balance of $2,441.97 in the regular account and in
the CD there was $5,239.20.
MARKETING: The Facebook has 103 likes. Twitter and Instagram accounts have been set up. The Instagram is
Pan_Arch_Soc. The society has also been put on the list for the Prairie Palooza at Palo Duro Canyon.
OLD BUSINESS: There was no old business.
NEW BUSINESS: Southwest Federation is being hosted by the PAS at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
on April 4th. There needs to be a committee to do goodie bags – brochures and items like that. Paul and Rolla
are taking care of abstracts and publication. Be thinking about who else can help with getting refreshments and
stuff for give outs. Rolla suggested to waive the registration fee and for PAS to underwrite the fee of the meeting
since we have the money to cover it. This would not cost more than $500. Paul moved that we accept this idea.
Elaine seconded, and the motion was approved by the members present.
Chris Podzemny came to talk about his recent find. He believes he found the burial of Sostenes l'Archevêque at
the confluence of Sierrita de la Cruze Creek and the Canadian River. He wants to see if the PAS could help him,
and to put up a historical marker up there.
The Flint Knapp in at Roaring Springs, Texas is January 24 – 25.
Alvin Lynn has been selected for the Curtis Tunnel Award from the Texas Historical Commission. This is the
highest award you can receive for an archaeologist.
Paul motioned to adjourn the meeting.
The meeting adjourned at 8:25 p.m.
Respectfully submitted,
Miranda Bible, Substitute Secretary

A Brief Review of Archaeological Work Conducted at Palo Duro Canyon State
Park

Dr. Veronica Arias
Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum
Abstract

Palo Duro Canyon has been an important place for human occupation within the Southern Plains for several millennia. There is archaeological evidence that
its unique topography, fauna, and flora were attractive to different cultural groups
throughout the past 12,000 years. This presentation will discuss the types of archaeological work conducted within Palo Duro Canyon State Park (PDCSP) since
its inception in 1933. It reviews some of the highlights of the recently co-authored
publication entitled History of Archeological Investigations at Palo Duro Canyon
State Park (available for download at https://jtah.org). This research examined the
various factors both within the discipline and in the broader arena of cultural resource management that have shaped both the amount and types of projects conducted at PDCSP over time. Finally, some of the preliminary findings of the 2019
Texas Archeological Society Field School held at PDCSP will be discussed. This
latest field school has been the most intense effort to date to better understand the
archaeology of the park and the rich history of human occupation in this region.
Biography
Veronica Arias has been involved in archeology and archeological projects
for over twenty years. Most of her past work has been in the American Southwest and the Pre-Columbian Andes, although she has focused on the archeology
of the Southern Plains since her arrival to West Texas A&M University in 2014.
She is currently the Curator of Anthropology and Natural History at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, adjunct assistant professor of anthropology at the
University of New Mexico, and the immediate past president of the Panhandle
Archeological Society.

2020 Perryton Stone Age Fair
Presented by

Courson Archaeological Research
10:00 AM to 5:00 PM April 25th, 2020
at
The Museum of the Plains
1200 N. Main
Perryton, Texas 79070

The Perryton Stone Age Fair provides artifact collectors with an opportunity to
showcase their prehistoric and historic Indian artifact collections. Equally important, the
event also provides a setting where collectors can meet with other collectors and exchange information. Persons with collections related to the pre-settlement era, specifically military or buffalo hunting, are also invited to attend. Individuals who are not interested in displaying artifacts they have found, but would like to learn more about them, are
also encouraged to bring them as archaeologists will be on hand to help with artifact
identification.
Buying, selling or trading of artifacts is not permitted at this event. Artifact reproductions may be displayed for educational purposes as long as they are labeled as such.
Exhibitor set-up is from 4:00-7:00 p.m. on Friday and from 8:00-10:00 a.m. on the
day of the show. The doors will open to the public at 10:00 a.m. and will close at 5:00
p.m. Admission is free and food and drinks will be available for purchase. Following the
fair exhibitors are invited to a free catered dinner and door prize give-way. To reserve
free table space or for additional information please contact Courson Archaeological Research at (806) 434-0157.

A WORD FROM YOUR PRESIDENT
As the president of the PAS, I am trying to help our society grow, and I believe that the best way to
do that is to do more public outreach and to get exposure where we can. That being said, I would like to
know what ideas you have and your ability to commit to them. For example, the Texas Master Naturalist:
Panhandle Chapter has held a booth for a day at the Amarillo Community Market, showing people how to
make bird-feeders out of plastic water bottles. Does that sound like a good idea? If so, would you be able
to help/volunteer with something like that (Amarillo Community Market is held on Saturdays in the summer), and do you have any ideas about the activities that we could do? Do you have ideas for events and
activities that we could do to attract public attention in Palo Duro Canyon? Or even Caprock Canyon if
we’re all willing to go that far? Or even events held at local libraries and other public institutions. Be
thinking about days of the week and times of the day that you would be most available and willing to participate in these activities. Please let me know of any ideas that you have! Feel free to build up on some of
the ideas mentioned here and/or let me know if you have any completely unique ideas of your own at the
next meeting! Either way, I’d love to hear what ideas you have! Please see the form on the next page.
Secondly, I would like to know what you would like to get out of the PAS. Would you like
to go on field trips? I can’t guarantee that we can get people to discuss these topics, but are there certain
topics about anthropology and archaeology that you would like to hear more about from our speakers? Or
are there topics that you would like to know more about that might inspire an activity for us to do as a society? Again, be thinking about days of the week and times of the day that you would be most available
and willing to do any activity that is proposed. Again, please let me know in the attached form on the next
page.
