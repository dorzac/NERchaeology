CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS IN DOWNTOWN BROWNSVILLE

ABSTRACT

The proposed Brownsville Multimodal Transportation facility is to be
constructed in downtown Brownsville in a two and a quarter block area.
Archival records and Sanborn Insurance maps indicated that residences
were once present within the study area, probably as early as the mid1800s. The 1894 Sanborn map covers most of the area and residences are
shown to be present. Subsequent maps indicate that residential structures
continued in use into the 1900s but the focus of this research was on the
discovery of pre-1875 structures. More recent commercial structures and
parking lots covered the area when this investigation began. The
architectural resources were described and evaluated before being
demolished. Monitoring removal of the concrete slabs resulted in the
location of several brick wall alignments, an unmapped brick-lined cistern,
and the base of the foundation of a residence that constructed in the early
1900s. Several bottles or bottle fragments and an 1891 centavo were
recovered from fill but are the only evidence of pre-1900 occupation. No
evidence of residences in the 1800s was found. Based on the findings, AR
Consultants recommends that construction can continue as planned
without the need of additional cultural resource investigations.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Brownsville/Brownsville Urban System (BUS) is in the process of
constructing a multimodal transportation terminal in downtown Brownsville, Texas. BUS
contracted with Carter & Burgess, Inc., now Jacobs Engineering, to prepare an
environmental assessment to provide a baseline for determining potential impacts that
might result from the construction of the terminal. The selected terminal site includes 4.6
acres located two blocks north of the Gateway International Bridge in the downtown
Central Business District of Brownsville (Figure 1). The tract is bounded by East
Jefferson Street on the north, International Boulevard on the east, East Adams on the
south, and East 13th Street on the west. This area includes all of Blocks 91, 92, as well as
Block, A which is a triangular block that is situated between Block 91 and International
Boulevard. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) as part of their statewide project
review process requested that the history of the area be compiled and then directed BUS
to have the standing architectural structures recorded by a qualified historic architect.
Then they requested that an archaeological investigation be carried out to determine if
evidence of earlier occupation, particularly during the late 1800s had been preserved.
This was done by monitoring removal of the building slabs and the parking lot which are
shown as Figure 2 below and on which the 1894 Sanborn has been superimposed.
The proposed multimodal terminal will serve as the new downtown transfer terminal for
BUS transit routes, as well as the central station for intercity bus lines that service the
Brownsville area. Other modes will include taxis, automobiles, and pedestrians. The
proposed facility will include the terminal building, bus bays, canopies, vehicle parking,
car and bus access, and pedestrian walkways.
The environmental setting of the terminal no longer has any native plants or animals but
the sediments underlying it are Holocene in age and are mapped as floodplain deposits of
silt and sand (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976) as emphasized by the presence of
abandoned river channel segments [resacas] shown on Figures 1 and 2. The Soil
Conservation Service mapped the entire area as being Rio Grande silt loam over which is
largely covered with urban development (Williams, Thompson, and Jacobs 1977:Sheet
84, pp.30). The soil has a thin light-gray silt loam Ap horizon overlying more than five
feet of silt clay C horizon.
The report continues with a brief review of the historic background. In the following
chapter titled “Potential of the Study Area”, we present a review of the recorded history
of the project area for the purpose of providing a foundation for evaluating the area’s
potential for the preservation of historic structures. Chapter 4 contains the results of
Roberto Ruiz’ documentation of the standing architectural structures within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE) that were present when the project began. Completed THC
Historic Resources Survey Forms are reproduced in Appendix A and the end of the
report. Chapters 5 and 6 present the findings of the monitoring of slab removal and
parking lot clearing. The final chapter presents a recommendation for project clearance.
A list of references concludes the report.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND, DOCUMENTARY
AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

The historic record for the city of Brownsville begins in 1848 after the end of the
Mexican-American War with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (Horgan 1984:779).
Charles Stillman, entrepreneur and impresario, and his associates created a colony almost
overnight and laid out an original town site of 308 squares of property (Brownsville
original town site subdivision, Map Records of Cameron County Volume 5, Page 3).
These were laid out using the Quartermaster’s Fence at Fort Brown as a baseline and as a
result were some 50 degrees west of true north. The area of the MMBT was originally
platted as Blocks 90, 91 and 92 and was directly adjacent to the Fort Brown Military
establishment. Thus, on the earliest maps, Brownsville appears as a major settlement
with 308 blocks and some 3696 individual lots (Brownsville original town site
subdivision Volume 5, Page 3) although almost the entire population was clustered at the
protected location beside the Quartermaster’s Fence.
Throughout the 1850’s, Brownsville’s growing pains were compounded as the put as the
community struggled to overcome the effect of bandit raids by the infamous Juan
Cortina, the filibustering tactics of General Carbajal in Mexico, and outbreak of yellow
fever in 1858. Expansionistic plans had to be shelved and the city actually decreased in
population and influence (Pierce 1917).
During the American Civil War the city’s fortunes rebounded because of it’s status as the
Confederacy’s entrepot and, after the arrival of Federal naval forces, a smugglers’
headquarters. Goods and cotton were transshipped across the Rio Grande, transported
overland, to Mexican facilities at the mouth of the river, and then transferred to European
ships (Pierce 1917). Although few records survive, it is obvious that the community
dabbled in the politics of two major wars on both sides of the border. After these
turbulent events, Brownsville emerged as an important point of contact between the
United States and Mexico and a river port. Until the arrival of the railroad in 1872, from
Port Isabel, all commerce depended on shipping material across the river bar and then by
steamer or wagon up the river to Brownsville and further inland.
During the latter decades of the 19th century Brownsville expanded outside the original
boundaries of Stillman’s original community and in blocks 90, 91, and 92 both domestic
and commercial structures were constructed. This is quite clear from the relevant
Sanborn Insurance Company maps and from city records.
By the early 1900’s the entire Rio Grande Valley had begun to develop into an
agricultural dynamo and Brownsville, far from being merely a sleepy border town,
continued to develop as the population and commercial center. It was, then, remains the
largest city on the United States side of the Texas/Mexico border.

POTENTIAL OF THE STUDY AREA
According to research conducted by Pollyanna Held (2008), there is archival evidence of
pre-1870s occupation within Blocks A5, A6, 91, and 92 but none of the existing
structures date to the period before 1900. In fact, most of the structures present within the
two blocks are less than fifty years old (Ruiz 2009). However, as Ruiz notes, several of
the residences in the surrounding blocks are early 1900 in age and notes that they are
presently on pier and beam foundations. In contrast, the Gothic Revival style Immaculate
Conception Cathedral and associated buildings is dated to 1860 and is built of brick and
appears to have been constructed at grade. Fort Brown was built by General Zachary
Taylor on the north side of the Rio Grande in 1846.
Cameron County was created after the 1848 signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
which settled the Mexican American War. In 1850, Charles Stillman, a local entrepreneur
formed the Brownsville Town Company and the town of Brownsville (Zavaleta 1995).
Held’s archival review indicates that virtually every lot in the three-block area was
owned either in the 1850s or 60s, but the information useful in dating structures does not
become specific until the appearance of Sanborn maps dated in the late 1800s.
The best coverage of the two-block study area is first provided on the 1894 Sanborn
Insurance map, which includes all of Block 92 and Lots 4-9 of Block 91 (Figure 3).
Dwellings are shown to be present on almost every lot with larger residences set back a
short distance from the edge of East Adams and smaller residences abutting or having
their porches abutting East Jefferson. Virtually all of the dwellings are single story and
many have a smaller single story building set back from the building a short distance or
attached to the primary dwelling. Dwellings are also facing onto East 13th and East 14th
Streets. Several lots have outbuildings that are labeled “TH.RP.” but we do not know the
meaning of this abbreviation.
Lots 5 and 6 in Block 91 are marked with “Mexican Shanties” but we are not certain if
this means that the structures shown are the reputed shanties or that shanties preceded the
then existing structures.
Previous archaeological investigations in the surrounding half-mile radius, indicates that
buried historic features could be encountered although no evidence of their presence is
visible on the ground surface or will be directly under the present ground surface.
Excavation at the site of Campo Santo Viejo (Keller 2004:17) indicated that 18 inches
(46 cm) of soil overlies the caskets. Thus, it would appear that in this nearby location no
soil has been brought in to raise the natural grade.
Little had changed in the study area between 1894 and 1906 (Figures 4 and 5).
Relatively major construction occurred in plots 8 (block 91) and 6 (block 92) with
removal of old structures and the building of new. More minor modifications are seen in
plots 5 and 6 (block 91), as well as to plots 5 and 3 (block 92).

41CF126 is a dome-topped cistern located 27 feet from the curb on the southwest side of
East Adams, 135 feet southeast of corner of East Adams and 11th street (TASA 2009).
The cistern appears on an 1885 Sanborn map, providing a clear terminus ante quem of
that year. The cistern about 9.5 feet wide with a depth of roughly 12.5 feet as measured
from the “brick paving” around the opening–presumably this was the original ground
surface. The feature is lined with low-fired bricks with dimensions of 8.5” in length, by
4.25” in width, by 2.5” to 2.375” in height. A second interior wall lines the cistern
beginning 9 feet below the original ground surface. Unlike the primary lining, this
second wall is of cast mortar containing brick fragments. A concrete slab covered the
cistern before being exposed by construction work. If a collar once existed around the
opening, it was removed before the pouring of the concrete slab.
The Greek Revival style Charles Stillman House (41CF94), constructed in 1850, is a pier
and beam structure with a brick façade and chimney. A brick well and a brick carriage
house still exist on the property. The Neale House (41CF95) is one of the two oldest
houses in Brownsville (ca. 1850). The house was moved to a location south of the United
States Customs House after it was given to the Brownsville Art League in 1950.
Campo Santo Viejo (41CF194) is the site of the original Brownsville cemetery
established in 1848. Excavation of the site by Southern Archaeological Consultants
confirmed 50 burials and grave shafts, though they speculated a total residency of 700 to
800 graves. Burials were recorded to about six feet below the surface of the once
covering parking lot, but some are as shallow as 46 cm below the surface.

ARCHITECTURAL RESOURCES WITHIN THE APE

A total of 44 standing structures were defined as being within the Area of Potential Effect
(APE) as agreed upon by the Texas Historical Commission and AR Consultants. This
final agreement highlights the need to agree upon the appropriate parameters for the APE
as early in a project so that all the participants in a project share in the same vision and
are able to implement it within a reasonable time frame for planning and construction.
Initial coordination between BUS and the THC began on November 22, 2004 and THC
responded to the contact letter asking for an accurate map of the entire project area and a
determination of the area of potential effect. Information about buildings or standing
structures within the APE and dating before 1956 was requested. BUS responded with a
reference to the 2000 Brownsville Historic Resources Survey but the THC requested
additional information about individual buildings since it was not in the 2000 Survey
report. BUS provided information that was included in the Draft Environmental
Assessment as itemized on December 21, 2005. In this letter, BUS clarified the definition
of the APE by indicating that the APE “…includes only the properties within the
proposed terminal site and the properties directly adjacent to the site.” This letter was
stamped “NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED PROJECT MAY PROCEED” by
the THC and signed for F. Lawerence Oaks, the State Historic Preservation Officer and
dated 1-20-06.
Subsequently, Ann Irwin an archaeologist with Carter & Burgess contacted THC
regarding archaeological resources (Irwin March 9, 2006). Mark Denton of the THC
responded that there was the potential of finding pre-1870’s archaeological deposits and
he requested additional information. The Federal Transit Administration ultimately made
a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the project and the historic research was
completed and delivered to the THC by letter of April 21, 2008. The report recommended
monitoring of earthmoving activities. However, subsequent correspondence between
THC and Carter & Burgess on March 3, 2009 redefined the APE as including all
structures 45 years or older and being in an APE bounded by Elizabeth Street northwest
to 12th Street, from 12th northeast to Madison Street, from Madison southeast to the
International Bridge Road, on International Bridge southwest to May, on May southeast
to Taylor Street, and Taylor southwest back to Elizabeth. This would have more than
doubled the number of existing structures that would have to have been evaluated by
expanding the study area from slightly less than 5 blocks to 13 blocks.
Further discussion with the THC, resulted in the return of the APE to the originally
agreed upon area which we have termed the facing APE. The structures described in this
chapter are all contained with the facing APE.

demolished and the concrete support slabs and/or pads had been removed. The
demolition process started September 30, 2009, was not completed until January 27th,
2010. It should be clearly understood that the areas under the slabs had already been
exposed to a considerable degree of disturbance prior to slab construction. There were no
surviving 19th century above ground structures present (Ruiz 2009) and precious little
remained of anything but scattered and, in most cases displaced, foundations and/or sill
wall remnants. Archaeologists monitored the demolition process but they did not control
it. Rather they provided guidance and conducted limited recording during pad removal.
For convenience, the slabs or pads were numbered sequentially by order of their removal.
Pad numbers and their correlation to the Blocks and plots provided by the Sanborn maps
and city records are listed below.
Pad 1 Block 92 plot 9 fronts Adams Street First Cash Pawn Store
Pad 2 Block 91 plot 7 fronts Adams Street abandoned storefronts
Pad 3 Block 91 plots 8 and 9 fronts Adams Street old Auto Central
Pad 4 Block 91 plots 4, 5, and 6 Hardware Store fronts Jefferson and 15th Streets
Pad 5 Block 91 plot 11 fronts Adams Street abandoned

Pad 7 Block 90 not on Sanborn maps between 15th and International fronts 15th Street
Pad 8 Block 91 plots 11 and 12 El Expreso Bus Station fronts 15th Street
Pad 9 Block 90 Casa de Cambio not on Sanborn maps between 15th and International

Pad removal is a pretty straightforward process but it involves a lot of heavy equipment
and considerable planning. The trackhoe is key to the whole procedure and while it is
hardy a precise instrument, a skilled operator develops a surprising touch that can provide
archaeologists with considerable information about deposits, features, and even sequence
of events. The slab must be cracked and fragmented before removal and this usually
accomplished by dropping a large ((900-pound) iron ball onto the slab surface (Figure 6).
Once the slab is cracked, the trackhoe excavates a trench adjacent to one of the periphery
or grade beams and then begins the actual removal. The machine generally starts at one
corner and moves laterally across the slab, while using the remaining slab floor as a base
and disposal stockpile (Figure 7). When the beams are large and massive, as most of
these were, the process produces a veritable moonscape of disturbed deposits and slab
fragments.

The slabs/pads were all constructed according the same general engineering
specifications but all ten varied according to how the engineers addressed these
specifications. Thus, all pads utilized a concrete pier and beam construction but some of
them utilized rebar, some post tension, and some only wire grid. In some cases, the piers
were emplaced only around the periphery of the structure but in others there were
massive internal piers located at every beam intersection. In like manner, the beams
varied in their basic dimensions but the grid formed by the beam intersections was never
more than 15 feet on a side. In some cases, pad construction did utilize existing
foundation remnants in an apparent attempt to “save” concrete but in all cases the
standard procedure was to remove the original topsoil or “A” soil horizon and some
portion of the subsoil “C” horizon before adding new fill. This fill might be spoil from
the surrounding area but in most cases “clean” sand or other material was imported from
elsewhere. In all cases, the fill was compacted before the beam slots and pier
emplacements were excavated through it and into the now buried “B” horizon. Without
exception, this excavation and filling process ensured that 19th century materials were at
least massively displaced but they were generally entirely removed before construction of
the slabs began. This left the archaeologists with little to do but observe and develop an
appreciation for slab construction.
Pad 1 covered virtually all of Lots 8 and 9 in Block 92 but while the Sanborn maps show
19th century buildings in this location, little remained of them beneath the slab. An
unoccupied one story commercial/retail building had been built on the site at an unknown

date and the structure had no historic designations (Ruiz 2009:Property Site No. 30). The
eclectic commercial style building had been demolished and removed from the property
before monitoring began. A 4.5’ wide trackhoe trench had been excavated outside the
south side of the slab approximately spanning the boundary between Lots 8 and 9. A
section of the concrete beam adjacent to the trench in the southwest of the corner had
been removed and a stepped brick “wall” just inside the beam (Figures 8 through 10) was
identified. The bricks are low-fired and have no identifying manufacturing marks
(Gurcke 1987). The wall had not been disturbed by the beam removal but appeared to
have been truncated to the north when a parallel beam had been installed as part of the
support for the overall slab. In fact, clearing of the slab continued to the north and it
became apparent that the slab was poured on top of a square pattern of concrete beams
that have an average spacing of fifteen feet (Figures 8 and 9). The beams are strengthened
with modern style rebar (Slaton, Gaudette, Hime, and Connolly 1995) and are connected
to the slab with the same style rebar. Based on the rebar, the structure is certainly no
more than fifty or sixty years old. The beams are 12 inches wide and extend
approximately 15 inches below the bottom of the slab and full thickness of the slab and
beam is 28 inches. They were formed in fill dirt trenches in which rebar boxes had been
placed and then the entire beam and slab were poured at one time. The beam trenches
appeared to have been excavated into silty loam containing an abundance of inclusions,
residential trash, and some construction materials.

The south corner of a brick foundation is made of soft commercial bricks that have no
manufacturer’s mark but which match standard commercial brick dimensions, ie,
8x4.5x2.5”. The southeastern wall extends 92” northeast and then turns at a ninety degree
angle and continues a short distance before it had been truncated (Figure 10). The
southwestern wall extends a short distance, and had been truncated. The southeastern
wall was roughly cleared and presented a stepped profile. The bottom of the foundation
was only one brick high but the interior was not exposed. A row of three stacked bricks
make up the second section of the foundation and are set back approximately midway
from the outer face of the lower brick. The third row is made of two stacked bricks,
which are also set back from the face of the second row. There is a forth row of bricks
that was at least one brick high and is also set back like the lower rows and is two bricks
thick. The southwestern wall and the northeastern wall appeared to present the same
stepped profile as the southeastern wall. A thin layer of disintegrating cement is between
the bricks.

Brick foundation is shown in relation to the concrete beam, which is just
to the left.

The four-foot wide trackhoe trench was extended from the brick foundation to the
northeast along the edge of the Lot 9 concrete slab (Figure 11). As elsewhere, the slab
was underlain by concrete beams. A profile of the trench wall was taken opposite the
foundation and it revealed 27” of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty loam containing
inclusions of domestic trash and building materials extending down from the present
ground surface. This upper layer rests on a 5” thick layer of very dark grayish brown
(10YR3/2) weathered silty clay containing root hairs, some artifacts, cut mammal bones
and is clearly vertisolic. This is probably a disturbed “A” horizon. Below this is a 14”
thick layer of black (10YR2/1) compact clay with slickensides. The bottom exposed layer
is at least 6” thick and is dark yellowish brown (10YR3/4) loose sandy clay that is less
stiff than the overlying black layer. This is probably a truncated “B” soil horizon. The
profile on the opposite wall adjacent to the foundation is similar but is missing the black
layer and the middle and lowest layer and appropriately thicker. It is possible that all the
layers are fill of various types but artifacts were not apparent in the black and lowest
layers. The soil profile compares relatively well with the Rio Grande Series of soils
(Williams, Thompson, and Jacobs 1977:29-30).
A 34’ long section of a single brick wide wall is just inside the estimated edge of Lot 10
(Figure 11). The bricks are of various colors and are soft commercial bricks that match
the foundation bricks exposed in Lot 9. There is barely any cement between the bricks
but they are laid end to end and are stacked 11 bricks high. They may represent a
property boundary wall or may have been placed to serve as an outer wall sheathing to a
residence. The wall is standing vertically but does not appear to have been well
constructed and is interpreted as a probable sill wall that was constructed around the
crawlspace of a raised pier and beam structure.

Pad 2 is a post tension slab at the corner of Adams and 14th Street. The actual slab in
this location is only 8 inches thick but the beams are approximately 20 inches wide and
nearly 30 inches deep. Thus, the total depth of the slab excavation is about 30 inches
below the original ground surface, which is apparently exposed below the sidewalk on
Adams. The “B” horizon is a 10YR2/1 silty clay with absolutely no organic or other
inclusions. The clean fill in this location is composed of a layer of 10YR7/6 sand that
rests on the “B” horizon. The fill is separated from the actual concrete by a clear plastic
liner. No evidence of earlier structures was detected under this slab.
Pad 3 is a wire and rebar slab some 14 inches thick with beams that measure
approximately 24 inches by 22 inches. Thus, the total depth of this foundation is about
36 inches and in places, the excavation has definitely reached into the “B” horizon. The
beams form a grid approximately 12 feet by 12 feet and there are piers at every
intersection. The piers on this slab are truly massive and measure nearly 3 feet on a side
and some 36 inches in depth. As a result, they were excavated through the fill and even
deeper into the “B”. The fill is separated from the concrete by a clear plastic film.
Despite this massive disturbance, some foundation remnants did survive, albeit in
fragmented condition. For example, on the southwestern side of the plot a foundation
remnant of soft yellowish brick some 26 inches thick and at least 7 bricks deep is a wall
almost 13 feet in length. There are two identical 45 degree turns off of this wall. One of
these continues to the north from the southwestern corner of the wall for 40 inches. At
the other end is another 45-degree angle turn with nearly 10 feet of wall remaining. This
peculiar footprint with an east/west base line and two 45-degree angle turns matches the
structure shown on the 1906 Sanborn Insurance map for plot 8 of Block 91. There can be
little doubt that this is a remnant of the same structure. A detailed sketch measured
drawing of this remnant was prepared but this particular portion of the foundation has
been truncated by beam construction and cannot be followed further. A portion of the
west wall of this structure and some probable cross walls are also present but all have
been cut by beam slots and pier construction. Apparently, these fragments survived
because those constructing the slab decided to save some concrete by using the lower
foundation remnants as supports. However, they still removed the material (i.e. “B”
horizon subsoil) from around the foundation remnants before adding fill and compacting.
As a result, nothing of archaeological interest survived except the very base of the
structure’s foundation and even that was badly damaged.
Pad 4 is located occupied most the northern half of Block 91 between at Jefferson Street
and the central alleyway. This was the two-story Brownsville Hardware store and it
required a massive foundation with lots of rebar support. The actual slab is 8-10 inches
thick and the beams are about 28 inches thick and nearly 30 inches deep and form a grid
that is only 12 feet on a side. The beams have been excavated into a compacted caliche
fill that is itself 12 to 15 inches thick. There is a clear profile under the sidewalk that
provides a good view of the slab construction details. Here a truncated “A” horizon
(10YR3/3 silty clay loam) at least 6 inches thick has been completely removed and the
exposed “B” horizon (10YR4/4 silty clay) has been cut into at least 4 inches and

removed. The excavation was then leveled and compacted before the caliche was added.
A black plastic liner is present between the caliche and the actual concrete slab.
The Sanborn map for this area shows this area as being occupied by “Mexican shanties.”
We are unsure exactly what kind of structures these are but the implication is that they
were impermanent and ill constructed. These structures were replaced by the Immaculate
Conception School, which occupies the area in the 1914 Sanborn Map. The school was a
relatively major structure, occupying well over half the block, which survived until
Hurricane Beulah in 1967 and its construction must have introduced its own kind of
disturbance prior to the emplacement of the hardware store slab. It seems unlikely that
anything of 19th century origin could have survived these two phases of construction,
especially if the previous structures were insubstantial.
Pad 5 was a small abandoned store located west of the El Expreso Bus Terminal. The
actual slab is about 8 inches thick and it is supported by a series beams around the
periphery. There is a single central beam that is 18 inches wide and about 2 feet deep.
All these beams are all dug into a compacted sand fill and lined with black plastic film
(Figure 12). The excavation for this slab seems to have been about 24 inches deep and
there are very scattered brick and brick fragments embedded in the truncated “B” horizon
(10YR4/4 silty clay). The evidence suggests that the area was bulldozed to a depth of
about 2 feet and then leveled and compacted before the sand fill was added.
Pad 6 supported the two stories Lopez Grocery and it also required a massive foundation
with lots of rebar. The slab itself is only 6 inches thick but the beams are easily 20 inches
wide and 24 inches thick. The piers are 5 feet 3 inches square and extend below the
beam intersections for another 1.5 feet. Thus, the total depth of the excavation is at least
42 inches. There are piers at every beam intersection and the beam grid is about 15 feet
on a side.
Evidence suggests that the excavation for the pad was then at least 42 inches deep and
that it was cut deeply into the exposed and truncated “B” horizon (10YR2/2 clay). The
compacted fill is basically a 10YR4/3 sand and it has no inclusions. In a least six
locations stacked brick features were emplaced within the compacted fill and the beam
slots were purposely cut through these features and lined with clear plastic before the
concrete was poured. This was apparently an attempt to provide additional stability or
perhaps save fill but it is very obvious that these brick piles are not related to any earlier
constructions.
Pad 7 is a small slab between International Boulevard and 15th Street. The slab is only 6
inches thick and the beams around the periphery are only 16 inches thick. There are no
cross beams but two central piers were built for additional support. These are about 15
inches in diameter and two feet deep. Evidence suggests, then, that excavation for the
slab was about 24 inches deep before fill was added and compacted. The fill is separated
from the concrete by the black plastic lining and does contain bricks, brick fragments,
and other items of a cultural nature.

Figure 14. Photograph of pad/slab 7 removal.
Pad 8 supported El Expreso Bus Station. This was a two-story brick facade structure that
was apparently built in the 1960’s. The slab itself is about 8 inches thick and the support
beams are about 20 inches wide and 24 inches deep. The piers are pretty massive and
measure 5 feet by 5 feet. In some places, they extend five feet below the base of the
beams. As a result, the bottom of the excavation for the piers is nearly 8 feet below the
surface. The beam slot grid is about 15 feet on a side but in some locations, the grid is
smaller and has been made to fit the slab. The slab and all the beam slots are lined with
black plastic. The underlying “B” horizon (10YR2/1 clay) is covered with 10YR3/2
compacted silt loam, which has many cultural inclusions including bricks, brick
fragments, and other construction debris. On top of this first fill is a further fill of
10YR5/3 clean sand that is at least 2 feet thick.
The Sanborn map does not show any structures within this part of Block 91 but the
trackhoe uncovered a lined brick cistern at a depth of 28” inches below the present
surface (Figure 15). This cistern is 103 inches (8 feet 7inches) in diameter and 12 feet
deep. This cistern had been capped with a sheet of 1-inch plywood that was cut to size
and supported by a loose scaffolding of treated 2x6 lumber. This construction was then
covered with clean fill and the slab and its support structure was constructed on the fill.
Based on the presence of bricks and brick fragments inside the cistern, we believe that the
top of the cistern was removed during clearing for the slab and subsequently covered.
The cistern is believed to have been a bell or beehive shaped structure similar to the one
recorded as 41CF126 near the corner of Adams and 11th Streets and west of the project
area. Like that, structure this cistern is lined with low-fired 8.5-inch yellowish bricks laid

in parallel courses starting at approximately 12.5 feet below the lip of the cistern. A
second interior lining is composed of cast mortar with the brick courses completely
embedded within the mortar. These courses are obviously laid in a purposeful manner
and all the bricks are complete, unlike the feature at 41CF126, where brick fragments
were utilized (Figure 16). Concrete and rebar chucks were removed from the water by the
trackhoe and then water was pumped out of the cistern (Figure 17). It was impossible to
remove all the water or the debris that had filtered into the inside of the cistern. No trash
was present in the cistern fill and based on the relative “fresh” appearance of the plywood
and the supporting structure it appeared that the plug was probably constructed after
World War II.

A trench was then excavated outside the wall to determine how the cistern had been
constructed. The trench shows in the foreground of Figure 18 before the concrete and
support framing boards along with the water were removed.

No other structures were detected below Pad 8. Given the massive disturbance in this
vicinity and the depth of the excavation, the lack of features is not surprising. We believe
that the cistern only survived because it was so large and buried so deeply. Removal
would have required a major effort by slab construction crews and they simply found it
more expedient to cover the void and pour the slab without further effort. Cost may also
have been a consideration since the volume of this cistern is approximately 5700 gallons
and nearly 9 cubic yards of concrete would have been required.
Pad 9 supported a Casa de Cambio between International Boulevard and 15th Street.
This is, in terms of area, a relatively small slab but it proved to be quite thick (i.e. 12
inches). The beams are 16 inches thick and over 26 inches deep and utilized massive
quantities of rebar in the construction. Most of the rebar is at least an inch in diameter.
The piers are equally massive and almost exactly 4 feet square. Black plastic separates
the slab and its supports from the compacted fill. The same construction technique used
elsewhere was employed here as well and the excavation is at least 30 inches deep. The
fill on which the slab rests is a clean 10YR7/6 sand that is free of any cultural inclusions.
There are no Sanborn maps for this area but it is unlikely that any previously constructed
structures could have survived the disturbance and none was noted.
Pad 10 was a small raised slab location between International Boulevard and 15th Street
and north of Pad 9. This slab was constructed on the surface but it was supported by a
series of 16 black plastic lined piers that measure 4feet by 4 feet and extend below the
surface for at least 26 inches. It is clear from the exposed profile that this slab was also
constructed by excavating into the subsoil or “B” horizon and then filling the excavated
area with compacted sand that does not contain cultural inclusions. No structural
remnants were noted.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
UNDER THE ASPHALT PARKING LOT

After removal of all the slabs/pads, the only area that had not been examined and exposed
was the asphalt parking lot that occupied the northern half of Block 92 (i.e. north of the
alleyway). We were uncertain whether or not this area had been subjected to the same
kind of preparation procedures that accompanied slab construction or whether the
relatively shallow imprint of the parking lot might have offered more benign preservation
conditions.
This area was sampled using a road grader and front-end loader to remove the asphalt and
caliche base (Figure 21). Thereafter, we used the grader to expose the underlying fill
and/or native soil. The asphalt was found to be 2 inches thick and the caliche extended
another nearly 10 inches below that. Once the caliche was cleared, the grader removed
material in sequential lifts or scrapes of approximately 3 to 5 inches. Eventually a graded
strip or exposure nearly 300 feet long and some 60 feet wide or 18,000 square feet, along
Jefferson Street from 14th Street to 13th Street was available for inspection. This strip
began some 10 feet south of the current curb and continued south almost to the alleyway.

In this situation, the majority of the structures shown in the various manifestations of the
Sanborn Insurance Maps should, if present, have been apparent. None of those structures
was, in fact, located. Instead, the grader encountered a thick layer of compacted fill over
15 inches thick that had been leveled and tightly compacted. The total depth of
disturbance extends, then, from the surface to at least two feet. The fill included clay and
silty clay loam soils as well as large quantities of cultural items including bricks, brick
fragments, animal bone, ceramics, glass, metal, plastic and even cloth. Some of these
materials, including plastic chip bags, aluminum pop-tops, and cloth fragments are of
modern origin. Given the fact that these items were well incorporated into the fill, we
believe that most of them are related to the preparation of parking lot in the late 1960’s.
As a result, some of the fill probably resulted from that preparation and may, in fact, have
been imported from off site but some it was obviously related to early lot clearing and
preparation.
The archaeological evidence for this disturbance is quite clear and includes both
stratigraphic evidence and the presence of the basal foundations from a post-1915
structure (Figure 22). Not only is this structure obviously larger than any of those
structures shown on the various permutations of the Sanborn maps of 1896, 1906, and
1914 but it also has a footprint that does not match any of the structures on those maps. It
is also a structure for which we have both documentary evidence and informant
interviews.

We know quite a bit about this structure, which was constructed in 1917 by Albert
Fernandez. Mr. Fernandez sold the property to Thomas and Lencha Champion in the late
1930’s. Tom Champion and, his sister, Martha Castillo lived in this house with their
parents until at least 1960 and they remember it quite clearly, with both considerable
detail and more than a little fondness. Mr. Champion lived in the house until at least
1969 and, in fact, rode out Hurricane Buehal in 1967 while residing there. Both siblings
remember a raised brick pier and beam supported one story building. The structure had a
large attic that was subsequently converted into living quarters. It was a frame structure
built on stucco covered brick walls that were at least 24 inches high. There were both
front and back porches and a semi-detached kitchen and lavatory (Figures 23-26).

Mr. Champion remembers that he had the opportunity to purchase the frame portion of
the house (i.e. above the raised foundation) in 1969. He did not do so because of the cost
and difficulty of moving such a large structure. Nevertheless, this circumstance clearly
demonstrates the nature of the structure and nature of the demolition sequence.
Only the very bottom course of foundation bricks survived the demolition and parking lot
construction. The archeological evidence indicates that the trenches for these bricks were
dug into the compacted fill because the bricks do not rest on undisturbed “native” soil but
rather within obvious fill deposits. These fill deposits are present throughout the exposed
area and clearly indicate that a considerable amount of demolition and disturbance took
place before the construction of the exposed foundations. Indeed both of the informants
remember only vacant lots stretching from their house to the Immaculate Conception
School on Block 91.

Assessment and Results
The investigations of subsurface conditions at the site of the Multimodal Terminal
indicate that all of the structures that existed on the site prior to 1900 have been
destroyed, displaced, truncated, or severely impacted by demolition or pre-construction
activities. We suspect that these activities occurred piecemeal in a series of phased
clearing and preparation episodes rather than all at once. Nevertheless, there can be little
doubt that the ultimate effect of the combined activities was either outright removal or, at
best, severe displacement. The 19th century structures were demolished, or perhaps, in
some cases, removed and the underlying deposits were then shifted, displaced, and/or
removed to prepare a stable level surface for construction.
At the very beginning of this project the construction manager, Hans Vanborrendam, told
us that each of the ten slabs would be constructed differently but that all of them would
produce the same results. He was precisely correct because the slabs were all slightly
different but they all relied on the same engineering principles and they all required the
same kind of preparation. Every project required a stable level base and each of them
produced this situation by excavation, filling, and compaction. In every case, the “A”
horizon was removed and in most cases, a significant portion of the “B” horizon was
removed as well. This produced the required level surface ready for the introduction of
fill. Some of this fill was probably procured from spoil materials stockpiled after
excavation for just this purpose. This type of fill was conspicuous not only from the
presence numerous cultural inclusions, bricks and brick fragments, ceramic fragments,
bottle glass, animal bone, and metal items, but also from the mottled appearance provided
by mixed deposits from “A” and “B” soil horizons. Nevertheless, significant quantities
of fill were also acquired from off site sources. The most obvious examples of these off
site materials were the clean, often water sorted, sands with no cultural inclusions that are
quite distinct from the silty clays and clay loams characteristic of the immediate site area.
These fills were then densely compacted and the beam slots, piers, and other supports
were excavated into and often through the fill before the slab and its supports were

81

poured. In some cases, foundation remnants (pads 1 and 3) or dry stacked bricks (pad 6)
were utilized to either “save” concrete or stiffen the fill but these activities did not
mitigate the disturbance in any significant fashion. Perhaps significantly the utilization
of foundation remnants almost always occurred on the corners or peripheries of the outer
support or grade beams where the beams could be poured around the remnants and, thus,
incorporated into the network of beams and piers. The stratigraphic evidence for this is
quite clear.
The sole exception to this massive disturbance regime is the cistern and even it was
severely truncated during the preparation process. As a result, its presence, in disturbed
condition, is essentially the exception that proves the rule. There can, we think, be no
other reasonable interpretation.
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant 19th century structures
and/or undisturbed cultural deposits were present at the Multimodal Terminal site and, if
present, to identify and record such features. We can now demonstrate, rather
conclusively, that no undisturbed 19th century components are present. Under these
highly disturbed conditions, the surviving remnants cannot be expected to provide much
in the way of additional cultural/historical data. Given these findings, the construction of
the Multimodal Terminal facility should not have a significant impact on historic
preservation. We suspect that similar conditions exist under much of downtown
Brownsville but this interpretation should not preclude the need for additional
investigations. Brownsville does provide an important, and in many ways, a unique
historical perspective and some of that may still survive outside the boundaries of the
terminal site.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Monitoring slab removal resulted in the location of remnants, usually sections of wall
bases, of twentieth century age structures made of unfaced low-fired bricks that probably
were made in Mexico. Only two features were found which provided information about
potentially significant structures. These features were a cistern made of brick and cement
as well as the base of a residence built in the early 1900s. The collar of the cistern was
not present and the opening of the cistern wall had been closed with a level layer of
plywood placed on top of a wooden interior framework. Sterile sand and then a thick
concrete slab for the bus station had been constructed over the plywood. The lowest layer
of foundation bricks is all that was found at the house, which apparently had had a twofoot high foundation on top of the remaining layer of bricks.
AR Consultants and Southern Archaeological Consultants have concluded that neither
structure retains the contextual integrity to be considered for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. Our final
recommendation is that this project proceed without the need of further cultural resource
investigations.
