The 2000 TAS Field School:
Archeological Investigations in the Alamito
Creek Basin, Presidio County, Texas
Richard W. Walter

ABSTRACT
The Texas Archeological Society 2000 field school was held in the Alamito Creek basin of the Marfa Plain in
Presidio County, Texas. Seven study areas (Areas A-G) were delineated for purposes of archeological survey,
and test excavations were conducted at selected sites. Findings concerning archeological sites recorded in areas
A-F, along with the results of site testing in areas C and F, are described and discussed. Survey results and largerscale field school excavations carried out along Perdiz Creek in Area G, as well as investigations at the historic
Davis-Herrera homesite on the Chihuahua Trail, have been reported previously by Cason (2005) and Wharton
(2007). Taken together, findings from the 2000 field school constitute virtually the first substantive, scientifically derived, archeological data set for the Marfa Plain, a major physiographic zone in the Texas Big Bend.

INTRODUCTION
In June of 2000, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) annual field school was held on the
MacGuire Ranch located in northeastern Presidio
County (Figure 1). The field school was held in
cooperation with the Center for Big Bend Studies (CBBS) and the Department of Behavioral
and Social Sciences at Sul Ross State University.
Long-time TAS members and CBBS archeologists
Robert Mallouf and Andy Cloud served as directors for the project. The ranch encompasses ca.
60,000 acres and is situated in the Marfa Plain, a
major physiographic feature of the Big Bend that
was poorly known archeologically prior to the field
school (Mallouf 2000:2, 2001a:14).
The ranch was divided into seven study areas
(Areas A-G) for the purpose of organization and fieldwork logistics (Figure 2). These areas consisted of:
• the high elevated grasslands and drainage
systems of the Marfa Plain (Areas A-E);

• the main stem of the Alamito Creek basin
(Area F);
• the basaltic Frenchman Hills and attendant
drainages such as Perdiz and Julia creeks
(Area G) (see Cason 2005); and

• the Chihuahua Trail roughly parallelling
Alamito Creek (Area F).
Crews were dispersed among each of these areas to conduct archeological survey investigations,
along with limited test excavations at chosen sites.
Also, the “Chihuahua Trail Crew” was assigned
to detect remnants of the Chihuahuan Trail within
Area F and to also investigate the 19th century
Davis-Herrera adobe home site, school, and chapel
located a few miles to the south of the project area
at Alamito (formally called Plata), Texas.
Results from a number of sites investigated
during the 2000 TAS field school have previously
been published. This includes Cason (2005) using
the survey and test excavation results in survey
Area G as comparative data to sites in an environmentally contrasting area in the Glass Mountains
of Brewster County, Texas; McClure (2001) for
faunal analysis from a test excavation at San Esteban rockshelter in Area F; Wharton (2002, 2007)
concerning the work of Fullen and Wharton’s TAS
crew at the historic Davis-Herrera home site that
became part of a preservation effort that included
the ceremonial placement of a Texas Historical
Marker on the site in May 2000 (Cloud 2001) and
the privately funded construction of a protective

n.d.) are currently nearing completion. This article

describes sites recorded and limited subsurface
testing done during the reconnaissance survey
in Areas A-F (excluding work conducted at San
Esteban Rockshelter), test excavations in Areas
C and F, and additional findings of the Chihuahua
Trail survey crew.
The field school attracted over 350 participants, and every attempt was made to maximize
data returns from across the extensive project
area. As is always the case, the TAS membership
provided a very capable and enthusiastic workforce, and their achievements during the project
are noteworthy. As a result of the field school, the
legendary Marfa Plain was for the first time added
to the growing number of eastern Trans-Pecos
physiographic zones that are yielding significant
new archeological data. Long a subject of interest to historians, the Marfa Plain was in contrast
marginalized by archeologists for many years. As
of 2000, this high grassland remained virtually
unknown archeologically. The 2000 field school
findings thus provide the first substantive archeological data set for the area, and a foundation for
future research.
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Physiography
The MacGuire Ranch is located in northeastern Presidio County, Texas (see Figure 1).
The 60,000 acre ranch is located on the Marfa
Plateau (often referred to as the Highland Country) within the Basin and Range physiographic
province and the Mexican central plateau of the
northeastern portion of the Chihuahuan Desert
(Blair 1950:105; Wells 1977:67). Elevation ranges
from ca. 4200 to 4700 ft. amsl. The project area is
drained by Alamito Creek and its laterals, including Mimbres, Julia, and Perdiz creeks, as well as
unnamed tributaries. Alamito Creek drains in a
general south-southeast direction, and the floodplain is sometimes over two miles wide. In the
project area this broad floodplain is bordered on
the west by basaltic uplands (Frenchmen Hills)
and on the east by a pronounced linear escarpment
that represents the terminus of an extensive ash
flow. Within the northern portion of the project
area are high-elevated grasslands with limited
topographic relief. Local springs either discharge
along bedding planes and fractures from extrusive

igneous units or from alluvial deposits within the
Alamito Creek basin (Brune 1981). Surface sediments can be characterized generally as silt loam
on fan pediments; clay loam on alluvial flats,
plains, and fan skirts; clay loam on drainage ways
and inset fans; gravelly clay loam to fine sandy
loam on erosional remnants; and very gravelly
loam on fan remnants and ballenas (USDS NRCS
2009).
Flora
The project area is in the Chihuahuan Desert
biotic province (Brown 1982). Vegetation within
the Marfa Plain can be generally classified as
desert grassland, although in some areas the encroachment of desert scrub has occurred. This is
primarily a result of the historic introduction of
livestock.
Desert scrub occurs primarily in marginal
grassland areas and along lower elevations, while
many species such as Catclaw Mimosa, Cane
Cholla, prickly pear, Honey Mesquite, Soaptree
Yucca, Spanish Dagger, and broomweeds occur at
varied elevations within the grassland community
(Powell 1998:7–8). The Alamito Creek drainage
supports some riparian vegetation that includes
Screwbean, Honey Mesquite, Rio Grande Cottonwood, and willows.
Fauna
The faunal diversity of the eastern TransPecos/Big Bend (ETP/BB) region is exceptionally
high (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Mammals that
occur in the region include black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, collared peccary, mule deer,
squirrels, gophers, mice, porcupines, mountain
lions, coyotes, bobcats, grey fox, kit fox, badgers,
raccoons, ringtail cats, striped skunks, spotted
skunks, and hog-nosed skunks, and 23 species of
bats (Schmidly 1977; Yancey 1997).
Birds common to the area are roadrunners, blue
quail, mourning dove, lesser nighthawks, northern
mockingbird, and a variety of raptors (Wauer
and Fleming 2002). Reptiles include whiptails,
western collared lizards, horned lizards, western
coachwhips, western diamondback rattlesnakes,
Trans-Pecos copperheads, Yellow Mud Turtles,
and Desert Box turtles (Wauer and Fleming 2002).
Amphibians include Leopard frogs and Spadefoot
Toads (Schmidt and Smith 1944).

Toolstone Resources
The ETP/BB region is rich in high quality
stone available in a number of settings that include but are not limited to: (1) secondary deposits
within alluvial fans and stream-load deposits that
contain a large variety of cryptocrystalline stones;
(2) exposed limestone beds containing chert and
novaculite; and (3) igneous uplifts that contain
felsite, rhyolite, chalcedony, and agate. It is worth
noting that some of this raw material macroscopically mimics stone from sources outside of the
region, such as Alibates agatized dolomite, Tecovas
Formation jasper, and a wide array of Edwards Unit
chert (Seebach 2011:5–6, 47, 271).
Along the western boundary of the project
area, the Frenchmen Hills consist primarily of
Petan Basalt, which is made up of trachyandesite
porphyry containing an abundant amount of whitecolored chalcedony; this is the result of late stage
remobilization of free silica that has subsequently
recrystallized in gas cavities (Cook 1970:14-15,
22). It was a major source of chalcedony used in
the production of chipped stone tools (Figure 3).

The Frenchmen Hills overlie and are bound on the
east by the Tascotal Formation, with upper and
lower layers. The upper layer consists of sandstone,
tuffaceous sandstone, and conglomerate containing
pebble to cobble-size limestone, igneous rocks,
chert, tuff, and sandy tuff. The lower layer consists
of tuff and tuffaceous fine-grained sandstone.
The Tascotal Formation is bordered on the east
by old Quaternary alluvium that contain some chert
and quartzite. The Alamito Creek stream load deposits consist of cryptocrystalline material suitable
for stone tool manufacturing (Barnes 1979). Areas
adjacent to and northeast of San Esteban Lake lie
within the Perdiz Conglomerate Unit and include
conglomeritic sandstone composed of clasts of a wide
variety of both volcanic and Cretaceous rocks (King
and Beikman 1978). Raw material types of the Perdiz
Conglomerate that are suitable for the production of
stone tools include basalt, banded rhyolite, rhyolitic
welded tuff, riebeckite rhyolite, chert, chalcedony,
and agate (Mallouf 1993; Ing et al. 1996). Outcropping east of the Perdiz Conglomerate Unit is Mitchell
Mesa Welded Tuff, the result of a massive, cliffforming, single ash flow (Barnes 1979).

Paleoenvironments
Paleoenvironmental data within the region are
mostly based on studies of packrat middens found
at Maravillas Canyon and Rio Grande Village in
the Big Bend. Grasses that were present during the
late Wisconsin period (11,000-22,000 years ago)
are relatively common in woodland assemblages,
some of which indicate a southern expansion of
typical Great Plains species such as Little bluestem
and Big bluestem. Other Big Bend grass species
identified during this time such as Black grama,
Sand dropseed, and Sideoats grama have been
documented as serving as sources of seed grains,
hair brushes, and brooms for prehistoric groups
(Van Devender 1995:80–84 and Table 3.1; Abbott
et al. 1996:Table 3). Between 11,500 and 10,500
B.P., trees and shrubs included papershell piñon,
juniper, hinkley oak, and sotol. The climate during
this time consisted of mild winters, substantially
cooler summers, and higher annual precipitation
that primarily fell during the winter months (Van
Devender 1986, 1990). By 10,300 B.P., the hinkley
oak declined dramatically and shrub oak increased.
Papershell piñon disappeared altogether while junipers persisted for another thousand years. Between
8,000 and 4,000 B.P., the regional vegetation transitioned from a xeric woodland into a desert/scrub
community (Van Devender 1990).
HISTORY OF INVESTIGATIONS
One of the first archeological sites noted in
the ETP/BB region was San Esteban rockshelter.
Peabody (1909:202-216) provided a brief written
description of some of the rock art there. E. B.
Sayles (1920) visited San Esteban shelter. Confusingly, the misinterpretation of Sayles’ field notes
led to the assignment of three additional trinomials (41PS99, 41PS100, and 41PS101), but these
trinomials were later retired in 1995 (Johnathan
H. Jarvis, personal communication, 2014). A. T.
Jackson (1938) recorded San Esteban rockshelter
and designated it as “Site No. 31,” and in 1939
Forest Kirkland meticulously copied the rock imagery at San Esteban using watercolors (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967:127-129). However, James E.
Corbin (1960) was the first to officially record San
Esteban rockshelter on a State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form, providing supplementary
photographs and drawings of the rock imagery.
San Esteban rockshelter was at that time assigned

the state trinomial of 41PS20. Miriam Lowrance
(1988:98-104) further recorded the rock imagery at
San Esteban in 1967 and 1968. In 1999, Bob Hext,
then the Chairman of the Art Department at Sul
Ross State University (SRSU), carried out a rock
art recording field school at San Esteban Shelter.
That same year, Robert Mallouf instrument mapped
San Esteban Shelter with the help of students from
his SRSU anthropology class (Robert Mallouf,
personal communication, 2013). During the 2000
TAS field school, rock art recording and test excavations were conducted at San Esteban shelter.
Another site, 41PS103, is located directly north
of San Esteban rock shelter (Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas 1999b).
In the early 1920s, V. J. Smith visited “San
Estaban Bluff,” a rockshelter designated as his
Location #74; and “San Eustaven Rock Shelter
Group,” an area of 50+ rockshelters below the bluff
and dam designated as Location #75. He collected
ground stone tools and scraper fragments at the
shelter and a square mano at the rock shelter group
site (Smith 1927). In the 1930s, several other sites
within the study area were visited by Sayles (1935).
Three of these sites are clustered together in a
small, dry side canyon that joins another unnamed
canyon draining into San Esteban Spring. Two
of these sites are small rockshelters (41PS92 and
41PS93) close to tinajas within the bedrock drainage. The other site, 41PS94, is cursorily described
and reportedly consists of several bedrock mortar
holes that are next to the aforementioned tinajas.
Three other sites, 41PS95, 41PS96, and 41PS97,
are tightly clustered on the southwest side of the
canyon that drains directly into San Esteban spring.
All are described as small rockshelters, one with
an associated lithic procurement area, and the other
two with associated refuse middens. 41PS97 was
noted to contain black on white pottery. Two other
sites, 41PS98 and 41PS102, are located within an
archeologically complex area that was assigned the
trinomial 41PS818 by the 2000 TAS field school
survey team. Sayles (1932) described 41PS98 as
a small rock shelter with an associated midden
deposit along with numerous small rock shelters
in the immediate vicinity. Sayles also noted that
many of these rockshelters were used by Mexican
laborers on an irrigation project nearby and that
entrances to some of the shelters were walled-in
by well-laid stone masonry.
In 1938, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University and Sul

Walter—Archeological Investigations in the Alamito Creek Basin, Presidio County, Texas

Ross State College joined forces to investigate the
association of cultural deposits with geological
deposits. Drs. Kirk Bryan and Claude Albritton
made up the geologic team working with Sul
Ross staff archeologists J. Charles Kelley and T.
N. Campbell. This interdisciplinary research approach was well ahead of its time and was one of
the first geoarcheological investigations conducted
in the United States. The investigations established
a basic stratigraphic sequence for the Big Bend,
and moreover, established the stratigraphic dating
of buried cultural deposits relative to regional alluvial deposits. The resulting cultural units were
defined as the Pecos River, Chisos, and Livermore
foci (roughly correlated with the Middle Archaic,
Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods) in
general association with the Neville, Calamity, and
Kokernot alluvial units, respectively (Albritton and
Bryan 1939; Kelley et al. 1940).
Other pioneering investigations occurred at
two sites within the Alamito Creek drainage. Located ca. 35 km south of the study area is the Shiner
site (41PS26), a buried multi-component site where
two pit houses with interior unlined hearths, ceramics, chipped stone tools, and projectile points
were recognized in association with the Calamity
and Kokernot alluvial formations. Another site, the
Williams site (41PS53), is located near the tiny village of Casas Piedras. A human burial and portions
of an indeterminate-type black on white pottery
vessel were discovered while cutting a new diversion ditch. The irrigation ditch exposed a profile
of the Kokernot formation overlying the Calamity
formation—cultural material and features were all
associated with the uppermost Kokernot formation
(Kelley et al. 1940).
Following a long period of sporadic arche­
ological investigations in the ETP/BB region, the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
in 1992 initiated a volunteer program coined
as “Texas Adventures.” The program included
research in the Alamito Creek basin and was
led by scientists of various disciplines under
the jurisdiction of the TPWD. This included
archeological reconnaissance of state-owned tracts
of the Cienega Mountains, portions of which are
now part of the northern panhandle section of
Big Bend Ranch State Park. The study area was
divided into seven segments, including one in
which Alamito Creek enters a small canyon system.
Some 24 archeological sites were recorded along
the stream course, often on elevated silt terraces

7

next to the confluences of arroyo systems and in
canyon shelters along Alamito Creek. Findings of
the reconnaissance along Alamito Creek included
buried Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic deposits
on silt terraces and a number of rockshelters. The
Bravo Bluff site (41PS567) was one of the more
important sites found along Alamito Creek. This
tuff shelter contained not only buried and stratified
cultural deposits, but a wide variety of pictographs
and petroglyphs. Based on a combination of
projectile point types and rock imagery, the site
was intermittently occupied from Late Archaic
through Historic times (Mallouf 1993).
Further studies and investigations have been
conducted since the 2000 TAS field school. These
include Cason’s (2005) comparative landscape
study of feature distributions within different environmental contexts, accomplished by comparing
the findings of the 2000 TAS field school survey
and test excavations along Perdiz Creek (Area G)
with findings from survey and test excavations at
Gilliland Canyon in the Glass Mountains, some
69 km east-northeast of the Area G study area. In
2002, Robert Mallouf collaborated with Bill Hubbard, landowner of the property that contains San
Esteban shelter, for its designation as a Texas State
Archeological Landmark (Mallouf 2002).
In 2008 and 2009, CBBS archeologists conducted subsurface investigations at the David
Williams site (41PS1020), an Early Archaic buried
open campsite located along Alamito Creek and
within Area F of the 2000 TAS field school (Boren
2010). In 2011, a linear survey was conducted by
Atkins International Engineering Company for the
Gonzales Transmission Line that transects Area A
of the 2000 TAS field school (Rowe 2011). One
of the more significant sites, 41PS1142, is located
just outside the Marfa city limits. The site is a
historic cemetery and associated artifact scatter
that contains four mechanically-disturbed Mexican
cairn burials with headstones dated between 1896
and 1900. Hundreds of glass, ceramic, and metal
artifacts were present that date as late as the early
1920s. Another site, 41PS144, is an early 20th century historic dump associated with Fort D. A. Russel. Two other sites, 41PS143 and 41PS145, were
considered prehistoric artifact scatters although the
latter site contained a possible hearth.
A brief reconnaissance in August 2006 of the
headwaters of Long Draw, a western tributary of
Alamito Creek, resulted in the preliminary recording of 24 prehistoric sites. Of note was a high

8

Texas Archeological Society

incidence of Middle and Late Archaic occupations
and a contrasting paucity of evidence for Late
Prehistoric use (Mallouf n.d.b). The confluence of
Long Draw with Alamito Creek lies within Area F
of the field school project.
In summary, very few cultural resource
surveys have been conducted within the Marfa
Plateau and highlands proper. In 1991, two previously unknown prehistoric lithic reduction sites
(41JD143 and 41JD144) were recorded just below
the eastern flanks of the Sierra Vieja and near the
mouth of Vieja Pass (Winchell 1992). In 1999,
Texas Department of Transportation archeologists
surveyed a segment of the right-of-way on U.S.
Highway 90. The remnant of a historic masonry
structure (41JD178) was noted along with a possible pre-1920 artifact scatter containing glass
artifacts.
CULTURE HISTORY
The culture history of the ETP/BB region remains poorly defined as compared to most other
regions in Texas. While various datasets that are
vital to understanding the variability and adaptations of prehistoric lifeways through time are
lacking, efforts to correct such deficiencies are
well underway. The chronological framework in
the ETP-BB region is divided into six periods:
Paleoindian (13,500–8,500 B.P. or 11,500–6,500
B.C.), Archaic (6,500 B.C.–A.D. 700), Transitional Late Archaic (ca. 2,950–1,250 B.P. or
1000 B.C.–A.D. 700), Late Prehistoric (A.D.
700–1535) (which includes the Livermore Phase
[A.D. 750-1200], the La Junta Phase [A.D. 12001400], and the Cielo Complex [A.D. 1330-1680]),
Protohistoric (A.D. 1535–1700) (which includes
the Concepción Phase [A.D. 1535–1693]), and
the Historic period (A.D. 1700–1950) which
includes the Spanish Colonial Sub-Period (A.D.
1700-1821), the Conchos Phase (1683-1760), the
Alamito Phase (A.D. 1700-1845), the Mexican
Sub-Period (A.D. 1821-1835), the Republic of
Texas Sub-Period (A.D. 1836-1845), the Texas
Statehood Sub-Period (Post-1845), and the Presidio Phase (Post-1850). A review of these periods
is beyond the scope of this article; however, summaries of each can be found elsewhere (see Kelley
et al. 1940; Mallouf 1985, 1999, 2005; Thompson
1985; Ing and Savage 1996; Alex 1999; Cloud
2004; Seebach 2004; Keller et al. n.d.).

OBJECTIVES AND
METHODOLOGY
The primary objective of the 2000 TAS field
school was to gather base-line data from prehistoric
and historic sites within a physiographic zone not
previously subjected to archeological investigation: the Marfa Plain and associated Alamito Creek
basin. This was accomplished by conducting a
reconnaissance-level survey of the project area
and test excavations at selected sites (Mallouf and
Cloud 2000). The reconnaissance was employed to
maximize the recovery of archeological data across
large areas, targeted to specific landforms:
• terraces and floodplains along the main stem
of tributary drainages;
• the junctures of valleys and valley walls;
• rock shelters or caves;

• elevated landforms within the basin;
• cut bank exposures;

• flat or level benches along sloping portions
of the landscape; and
• high settings overlooking the basin.

Prehistoric sites were designated under the
criterion that they contained one or more of the
following:
• burned or fire-cracked rock;
• features;

• buried cultural deposits; and

• over 15 pieces of debitage and/or several
functionally and/or temporally-diagnostic
tools.
Meager surface scatters of lithic material
and/or less than three tools and buried faunal
materials exposed in cut banks were considered
isolated finds (Mallouf and Cloud 2000). Newly
discovered sites were recorded by completing
a State of Texas Data Form. Sites were plotted
on a photocopy of the appropriate 7.5' USGS
quadrangle map. Sketches of site maps, features,
and rock shelters were also completed for each
site. Features were assigned sequential numbers
for each site. Photographs were taken of site
overviews, features, and artifacts. Temporally

Walter—Archeological Investigations in the Alamito Creek Basin, Presidio County, Texas

diagnostic artifacts and unusual specimens were
plotted, collected, and assigned artifact numbers.
Collected artifacts were bagged and appropriately
labeled (Mallouf and Cloud 2000).
Subsurface excavations were conducted at
varying levels of intensity. This included the
cleaning of arroyo cut banks and shovel tests to
determine the presence of buried cultural deposits
as well as the excavation of one or more 1 x 1 m
test units at selected sites that warranted further
investigations. Shovel testing was conducted at
sites with poor surface visibility and where the
depositional environment warranted the need to
determine the presence/absence and depth of archeological deposits (Mallouf and Cloud 2000).
Sites selected for testing were chosen in large
part prior to the field school. The intent of these test
excavations was to determine the nature, depth, and
integrity of the cultural deposits. Test excavations
were set up on a north/south grid system in 1 x 1
m and/or 1 x 2 m units. An elevation datum was
placed within or adjacent to a site to allow vertical control within excavation units. Test units were
excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels. All units were
excavated completely through the cultural deposit
and into the underlying sterile deposit. In situ artifacts were recorded relative to the unit and level
through triangulation, and photographs were taken
prior to removal. All artifactual materials and special
samples were bagged and labeled as to unit, level,
and specific elevation relative to the arbitrary datum.
In situ artifacts were assigned a provenience with
numerical designation on the excavation level floor
plan. Charcoal was recovered with a trowel or tweezers and placed in an aluminum bag. Samples were
labeled as to provenience and an assigned number
entered into a sample log. Bags were labeled with the
appropriate information such as name and field number of the site, test unit and level designation, name
of excavator, and date of excavation. Remaining
feature matrix or sediment excavated from arbitrary
levels at test units was screened through 1/8-inch
mesh hardware. Features were mapped using triangulation procedures. Excavation of features involved
the placement of units in such a way as to bisect the
feature. Roughly one half of the feature would be
excavated and a wall would be retained along the
bisectional cut for profiling purposes. The feature
excavation was treated as one unit instead of using
arbitrary 10 cm levels (Mallouf and Cloud 2000).
After being transferred to the TAS field laboratory, all stone and ceramic artifacts were cleaned

9

with brushes and well water. Fresh water mussel
shell fragments were left as is since most were
unstable and easily prone to flaking when cleaned
with water and a soft brush. Metal artifacts were
not washed with water, but merely dry-brushed as
needed. After cleaning, artifacts were cataloged
and enumerated with a lot number consisting of
the site trinomial, and provenience (i.e., unit and
level), and placed into polyethylene zip-lock bags.
Botanical remains were left alone and simply
housed in vials. Sediment samples were stored
in boxes on open shelving in strong polyethylene
bags. Digital images were stored on curation-approved media, and placed in appropriate protective
sleeves. All field notes and forms were copied onto
acid-free paper. All materials collected and archival
data generated will be held eventually at the Museum of the Big Bend, Sul Ross State University,
Alpine, Texas.
RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
As mentioned earlier, the reconnaissance survey of the high-elevated grasslands and drainage
systems of the Marfa Plain entailed seven study
areas (Areas A-G) and the discovery of 31 sites.
Findings within Area G were previously reported
by Cason (2005) and will not be repeated here.
Findings from Areas A–F are presented below.
Area A
Area A is within the northeasternmost portion of
the MacGuire Ranch close to the Marfa city limits.
The area is flat to gently rolling plains, alluvial flats,
and fan outskirts surrounding the Alamito creek
drainage. Vegetation along Alamito Creek is far less
dense within Area A compared to the more robust
riparian zone downstream in Area F. The survey
crew targeted areas adjacent to and on either side
of Alamito Creek and along the more prominent
landforms. Two prehistoric open campsites, one
prehistoric artifact scatter, and one multi-component
(Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric and historic) site
were discovered (Table 1).

thought to be resting on a Pleistocene-age surface.
The site contains a diffuse scatter of debitage (including cores and tested cobbles), chipped stone
tools, and a ground stone tool, including unifacial
and bifacial scrapers, multi-pointed gravers, indeterminate-type biface fragments, and a single mano
fragment. No cultural features were observed.
Because no temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered, the site is of unknown prehistoric
cultural affiliation.
Sediment within the site area is typically a
silt loam from the modern ground surface down
to just over 50 cm bs (USDA 2009). Because of
the nature of the depositional environment, two
shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 30 cm bs
that produced negative results. Profiles indicated a
gravel pavement overlying ca. 10 cm of gravelly
fine sandy loam, in turn overlying 20 cm of calcareous fine sandy loam.
41PS807
41PS807 is a 40 x 50 m historic special-use
campsite. The site is situated on an alluvial terrace adjacent to and east of Alamito Creek. Features consist of a large concentration of charcoal
void of rocks, a small rock cairn, and an historic
artifact scatter. The large concentration of charcoal is apparently a hearth feature; the exact
function of the cairn is unknown. Artifacts were

11

undoubtedly related to the long-term military
presence at Marfa. A concentration of horseshoes, horse shoe nails, and .45 cal. cartridge
casings were encountered on the east side of the
site. Also, two sanitary cans were observed. Two
cartridge casings were collected: one, a .45 cal.
cartridge casing with a military head stamp that
indicates that the cartridge was manufactured
by United States Cartridge Co., Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1917 (International Ammunition
Association 2009); the other is a .30-06 cartridge
casing with a military head stamp that was manufactured by the Union Metallic Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut, in November 1905 (Steinhauer
2002). Interestingly, this cartridge was fired without discharge and was later perforated in order to
empty out the gunpowder for disarmament. Also,
two slide components for a Colt single-action,
semi-automatic, .45 cal. M1911 pistol (Wikipedia 2009) were discovered (Figure 4). One slide
indicated a manufacture date of August 1929.
Other military artifacts included insignia for shirt
collars (Steffen 1979:63 and Figure 42) and other
equipment (Figure 5).
In addition, a complete formal biface was collected (Figure 6). The biface has convex lateral
margins toward the proximal end and is alternatively beveled at the distal end and measures 46.2
mm in length, 23.9 mm in width, and is 6.5 mm
thick. This biface is typical of those found at Cielo

complex and other Late Prehistoric campsites in
the ETP/BB region. The knife is made of a grayishbrown, fine-grained, opaque chert with fine seams
in the material. The material is vitreous with areas
of a pink hue suggesting that the material was
heat-treated.
41PS807 likely represents a short-term
military encampment or special use site, after
the post leased land from several ranches to use
as maneuver grounds in the early 1920s and
after the post was named Fort D. A. Russell in
1929. Based solely on the beveled knife, the site
contains a Late Prehistoric component. It is not
known if the two-beveled knife is associated
with the aforementioned cairn or is simply an
isolated find.
41PS808
41PS808 is a buried prehistoric campsite. A
side-notched arrow point (Figure 7) was discovered
partially exposed ca. 30 cm bs along the eastern cut
bank of Alamito Creek. Also, a buried soil horizon

13

was observed ca. 1 m below a cumulic A horizon.
Gravelly sandy loam to sandy loam was observed
below the soil horizon to a depth of ca. 2.6 m bs,
and several pieces of fire-cracked rock (FCR) were
noted within this stratum. Possible tested cobbles
and debitage were noted within a lower stratum that
consisted of gravelly (cobble-size) sand. The presence of the arrow point indicates a Late Prehistoric
component. Cultural material observed in two lower
strata as well indicate that older components may
be present.
41PS809
41PS809 is a small, 12 x 16 m, prehistoric
open campsite situated on a small point between
Alamito Creek to the east and an arroyo to the
west. Four hearths, a diffuse scatter of debitage,
and bifacial preforms were noted. Some of the
hearths were partially buried and appeared intact.
Although no temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered, the intact features have the potential
to provide chronometric and botanical data.

41PS810
41PS810 is a 40 x 80 m prehistoric artifact scatter. The site is situated adjacent to and east of Alamito
creek on an alluvial terrace and is ca. 100 m south
of the confluence of Four Mile Draw and Alamito
Creek. Debitage, a tested cobble, early stage bifaces,
a scraper, and a mano were scattered across the site.
No thermal features were observed. Field notes did
not mention any signs of buried deposits.
Isolated Finds
Locality A-3 was revisited on July 23, 2009
by CBBS archeologists to determine if there were
any cultural remains associated with a single bone
that was found eroding out of the eastern cut bank
of Alamito Creek. The bone was discovered within
a weakly developed soil exposed along the cut
bank. Upon inspection, no cultural material was
observed with the exception of a single vitreous,
historic whiteware sherd located ca. 5.0 m away
from where the bone fragment was discovered.
The bone fragment was examined by a faunal
specialist and appeared to be an ilium fragment
of a modern bison. Substantial calcium carbonate
mineralization and manganese staining of the bone
suggested that the bone was of significant antiquity
(Sarah Willett, personal communication, 2009).
The presence of one bison ilium fragment and one
whiteware fragment did not warrant site designation. Nevertheless, the presence of bison bone in
the eastern Trans-Pecos is extremely rare.
Area B
Area B is within a highland setting (see Figure 2) that contains fan piedmonts, alluvial flats,
plains, fan skirts, inset fans, and fan and erosional
remnants. Segments of two ephemeral drainages,
Long Draw and Chambers Draw, transect Area
B in a northeast/southwest direction. The survey
crew reconnoitered targeted areas on either side
of Nopal Road, which truncates Area B in a north/
south direction. Two prehistoric open campsites
were recorded (Table 2).
41PS811
Site 41PS811 is a 50 x 150 m prehistoric open
campsite situated on a flat sandy terrace south/
southeast and adjacent to the upper reaches of

Chambers Draw. The site has two small thermal
features (hearths) and a diffuse scatter of debitage,
chipped stone tools, and ground stone. No dateable
deposits were observed in either of the hearths.
The chipped stone assemblage consists of debitage,
unifacial retouched flakes, indeterminate-type biface
fragments, and projectile points. Raw material types
represented at the site were blue-gray chert, rhyolite,
and chalcedony. The ground stone assemblage consists of an expedient metate and one formal metate.
Three recovered dart points of the Pandale, Langtry,
and Palmillas types indicate that the site was repeatedly occupied throughout the entire Archaic period
(Figure 8) (Turner et al. 2011:128, 145-146).
41PS812
Site 41PS812 is a 100 x 100 m open campsite
located on a grassy flat ca. 200 m southeast of
Long Draw. The site contains a diffuse and light
scatter of FCR, debitage, chipped stone tools, and
ground stone. Although no discrete features were
encountered, there were areas with higher concentrations of FCR. Chipped stone tools consisted of
expediently retouched unifaces and two early stage
bifaces. The one ground stone tool was a mano.
The site is of an unknown prehistoric affiliation.
Area C
Area C is located south of the southeastern and
southwestern corners of Areas A and B, respectively (see Figure 2). The area includes the uplands
and lowlands on either side of the lower reaches of
Chambers Draw and an approximate 4 km swath on
either side of Antelope Draw. The area has alluvial
flats, plains, fan skirts, ephemeral drainages, inset
fans, erosional remnants and mesas, fan remnants,
and ballenas. Seven sites were discovered, six of
which are clustered within a ca. 500 x 500 m area
near Antelope Draw (Table 3). The remaining site
was discovered along Chambers Draw.
41PS813
Site 41PS813 is a 50 x 70 m prehistoric open
campsite situated on a sandy alluvial flat ca. 130
m north of Antelope Draw. A single deflated and
surficial thermal feature was discovered along the
eastern side of the site. The artifact assemblage
consists of a diffuse scatter of FCR, debitage, and
chipped stone tools; much of the debitage was

retouched and/or utilized. One Palmillas type dart
point was discovered that is indicative of Middle to
Late Archaic occupations (Turner et al. 2011:145).
41PS814
Site 41PS814 is a 50 x 70 m prehistoric open
campsite located ca. 100 south of 41PS813 and
only ca. 30 m north of Antelope Draw. The site
contains a deflated hearth and a diffuse scatter of
FCR, debitage, and ground stone. The ground stone
assemblage includes one metate and one mano, both
with only slight usage. The results of two shovel
tests indicated the presence of buried cultural materials (debitage and FCR). The debitage assemblage
(n=18) includes six hard hammer flake fragments,
four indeterminate-type flake fragments, one soft
hammer flake, and seven pieces of shatter. Raw
material is dominated by chalcedony (n=16). Other
material types are rhyolite and hornfels. A profile
drawing of one of the shovel tests (ST-2) indicates
ca. 5 cm of recent unconsolidated sand overlying
ca. 20 cm of unconsolidated sand intermixed with
pebble-sized gravels that in turn overlies ca. 20 cm

of compact sandy clay loam. No carbon remains or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
41PS815
Site 41PS815 is a 50 x 70 m prehistoric open
campsite of unknown age that is adjacent to and
south of an unnamed ephemeral drainage associated with Antelope Draw. Low-lying coppice
dunes and inter-dune areas are present. A heavy
concentration of artifacts is exposed on the surface within a ca. 20 x 20 m area. The remaining
area contains a light and diffuse scatter of artifacts. The site contains FCR, debitage, ground
stone (informal metates and manos), and a single
scraper. Three of six shovel tests revealed buried
cultural deposits, including what appeares to be
a buried thermal feature (see Results of Excavations, below).
41PS816

is situated on a sandy flat that contains small,
localized areas of low-lying coppice dunes.
Antelope Draw is ca. 300 m to the south. An
ephemeral drainage joins with Alamito Creek ca.
100 m west of the site. A mechanically excavated
drainage adjacent to a berm is located along the
western and northern margins of the site. Also, a
fence line, access road, and the Atchison Topeka
and Santa Fe railroad run parallel to each other and
are located adjacent and north of the site.
A small number of hearths, bifaces, projectile
points, manos, metates, and occasional pieces of
FCR and debitage were scattered across most of
the site area. However, two inter-dune areas (A
and B) contain a moderate number of features
and artifacts. Area A measures ca. 65 x 65 m and
had three hearths (F-1, 2, and 4), one mano, three
biface fragments, and five projectile points. In
addition, a pendant fragment made of kaolinite

Figure 9. Kaolinite pendant fragment found at 41PS816.

was discovered within this area (Figure 9). Area B
measures ca. 38 x 42 m and contained one hearth
(F-3), one mano, one projectile point, and a small
concentration of FCR.
The chipped stone assemblage includes debitage, bifaces, and projectile points. Debitage
consists of a variety of raw material types and
represents both hard and soft hammer reduction.
Two bifaces are noted, one an indeterminate type
biface fragment with extensive unifacial retouch
along the dorsal surface and only minimal retouch
along the ventral surface. The lateral margin along
the dorsal surface has a steep-angled bit and was
likely used as a scraper. The artifact is made of a
gray, fine-grained, opaque chert. The other biface
is a small sub-triangular, cursorily made, piece.
The distal tip and one proximal corner are missing.
This latter biface is made of a pale red and white
banded, fine-grained, opaque chert.

Walter—Archeological Investigations in the Alamito Creek Basin, Presidio County, Texas

Projectile point types indicate a wide range
of occupational episodes extending from the Late
Paleoindian to Late Archaic periods, or ca. 12,200–
1250 B.P. Two projectile points were recovered that
are associated with the Late Paleoindian period
(Figure 10a-b). One is a Golondrina (Turner et al.
2011:110–111) that is made of material macroscopically identical to Edwards Formation chert.
The lateral margins of the blade are reworked,
almost to the point of exhaustion. Both stem and
basal margins have been ground.
The second dart point is a contracting stem,
lanceolate-shaped point made of a pinkish to
reddish-gray, fine-grained opaque chert (see Figure
10b). Damage is apparent on the distal and ventral

19

surface along the lateral margin. Both lateral margins of the blade are reworked. A small area of one
side of the stem is lightly ground. The proximal
portion of the stem is more pointed than convex
and biconvex in cross section. The flaking along
both sides of the stem exhibits bilateral symmetry
and has similar attributes to the Hell Gap type
(Turner and Hester 1999:129). The Golondrina dart
point was found ca. 3.5 m from F-3 and the Hell
Gap-like dart point was found ca. 4.5 m from F-2.
Three other dart points from 41PS816 appear
to be a distinct style and are similar to diminutive
versions of the Dalton types (Figure 11a–c) (Justice
2002; Turner et al. 2011). The lateral margins of
the blades were reworked and are alternate beveled

Figure 10. Late Paleoindian projectile points found at 41PS816: a, re-worked Golondrina; b, Hell Gap-like.

Figure 11. Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic dart points recovered at 41PS816: a–c, Dalton; d, Pandale.

while the stem and basal margins are heavily
ground. Two of the points have faint shoulders, but
the shoulders on one (Figure 11b) appear to be the
result of extensive grinding along both margins of
the stem. These points exhibit impact fractures perpendicular to the transverse fracture on the distal
end. Basal thinning flakes are apparent on all three
specimens and the points are made of variegated
fine-grained opaque chert.
Another dart point (see Figure 11d) has a
minimal amount of retouch flaking on both dorsal
and ventral surfaces of the blade. A single flake
has been alternately removed on either side of
the stem with no further retouch flaking. The dart
point is an expediently made Pandale dart point
associated with the Early Archaic period (Turner
et al. 2011:168–169). Another recovered dart point
has an expanding stem and concave base and is
made of a dark gray chert. The distal end, both
shoulders, and the proximal corner of the stem are
missing. The basal edge is ground. The general
morphology of this dart point is vaguely similar to
the expanding stemmed and corner-notched series
of dart points recovered in both Late Paleoindian
and Early Archaic contexts at the Wilson-Leonard

site, and to the Baker/Bandy series of the Lower
Pecos region (Collins et al. 1998:220–223; Turner
et al. 2011:62–63).
Middle and Late Archaic dart points also
were recovered during the recording of 41PS816.
The Middle Archaic dart point resembles the
Jora type, a dart point considered by some to
be a Langtry variant (Ohl n.d.). This specimen
is made of a light brownish-gray, fine-grained,
opaque chert (Figure 12a). Two probable Late
Archaic corner-notched dart points also were
recovered; one exhibits wide corner notches and
pronounced barbs resembling the San Pedro type
(Justice 2002:202). The stem is short and slightly
expanding with a slightly convex base. It is made
of a striated gray and grayish-white, fine-grained,
opaque chert (Figure 12b). Another indeterminate
type dart point of likely Late Archaic age is highly
fragmented. The lateral margins of the blade are
damaged, the shoulders or barbs are missing, and
the proximal portion of the base is missing. The
only recognizable attribute is that the specimen is
corner-notched and has an expanding stem. This
specimen is made of a brownish-gray and white,
fine-grained, opaque chert.

Six thermal features were observed at 41PS816
and were noted as partially intact. Two of the six
thermal features were chosen for test excavations.
Two 1 x 1 m units were laid out, straddling a portion of two hearths (see Results of Excavations section below). The site was again revisited by CBBS
archeologists in June 2009 in hopes of finding additional early projectile point styles in association
with thermal features that could contain dateable
deposits. Although no additional Paleoindian and
Early Archaic type points were discovered, one
hearth was discovered partially buried at the base
of a small dune hummock. This oval-shaped hearth
was ca. 70 cm in maximum diameter and consisted
of ca. 30 igneous rocks, most of which did not show
definitive attributes of thermal alteration. Heavy
carbonate mineralization was apparent on all of the
cobbles. No dateable deposits were observed.
41PS817
Site 41PS817 is a 45 x 75 m prehistoric open
campsite situated on an alluvial flat that is draped

with small coppice dunes. The site is ca. 50 m
south of Antelope Draw. Seven hearths, debitage,
chipped stone tools, and ground stone were noted
during the survey. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered. Some of the hearths appeared intact and, therefore, they have potential to
provide chronometric and botanical data.
41PS819
Site 41PS819 is a 30 x 45 m prehistoric open
campsite. The site is located on a sandy flat ca.
500 m northwest of an ephemeral drainage in
Antelope Draw, ca. 100 m south of the Atchison,
Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, and ca. 80 m
north/northwest of 41PS813. The site has a light
scatter of debitage and FCR, and three deflated
thermal features. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable deposits were encountered. Because of the meager number and surficial nature
of artifacts, coupled with an absence of buried
and dateable deposits, the research potential for
this site is poor.

22

Texas Archeological Society

41PS820
Site 41PS820 is a 45 x 80 m prehistoric open
campsite located on a pronounced, flat-topped
ridge between and at the juncture of an ephemeral
drainage with Chambers Draw to the west, and
an unnamed ephemeral drainage to the south/
southeast. The site contains a light scatter of FCR,
debitage, and chipped and ground stone tools.
No features were observed. The ground surface
at 41PS820 was deflated with no apparent buried
deposits. Based on the absence of intact features
and dateable deposits, coupled with the absence
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, this site has a
limited research potential.
Chipped stone tools consist of a hafted biface
made of yellowish-brown jasper and an indeterminate type biface made of semi-translucent
white chalcedony. Also, a piece of shatter made of
thermally altered chalcedony was collected with
fine unifacial retouch flaking on one end. The one
ground stone tool is a shallow basin-type metate
fragment made of basalt.
Area D
Area D is directly east of Area E and is located
on the eastern side of MacGuire Ranch (see Figure
2). Landforms within this study unit include fan piedmonts, alluvial flats, plains, fan skirts, and erosion
remnants truncated by small drainage ways. Only one
site was discovered within Area D (Table 4).
41PS821
Site 41PS821 is a small prehistoric open campsite that is located on the north side of a small,
remnant playa lake. The site consists of a structural
feature and a minor lithic scatter. The feature is a
ca. 7 x 10 m oval-shaped alignment that consists
of ca. 80 stones. No entryway is apparent, and this
feature is atypical of the stacked-stone structures of
the Cielo complex. No artifacts were found within
or immediately adjacent to the feature. However,
a small artifact scatter is located ca. 2.5 m to the
east and consists of large flakes, a core, and early
stage bifaces.
Isolated Finds
The one isolated find in Area D consists of a
dart point fragment. The distal portion of the blade,

a portion of one lateral margin, the shoulders or
barbs, both margins of the stem, and a portion of
the base are missing. This specimen appears to be
corner-notched with a straight base and is suspected to be of Late Archaic period age. All specimen
fractures are the result of thermal alteration, and it
is made of a semi-translucent, fine-grained, white
chalcedony.
Area E
The northwest corner of Area E is located
ca. 1 km south of San Esteban rock shelter and
extends ca. 4 km to the south. The western boundary is adjacent to and east of the existing Atchison
Topeka and Santa Fe railroad and extends east for
ca. 4 km (see Figure 2). The most pronounced
geographic feature of Area E is a long escarpment
that rises some 90 m above the Alamito Creek
floodplain. This escarpment, or rim, is the terminus of a massive Mitchell Mesa tuff ash flow. A
small area just below this escarpment contains fan
aprons, fan skirts, and inset fans of gravelly loam
derived from the tuff. The slope just below the
escarpment consists of gravelly residuum and colluvium that has weathered from the escarpment.
To the east of the escarpment the geographic setting is a mixture of alluvial flats, plains, fan skirts,
erosional remnants, and low-lying hills truncated
by small drainages.
Special attention was given to surveying the
escarpment for rock shelters that could contain perishable materials. As a result, two small rock shelters were recorded (Table 5), both located along
the base of the escarpment. No other sites were
recorded, either below or east of the escarpment.
41PS823
Site 41PS823 is a small prehistoric rock shelter
(5.5 m deep x 6.6 m wide x 2.7 m high), located in
the face of a bluff overlooking the Alamito Creek
basin. Vegetation obscures the shelter talus. The
ceiling is smoke-blackened at the rear of the shelter, and a very light scatter of debitage is visible
at the entrance. Raw material types represented
are chalcedony and chert. Graffiti was scratched
on the back of the wall that reads “DW99.” A
single decorticate flake with unifacial retouch flaking along one lateral margin was discovered. No
carbon remains or temporally diagnostic artifacts
were noted.

41PS824
Site 41PS824 is a small prehistoric rock shelter (2.8 m deep x 4.5 m wide x 2.0 m high), also
located in the face of the bluff. A small, unnamed
ephemeral drainage is located ca. 80 m to the north.
The ceiling is smoke-blackened and debitage is
visible across a minor cultural talus that extends
ca. 4.5 m from the shelter entrance. An oval chert
biface with a steeply beveled dorsal edge was recovered. The dorsal edge exhibits unifacial retouch
flaking and appears to have served as a scraper. No
perishable material, carbon remains, or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were discovered.
The Main Stem of the Alamito
Creek Basin (Area F)
Archeological reconnaissance of the main stem
of the Alamito Creek basin (Area F) resulted in the
identification of five new sites and one extensive
site complex containing virtually hundreds of sites.
The following section provides results of these
investigations.
41PS818
As mentioned earlier, 41PS818 is actually an
archeological complex that consists of many small
rock shelters, small to large midden deposits, a
Cielo complex-like open campsite, and historic
structures and associated artifacts. This area was
separated into sub-areas designated as Kid’s Hill
locality (including the Cielo-like campsite), North
and West Extensions (the rock shelters), and South
Extension (historic structures).
The Rock shelters (West Extension)
An impressive total of 145 mostly small,
natural alcoves were investigated within an extensive, horizontally exposed tuff landform that
is part of the larger Mitchell Mesa formation
(Barnes 1979). Most of the natural alcoves occur
in the West Extension Area (Figure 13). These
small natural alcoves were formed as a result of
large gas pockets within a single-event ash flow.
Out of the 145 rock shelters, 42 contain cultural
remains (Table 6). Not only did prehistoric hunter/
gatherers make use of these small rock shelters,
but historic laborers during the construction of
the San Esteban irrigation system and the Kansas

City, Mexico, and Orient Railroad did as well
(Figure 14). Fourteen rock shelters contain only
debitage or functionally undiagnostic artifacts
and, consequently are of unknown prehistoric
affiliation. Thirteen other rock shelters contain
both prehistoric and historic artifacts. Three have
prehistoric artifacts and stacked-rock alignments
that served as walls; these stone walls most likely
are associated with the historic period. Four rock
shelters have only historic artifacts, while seven
contain stacked-rock walls with neither prehistoric nor historic artifacts.
Surprisingly, the survey team recovered only
two temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts. The
first artifact was a Cliffton type arrow point or a
Perdiz arrow point preform (Turner and Hester
1999:208; Turner et al. 2011:206) found at RR-29,
a small rock shelter (Figure 15; see Table 6). The
point is sub-triangular in shape, with minimal retouch flaking along the lateral margins of the blade,
shoulders, and stem. The arrow point has defined
shoulders with a contracting stem, and is made of
a fine-grained, opaque, brown agate.
The second artifact is a tubular stone pipe preform (Turner et al. 2011:280–283) found in a crack
between two boulders that had fallen from the
roof of a rock shelter (Figure 16 and Table 7; see
also Table 6). No cultural deposits were observed;
however, intact deposits may be present under the
fallen debris. The pipe preform is made of a very
pale brown welded tuff containing tiny vesicles.
Part of the exterior portion has been painted with
an iron oxide pigment, perhaps hematite, along
the length of the stem and partially around the
chamber rim. Very faint linear incised lines are
visible both parallel and perpendicular to the long
axis of the preform. It is unclear if these faint incisions represent the early makings of a design or
are a result of shaping the stone. The chamber or
bowl is conical in shape, and measures 29.3 mm in
maximum diameter at the opening, and it is drilled
to a maximum depth of ca. 38.0 mm. The distal
end of the preform gradually contracts towards the
proximal end of the stem. No attempts were made
to drill from the stem end. The overall dimensions
are 154.2 mm in maximum length and 55.6 mm in
maximum diameter.
The Kid’s Hill Locality
The Kid’s Hill Locality is a large cultural talus
deposit that contains a mixture of FCR, debitage,

chipped stone tools, ceramics (both prehistoric and
historic), glass, and metal artifacts. Located ca.
10 m down slope from a small rock shelter (see
Table 6: RR-37), this talus deposit was chosen for
children to learn the basic methods of survey and
excavation, hence the name “Kid’s Hill Locality”
(see Results of Test Excavations, below). The

survey involved children flagging and identifying
various surface artifacts. A rectangular-shaped
stacked-rock structure remnant is within the midden deposits (Figure 17). Field notes indicated
that the walls were ca. 10. 2 ft. wide and the south
wall was ca. 12.25 ft. long. The north end of the
structure is open and void of stacked rock. The

on a strategic well-elevated landform
that provided a panoramic view of
the Alamito Creek basin to the south
and the canyon drainage to the west
and north.
A light and diffuse scatter of
debitage and FCR were outside of
the structures while the interior of the
structures had been cleared of rocks
and contained one to three pieces of
debitage. No chipped stone tools or
projectile points were encountered.
The only temporally-diagnostic artifact is a body sherd of red-slipped

house is rectangular in shape with the long axis
orientated ca. 320 degrees north. The portions of
the walls that are still standing are of uncut fieldstone and mud mortar with chinking stones. The
walls average ca. 50 cm thick. The interior contains
mostly collapsed wall fall and vegetation. A portion
of the dirt floor is visible within the northeast corner.
No artifacts were observed inside the structure.
Historic ceramics, glass, and metal artifacts were
collected ca. 30 m east of a two-track road adjacent
to and west of the structure and ca. 15 m north of
the house. Ceramic artifacts (Figure 21) consisted
of: (1) two conjoined porcelain plate fragments with

the Wheeling Pottery Co. maker’s mark, manufacturers of dinnerware from 1879 to ca. 1910 (Kovel
and Kovel 1986:76f); (2) porcelain dinnerware fragments decorated with blue-colored floral designs; (3)
an indeterminate type fragment of vitreous, olivecolored, glazed earthenware (not salt-glazed); and
(4) a hand and forearm component to a china doll
that was produced anytime from 1840 until as late
as the 1930s (Coleman et al. 1986). Glass artifacts
included colorless, amethyst, and green-colored
glass. Both colorless and green-colored glass have
been made from ca. 1860 to the present. Amethystcolored glass, however, is a result of the use of

manganese in order to give the glass a clearer color.
Nevertheless, after time, the ultraviolet rays of the
sun turns the glass an amethyst color. Manganese
was used in glass from ca. 1880–1925 (Newman
1970:74). The finish and neck components of three
bottle fragments were collected. Finishes consist
of English Ring (deep lip or packer), prescription,
and crown types (IMACS 1992). Metal artifacts
consist of a large machine-cut nail with the distal
end missing. The nail was at least a 9d pennyweight
and more likely a 20d pennyweight when complete.

Nails that are 20d or longer were commonly used
for large construction such as framing a house, or
the construction of corrals using larger-sized milled
lumber or timber. Machine-cut nails were the most
common type of nail variety made between ca.
1830-1890, although they are still manufactured
today for special projects such as securing wood
to concrete, restorations, and remodeling projects
(Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:54–55).

with the long axis oriented ca. 320 degrees north.
The construction type is the same as House No. 1,
using field stone and mud mortar intermixed with
small angular stones. There are two door openings,
one for each room, along the southwestern wall
and interior corners. No window openings were
observed, possibly because significant portions of
the walls had collapsed. A vertical seam is present
along what was once the northeastern corner of the
northern room (Room No. 1), indicating that the
second, southern room (Room No. 2), was a later
addition. Like House No. 1, the walls are ca. 50 cm
wide. The interior dimensions of Room No. 1 are
ca. 4.2 m long x 3.6 m wide. The interior dimensions for Room No. 2 are ca. 3.6 x 3.6 m. Linear
bulldozed areas are adjacent to and perpendicular
to the northwest and southeast walls. Both bladed
areas are ca. 15–20 m long and 7–10 m wide and
have compromised the integrity of this site.
Various types of historic ceramics, glass, and
metal were noted on the surface; unfortunately,
many of these artifacts were within areas impacted
by the bulldozer. The survey crew noted the presence of whiteware, flow blue ware, and transfer

print ware, along with a fragment of a porcelain
figurine that appears to be a colonial man holding
some type of vessel. Amethyst and brown-colored
glass fragments were noted. Metal artifacts observed were evaporative milk cans, a metal hoe
blade, a .35 caliber Remington cartridge casing,
and a blasting powder can. The presence of the
blasting powder can strongly suggests that the residents of the house were at one time associated with
the construction of the Santa Fe railroad in 1929.
A clay marble and a chipped stone tool are the
only artifacts collected from this house feature. The
undecorated clay marble measures 20.50 mm in
diameter. The marble is unglazed and was probably
made of low-fired kaolin (Figure 22). Clay marbles
were produced as early as the 1700s, but were most
common from ca. 1880 until the 1920s (Randall
and Webb 1988:14–15). The second artifact is a
small biface with the proximal end and the distal
tip missing. Both lateral margins are serrated and
are at a 30˚ angle along dorsal sides of the blade.
The biface is made of fine-grained, semi-translucent, white chalcedony, and measures 37.1 mm in
length, 16.2 mm in width, and 6.2 mm in thickness.

Figure 22. Historic clay marble collected from House No. 2.

Two isolated finds were recovered within
this southern extension of the 41PS818 complex.
The first is a corner-notched, expanding stemmed
dart point. The dimensions of the point are 29.5
mm in length, 18.5 mm in width, and 5.6 mm in
thickness. It is made of an opaque, fine-grained,
white chert. The opposing shoulders are not proportionate and one lateral margin is reworked.
The vitreous luster of the chert suggests that the
material was either heat-treated or simply discarded into a fire. The second isolate was a steel
axe head with the inscription “Mann Edged Tool
Company.” The Mann Edge Tool Company was
established in 1895 and is one of the few American companies still in the business of making axes
(Lammond 2010).
The Alamito Creek Site (41PS825)
The Alamito Creek site is an extensive (ca.
420 x 1400 m) multi-component site (see Figure
34 in “Results of Excavations” section, below).
The long axis and northeastern boundary of
the site area hugs the southwest-facing side of
Alamito Creek. The southernmost portion of

the site extends only a few meters south of the
southern MacGuire Ranch boundary fence line.
An east-west bladed road parallels the boundary
fence line. The northern site boundary is located
where the Alamito Creek channel turns in a more
northerly direction. Another bladed road truncates
the site in a general northwest/southeast direction,
roughly parallel to the creek channel. Other less
traveled roads truncate the site in a general eastwest direction.
The site is situated on and along the margin of
an alluvial terrace. Surface sediments are silty clay
loam to gravelly fine sandy loam (USDS NRCS
2009). A narrow riparian zone borders the northeastern edge of the site while a desert scrubland
floral community is located in the southwestern
portion of the site.
Numerous hearths, incipient ring middens,
refuse middens, burned and fire-cracked rock scatters, chipped and ground stone tools, and debitage
are diffusely scattered across this extensive site.
The northern portion of the site area contains light
to dense scatters of historic artifacts. The surface

arrow points (Turner et al. 2011:176, 206; Mallouf
2013:202–205) is also indicative of Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric occupations (Figure 24).
Interestingly, chipped stone tools include an end
scraper (made on a flake), an unmodified blade,

37

and beveled knives (Figure 25), all typical in Cielo
complex and Perdiz-bearing tool assemblages in
the ETP/BB region (Mallouf 1999:69). Although
much of the site’s integrity was compromised by
the construction and maintenance of roads and
erosion, some features remain intact. Areas of
carbon-stained sediment indicate that dateable
deposits are present.

41PS826
Site 41PS826 is most likely a special use site
since it only consists of two circular-shaped cairns
located on the south side of a small hill. One cairn
measures 1.65 x 1.70 m and the other 2.30 x 2.50
m. The cairns are located ca. 1.65 m from one
another. The cairns are too big to be early survey
markers, but could be markers for human interments; nevertheless, the exact function of these
cairns is unknown. Although there is no solid evidence to indicate a temporal affiliation, the cairns
are suspected to be prehistoric.
41PS827
Site 41PS827 is a ca. 14 x 17 m prehistoric
open campsite located between an unnamed ephemeral drainage and Antelope Draw located ca. 200
m to the southeast. The site consists of two ringtype hearths that are ca. 12 m apart. Both hearths
measure ca. 1.0 x 1.5 m. Seven pieces of debitage
were encountered near one of the hearths. Because

39

temporally diagnostic artifacts were absent, the site
is of an unknown prehistoric affiliation.
41PS828
Site 41PS828 is an extensive historic dam and
irrigation system associated with San Esteban Lake
(Figure 26). Construction of the lake began in 1910
and was completed in 1912 by the aforementioned
St. Stephan Land and Irrigation Company, some 17
years prior to the completion of the Kansas City,
Mexico and Orient railroad (Thompson 1985, Vol.
II:71-72, 91). The TAS survey crew identified the
dam and a portion of the irrigation system. The
buttressed-type dam does not have a spillway, but
instead has three gate valves under the dam deck.
The segments of the irrigation system consist of
a concrete-lined ditch that meanders in a southsoutheast direction ca. 1,180 ft. where it connects
to a post and beam-supported metal trough that
runs in a south-southeast direction ca. 230 ft. This
trough empties into an earthen irrigation ditch that
continues in a south-southeast direction ca. 650

ft. until it enters a tunnel that runs in a southeast
direction ca. 700 ft. After exiting the tunnel, the
waterway extends another 5,675 ft. before emptying into an open field area to the southwest. In
sum, the system is ca. 1.5 miles in length. The
canal, trough, and tunnel vary from 3-6 ft. wide.
The stone rubble of a number of small buildings is
located on a terrace directly across Alamito Creek
from the tunnel entrance. Sanitation cans and
construction hardware such as nuts and bolts are
scattered along the irrigation system.
The St. Stephan irrigation company planned
to settle between 500 and 800 families on small,
irrigated farm tracts of 10, 20, and 40 acres. The
irrigation system was to provide water for an
area 11 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. Three
years after the dam was completed, the state of
Texas authorized 25,500 acre-feet of water to
irrigate 8,500 acres, but the lake started silting
in after the drought of 1928. By 1962, the lake
was reduced to 400 acre-feet to irrigate only 200
acres of land, and by 1969, the lake was limited
to recreational use only (Texas State Historical
Association 2010).
41PS831
Site 41PS831 is a large (120 x 400 m) prehistoric open campsite that is situated adjacent to and
east of Alamito Creek. An abandoned two-track
road truncates the southern portion of the site in a
general east-west direction while a small unnamed
ephemeral tributary of Alamito Creek crosses
the northernmost portion of the site in a general
north-south direction. The Kansas City, Mexico
and Orient railroad is ca. 80 m east of the western
site boundary. The southernmost portion of the site
extends an unknown distance past the MacGuire
Ranch boundary. The vegetative community is
desert scrub, although the westernmost part of the
site is adjacent to the riparian zone along Alamito
Creek. The site contains numerous hearths, a dense
scatter of debitage, along with a small number of
chipped and ground stone artifacts.
Approximately 52 hearths were noted within
the central portion of the site. Most of the hearths
average ca. 1.5 m in maximum diameter, with some
partially exposed along the walls of shallow gullies. No carbon remains were noted. Chipped stone
artifacts include unifaces, cores, and formal and
informal bifaces, including projectile points. The
presence of Bandy, Langtry, Palmillas, Shumla, and

Durango Notched dart points and a Toyah arrow
point (Figure 27) indicates that the site was occupied from Early Archaic through Late Prehistoric
times (Justice 2002:208-211; Turner et al. 2011).
The distribution of the Durango Notched type dart
points extends well beyond the core area of the
Colorado Plateau (Justice 2002:Map 22).
THE CHIHUAHUA
TRAIL SURVEY
As mentioned earlier, the Chihuahua Trail
was used mostly during the mid-19th century by
freighters traveling between Presidio and Indianola, Texas. A goal of the 2000 TAS field school
was to identify and record physical remnants of the
Chihuahua Trail and associated artifacts within the
MacGuire Ranch property. Moreover, this survey
served as a catalyst for a long-running project with
the goal of identification and reconstruction of the
trail throughout the ETP/BB (Scism 2002:13).
The Chihuahua Trail crew began work at a
previously known segment of the trail in Area F
and near the foot of San Esteban tinaja. The trail
was quite obvious in places since wagon ruts had
worn down into the bedrock (Figure 28). Where
the trail was not physically visible, a metal detector
was used to locate temporally diagnostic artifacts of
the period; the distribution of these artifacts would
hopefully help with the detection of the route of the
Chihuahua Trail. However, many historic artifacts
within this particular part of the survey area could
have been associated with the construction of San
Esteban dam and irrigation canal, the building of
the railroad, or military activities of Camp Marfa.
Consequently, a major problem for the survey crew
was to confidently identify artifacts directly associated with the trail. After the 2000 TAS field school,
members of the Chihuahua Trail Crew attended
seminars to learn more and recognize artifacts used
during this time (Scism 2002:13).
Artifacts directly associated with the trail were
not observed by the survey crew in Areas A, B, and
C, although aerial photographs clearly revealed
segments of the trail in Areas C. A small segment of
the trail may have been relocated as a result of using metal detectors ca. 120 m south of San Esteban
tinaja in Area F. Here, the survey crew detected 32
artifacts within a ca. 100 m long by ca. 20 m-wide
swath that paralleled the railroad for ca. 65 m, then
turned southeast for another 35 m.

Artifacts found during the trail survey included
cut nails, along with some metal pot fragments,
a horseshoe, a knife, and amethyst, green, and
brown-colored glass fragments. Two other recovered artifacts obviously not associated with the
Chihuahua Trail are discussed below.
Isolated Finds
Two isolated finds were discovered during the
course of the Chihuahua Trail survey. One artifact
was a metal button depicting an oriental runner
drawing a two-wheeled cart called a rickshaw that
seated one person holding an umbrella. This button
likely belonged to a Chinese railroad laborer (Figure 29). The other isolate was a Folsom dart point
preform (see Mallouf and Seebach 2006:Figure 1),

the only artifact found during the field school that
was affiliated with the early Paleoindian sub-period
(ca. 12,900-12,000 B.P. or 10,900-10,000 B.C.)
(Figure 30). The Folsom preform is made of a local, high quality, very pale brown to yellow to dark
yellowish-brown (10YR 7/4-7/6-4/4) streaked and
speckled, fine-grained, opaque chert (Table 10).
The preform is a single-flute preform as described by Tunnell and Johnson (2000:11). The
first fluting was successful along the obverse
face. The base was reworked and beveled for the
second fluting on the reverse face; however, a
platform nipple for the second fluting is absent.
The preparation of a central fluting ridge was
accomplished by the removal of ribbon flakes.

in the fundamentals of excavation and
recording, while excavations at 41PS815,
41PS816, and 41PS825 were to assess
the nature, extent, and integrity of buried
archeological deposits.
41PS815
As mentioned earlier, 41PS815 is a
small prehistoric open campsite with an
artifact concentration within a 20 x 20
m area. Six shovel tests were excavated
at 20 m intervals within the artifact
concentration. Shovel Tests 1-3 were
culturally sterile. Thin gravel lenses
were encountered at 60 cm bs. Shovel
Test 4 (ST-4) was placed within a small
coppice dune just west of the aforementioned artifact concentration. Isolated
pockets of oxidized sediment intermixed
with charcoal were encountered between

Level 2. The profile drawing of the south, west,
and north walls demonstrated discontinuous and
isolated pockets of oxidized sediment intermixed
with charcoal and a diffuse scatter of FCR. The
discontinuous nature of cultural materials indicates that subsurface integrity was likely impacted
by a combination of natural agents such as alluvial
deflation/deposition and bioturbation. An undulating and culturally sterile, compact, calcareous
loam was encountered at 29–36 cm bs. The shovel
test profiles indicate that ca. 20 cm of slightly
compact fine sandy loam overlies ca. 10–15 cm
of moderately compact sandy loam, which in turn
overlies a compact, calcareous loam. Although
the surface inspection and shovel tests did not
produce any temporally diagnostic artifacts, the
site does contain buried dateable deposits associated with thermal features and thus has potential
for further archeological research.

41PS816
As mentioned earlier, site 41PS816 is a large
(200 x 320 m) prehistoric open campsite (Figure
31) that contained thermal features, and chipped
stone and ground stone tools. Various projectile
point types indicate multiple occupations from
Late Paleoindian to Late Archaic times. Given
a close proximity of Late Paleoindian projectile
points with two hearths (F-1 and F-3), two 1 x 1 m
test units were placed over half of each feature to
expose a profile and to recover dateable matrices.
In Unit One at F-1, a number of igneous FCR
were clustered within the upper 10 cm of unconsolidated sandy loam (Level 1) in the northern half
of the unit. No carbon remains or other artifacts
were encountered in this upper level. The second level consisted of pockets of unconsolidated
sandy loam overlying an undulating and compact

tuffaceous-like surface. This underlying cemented
surface appeared to be culturally sterile. A single
medial section of an indeterminate type flake made
of fine-grained, opaque, grayish-brown chert was
recovered in the screen. In profile, F-1 had no discrete morphology, and FCR occurred within a loose
sandy loam void of carbon remains, suggesting that
the subsurface integrity of F-1 was compromised
by sheet wash action.
Unit Two in F-2 was excavated in 10 cm levels to
a maximum depth of 20 cm bs. One piece of debitage
was found on the surface and another was found in
screening. No additional FCR were encountered. The
first 9.5 cm of the deposits were a loose sand while
the lower 10.5 cm was of slightly compact sandy
loam. No dateable deposits were encountered.

Results from the excavation indicated an absence of carbon and/or botanical remains. It is noteworthy to mention that the USDA sediment profile
for this area typically consists of 1.5 m of sandy
clay loam that overlies clay loam (United States
Department of Agriculture 2009). The presence
of sand and sandy loam instead of the presence of
sandy clay loam and clay loam may have resulted
from alluvial deflation and may thus explain the
lack of intact deposits.

— Jenna Boyd (age 7 ½ years)

A cultural talus at 41PS818 was chosen for
children to learn excavation, recovery, and recording techniques that was ca. 10 m down slope from
a small rock shelter (Figure 32). The area was appropriately coined the “Kid’s Hill Locality.” The
objective was to teach children basic excavation

techniques and recording of findings. The crew was
divided into two age groups: elementary and middle
school ages. Twelve conjoining 1 x 1 m units were
placed in an L-shaped configuration—five units running north/south and seven running east/west. The
middle school students excavated the units running
north and south (Units A1–A5) while the elementary
school students excavated units running east and
west (Units A–G). With the exception of Units B
and C, Units A–G were excavated as a single level
and terminated at ca. 30 cm bs. All were excavated
to a depth of 30–40 cm bs. By the end of the field

school, midden deposits were still being exposed in
all units and continued to an unknown depth. These
units were perpendicular to and down slope from
Units A1–A5, all but one of which were excavated
to bedrock. Depths of the A1-A5 units ranged from
ca. 35–47 cm bs. Unit A5 was only excavated to 28
cm bs due to time constraints.
Sediment was reported as a gravelly loam from
alluvial and colluvial deposition with an increasing percentage of gravels with depth. The midden deposit was very dark gray to black-colored
carbon-enriched sediment intermixed with large
numbers of debitage and FCR. Subsurface deposits
contained a mix of prehistoric and historic artifacts.
No stratified cultural components or sub-features
were identified. Because of the nature of these
mixed deposits, only a limited and general discussion of the findings is provided.
A total of ca. 2,095 artifacts were recovered
during excavations. Debitage, unsurprisingly, was
the most common artifact class recovered (ca. 78
percent) and represented all phases of reduction,
including both hard and soft hammer technology;
non-cortical hard hammer flakes were dominant.
The high availability of chalcedony within the
nearby Frenchmen Hills likely explains why chalcedony was the dominant raw material. Other tool
stone types consisted of rhyolite, chert, quartzite,
jasper, felsite, mudstone, and obsidian. A single
piece of debitage made of obsidian (a soft hammer tertiary bifacial thinning flake) was submitted
for non-destructive trace element analysis (X-Ray
Fluorescence). Results of the analysis indicate that
the source is from Lago Barreal in central Chihuahua, Mexico. Although its presence is the nearest
known source other than Rio Grande secondary
deposits, it is only one of two specimens known to
occur in an archeological context in the ETP/BB
region (Shackley 2010:4-5 and Figure 1).
Chipped stone artifacts from the excavations consist of retouched and/or utilized flakes,
unifaces, bifaces, projectile points, and a single
bi-perforated, discoidal bead made of kaolinite. A
wide variety of projectile points were recovered
from the Kid’s Hill Locality and include Almagrelike, Van Horn, Livermore, Toyah, and Perdiz types
(Turner et al. 2011:169, 198, 206, 213; Zubieta
1999:24–25, 28–32), indicating that the site was
occupied from Middle Archaic to Protohistoric
times (Figure 33 and Table 11). Ground stone artifacts consist of mano and metate fragments and a
single abrading stone fragment.

47

Historic artifacts consist of solarized and green,
aqua, brown, and amethyst-colored glass. Vessel
forms that were recognized include fragments of
bottles, plates, cups, and windowpane. Ceramic
types were vitreous whiteware and Mexican
earthenware and represented tableware and storage
jars. Metal artifacts include wire nails, washers,
a sheep shear component, and banding. Based on
the presence of a solarized bottle fragment with an
applied lip and amethyst and aqua-colored glass, the
historic artifact assemblage likely dates to the early
20th century (Newman 1970; IMACS 1992).
The Alamito Creek Site (41PS825)
As described in a preceding section, the Alamito Creek site (41PS825) is a large multi-component
open campsite (Figure 34). Four features were
chosen for test excavations.
Feature 1
Feature 1 (F-1) was an incipient midden deposit that measured ca. 9 m in maximum diameter.
The feature was oval-shaped and contained carbonstained sediments. A crescent-shaped mound of
FCR was located within the southern half of the
midden. Three continuous units were placed on a
north/south grid line within the interior portion of
the feature in an area with only a sparse number
of FCR. The units were numbered from south to
north: Units 3, 1, and 2 respectively.
The three units were excavated to culturally
sterile sediment at a depth of ca. 55 cm bs. The
west wall profile indicated that there was ca. 10
cm of recent aeolian fill overlying ca. 30 cm of
carbon-stained sediment, in turn overlying sterile, yellowish-hued, calcareous sediment. Very
few artifacts were recovered from this feature. A
moderate number of FCR were encountered at ca.
20–40 cm bs, but were variable in density. Pieces
of charcoal were scattered within the units between
ca. 10–40 cm bs. Although samples were collected,
radiocarbon assays are considered problematic given their mixed context within the midden deposit.
A small amount of debitage was recovered
and represented mostly hard hammer reduction
technology. Two chipped stone tools were collected
from screening. One was an indeterminate-type,
early-stage biface made of black, fine-grained,
opaque chert that was recovered from excavated
fill within the upper 2 cm of Unit 1. The other

tool was a unifacial retouched lateral section of an
indeterminate-type flake made of white-colored
chalcedony. This specimen was encountered ca. 10
cm above the culturally sterile sediment (ca. 50 cm
bs). Raw material in the debitage was dominated
by chalcedony with a lesser number of specimens
made of chert, agate, and rhyolite. Extensive
animal burrowing was observed throughout the
excavation, especially in Unit 2.
Feature 2 and Sub-Feature 6
Feature Two (F-2) was an oval-shaped incipient
ring midden that measured ca. 9.5 m in maximum
diameter. The “ring” component was continuous
around the entire feature although vegetation obscured the eastern portion. Excavation began with
the placement of four continuous 1 x 1 m units along
a north/south base line and within the feature’s interior. The units were numbered from south to north:

Units 4, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Prior to excavation,
an Alazan type arrow point was discovered on the
ground surface 81 cm south of Unit 4 (see Figure 24).
The northwestern quadrant of Unit 3 extended into
the exposed FCR “ring” portion of the midden. A fair
amount of charcoal and bone were recovered from
the upper levels of Unit 3 and newly exposed FCR
appeared to be part of the interior slope of the ring.
After further excavation, the newly exposed rocks
were much larger and had not yet been subjected to
the degree of thermal alteration as those within the
ring. To further complicate interpretations, the rocks
in Unit 3 were clustered within the eastern portion of
Unit 3 while the western portion contained an acacia
stump surrounded by rock-free, carbon-stained sediment intermixed with charcoal and bone.
In Unit 4, bone fragments were collected from
Level 2 (20–30 cm bs) and were identified as bone
scrap (Mammalia), a burned phalange (Aves), and
five pieces of another phalange (Mammalia) that

were too fragmentary for species identification
(Willett 2010). A small basin-shaped thermal feature
was exposed in the west wall of Unit 4 and labeled
F-6, a sub-feature of F-2. This feature was first
encountered in Level 3 of Unit 4 where a charred
lechugilla leaf was found adjacent to the feature.
The feature was then pedestalled, removing the
surrounding sediment. The feature extended ca. 25
cm below the bottom of the cultural stratum and ca.
35 cm into Unit 4, and was ca. 50–60 cm wide within
the west wall profile (Figure 35). Pieces of FCR
were situated just off the edge of the pit, suggesting
that the feature might have been rock-lined. The
profile view indicates that the feature was basinshaped. A sample of feature fill was collected and the
remaining matrix was screened through 1/14-inch
mesh hardware. A sample of woody charcoal from
the F-6 fill yielded two sigma calibrated age ranges
of 530-420 B.P. (A.D 1420-1530) and 390-320 B.P.
(A.D. 1560-1630) (Beta 280028).
Feature 3
Feature 3 (F-3) is an incipient burned rock midden that measures ca. 8.0 m in maximum diameter.
Three 1 x 1 m units were placed along a north/south

51

base line and numbered from north to south, Units
1, 2, and 3, respectively. Four 10 cm levels were
excavated in Units 1 and 2, while only two levels
were excavated in Unit 3. In Level 1, FCR (n=14)
were diffusely scattered, both vertically and horizontally, across the units. A significant increase in
the number of FCR occurred in Level 2 (ca. 10–20
cm bs), with an amorphous concentration of FCR
occurring within the eastern portion of the units. A
ca. 70 x 80 cm cluster of FCR was encountered in
Level 4 in the south and north halves of Units 1 and
2 and was suspected to be a disarticulated thermal
feature. No oxidized sediment or pit outline was
noted. Two charcoal samples were collected from
within and under the FCR. Fire-cracked rock was
fairly sorted with most averaging ca. 8–12 cm in
maximum diameter. Rodent disturbance was noted
throughout the three units. Only 18 pieces of debitage was recovered in the feature excavations; the
debitage represented hard hammer reduction. Raw
material types were dominated by chalcedony,
along with some rhyolite and chert.
A profile of the east wall of the three units
was drawn, and the stratigraphy was generally described as follows: the upper 3-10 cm consisted of
recent aeolian deposition that consisted of a gray

silty loam. In Levels 2 and 3 (ca. 15-36 cm bs),
sediment consisted of a dark gray, carbon-enriched,
sandy clay loam intermixed with a small number
of pebble-sized gravels.
Feature 4
Feature 4 is located within the northern portion of the site and adjacent to the west cut bank
of Alamito Creek (see Figure 34). An approximate
50 x 50 m area contained a relatively dense scatter
of FCR, ground stone, hammerstones, and lithic
debitage that consisted of tested cobbles, cores,
flakes, and shatter. Also, discrete clusters of FCR
and carbon-stained sediment were visible at several
locations within this area and likely represented
deflated and disarticulated thermal features—the
area was designated as “Feature 4.”
Three adjoining 1 x 1 m units were originally
placed in a north/south direction (with Test Unit
1 located at the southern end) near the cut bank
of Alamito Creek to assess the presence and the
context of subsurface archeological remains. Two
contiguous units, TU-1 and TU-2, were oriented
in north/south. Although TU-3 was placed at the
northern end, the unit was never excavated. Instead, another 1 x 1 m unit, TU-4, was placed adjacent to and east of TU-1. A datum was set up at an
arbitrary elevation of 100.00 m. Four 10 cm levels
within each unit were excavated to an approximate
depth of 40 cm bs (Jameson 2009).
In TU-1, a single unspecified type of mano (not
collected) was encountered in situ within Level 1
(ca. 0–10 cm bs). Also, debitage and a single indeterminate type biface fragment made of fine-grained,
semi-translucent, white-colored chalcedony were
recovered in this level. A few FCR spalls were diffusely scattered horizontally across the level. In TU2, Level 1 produced a significantly higher number
of debitage along with a few pieces of FCR. Rodent
burrows were evident within the lower portion of the
level containing FCR and debitage. In TU-4, lithic
debitage and two small fragmentary pieces of bone
were recovered. No FCR was encountered. Sediment within Level 1 in all three units was recorded
as light brown sandy clay loam intermixed with
organic materials from the surface.
In TU-1, debitage was recovered and an indeterminate type arrow point fragment of white-colored
chalcedony was recovered in situ from Level 2 (ca.
10–20 cm bs). The specimen is thermally altered
with the distal end, sections of both lateral margins

of the blade, and the lateral margin of the stem missing. The stem is slightly contracting with a slightly
concave base. In TU-2, debitage and one small bone
fragment were recovered. A single biface fragment
and debitage were recovered from TU-4. The debitage count decreased from Level 1. Only a small
number of FCR were sporadically encountered in all
three test units. Also, small rootlets and some rodent
burrows were observed in these units.
In Level 3 (ca. 20–30 cm bs), a slight decrease
in the number of debitage was noted in TU-1 as
compared to that of the overlying level; the frequency of debitage in TU-2 and TU-4 was similar
to that of Level 2. A single burned bone fragment
was recovered from TU-2 while additional small
bone fragments were recovered in TU-4. Also, in
TU-4, one piece of modified debitage and one medial section of an indeterminate type projectile point
were recovered. The number of FCR encountered in
Level 3 for all three units remained low. All artifacts
in Level 3 were found during screen recovery. Small
rootlets and the presence of rodent burrows were
evident in Levels 2 and 3. Sediment was slightly
darker in Levels 2 and 3 and was described as a
brown sandy clay loam with an increase in calcium
carbonate content in parts of Level 3 in TU-2.
In Level 4 (ca. 30–40 cm bs), a significant drop
in debitage was noted for TU-1 and TU-2. Debitage
recovered in TU-4 remained relatively consistent
with those recovered from the overlying levels.
FCR was diffusely scattered, both horizontally and
vertically within the units. Most of the debitage
recovered came from the upper portion of Level
4. The sediment in all three units consisted of a
brown sandy clay loam, with the presence of a
caliche-enriched stratum occurring at the bottom
of the level in TU-2 and TU-4.
In addition, a pit-like feature was discovered
on the western cut bank of Alamito Creek and adjacent to the excavation area. The feature contained
a concentration of charcoal, ash, and fire-cracked
rock located ca. 27 cm above the bottom of the
pit (Figure 36). Jameson (2009) noted that photographs were taken and a macro-botanical sample
was collected for future submittal. Unfortunately,
the macro-botanical sample and profile drawing
were lost or misplaced.
Feature 5
Feature 5 (F-5) was a ca. 36 x 50 m area where
two thermal features and a relatively dense amount

of FCR, debitage, and chipped stone
tools were exposed along the apron
of a tight-knit series of small coppice
dunes. The area was ca. 15 m west/
northwest of F-3. The southern end
of this area was truncated by a general west to east-trending ranch road.
Another thermal feature was exposed
within this road and appeared to be
relatively intact. Unlike Features
1–4, there was no visible carbonstained sediment with F-5. Given
the substantial amount of artifacts
eroding out of the edge of the dunes,
it was strongly suspected that buried
and intact deposits are present.

in the discovery of 23 previously unrecorded sites.
Seventeen sites were discovered in the Marfa Plain
and associated drainages and six were discovered
within the Alamito Creek drainage (Table 12).
A total of 39 small occupied rock shelters, one
Cielo complex residential camp, and two historic
structures (all within a localized ca. 0.18 km2 area)
were lumped into a single site (41PS818) in the
Alamito Creek area, and another five sites were
recorded along the Alamito Creek drainage. Test
excavations were conducted at two sites in Area C
and two sites in Area F.
The overwhelming majority of prehistoric
open campsites discovered during the survey
were not surprisingly situated near to or adjacent
to Alamito Creek and associated drainages (e.g.,
Antelope, Chambers, Long Draw, and unnamed
drainages). Four of these sites were discovered
within the elevated grasslands adjacent to Alamito
Creek (Area A). One site with significant research
potential consists of a historic encampment and/or
special use site (41PS807) affiliated with military
maneuvers sometime in the 1920s. This site has
the potential to address research questions related
to post-Mexican Revolution defenses in the 1920s.
It is also noteworthy that a single bison ilium fragment was found within the cut bank of Alamito
Creek. To date, it is rare to find bison remains in
the ETP/BB region.
Although cultural remains were surficial,
temporally diagnostic artifacts within the highland
setting (Area B) indicate that resources within
this area were exploited during the entire Archaic
period. Within both upland and lowland environments adjacent to two draws that drain into Alamito
Creek (Area C), six of seven newly discovered sites
are situated within a 500 x 500 m area adjacent to
Chambers Draw. Although buried dateable deposits were encountered at 41PS815, the subsurface
integrity of the site has been impacted by alluvial
agents and bioturbation. Another site, 41PS816,
was repeatedly occupied from Late Paleoindian to
Late Archaic times. Unfortunately, the results of
test excavations indicated that alluvial deflation
had compromised the integrity of features and
artifacts here as well.
Only one site (41PS821) was discovered during the reconnaissance of Area D, an upland setting
that consists of a mix of various landforms, mostly
flats and plains. This site is adjacent to a playa-like
depression and consists of a single structural remnant, atypical of those of the Cielo complex. No

temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered
at the site. Two rock shelters were recorded along
the 90 m high escarpment of the Mitchell Mesa tuff
(Area E). No buried, stratified, cultural deposits
and/or temporally diagnostic artifacts were noted
in Area E.
A variety of site types were recorded near and
adjacent to Alamito Creek (Area F). This is not
surprising since major tributaries of the Rio Grande
watershed such as Alamito Creek were not only
vital freshwater resources, but supported edible
wild plants and game for people during prehistoric
and historic times. Site types contained in the archeologically complex area designated as 41PS818
consist of numerous small rock shelters, a shortterm residential site, and two historic rock structures. Other site types outside of 41PS818 consist
of open prehistoric campsites, a rock cairn, an
extensive historic dam and irrigation system, and
that portion of the Chihuahua Trail that transected
the MacGuire Ranch and a part of the adjoining
Bar Triangle Ranch.
The numerous small rock shelters at 41PS818
were occupied during prehistoric and historic
times as well. Prehistoric artifacts included FCR,
unmodified and modified debitage, ground stone,
a projectile point, and a tubular stone pipe (cloud
blower) preform. This stone pipe preform is one of
only two tubular pipe finds documented in the ETP/
BB region (Kelley et al. 1940:76; CBBS 2007).
Based on the association of tubular stone pipes
with temporally diagnostic projectile points in
other parts of Texas, the pipes are thought to have
been used from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
times (Collins 1969:39 and Table 11; Turner et al.
2011:280). A single Cliffton arrow point (a Perdiz
arrow point preform) was found in one of the small
rock shelters and indicates its Late Prehistoric use.
Historic artifacts found associated with these rock
shelters include sanitary and meat cans, nails, cartridge casings, bottle glass, and a shoe sole. Some
of the rock shelters had crude, dry-stacked walls
that protected laborers from the elements during
the construction of the San Esteban dam and irrigation system between 1910 and 1912, and the
construction of the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient
railroad line between Paisano Pass and Presidio
in 1929. Excavations at the Kid’s Hill locality (a
cultural talus below one of these small rock shelters) provided a substantial inventory of temporally
diagnostic artifacts that indicated occupation as
early as the Middle Archaic period extending into

the early part of the 20th century. Sourcing of an
obsidian artifact indicated trade/interaction of
prehistoric hunter/gatherers with the Lago Barreal
region in Chihuahua, Mexico, or possibly indirect
trade from the La Junta villagers.
A likely Cielo complex site was discovered on
a promontory at 41PS818 and is the only site that
contains prehistoric habitation structures. The presence of a single decorated El Paso brownware body
sherd suggests its Late Prehistoric affiliation. Other
localities at 41PS818 were related to the construction of the San Esteban dam and associated irrigation system and/or the Kansas City, Mexico and
Orient Railroad. These included the ruins of one
stacked-rock structure and two rock houses. Various glass, ceramic, and metal artifacts indicated an
occupation sometime between the late 1800s and
ca. 1930, coinciding with the aforementioned construction projects. It is recommended that, when
time and resources allow, each of the rock shelters
(with associated cultural materials), historic rock
houses, and the possible Cielo complex locality
should be re-recorded as separate sites and reassigned new state trinomials (including rock shelter
41PS98 recorded by Sayles in the early 1930s).
The San Esteban Dam and irrigation system
(41PS828) is significant in addressing research
domains related to early commercial land development, economic development, dam construction,
and irrigation technology for agriculture during
the early 20th century. While the Chihuahua Trail
as a whole has enormous potential to address even
earlier economic development and trade issues,
problems of identifying artifacts that are directly
associated with the trail offered little, if any, information related to operations performed by freighting endeavors, changes in freighting operations,
and habits of the travelers. The two rock houses,
mentioned above, are likely related to the Kansas
City, Mexico and Orient railroad line, and may
have research value related to the construction, operation, and economic importance of early railroad
systems in the region.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts found during the
survey indicate that the Alamito Creek site was occupied from Middle Archaic period through historic
times. The presence of both large and small thermal
features are consistent with food processing that
occurred at various levels over an extended period.
Findings from excavations at this site also indicate
the use of incipient ring middens during the Late
Prehistoric period.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
As with any project of this magnitude, the
assistance of a great many people was needed to
achieve success. While it is not possible to list
everyone who helped us along the way, I would
like to mention a few people whose contributions
were essential and greatly appreciated.
First and foremost, I extend gratitude to the
owners and manager of the MacGuire Ranch, John
and Betty Macguire and David Williams, who allowed access to their land and provided necessary
facilities, including space for a field laboratory
and a conference hall, for the 375 participants of
the field school. Also allowing access to adjacent
and nearby lands were W. B. Hubbard and Jack
Brown. Without the cooperation of these folks,
the field school could never have materialized. I
would also like to acknowledge the help of Monroe Elms, who, along with David Williams, took
the field school directors to a number of known
sites for a pre-project evaluation of the ranch’s
archeological resources.
As is typically the case, the officers and membership of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
very adeptly designed and executed the field camp
for this large group of participants. Joan Few, the
TAS 2000 president, was an active participant and
along with Anne Fox and Margie Fullen, oversaw
field laboratory activities. The field camp supervisors, Jim Blanton and Marvin Glasgow, overcame
all obstacles and kept the camp running smoothly
and efficiently, even when the traditional TAS
deluge of biblical proportions arrived towards the
end of the project. Jerry Grubis and Bob Crosser
comprised the mapping team, and although faced
with an enormous workload, they successfully
mapped a large number of the sites chosen for
excavations.
Field school directors for the project were
Robert Mallouf and Andy Cloud of the Center for
Big Bend Studies at Sul Ross State University.

Walter—Archeological Investigations in the Alamito Creek Basin, Presidio County, Texas

Dawn Temple served as field assistant to the
directors, and, subsequent to fieldwork, played
a major role in organizing and structuring the
data recovered during the course of the project.
Persons assigned as supervisors of the seven
survey area crews included Johnny Byers (Area
A), Bret Williams (Area B), Jay Hornsby (Area
C), Bill Chaney (Area D), James Smith (Area E),
Margaret Howard and Andie Comini (Area F),
and Bob Shelby (Area G). It fell to Jim Warren’s
determined crew to locate and document the 100+
rock shelters associated with an extensive tuff
exposure in Area F.
Subsurface investigations at selected individual sites were supervised by Joan Few, Pat
Mercado-Allinger, and Doug Boyd (Kid’s Hill
site); Bryan Jameson, Elton Prewitt, and Bill
Parnell (Alamito Creek site); Wayne Clampitt
(Lost Pottery site); Gerald Humphries, Sue Gross,
and Steve Carpenter (Windy Springs site); Jimmy
Smith and Glynn Osburn (Gallie site); Sam Cason
and Art Tawater (Metate site); Tom Alex, Mac
Hibbetts, and Preston McQuarter (Perdiz Creek
site); and Bill Sherman and Joe Nichols (Marfa
Lake Paleontological site). Joe Nichols also
served as soil scientist for the project.
Investigations at the historic Davis-Herrera
home site, located to the south of the main project
area in Plata, were under the direction of Lou Fullen and Brenda Whorton, who were assisted with
technical expertise by Dick Gregg. The historic
Chihuahua Trail crew was led by Vicki Scism,
Elvis Allen, and Smitty Schmiedlin.
Rock art recording was carried out at San
Esteban Rockshelter under the direction of Teddy
Lou Stickney, Reeda Peel, and Bob Hext. The
shelter was instrument-mapped by Robert Mallouf
and his students from Sul Ross State University
in 1999, just prior to the TAS field school in
2000. TAS subsurface testing of the shelter floor
deposit was carried out under the supervision of
Jim Corbin and Debra Beene.
Special evening programs for TAS participants and visitors were provided by Robert Mallouf, Andy Cloud, Dan Potter, David Alloway,
John Yates, Frank Daugherty, Gerald Raun, and
Bob Hext. Special studies of materials recovered
during the field school were carried out by Phil
Dering (macro-botanical), Steve Shackley (obsidian), and Sarah Willet (faunal).
