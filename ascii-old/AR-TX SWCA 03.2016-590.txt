Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Southwest Texas Telephone Company Inc. (STTC), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the Texas Ranch Road (RR) 335 Fiber Optic
Cable Extension Project (Project) in Edwards and Real Counties, Texas. The Project involves the
installation of approximately 7.5 miles of fiber optic telecommunication cable for STTC. The cable will be
installed within the right-of-way of RR 335 in southeastern Edwards County, Texas, with portions being
overhead (±2.2 miles) and the remaining ±5.3 miles being installed underground via trenching. Overall, the
Project’s area of potential effects (APE) is approximately 7.5 miles long, 20 feet wide, and 4 to 5 feet in
depth, encompassing about 18 acres. In locations (e.g., roads and drainages) where the buried utility will
be horizontally directional drilled, impacts may extend to a depth of approximately 10 feet.
Because the proposed Project occurs on land owned by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),
a political subdivision of the state, the work was performed in compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7797. The investigations included a cultural resources
background review, an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey with shovel testing, and a review of
standing historic structures in and near the APE. The background literature review determined that no
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the APE, however, one archaeological site (41ED4)
has been documented within the proposed Project area. The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps
revealed no known historic-age structures within the current Project area, however 14 are located adjacent
to the APE.
Field investigations involved the excavation of 49 shovel tests and examination of the ground surface and
exposed profiles. The proposed APE is situated in a highly modified easement along the edges of RR 335,
and as such, there was a significant amount of disturbance throughout the Project area. During these
investigations, SWCA revisited one previously recorded site (41ED4) and documented two previously
unrecorded prehistoric sites (41ED283 and 41ED284). In addition, 19 standing structures were documented
within the indirect APE.
SWCA archaeologists were unable to locate previously recorded site 41ED4 within the APE; the site is
either destroyed or located beyond the Project area. Sites 41ED283 and 41ED284 are both prehistoric sites
with eroded burned rock features and diffuse surficial lithic scatters. Due to the lack of soil deposition,
absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts and intact cultural features, and ubiquity of the site type in the
region, the portions of sites 41ED283 and 41ED284 within the APE have limited potential to yield new or
important information regarding regional prehistory. Based on these findings, SWCA recommends that the
part of sites 41ED283 and 41ED284 within the APE are not eligible for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) or for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further cultural resources
investigations are warranted within the current APE.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify cultural resources within the Project area. No properties were identified within the
direct APE that may meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation
as an SAL, as per 13 TAC 26.10. Therefore, SWCA recommends that no additional cultural resources
investigations should be warranted within the Project area, as currently defined.
The cultural resources investigations also included an assessment of indirect effects on aboveground
resources within a 164-foot buffer area to either side of RR 335 (the indirect APE). Of the 19 standing
structures documented within indirect APE, only one, the 1917 Vance Baptist Church and adjacent 1875
Vance Cemetery, may be potentially eligible for the NRHP. The Project should have no direct effect on this
potentially NRHP-eligible resource, nor will the addition of an aboveground fiber optic line adversely affect
the viewshed, because elevated utility lines are already in place in the area.

Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Southwest Texas Telephone Company Inc. (STTC), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed STTC 7.5-mile-long Texas
Ranch Road (RR) 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project (Project) in Edwards and Real Counties, Texas
(Figure 1). The Project involves the installation of approximately 7.5 miles of fiber optic cable to be
installed within the right-of-way (ROW) of Texas RR 335 in southeastern Edwards County, Texas, with
portions being overhead (±2.2 miles) and the remaining ±5.3 miles being installed underground via
trenching. Because the proposed Project would occur on land owned by the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT), a political subdivision of the state, the work was performed in compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
Investigations consisted of a cultural resources background review, a 100 percent intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the Project area, and documentation of potential historic-age
standing structures in the indirect area of potential effects (APE). The purpose of the work was to locate
and identify prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the Project area, establish vertical and
horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with regard to the Project area, and evaluate the significance and
eligibility of any site recorded within the property for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
or for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Archaeological investigations were performed to
comply with the ACT under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7797. All investigations were conducted in
accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
standards.

PROJECT PERSONNEL
Ken Lawrence, M.A., served as Principal Investigator and Tina Nielsen served as Project Manager for the
duration of the Project, overseeing overall logistics and organization, managing reporting, and agency
consultation. The survey was completed by Field Director Daniel Rodriguez, M.A., and Archaeologist
Tatiana Martinez on October 5–6, 2016, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7797. Architectural Historian,
Victoria Myers, M.A., performed a desktop review of the standing structures documented adjacent to the
survey area. Carole Carpenter expertly produced all field and report maps for the Project and Lauri Logan
provided technical editing and document preparation.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The Project area traverses portions of Edwards and Real Counties in the Edwards Plateau. Beginning in the
city of Barksdale, Texas, the STTC fiber optic line extends roughly northeast to the city of Vance, Texas,
along the western ROW of RR 335 before terminating east of the junction of RR 335 and County Road
(CR) 2631 (see Figure 1). This route traverses existing TxDOT ROW. With the exception of the proposed
cable route in the cities of Barksdale and Vance, Texas, the Project area is within the Nueces River valley,
which is largely agricultural with rural habitation and scattered pastures on the floodplain of the river and
alluvial fans of the tributary valleys. Overall, the Project alignment gradually rises in elevation from the
southern end northward, but the alignment does cross multiple upland ridges (Figure 2). Known
disturbances along the Project area include vegetation clearing, agricultural activities, buried and overhead
utilities, construction and maintenance of numerous roadways, and erosion.

The proposed Project’s APE is defined as the approximately 20-foot-wide by 7.5-mile-long cable route.
Current design plans indicate that approximately 2.2 miles of the route will be installed aboveground, with
the remaining 5.3 miles requiring trench excavation and/or horizontal directional drilling (HDD)
installation. Overall, the Project’s APE is approximately 7.5 miles long, 20 feet wide, and 4–5 feet in depth,
encompassing about 18 acres. In locations where the buried utility will require HDD (e.g., roads and
drainages), impacts may extend to a depth of approximately 10 feet.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
The proposed Project alignment traverses southeastern Edwards County and southeastern Real County in
south-central Texas. The Project area is located at the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau physiographic
region of Texas (Wermund 2016). A physiographic province is characterized as a region with shared
geology, vegetation, fauna, and climate. The Edwards plateau is distinguishable from surrounding
physiographic regions by its prominent Cretaceous-age limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and shale deposits.
The eastern and southern extent of the Edwards Plateau is clearly demarcated by the uplifted and elevated
Balcones Escarpment, which divides the plateau from the Blackland Prairie and South Texas Plain
physiographic regions. The northern and western extent of the Edwards Plateau is relatively flat in
comparison to the eastern and southern plateau margin, with the plateau slowly grading into mountain and
basin physiographic regions in the west and plains regions in the north. Additionally, the Project area is
situated within the Balconian biotic regions and Edwards Plateau vegetative region (Blair 1950; Correll and
Johnston 1979).

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology throughout the Project area consists of four primary formations (Figure 3). In the
uplands on the southern and central areas of the Project are Cretaceous-aged Edwards, Glen Rose, and
Devils River Limestones, undivided (USGS 2016). The Edwards formation consists of limestone, dolomite,
and chert (nodules); based on the age and physical properties of this formation, it has virtually no potential
to contain buried archaeological resources. Prehistoric groups would have exploited the available chert
nodules for manufacturing stone tools; therefore, sites are anticipated in the rocky uplands near these
outcrops.
The Glen Rose Formation consists of limestone, clay, some sandstone and sand with a stair step topography.
Similarly, overlying the Glen Rose Formation is the Devils River Formation, consisting of limestone,
dolomite, lime mudstone, and localized chert (nodules). Again, based on the age and physical properties of
these formations, there is virtually no potential to contain buried archaeological resources.
The final formation occupying the lowland portions of the Project area, particularly at the northern end, is
Quaternary deposits. These deposits include sand, silt, clay, and gravel with locally indurated calcium
carbonate (caliche); this landscape includes point bar, natural levee, stream channel, sand dune, terrace,
alluvial fan, and playa deposits (USGS 2016). Regionally, these deposits have been consistently shown to
have a good potential for containing buried archaeological deposits.

SOILS
Project area soils are a mosaic of several soil units (Figure 4). These include, in order of predominance, the
Real-Oplin Complex (37 percent); Mailtrail-Mereta complex (23.1 percent); Campwood-Knippa complex
(14.5 percent); Dev-Riverwash complex (12.5 percent); Nuvalde clay loam (7.5 percent); Pratley clay (2.4
percent); Riverwash and Dev soils (2.0 percent); and Oakalla-Dev complex (1.0 percent) (Natural
Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2016).

The soils with the best potential to contain buried archaeological materials within the Project area are the
Dev-Riverwash complex, Riverwash and Dev soils, and Oakalla-Dev complex, as these soils are found in
proximity to stream terraces and developed from calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone parent
material. The remainder of the soils within the Project area are typically shallow to very shallow over
limestone bedrock (NRCS 2016).

FLORA
The Project area is situated on the Edwards Plateau within the Balconian biotic province, an Edwards
Plateau vegetative region (Blair 1950; Correll and Johnston 1979). The Edwards Plateau forms a sharp
boundary in floral distribution between the thin-soiled limestone uplands and the wide coastal plains to the
southeast. Upland areas are dominated by a mixed live oak (Quercus virginiana) and Ashe juniper
(Juniperus ashei) woodland interspersed with occasional grassy openings. Other tree species present in low
densities throughout these areas include cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) and Texas oak (Quercus fusiformis).
Shrub density varies from low to dense in upland areas. Species occurring in low densities include Texas
persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) with thick,
mixed grasses in some areas (Van Auken 1988). The lower elevation areas along the riparian zone often
include a dense understory of acacia (Acacia spp.), prickly pear, and other brushy species (Petrides 1988;
Simpson 1988).

FAUNA
The Balconian biotic province is a transitional zone from the mesic forests of eastern North America to the
xeric grasslands of the central United States; thus, this province has a high faunal diversity. Blair (1950)
identified at least 57 species of mammals, over 42 species of reptiles, and 15 species of amphibians. None
of the fauna for the Balconian is restricted solely to this province (Blair 1950).
Some mammals common to the Balconian province include: coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped
skunk (Mephitis mephitis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), valley pocket
gopher (Thomomys bottae), and badger (Taxidea taxus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976). Historically, red
wolf (Canis rufus), bison (Bison bison), and black bear (Ursus americanus) ranged into or near this region
(Burt and Grossenheider 1976).
The general reptilian assemblage for this province include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon
flavescens flavescens), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), and the Gulf
Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Kutac and Caran 1994).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING
The Project area lies within the Central Texas archaeological region, as defined by Collins (2004), Prewitt
(1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), and other researchers. The Central Texas archaeological region is an artificial
construct and its boundaries are somewhat arbitrary (Collins 2004:102). As Collins (2004:103) points out,
it is unlikely that any group in the past 11,000 years had their key resources, geographic range, or political
sphere conform to these boundaries. This area is noted by its distinctive environmental conditions, as it is
located at the boundary of the moist, humid forests to the east and drier, savannah-like grasslands to the
west, which greatly influenced cultural development.

The following cultural-historic outline is based on the regional chronologies proposed by Collins (2004)
and Johnson and Goode (1994), which build upon the seminal efforts of Prewitt (1981, 1985) and Suhm
(1960). Using standard terminology, the cultural sequence is divided into four periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The Archaic period is subdivided into four subperiods: Early,
Middle, Late, and Transitional.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about 11,500 to 8800 years before present (B.P.) and are not
uncommon in Central Texas (Collins 2004). The period begins at the close of the Pleistocene with the
earliest evidence of humans in the Central Texas region. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include
lanceolate-shaped, fluted projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview types. These projectile
points were hafted onto wooden spears, launched from atlatls (spear throwers), and used to hunt a variety
of game, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989). During the Paleoindian
period, the prominent interpretation suggests a hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy with increased
harvesting of flora and small game as the big game died off and the climate warmed following the end of
the Pleistocene ice age (Bousman et al. 2004). Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites include
Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and St. Mary’s Hall.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to a close, humans began more intensively to harvest local floral and faunal
resources (Collins 2004). Material culture became more diverse and the use of burned rock middens and
ovens became widespread. This period is known as the Archaic and dates from approximately 8800 to
1200 B.P. in Central Texas (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). While Collins (2004) and Johnson
and Goode (1994) subdivide the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods, we have added a
transitional subperiod after the Late Archaic for reasons discussed below.
EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 2004:119). Research suggests that
Early Archaic people became increasingly reliant on local resources and residential mobility decreased
(Prewitt 1981:73; Suhm et al. 1954:18). Early Archaic populations utilized base camps for longer periods,
perhaps seasonally, and hunted a diverse array of small (e.g., snakes, turtles, rodents, rabbits), medium (e.g.,
opossums and raccoons), and large (e.g., deer and antelope) game, fished local rivers, and cooked wild plant
bulbs in earth ovens. It is likely that the reduction in residential mobility was related to a variety of factors
including diminished bison populations, population increase, tribal territoriality issues, and climatic change.
By the start of the Early Archaic, well-established resident populations lived in every biogeographical
region of Texas.
Collins (2004:120) and McKinney (1981) observe that a large number of Early Archaic sites are
documented along the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau. They argue that if our current
understanding of Early Archaic site distribution reflects prehistoric land use, then the Early Archaic was a
period when people were living in the better-watered parts of the Edwards Plateau. With very low
population densities across the state at the beginning of the Archaic, it makes sense that the environmentally
desirable zones, such as the well-watered ecotone along the margins of the Edwards Plateau, would be the
first areas to have been more heavily settled.
During the Early Archaic, projectile points became more regionally diversified, and stemmed forms
replaced the lanceolate points of the Paleoindian period. This technological shift may have been due, in

part, to the development of a more localized, broad-based hunting and gathering economy that necessitated
differing point types for different game (Johnson and Goode 1994; Story 1985). Early Archaic populations
supplemented their hunting diet with a diverse assemblage of processed plant foods. This is most evident
through the use of hot rock cooking technologies, which become commonplace at Early Archaic sites. Early
Archaic burned rock features are most often small- to medium-sized hearths, with minimal evidence of
reuse. However, at a few Early Archaic sites (e.g., Wilson-Leonard), larger earth ovens have been
documented (Collins et al. 1998; Prewitt 1985); these are believed to be the precursors to burned rock
middens.
A burned rock midden is a large, dense feature of burned rocks and ash-stained soil that accumulates from
use and reuse as a thermal cooking feature (Black et al. 1997; Mahoney et al. 2003; Suhm 1960). The
number of burned rock middens increased throughout the Archaic period and it seems clear that their
technological roots lie in the first earth ovens of the Early Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Collins et al. 1998;
Decker et al. 2000). Burned rock midden technology appears to have first developed in the eastern plateau
around 8500 to 8000 B.P. and gradually spread into the western plateau by ca. 6500 to 5000 B.P. (Decker et
al. 2000:301). These large features vary greatly in size and form, but share the common functional purpose
of serving as an earth oven or similar cooking device (Black et al. 1997; Weir 1976).
Work completed on the Gatlin site, 41KR621, in southern Central Texas highlighted the complexity and
diversity in the Early Archaic settlement system noted by previous researchers (Houk et al. 2008). As
Johnson (1991:159) states, “people acquired different foods at different suitable places,” meaning that
certain sites were visited repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Johnson (1991:160) speculated that people in the
eastern part of Central Texas may not have had large base camps, instead they traveled from site to site in
small groups; the Gatlin site data for the Early Archaic period supports this hypothesis. In fact, based on a
study conducted as part of the Gatlin site analysis, only the Wilson-Leonard site was classified as an Early
Archaic base camp out of 16 well-documented Early Archaic components in Central Texas. The other sites
all appear to represent short-term, specialized activity sites (Houk et al. 2008).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC
The Middle Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 2004:120). During the beginning
of the Middle Archaic, from approximately 5750 to 5250 B.P., Johnson and Goode (1994:73) contend that
a brief warm and dry period arose. Hudler (2000) also documents a major climatic shift towards warmer
and drier conditions ca. 5300 B.P., followed by a very brief wet interval. Johnson and Goode (1994:73) also
believe this dry period was followed by a short period of climatic amelioration between 5250 to 4600 B.P.,
with moderately wet and cool conditions.
The Middle Archaic is marked by a significant increase in archaeological sites on the Edwards Plateau. It
is difficult to determine if this increase is due to a larger, denser population or an increase in residential
mobility. In either case, there is abundant evidence that settlement and subsistence became more regionally
specialized during this time. Burned rock hearths, scatters, and concentrations are common at Middle
Archaic sites; however, none of these features is more pronounced than the burned rock midden, the use of
which proliferated during the Middle Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Prewitt 1981; Shafer 1988). There is
widespread evidence supporting an increased reliance on the processing of geophytes and succulent plant
bulbs such as sotol, yucca, and lechuguilla in burned rock middens (Dering 1999).
The three distinct types of burned rock middens documented during the Middle Archaic are 1) sheet
middens, 2) dome middens, and 3) annular middens (Mahoney et al. 2003). Sheet middens are loose
accumulations of displaced and mixed burned rocks, usually derived from several burned rock features.
The rock displacement may be caused by natural or cultural processes, including erosion, flooding, feature
maintenance, and/or reuse. Dome middens are round, dome-shaped accumulations of burned rock that can

be several feet thick. Dome middens form through repeated feature use and maintenance, thus resulting in
a massive, dense accumulation of burned rock. Annular middens (also called crescent, ring, or donut
middens) are circular or semicircular-shaped accumulations of burned rock with a centralized depression.
Like dome middens, they may be several feet thick.
Early Triangular dart points appear in the beginning of the Middle Archaic subperiod, around 5300 B.P. at
the Gatlin site (Houk et al. 2008:Figure 13.2). This unstemmed type co-occurs with Bell and Andice points,
which are basally notched, stemmed point forms (Mahoney et al. 2003; Sorrow et al. 1967). Wyckoff’s
(1995) research suggests that Bell and Andice points (also known as Calf Creek points) are intrinsically
linked to bison hunting. Their appearance at the beginning of the Middle Archaic is presumably related to
the return of bison to the area ca. 5000 B.P. Nolan and La Jita points, which have square to rectangular
stems with weak, rounded, or abrupt shoulders, appear in the Central Texas archaeological record ca.
4800 B.P. and persist into the beginning of the Late Archaic (Houk et al. 2008: Figure 13.2).
LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic began around ca. 4000 B.P. and lasted until ca. 1200 B.P., ending when the bow and arrow
was introduced into Central Texas (Collins 2004:121). Late Archaic sites are more numerous than earlier
Archaic period sites (Black 1989; Collins 2004), and some researchers argue that population increased
during the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994; Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). Increasingly complex
cultural manifestations are characterized in the Late Archaic archaeological record and increased population
size may have contributed to this complexity (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Territoriality issues may have also been more commonplace in the Late Archaic. This argument is
somewhat supported by the development of more formal cemeteries in many areas of Texas (Hall 1981;
Lukowski 1987; Taylor and Highley 1995). Burials from these cemeteries often contain grave goods, such
as marine shell ornaments (from the Texas coast), boatstones (from Arkansas), and corner tang knives (from
the Edwards Plateau). The presence of these items ultimately suggests that plateau populations participated
in some form of a trade system during the Late Archaic (Hall 1981).
Compared to previous subperiods, an extremely diverse assemblage of projectile point forms was utilized
during the Late Archaic. Pedernales, Kinney, and Tortugas points appeared at the beginning of the period.
Pedernales points have bifurcated stems and a narrow to broad, often leaf-shaped blade (Turner and Hester
1999). Montell, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Castroville, and Shumla points appear slightly later
and for the most part are all broad-bladed points that generally have expanding stems and prominent, barbed
shoulders. Many of these early Late Archaic points were apparently used for bison hunting (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968).
Hot rock cooking technologies developed in previous periods continued to be employed during the Late
Archaic, and burned rock middens are a very common Late Archaic site feature. Many of the burned rock
middens that formed during the Middle Archaic continued to be used by Late Archaic peoples (Black et al.
1997).

LATE ARCHAIC TO LATE PREHISTORIC TRANSITION
As Collins (2004:122) notes, “diverse and comparatively complex archaeological manifestations toward
the end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence of types of human conduct without precedent in Texas.”
As is discussed in detail elsewhere in this report, various labels—Transitional Archaic (Johnson et al. 1962;
Turner and Hester 1999), Terminal Archaic (Black 1989), and Late Archaic II (Johnson and Goode 1994)—
have been applied to the end of the Archaic period. Although the names differ, these competing schemes
generally begin after Marcos points appear in Central Texas, encompass the Fairland-Ensor-Frio point style

intervals, and end with the Darl point type. The succeeding Late Prehistoric period began ca. 1200 B.P. with
the introduction of the bow and arrow into Central Texas; the first widespread arrow point type was
Scallorn, and it is commonly associated with the Austin phase/interval, or Late Prehistoric I (Collins 2004;
Johnson and Goode 1994). Bone-tempered ceramics are also indicative of the Late Prehistoric period,
specifically the Toyah phase/interval, as will subsequently be discussed.
By the early part of the Late Archaic period, Central Texas was occupied by broad-spectrum foragers
specializing in the resources available within specific ranges or territories. Arnn (2007:274–275) argues
that the stabilization of climatic patterns during the Late Archaic allowed area-specific cultural material to
emerge throughout the region. For example, the intensification in plant processing, evidenced by increased
accumulation of rock oven features and burned rock middens, suggests an increasing reliance on a resource
that is essentially fixed on the landscape (Arnn 2007:277).
Late Archaic groups did not exist in isolation, and the eventual spread of most Late Archaic point styles,
particularly the later style types, as well as exotic materials such as marine shell and perhaps religious ideas,
throughout the state suggests their participating in a “vast web of social relations” (Arnn 2007:277).
Decorated bone ornaments, Gulf whelk shells, and atlatl weights of exotic stone are among the new types
of materials to appear during the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). Exotic materials are recovered
from domestic contexts, as well as burials, suggesting they were a pervasive component in the life of Late
Archaic peoples (Arnn 2007:277).
The end of the Archaic, then, was an interesting time in Central Texas; one that we are still struggling to
understand. Arnn (2007:278–279) argues “that the Late Archaic Period may be viewed as a precursor (in
terms of technology, subsistence, and settlement practices) to similar technologies and practices observed
during the Late Prehistoric.” Framing the research within that context, one of continuity rather than change,
may be a useful approach for investigating the transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. As is
discussed elsewhere, Johnson and Goode (1994:40) characterize the termination of the Late Archaic as the
most difficult and complex of all the period boundaries, noting that it may have ended either 400 years later
with the Toyah phase, or even 400 years earlier, when small dart points types like Darl appeared.
As previously noted, the end of the Archaic period is marked by the appearance of a variety of small, sideand corner-notched dart point types including Fairland, Frio, Ensor, Ellis, and Edgewood (Turner and
Hester 1999). Johnson and Goode (1994:37) point to social interaction with the eastern United States as a
possible source for these new point types. These projectiles may have been part of a package of new cultural
items related to the spreading of Eastern religious ideas as far as the Edwards Plateau—these included the
exotic items noted above, such as marine shells and atlatl weights (Johnson and Goode 1994:37).
An important cultural trait of the Late Archaic is the appearance of formal cemeteries off the Edwards
Plateau; on the plateau, sinkholes continued to be used as repositories for the dead. Cemeteries, where many
of the exotic items noted above have been found, suggest that groups were tied to specific territories.
Cemeteries are more common in the early Late Prehistoric, and many individuals buried in them show clear
evidence of violent deaths (Johnson and Goode 1994:40). Prewitt (1982:Table 4) provides an exhaustive,
if somewhat dated, list of cemeteries and burials in eastern Central Texas, and notes many incidences of
Scallorn arrow points either with a skeleton or clearly imbedded in the skeleton.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and later, ceramics, into Central Texas, marked the Late Prehistoric
period. Population densities dropped considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt 1985:217).
Subsistence strategies did not differ greatly from the preceding period, although bison again became an
important economic resource during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt 1981:74). Use of

rock and earth ovens for plant food processing and the subsequent development of burned rock middens
continued throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al. 1997). Horticulture came into play very late
in the region, but was of minor importance to overall subsistence strategies (Collins 2004:122).
In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period generally is associated with the Austin and Toyah phases
(Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82–84). Austin and Toyah phase horizon markers and Scallorn-Edwards and
Perdiz arrow points, respectively, are distributed across most of the state. Violence and conflict often
marked introduction of Scallorn and Edwards arrow points into Central Texas, with many excavated burials
containing these point tips in contexts indicating they were the cause of death (Prewitt 1981:83).
Subsistence strategies and technologies (other than arrow points) did not change much from the preceding
Late Archaic period. Prewitt’s (1981) use of the term “Neoarchaic” recognizes this continuity. In fact,
Johnson and Goode (1994:39–40) and Collins (2004:122) state that the break between the Austin and Toyah
phases could easily and appropriately represent the break between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Landscape features have dictated human movement and subsistence patterns for thousands of years.
Specifically, geographical influences during the Historic Period (A.D. 1630 to present) confined settlements
to riparian zones and limited farming to these areas. The surrounding rugged landscape was used for sheep,
goat, and cattle ranching. These practices were introduced and promoted by the Spanish as part of their
colonial agenda and many were carried through to the twentieth century, giving Texas a strong agricultural
history which dominated economic, social and cultural patterns over the years (Freeman 1994).
Accordingly, the following historic context emphasizes the changes to rural Texas in terms of its
agricultural and economic history. These developments in effect dictate the social and political development
of Central Texas as seen against the backdrop of broader Texas history in and around the Project area.
The beginning of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries was an era of more permanent contact
between Europeans and Native Americans as the Spanish moved northward out of Mexico to establish
settlements and missions on their northern frontier (see Castañeda [1936–1958] and Bolton [1970] for
extended discussions of the mission system and Indian relations in Texas and Central Texas region). There
is little available information on aboriginal groups and their ways of life, except for the fragmentary data
Spanish missionaries gathered. In the San Antonio area and areas to the south, these groups have been
referred to collectively as Coahuiltecans because of an assumed similarity in way of life, but many
individual groups may have existed (Campbell 1988). This area also served as a point of contact between
the southward-advancing Apaches and the Spanish, with native groups often caught in between. Disease
and hostile encounters with Europeans and intruding groups such as the Apache were already wreaking
their inevitable and disastrous havoc on native social structures and economic systems by this time.

SPANISH COLONIAL/MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1630–1820)
The Spanish Colonial period (A.D. 1630–1821) may be characterized as the initial period of
Aboriginal/European contact and European settlement in Texas. During this time, Central Texas was
inhabited by several aboriginal groups including the Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, and Lipan Apache
(Thompson 2011). Motivated more by a fear of French expansion than anything else, the Spanish explored
and established missions in eastern and Central Texas during the latter part of the seventeenth century
(Foster 1995). These early overland Spanish entradas utilized established aboriginal trade routes, with the
first being led by Governor Alonso de Léon (1689 and 1690) (Foster 1995). José de Urrutia led the Spanish
campaign against Apaches in 1739. In 1754, Pedro de Rabago y Teran passed through on his way to the
lands surrounding the San Saba River. Other early Spaniards in the area included Diego Ortiz Parrilla, who
led a campaign against the Apaches in 1759, and the Marques de Rubi, who led an inspection of the northern

Frontier of New Spain in 1767 (Thompson 2011). In 1808, Capt. Francisco Amangual commanded a
military expedition from San Antonio to Santa Fe intended as a show of strength to the Plains Indians.
Establishment of the mission system in the first half of the eighteenth century to its ultimate demise around
1800 brought the peaceful movement of some indigenous groups into mission life, but others were forced
or moved in to escape the increasing hostilities of southward-moving Apaches and Comanches. Many of
the Payaya and Juanca lived at Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo), but so many died there that
their numbers declined rapidly (Campbell 1988:106, 121–123). By the end of the mission period, European
expansion and disease and intrusions by other Native American peoples had decimated many local
indigenous Native American groups. The small numbers of surviving Payaya and Juanca were acculturated
into mission life, with the last references to the Payaya and Juanca recorded in 1754 and 1789, respectively,
in the waning days of the mission (Campbell 1988:98, 123). By that time, intrusive groups such as the
Tonkawa, Apache, and Comanche had moved into the region to fill the void. Outside of the missions, few
sites attributable to these groups have been investigated. To complicate matters, many aboriginal ways of
life endured even after contact with the Spanish. For example, the manufacture of stone tools continued
even for many groups settling in the missions (Fox 1979). The nineteenth century brought the final
decimation of the Native American groups and the U.S. defeat of the Apaches and Comanches and their
removal to reservations.

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS/PRE-CIVIL WAR (1836–1860)
During the Republic of Texas era, from 1836 to 1845, the Central Texas area remained an Indian stronghold
until the 1860–1870s. On December 29, 1845, Congress signed the Texas Admission Act, the result of
several years of annexation debate. A few months later, on February 19, members of the newly formed state
government conducted a ceremony in front of the Capitol at Austin marking Texas’ official annexation into
the Union and the end of the Republic of Texas (Campbell 2003:186; Miller and Faux 1997:78).

THE POST-CIVIL WAR TO TWENTIETH CENTURY (1865–1950)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruction period. To begin reconstruction, federal
troops, in part, had to spread the word of the Emancipation Proclamation (Campbell 2003:268). In
Galveston on June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger and the Union army spread the word of the slaves’
emancipation (Campbell 2003:268). Thus, this day became known as ‘Juneteenth’ and has been celebrated
by Texas African Americans ever since (Campbell 2003:268).
Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s, and Central Texas counties experienced a period of “mob
rule.” Citizens formed an anti-mob organization, but competing groups conducted essentially open warfare.
After several people were killed, the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area and order was eventually
restored (Murphy 2016).
Recovery during this period was gradual, but was assisted by a diverse agricultural economy particularly
cattle. In the 1870s, several major cattle trails heading to markets passed through Central Texas. One
invention that had an effect on Texas and its economy during this time was barbed wire. Barbed wire, first
demonstrated in 1871, enabled ranchers to alter land and control cattle in a less-intrusive, more profitable
manner, and brought additional commerce and trade to central and South Texas (NRHP 1976). Though
barbed wire was one of the largest influences on Texas in general, the most influential ‘invention’ on the
region was the railroad. The railroads effectively served as a means of transportation and, to varying
degrees, generally bolstered growth in the economies of the region.

It was during this period that the communities of Barksdale and Vance were first established. Settlers moved
into the area now known as Barksdale in the 1860s. Lewis Barksdale, who himself settled there in 1869,
owned much of the land that the community was built on. Originally, the community was called Dixie
because of the proximity to Camp Dixie. By the 1880s, residents decided to apply to have a post office. In
this process, they learned that another community already had the name Dixie, so the citizens renamed the
community Barksdale. The town grew slowly, but enough to add a school, church, and general stores. At
the turn of the century, a gristmill and a cotton gin were built, followed by telephone lines and a bank. By
the 1940s, Barksdale had a school, a church, and five businesses. The population started to decline in the
1950s, although the period also saw the town construct a second church and a high school in the 1970s.
Development in the 1980s, allowed the community to grow as several subdivisions were added (Odintz
2016).
In the early 1870s, Henry Wells settled near the confluence of the Nueces River and Bullhead Creek, just
south of Bullhead Mountain. He was followed by others and they named their community Bullhead. A
cemetery was established in 1875 when a man visiting Wells died and was buried on the family’s land. In
the early 1900s, Rancher Z. H. Pannell donated nearby land for the cemetery and a church, which was
constructed in 1917 (THC 1988). The town was renamed in the 1880s after Xavier Wanz, noted for having
pursued Indian raiders to recover stolen horses in the 1860s. His name was sometimes written Vance, and
that was adapted for the new town name. Prior to the name change, the community served as the Edwards
County seat until it was moved to Leakey. In 1913, parts of Edwards, Bandera, and Kerr Counties were
combined to create Real County. By that time, Vance was already in decline. The post office lasted until
1955 and by the 1980s, only the church, cemetery, and a few dwellings remained (Minton 2016).
Throughout the twentieth century, trade, transportation, and tourism continued to bring economic prosperity
to the region. The establishment of military facilities (e.g., Fort Hood and the activity surrounding World
War I and World War II kept the railway system active and commercial activity in the east prospered.
Through the remainder of the twentieth century, population in Central Texas increased largely due to
expansion and commercial opportunities in urban and rural areas. The construction of public highways and
automobiles facilitated the commuting of Central Texas citizens to urban employment.

BACKGROUND REVIEW AND SURVEY METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources records review to determine if the proposed APE has been previously
surveyed for cultural resources or if any archaeological sites have been recorded within or adjacent to the
APE. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed portions of the Vance and Camp Wood,
Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps on the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas).
These sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological
surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of NRHP properties, sites designated as
SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys. The review examined aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology Maps, and
the NRCS Web Soil Survey. SWCA archaeologists also examined the TxDOT Historic Overlay to identify
the presence of potential historic-age structures.
The background literature review determined that no cultural resources surveys have been conducted within
the proposed Project alignment; however, one archaeological site (41ED4) has been documented within the
proposed Project area (THC 2016). Additionally, eight archaeological sites (41ED19, 41ED20, 41ED162,
41ED163, and 41RE82–85), two cemeteries (Barksdale and Vance cemeteries), and five historical markers
(Marker numbers 662, 5401, 1233, 4841, and 5638) are within 1 mile of the Project area (Tables 1 and 2).

Site 41ED4 is located in Edward County along RR 335, roughly 5 miles north of Barksdale, Texas. No
information is available, other than location, for this site on the Atlas (THC 2016). Sites 41ED19 and
41ED20 are situated about 0.6 mile east of RR 335 and less than 1 mile north of Barksdale, overlooking
the Nueces River. No information is available, other than location, for either of these sites on the Atlas
(THC 2016). Sites 41ED162 and 41ED163 are located west of RR 335 about 0.5 and 0.8 mile, respectively,
and about 3.75 miles north of Barksdale. These sites are situated on uplands overlooking the valley to the
east. Both of these sites were initially identified in 1934 by W. Vane Huskey and subsequently assigned
trinomials in 1999. Site 41ED162 is recorded as a prehistoric site with eight burned rock middens, while
site 41ED163 is identified as a prehistoric campsite. No recommendations, other than verification of their
exact location, were made.
In Real County, across the Nueces River, are sites 41RE82–41RE85. No information is available, other
than location, for sites 41RE82, 41ED83, and 41ED85 on the Atlas (THC 2016). Site 41RE82 is located
south of Barksdale, about 0.8 mile from the Project area. Site 41RE83 is located over 1 mile north of
Barksdale and about 0.75 mile east of the Project area and positioned adjacent to Dry Creek. Site 41RE85
is located about 0.25 mile east of the Project area and 0.25 mile south of Vance, Texas. Site 41RE84 is
located north of Vance and roughly 0.5 mile away from the Project area, along Bullhead Creek. This site
was initially identified in 1934 by W. Vane Huskey and subsequently assigned a trinomial in 1999. Site
41RE84 is recorded as a prehistoric site with 11 burned rock middens and no recommendation, other than
verification of the exact site location, was made. Finally, 41RE86 is a large prehistoric site located within
Vance about 160 feet west of the current Project area. This site was initially identified in 1934 by W. Vane
Huskey and subsequently assigned a trinomial in 1999. Site 41RE86 is recorded as a prehistoric site with
two burned rock middens; no recommendations, other than verification of the exact site location, was made.
The background review determined that two cemeteries are near the proposed Project. The Old Barksdale
Cemetery (ED-C009) is in Barksdale, about 0.3 mile west of the Project alignment. The cemetery is
recorded as containing 1,104 interments that date from the late 1800s to the present. The second cemetery
(RE-C013) is in Vance, about 150 feet west of the Project. This cemetery is recorded as containing 550
interments that date from the late 1800s to the present. Neither cemetery will be affected by the proposed
Project.

The background review determined that five historical markers (Marker numbers 662, 5401, 1233, 4841,
and 5638) are near the Project area (Table 2). One marker (5638) commemorates the aforementioned Vance
Cemetery and was erected in 1988. The second marker (662) is located about 0.8 mile north of Barksdale
and 0.1 mile west of the Project area. This marker commemorates the historic Camp Fawcett, a Boy Scout

camp opened in 1930 and named for Erasmus Keyes (E. K.) Fawcett; it was erected in 1967. The remaining
three markers are located within Barksdale and commemorate the Pioneer Coalsons (5401), the Nix Mill
(4841), and the Dixie Settlement (1233). The Pioneer Coalson’s marker, erected in 1972, details the hard
lives of Nick Coalson and family who were early settlers in the area. The Nix Mill marker details the mill
constructed by John L. Nix to process timber, grind corn and wheat, and gin cotton. The mill was powered
by steam and provided materials for the community in the late 1800s. Finally, the Dixie Settlement marker,
erected in 1974, commemorates Camp Dixie, a Texas Ranger post in the 1800s, which saw civilian
settlement and was eventually renamed to present day Barksdale in 1882.

Description

Camp Fawcett (662)

Boy Scout Camp opened in 1930 and named after E.K. Fawcett, the President of the
Southwest Texas Council, Boy Scouts of America.

Dixie Settlement (1233)

Named for Camp Dixie, a Texas Ranger post. First settler was Jerusha Sanchez who was
widowed by Native Americans in the 1870s and expanded into a community from there.

Nix Mill (4841)

Built by John L. Nix (1842-1915) to cut rawhide lumber, grind corn and white, and gin cotton.

Coalsons, The Pioneer (5401)

Site where Native Americans attacked a goat camp of Nick Coalson on June 1, 1877; son
Arthur, 10, was killed; Johnny, 14, wounded. Coalson escaped after 3 hours of hard fighting.
The Coalson descendants are prominent in Texas History

Vance Cemetery (5638)

One of the earliest settlers of this area was Henry Wells (1850–1923), who first came to the
Nueces Canyon in 1866. He founded the town of Bullhead in 1873. The name was changed
to Vance in the mid-1880s. In 1875 a guest in the home of the Wells Family, C. J. Fowler,
died and was buried on the family's farm. The land surrounding Fowler's grave became
known as Vance Cemetery. Much of the community is buried there.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
SWCA conducted a review of historic maps, including the 1896 Nueces, Texas USGS 30-minute
topographic quadrangle map, 1944 Barksdale, Texas and Hackberry, Texas USGS 15-minute topographic
quadrangle maps, and 1973 Camp Wood, Texas and Vance, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps (Foster et al. 2006). The review of these maps revealed 200 potential historic-age
structures illustrated on maps between 1896 and 1973. Most of these structures are located within Barksdale
or Vance, with only 14 near or adjacent to, but not within, the proposed Project. Of these 14 structures,
seven are located in Barksdale, with two of them illustrated on the 1896 Nueces map and five of them
illustrated on the 1944 Barksdale map. Six structures are located in Vance, and are all illustrated on the
1944 Hackberry map. The remaining structure is located along RR 335, roughly 0.7 mile south of Vance,
near the Nueces River. This structure is illustrated on the 1944 Hackberry map. These structures are all
located outside of the direct APE, but are potentially within the indirect APE and as such, were assessed by
an architectural historian. A discussion of the historic standing structures is presented below.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY FIELD METHODS
SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the entire Project area on public lands along the
STTC Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project. The investigations were of sufficient intensity to determine the
nature, extent, and SAL and NRHP eligibility of all cultural resources located within the proposed Project
area. The THC’s minimum survey standards, require 16 shovel tests per mile, per 100 feet of corridor width
with thorough documentation of all exceptions (e.g., disturbance, slope, and impervious surfaces). Based
on these standards, the STTC Project area required 120 shovel tests; however, due to heavy road
construction disturbance (e.g., road cuts, man-made ditches, buried utilities, and levees) SWCA conducted
shovel tests along the areas of low to moderate disturbance and thoroughly documented areas of high
disturbance. The areas of low to moderate disturbance constituted approximately 2.2 miles of the total

16

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

survey area, requiring approximately 36 shovel tests. SWCA exceeded this number with the excavation of
49 shovel tests.
The field survey consisted of a team of SWCA archaeologists systematically walking the entire proposed
Project area on public lands and examining the ground surface and erosional profiles for cultural resources.
The utilization of subsurface exploration (i.e., shovel testing) was keyed to the level of disturbance and the
nature of the soils, geology, and topography.
Shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and were excavated in arbitrary 20­
cm levels to 1 meter (m) in depth, unless soil characteristics or bedrock precluded reaching that depth. The
matrix from each shovel test was screened through ¼-inch mesh, and the location of each excavation was
plotted using a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Each shovel test was recorded on a
standardized form to document the excavations. Archaeologists conducted one survey transect along the
western side of the RR 335 where either cable or pole installation will occur.
All archaeological sites encountered within the proposed Project were explored as much as possible with
consideration to land access constraints in order to make recommendations for proper resource management
(i.e., avoidance, non-avoidance, or further work). Additional shovel tests were excavated as appropriate
based on field conditions in accordance with THC standards at all sites to define horizontal and vertical
boundaries. SWCA completed appropriate State of Texas Archaeological Site Data Forms for each site
discovered during the investigations. A detailed plan map of each site was produced and locations were
mapped with a Trimble GPS unit and plotted on USGS 7.5-minute topographic maps and relevant Project
maps. SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. When discovered, artifacts were documented through
notes and photographs in the field and then left in place.

HISTORIC RESOURCES VIEWSHED SURVEY
SWCA conducted a historic resource viewshed survey to identify, document, and evaluate historic
resources and their associated viewsheds along the transmission line that may be affected by the Project.
All resources were evaluated according to criteria established for the NRHP. The survey was conducted in
compliance with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Preservation Planning, Identification,
and Evaluation and the NHPA, 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800. A qualified architectural
historian that meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications Guidelines (36 CFR 61)
assessed the aboveground cultural resources within the Project.
VIEWSHED SURVEY METHODS
SWCA documented historic buildings or structures and related sites in and/or adjacent to the Project area.
Crews assessed possible impacts in the proposed Project APE, including both the direct APE where
construction impacts will occur and the Project viewshed (indirect APE for Visual Impacts). The extent of
the indirect APE typically includes a 164-foot (50-m) buffer surrounding the proposed Project area. An
analysis of indirect Project impacts was limited to those portions of the Project that will result in an
alteration to the visual landscape (i.e., the construction of a tall structure such as a transmission tower).
Given that a majority of the proposed transmission line parallels existing elevated structures, the Project
view shed has been previously affected.
SWCA photographed structures within the Project viewshed, to the extent possible, from ROWs of public
roadways. These photographs were examined by the architectural historian to determine significance. If a
resource was assessed as potentially significant or significant, historians conducted archival investigations
to attempt to determine whether the resource was associated with a person or event of local, regional, or
state significance (Criteria A and B of the NRHP). Resources determined eligible for the NRHP were

17

Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

documented according to the THC Historic Preservation Resource Identification system using appropriate
forms and photography protocols. The location of each structure was plotted on a USGS (or similar) map
using sub-meter accuracy GPS units (land access allowing). Photographs for non-eligible structures were
provided, along with basic data such as location and estimated date of construction, but detailed inventory
forms were not completed.

NRHP CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION
The quality of significance in American archaeology, architecture, and history is present in sites, districts,
buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association, and meet the following criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]):
A. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history;
B. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
NRHP CRITERIA CONSIDERATIONS
Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions
or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed
historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved
significance within the past 50 years should not be considered eligible for the NRHP. However, such
properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the
following categories:
a) A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or
historical importance;
b) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is primarily significant for
architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic
person or event;
c) A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site
or building directly associated with his or her productive life;
d) A cemetery which derives its primary importance from graves of person of transcendent
importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events;

SWCA Environmental Consultants
SWCA Project No. 40085-AUS

18

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

e) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a
dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with
the same association has survived;
f) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has
invested it with its own exceptional significance; or
g) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.

FIELD SURVEY RESULTS
On October 5–6, 2016, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed
7.5-mile-long Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project with surface and subsurface investigations as necessary,
based on field conditions (Appendix A). From southwest to northeast, the fiber optic line begins on both
sides of State Highway (SH) 55, within the cities of Barksdale, and runs north for approximately 160 m,
until the APE combines on the east side of the road. The APE follows the east side of SH 55 and then
RR 335 for approximately 380 m where it then crosses the road to the west side, following the west side of
RR 335 for the remainder of the Project area (approximately 7.15 miles).
Visual examination revealed the APE has been extensively impacted by artificial and natural disturbances.
In many cases the TxDOT roadway has cut into the upland landscape by use of explosives and excavators,
while other areas have been elevated with imported fill up to 30 feet above the natural ground surface
(Figures 5 and 6). Maintenance of the existing ROW, involving mowing and burning, has hastened erosion,
due to the lack of native vegetation. Archaeologists also noted overhead power lines, buried telephone
cables, and gravel driveways within and adjacent to the existing ROW throughout the direct APE (Figure 7).
Such disturbances have significantly altered the natural landscape and negatively impacted the integrity of
all cultural resources encountered within the APE.
The survey area along the west side of RR 335 is characterized by rolling uplands (Appendix A, A.1–A.4).
The APE primarily spans erosional, ephemeral drainages with limited, shallow alluvial deposits that extend
to a maximum depth of approximately 20 cm below surface (cmbs) (Appendix B). Towards the city of
Vance, the APE crosses a broad channel of the Nueces River, which was composed of moderate alluvial
and gravel deposits to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs. The paved RR 335 is frequently built above grade on
imported fill or cut below grade into the limestone bedrock (Figures 8 and 9). Investigators encountered
disturbed fill, shallow gravelly soils, and prevalent exposures of limestone bedrock throughout the APE.
The Nueces River crossing has been heavily modified by buried utilities and concrete raised road serving
as a low water crossing.
Subsurface examination involved the excavation of 49 shovel tests, of which only one contained possible
cultural remains. SWCA revisited one previously recorded site (41ED4) and newly documented two
prehistoric sites (41ED283 and 41ED284) within the APE. In addition, 19 standing structures were
identified as part of the historic resources viewshed survey. Previously documented site 41ED4 is mapped
within the APE on a terrace of the Nueces; however, no evidence of the site was found within the APE.
Newly recorded sites 41ED283 and 41ED284 were documented on a riverine terrace of the Nueces River
where soil deposition was present within the APE.

SITE 41ED4
Site 41ED4 is a previously documented site located roughly 5 miles north of Barksdale. The Atlas does not
provide any further information about the site other than the site boundary (Figure 10; THC 2016). The site
is situated on a riverine terrace overlooking the Nueces River and is bisected by the current APE. The APE
crosses the site on the western road easement of RR 335 at the fence line of a private property. The site area
is currently being utilized as an exotic game ranch on either side of RR 335, with an existing buried utility
located on the west side of the APE within the site boundary.
Initial pedestrian inspection revealed exposed portions of limestone bedrock along the road ditch in the site
area (Figure 11). Archaeologists excavated a total of seven shovel tests at 50-m intervals within the APE in
the vicinity of the previously recorded site boundary, with four shovel tests excavated within the site
boundary. All shovel tests were negative for cultural materials and typically revealed shallow gravelly silt
loam to bedrock at approximately 2 to 15 cmbs. The surface and subsurface investigations did not find any
evidence of the site within the current APE.
SUMMARY
Site 41ED4 is a site of unknown temporal association and type bisected from north-to-south by the current
APE. SWCA conducted a thorough surface inspection and seven subsurface tests within or near the defined
site boundary; however, no cultural materials were encountered within the portion of the previously
recorded site boundary within the APE. As no actual evidence of the site was encountered within the Project
area, no avoidance or further work is recommended for the portion of site 41ED4 within the current APE.

SITE 41ED283
Site 41ED283 is a prehistoric site consisting of multiple thermal features on the edge of an old riverine
terrace that has been previously disturbed by the construction of RR 335 (Figures 12 and 13). Directly east
of the terrace is an old bend of the Nueces River that is covered in numerous old Pecan trees, with the
current Nueces River located approximately 65 m southeast of the site. The terrace has been cleared to
make a semi-wooded pasture with a gravel and dirt driveway directly southwest of the site boundary.
Vegetation within the site area includes short, manicured grasses with tall grasses and old pecan and cedar
trees observed to the west, on top of the terrace.
Surface inspections at the site identified five burned rock features (P1–P5) and a diffuse scatter of surface
artifacts, which all seem to be eroding down to the APE from the terrace to the west. All of the features are
deflated and have been disturbed by either erosion or mechanical means, (e.g., road construction and
mowing). The features likely represent multiple thermal features (P1–P4) and one burned rock midden (P5).
The features appear to be concentrated on the edge of the terrace, with only eroding burned rock and a few
lithic artifacts observed on the surface within the APE.
Feature P1 consists of remnants of a thermal feature measuring 12 m north-to-south by 15–20 m west-to­
east. The majority of the feature is within the private property to the west of the APE (Figure 14). The
feature is composed of large- (>15 cm) to small-sized (5–10 cm) burned rock. One lithic core with isolated
platforms and one dark gray tertiary flake were observed in the feature area within the APE.

Feature P2 is a deflated thermal feature on the western edge of the APE. The feature measures
approximately 8 m north-to-south by 3 m west-to-east. The feature consists of mostly small- and mediumsized (10–15 cm) burned rocks and a single lithic expedient tool (Figure 15).
Feature P3 is located along the western edge of the APE approximately 12 m southwest of P2. The feature
measures 8 m north-to-south by 8 m west-to-east and consists of an even distribution of small- and mediumsized burned rocks with no associated lithic artifacts (Figure 16). Feature P3 seems to have a remnant base
of a feature eroding out of the slope, suggesting there may be buried components to the west and outside of
the APE.
Feature P4 is identified just west of the APE on private property and measures approximately 5 m northto-south by 8 m west-to-east (Figure 17). The feature is a tight cluster of burned rock with mostly smalland some medium-sized burned rocks, but no visible associated lithic artifacts. Most of the feature appears
to be eroding down the slope from the surface of the terrace; however, a tight cluster of small rocks on the
slope indicates intact portions of the feature may be extant outside the current APE.
Feature P5, a deflated burned rock midden, measures approximately 30 m north-to-south by 20 m west-to­
east with a combination of large, medium-, and small-sized burned rock eroding down into the APE (Figure
18). The feature is mostly within the private property to the west of the APE under an old pecan tree. The
feature consists of three or more concentrations of burned rock eroding into one large deflated burned rock
midden and contains three expedient scrapers including one made from a prepared platform core flake
(Figure 19).
SWCA conducted seven shovel tests along the APE along the edge of the site, all of which were negative
for subsurface cultural material. The soils on the site consisted of a disturbed gravelly silt loam to a
calcareous clay loam or degrading bedrock at approximately 20 to 30 cmbs. Modern tire rubber fragments
and plastic were observed from 0 to 30 cmbs.

SUMMARY
Site 41ED283 is a prehistoric site consisting of multiple thermal features eroding off a riverine terrace
overlooking an old bend of the Nueces River. The portion of the site within the APE is a surficial scatter of
burned rock and lithic tools and has been subjected to heavy disturbance from road construction and road
easement maintenance. The site extends further to the west onto private property and may have a buried
component in the terrace landform outside the current APE. SWCA recommends that the portion of site
41ED283 within the Project area is not eligible for designation as an SAL or for the NRHP and no further
work is warranted with regard to this portion of site 41ED283. The site appears to extend farther to the west
beyond the current APE, and those portions of the site outside of the Project area were not evaluated during
this current survey effort. In the event of future impacts to the unevaluated portions of the site, SWCA
recommends further work to reassess NRHP eligibility.

SITE 41ED284
Site 41ED284 consists of a single thermal feature on an old riverine terrace at the base of a steep rocky
terrace slope to the northwest (Figures 20 and 21). The site is situated on the western road easement of
RR 335 at the fence line of a private property. To the west is an old bend of the Nueces River covered in
Pecan trees, with the current channel of the Nueces River located approximately 370 m to the southeast.
The site is positioned within the heavily disturbed and ditched ROW of RR 335. The site area is covered
by young oak and juniper trees with limited grass cover on the private property to the west of the APE;
short manicured grasses are present in the APE along the RR 335 easement.
Surface inspections at the site identified a single burned rock feature (P1) and a surficial scatter of burned
rock measuring approximately 23 m north-to-south and 5 m west-to-east. No burned rock was observed on
the west side of the fence outside the APE. Feature P1 appears is a burned rock feature, which may be the
deflated and disturbed remnants of three or more heating events (Figure 22). A dense cluster of small- sized
burned rocks, approximately 2 m in diameter, was visible on the surface, due to vegetation clearing from
red harvester ants. The soil around the feature is dark and organic-rich with a north-to-south scattering of
burned rock measuring approximately 23 m in diameter. Burned rocks were not observed to the west of the
APE beyond the fence line, where ground surface visibility was much higher; therefore, the site appears to
be located entirely within the APE. The presence of young trees may indicate that the previous growth was
burned along the fence line, possibly adding modern burned rock to the size of the overall site. However,
the presence of the lithic flakes and the tightly clustered feature of burned rock suggests there is a prehistoric
component to the site. Archaeologists found two lithic tools (an expedient tool and a chopper) on the surface
within the Feature P1 area, as well as a single burned tertiary chert flake (Figure 23).
SWCA excavated six shovel tests within the APE in and around the site area (Appendix B). Of the six
shovel tests, only one contained possible subsurface cultural deposits (ST 31). Shovel tests encountered
highly disturbed soils within the road ditch consisting of a disturbed gravelly silt loam overlying a
calcareous clay loam or degrading bedrock at approximately 20 cmbs. Modern tire rubber fragments and
plastic were present from 0 to 20 cmbs. The positive shovel test was placed within 5 m of Feature P1 and
encountered a 2-cm thick lens of burned organics on top of bedrock at 20 cmbs. The lens could be a remnant
of burned organics from a cooking feature, or the burned materials may be a result of modern burning for
vegetation clearing. Given the extensive disturbances in the site area, the latter is much more likely.

SUMMARY
Site 41ED284 consists of a single burned rock feature located in the western road easement of RR 335
overlooking an old bend of the Nueces River. The site appears to be entirely within the APE and is a surficial
scatter of burned rock with an expedient lithic tool and a burned tertiary flake. Shovel testing encountered
no buried cultural deposits, aside from a lens of charred organics that are likely related to modern burning
activities. The entire site has been subjected to continual disturbance from road construction, land clearing,
and road easement maintenance. Given these data, SWCA recommends that site 41ED284 is not eligible
for designation as an SAL or for the NRHP and no further work is warranted.

STANDING STRUCTURES
SWCA archaeologists photographed 19 possible historic-age structures adjacent to the Project area for
desktop review by the SWCA architectural historian. The majority of the structures (n=13) recorded are
homes, with two commercial buildings, two storage buildings, and a church, making up the rest of the
buildings (Table 3; Appendix C). Most of the structures (n=13) are located on the southern end of the
Project area in or near Barksdale, with the remaining six structures noted on the northern end in Vance. The
estimated date of construction for the structures ranges from ca. 1910–1960, with only one structure
identified with a known date of construction: 1917 for the Vance Baptist Church.
Of the 19 structures, only one, the Vance Baptist Church, associated with the adjacent 1875 Vance
Cemetery, appears potentially eligible for the NRHP (Figures 24 and 25). The 1917 Vance Baptist Church
is typical of rural, Vernacular style church. It is a one-story building with a steep, corrugated metal, frontgable roof with a cupola bell tower and an upper vent in the gable end. The foundation is likely pier and
beam, but has been in-filled with concrete. Asbestos shingle siding, likely a 1940s alteration, covers the
exterior. The main entry is a set of wooden double doors sheltered by an attached gable roof supported by

metal posts. Instead of steps, which would have been typical for the entry, there is a wheelchair accessible
ramp with metal rails. The windows appear to be metal, 2/2 units, most likely replacements done in the
1940s, along with the siding. Even with alterations, Vance Baptist Church embodies the distinctive
characteristics of a rural, Vernacular church. The adjacent Vance Cemetery has the graves of the earliest
settlers of Vance, including large land owners who donated land for the cemetery and church. The
association with these locally significant people and the importance they placed on establishing a
community cemetery and place of worship add to the site’s potential NRHP eligibility.
As the Project is currently configured, there should be no direct effect on the potential NRHP-eligible
resource, nor will the addition of aboveground poles adversely affect the viewshed, as elevated utility lines
are already present in the area. It is recommended that the Project avoid any direct impacts to the structure
and adjacent cemetery.

Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of STTC, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the RR 335 Fiber Optic
Cable Extension Project in Edwards and Real Counties, Texas. The Project involves the installation of
approximately 7.5 miles of fiber optic telecommunication cable for STTC. The cable will be installed within
the ROW of RR 335 in southeastern Edwards County, Texas, with portions being overhead (±2.2 miles)
and the remaining ±5.3 miles being installed underground via trenching. Overall, the Project’s APE is
approximately 7.5 miles long, 20 feet wide, and 4 to 5 feet in depth, encompassing about 18 acres. In
locations where the buried utility will be horizontally directional drilled (e.g., roads and drainages), impacts
may extend to a depth of approximately 10 feet.
As the proposed Project occurs on land owned by TxDOT, a political subdivision of the state, the work was
performed in compliance with the ACT under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7797. The investigations
included a cultural resources background review, an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey with shovel
testing, and a review of standing structures within and immediately adjacent to the APE. The background
literature review determined that no cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the APE;
however, one archaeological site (41ED4) has been documented within the proposed Project area. The
review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed no known historic-age structures within the current
Project area, but 14 structures were potentially located adjacent to the APE.
The intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the APE is within an eroded upland environment with a lack
of Holocene deposition; shallow limestone bedrock; and prevalent disturbance related to roadway
construction and maintenance, existing utilities, and erosion. The THC’s survey standards require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear surveys with a corridor width of less than 100 feet, in areas
with less than 30 percent surface visibility and less than a 20 percent slope. Considering the 20-foot-wide
survey corridor, high ground surface visibility, heavy road construction disturbances, and rocky slopes
encountered within the APE, the 49 shovel tests excavated within the 7.5 miles of the direct APE exceeds
the THC’s survey standards.
SWCA revisited one previously recorded site location (41ED4) and newly recorded two archaeological
sites (sites 41ED283 and 41ED284) within the APE. SWCA archaeologists were unable to locate previously
recorded site 41ED4 within the APE; it appears that the site is either destroyed or located beyond the Project
area. Site 41ED283 is a prehistoric site consisting of five eroded burned rock features and a diffuse surficial
lithic scatter, while site 41ED284 is a prehistoric site with a single eroded burned rock feature and a few
surficial lithic artifacts. Due to the lack of soil deposition, absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts and
intact cultural features, and ubiquity of the site type in the region, the portions of sites 41ED283 and
41ED284 within the APE have limited potential to yield new or important information regarding regional
prehistory. Based on these findings, SWCA recommends that the portions of sites 41ED283 and 41ED284
within the APE are not eligible for designation as an SAL or for the NRHP; no further investigations are
warranted within the current APE for these two sites. Should the APE change and necessitate impacts to
other portions of the sites, SWCA recommends further pedestrian archaeological survey with shovel testing
to document the extent of the sites outside the current APE.
The cultural resources investigations also included an assessment of the indirect APE for aboveground
resources within 164 feet (50 m) of the direct APE. Nineteen standing structures were noted within the
indirect APE, of which only one, the 1917 Vance Baptist Church, associated with the adjacent 1875 Vance
Cemetery, appears potentially eligible for the NRHP. Based on the current Project design plans, there
should be no direct effect on the viewshed of this potential NRHP-eligible resource, because elevated utility
lines are already present. It is recommended that the Project continue to avoid direct impacts to the structure
and adjacent cemetery.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
Texas Ranch Road 335 Fiber Optic Cable Extension Project

In accordance with 33 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources within the Project area. No properties were identified within the direct APE that may meet the
criteria for the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL, as per 13 TAC 26.10.
Therefore, SWCA recommends that no additional cultural resources investigations should be warranted
within the Project area, as currently defined. Site 41ED283 appears to extend farther to the west beyond the
proposed APE and portions of the site outside of the Project area have not been evaluated. In the event of
future impacts to the unevaluated portions of this site, SWCA recommends further work to assess the SAL
eligibility of site 41ED283, as per 13 TAC 26.12.
