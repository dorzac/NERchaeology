ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey was performed in compartments 44 and 48 of
the Angelina National Forest by archaeologists representing Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) and Dixie Environmental Services Company, LP.
(DESCO) in June of 2008 under an Archaeological Resource Protection Act
(ARPA) permit. Two separate areas totaling 1,369.6 acres were examined. The
areas were investigated through a visual inspection accompanied by shovel
testing at source points and along access routes. One area containing trash that
had been dumped along an abandoned logging road was observed. This area is
referred to in this report as Locality 1. The trash scatter is not considered to be
significant. Therefore, it is recommended that the seismic survey be allowed to
proceed as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the
National Forests and Grasslands in Texas, DESCO, and BVRA. The project
notes and other records have been placed in permanent curation at the
Supervisors Office of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Frontline GeoServices plans to conduct a 3-D seismic survey in the
Angelina National Forest in Angelina County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area
is depicted on two USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. They are Manning
(3194-214) (Figure 2) and Zavalla (3194-123) (Figure 3). The purpose of the
seismic survey is to provide a high-resolution image of the subsurface geological
features that will allow the client to effectively evaluate the hydrocarbon reserves
underlying the project area. This survey requires the deployment of motion
sensing devices (receivers) that will be deployed at regular intervals (165 feet)
with spacing between receiver lines of 1650 feet. An energy source (Pentolite)
will be placed at regular intervals (233.35 feet) in a diagonal pattern. The charge
depth and configuration proposed for the project area consists of single holes (80
to 100 feet deep) drilled at intervals of 1815 feet along each source line.
The seismic survey will be conducted by several crews marking the
proposed sites for source holes and locations of geophones. They will use GPS,
inertial, and/or conventional surveying methods, and hand-clearing of vegetation
will be necessary along source and receiver lines within some portions of the
project area. Clearing of vegetation may be necessary in some areas to obtain
line-of-sight for conventional surveying and/or to allow for the safe passage of
crews along seismic lines. Brush, small trees, and branches will be cut through
the use of chainsaws and/or machetes.
Drilling will begin shortly after the survey has been completed. It will be
accomplished using highland drilling rigs. During this phase of operations, drills
will maneuver through the project area from source point to source point
following the route of least resistance. No mechanized clearing will be conducted
ahead of the drilling equipment. Some small trees and shrubs may be impacted
by the path of the drills.
One hole will be drilled at each source point location, loaded with the
appropriate charge, and plugged. The diameter of a drilled hole will be about
four inches. Each hole will be loaded with a 5.5-pound charge of Pentolite, and
the hole will be plugged with bentonite for the prevention of commingling of
surface and ground water.
Drilling will be followed by recording operations, which are tentatively
scheduled to begin in July of 2008. This task will be supported by helicopter to
minimize impacts to the terrain. The helicopters will lower cache bags containing
equipment along the receiver lines, and crews will deploy this equipment using
All Terrain Vehicles, where permitted, or on foot. Equipment will consist of data
recording boxes, geophones, and cables. Once enough equipment is laid out to
complete a recording patch, the recording crew will begin detonating charges.

1

The charge in each source hole will be remotely detonated, one at a time,
and the resulting energy wave recorded. Crewmembers will travel through the
area, hook a shooting pack to each electronic detonating wire (cap), and
detonate each charge.
Clean up will be conducted in conjunction with all phases of operations.
After charges are detonated and recording is completed in each swath (area
between two receiver lines), all equipment, trash, and flagging will be completely
removed from the area and placed in cached bags for removal by helicopter.
Equipment removed from lines in the west section of the recording patch will be
deployed along lines east of the recording patch to allow recording operations to
continue in that direction. Project impacts are expected to be minimal and
temporary in nature.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion was taken from the Soil Survey of
Angelina County (Dolezel 1988:1-4). Angelina County is located in the central
part of East Texas. The northern and southern parts of the county have a
dendritic drainage system with many large streams. Two rivers, Neches and
Angelina, drain the county. In Area A, there are two unnamed tributaries that
connect with Shawnee Creek to the south. In the county, elevation ranges from
about 100 feet in the south near the Neches River to about 460 feet in the
northern part of the county. Angelina County is in the East Texas Timberlands
Land Resource Area, and forest products are a major part of the local economy.
Soils in this area formed mainly under forest vegetation in a humid environment,
and most are light in color and low in natural fertility. Nearly level areas are often
wet, and moderately steep-to-steep areas tend to erode easily. The county has
long, hot summers because of moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico
persistently covers the area. Winters are cool and fairly short. Rainfall is fairly
heavy throughout the year, and prolonged droughts are rare. The total annual
precipitation is 41 inches. Of this, 21 inches (50%) usually falls in April through
September. In winter, the average temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the average daily minimum temperature is 39 degrees. In summer, the average
temperature is 82 degrees, and the average daily maximum temperature is 93
degrees.
According to the soil survey for Angelina County (Dolezel 1988:Sheets 24
and 30), Area A contains six soil types. These are Alazan very fine sandy loam,
0 to 4 percent slopes (AaB); Bernaldo fine sandy loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes
(BaB); Fuller fine sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes (FfB); Herty very fine sandy
loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (HeB); Keltys fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes
(KcB); and Moswell loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (MsB). The majority of the
project area contains AaB and BaB soils, and these are discussed below. Figure
4 depicts the soils in Area A.
AaB soils are found on terraces and low uplands. This soil is described by
Dolezel (1988:23-24) as a soil formed in sediment partly reworked by wind. This
soil has a very fine sandy loam surface layer about 16 inches thick. The subsoil,
to a depth of 72 inches, is a sandy clay loam. AaB soils have a high available
water capacity, are moderately permeable, are somewhat poorly drained, and
runoff is slow to medium. This soil is saturated in late winter and early spring.
The water table is found at a depth of 18 to 30 inches.

BaB soils are found on broad, nearly level, and gently sloping terraces
near all major streams. This soil is described by Dolezel (1988:26) as a soil that
formed in old wind-modified sediment. Some areas have low mounds, especially
those in virgin areas. This soil has a very fine sandy loam surface layer about 17
inches thick. The subsoil, to a depth of 65 inches, is a sandy clay loam. BaB
soils have a high available water capacity, are moderately permeable, are well
drained, and runoff is slow. This soil is saturated in at a depth of four to six feet
in late winter and early spring.
According to the soil survey for Angelina County (Dolezel 1988:Sheet 30),
Area B contains three soil types. These are Alazan very fine sandy loam, 0 to 4
percent slopes (AaB); Herty very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (HeB);
and Moswell loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (MsB). The majority of the project area
contains AaB and MsB soils, and these are discussed below. Figure 5 depicts
the soils in Area B.
AaB soils are found on terraces and low uplands. This soil is described by
Dolezel (1988:23-24) as a soil formed in sediment partly reworked by wind. This
soil has a very fine sandy loam surface layer about 16 inches thick. The subsoil,
to a depth of 72 inches, is a sandy clay loam. AaB soils have a high available
water capacity, are moderately permeable, are somewhat poorly drained, and
runoff is slow to medium. This soil is saturated in late winter and early spring.
The water table is found at a depth of 18 to 30 inches.
MsB soils are found on gently sloping, broad interstream divides. This soils
developed in marine shales and clays. This soil is described by Dolezel
(1988:51-52) as containing a loam surface layer about five inches thick. The
subsoil is sticky and plastic clay to a depth of 37 inches and platy clay to a depth
of 45 inches. The underlying material, to a depth of about 70 inches, is shale.
Gypsum and other salts are found in this soil below a depth of 23 inches. MsB
soils have a medium available water capacity, are very slowly permeable,
moderately well drained, and water erosion is a major hazard.
At the time of this survey the project area consisted of woods and a few
cleared areas. Much of the area had been disturbed by past lumbering activities.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern
Planning Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Angelina
County is situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In
1985, according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:107), Angelina County contained 52 recorded
sites. The site files at TARL revealed 172 recorded sites at the time of this
survey. In 1985, 1 site in the county had been excavated, 21 had been tested by
hand, 1 had been tested by machine, 30 sites had been dug by collectors, and
46 had been surface collected. Nine recorded prehistoric sites in the county
were listed as Archaic, and 41 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et
al. 1985:108). Five sites contained burials.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast
Texas Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this
time, Angelina County contained 121 recorded prehistoric sites. Of this number,
19 were listed as not significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably
significant, and 22 as significant. Today, the number of sites in the county
exceeds 190.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in
the following statistics. In 1993, the county contained the second highest number
of important known hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.3.3) and also contained at least 13 important Late
Caddoan sites (n=13) (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately,
there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological
sites in Angelina County. These include population growth (City of Lufkin and
surrounding area), highway construction, surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn
Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of
the archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified
by surveys associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by
National Forest personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was
performed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University
of Texas at Austin. At that time, prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were
considered to be of primary importance. From the late 1940s until the mid
1970s, most of the archaeological research in East Texas was carried out in
connection with reservoir construction. In 1948, Robert L. Stephenson published
the results of his work at the proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a,
1948b). At the time, this was the only professional archaeological investigation in
the county.

11

In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural
resources of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine national
forests of Texas. This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each
forest, and 23 sites in Angelina County are mentioned. Another important
document for this area is a cultural resource overview of the national forests in
Texas by John Ippolito (1983). Of particular relevance to this project is Ippolito's
Figure 21 entitled "Drainage Systems & Probability Zones, Angelina National
Forest, Texas."
Although no part of the project area is within the Angelina National Forest,
Ippolito's figure covers areas within 10 miles of the City of Lufkin. He considers
the Neches and Angelina rivers to be high probability areas with several streams
in the county listed as medium probability areas. According to Ippolito (personal
communication), there are several drainages in the county such as Hurricane
Creek and Biloxi Creek that should be considered to be medium to high
probability areas. Ephemeral streams, such as those in the current project area,
are viewed by Ippolito as low probability areas.
A check of the Archeological Sites Atlas revealed one previous survey in
the vicinity of the current project area. This small area survey was performed for
the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development. There is no
information on the Atlas that documents the size of the project area, name of
investigating firm, or date of survey. This area is approximately 452 meters
southwest of the current project area.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et
al. 1985), the planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and other reports cited above for more detailed information regarding the
archaeology of Angelina County. According to Barbara Williams, there has been
no activity in the project area. She also stated that no major surveys have been
conducted in the vicinity.

METHODS
This archaeological survey was carried out in June of 2008. The fieldwork
began on June 2, 2008 and was terminated on June 9, 2008. Shovel tests were
excavated at each proposed source point and at intervals of 37 meters along
access, except for those areas along old roads, trails, or disturbed fire lanes. All
excavated earth was screened using ¼ inch hardware cloth and recorded on a
“Log of Areas Investigated” that appears as Appendix I to this report. The survey
crew recorded shovel test data on a log that was turned in at the end of the day.
Each surveyor began the day with a new set of shovel test numbers. As a result,
every field shovel test log begins with shovel test number 1. The tests (or areas
investigated) were numbered consecutively in the left margin of each log. These
numbers correspond with those in the first column in the Log of Areas
Investigated (Area). If a source point was not tested, the phrase “no test”
appears in the sixth column (Shovel Test Depth). On the original shovel test logs
there is more information regarding soil types than is present in the Log of Areas
Investigated.
The project area consists of two separate tracts, which are described in
this report as Area A and Area B. Area A is a 1043.2-acre tract located in
Compartment 44 of the Angelina National Forest, and Area B is a 326.4-acre
tract located in Compartment 48 of the Angelina National Forest. The field
methods for each area were identical. Due to the thick ground cover, the surface
visibility was poor in most cases, and shovel testing was the only way to ensure
that no sites were missed. In all, 119 source points and their access routes were
investigated, and 363 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel tests varied in depth
from less than 10 cm to 100 cm. The locations of the 363 shovel tests are
depicted on two maps that appear in this report as Appendix II. The project was
also documented by field notes, logs, and digital photography.
Historic trash was observed in Area A, and it was given the field number
LS-01. The area was inspected through a surface inspection and nine shovel
tests. The crew looked for signs of a house such as domestic plants and
features. A map was made in the field, and the locality plotted on the topographic
map. Following a discussion with Barbara Williams, it was decided to refer to this
trash dump or scatter as Locality 1. Therefore, no site trinomial was assigned.
This trash scatter contains some artifacts that date to modern times and some
that may be older than 50 years. Since this locality is not considered to be
significant, no artifacts were collected for analysis. They were described in the
field. Figure 7 is a map that depicts the locality and the nine shovel tests, and
Figure 8 illustrates a portion of the dump. The shovel test log for this locality
appears in this report as Appendix III. These tests do not appear on the Log of
Areas Investigated.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed that no previously recorded sites are
present within any portion of the project area as currently defined. A review of
the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and historic sites are present in
nearby areas of Angelina County. One small concentrated trash scatter or dump
was recorded in Area A at source point 5144/1226. The trash was found
adjacent to an abandoned logging road, and it represents an unauthorized
dumping event on Forest Service property. This area is referred to in this report
as Locality 1, and it contains the remains of glass bottles and jars, a metal pail,
paint can, small aluminum coffee pot, stove burner parts, brown glass and clear
glass. These artifacts date to the 20th century. A visual search of the area did
not encounter any features or domestic plants that are typically found at a house
site. The nine shovel tests excavated in the area were dug through sand, sandy
loam, and sandy clay to a maximum depth of 40 cm. Only one test was positive.
A wire nail was recovered at 10 cm below the surface in Shovel Test 1. Trash
dumps are a common occurrence, and Locality 1 is not viewed as significant.

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
Only one area containing artifacts was found in the project area. The trash
scatter referred to as Locality 1 is not significant. Therefore, it is recommended
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that
archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey. Should
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered during
construction, all work in this area should cease immediately until the Texas
Historical Commission can evaluate the situation. This project was performed
according to the Minimum Survey Standards as defined by the THC.
