ABSTRACT
On behalf of Harris County, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) has conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed Turkey Creek Park Equestrian Trail. Harris County proposes to
construct an equestrian trail within Turkey Creek Park in northern Harris County. The proposed trail will
be 12 feet wide within a 20-foot-wide maintained corridor approximately 1.32 miles long. A 100-foot-wide
corridor was investigated to allow for minor adjustments to the alignment. Construction areas will also
include approximately 0.39 mile of access road and an approximately 2.5-acre staging area. Overall project
dimensions total approximately 23 acres. Depth of project impacts are expected to be 1 to 2 feet below
surface or less.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January
31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC]
470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. As the project area is owned by a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure
(Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8028.
The background review revealed no previously conducted cultural resources surveys within the proposed
project area. Additionally, no previously recorded cultural resources have been identified within the project
area.
During the investigation, a total of 34 shovel tests were excavated; all were negative for cultural materials.
One additional shovel test was attempted, but not excavated due to location on a heavily modified bank of
Turkey Creek. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural resources were identified. A collapsed, modern picnic
shelter was identified north of the centerline towards Cypress Creek.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
project area. No properties listed or otherwise eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark, were identified within the project area. Consequently, SWCA
recommends no further archaeological investigation and a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES
AFFECTED under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). Per requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas, project
documentation will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Harris County, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) has conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed Turkey Creek Park Equestrian Trail (âprojectâ). Harris County
proposes to construct an equestrian trail within Turkey Creek Park in northern Harris County.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January
31, 2007); and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC]
470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. As the project area is owned by a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure
(Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8028.
A background research and literature review was completed for the project and surrounding area.
Additionally, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the area of effect of
the project.
Todd L. Butler served as Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the project. The report was prepared
by Susan E. Butler. The field survey was completed by C. Wesley Mattox and Todd McLeod. Geographic
information systems (GIS) support was provided and report graphics were prepared by GIS Specialist
Colleen Kennedy. The report was edited by Lauri Logan.

Project Area Description
The proposed trail is located in Turkey Creek Park, south of Cypress Creek, west of Cypresswood Drive
and north of Broze Road. The trail is bounded on the west side by Turkey Creek. The project area is depicted
on the Maedan 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map.
The proposed trail will be 12 feet wide within a 20-foot-wide maintained corridor approximately 1.32 miles
long. A 100-foot-wide corridor will be investigated to allow for minor adjustments to the alignment.
Construction areas will also include approximately 0.39 mile of access road and an approximately 2.5-acre
staging area (âproject areaâ). Overall project dimensions total approximately 23 acres. Depth of project
impacts are expected to be 1 to 2 feet below surface or less.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Physiographic Region
The project area is located in northern Harris County on the edge of two ecotones, the coastal plains of the
Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies to the south, and the Flatwoods ecotone to the north (Griffith et al.
2007). The Northern Humid Coastal Prairies are gently sloping and relatively flat. Soils are typically wet
because of poor drainage that results from clay subsoils and low relief. The Flatwoods are acidic, clayey,
and generally wet.

Geology
Geologically, the project area is located on the Lissie Formation (Barnes 1982). The Pleistocene Lissie
formation contains clay, silt, sand, and a very minor amount of small siliceous gravels. It is locally
calcareous, with concretions of calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and iron-manganese oxides. The surface is
fairly flat and featureless except for numerous rounded shallow depressions and pimple mounds (Barnes
1982).

Houston-PALM
According to Abbottâs (2001) Houston PALM, a guide to archaeological potential related to
geomorphology in the Harris County area, the project area is located in Map Units 1 and 2. Briefly, Map
Unit 1 is characteristic of areas underlain by deep Holocene deposits that exhibit low to moderate surficial
disturbance (Abbott 2001:156). Surface survey with shovel testing and deep testing, if deep impacts are
anticipated, is recommended in Map Unit 1. Map Unit 2 is characterized by Holocene-age, alluvial, eolian,
or colluvial veneer deposits that exhibit low to moderate evidence of disturbance and rest on Pleistocene
landforms (Abbott 2001:156). Surface survey with shovel testing is recommended in Map Unit 2.

Soils
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (NRCS 2017), two
primary soil map units are within the project area. These include Atasco fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent
slopes (AtaC) and Texla silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (TelB). A very small portion of the project area
contains soil map unit Gessner fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, ponded (Ge). Abbott (2001:21-23)
notes that those soils that are rated have low to low-moderate geoarchaeological potential.

Flora and Fauna
The modern vegetation communities differ slightly from past biotic communities (Griffith et al. 2007).
Vegetation in the area once consisted of piney forests dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
intermixed with white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), willow oak (Quercus
phellos), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and hollies (Ilex spp.) (Griffith
et al. 2007:92). Pine wetlands included sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera).
Today, the Flatwoods ecological province is dominated by loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus
echinata) pine plantations.

The project area is located in the southern Austroriparian biotic as defined by Blair (1950). The western
border of the Austroriparian biotic province is largely based on the expansion of the pine and hardwood
forest. As such, the expansion of this timber and the Austroriparian province fluctuates with the amount of
rainfall (Blair 1950).
The province has a high faunal diversity. Blair (1950) identified at least 47 species of mammals, 41 species
of reptiles, and 35 species of amphibians native to the region. Blair (1950) defines the following mammals
as common within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus), red bat (Lasiurus
carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying squirrel
(Glaucomys volans), gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Historically, red wolf, bison, and black bear ranged into or near the project area,
although bison was intermittently absent from the region (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Dillehay 1974;
Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Common land turtles include the eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and western box turtle (Terrapene
ornate), while the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise common water turtles. Common lizards include the
green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), broad-headed skink
(Eumeces laticeps), six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineatus), and eastern grass lizard (Ophisaurus
ventralis). Snakes, amphibians, and birds are also present in considerable numbers and diversity (Blair
1950).
The reptilian assemblage includes the racer (Coluber constrictor), rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), timber
rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getulus), woodhouse toad (Bufo
woodhousii), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), eastern box turtle, and the
Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Breeding birds common to the wooded areas include black vulture (Coragyps atratus), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus),
mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), downy woodpecker
(Picoides pubescens), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata),
American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), northern mockingbird (Mimus
polyglottos), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), painted bunting (Passerina ciris), and lark sparrow
(Chondestes grammacus). Migratory species within wooded areas include yellow-bellied sapsucker
(Sphyrapicus varius), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), ruby-crowned
kinglet (Regulus calendula), hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and
many sparrows (Bull and Farrand 1977; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review of the
proposed project area, as well as a 1-mile radius around the project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed
the corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), a restricted online database, for any previously recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric sites
located in or near the project area. Site files, relevant maps, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys were also examined. Listings on TASA are limited to projects under
purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the NHPA of 1966. Therefore, all work conducted in the area
may not be available. The Texas Historic Sites Overlay, aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also examined for historical and environmental information
related to the project area.

Previous Investigations
The background review revealed that no cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the project
area; however, several have been conducted within the general vicinity (Table 1; Figure 2). The majority
of these have been for the Cypress Creek/Cypresswood Golf Course and along Cypress Creek (THC 2017).

Archaeological Sites
At least 20 archaeological sites have been identified within 1 mile of the project area (Table 2; see Figure
2). These include 10 sites (41HR584â592 and 41HR596) that were identified in 1986 within the Cypress
Creek Golf Club (THC 2017). At the time, the THC determined that the sites were eligible for the NRHP
and for designation as SALs; however, as the sites are generally composed of a few pieces of lithic debitage,
an occasional ceramic fragment, and no features (THC 2017), further testing of these sites would be
recommended. None of these sites would be impacted by the currently proposed project.

Site 41HR630 is located approximately 192 feet from the proposed project area. This prehistoric campsite
was identified by Texas A&M in 1989 (THC 2017). Texas A&M described the site as containing flakes
and one ceramic sherd between 0 and 90 cmbs in an area measuring 20 x 20 m in size (THC 2017). Texas
A&M recommended the site eligible for the NRHP. The site would not be impacted by the proposed project.

Cemeteries
Two cemeteries, the Tetter Cemetery and the Tetter Negro Cemetery (THC 2017; Find A Grave 2017a,
2017b) are located approximately 0.25 and 0.33 mile from the project area, respectively. Neither cemetery
will be impacted by the proposed project. No historical markers or NRHP listed properties or districts are
located within 1 mile of the project area.

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Field Methods
The archaeological investigation of the proposed project area was designed to be of sufficient intensity to
determine the nature, extent, and if possible, significance of any cultural resources located within the project
area. An intensive pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing was conducted within the project area.
The survey met all THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects with any exceptions
thoroughly documented. The field survey consisted of two archaeologists walking one transect within a
100-foot-wide survey corridor. During the survey, the archaeologists examined the ground surface and
erosional profiles for cultural resources. This examination included pedestrian survey with shovel testing
within the proposed project area.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth, to culturally
sterile deposits, or to the anticipated depth of disturbance for the project, whichever came first. The matrix
was screened through Â¼-inch hardware mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted using a global
positioning system (GPS) receiver, and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms.
A review of the soils in the project area indicates they are deep Holocene alluvium; therefore, backhoe
trenching would normally be required. However, due to the nature of the proposed project, SWCA assumes
that the depth of project impacts will be shallow (2 feet or less); therefore, no backhoe trenching will be
necessary. If mechanical land clearing or deeper subsurface impacts will occur, then deep backhoe testing
may be necessary.
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. Per requirements for the Antiquities Code of Texas, project
documentation will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Results of Field Investigations
Intensive archaeological survey was conducted throughout the project area from May 18 to 19, 2017. A
total of 34 shovel tests were excavated; all were negative for cultural materials (Figure 3 and Figure 4). One
additional shovel test was attempted, but not excavated due to location on a heavily modified bank of
Turkey Creek. Soils were typically sandy loams over basal clay. The results for all shovel tests are presented
in Appendix A.
Portions of the survey corridor followed areas with existing path (Figure 5). Other portions of the survey
corridor were in areas that had been previously cleared with a brush hog, with downed trees in the area, and
some areas had not been recently cleared (Figure 6). Ground surface visibility ranged from 0 to 50 percent.
No prehistoric or historic-age cultural resources were identified during the survey. A collapsed, modern
picnic shelter was identified north of the centerline on the eastern side of the park. The large framed wooden
shelter measures approximately 26 feet north-south by 18 feet east-west (Figure 7). A small, square,
concrete pad approximately 2.5 feet in diameter was identified approximately 1 m north of the structure
and was likely a base for a barbeque grill. Based on aerial photographs, the shelter was likely erected circa
2002 in the vicinity of two paths that cross in that area near Cypress Creek.

Intensive Archaeological Survey of the Proposed Turkey Creek Park Equestrian Trail, Harris County, Texas

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Harris County, SWCA has conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed
Turkey Creek Park Equestrian Trail. Harris County proposes to construct an equestrian trail within Turkey
Creek Park in northern Harris County. The proposed trail will be 12 feet wide within a 20-foot-wide
maintained corridor approximately 1.32 miles long. A 100-foot-wide corridor was investigated to allow for
minor adjustments to the alignment. Construction areas will also include approximately 0.39 mile of access
road and an approximately 2.5-acre staging area. Overall project dimensions total approximately 23 acres.
Depth of project impacts are expected to be 1 to 2 feet below surface or less.
Archaeological investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit
in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures
for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated
April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); and Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing
regulations 36 CFR 800. As the project area is owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, work
was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative
Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8028.
The background review revealed no previously conducted cultural resources surveys within the proposed
project area. Additionally, no previously recorded cultural resources have been identified within the project
area.
During the investigation, a total of 34 shovel tests were excavated; all were negative for cultural materials.
One additional shovel test was attempted, but not excavated due to location on a heavily modified bank of
Turkey Creek. No prehistoric or historic-age cultural resources were identified. A collapsed, modern picnic
shelter was identified north of the centerline towards Cypress Creek.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
project area. No properties listed or otherwise eligible for the NRHP, or for designation as a SAL, were
identified within the project area. Consequently, SWCA recommends no further archaeological
investigation and a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED under 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1). Per
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas, project documentation will be curated with the TARL in
Austin.
