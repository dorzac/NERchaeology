MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by the Lake Travis
Independent School District (LTISD), to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the approximately 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) Perkins tract in southwestern Travis
County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would consist of construction of (1) an approximately
1.0-kilometer- (0.6-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed new road right-of-way
(ROW) extending between Vail Divide Road on the north and Hamilton Pool Road on the south
(3.1 hectares [7.6 acres]) and (2) a proposed storm water detention pond located off the eastern
side of the proposed road ROW (0.4 hectare [1.0 acre]), covering a total area of 3.5 hectares
(8.6 acres). For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area is considered to
consist of the entire 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) area inclusive of the new road ROW and the detention
pond.
The proposed project is being sponsored by LTISD, a political subdivision of the state of
Texas. Consequently, the proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas. At this time, no federal permits, funding, or licenses have been identified for the project;
however, it is possible that federal permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors
Act may be required. In this case, any portion of the overall project area covered under the federal
permit would also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking
with the potential to impact potentially significant cultural resources, the project sponsor is
required to perform a cultural resources inventory and assessment of the project area. The
cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7993.
On April 14, 2017, Horizon archeological technician Jacob Lyons, under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resources
survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) project
area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The project area spans a series of heavily dissected upland limestone ridges covered
with scrubland vegetation, including scattered Ashe juniper, short shrubs, clump grasses, weeds,
and wildflowers. Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and decomposing limestone gravels

are present on the modern ground surface across the project area, and only a very thin veneer of
sediment is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in most areas.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) for linear
surveys per 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) of ROW width. For block-area surveys, the TSMASS require
a minimum of 3 shovel tests per 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre) for project areas measuring less than
0.8 hectares (2.0 acres) in size. Thus, a minimum of 10 shovel tests would be required within the
1.0-kilometer- (0.6-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed new road ROW and
3 shovel tests would be required within the 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre) proposed detention pond
footprint, for a total of 13 shovel tests. Horizon excavated a total of 21 shovel tests during the
survey, including 17 within the proposed road ROW and 4 within the proposed detention pond
footprint, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. The
pedestrian survey and shovel testing typically revealed shallow silty loam and silty clay loam
sediments overlying limestone bedrock or dense clay subsoil.
One newly recorded aboriginal archeological site, 41TV2537, was documented within the
project area during the survey. This site consists of a low-density, surface and shallow subsurface
scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage, including approximately five primary flakes, 10 secondary
flakes, and 30 tertiary flakes, on an eroded and moderately disturbed limestone upland. No formal
tools, temporally diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or preserved floral or faunal remains were
observed. The site is interpreted as the remnants of a small bivouac or campsite, or possibly a
lithic raw material procurement locality, dating to an unspecified prehistoric timeframe. Surficial
disturbances from brush clearing, construction of a fence line, and construction of a residential
subdivision on the adjacent parcel to the southeast, were noted. Based on the lack of integrity
and minimal research value of the archeological deposits, site 41TV2537 is recommended as
ineligible for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by the Lake Travis
Independent School District (LTISD), to conduct an intensive cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the approximately 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) Perkins tract in southwestern Travis
County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would consist of construction of (1) an approximately
1.0-kilometer- (0.6-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed new road right-of-way
(ROW) extending between Vail Divide Road on the north and Hamilton Pool Road on the south
(3.1 hectares [7.6 acres]) and (2) a proposed storm water detention pond located off the eastern
side of the proposed road ROW (0.4 hectare [1.0 acre]), covering a total area of 3.5 hectares
(8.6 acres). For purposes of the cultural resources survey, the project area is considered to
consist of the entire 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) area inclusive of the new road ROW and the detention
pond (Figures 1 to 2).
The proposed project is being sponsored by LTISD, a political subdivision of the state of
Texas. Consequently, the proposed project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). At this time, no federal permits, funding,
or licenses have been identified for the project; however, it is possible that federal permits issued
by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA)
and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act may be required. In this case, any portion of the
overall project area covered under the federal permit would also fall under the jurisdiction of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. As the project
represents a publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact potentially significant
cultural resources, the project sponsor is required to perform a cultural resources inventory and
assessment of the project area.
On April 14, 2017, Horizon archeological technician Jacob Lyons, under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resources
survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review,
an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The
cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7993.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in southwestern Travis County in Central Texas near the
boundary of two significant physiographic provinces—the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland
Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a
narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in
northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow
at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a
great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed
primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this
boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more
gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of
topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life. The project area is situated in
the Balcones Canyonlands and spans a series of heavily dissected, eroding upland ridge fingers
that slope generally down to the southeast toward Little Barton Creek and one of its unnamed
tributaries. Elevations within the project area are highly variable and slopes are typically
moderate, ranging from as high as 335.4 meters (1,100 feet) above mean sea level (amsl) near
the crests of the ridges to as low as 307.9 meters (1,010 feet) amsl adjacent to Little Barton Creek.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Colorado River basin. The project
area is located in a predominantly upland setting that spans a series of limestone ridge fingers
that are heavily dissected by Little Barton Creek and one of its unnamed, intermittent tributaries.
Little Barton Creek crosses the project area just north of Hamilton Pool Road, and an unnamed
tributary of Little Barton Creek crosses the approximate midpoint of the project area. Little Barton
Creek flows generally eastward, discharging into Barton Creek proper east of Bee Cave. Barton
Creek flows generally eastward to its confluence with the Colorado River in southwestern Austin.
The Colorado River, in turn, flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and the Gulf
Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of
Matagorda Bay.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

2.1.1

Geology and Geomorphology

The project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata. Major geologic units that crop out in the vicinity of the project area include the Edwards
Limestone Formation, Glen Rose Formation (upper and lower parts), Pecan Gap Chalk, and
Austin Chalk. Specifically, the project area is underlain by the Glen Rose Formation (Kgr[u]),
which consists of thick deposits of limestone, dolomite, and marl (Barnes 1981).
The project area traverses three soil units (Table 1; Figure 3) (NRCS 2017). BrackettRock outcrop complex, 1 to 12% slopes (BID), characterizes the uplands within the northern half
of the project area. Tarrant soils, 5 to 18% slopes (TaD), characterizes a small upland area in
the central portion of the project area. Volente silty clay loam, 1 to 8% slopes (VoD), is found in
the valleys of Little Barton Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries in the southern and central
portions of the project area, respectively. The soils that compose the upland settings within the
project area consist of thin veneers of gravelly sediment overlying bedrock. Other things being
equal, any cultural resources associated with these soils would be expected to occur on the
modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that would lack stratigraphic integrity. The
clayey alluvium found in the stream valleys possesses some potential for shallowly buried
archeological deposits, though the erosional character of downcutting streams in upland settings
would tend to suggest that archeological deposits would be scoured and dislocated rather than
buried and preserved within the project area.
2.1.2

Climate

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable.
The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate
that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by
1,500 years ago.
Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is influenced
primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by polar air
masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest
regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west
and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and temperature
averages 19°Celsius (°C) (67°Fahrenheit [°F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to
63.5 centimeters (12.0 to 25.0 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to
127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall. Two
extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-cm (22.0-inches)
deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts
are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that
there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.1.3

Biota

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary,
characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes
through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in the Texan province
is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), ground squirrel
(Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and
jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian province—eastern
box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—occur in the Texan province. Small
herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods,
but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).
Sixteen species of lizards, including seven grassland and nine forest species, are also
found, including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis [grassland
species]), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus
olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces
obsoletus [forest species]). Only five species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including
small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and

eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan
into the Austroriparian province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s chorus
frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile and
amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water snake
(Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
8.6-acre Perkins Tract, Travis County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the southeastern boundary of his Central Texas
Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, which borders Travis County on
the southeast. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been

practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These
include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest
population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation on the
part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas
began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly
diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century1. The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East Texas
in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de la
Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San Antonio
Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County developed
as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included Josiah and
Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The onset of the
Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the Alamo
prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended from
Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and Gilleland
Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8.0 kilometers (5.0 miles) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an eight-league grant
covering the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton
settled near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B.
Lamar was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site
for the capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of four families, and
about 20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on January 19, 1840. A few days later, the

Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly
40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution of
1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to the
capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion, office
buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population of 3,138,
of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the number of
residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves, and 13 free
blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its population rose
from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small communities. Pflugerville
and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but rural post offices were also
established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland, Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend.
During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was then Travis County increased from
73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field crop, while cattle and sheep were
the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced 137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels
of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities began
to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male and Female
Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female Institute in
1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic population of 183.
The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state established the
Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857. Travis County
became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the University of
Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint Edward's University
in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The Austin Presbyterian
Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy in 1912, Concordia
Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest in 1952.
Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of schools resulted in a
high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the 1940s, while more
rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over the age of 25 had high
school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated. By 1980, that number
had jumped to 75%.

The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety
of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland Creek
in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons settled
near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic priests,
among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a Church of
Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New Sweden and
a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church formed in Austin in
1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated combined membership
of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area was
at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that goods
had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads meant that
goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad Association was
established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable progress had been
made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on railroad acquisition was
postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on January 28, 1861. Although a
group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of secession, Unionist sentiment was
high, and Travis County residents voted against secession, 704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the
Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred volunteers, among them the Travis
Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the Austin City Light Infantry. In the two
months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal troops in the county, looting of farms
and businesses was common. Although the inevitable clashes between the Unionist forces and
the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as 30 people per day, the presence of federal
troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had
been mustered out of service, leaving only about 200 men to police the Austin area until the end
of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866
and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and
the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County
residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly two-thirds
of this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats took
up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern

HJN 170058 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to
Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin that
benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and Manchaca.
After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war, the black
population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870, black
residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased rapidly
thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other segments
of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with respect to
the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990. Contributing
to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups, the most
prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century, 8% of the
population was composed of natives of one of these countries. Although the early Swedish and
German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious and
educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival of
large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which was
fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in progress
at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its streets
remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses filled the
needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s population,
the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and agriculture dominated
the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late 1880s and remained so for
more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—nearly 30% of the county's
improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the amount of land devoted to
cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved farmland. However, as more
marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production levels fell; in 1930,
143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton accounted for only 26% of
the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%. Farm tenancy had increased
steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants operating two-thirds of the 3,642 farms.
The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as many tenant farmers either moved
away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained in the area began to devote more
of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock. The number of cattle increased
from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of sheep and goats increased as well,
boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and 4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and
to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late 1960s, hay and sorghum combined to
account for 60% of the cropland harvested.

The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many people
were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving streets;
building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of Texas
campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects, state
government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s, rising
from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s was the
construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had begun
efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge across the
river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its water and
electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and a major flood
in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that were underway,
and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown Austin under water,
and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The Lower Colorado River
Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake Austin, Lake Travis, Lake
Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble Falls. Travis County also
profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp Mabry in northwest Austin,
established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890, served as an army training center
during World War I. After the US became involved in World War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base,
soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established in southeast Travis County. After the
war was over, the presence of military personnel continued to bring changes to the county.
Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local colleges and universities, greatly increasing
the student population as well as intensifying the demand for housing and the growth of service
industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent two significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955. Local
Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against discriminatory
practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and protests in the
1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence prevalent in other
urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks and Hispanics were
elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and to the Texas House
of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971; Richard Moya to the
Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the Texas House of
Representatives in 1974. The second major development was the establishment of several hightech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor,
Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations. International Business Machines opened an
Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in 1974. These companies, along with
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (1983), Dell Computers (1984), and
Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.
From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only three
of them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson
in 1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although agriculture
remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly surpassed by the
income generated by non-agricultural industries.
Professional and related services,
manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved 70% of the
work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed outside the county.
Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County residents had resided in
the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the high-tech industries reinforced
that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the capital city. In the 1970s and
1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis encouraged many people to move
away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at a rapid pace, the number of residents
choosing to live near the lake and in northern and southern suburbs increased at an even faster
rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown (1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and
Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson
County, had become popular alternatives to living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County
weathered a serious economic downturn in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty,
and many people lost their jobs. Added to this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was
scheduled to close. In the early 1990s, however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom
site into a new municipal airport, and the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The
population of Travis County was reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980.
Among the area’s most prevalent concerns was that future growth should not destroy the
ecological balance of environmentally sensitive areas in the western hills.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) for information on previously recorded cultural
resources sites and historic properties in and near the proposed project area as well as previous
cultural resources investigations conducted in the vicinity of the proposed project area. Based on
this archival research, nine previously recorded archeological sites are present within a 1.6kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area (Table 2; Figure 4). All nine sites consist of
aboriginal burned rock middens and/or scatters of lithic artifacts. Most sites have been dated only
to undetermined prehistoric timeframes, though projectile points diagnostic of the Early to Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods have been observed on three of the sites. All of the
previously recorded sites are located well beyond the boundaries of the project area and would
have no potential to be affected by the proposed undertaking. No cemeteries or historic properties
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) are present within the project area or within the desktop archival study radius.
One prior cultural resources survey, consisting of a linear utility survey conducted parallel
to the Hamilton Pool Road ROW, crosses the project area near its southern end, though the
majority of the project area has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

On April 14, 2017, Horizon archeological technician Jacob Lyons, under the overall
direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resources
survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologist traversed the 3.5-hectare (8.6-acre) project
area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The project area extends from Vail Divide Road on the north to Hamilton Pool Road
on the south, spanning a series of heavily dissected upland limestone ridges covered with
scrubland vegetation, including scattered Ashe juniper, short shrubs, clump grasses, weeds, and
wildflowers. Extensive exposures of limestone bedrock and decomposing limestone gravels are
present on the modern ground surface across the project area, and only a very thin veneer of
sediment is present overlying bedrock or dense clay subsoil in most areas. The project area also
spans the channels of Little Barton Creek and one of its unnamed, intermittent tributaries
(Figures 5 to 8).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1.0 mile) for linear
surveys per 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) of ROW width. For block-area surveys, the TSMASS require
a minimum of 3 shovel tests per 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre) for project areas measuring less than
0.8 hectares (2.0 acres) in size. Thus, a minimum of 10 shovel tests would be required within the
1.0-kilometer- (0.6-mile-) long by 30.5-meter- (100.0-foot-) wide proposed new road ROW and
3 shovel tests would be required within the 0.4 hectare (1.0 acre) proposed detention pond
footprint, for a total of 13 shovel tests. Horizon excavated a total of 21 shovel tests during the
survey, including 17 within the proposed road ROW and 4 within the proposed detention pond
footprint, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size (Figure 9).
The pedestrian survey and shovel testing typically revealed shallow, gravelly silty loam and silty
clay loam sediments overlying limestone bedrock or dense clay subsoil at depths of 5.0 to
40.0 centimeters (2.0 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Sediments excavated from shovel tests
were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Specific shovel test data are
presented in Appendix A.
One newly recorded archeological site, 41TV2537, was documented during the survey.
In the field, a standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information on location,
physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts
observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of

surface and subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn that illustrated
site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well
as notable features of the landscape. The site was thoroughly photo-documented using color
digital photography, and photographic logs were maintained of all photographs taken. Based on
the information recorded on the standard archeological site recording form in the field, a Texas
Archeological Data Site Update Form was completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the
most current version of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite
archeological data collection software, and the form was submitted to TARL to update the existing
site files.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural resources were collected during the survey.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

One newly recorded archeological site, 41TV2537, was recorded within the project area
during the cultural resources survey. This site consists of a low-density scatter of aboriginal lithic
artifacts on the crest and slopes of a limestone ridge that has been interpreted as the remnants
of a small bivouac or campsite, or possibly a raw material lithic raw material procurement site.
The site is described in more detail below.
In addition, a modern house is present in within the proposed road ROW near the southern
end of the project area between Hamilton Pool Road and Little Barton Creek (Figures 10 to 11).
This house is an adobe mansion reflecting stylistic elements of Spanish and Mexican villas.
Based on examination of historical aerial photographs, the house was constructed between 1995
and 2004, though it does not appear to have been occupied for long and it is currently abandoned.
This house is not of historic age and does not warrant further investigation.

6.1

SITE 41TV2537
General Observations

Site 41TV2537 consists of a surficial and shallow subsurface, low-density scatter of
aboriginal lithic artifacts on an upland ridge finger overlooking an unnamed, intermittent tributary
of Little Barton Creek to the east (Figures 12 to 13). Vegetation on the site consists of prickly
pear cactus, mesquite, juniper trees, and short grasses. Sheets of limestone bedrock and beds
of decomposing limestone gravels are exposed on the modern ground surface across much of
the site area, and moderate to heavy surficial disturbances have been caused by construction of
an adjacent residential subdivision to the southeast and a fence line that passes through the site
(Figures 14 to 16). The site slopes down to the east, and the modern ground surface ranges in
elevation from 303.4 to 306.4 meters (995.0 to 1,005.0 feet) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural materials observed on the modern ground surface, site
41TV2537 measures approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) northeast to southwest by
85.0 meters (278.8 feet) northeast to southwest. Observed cultural materials are constrained
mainly to the deflated modern ground surface, though three tertiary lithic flakes were observed in
one of the six shovel tests excavated on the site extending to a depth of 10.0 centimeters

area boundaries, though the site boundaries were fully delineated during the survey.
Observed Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on site 41TV2537, and no indirect evidence of cultural
features, such as burned rocks, was encountered.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41TV2537 consist entirely of lithic debitage,
including approximately five primary flakes, 10 secondary flakes, and 30 tertiary flakes,
manufactured from medium- to fine-grained Edwards Formation chert (Figure 17). No temporally
diagnostic artifacts or floral or faunal materials were observed.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41TV2537 consists of a low-density, surface and shallow subsurface scatter of
aboriginal lithic debitage, including approximately five primary flakes, 10 secondary flakes, and
30 tertiary flakes, on an eroded and moderately disturbed limestone upland. No formal tools,
temporally diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or preserved floral or faunal remains were
observed. The site is interpreted as the remnants of a small bivouac or campsite, or possibly a
lithic raw material procurement locality, dating to an unspecified prehistoric timeframe. Surficial

disturbances from brush clearing, construction of a fence line, and construction of a residential
subdivision on the adjacent parcel to the southeast, were noted. Based on the lack of integrity
and minimal research value of the archeological deposits, site 41TV2537 is recommended as
ineligible for designation as an SAL.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluation.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources are evaluated
according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological resources for
designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
8.6-acre Perkins Tract, Travis County, Texas

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

One newly recorded aboriginal archeological site, 41TV2537, was recorded within the
project area during the survey (Table 3). This site consists of a low-density scatter of aboriginal
lithic debitage on an eroded limestone upland. No temporally diagnostic tools, burned rocks,
cultural features, or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed. The site is interpreted as
the remnants of a small bivouac or campsite, or possibly a raw material lithic raw material
procurement site, dating to an unspecified prehistoric timeframe. Based on the lack of integrity
and minimal research value of the archeological deposits, site 41TV2537 is recommended as
ineligible for designation as an SAL.

7.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the

criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no
historic properties affected,” and no further archeological work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are
protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or
burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and the THC should be notified
immediately.
