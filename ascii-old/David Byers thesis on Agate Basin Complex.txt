CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The identification of Paleoindian artifacts in association with large bonebeds has
resulted in a number of investigations designed to enhance our understanding of Late
Pleistocene animal resource exploitation (Bement 1999; Frison 1974, 1992; Frison and
Todd 1986, 1987; Jodry and Stanford 1992; Johnson 1977, 1999; Todd 1987a, 1987b,
1991; Wheat 1972, 1979). Although a number of Paleoindian-age bonebeds have been
excavated, subsistence patterns from this period are still poorly understood. The goal of
my research is to add to our knowledge of Paleoindian, specifically Agate Basin
Complex, lifeways through the analysis of the faunal materials recovered from the Agate
Basin levels at the Hell Gap Site Locality II in east-central Wyoming (Agogino and
Irwin-Williams 1971; Irwin 1969, 1970, 1973; Irwin and Brew 1968; Irwin et al. 1965;
Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
The Agate Basin Complex
The Agate Basin Complex (Roberts 1943), named after the type-site in eastern
Wyoming, is a Paleoindian manifestation known for slender, well-made, lanceolate
projectile points (Figure 1.1). Based primarily on investigations at the type-site, a big
game hunting economy approximately 9,500 to 10,500 years ago (Frison 1992:164 - 170)
appears to characterize the Agate Basin Complex. While Agate Basin artifacts have been
recovered throughout the Plains from Texas to Alberta and as far east as Illinois (Dixon
1999:229; Stanford 1999:311-316), limited research has been conducted into Agate Basin
adaptations (Frison 1984; Frison and Stanford 1982; Haynes 1955; Irwin 1967;
Wormington 1988). Instead, the majority of the publications concerning the Agate Basin
1

Basin faunal assemblage.

complex consist of descriptions of privately collected projectile points published in
regional and avocational journals (for example Pettipas 1970, 1977). In fact, only one
publication (Frison and Stanford 1982) addresses Agate Basin outside the broad
framework of Paleoindian chronology. Given the paucity of information specifically
assessing Agate Basin Complex subsistence, the opportunity to evaluate the Locality II
faunal materials should provide an important addition to the extant body of knowledge.
Research Questions
My thesis seeks to expand our understanding of Paleoindian subsistence through
the analysis of the Agate Basin component faunal assemblage recovered at the Hell Gap
Site (48GO305), Locality II (Agogino and Irwin-Williams 1971; Irwin 1969, 1970, 1973;

2

Irwin and Brew 1968; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973). The Hell Gap Site, located in eastern
Wyoming, has produced extensive cultural assemblages representing almost the entire
record of the region’s Paleoindian occupation (Irwin-Williams et al. 1973:40). In
contrast to many Paleoindian kill sites, the Hell Gap localities appear to span a range of
residential activities (Irwin-Williams et al. 1973; Knell 1999; Sellet 1999) and thus, offer
the potential for a more complete understanding of Paleoindian behavior.
Specifically, my research seeks to understand transport and utilization decisions
related to the exploitation of large body size Late Pleistocene faunal resources. Questions
of interest include transport decisions and how these decisions might relate to the utility
of the meat packages represented in the assemblage (Bartram 1993; Binford 1978;
Emerson 1990, 1993; Metcalf and Jones 1988; O’Connell et al. 1988). In addition, what
taphonomic agents may have been involved in the formational history of the Locality II
Agate Basin faunal assemblage (Binford 1978, 1981; Blumenschine and Marean 1993;
Capaldo 1998; Enloe 1993; Marean and Spencer 1991)? Finally, what can the answers to
the questions posed above tell us about Paleoindian subsistence patterns? In response, I
will demonstrate that bison dominate the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage.
Further, I will argue that if the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains are accepted as a
representative sample of the faunal materials introduced into the Locality II deposits
10,000 years ago, then elements highest in within-bone fat utility are the best represented
skeletal parts. Such a bias towards high fat utility skeletal parts suggests that the Agate
Basin Paleoindians occupying the Hell Gap Valley were employing food-getting
behaviors designed to maximize the amount of fat as well as protein in their diets.

Research Design
Here, I outline the research strategy employed in the following chapters. Two
complementary strategies are employed to analyze the Locality II Agate Basin faunal
(bison) materials. The first part of my analysis will assess the Locality II Agate Basin
bison remains at the assemblage level through an evaluation of the skeletal element
frequencies present in the assemblage (Chapter 3). In the second part of my analysis, I
will conduct a specimen level attribute analysis employing a visual inspection of each
specimen (Chapter 4) in an effort to identify bone modifications supporting the inferences
drawn from the relationship between skeletal part frequencies and nutritional utility.
Assemblage Level Analysis: Skeletal Element Frequencies
In the first part of my analysis I evaluate the faunal remains as an aggregate,
assessing the attributes of the sample at the assemblage level. I investigate the
implications that the differential representation of skeletal parts has for the deposit’s
formational history. Investigators have acknowledged the potential for skeletal element
frequencies to answer archaeological questions. White (1952a, 1952b, 1952c, 1953a,
1953b, 1954, 1955) was one of the first to recognize the explanatory potential of
archaeological faunal remains by suggesting that differences between the expected, or
total element count in a given prey species, and observed frequencies of skeletal elements
within an archaeological faunal assemblage may result from prehistoric subsistence
strategies. White’s observation was an important intuitive leap, instructing
archaeologists in the then untapped potential for faunal remains to inform researchers on
prehistoric subsistence behaviors. Since the 1950’s, several investigators have pursued
ethnoarchaeological studies related to faunal resources, resulting in a number of models

4

for the interpretation of zooarchaeological assemblages (Bartram 1993; Bartram et al.
1991; Binford 1978, 1981, 1984; Bunn et al. 1988; Gifford-Gonzalez 1989b; Metcalf and
Barlow 1992; Monahan 1998; O’Connell et al. 1988, 1990; Perkins and Daly 1968;
Yellen 1977). Further, the awareness of the differing relationships between skeletal parts
and their relative nutritional values has led to the definition of utility indices for several
prey species, ranging from ungulates to pinipeds (Binford 1978; Blumenschine and Caro
1986; Brink 1997; Emerson 1990; Jones and Metcalf 1988; Lyman et al. 1992; Metcalf
and Jones 1988; O’Connell and Marshal 1990; Outram and Rowley-Conwy 1998).
Through the ethnoarchaeological evaluation of utility indices, faunal analysts
have come to recognize a number of transport strategies based on the patterned
relationships between utility indices and differential skeletal part representation in
archaeological assemblages (Binford 1978; Thomas and Mayer 1983). Transport
strategies are offered as explanations for the differential representation of skeletal
elements contained in archaeological deposits as functions of the field butchering (animal
parts left at the mortality site) and transport decisions (items returned to the residential
base) involved in hunter-gatherer subsistence behaviors. I will compare skeletal part
frequencies with nutritional utility indices for bison (Emerson 1990) to identify any
relationships indicative of behaviors designed to maximize certain food products in the
diet of the Hell Gap Locality II Agate Basin Complex Paleoindians.
While skeletal element summaries are potentially useful tools for evaluating
prehistoric hunter-gatherer behavior, they can and often do reflect the actions of nonhuman taphonomic agents (Binford 1981; Blumenschine and Marean 1993; Capaldo
1998; Gifford-Gonzalez 1989a, 1991; Grayson 1989; Hudson 1993; Lyman 1984, 1985,

5

1991, 1993; Marean and Spencer 1991). Non-human processes such as density-mediated
attrition (resulting in the breakdown and loss of bone tissue) and carnivore ravaging can
selectively delete or render unidentifiable skeletal parts from archaeological deposits,
resulting in skeletal part profiles mimicking patterns created by certain transport
strategies (Lyman 1985, 1993). I will assess the extent that the Locality II Agate Basin
bison remains may have been conditioned through density-mediated attrition by
comparing volume bone mineral density values for bison (Kreutzer 1992) with the
survivorship of skeletal parts represented in the assemblage.
In addition to density-mediated attrition, actualistic experimentation has shown
carnivore modification (ravaging) to condition the survivorship of skeletal part
frequencies (Bartram and Marean 1999; Binford 1981; Blumenschine and Marean 1993;
Blumenschine and Selvaggio 1991; Brain 1967, 1969; Haynes 1980, 1983; Hudson 1993;
Marean and Spencer 1991; Selvaggio 1998). Because low-density bones are often porous
and tend to have high grease contents, they are often targets for predators and scavengers
(Blumenschine and Marean 1993:283; Marean and Spencer 1991:653). Faunal analysts
have offered several methods to monitor carnivore activity both in relation to densitymediated attrition and to long bone fragmentation. For example, because canids
selectively delete long bone epiphyses, analyses of the ratios of mid-shaft specimens to
distal and proximal shaft ends (excluding epiphyses) can be applied to monitor the level
of carnivore modification within an assemblage (Marean and Spencer 1991). To assess
potential carnivore modification of the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage, I will
employ Blumenschine and Marean’s (1993) model suggesting that ratios of long bone

6

epiphyses to long bone shaft fragments can successfully evaluate intensity of ravaging
affecting a faunal assemblage.
Specimen Level Attributes: Bone Surface Modifications and Impact Flake Scars
While much can be learned about an archaeological faunal assemblage from an
assessment of correlations between skeletal element frequencies and nutritional utility
indices, such analyses should be viewed with caution. Because correlations do not
always equal cause, and because most archaeological deposits have complex, multidimensional formational histories, a complementary analysis is required to evaluate
relationships between survivorship and utility. In the case of faunal analysis, the
researcher has at his or her disposal the specimens employed to derive the statistical
relationships, and as such has the opportunity to observe individual specimen attributes as
a method for evaluating assemblage level patterning.
I employ a visual inspection of individual specimens in combination with the
published descriptions of modifications produced by rodents, carnivores (Binford 1981;
Fisher 1995; Haynes 1980) and recent hunter-gatherers (Binford 1978, 1981; Yellen
1977) to assess the formational history of the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage.
Rodents and carnivores have been shown to condition a faunal assemblage and a number
of publications describe the resulting modifications (Binford 1981; Blumenschine 1988;
Blumenschine and Marean 1993; Capaldo 1998, Dixon 1988; Haynes 1980, 1983;
Hudson 1993; Maguire et al. 1980). In addition to publications discussing rodent and
carnivore modifications, a number of studies discuss the nature and placement of
modifications resulting from butchery and marrow processing (Binford 1981; Bunn 1981;
Eickhoff and Herrmann 1985; Fisher 1995; Lyman 1987; Potts and Shipman 1981;

7

Shipman and Rose 1983; Walker and Long 1977). If a relationship is identified between
the Locality II Agate Basin skeletal part summaries and nutritional utility, and if such a
relationship is a product of human subsistence, then observed bone modifications should
reflect the patterned extraction of food products from the anatomical portions introduced
into the Locality II deposits.
Thesis Organization
Evaluating the transport and utilization decisions reflected in the Hell Gap Site
Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage requires a number of steps. I begin with a
discussion of the Locality II field investigations (Chapter 2). I outline the site setting and
discuss the history of excavations at the site with emphasis on the Agate Basin
component, define my data collection methodology and describe the faunal assemblage.
Finally, in Chapter 2, I address biases potentially introduced into the assemblage during
excavation and curation. In Chapter 3, I offer an overview of the research into skeletal
part frequencies and conduct an assemblage level analysis of the Locality II Agate Basin
faunal remains. In Chapter 3, I argue that human agents are most likely responsible for
the majority of the patterning observed in skeletal part summaries. In Chapter 4, a
discussion of bone surface modifications and breakage patterns observed in the
assemblage is presented to support the conclusions drawn in Chapter 3. I suggest that in
general, the majority of the observed bone modifications result from butchering and
processing. In Chapter 5, skeletal part summaries and butchering patterns are tied
together with fat-mediated nutritional requirements and models of hunter-gatherer
subsistence and settlement. In Chapter 6, I conclude by arguing that the Locality II Agate

8

Basin animal remains reflect a little known Paleoindian subsistence pattern, one requiring
further investigation to be better understood.

CHAPTER 2
BACKGROUND
Archaeological assemblages must be understood within their depositional
contexts, the ecological setting contributing to site formation, and excavation and
curation methodologies (Rapson and Niven 2000a; Todd and Rapson 1999). The
assemblage analyzed here is no exception. In Chapter 2, I introduce the Hell Gap Site
(48GO305; Irwin Williams et al. 1973), outline the site setting, and discuss the history of
excavations at the site with an emphasis on the Locality II Agate Basin component. I
continue by describing the composition of the faunal assemblage and conclude by
identifying biases potentially introduced into the assemblage during excavation and
curation.
Site Setting
The Hell Gap Site is located approximately 40 km north of Guernsey, Wyoming
at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level at 42° 24’ north latitude and 104° 38’
west longitude (Irwin Williams et al. 1973:40). The site consists of five localities
(Localities I – V, Figure 2.1) located between low hills at the ecotonal boundary between
the eastern slope of the Hartville Uplift’s Haystack Range and the Great Plains (Irwin
1969; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973). At present, the Hell Gap Valley is characterized by
yellow pine and juniper forest on the uplands and hill slopes, with drainage bottoms
containing willow, box elder, poplars and other deciduous species (Irwin Williams et al.
1973:40). Grasses, yucca, and prickly pear cactus dominate the local understory (IrwinWilliams et al. 1973:40). In addition to sheltered campsite locations in a diverse

(1973) and Knell (1999).

environment, numerous seeps in the drainage bottom presently provide water sources
(Irwin-Williams et al. 1973:40).
Little paleoenvironmental information is presently available for the Hell Gap area
during the period of Paleoindian occupation. However, one source, an assessment of soil
development in the Hell Gap Valley (Reider 1999), offers some insight into the local
environment during the Agate Basin occupation. Reider (1999:26) identifies the soil unit
associated with the Folsom-Midland-Agate Basin occupation at Locality I as an Aquoll, a
soil resulting from wet-meadow conditions. The presence of an Aquoll at both Localities
I and III, suggests that during the Agate Basin occupation, the Hell Gap Valley was

11

dominated by a wet-meadow environment fed by active springs originating in the fault
zone forming the drainage bottom (Reider 1999:26).
One reason for the numerous Paleoindian occupations of the Hell Gap Valley may
have been the abundant, high quality toolstones available in the surrounding area. Both
cherts and quartzites commonly outcrop in the Hartville Uplift (Reher 1991, Saul 1969).
A series of nearby aboriginal quarry sites are known collectively as the “Spanish
Diggings” and projectile points made from Spanish Diggings toolstones have been
recovered spanning the Early Paleoindian (Clovis) to Late Prehistoric periods (Saul
1969:184-185).
The Hell Gap Site
In 1959, James Duguid and Malcolm McKnight, avocational archaeologists and
University of Wyoming students, first recognized cultural deposits in the Hell Gap Valley
(Agogino and Irwin-Williams 1971:11). In response to reports of a potentially stratified
Paleoindian locality, Agogino and Haynes visited the site in 1959 and excavated a series
of test trenches (Agogino and Irwin-Williams 1971:11; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973:43).
In the summer of 1960, Agogino conducted a UW field school at the site (Agogino and
Irwin-Williams 1971:11). From 1961 to 1966, Henry Irwin and Cynthia Irwin-Williams,
under the supervision of J. O. Brew of Harvard University’s Peabody Museum,
conducted excavations at five localities in the Hell Gap Valley (Figure 2.1). More
recently, during the late 1990’s, the University of Wyoming has conducted limited
investigations centering on Locality I, in an effort to verify the stratigraphic sequence
described by Irwin (1967; Irwin et al. 1973) and to evaluate the site for continued
research potential (Kornfeld 2001, personal communication).

12

The Harvard excavations focused on the four localities identified as containing
Paleoindian materials and the results were used to define the Paleoindian chronology on
the northwest Plains (Irwin 1967). The most complete record was identified at Locality I
where Goshen, Folsom, Midland, Agate Basin, Hell Gap, Alberta, Cody, Frederick,
Archaic Period and Late Prehistoric Period materials were recovered in a stratigraphic
sequence (Irwin et al. 1973). Locality II, situated approximately 300 meters upstream
from Locality I, consists of an elongated bench at the base of a granite cliff on the east
side of the stream channel (Irwin Williams et al. 1973:43). Locality II produced a similar
deposit containing Midland, Agate Basin, Hell Gap and Lusk diagnostics. Locality III is
situated approximately 400 yards farther upstream from Locality II. Excavations at
Locality III recovered Agate Basin and Hell Gap artifacts. Locality V, located less than
100 yards to the southeast of Locality III, produced a dense concentration of Cody
complex materials. Late Prehistoric deposits were identified at Locality IV (not shown in
Figure 2.1), but not given the same intensive scrutiny received by the Paleoindian
components.
The original excavators recovered a rich artifact assemblage from the site. All of
the Paleoindian localities produced cultural horizons characterized by extensive
workshop debris resulting from repeated stone working episodes. In addition, diverse
tool kits consistent with a wide range of domestic activities, large lithic and bone scatters
in combination with possible structures suggest that a series of residential base camps
characterize the Hell Gap deposits and indicate repeated Paleoindian occupations through
the millennia (Irwin et al. 1973; Knell 1999; Sellet 1999).

Excavations at Locality II
At the unit level, records exist for the excavations conducted at Locality II during
the summers spanning 1961 to 1966 (Agogino and Irwin-Williams 1971; Field Notes
1966; Irwin 1969, 1970, 1973; Irwin and Brew 1968; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973). The
Locality II investigations exposed an area covering 205 three-foot square excavation
units along a north-south axis (Figure 2.2), resulting in the identification of a stratified
deposit containing materials from no less than four Paleoindian complexes, including
Midland, Agate Basin, Hell Gap and Lusk cultural complexes (Irwin et al. 1973).
Artifacts were collected at Locality II from a series of 6 x 6 ft. and 3 x 3 ft. units dug in 4
inch levels. The excavators employed trowels and picks to remove the matrix. Matrix
was screened through ¼ inch mesh hardware cloth. Provenience data for tools, bones and
debitage were recorded on unit specific planview maps.
Excavations began during the 1961 field season with eight test units, labeled AA
through HH (Field Notes 1966). The test excavations suggested that Locality II
contained an artifact-rich, stratified deposit. During the 1962 field season, a series of 6 x
6 ft. units were dug in the northern part of the excavation area that revealed the presence
of Hell Gap, Agate Basin and Midland components (Irwin 1970). The excavation of 6 x
6 ft. units continued during 1963 with an emphasis on increasing the Agate Basin and
Midland samples (Irwin and Brew 1968). During the 1964 field season, the excavators
switched to 3 x 3 ft. units and focused on the Midland deposits and an unknown cultural
horizon identified below the Midland material (Irwin 1969). The 1964 field season also
saw a significant flooding event (Irwin 1969) and photographs taken at the time show the
excavation block almost completely submerged.

excavations continued to expose portions of the Lusk, Agate Basin and Midland levels.
The deposit appears to have been excavated in 6 x 6 ft. units to the Midland component
where a switch was made to 3 x 3 ft. units (Field Notes 1966). While numerous
projectile points, and domestic tools were recovered from the lower levels, of particular
interest was the identification of a series of postholes, indicating the use of a structure
during at least one of the Agate Basin occupations (Agogino and Irwin-Williams 1971).
The summer of 1966 concluded the excavations at Locality II (and the Hell Gap Valley in
general) with investigations focusing on the Midland component (Irwin 1973)). In
addition to the recovery of numerous lithic artifacts and faunal remains, two sets of
postmolds were identified in the Midland level suggesting the presence of shelters.
The Locality II Agate Basin Component
The Agate Basin materials are contained within a depositional unit consisting of
“a series of tan silts of aeolian origin partly reworked from older silts, and [containing] a
discontinuous series of carbonaceous layers frequently associated with archaeological
remains” (Irwin-Williams et al. 1973:43). Two Agate Basin layers were defined (Figures
2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6), the “upper” and “lower” Agate Basin layers, and these were
separated in places by one to seven inches of sterile deposit (Irwin-Williams et al.
1973:43). However, the separation was not observed across the entire site and in many
places the two components merge. In addition, while sterile deposits separate most of the
Agate Basin component from the overlying Hell Gap deposits, in several units the
excavators experienced difficulty identifying the end of the Agate Basin materials and the
beginning of the underlying Midland deposit (e.g. map #s 174, 257, 260, 271, 302; Field
Notes 1966). Due to the unclear relationship between the “upper” and “lower”

Agate Basin layers, their contents have been combined and in this thesis are evaluated as
a single assemblage.
The Hell Gap Site Locality II Agate Basin Component Faunal Assemblage
At Locality II, the Agate Basin component produced an extensive assemblage of
animal remains. My analysis evaluated 1318 faunal specimens identified as Agate Basin
material. Due to the highly fragmentary nature of the sample, specimens were classified
in terms of body size classes after Brain (1981:9). Identification to species and element
was made in reference to comparative specimens included in the University of
Wyoming’s faunal collection. Analysis of the Locality II materials employed the faunal
coding system developed by Todd (1983:325-326, 1987a: 121-122) to document all
specimens identifiable to skeletal element (Appendix 1). Recorded attributes include
element, side, portion, segment, rodent damage, carnivore gnawing, breakage, butchery
and burning (Appendix 2). Evidence of butchery for all specimens identifiable to skeletal
element was illustrated on a template of the corresponding element. Each specimen was
numbered within the University of Wyoming Hell Gap Project cataloging system and all
data generated from the analysis were entered into a Microsoft Excel© (version 9.0)
database.
For analytical purposes, the Locality II faunal remains were quantified in terms of
NISP, MNI, MNE and MAU (Table 2.1). The number of identifiable specimens (NISP;
Grayson 1979:201) records the number of specimens identifiable to a given body size
class (Brain 1981:9). The minimum number of individuals (MNI; Grayson 1979:203)
identifies the minimum number of a given species or body class based on the most
frequently represented skeletal part. For example, the most common anatomical portion

observed in the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage was the anterior crest of the right
proximal tibia. A minimum of seven right tibia can be accounted for given the identified
specimens and as such a minimum of seven individuals are present. The minimum
number of individuals can also be derived through a maximum differentiation MNI
(Grayson 1973:31). Maximum differentiation MNI takes into account such factors as
size, age, sex and side when calculating MNI. Unfortunately the Locality II post-cranial
remains are too fragmentary for the maximum differentiation approach to yield
meaningful results. Teeth are however ideally suited for the calculation of maximum
differentiation MNI. In the case of the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains, based on
side, age group, and location (mandibular or maxillary), maximum differentiation MNI
22

represents a minimum number of fourteen individuals. The minimum number of
elements (MNE; Binford 1984:50) represents the minimum number of a specific element
represented in an assemblage. I base MNE values on the most common landmark
observed for each element, regardless of its location, proximal, distal or mid shaft. For
example, eight femur shaft fragments contain overlapping portions of the proximal most
supracondyloid fossa and distal-most linea aspera, five representing left femora and three
representing right femora, for an MNE value of eight elements. Minimum animal units
(MAU; Binford 1984:51) are derived by dividing the minimum element/portion count for
a given element (MNE) by the total number of that element/portion in a complete animal.
Dividing the MNE of eight for distal femora by the total number of distal femora in a
complete bison (two) yields an MAU value of four. Finally, %MAU simply standardizes
MAU values on a scale from 1 to 100, by dividing each element/portion’s MAU value by
the maximum MAU value calculated for an assemblage. Proximal tibia are the most
frequent anatomical portion present in the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage
(MAU=4.5). Dividing the value for distal femora (MAU=4) by the maximum value for
the assemblage (MAU=4.5) yields a %MAU for distal femora of 0.88.
In total, 98.6% (NISP=1300, Table 2.2) of the Locality II specimens were
identifiable to body size class 4 (Brain 1981:9), assumed here to be bison. Adult bison
remains dominate the assemblage, with 87.2% (NISP=1133) of the total body size 4
NISP representing non-juvenile and 0.8% (NISP=10) representing juvenile individuals,
while the remainder, 12.1% (NISP=157), could not be identified to age group.

Table 2.2 (continued)

Niven (2000b) suggests a minimum of fourteen individuals (maximum differentiation
MNI=14) for the Agate Basin assemblage, while non-dentition specimens represent an
MNI of seven based on right, proximal tibia portions. Body size 3 artiodactyls are also
present in the assemblage (1.4%, NISP=18) and these represent at least two individuals
(MNI=2). One is most likely deer (Odocoileus sp.) based on a single innominate
fragment and the other is most likely pronghorn (Antilocarpa americana), based on both
a single, distal femur shaft fragment and a single, distal tibia. Because so few body size 3
specimens are present, the analysis presented in the remainder of this thesis pertains only
to the bison (body size 4) remains.

Table 2.3 . Summary of bison dentition from the Locality II Agate Basin component.
Table adapted from Rapson and Niven (2000a).

examinations of tooth eruption and wear patterns present in bison teeth (Reher 1970;
Todd and Hofman 1987; Todd et al. 1996). Identification of two newborn/juvenile postcranial specimens (MNI=1) indicates the occupation of Locality II at least during or
shortly after the spring calving season. In addition, due to a relatively large number of
ageable tooth specimens, season of death information for the represented bison can be
evaluated through analysis of mandibular and maxillary dentition. Examination of
fourteen specimens (Table 2.3) complete enough to offer seasonality information

26

suggests occupation of Locality II throughout the year, with the most intensive use during
the fall, winter and spring months (Rapson and Niven 2000b).
Age and Sex Composition
The extremely fragmentary nature of the Locality II Agate Basin bison postcranial remains (e.g. few areas of epiphysial fusion were intact enough to age), combined
with the incomplete nature of the assemblage impedes the determination of an age
profile. In addition to the two newborn/juvenile, post-cranial specimens, only three
specimens display unfused epiphyses indicative of sub-adult individuals. The sub-adult,
post-cranial specimens include two calcanii, one with a completely unfused, calcanial
tuber (UWII-8963) and the other with a partially fused calcanial tuber (UWII-8448). One
metacarpal (UWII-8239) also displays an unfused distal epiphysis. Although post-cranial
elements offer little in determining the age composition of the faunal remains, the bison
dentitions included in the assemblage (Table 2.3) present an incomplete, although
intriguing picture (Rapson and Niven 2000b). Based on dental age groups, the age
profile of the represented individuals is biased either towards newborns and yearlings
(MNI=4), or older individuals, ages 4.9 to 7.9 years (MNI=7), with only a few
individuals representing younger adults, ages 1.3 to 3.9 years (MNI=3). Although the
sample size is admittedly small, there is an apparent correlation between age group and
seasonality. The Locality II dentitions suggest a seasonally scheduled utilization
strategy, with older, five to nine year olds procured during the winter and spring, while
younger individuals were taken more often during the spring, summer and fall of the year
of their birth.

27

The fragmentary nature of the assemblage also hinders the determination of sex
composition. Because of the lack of measurable specimens for any one element
remaining intact enough to offer a meaningful sex ratio, no attempt was made to
determine a sex composition for the Locality II Agate Basin faunal materials. However,
visual inspection suggests the presence of several large adult males within the collection.
In addition, a number of decidedly smaller specimens are also present. Unfortunately,
these observations are made across elements, not within a group of the same elements
and as such, any quantification of this patterning is impractical.
Duration of Occupation
For the purpose of the following analysis, I interpret the Locality II Agate Basin
faunal remains as representing a palimpsest of occupations. Several observations support
this assumption. In many units, the original excavators were unable to separate the upper
and lower Agate Basin layers. Further, in several units the upper-most Midland and
lowest Agate Basin materials could not be differentiated. In addition, season of death
information derived from bison dentitions identifies individuals with tooth eruption and
wear indicative of mortalities during all seasons (Rapson and Niven 2000b), suggesting
that either a long-term occupation or more likely, a series of multiple reoccupations are
represented at the site. Finally, Rapson and Niven’s (2000b) examination of dentition
from Locality II identified two specimens belonging to the same individual (specimen
numbers UWII-7465 and UWII-7459), one noted in the field notes as Agate Basin and
the other as part of the Hell Gap component. The assignment of two specimens from the
same individual to different components indicates either intermingling of the cultural

28

deposits, errors in the assignment of component designations in the field or errors during
Irwin’s (1967) dissertation analysis.
Excavation and Curation Biases
Methods employed during excavation and curation can impart significant biases
into a sample that can influence any later analysis and subsequent interpretation (Rapson
and Niven 2000a, Sellet 1999). In the case of the Hell Gap investigations, biases may
have been introduced into the collection through two agents. The first concerns errors in
provenience designation that may have later resulted in specimens being assigned to the
wrong cultural components. The second potential source of bias is the selective discard
of faunal specimens by the Harvard excavators. Because reconstructing the Locality II
stratigraphy from field notes is an extensive problem in itself (e.g. Sellet 1999), I will not
attempt to resolve any of the potential problems with provenience nor will I attempt to
rectify any of the potential biases introduced through recovery and curation. Given the
partial and inadequately documented nature of the assemblage, I will instead outline what
is available for study and in the following chapters make conditional arguments
concerning the potential Paleoindian behaviors suggested by the extant collection.
Provenience Issues
Analysis of the Locality I data revealed a number of problems with vertical
provenience (Sellet 1999:112-115). Sellet found that within the Harvard field notes that a
number of units were recorded as having been excavated twice in terms of elevation.
Inspection of the Locality II field notes suggests that these excavations are likewise
plagued with depth of excavation issues and reveals a number of agents that potentially
introduce bias into the collection I analyze. For example, Bradley (1966), the project

29

excavation supervisor, identified a systemic error in vertical provenience from the 1965
datum on the last day of excavations in 1966. This error includes both upward and
downward errors in vertical measurements north and south respectively of the 26-south
line. However, Bradley notes that all excavation depths were systematically in error and
were consistent with the depths recorded for at least the previous year, suggesting that
although absolute elevations may be in error, deposits identified as Agate Basin were
done so consistently. While the provenience issues recorded in the Harvard field notes
should not have impeded Irwin’s ability to assign specimens to the appropriate cultural
components, knowledge of provenience problems indicates that the mixing of specimens
from different cultural components during the multi-season Harvard excavations is not
impossible.
The renumbering of grid squares and the change from six foot to three foot
excavation units during the 1964, 1965 and 1966 field seasons (Field Notes 1966)
introduces an additional level of ambiguity, making deciphering the notes for units
excavated over a period of years difficult. Further, during the 1962 field season a number
of units were excavated with bulks between them that were removed during the 1963
excavations (Field Notes 1966). Mistakes in vertical provenience at this point may have
resulted in the mixing of materials from different components. In addition, Irwin (1966),
in a note dated March 14, 1966, states that cultural levels
were placed on maps in the laboratory during the winter of 1965-66.
They are the best that could be determined from the profiles and the
maps themselves. Lumping rather than splitting was done because it
was almost impossible to separate out any other than the major cultural
divisions. This was due to the fact that the stratigraphy, although not
complicated, is by no means flat and level. As a result, the surfaces
dug often cut across as many as three major cultural levels and many
micro stratigraphic levels.
30

Irwin’s statement suggests that the faunal remains were not assigned field numbers, and
instead, appear to have been collected by a unit-level provenience into level bags by unit,
and later assigned a cultural complex.
Finally, the Hell Gap collection contains a large sample of faunal material lacking
any provenience (Locality X, n=430) and these items may belong to any one of the Hell
Gap localities (Rapson and Niven 2000a). Sometime between the end of excavations in
1966 and their acquisition by the University of Wyoming in 1995, the Locality X
specimens became separated from their provenience information, if they ever were
assigned provenience data. Bison upper forelimb and lower rear limb elements, in
addition to a number of atlas and axis vertebrae, dominate the Locality X materials
(Rapson and Niven 2000a).
Selective Discard
An additional factor potentially biasing my analysis is the selective discard during
the 1960s excavations of bone specimens deemed unimportant because they were small,
fragmentary, or non-diagnostic. The discard of faunal specimens by excavators is
apparent. Numerous entries are present in the field notes stating that small, fragmentary
specimens while point plotted on field maps, were “not saved” (Field Notes 1966), but
instead thrown away. In order to evaluate the extent of the selective discard, the number
of specimens now present in the UW Hell Gap assemblage from rows 6 east, 9 east and
12 east were compared with the number of specimens recorded in the Harvard field notes
as saved for analysis (Table 2.4, Figure 2.7). Comparison between the present sample and
the sample represented in the field notes reveals that the number of specimens currently
available from only one unit (2% of those sampled) is consistent with the field notes,

Table 2.4 Table comparing the number of items now present in the Locality II Agate Basin faunal
assembalge with the number recorded in the field notes as saved.

while 72% (n=33) of the sampled units are missing specimens recorded as saved by the
excavators. In addition, 26% (n=12) of the units contain more specimens than are
identified in the field notes. I suggest that the documented overrepresentation of faunal
materials may result from a number of factors including but not limited to, a failure to
record faunal materials in the notes, damage to the assemblage that greatly increased the
number of fragments between initial recovery and the present analysis, and finally and
most likely, the lumping of multiple small specimens under one field number.
Unfortunately, because of the vague and imprecise nature of the Harvard
Expedition records, evaluating these models for the collection’s excavation and curation
history is not possible. Given the obvious bias suggested by the comparison between
numbers of recorded and curated specimens, in addition to the problems identified
concerning provenience, the analysis and interpretations drawn from the Hell Gap
33

Locality II faunal materials must be viewed with caution. However, although a large
number of specimens have been deleted from those originally present, inspection of the
photographic record taken at the time of excavations suggests that in general, the larger,
diagnostic specimens are all currently present in the collection. As a result, I suggest, but
cannot demonstrate, that inclusion of the items deleted during recovery might not change
the following analysis significantly.
For the purposes of my thesis, I include specimens identified by Irwin in the
original and amended field notes as belonging to the Agate Basin component. Because of
the problems with provenience (vertical and horizontal) and the selective deletion of
specimens in combination with a lack of comprehensive documentation for the
assemblage, reassessing the provenience of each specimen is beyond the scope of this
research. However, examination of unit profiles recorded at the time of excavation
indicates that cultural levels were often identified as dense paleosoils containing large
quantities of charcoal, bone and chipped stone debris separated by sterile deposits. In
addition, the depths recorded for the Agate Basin component consistently follow a slope
from north to south (Figure 2.8, Appendix 2). All things considered, I suggest that Irwin
during the process of his dissertation research was probably best equipped to determine
the cultural association of any specimens in the collection.
Given the caveats presented in Chapter 2, I proceed with my analysis by reporting
on what is today present in the assemblage. All inferences derived from the Locality II
Agate Basin faunal remains must be recognized as conditional on the sample today
available for analysis, one that may or may not be a biased sample of the faunal materials
introduced into the Locality II deposit during the Agate Basin occupation.

Summary
I begin Chapter 2 by describing the setting and immediate environment of the
Hell Gap Site, suggesting that Locality II may have been an ideal camp site close to a
number of important resources. The history of the Harvard excavations was briefly
outlined. The locality was excavated from 1961 to 1966, resulting in the identification of
Midland, Hell Gap, Agate Basin and Lusk artifacts. The Locality II Agate Basin
component faunal assemblage is described as consisting almost entirely of bison remains,
although a limited number of deer (Odocoideus sp.) and pronghorn (Antelocarpa
americana) remains are also present. Seasonality and season of death information
derived from bison dentitions suggests that Locality II was occupied during all seasons
and that older, five to nine year olds were procured during the winter and spring, while
younger individuals were taken more often during the spring, summer and fall of the year
of their birth. I continued by identifying potential problems with the existing collection
as including provenience issues and selective deletion of small, fragmentary or nondiagnostic specimens discarded during the Harvard excavations. Finally, I conclude that
because of the uncertain nature of the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage, the results of
the analysis presented in the following chapters must be accepted as conditional on what
is today available for study.

36

CHAPTER 3
SKELETAL PART FREQUENCIES: ANALYSIS AT THE ASSEMBLAGE LEVEL
I begin evaluating the Hell Gap Site Locality II Agate Basin faunal materials by
conducting an assemblage level analysis. In Chapter 3, I employ models explaining the
differential survivorship of skeletal parts to investigate the formational history of the
Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage. I do not appraise individual specimen
attributes (bone modifications) in the present chapter. A specimen level attribute analysis
is instead the focus of Chapter 4. In Chapter 3, I explore three taphonomic processes
potentially conditioning the assemblage, density-mediated destruction, carnivore
ravaging and human transport. For each taphonomic agent, I describe observed
patterning between skeletal part frequencies and utility, bone volume density or
actualistic studies focused on carnivores.
Skeletal Element Frequencies and Utility Indices: Models for Interpreting
Archaeological Faunal Remains
Binford’s (1978) ethnoarchaeological study of the Nunamiut of northern Alaska
resulted in a series of models quantifying transport and utilization decisions in relation to
anatomical differences in skeletal part utility. In an effort to understand Nunamiut
transport and processing decisions, Binford (1978) butchered and then measured the
comparative meat, marrow and white grease utilities of two sheep and a caribou.
Binford’s (1978) studies resulted in the construction of three indices, the meat index, the
bone marrow index and the grease utility index and these he used as the foundation for
modeling Nunamiut subsistence behaviors. However, because procurement sites for
caribou were never the primary consumption locations for Nunamiut prey, Binford
(1978:72) suggests decisions made at kill sites are,
37

generally made in terms of transport decisions rather than in terms of
different potential uses for anatomical parts. The hunter having decided
how to butcher the animal, is simultaneously deciding whether to abandon
some parts and transport others. The more extended the logistical system
is, the more multidimensional the decision making at the point of
procurement will be. The butcher’s interest is in which parts of the animal
are best for the greatest variety of uses.
The idea that the Nunamiut based transport decisions on a generalized assessment of an
element’s potential utility resulted in the construction of the modified general utility index
(MGUI; Binford 1978:74). The MGUI describes the “relative economic importance by
rank ordering of elements according to the by-weight proportion of attached meat,
marrow, and grease” (Thomas and Mayer 1983:367). The MGUI acknowledges the
transport of sets of elements as a single package. Thus, the MGUI takes into account the
transport of low ranked items, termed “riders” such as carpals and tarsals that normally
articulate with higher ranked elements, such as the radius or tibia, by boosting their utility
values to compensate for their presence in an assemblage as a function of transport while
attached to high ranked elements (Binford 1978:74).
Binford (1978:81) defines several transport strategies based on curves describing
the relationship between %MAU and MGUI. Bulk utility strategies (Binford 1978:81)
describe transport decisions maximizing quantity and are characterized by the selection
of large numbers of moderate to high utility skeletal parts while low utility parts are
discarded at an accelerating rate relative to utility (Figure 3.1a). In contrast, gourmet
utility strategies (Binford 1978:81) reflect transport decisions maximizing quality and
represent choices selecting for high quantities of items with the highest utilities, while
discarding those of moderate to low utility (Figure 3.1b). Finally, an unbiased utility
strategy (Binford 1978:81) describes the transport of items in direct proportion to their

relative economic utilities (Figure 3.1c). Conceptually then, all other things being equal,
because different stages in the cultural system encompassing butchering and processing
are expressed through different behaviors they should leave archaeological deposits with
differing and often complementary utility curves (Thomas and Mayer 1983:368). Simply
put, “at a kill site, one will find a proportionally large sample of low utility elements; at a
meat cache or residential site, one finds a large sample of high utility elements” (Thomas
and Mayer 1983:369).
Although faunal researchers continue to develop utility indices as interpretive
tools (for example Rodgers 2000a), these models must be employed with caution.

39

Ethnoarchaeological studies demonstrate that hunter-gatherers do not always transport
food packages from kill to residential base locations in accordance with specific measures
of nutritional utility (Bartram 1993; Bunn et al. 1988; O’Connell et al. 1988, 1990). Nonnutritional concerns can and often do condition the transport of skeletal elements and
subsequently the selective deletion or introduction of skeletal parts into archaeological
deposits. Under certain conditions, modern hunter-gatherers have been observed
maximizing the amount of edible tissue relative to transport and processing costs
(Bartram 1993; O’Connell et al. 1988, 1990). In addition, hunting or transport parties
may take advantage of a lack of competition for the highest ranked parts while away from
the residential base by eating the best items and returning lower ranked items to the
residential base (O’Connell et al. 1988). Further, a range of presently unidentified
cultural and/or environmental variables may result in a lack of correlation between
skeletal parts and utility in an archaeological assemblage (Bartram 1993; O’Connell et al.
1990). For example, present day participants in the world economy rarely make food
choices exclusively based on utility. Because of the potential for a variety of factors
including non-utility based decisions to influence transport, ethnographically derived
utility indices should be recognized as models for decision making based on rational,
quantifiable variables functioning to provide analytical frameworks for research.
However, utility indices produce results that can be readily compared with data from
other assemblages, and as such, I suggest that they offer the best (but imperfect) tools for
evaluating the Locality II Agate Basin component bison remains.

40

Volume Bone Mineral Density
Lyman and others (Grayson 1988, 1989; Lyman 1984, 1985, 1991, 1993, 1994)
demonstrate that density-mediated destruction as a function of the volume bone mineral
density of skeletal elements can obscure evidence of a given utility strategy within an
assemblage and if not properly controlled, can lead an investigator to incorrect
conclusions. For example, many elements demonstrating high structural densities have
lower economic utility than those with lower structural densities (Grayson 1988).
Therefore, an assemblage primarily conditioned by density-mediated attrition can look
much like an accumulation of low utility skeletal parts discarded at a kill/processing area.
The potential for similar patterns to result from one or more taphonomic agents
introduces a measure of equifinality that requires resolution before the analyst can draw
any meaningful conclusions (Lyman 1994:258). According to Lyman (1984) and
Grayson (1988), lack of positive correlation between structural density and %MAU in an
assemblage suggests that density related attritional processes are by themselves unlikely
to account for any observed patterning. However, assemblages displaying positive
relationships between density and %MAU are extremely ambiguous. Although several
researchers propose statistical correlation-based solutions (Grayson 1988:70; Rogers
2000a, 2000b), such approaches are best employed as one of several complementary
analytical tools.
Carnivore Modification
In this section, I outline the research of Blumenschine and Marean (1993), who
suggest that ratios of long bone epiphyses to long bone shaft fragments can successfully
evaluate the intensity of carnivore activity affecting a faunal assemblage. Blumenschine

41

and Marean (1993), through a series of actualistic experiments augmented with
previously available data, derive a model for differentiating faunal assemblages
conditioned solely by carnivores from those resulting from human processing or from
bone accumulations resulting from both human and carnivore actions. I employ the
following model to assess the extent of carnivore modification to the Locality II Agate
Basin component faunal materials. Blumenschine and Marean (1993:274) suggest that
“the feeding activities of one agent will influence the range of choices available to the
other and, hence, the extent and nature of damage and dispersal of remaining bones and
bone portions.” Because carnivores, like humans, are expected to select skeletal parts in
order of decreasing nutritional utility, if a carcass is first processed by humans and then
utilized by carnivores, then the carnivores are faced with a different set of feeding options
than those found at a carnivore kill. In effect, processing by humans re-ranks the
nutritional utility of a set of skeletal parts.
Blumenschine and Marean (1993) suggest that the re-ranking of skeletal parts can
be seen in the ratio of limb epiphyses to shaft fragments. Human processing often aims
to remove fat-rich marrow from within long bone shafts. The bone breakage involved in
opening marrow cavities frequently results in a number of shaft fragments in addition to
disassociated long bone epiphyses. Here the skeletal part’s nutritional value becomes reranked and carnivore feeding strategies change. Carnivores often chew through long
bone epiphyses both to access grease contained within long bone cancellous tissues and
to open marrow cavities for marrow extraction. Bones previously processed for marrow
thus become nutritionally unattractive and though epiphyses may still contain some

42

nutrient value, their destruction by carnivores subsequent to human processing is
expected to decrease.
To test their model, Blumenschine and Marean (1993) assessed the data from a set
of experimental assemblages (Blumenschine 1988; Blumenschine and Selvaggio 1991;
Marean et al. 1992; Marean and Spencer 1991) to monitor the change in epiphysial
destruction relative to shaft fragment survivorship between carnivore only, hammerstone
only (bone destruction through marrow processing) and assemblages patterned by both
carnivores and humans. Their experiments recorded skeletal part summaries resulting
from the feeding behaviors of both captive and wild hyenas. Blumenschine and Marean
(1993) found that the ratio of epiphyses to shaft fragments increases from carnivore only
assemblages to dual patterned assemblages and finally is highest for hammerstone only
assemblages (note that this model applies only if articular ends are not being
preferentially destroyed through some cultural process such as bone grease processing).
In addition, for the dual patterned, simulated assemblages, bones left in a fat-rich
condition (marrow cavities intact) had lower epiphyses/shaft ratios than those left in fatdepleted conditions. Not only are fat-rich bones more likely to be deleted through
ravaging at a kill site, but they are often also removed from areas of active feeding by
carnivores attempting to avoid competition over choice items (Blumenschine and Marean
1993:282). Blumenschine and Marean’s (1993) results suggest that the ratio of articular
ends to shaft fragments can offer important insights into a faunal assemblage’s
formational history.

43

Skeletal Part Analysis of the Locality II Agate Basin Component Faunal Materials
In Chapter 2, I state that portions of at least fourteen individual bison were
introduced into the Agate Basin deposits at Locality II based on dentition. The relative
frequencies of skeletal elements as measured by %MAU (Table 3.1) suggests that
skeletal elements were not introduced into the site in the same proportions found in a
complete bison. Inspection of the relative skeletal part frequencies indicates the
representation of appendicular elements at much higher proportions than axial elements
(Figure 3.2).
Within forelimb elements, proximal portions are in general, better represented
than distal portions. Distal humeri are most common, distal ulnae are least common and
with the exception of humeri, proximal portions of upper forelimb elements are better
represented than distal portions (note that for the remainder of this discussion, proximal
and distal refer to halves of elements).
Elements of the hindlimb display a pattern similar to the one described for
forelimb elements. Innominates (os coxae) are poorly represented, distal femora are
more common then proximal femora, and both proximal and distal portions of the tibia
are represented in approximately equal quantities. While astragali and calcanii are
represented in similar quantities to distal tibiae, suggesting their introduction into the
deposit as riders, tarsals are in comparison poorly represented. In contrast to
appendicular elements, the assemblage contains low frequencies of axial parts. Only
atlas and mandible portions approach the frequencies of the higher utility limb elements.

The central question to be answered in the following analysis can be simply
stated, why are bison skeletal elements differentially represented? Do the skeletal
element frequencies identified in the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage result primarily
from human decisions regarding the relationship between utility and transport or does this
pattern represent a significant degree of selective deletion by non-human taphonomic
agents? Further, if the impacts of non-cultural agents can be shown as insignificant, do
the identified skeletal part summaries reflect aspects of nutritional decision making on the
part of Late Pleistocene hunter-gatherers occupying the Hell Gap Site ca. 10,000 years
ago? In the remainder of Chapter 3, I evaluate the questions presented here by comparing
the skeletal elements frequencies present in the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains
with volume bone mineral densities values (Kreutzer 1992), element portion based
measures of carnivore ravaging (Blumenschine and Marean 1993), and finally with a
series of bison nutritional utility indices (Emerson 1990, 1993).
Density Mediated Attrition
In the present section, I evaluate the influence of density-mediated attrition on the
Locality II Agate Basin bison (body size 4) assemblage. Following Lyman’s (1984,
1985) recognition that bone density can influence the survivorship of skeletal parts,
volume bone mineral densities for bison skeletal parts (Kreutzer 1992) are employed to
evaluate differential survivorship within the assemblage. Density values employed here
represent the scan site closest to each portion or landmark used to establish MAU values,
using separate values for proximal and distal halves where appropriate (Table 3.2).

Volume Bone Mineral Density (Table 3.2)
Figure 3.3 Relationship between %MAU and values for bison bone mineral density.
Density values taken from Kreutzer (1992).

Comparing %MAU values with volume bone mineral densities indicates that
there is no correlation between skeletal part survivorship and density values (Table 3.3a;
Figure 3.3). Throughout the assemblage, element portions with similar densities display
widely variable %MAU values. For example, while both thoracic vertebrae and proximal
tibiae have similar density values, .42 and .41 respectively, thoracic vertebrae are only
36% as common as proximal tibia (%MAU=100). As a further example, the relative
frequencies of carpals and tarsals demonstrate (mean density values of .43 and .65
respectively) that several denser and therefore more likely to survive elements are
underrepresented relative to less dense elements. The lack of a positive correlation
between %MAU and survivorship suggests that volume bone mineral density does not,
49

by itself, account for the differential representation of skeletal parts within the Locality II
Agate Basin assemblage.
Carnivore Modification
Following the model proposed by Blumenschine and Marean (1993), I now
evaluate the intensity of carnivore ravaging potentially modifying the Locality II Agate
Basin faunal remains. In order to eliminate the potential for the overrepresentation of
shaft fragments relative to epiphyses, only specimens identifiable to element are included
here. Calculation of the relationship between epiphyses and shaft fragments results in a
ratio of 0.41 epiphysis fragments to each long bone shaft fragment, placing the Locality II
Agate Basin assemblage closest to Blumenschine and Marean’s (1993) result for
hammerstone only modified assemblages (Table 3.4, Figure 3.4).
I do not suggest that carnivores did not selectively delete skeletal parts from the
assemblage. Because only specimens identifiable to element are included, the result
presented here may over-represent the number of epiphysis fragments relative to shaft
fragments, at least to some extent. In fact, if unidentified long bone fragments are
included in the calculation, then the ratio changes dramatically, dropping to 0.12, well
within the expected range for carnivore only assemblages. However, as the specimen
level attribute analysis conducted in Chapter 4 will show, long bone specimens display
little evidence of carnivore modification, while at the same time indicating intensive,
patterned human processing interpreted as marrow extraction. In sum, it is likely the
Locality II Agate Basin faunal remains were conditioned primarily by humans, but also to
some extent by carnivores.

Skeletal Part Summaries and Utility Indices
In this section, %MAU values for skeletal parts (Table 3.1) are compared with
five of Emerson’s (1990, 1993) measures of bison nutritional utility (Table 3.2).
Emerson (1990) derived carcass composition data from four range-fed bison, a yearling
male, a seven year old male, a seven year old female and a sixteen and one-half year old
female. The Total Products Model ([S]MAVGTP, Table 3.2), measures the general
utility of the combined caloric yield of skeletal fat, muscle protein, and intramuscular and
other dissectible fat (Emerson 1990:624). The Total Fat Model ([S]MAVGTF, Table
3.2) is derived from the caloric yields of skeletal, intramuscular and dissectible fat,
excluding the stomach and intestinal depots (Emerson 1990:842). The Skeletal Fat Model
([S]MAVGSKF, Table 3.2) measures the caloric yields of the combined marrow and
grease, within-bone fat content (Emerson 1990:843). The Marrow Fat Model
([S]MAVGMF, Table 3.2) assesses the relative caloric yields of skeletal elements based
on marrow alone (Emerson 1990:839). Finally, the White Grease Model ([S]MAVGWG,
Table 3.2) describes the caloric yields based solely on the white bone grease contained in
bison long bones (Emerson 1990:840). All of the indices employed during this analysis
are standardized on a scale from zero to one hundred and are modified to account for
riders.
Total Products Model. Comparison of skeletal part summaries with the Total
Products Model (Figure 3.5) suggests that skeletal portions were not introduced into the
Locality II Agate Basin deposit based on generalized nutritional utility. Elements
representing most of the highest Total Product utilities, ribs, vertebrae, and innominates,
are underrepresented. Correlation coefficients indicate no relationship between the Total

Products Model and the bison assemblage (Table 3.3b, Figure 3.5). Because of the
under-representation of axial elements, whether through excavator bias or because axial
elements were treated differently than appendicular elements, analysis was repeated for
appendicular elements only (Marean and Frey 1997:709). Upon removal of axial
elements from consideration, a visible pattern emerges and a statistical correlation is
present (Table 3.3c; Figure 3.6). The appendicular skeletal parts conform to a bulk
transport model as proposed by Binford (1978:81) that appears to maximize the
combined total protein and total fat values found attached to bison limb bones. If
generalized return rates did not dictate the transport of bison skeletal parts, both axial and
appendicular, then what did influence the return of elements from kill sites to Locality II?

Total Fat Model. Comparison of Locality II bison skeletal portion frequency data

identified between %MAU and the Total Products Model, elements representing most of
the highest overall fat utilities, the ribs, vertebrae, and innominates, are underrepresented
(Figure 3.7). Skeletal part summaries inclusive of both axial and appendicular elements
show no correlation with the skeletal part fat utilities for bison (Table 3.3d, 33e). While
removing appendicular elements from consideration does little to improve the level of
statistical correlation, a visible pattern does emerge (Figure 3.8). The appendicular
element frequencies suggest a bulk transport strategy (Binford 1978:81) that appears to
maximize the combined overall values for the caloric yields of skeletal, intramuscular

and dissectible fat found attached to bison limb bones. Here again, the question arises;
why or how might high utility axial elements have been deleted from the assemblage?
Skeletal Fat Model. The positive correlation between the Locality II, bison
element frequencies and the Skeletal Fat Model suggests the introduction of skeletal parts
into the deposit may in some sense be related to within-bone fat utility (Table 3.3f, Figure
3.9). The relationship between skeletal fat and element frequency describes a weakly
defined unbiased utility strategy (Figure 3.9). Overall, skeletal part frequencies appear
consistent with their introduction into the deposit in proportion to within-bone fat content
values. Removal of axial elements has little effect on either the visible pattern or the
statistical correlation, suggesting that skeletal fat values may be influencing the transport
of food packages from kill sites to the inferred residential base (Table 3.3g, Figure 3.10).

However, because of the vagueness of the pattern, another factor or some subset of
skeletal fat, for example marrow or bone grease, may be conditioning this pattern.
Marrow Fat Model. Comparison of the Locality II Agate Basin bison element
frequencies with the Marrow Fat Model indicates a positive correlation, suggesting that
skeletal portions were introduced into the Locality II Agate Basin deposit, at least in part,
based on their marrow fat utility (Table 3.3h, Figure 3.11). Much like the patterning
identified between %MAU and the Skeletal Fat Model, the relationship between bison
element frequencies and marrow suggests an unbiased utility strategy (Binford 1978:81).

frequencies with the White Grease Model also indicates a correlation between grease

utility and %MAU (Table 3.3i, Figure 3.12). In fact the relationship between bison
skeletal parts and white grease utility appears most similar to a bulk utility strategy
(Binford 1978:81), suggesting that elements/portions high in white bone grease were
actively selected for transport. However, I do not suggest that Paleoindians were making
transport decisions based solely on grease utility. Such a conclusion would be surprising
indeed, as I am aware of no evidence indicating bone grease processing facilities
associated with Paleoindian-age deposits. I offer a much simpler answer. Comparing the
White Grease Model with the Marrow Fat Model reveals a pattern very similar to the one
present when evaluating %MAU against the White Grease Model (Table 3.3j, Figure
3.13). Thus, all other things being equal, if skeletal parts are introduced into a deposit in
59

direct proportion to marrow utility values, then at the same time, the relationship between
%MAU and white grease will describe a bulk utility curve. Simply stated, there is a close
correlation between marrow fat and white grease-rich portions of a bison skeleton.
Summary
The preceding discussion monitors the extent that three taphonomic processes,
density-mediated attrition, carnivore ravaging and hunter-gatherer transport decisions
may have conditioned the survivorship of skeletal part frequencies introduced into the
Hell Gap Site Locality II Agate Basin deposits during a complex, multi-dimensional
formational history. The lack of correlation between survivorship and volume bone
mineral density suggests that density-mediated attrition, by itself, cannot account for the
differential survivorship of skeletal parts. Likewise, carnivores appear to have had little
impact on the extant assemblage, although deletion of elements through removal beyond
the excavated margins of the site by scavengers may have been more significant. The
Locality II, faunal remains do suggest a relationship between within-bone fat content and
element representation, if taphonomic processes not addressed in this thesis have not
acted on the assemblage to any significant degree. A number of alternative scenarios
such as deletion through fluvial action (the site is located in a drainage bottom) or the
extensive conditioning of the assemblage through selective discard during the Harvard
excavations must be recognized as potentially effecting the skeletal element frequencies
now present. In the next chapter, I will further explore the Locality II, faunal assemblage
through a specimen level attribute analysis to support the conclusions derived from the
skeletal part frequencies.

60

CHAPTER 4
BONE MODIFICATIONS: ANALYSIS AT THE SPECIMEN LEVEL
Modeling the survivorship of skeletal parts through density mediated attrition,
ravaging and utility together suggests that the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage may
have been conditioned, at least in part, by the decisions of hunter-gatherers transporting
food items in relation to nutritional value. However, correlation between two sets of
variables does not necessarily identify the cause of a pattern. Further, the Locality II
deposit likely results from a complex, multi-dimensional formational history. I suggest a
complementary analysis is needed to evaluate the patterning offered by the assemblage
level analysis conducted in the previous chapter.
Butchery and Processing: Evidence at the Specimen Level
In Chapter 4, I will assess the bone modifications observed on individual
specimens in an attempt to evaluate both ravaging and human processing as agents
potentially conditioning the faunal remains. Up to this point, I have argued that the
relationship between element representation and nutritional utility indicates that human
action is the most likely agent responsible for the Locality II Agate Basin faunal
assemblage. Specifically, my analysis indicates an emphasis on anatomical portions
offering the greatest combined bulk protein/within-bone fat utilities, suggesting that
Agate Basin Paleoindians may have been practicing a fat-seeking feeding strategy.
I will pursue support for the interpretations drawn in Chapter 3 through
investigations in three areas. First, individual specimen attributes should reflect butchery
aimed at reducing whole bison into transportable and consumable food packages. If
appendicular elements were being preferentially exploited, then butchery related

61

cutmarks should be present on limb elements. Second, inspection of individual
specimens should reveal damage consistent with processing designed to recover bone
marrow. Third, if Paleoindians are primarily responsible for the Locality II Agate Basin
faunal materials then the assemblage should display little evidence of carnivore
modification. Together, the expectations outlined here if supported, would greatly
strengthen the conclusions drawn from the skeletal part frequency analysis.
Assemblage Condition
The condition of the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains is generally poor,
most likely obscuring a number of bone surface modifications. Three factors may hide
butchery and processing marks, carnivore damage and other subtle, humanly or nonhumanly generated modifications. First, many of the specimens exhibit extensive and
significant surface damage, stemming from haphazard excavation techniques. The
Harvard field notes make frequent reference to the use of picks and carpenter’s hammers
during excavation (these tools are visible in photos taken at the time). In addition, many
of the specimens appear to have been cleaned with a wire brush. Second, a thick varnishlike preservative, now yellowed with age, was frequently applied to bone specimens in
the field. In this case, bone surfaces were not destroyed, but are instead now completely
obscured. Third, subaerial weathering has significantly modified bone surfaces and in
many cases, cortical surfaces are completely absent. The advanced weathering may
reflect the Locality II Agate Basin deposit’s formational history. However, the
destruction of bone surfaces may also result from 1960’s excavation practices dictating
exposure of “bone levels” covering large areas of excavation grid. As a result, many
specimens may have lay exposed to the elements for periods of up to a month before

62

recovery and curation. Because of the uncertainty as to when the specimens were
weathered, I do not attempt weathering analysis for the Locality II assemblage. Lack of
weathering data is unfortunate. Weathering information can greatly aid in determining
the contextual association of assemblages (Byers 2000; Todd and Rapson 1999), a tactic
that for Locality II might have allowed for the separation of the upper and lower Agate
Basin components in the units where these deposits merged, allowing for a more finegrained interpretation of the deposit.
Carnivore and Rodent Modification
Rodents, especially porcupines, are known to gnaw on dry, degreased bone, often
leaving a readily identifiable configuration of multiple grooves that are “relatively broad,
flat-bottomed or slightly rounded in cross section, and parallel or nearly parallel to each
other” (Fisher 1995:40). Twenty-three (1.8%; Table 4.1) of the bison (body size 4)
specimens show rodent modification and several suggest extended or repeated episodes
of gnawing. One specimen displays both cutmarks and rodent gnawing, indicating the
modification of part of the assemblage by both humans and rodents (Figure 4.1).
However, given the frequency of observed rodent modification, rodents had little impact
on the survivorship of the skeletal parts present in the Locality II Agate Basin faunal
assemblage.
Carnivore Ravaging
Only one specimen (less than .1% of the body size 4 specimens; Table 4.1, Figure
4.2), the distal, medial portion of a humerus, exhibits unambiguous evidence of carnivore
gnawing. In addition to the single, carnivore modified specimen, several others display a
pattern of selective deletion highly suggestive of ravaging by large canids (Binford 1981;

Haynes 1980). Portions consistently missing from the Locality II assemblage include
proximal ends of the humerus, femur and tibia (Figure 4.3a). Proximal articular ends of
long bones are often targets for carnivores due to the bone grease within their cancellous
tissues. The destruction of articular ends by scavengers also allows access to the marrow
cavities (Binford 1981:51; Haynes 1980:345-347). Ravaging often results in long bone
specimens whose proximal ends are missing (Figure 4.3b), appearing gouged or
scalloped, while distal condyles may display some gnaw marks (Haynes 1980). As such,
long bone ends will suffer the greatest relative attrition in a ravaged assemblage. In
addition to patterned attrition inflicted through ravaging, carnivores can modify an
assemblage while leaving few (if any), often subtle marks on bone surfaces, if they leave
any modifications at all, (Blumenschine and Marean 1993:280). Further, because
marrow extraction by humans often leaves only articular ends as attractive to carnivores
and because ravaging often destroys cancellous portions, the lack of direct evidence for
carnivores can be particularly acute in the case of a dual patterned assemblage

67

(Blumenschine and Marean 1993:282). The Locality II specimens, while not consistent
with the expectations for an extensively ravaged assemblage, suggest limited
conditioning of the Locality II Agate Basin faunal remains through canid activity.
Cultural Bone Modifications
The Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage contains evidence for the
butchering and processing of bison parts by Paleoindians. The Locality II Agate Basin
bison remains were inspected for green bone breakage, cutmarks, and impact damage.
Green bone fractures are one indicator that a specimen may have been processed for
within-bone nutrients either by humans or carnivores (Haynes 1983, Johnson 1985).
Green bone breakage results from dynamic loading on fresh bone and is often manifested
as spiral fractures with fracture surfaces having “the same color as the outer cortical
surface, exhibit a smooth texture, and form acute and obtuse angles with the outer cortical
surface” (Johnson 1985:176). However, because non-human taphonomic processes can
also produce spiral fractures (Agenbroad 1989; Behrensmeyer et al. 1989; Oliver 1989),
green bone breakage should not, by itself, be viewed as evidence of marrow extraction.
Cutmarks (bone surface modifications associated with butchery) are defined as
fine, parallel to sub-parallel striations with v-shaped profiles resulting from the removal
of muscle from associated skeletal elements (Shipman and Rose 1983:64). Chopmarks
are another surface modification observed (on a single specimen) in the Locality II Agate
Basin bison assemblage. A chopmarks is defined as “broad, relatively short, linear
depression that generally has a V-shaped cross section” (Fisher 1995:19). In general,
chopmarks are expected to be much more robust modifications resulting from a hacking
as opposed to cutting motion with a butchering tool.

68

Conchoidal flake scars on long bone shaft fragments are important clues to the
formational history of a faunal assemblage. Fisher (1995:21) reports that
conchoidal flake scars and corresponding bone flakes are produced by
applying strong force to a bone with a hard object. Ancient humans
created conchoidal flake scars and flakes by striking the shaft of a
bone with a hammerstone (or other suitable hammer) or by striking a
bone on an anvil. The purpose of hitting bones in this fashion was, in
many cases, to break bones open for marrow removal, to fashion an
implement from bone, or to obtain a piece of bone as raw material for
tool manufacture or other purposes.
Fresh or green bone is somewhat elastic. Because of its inherent elasticity, green bone
responds to the application of force in much the same way as toolstone, resulting in
similar fracture patterns to those observed in the manufacture of stone tools (Binford
1978:154). Conchoidal fractures and conchoidal flakes possessing platforms and
negative bulbs of percussion (Figure 4.4), characterize impacts to bone specimens (Fisher
1995:21). For the purposes of this thesis, two types of conchoidal flake scars are noted,
inner conchoidal flake scars and outer conchoidal flake scars (White 1992:135). Flake
scars on inner cortical surfaces are suggested to represent impacts by hammerstones or
other similar tools, while flake scars on the outer cortical surface are suggested to
represent anvil damage created as the force of impact travels through the bone from the
opposite aspect, detaching a flake on the outer cortical surface resting against the anvil.
While Late Pleistocene bison were obviously much larger than caribou and therefore may
have required processing behaviors not employed by recent hunter-gatherers, I assume
that bone modifications generated by the Nunamiut are consistent with strategies
designed to process megafaunal bison for two reasons; 1) for the purpose of comparison
and 2) because Binford’s (1978, 1981) study of Nunamiut subsistence offers the most
complete documentation of hunter-gatherer butchery in a temperate environment.

Bone Modifications within the Locality II Faunal Assemblage
The Locality II Agate Basin faunal materials were monitored for green bone
breakage, cutmarks, and impact modification in the form of conchoidal flake scars and
anvil damage. Green bone breakage is common within the assemblage. Of the bison
sized specimens, 27.8% (NISP=362) of the total assemblage and 65.9% (NISP=326) of
the long bone specimens display green bone fractures, and while these can result from
ravaging (Haynes 1983), the lack of unambiguous carnivore modification suggests this
pattern reflects primarily human processing for within-bone nutrients. None of the body
size 3 specimens display characteristics of cultural modification. However, for bison
(body size 4) remains 8.5% (NISP=110, Table 4.1) exhibit either cutmarks or impact
flake scars. The low overall frequency of modifications may result, in part, from the poor
surface condition of many of the specimens. Conversely, the lack of butchery related,
bone modifications might indicate a lack of damage to cortical surfaces during
dismemberment and defleshing. Although the overall frequency of modifications is low,
sufficient evidence exists to make some statements about human butchering and
processing behaviors. In the remainder of Chapter 4, I will argue that the placement of
observed cutmarks and conchoidal flake scars on Locality II Agate Basin bison
specimens is consistent with the processing of limb elements for within-bone nutrients.
Cutmarks
Examination of the Locality II Agate Basin bison assemblage reveals that 2.3%
(NISP=30, Table 4.1) of the bison size specimens display cultural surface modifications.
Cutmarked axial elements include mandibles, ribs, thoracic vertebrae and lumbar
vertebrae. One mandible displays cutmarks on its lateral ascending ramus (Figure 4.5).

According to Binford’s observations of Nunamiut butchers (1981:109), such cutmarks
represent the disarticulation of the mandible from the cranium.
Two fragmentary rib specimens exhibit sets of multiple cutmarks on the lateral
aspect of their proximal blades (Figure 4.6). Ethnoarchaeological observations associate
similarly placed modifications with the removal of the longissimus (Binford 1981:113).
A third rib specimen shows a single mark on the medial aspect of the neck, directly
below the tubercle. This modification is similar to those associated with the
disarticulation of the ribs from the vertebrae (Binford 1981:113).
Three sets of cutmarks were noted on vertebrae. One thoracic vertebra displays a
series of marks directly below the caudal articular process (Figure 4.7a). Observations of

Nunamiut butchers suggest that similar marks result from the disarticulation of the ribs
from the vertebral column. Two lumbar vertebrae (Figure 4.7b) exhibit cutmarks related
to the removal of the longissimus muscle (Binford 1981:113). One set of cutmarks is
located on the dorsal/cranial border of the transverse process near the centrum and the
other set of cutmarks is located on the right ventral surface of the centrum.
Elements of both the forelimb and hindlimb display surface modifications
consistent with butchering. One scapula exhibits a series of cutmarks on the lateral
aspect of the supraglenoid tuber (Figure 4.8a). Binford (1981:121) suggests that
cutmarks around the glenoid represent the disarticulation of the scapula from the humerus
and associates such modifications with secondary butchery operations conducted at

disarticulation of the humerus from the radius. Three distal shaft fragments exhibit
cutmarks, one on the lateral aspect of the shaft and two on the cranial surface. No
cutmarks were observed on the radius, ulna or metacarpal.
Several hindlimb specimens show evidence of surface modification. One ilium
fragment exhibits cuts and chopmarks on the dorsal lateral aspect near the acetabulum
(Figure 4.8b). Similar marks are suggested to represent the disarticulation of the femur
from the acetabulum (Binford 1981:114). A single, caudal mid-shaft fragment of a femur
is cutmarked directly above the supracondyloid fossa (Figure 4.10). Based on their

location mid-shaft, this set of marks suggests meat removal before marrow extraction
(Binford 1981:116-119). Three tibia shaft fragments (Figure 4.11) display modifications
consistent with filleting as described by Binford (1981:131-132). Two sets of cutmarks
are present on distal, lateral shaft portions and a third is located on a caudal, medial midshaft fragment. One distal, lateral metatarsal shaft fragment displays cutmarks (Figure
4.12). Finally, one second phalanx (not illustrated) exhibits cutmarks on its caudal, axial
aspect, a pattern associated with the skinning of the foot (Binford 1981:126).
Conchoidal Flake Scars and Marrow Processing
Conchoidal flake scars are common modifications (6.1%, NISP=80; Table 4.1) to
the Locality II bison (body size 4) long bone specimens (Figure 4.4). Although marrow

processing produces conchoidal flake scars, carnivore ravaging and other non-human
agents will at times, produce similar modifications to long bone fragments
(Behrensmeyer et al. 1989; Oliver 1989). However, several observations suggest that
conchoidal flake scars present on Locality II Agate Basin bison specimens result from
human processing and not ravaging. First, as shown above, although the selective
deletion of humerus, femur, and tibia proximal ends suggests some level of carnivore
modification, little direct evidence of ravaging is available. Second, ethnographic
observations suggest that regular patterns of breakage will result from the cultural
modification of skeletal elements to obtain within-bone food products (Binford 1978:154;
Yellen 1977:293). As I will show in the remainder of Chapter 4, conchoidal flake scars
identified in the Locality II Agate Basin assemblage conform to a regular pattern of bone
breakage in both location and frequency.

78

In addition to the lack of observed carnivore damage, three further sets of
observations support the cultural origin of conchoidal flakes scars within the Locality II
Agate Basin faunal assemblage. The first results from a comparison with data from two
other investigations, the second from an intra-assemblage comparison of the relative
intensity of processing at the element level, and the third from direct observations of
impact damage. For the total Locality II Agate Basin bison (body size 4) faunal
assemblage, 5.6% (NISP=73) of the specimens exhibit conchoidal flake scars (Table 4.1).
The frequency of impact fractures becomes much more significant when compared only
with long bone fragments. Binford (1981:164-165) found that overall for six long bone,
marrow–cracking experiments, 16.3% (NISP=154) of the resulting epiphysial and shaft
fragments over 29 mm in length exhibit at least one impact fracture. Employing this
model, Jodry and Stanford (1992:120) found a similar percentage, 17.5% (n=28), of the
long bone fragments from the Stewart’s Cattle Guard Folsom Site display impact related
damage. A similar analysis of the Locality II Agate Basin bison assemblage reveals that
17.2 % (NISP=71) of the long bone fragments over 29 mm show at least one conchoidal
flake scar. As such, the frequency of impact marks in the Locality II Agate Basin
assemblage is consistent with both the results of actualistic experiments and data from
another Paleoindian-age residential camp suggested as the site of processing for withinbone nutrients (Jodry and Stanford 1992).
Evaluating the relationship between intensity of processing and fat utility further
supports the purposeful extraction of within-bone nutrients. Assuming conchoidal flake
scars represent marrow processing-related impacts, I suggest that the effort invested in
processing a bone should correlate with a particular element’s marrow content. Here,

79

intensity of processing is measured by the number of conchoidal flake scars divided by
the MNE for each long bone. When compared with Emerson’s (1993:144) Marrow Fat
Model for whole bones, this ratio indicates a correlation (Spearman’s rank-order r2 of
0.714 at the .05 confidence level) between the intensity of processing and the value of
within-bone fat content, suggesting that the effort invested in processing limb elements is
related to their within-bone fat contents. (Table 4.2, Figure 4.13).
Conchoidal Flake Scars: Placement and Patterning
Although conchoidal flake scars are relatively common throughout the
assemblage, the only axial element displaying impact damage is the mandible (Figure
4.5). Two specimens display breakage consistent with marrow processing (Binford
1978:149; Yellen 1977:29). Both conchoidal flake scars are located on the medial aspect,
one on the ascending ramus directly caudal to the tooth row and the second directly
above the distal border. The lack of axial elements with conchoidal flake scars is not unexpected given their under-representation in the Locality II Agate Basin bison
assemblage combined with the fact that axial elements are not high in within-bone
nutrients.
All upper forelimb elements, with the exception of the scapula, show signs of
marrow processing, with the majority of the evidence concentrated on upper limb
elements. The humerus displays the greatest number of conchoidal flake scars and
appears to be the most heavily processed of the forelimb elements (Figure 4.9). Binford
(1981:162) observed that among the Nunamiut, caribou humeri were often placed medial
face down on an anvil, and struck on the upward facing lateral aspect because this
orientation placed the bone in a stable position. Experimentation with comparative

specimens from the University of Wyoming faunal collection indicates that a medial face
down position is also stable for bison humeri. The location of conchoidal flake scars on
the Locality II bison humeri are for the most part consistent with the Nunamiut data on
marrow extraction. Conchoidal flake scars cluster on mid-shaft fragments of both the
medial (n=4) and lateral aspects (n=7). Specimens representing the proximal shaft of the
humerus exhibit only two conchoidal flake scars, both located on the caudal aspect. Four
conchoidal flake scars are present on distal portions, two on the caudal aspect directly
above the oleceranon fossa and two on fragments representing the cranial and lateral
aspects of the distal humerus. In addition to the impact-produced flake scars, one
humerus lateral mid-shaft fragment exhibits probable anvil damage.
In general, ethnoarchaeological data suggest that impacts to the radius target the
proximal and distal shafts in an effort to expose the marrow cavity (Binford 1981:162;
Yellen 1977:293). Specimens representing the radius-ulna show modifications consistent
with marrow processing (Figure 4.14). All observed conchoidal flake scars lie either on
cranial (n=2) or caudal (n=4) shaft fragments and tend to be located towards either
proximal or distal ends of the shaft. In addition, two specimens display anvil damage.
One of the anvil marks is located on a specimen representing the lateral, proximal aspect
of the radius shaft (specimen #8470, Figure 4.14). The second is located on the cranial
aspect of the shaft, and is paired with a conchoidal flake scar observed on the caudal
aspect of the same shaft fragment (specimen # 8420, Figure 4.14). One distal ulna shaft
fragment displays two conchoidal flake scars, one each to the lateral and medial aspects
of the articulation with the radius.

Only one specimen representative of the lower forelimb exhibits evidence of
processing for marrow (Binford 1981:159). In general, carpals and phalanges are intact
and display no evidence of processing, however a conchoidal flake scar is present on the
caudal aspect of a single, mid-shaft, metacarpal specimen (Figure 4.12a). The lack of
modifications to lower limb elements probably reflects both their low overall total
products and within-bone nutritional utilities.
The elements of the rearlimb also show signs of human processing. Observations
by Binford (1981:159-162) of Nunamiut marrow processing reveal that impacts to
rearlimb elements are often directed at proximal and distal shafts in an effort to open the
83

marrow cavity. Modifications to upper hindlimb specimens within the Locality II Agate
Basin faunal assemblage are consistent with the ethnoarchaeological data and account for
the majority of the observed conchoidal flake scars. Femur fragments display conchoidal
flake scars on the medial (n=4), lateral (n=3), cranial (n=2) and caudal (n=1) aspects,
clustering either towards the proximal (n=5) or distal (n=5) ends of the shaft (Figure
4.10). Two anvil fractures are present, one on the distal, lateral aspect of the shaft and
the other on the distal, caudal aspect of the shaft (specimen # 8478 and 9064, Figure
4.10). Each is paired with an impact flake scar on the opposing aspect of the shaft.
Tibia specimens also display both impact and anvil damage suggesting efforts to
open the marrow cavity by detaching proximal and distal ends (Binford 1981:161-162).
Damage to the tibia appears highly patterned (Figure 4.11). All impacts to the medial
aspect (n=4) cluster near the proximal end of the shaft. Both of the impacts observed on
the lateral aspect tend towards the proximal end of the shaft and are located in
approximately the same place. One fragment of distal tibial crest exhibits impact damage
(specimen # 8336, Figure 4.11). Fragments representing the caudal aspect evidence two
impacts, one towards the proximal end of the shaft and the other towards the distal end.
Finally, two examples of anvil damage were recorded, one to the distal-most anterior
crest (specimen # 8834, Figure 4.11) and the other to the distal, lateral portion of the shaft
(specimen # 8057, Figure 4.11).
The final element indicating processing for within-bone nutrients is the
metatarsal. Much like the lower forelimb, bones of the lower hindlimb show few
indications of marrow removal, and calcanii and astragali display no signs of processing
at all. Two conchoidal flake scars are present on metatarsal specimens and both of these

84

are found on the lateral aspect, one is mid-shaft and the other is near the distal end
(Figure 4.12b).
Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the specimen level attributes of the individual Hell
Gap Site Locality II Agate Basin bison specimens. An overview of assemblage condition
was offered and I suggest that the overall degraded condition of bone surfaces may
obscure evidence of modifications that were at one time present. The observations
presented in this chapter suggest that, although poorly represented, ravaging may have
had some small part in conditioning the survivorship of bison skeletal parts during the
deposit’s formational history. Human modifications, both ancient and recent appear to be
the major agents affecting the assemblage. Human bone surface modifications suggest
that meat packages were stripped of meat, disarticulated and finally processed for marrow
at some time during their trajectory from mortality site to inclusion in the Locality II
deposit. The findings of the attribute based analysis support the conclusions drawn in
Chapter 3, suggesting the importance of fat, as well as meat protein to the diet of the
Agate Basin Paleoindians.

85

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION
In the preceding chapters, I argue that an assemblage of high fat and meat protein
utility skeletal parts dominate the Hell Gap Site Locality II Agate Basin bison materials.
Given my analysis, skeletal fat appears to have conditioned the accumulation of faunal
remains at Locality II, a pattern requiring explanation. I begin Chapter 5 by discussing
the importance of fat to the hunter-gatherer diet and continue by outlining models of
hunter-gatherer subsistence for use as an inferential framework. I conclude by
synthesizing the discussions of fat utility and hunter-gatherer subsistence behavior with
dentition-based mortality profiles, skeletal element frequency data, and observed bone
modifications, to reconstruct food procurement strategies potentially responsible for the
Locality II Agate Basin bison assemblage.
Paleoindians, Protein and Fat in Seasonally Variable Environments
Given that the axial elements under-represented in the Locality II assemblage
offer some of the highest generalized utilities, the apparent emphasis on items with lower
overall utilities but higher skeletal fat utilities represents an interesting pattern. A number
of publications have discussed the importance of fat to hunter-gatherers subsisting on
protein intensive diets (Speth 1983, 1987, 1989, 1990; Speth and Spielmann 1983; Stiner
1991, 1994, Todd 1991). While animal resources can provide extremely high return rates
relative to pursuit and processing costs, reliance on protein can, under certain
circumstances, lead to nutritional deficiencies in a forager’s diet (Speth and Spielmann
1983:2). Ungulates suffer seasonal fluctuations in fat as measured by percent of body
weight. Fat depots are depleted in a regular, seasonally scheduled sequence from late fall

86

into late spring, beginning with back fat, proceeding to fat depots within the body cavity,
while within-bone fats are depleted last (Speth 1987:20). Males are in their worst
condition in late fall and female nutrition is poorest in late spring. In a review of
accounts of historic explorers and trappers, Speth and Spielmann (1983:3) conclude that
a diet composed largely of lean meat (i.e., mainly protein with small
amounts of fat), even in quantities that would appear to satisfy caloric
requirements, can result in serious nutritional problems. Hunters
apparently were keenly aware of the deleterious effects of a lean-meat
diet, and, when possible, abandoned lean animals for fatter ones, even
when they were short of food.
The human body requires energy to digest and metabolize food products. In the
context of lean meat, either animal fat or carbohydrates (plant foods) are required to
metabolize protein without incurring a net caloric loss during digestion. Speth and
Spielmann (1983:6) suggest, from an overview of the nutritional processes of protein
metabolism, that “heavy or complete reliance on fat-depleted meat would have elevated
the total energy needed to support a group of hunters at a time of year when total caloric
intake was very likely to have been restricted.” As a result, hunter-gatherers can expend
more calories during digestion than the meat they are eating provides, and as such can
starve even while consuming large quantities of lean bulk protein.
Speth (1987; Speth and Spielmann 1983) proposes two strategies to increase fat
availability during periods of reliance on lean meat that are useful within the context of
Paleoindian hunter-gatherers. First, hunter-gatherers may practice increasingly selective
procurement and processing of animals with high fat content, concentrating on the
consumption of fat-rich skeletal parts in winter and spring. Second, hunter-gatherers can
accumulate excess body fat reserves by consuming all available fat during periods of
nutritional plenty for prey species (Speth 1987:20; Speth and Spielmann 1983:18-19).
87

The first option is the most consistent with the evidence provided by the Locality II
Agate Basin bison remains. Given the nutritional requirements of subsisting on bison
during the lean months, it is not surprising that the Locality II Agate Basin Paleoindians
appear to have returned to the residential base anatomical portions (limb elements)
maximizing the amount of within-bone fat available to digest the attached bulk protein
(Figure 5.1). However, a preference for exploiting high marrow utility elements does not
explain the over-representation of head parts relative to axial elements observed in the
Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage.
I suggest that because Emerson (1990) did not fully evaluate the fat utility of head
parts, and because I compare %MAU values with her data, that the information presented
in Figure 5.2 may not fully reflect the relationship between fat utility and head part
frequency in the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage. Stiner (1994:228) suggests,
“that the distribution of fat tissues in the ungulate anatomy is more complex than marrow
fat indexes predict. A closer look at the nature and physiological distributions of fat
bearing tissues in the prey anatomy reveals why this is so.” Two types of fat tissues are
present in ungulates. Up to this point, I have discussed the distribution and seasonal
variability of metabolizable fat, unstable fat that is stored and used in accordance with
food availability (Stiner 1994:228). The second fat type is called structural fat (Stiner
1994:228). Structural fats are stable, once structural fat depots develop within an
individual they are never depleted and if they are this usually implies the demise of the
animal.

Table 5.1 Fat and protein content of cranial and post-cranial tissues of
adult domesticated cattle per 100 g unit. Table modified from Stiner
(1994:229, Table 8.1).

Head parts are the main repositories of structural fats in the ungulate anatomy.
Neurological tissues, specifically myelinated nerve fibers, soft tissues concentrated in the
brain, are sheathed in structural fats (Stiner 1994:228). In fact, the ratios for fat to protein
in head organs of domestic cows (employed as a proxy measure for ungulates) are in
general as high as prime-health muscle tissue fully stocked with muscular fat (Table 5.1).
Because structural fats do not fluctuate with the overall nutritional fitness of an animal
they are “more constantly available to foragers because, with the exception of the
mandibular marrow cavity, the food value of the cranium and upper neck region is most
similar in healthy and starved prey” (Stiner 1994:228). Nunamiut food preferences
support the importance of head parts as fat sources. Binford (1978:149-151) reports that
the Nunamiut displayed the greatest preference for cranial tissue during the spring, the
season when metabolizable fat reserves would be in their worst condition. Finally, head
parts require a high level of processing to extract fat relative to limb elements and as such
I suggest that they can be expected to have been transported to a central processing area if
they were being exploited for structural fat (Stiner 1994:228). Given the high fat utility
of head parts, the apparent over-representation of crania and mandibles identified in the

90

Locality II Agate Basin faunal materials (Figure 5.1) is fully consistent with an emphasis
on maximizing the amount of fat available for consumption.
The suggestion that hunter-gatherers may accumulate excess body fat as an overwintering strategy offers additional insight into the formational history of the Locality II
faunal materials. If the post-cranial faunal remains are accepted as representing the same
range of seasonality as suggested by the dentition (an assumption made with caution due
to the time-averaged nature of the deposit), then extensive processing for within-bone fat
appears to have occurred regardless of the season or prey nutritional status (Figure 5.2).
While the selection of fat-rich skeletal parts is not surprising for late winter and spring,
the emphasis on within-bone fat is somewhat unexpected for the summer and fall months
when prey should have been available with ample muscular fat to metabolize the
associated protein without sufficient net caloric loss.
The pattern of intensive processing may represent a Paleoindian fat-seeking
feeding strategy in response to long-term environmental change. The Agate Basin
Complex persisted on the Northwest Plains towards the end of the Pleistocene/Holocene
transition (Frison 1999:268). Paleoenvironmental reconstructions of Late Pleistocene
environments for both the Agate Basin Site (Walker 1982) and the Hell Gap Valley
(Reider 1999) suggest a period of decreasing moisture occurred during or immediately
after the Agate Basin occupations at both locations. During the Late Pleistocene,
Paleoindian hunter-gatherers on the Northwestern Plains were most likely faced with not
only seasonal fluctuations in both the availability of floral resources (carbohydrates) and
the overall nutritional status of animal prey (fat-depletion), but also variations in the
availability of these critical resources resulting from long-term climate change.

91

Figure 5.2 Photographs showing the consisted fragmentation patterns for distal femur shaft
fragments (top) and distal tibia articular ends (bottom). The examples illustrated here are
indicative of the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains that in general demonstrate, regardless of
element, a consistent level of intensive processing for within-bone nutrients.

92

Environmental changes may have resulted in periods of year-round nutritional stress for
bison populations, and as such Agate Basin Paleoindians can be expected to have adapted
the exploitation of bison not only to seasonal variability but also to long-term changes in
prey nutritional state. If true, then the archaeological record should reflect such
adaptations. If Paleoindians are viewed primarily as mobile foragers adapted to large
body size faunal resources (Kelly and Todd 1989), then the storage of food resources as a
hedge against either seasonal or long-term shortfalls is unexpected. Although Frison and
Stanford (1982:79) argue for the caching of meat at the Agate Basin Site, no evidence is
present for the storage of food items at Locality II during the Agate Basin occupations.
Given the lack of evidence for storage at Locality II, the consumption of fat whenever
available with the goal of accumulating body fat reserves may have been an adaptation to
a highly mobile lifeway in an environment characterized by seasonal or long-term
episodes of reliance on fat-depleted meat.
Subsistence Organization
Understanding the importance of fat to hunter-gatherer diets in combination with
the data derived from the Locality II Agate Basin faunal materials allows for some
inferences to be drawn concerning Paleoindian behavior. Binford (1980) suggests that
mobile hunter-gatherers organize their settlement systems around subsistence through
strategies ranging from foraging to collecting. Here, I employ Binford’s forager-collector
continuum as a framework for understanding the subsistence and settlement organization
of the Paleoindians responsible for the creation of the Locality II Agate Basin faunal
assemblage. Foraging is characterized by high residential mobility, encounter based
food-getting behaviors (for the purposes of this discussion defined as the hunting of

93

dispersed animals “encountered” while foraging), and relatively immediate consumption
(Binford 1980:9). In this case, foraging activities begin and end daily at a residential
base, defied as the “hub of subsistence activities” (Binford 1980:9). In contrast,
collecting represents a much different strategy. Logistically organized subsistence
behaviors define collectors. For example, logistically organized hunter-gatherers can be
expected to conduct planned hunts of multiple animals with an end goal of producing
surpluses for storage. In addition, logistical hunting parties may extensively process
animal resources before returning a readily consumable product to the base camp
(Binford 1980:10). The forager and collector models are not suggested to represent polar
extremes exclusively employed by hunting and gathering groups, but are instead offered
as “organizational alternatives which may be employed in varying mixes in different
settings” (Binford 1980:19).
Agate Basin Complex Subsistence Practices in Eastern Wyoming
If Agate Basin Paleoindians occupied the Hell Gap Valley for reasons other than
subsistence (for example the ease of access to high quality toolstone in combination with
favorable campsites with reliable water), than they would have needed to adapt their
food-getting behaviors to the location. Given that the Locality II deposits represent a
palimpsest of occupations, the recovered faunal materials most likely represent a longterm, time averaged picture of several different Paleoindian subsistence strategies. Here I
combine the discussion of fat-based nutrition with Binford’s (1980) forager-collector
continuum to outline two (but by no means all) food-getting patterns potentially
responsible for the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage in response to a settlement
strategy emphasizing the location of residential camps in relation to non-food resources.

94

First, dentition-based mortality profiles and bone modifications provide evidence
suggesting the creation of the Locality II Agate Basin faunal assemblage by groups of
hunter-gatherers in part employing the encounter hunting of dispersed bison. Mortality
profiles can provide important insight into a faunal assemblage’s formational history.
Previous research defines several age based mortality profiles (Klein and Cruz-Uribe
1983, 1984; Voorhies 1969). An attritional mortality profile is dominated by young
individuals, often newborns, and old age individuals, while prime age individuals are
under-represented (Voorhies 1969:23). Attritional profiles are generally associated with
scavenging from natural mortality sites or a predation strategy concentrating on weak or
inexperienced prey, most likely the very young or the old and sick (Klein and Cruz-Uribe
1983:70). Catastrophic mortality profiles characterize assemblages representing all age
groups as might be expected to exist in a living population (Voorhies 1969:23).
Catastrophic mortality profiles are most consistent with mortality events killing entire
populations or within a hunter-gatherer context, large multiple person hunting parties
taking groups of prey individuals representative of the age makeup of a greater
population in a single procurement event (Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1983:70).
Population data based on dentitions should be viewed with caution. At present,
the taphonomy of teeth is poorly known (Marean 1995:67). Both the differential
survivorship of dentition and the differential transport of head parts can bias a mortality
profile. Unfortunately, no actualistic data is presently available for the density-mediated
attrition of teeth. Further, dental elements are subject to the uncertainties generated by
the selective discard and lack of provenience of a significant portion of the assemblage

identified in Chapter 2. Given the extant assemblage, I interpret the Locality II Agate
Basin component dentition conditionally on what is available for study.
The Locality II Agate Basin component bison dentitions suggest that at least the
crania and mandibles of primarily very young or older adult individuals were regularly
returned to Locality II (Rapson and Niven 2000a). The population data outlined here
most closely resembles an attritional mortality profile (Figure 5.3). Binford’s (1980)
model for subsistence behavior, in combination with current knowledge of Paleoindian
hunting technology, offers a potential explanation for the presence of an attritional
mortality profile. Within a hunter-gatherer context, I suggest that an attritional mortality
profile implies encounter-based behaviors representing a foraging-based subsistence
organization.

96

Foragers often set out as single individuals or in small groups to procure dispersed
game encountered while foraging (Binford 1980). If the immediate area of the Hell Gap
Valley was not frequented by aggregated bison herds or if the Agate Basin Paleoindians
favored the occupation of Locality II at times when Late Pleistocene bison were
dispersed (if they did seasonally aggregate and disperse like modern bison), then in order
to exploit the available population, Paleoindian hunters pursuing game on an encounter
basis would have been forced to widen their prey selection breadth to include not only
large adult bulls but also less desirable older adults and smaller juvenile individuals.
Further, because Paleoindian hunting technologies, thrusting spears and atlatl (Frison
1992:167), require the hunter to close within a short distance of the prey and then fully
expose him or herself while throwing a projectile, animals unaccustomed to hunting
pressure (young individuals) or in weakened states (older individuals) may have been
easier to procure for single or small groups of hunters. Finally, seasonality data
indicating occupation during the late spring, summer and early fall months suggests that
because meat could not be frozen for consumption at a later date, that any bison procured
during these seasons were most likely done for relatively immediate consumption.
The assessment of bone modifications offers a second body of data supporting a
foraging-oriented subsistence organization. Assuming the Hell Gap Site Locality II
Agate Basin component represents a series of residential bases (Irwin et al. 1973) and the
Locality II Agate Basin Paleoindians were organized as foragers, then the accumulation
of faunal remains should represent the full range of animal resource processing
behaviors. The placement of cutmarks on the Locality II Agate Basin faunal specimens
suggests the return of limb elements to Locality II for defleshing and then preparation for

97

marrow processing, while impact-related breakage indicates intensive, assemblage-wide
processing for within-bone nutrients. Taken as a whole, the patterned nature of bone
modifications is fully consistent with the expectations for a residential camp.
Given an apparent emphasis on the consumption of fat, the frequencies of bison
skeletal parts introduced into the Locality II deposit can also be interpreted as suggesting
a foraging strategy designed to maximize both bulk protein and skeletal fat. Confronted
with the prospect of transporting the remains of large prey such as bison, portions
returned to Locality II may have been predicated on the number of carriers available for
transport (O’Connell et al 1988, 1990). Hunting parties consisting of a few, or possibly a
single individual, would be faced with maximizing net caloric returns in relation to
transport costs. One way to maximize return rates would be to transport only meat
packages offering the greatest overall nutritional utilities. However, anatomical portions
offering the highest Total Products (Emerson 1990) values are under-represented in the
Locality II Agate Basin assemblage. Instead, the Hell Gap Agate Basin Paleoindians
appear to have shifted their utility decisions to emphasize fat at the expense of
generalized utility. As I have shown previously, skeletal parts maximizing within-bone
fat values dominate the assemblage, and as such support a fat-seeking subsistence model
suggesting that when faced with transport constraints, high fat utility items were most
likely those returned to Locality II.
Because the Locality II Agate Basin component skeletal part summaries
characterize a palimpsest of occupations, they may also indicate periodic logistical
hunting events. If Locality II represents one of a number of dispersed, contemporary
activity/living areas in the Hell Gap Valley (Hofman 1994:352), then the sample

98

evaluated in the previous chapters may reflect only a small portion of a greater
assemblage transported from a relatively distant, multiple animal kill event. Here again,
the return of primarily high skeletal fat utility items to the Hell Gap Valley may be a
function of the relationship between return rates and transport costs. In this case
however, the selective transport of limb elements may have been based on the distance of
the procurement location from the residential base. O’Connell et al. (1988, 1990) found
that among the Hazda, the number of elements returned to the residential base was often
inversely proportional to the distance from camp to kill. If the Locality II Paleoindians
were faced with transporting multiple carcasses from a distant procurement event, they
may have chosen to return only those skeletal parts highest in both meat and high fat
utility. In this scenario, an accumulation of limb elements can be expected to result. I do
not suggest that meat products associated with axial elements were not utilized, only that
if exploited, axial meat packages may have been processed at the procurement site to
remove associated skeletal elements in an effort to increase return rates relative to
transport costs.
Summary
In Chapter 5, I synthesize dentition based mortality profiles with the analyses of
skeletal part frequencies and bone surface modifications, in combination with research
into seasonally scheduled changes in prey nutrition fitness to evaluate the subsistence
organization of the Paleoindians responsible for the Locality II Agate Basin deposits.
The subsistence behaviors inferred from the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains
suggest a feeding strategy designed to maximize the amount of fat included in the diet,
most likely in response to a diet dependant on lean meat. In addition, I argue that based

99

on the extant assemblage, several subsistence patterns may be represented. First, the
analyses presented in my thesis suggest that the Agate Basin occupants of Locality II may
have organized themselves as foragers who practiced an encounter-based hunting
strategy, resulting most often in the procurement of yearling or old-age individuals.
Second, the Locality II Agate Basin faunal remains may represent anatomical portions
returned from a mass kill event, but because the excavation block represents one of a
number of dispersed living areas only a small portion of a larger assemblage is available
for study. Unfortunately, a third scenario must be recognized. Prime-age individuals are
present in the Locality I faunal remains (Rapson and Niven 2000a) and as such the lack
of prime-age adults from the Locality II remains is curious. The lack of prime-age
animals may be a result of some combination of inadequate documentation, selective
discard, and loss of specimens or specimen provenience during curation and handling
(resulting in the Locality X assemblage).

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS
The goal of this thesis was to evaluate Agate Basin bison exploitation through the
assessment of both skeletal part frequencies and bone modifications. Based on the
available sample, I suggest that the Locality II Agate Basin bison remains result from
hunter-gatherers practicing a feeding strategy designed to maximize the amount of fat
included in their diet. Unfortunately, my analysis also indicates that the extant
assemblage may have been significantly biased through mistakes in provenience and
selective deletion of specimens during excavation. The potentially biased nature of the
Locality II faunal assemblage (see also Rapson and Niven 2000a, 2000b), in combination
with the suggestion of a little known Paleoindian subsistence pattern, together call for
further research into the food-getting strategies practiced by Paleoindians inhabiting the
Hell Gap Valley.
A New Glimpse of Paleoindian Subsistence: A Fat-Seeking Feeding Strategy
The results presented in my thesis contrast with the inferences drawn from the
published data on the Agate Basin Complex, suggesting that Locality II represents a
previously unidentified portion of a larger Paleoindian settlement pattern. The Locality II
Agate Basin bison remains suggest a very different bison procurement strategy than the
one proposed for the Agate Basin Site (Frison and Stanford 1992). Frison (1992: 164170; Frison and Stanford 1982:79) suggests that procurement activities at the Agate Basin
Site centered on communal hunting designed to provide not only for immediate
consumption but also to produce a food surplus as an over-wintering strategy. Further, a
dramatically larger population of prey animals (MNI=75; Zeimans 1982:227), a mortality
profile favoring prime-age adults in combination with limited, winter seasonality (Frison

1982:250, 252-253) all indicate a procurement strategy unlike the one proposed for the
Locality II Agate Basin Paleoindians.
In addition to the dissimilarity with the Agate Basin Site, my analysis also
suggests a pattern markedly different from the presently available picture of Paleoindian
subsistence. Specifically, the emphasis on the procurement of high fat utility skeletal
elements and the subsequent extraction of bone marrow reflected by the Locality II Agate
Basin bison remains does not follow the current expectations for Paleoindian subsistence
behavior. Todd (1991:218) argues that Paleoindians practiced a “fat-indifferent” use of
bison procured during the winter. Todd (1991:224) suggests Paleoindian did not place
an emphasis on within-bone nutrients based on three lines of evidence:
(1) skeletal element frequencies indicating either limited bone
removal [from kill sites] or non-segmental removal of entire limb
units (Todd 1987a), (2) a relatively low percentage of definitely
cutmarked and humanly fractured bones, and (3) paucity of
processing features or those associated with long-term use of
stored of cached meat products.
While no features consistent with processing or storage were recorded at Locality
II, the results presented in my thesis do not fully conform to the other elements of Todd’s
(1991) model. The assemblage I evaluated indicates that limb bones (and head parts)
where commonly removed from carcasses and transported to the residential base.
Unfortunately, the analyzed remains cannot be associated with any know kill sites and as
such the frequency of element transport cannot be evaluated relative to the number of
prey individuals present at a procurement event. The Locality II Agate Basin bison
remains do show an unambiguous and relatively high degree of human modification.
Although my visual inspection recognized few cutmarks, the assemblage displays a
frequency of conchoidal flake scars that cannot be considered a “relatively low
102

percentage” (Todd 1991:224). I do not suggest that previous investigators have
misinterpreted the available data, only that given the analysis presented in my thesis that
the Locality II Agate Basin faunal remains indicate a poorly known aspect of Paleoindian
adaptation.
Paleoindian Settlement Systems: The Other Side of the Spectrum
In addition to suggesting a little know pattern of bison exploitation, the analyzed
Agate Basin sample suggests a previously unrecognized aspect of a larger Paleoindian
settlement system. Many of the better known Northwestern Plains Paleoindian localities
represent kill events involving multiple prey animals associated with butchery/processing
locations in the immediate area (Frison 1974, 1996; Frison and Stanford 1982; Frison and
Todd 1987). Such a pattern suggests that following the procurement of multiple bison,
the residential base was moved to the kill site for the utilization of animal products (Kelly
and Todd 1988).
Locality II may represent a much different pattern, offering insight into the
opposite end of the spectrum of Paleoindian settlement. Stanford (1999:315) suggests
that the Agate Basin Complex may represent a migration from the west of “generalized
foragers, adapted to ecotonal environments, who ventured out onto the Plains only during
periods of high bison populations or for occasional communal hunts.” Paleoindians may
have resided in the Hell Gap Valley as a strategy to maximize access to a number of
resources, both food and nonfood. The subsistence behaviors outlined in my thesis may
represent the adaptation of food-getting behaviors to the location as opposed to the betterrepresented strategy of adapting location to procurement (Frison 1974, 1996; Frison and

103

Stanford 1982; Frison and Todd 1987), and as such are consistent with Stanford’s (1999)
model.
The Locality II assemblage can also be interpreted as being consistent with the
provisioning of a dispersed aggregation of Paleoindian family groups occupying the Hell
Gap Valley and surrounding drainages. Hofman (1994:351) suggests that site locations
with diverse, predictable resources (wood, lithics, diverse fauna, or protective settings)
rather than mobile and sometimes unpredictable resources such as bison, may have
dictated the placement of Paleoindian aggregation sites. Given Hofman’s (1994) model,
the Hell Gap Valley offers an ideal location for the aggregation of Paleoindian groups. If
Locality II is one of a number of dispersed contemporary camps occupied during an
aggregation of Paleoindian bands, then both the encounter based and logistical bison
procurement strategies outlined in Chapter 5 would be consistent with the provisioning of
aggregated bands located with preference to location over availability of bison resources.
My thesis demonstrates that new and important insights into Paleoindian
subsistence and lifeways can be derived from extant collections that were often neither
excavated nor curated to modern standards. Through careful evaluation of hypotheses
using complementary analyses, in combination with models of hunter-gatherer behaviors,
previously unavailable windows into past lifeways can become available. The results of
this thesis offer one such set of conclusions. Further, the subsistence and settlement
patterns suggested here are generally unlike those previously documented for
Paleoindians. Much of this is most likely due to the nature of the Hell Gap Site deposits.
While most Paleoindian faunal research has focused on highly visible kill sites, few
Paleoindian residential camps have been investigated. Thus, careful research employing

104

the Hell Gap Site materials offers a unique opportunity to evaluate Paleoindian lifeways,
while at the same time complementing the existing body of knowledge.
