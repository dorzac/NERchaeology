This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on 1,394 acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright
Patman in East Texas for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, in advance of proposed
timber harvesting. In compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was
conducted so that cultural resource sites would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archaeological fieldwork was conducted during March and April, 2009, and included a 100 percent pedestrian survey
accompanied by 1,030 shovel tests. Thirty tests were positive, including 28 on sites and two isolated tests.
Recovered artifacts included prehistoric lithic flakes, one projectile point, prehistoric and historic ceramics, metal,
and glass. Artifacts will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Nine archeological sites were recorded. Five sites (41BW755, 41BW758, 41CP251, 41CP492, 41CS339) are
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work
is warranted. Four sites (41BW756, 41BW757, 41BW759, 41CS333) could not be clearly assessed and their eligibility
is unknown. These sites should be avoided and protected. If they cannot be protected, they should be further
investigated to clearly determine their NRHP eligibility.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,394 Acres at Wright Patman Lake and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Abstract
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted on six separate tracts of land, totaling 1,394 acres, in
Cass, Bowie, Marion, Camp, and Upshur counties in East Texas. The project area includes
1,029 acres in three inventory parcels at Wright Patman Lake and 365 acres in three parcels
at Lake O’ the Pines. Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office
of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE
has proposed timber harvesting within the parcels and, in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural
resource sites located on the parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the
undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted in three sessions: March 18–27, April 1–10, and
April 20–24, 2009. Fieldwork included a 100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by
intensive and systematic shovel testing. Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm)
archeologists manually excavated 913 shovel tests as a discovery tactic and placed an additional
117 shovel tests on sites or around isolated positive shovel tests for delineation. Of these 1,030
shovel tests, 30 tests were positive, including 28 positive tests on sites and two isolated positive
tests. EComm archeologists recovered artifacts such as prehistoric flakes, a projectile point,
prehistoric and historic ceramics, metal, and glass. All subsurface artifacts were collected and
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Nine archeological sites were investigated, including two previously recorded sites and seven
newly discovered sites. All nine sites were fully documented, although one previously recorded
site was negative for cultural resources. Of these nine recorded sites, four sites could not be
clearly assessed using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, and five sites are considered
not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The NRHP eligibility of sites 41BW756, 41BW757, 41BW759, and 41CS333 is unknown.
These sites should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected,
these sites should be further investigated to clearly determine eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP.
Sites 41BW755, 41BW758, 41CP251, 41CP492, and 41CS339 are assessed as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP and no further work is warranted.

Project Description
1.1 	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Wright
Patman Lake and 9,251 acres at Lake O’ the Pines (acreages are outside conservation pools).
Much of this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction
with the existing management plans for the several reservoirs and in accordance with accepted
silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for selective
timber thinning. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not
clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface,
but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P. L. 89–665
et seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted on lands owned by the
federal government and managed by the USACE.

1.2 	Location
The project area is composed of six separate parcels located at Wright Patman Lake in Cass
and Bowie counties and Lake O’ the Pines in Marion, Camp, and Upshur counties, Texas.
Together, the seven parcels total 1,394 acres and range in size from 43 acres (Highway 59 East
parcel at Wright Patman Lake) to 523 acres (Bassett Creek parcel at Wright Patman Lake). The
six parcels are listed in Table 1-1.

Project Description

1.2.1 	 Wright Patman Lake
Wright Patman Lake is on the Sulphur River about 18 kilometers (km) southwest of Texarkana
in Bowie and Cass counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend
into Morris, Titus, and Red River counties. Initially known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake
was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman (Breeding 2002a). The
dam was constructed between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation, and recreational
purposes. Elevation of the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal elevation in
winter is 220.6 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl), or 67.2 meters (m) amsl, and 227.5 ft amsl
(69.3 m amsl) in summer. Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft amsl (79.1 m amsl). During the
summer, the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal winter conservation pool is 20,300 acres.
Three parcels totaling 1,029 acres are currently planned for timber thinning.

Highway 259 B Parcel
The Highway 259 B parcel is located in Camp and Upshur counties on the north end of Lake O’
the Pines, about 3 km south of Lone Star and 12 km north of Ore City (see Figure 1-7). Totaling
58 acres, this parcel is situated 100 m east of the Highway 259 A parcel, just south of the Lone
Star Steel Co. Highway 259 forms the southeastern boundary of the parcel. The tract measures
approximately 600 m northwest–southeast by 580 m northeast–southwest. It is located on the
Lone Star USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle. Elevation varies from 230 ft amsl (70.1 m amsl)
at the lowest point to 234 ft amsl (71.3 m amsl).

1.3 	Natural Environment
The project area is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the
region include secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands
observed during the field inventory typically consisted of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
(Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly
various oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate) and white oak (Quercus alba),
and the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) (Diggs et al. 1999). Figures 1-8 and 1-9
illustrate typical landscape views for the project area.
Wildlife species common to the area include whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red
fox (Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
opossum (Didelphus virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria
(Myocastor coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Davis and
Schmidly 1994). Lake habitats support a variety of turtles (Figure 1-10), frogs, and snakes,
as well as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris)
and channel (Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white bass (Morone chrysops), white (Pomoxis
annularis) and black (Pomoxis
nigromaculatus) crappie, and
bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)
and other sunfish (Thomas et
al. 2007). Bird species include
the endangered red-cockaded
woodpecker (Picoides borealis),
bald
eagles
(Haliaeetus
leucocephalus),
osprey
(Pandion haliaetus), bobwhite
(Colinus virginianus), mourning
dove (Zenaida macroura),

1.4 	Geology and Soils
1.4.1 Underlying Geologic Formations
The geologic formations of the project area consist of the Clairborne and Wilcox groups
undivided of the Eocene, and Fluviatile terrace deposits and Alluvium of the Pleistocene.
Within these groups, varying formations compose the underlying bedrock.
At Wright Patman Lake, the underlying bedrock of the Highway 59 East parcel consists of the
Alluvium of the Pleistocene and the Wilcox group undivided of the Eocene. The Wilcox group
undivided consists of sandy, lignitiferous, littoral clays that are cross-bedded with river sands,
compact non-calcareous clays, and stratified deltaic silts. The basal beds of this formation
“mark the transition from marine muds and silts of the underlying Wills Point formation to
coarser, littoral, deltaic, and non-marine deposits of the Wilcox” (Sellards et al. 1990:573). This
formation has a thickness of approximately 1,260 ft (384 m). Also present within the Highway
59 East parcel is the Pleistocene Alluvium. This formation is constructed of floodplain and
channel deposits with sand, silt, clay, and gravels. It is approximately 30 ft (9 m) thick and
includes the lowest terrace deposits near floodplain level (Sellards et al. 1990). Pleistocene
Alluvium is also present in the Bassett Creek parcel of Wright Patman Lake. Within this parcel,
the Alluvium formation is present along the contours of Bassett Creek. The remainder of the
underlying bedrock within the Bassett Creek parcel consists of the Fluviatile terrace deposits
of the Pleistocene. These deposits contain gravel, sand, and silt, and contiguous terraces of
different ages within these deposits are separated by a solid line. Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace
deposits also make up the underlying bedrock of the Berry Farm parcel at Wright Patman Lake.
At Lake O’ the Pines, underlying bedrock of the Alley Creek and Highway 259 A and B parcels
consists of the Pleistocene Alluvium and the Queen City formation of the Clairborne group
undivided. The Queen City formation is of Eocene age and is present under the Alley Creek
parcel. This formation is a “series of laminated or thickly stratified, white and red sands and
sandy clays” (Sellards et al. 1990:628). Stretching across much of East Texas in a south—
southwestward direction, the Queen City formation has a thickness ranging from 80 to 400 ft
(24 to 121 m). This thickness thins as the formation continues eastward. Beneath the Highway
259 A and B parcels, the underlying bedrock consists of the formerly described Pleistocene
Alluvium (Sellards et al. 1990).

1.4.2 Soil Formations
Wright Patman Lake
Soils within the Wright Patman Lake survey area include the Annona, Ashford, Bibb, Bryarly,
Eastwood, Gladewater, Kirvin, Ruston, Sawyer, Texark, Thenas, and Woodtell series. All soil
descriptions and profiles are from the Soil Survey Staff (2009). Typical pedons are described
in Appendix A.

The Bassett Creek parcel also contains Gladewater series soils, which consist of very deep,
poorly drained clayey soils on floodplains. Slopes in this series range from 0 to 1 percent.
Annona series soils were also encountered within the Bassett Creek parcel. Annona soils
are very deep, moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable. They formed in clayey
sediments and are located on terraces of Pleistocene age. These soils have slopes ranging from
0 to 8 percent.
A small portion of the parcel consisted of the Ashford series, which contains very deep, poorly
drained, and very slowly permeable soils. These soils are formed in clayey alluvium, are nearly
level, and are located on stream terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 1 percent.
Ten percent of the soil within the Bassett parcel is classified under the Bryarly series. Bryarly
soils are deep, moderately well drained, and very slowly permeable. These upland soils formed
in alkaline clayey marine deposits and have slopes ranging from 1 to 8 percent.
Texark series soils make up the remainder of the parcel. These soils are very deep, somewhat
poorly drained, and very slowly permeable. These soils formed in clayey alluvium and are on
nearly level floodplains. These soils have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.
Berry Farm Parcel
The Berry Farm parcel of Wright Patman Lake is dominated by Ashford clay soils, equaling
50 percent of the parcel. Other soils present within the parcel include the Sawyer, Annona,
Woodtell, Ruston, and Thenas series (Table 1-3).
Fifty percent of the parcel consists of Ashford series soils, described above. The next largest
portion of the parcel consists of Sawyer series soils. The Sawyer series consists of very deep,
moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey marine
sediments of Tertiary age. These soils are on uplands of the Western and Southern Coastal
Plains and have slopes predominantly of 1 to 8 percent, but range to 25 percent.

are located on floodplains and formed in loamy alluvial sediments. Thenas series soils have
slopes of 0 to 2 percent.
Highway 59 East Parcel
Soils within the Highway 59 East parcel consist mainly of Bibb series, but also include
Eastwood and Kirvin series (Table 1-4).
The Bibb soil series makes up half of the Highway 59 East parcel. Bibb soils are very deep,
poorly drained, and moderately permeable soils. They formed in stratified loamy and sandy
alluvium, and are on floodplains of streams in the Coastal Plain. Bibb soils are commonly
flooded, and water runs off the surface very slowly. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.
The next largest portion of the Highway 59 East parcel consists of Eastwood series soils.
These soils are deep, moderately well drained, very fine sandy loam over clay and weakly
consolidated siltstone on uplands. Slopes range from one to 20 percent.
The remaining 19 percent of the
parcel is represented by Kirvin soils.
Kirvin soils are a moderately deep
fine sandy loam that commonly
occurs on gently sloping to sloping
narrow and broad ridges, round
knobs, and inter-stream divides.
They commonly have a slope
ranging from 8 to 25 percent, but can
range up to 40 percent.

Iulus series soils make up 28 percent of the soils within the Alley Creek parcel. Iulus soils
are very deep, moderately well drained, and moderately permeable. These soils are located
on floodplains and formed in recent alluvium derived from coastal plain sediments. The
slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.
Nine percent of the Alley Creek parcel soils consists of the Tenaha series. These soils are
deep, well drained soils that are gently sloping to moderately steep. The Tenaha series formed
in sandy and loamy residuum on uplands of the Claiborne geological group and have slopes
ranging from 1 to 35 percent. The remainder of the Alley Creek parcel soils consists of the
Kirvin series, described above.
Highway 259 A and B Parcels
The parcels of Highway 259 A and B are adjacent to each other and separated by an oxbow
lake of Big Cypress Creek. The Camp–Upshur county line is located in the southern portion
of these parcels. Because of the close proximity of the two parcels, they share the same soil
types. Therefore, these two parcels will be discussed together in this section. Soils within the
Highway 259 A and B parcels are dominated by the Besner-Talco complex. The remainder of
the parcel is constructed of Bienville, Nahatche, Iuka, Estes, and Mantachie series soils and
of the Latch-Mollville complex (Table 1-6).

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,394 Acres at Wright Patman Lake and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

The majority of soils within the Highway 259 A and B parcels are classified under the BesnerTalco complex. The Besner series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable
soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are mainly on mounds and formed in alluvial
sediments on Pleistocene terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The Talco series consists
of deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on stream terraces, or remmants
thereof, 50–200 ft above present streams. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed
in loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene Age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.
The next largest portion of the Highway 259 A and B parcels soils consists of the Bienville
series. Bienville soils are very deep, somewhat excessively drained, and moderately rapidly
permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy coastal plain sediments on nearly level or
gently sloping stream terraces. Slope is predominantly 1 to 3 percent, but ranges from 0 to
5 percent.
Nahatche series soils are also present in the Highway 259 A and B parcels. Nahatche soils
are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, and moderately permeable soils on floodplains.
They formed in stratified loamy alluvium and have slopes ranging from 0 to 1 percent.
Iuka series soils occur in ten percent of the Highway 259 A and B parcels. These soils are
deep, moderately well drained, and moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified
loamy and sandy alluvial sediments. Iuka soils are on nearly level floodplains. They are
saturated with water at depths of 1–3 ft below the surface during wet seasons and are subject
to flooding. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.
Nine percent of the Highway 259 A and B parcels soils are classified within the Estes series.
Estes soils consist of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils. These nearly level floodplain
soils formed in acid clayey and loamy alluvium in the Coastal Plains. Slope ranges from 0 to
1 percent. Mantachie series soils were also encountered in the Highway 259 A and B parcels
and are described above.­
The final portion of the soils within the Highway 259 A and B parcels are classified within
the Latch-Mollville complex. The Latch series consists of very deep, moderately well

Cultural Context
2.1 	Previous Investigations
A map and records search was conducted at the archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC Archeological
Sites Atlas online database on March 2–3, 2009. These searches determined that two previously
recorded archeological sites are plotted within the project area in two different parcels. One
site is located within the Highway 59 East parcel at Wright Patman Lake, and one is within the
Highway 259 A parcel at Lake O’ the Pines. Each of these sites is described in more detail in
Chapter 4.

2.1.1 Wright Patman Lake
Bassett Creek Parcel
The THC Archeological Sites Atlas records indicate that one site, 41BW35, was recorded
within one mile of the Bassett Creek parcel in 1949 during the River Basin Survey; however,
the map of the parcel does not show any surveys conducted within one mile of the Bassett
Creek parcel. The site is described below in Table 2-1.
Berry Farm Parcel
In 2004, EComm conducted a survey for USACE that included two parcels just across Kelley
Creek to the north of the parcel and recorded six sites. To the east at the mouth of Kelley Creek,
a survey was conducted during which three sites were recorded; one of these sites is within a
mile of the Berry Farm parcel. Four additional sites were recorded to the south of the parcel by
various organizations. All 11 sites are described in Table 2-1.
Highway 59 East Parcel
In 1949, the National Park Service conducted the River Basin Survey, in which five sites
were recorded within a mile of the parcel. In 1970, the USACE conducted a shoreline survey
that recorded many sites, one of which was within a mile of the Highway 59 East parcel.
Additionally in 1997, the USACE contracted with Linder-Linsley and Lindsay (LL&L) to
survey a parcel of land west of the Highway 59 East parcel, on the opposite side of Highway
59. This survey resulted in nine newly recorded sites; four of these sites are within one mile
of the Highway 59 East survey parcel. The report for this survey was not located, but the
USACE provided information on the survey. Several additional sites were recorded without
accompanying surveys; these sites and all sites within one mile of the Highway 59 East parcel
are described in Table 2-1.

2.1.2 Lake O’ the Pines
Alley Creek Parcel
In 1997 the USACE conducted a survey along the eastern banks of Alley Creek from Lake O’
the Pines north to Mim’s Chapel Cutoff. This survey included about 40 acres of the Alley Creek
parcel. The survey resulted in no sites being recorded. Further south is one of the northern arms
of the river basin survey conducted around Big Cypress Bayou in 1951 before impoundment.
Three sites are within a mile of the Alley Creek parcel and are described in Table 2-2.
Highway 259 A and B Parcels
In 1996 and 1997 Linder-Linsley and Lindsay conducted a survey in four different parcels
around the Highway 259 A and B parcels. Three of these parcels stretch from inside the
Highway 259 A parcel at County Road 4430 in Camp County, north to the air strip at the
southwest corner of Ellison Creek Reservoir. The fourth parcel LL&L surveyed is located just
east of the Highway 259 B parcel. This survey resulted in no less than 26 sites being recorded.
Of the 26 recorded sites 13 are within one mile (1.6 km) of the Highway 259 A and B parcel
boundaries. A linear survey was conducted along the route of County Road 4430 resulting in
no sites being recorded. Just south of the eastern LL&L survey is the northwestern end of the
river basin survey conducted in 1951 prior to Lake O’ the Pines being impounded; this survey

2.2

Cultural Context

CULTURAL FRAMEWORK

The prehistoric cultural framework in the Northeast Texas region has been recorded by many
archeological investigations and includes the Paleoindian period, Archaic and Woodland
periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. The cultural framework discussed
below has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995,
2004).

2.2.1 Paleoindian Period
Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleoindian period (ca. 9500–7000 BC) in
Northeast Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff,
and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds or found in
excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas.
Regardless of the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding settlement
mobility and subsistence patterns during the Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas. Evidence
suggests that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized toolkit, and that they were
more likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game
hunters (Perttula 2004).

2.2.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic period (ca. 7000–200 BC) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000–4000 BC),
Middle (ca. 4000–2000 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000–200 BC), although in the Northeast
region of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate these different
periods. During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more widely distributed,
suggesting high group mobility within large territories. Archeological data also suggest a
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy that is focused on the exploitation of a
wide variety of resources. Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt
to be concentrated in the larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in the
region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the
increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features.
Possible hearths, ovens, and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and
cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major
streams and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. Population density may have
peaked during the Late Archaic, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.2.3 Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics tempered with clay/grog or bone and Gary projectile points. At sites near
the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and
diet during this time, all of which may have had an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
who lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain locations than
they had in the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site, small settlements with
structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these sites are not as
permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the
exception of those in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river basins, Woodland sites are not
very common throughout much of Northeast Texas. No Woodland-period burial mounds have
been documented in the region.

2.2.4 Formative Caddo Period and Early Caddo Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddo period (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddo period
(ca. AD 1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These villages are more common during the Early Caddo period and continue
through the Middle Caddo period, and include large groups of many structures, mound
centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools,
and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and
Early Caddo sites (Perttula 2004).

2.2.5 Middle Caddo Period
Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD 1200–
1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddo period. One example of such a site is the Oak Hill
Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures. Cultivation of
maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and other crops
until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).

Cultural Context

2.2.6 Late Caddo Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddo sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddo-period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used
between AD 1400 and 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction continued
until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and bioarcheological evidence
from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily dependent on maize as
their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples living in the northeastern Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers.
These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community
cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus-phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. AD 1540) is commonly referred to as
the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region from the
Mississippi River valley and a number of different Caddo groups were probably encountered
by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada, the area occupied by the
Titus-phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004). While the archeological evidence
of Caddo-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast Texas, intermittent contact probably had
considerable effects on Caddo groups, including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases
like smallpox to which they had no immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

2.2.7 Historic Period
Historic Caddo Period
The Historic Caddo period (ca. AD 1680–1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddo area by Europeans in the region. It is during this period that
the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts recovered
from these sites include a wide variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone,
stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddosites after ca.
AD 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets,
knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

European Exploration and Historic Periods
Area of Wright Patman Lake
The first likely European expedition into the area around Wright Patman Lake was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern US and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route back
to New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County, and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the
area to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence
began in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location
just to the northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as
a trading station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years
after the Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish,
under the name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying
to foster a relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored
the area in 1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by Thomas Jefferson, traveled up
the Red River to Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began
in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years.
By 1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been
resolved. The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton
plantations as well as raised corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave
population outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half
in Cass County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b). As was expected, the white population strongly
supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up
in the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where
two major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the
largest trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was
founded in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding
rural community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from

that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all,
and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Wright Patman Lake was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.
Area of Lake O’ the Pines
Much of the area around Big Cypress Creek and what would become Lake O’ the Pines
remained uninhabited for most of the eighteenth century. The first Anglo-American settlements
were formed in the 1840s, and the town of Jefferson was founded at that time. The settlers were
primarily from Tennessee and Alabama; the area of east Upshur County and Marion County
was inhabited by settlers from Alabama. They set up a way of life similar to what they had at
home, which included large cotton plantations using slave labor (Atkins 2002; Kirby 2002).
Jefferson quickly became a booming river port town, in fact the largest inland port in Texas.
North Texas agricultural produce was shipped to Shreveport and New Orleans, and as a result
of this connection with the Mississippi River system and factories to the east, new amenities
such as refrigeration, soda water, artificial gas for lighting, and ice production made their first
appearance as early as the 1870s (Atkins 2002). The white population supported the secession
movement and the Confederacy in the Civil War, and ordnance, rifles, and tinned food were
manufactured for the Confederate forces. Military occupation followed the Civil War, although
white suppression of the black majority continued to persist. Jefferson declined significantly in
1873, when the destruction of the “raft” (a massive log jam) on the Red River above Shreveport
reduced the water levels of Big Cypress Creek. The establishment of rail transportation in other
parts of the state also contributed to its decline (Long 2002a).
Rich iron ore deposits in eastern Upshur County had been mined on and off since the 1860s,
but the town of Ore City was not founded until 1911, anticipating the arrival of the Port Bolivar
Iron Ore Railroad. This railroad was chartered in December, 1910, to connect Longview with
an area rich in iron ore near Hughes Springs, a distance of about 50 miles. Construction began
in 1912, but World War I halted completion of the line and it was abandoned in 1927 (Young
2002). Ore City operated as a mining and lumbering center, and managed to survive after these
major industries became non-operational (Long 2002b). Oil was discovered in the 1910s and
gave a boost to the manufacturing sector. The Depression dealt the area a hard blow, especially
the agricultural economy, but rising oil prices and federal assistance helped the area recover
more quickly than other areas of Texas. The economy and population of the area declined
slightly over the next 30 years, but the area moved more toward a tourist economy with the
development of urban heritage sites in Jefferson, obtaining NRHP status in 1971, as well as
water recreation from Caddo Lake State Park and Lake O’ the Pines, which were developed in
the 1930s and 1950s, respectively.

Chapter 3

Methods
The archeological field inventory was conducted in three field sessions: March 18–27, April
1–10, and April 20–24, 2009. Seventy-two person-days were spent in the field. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field
tactics stipulated by the USACE (2007).

3.1 	Survey tactics
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with ArcGIS giving the number
of shovel tests per transect to obtain the coverage goal. Each field archeologist was given
a copy of both aerial and USGS topo views of the parcel and was assigned a transect line
and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated with an alpha-numeric
prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that shovel test
“7E-4” identified the fourth test along the seventh transect of the fifth day of the project. In
general, each crew member followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other
crew members. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with
one person digging the shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or
two or more surveyors would “leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel
tests. Surveyors were given flexibility to place their shovel tests in likely locations, such as
topographic rises, rather than being at set intervals.
Special effort was made to relocate the previously recorded sites in two of the parcels. For
these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the location, or suspected
location, of the site. The crew referred to the site’s plot on the USGS topographic maps at
TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the UTM (or latitude/
longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible conversion errors in
coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected location(s), the
crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of the site
was seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines of
evidence.
At all shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations.
Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site
locations, such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not
be dug due to standing water, erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually
recorded on the shovel testing log.
All shovel tests were 30–35 centimeters (cm) in diameter and were dug to the bottom of the
Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 centimeters below ground surface (cmbs)
if no clay was present. Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type

Methods

and color, and cultural material present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not
exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all excavated material was screened through ¼-inch (6.4
mm) stainless steel mesh.
All cultural material was collected with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass
shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance
and were not collected. The exceptions to this collection policy include the investigations of
site 41BW758 and 41CP492. All shovel tests were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances up to nine tests in an area. If more than one of
these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the
location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated
occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but
these were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were
similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests.
On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron rebar fixed with an
aluminum survey tag. Tags were stamped with:
ECOMM 046-029
USACE FS#

On each tag, “FS” designates Field Site and was followed by a temporary site number
for newly recorded sites. Pre-recorded sites were marked using their existing trinomial
designations.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify
zones of zero or low artifact presence. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests
or absence of surface artifacts, site boundaries were marked with pink-glo flagging tape
when tree cover allowed on site GPS mapping; otherwise, shovel test locations were used
to delineate site boundaries in the lab using ArcGIS. Sites were photographed and mapped
using a Trimble GeoXT sub-meter GPS and were recorded using State of Texas site forms.
All excavated artifacts were recovered and were processed and analyzed by the authors in
EComm’s Austin laboratory. All artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL upon
completion of analysis.

3.2 	Density of Shovel Testing
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate
of coverage, a total of 468 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 1,394
acres (Table 3-1). In an attempt to ensure greater coverage than this minimum, 913 transect
shovel tests were actually excavated, or nearly double the contractual minimum. The lowest
coverage was 0.61 tests per acre at the Bassett Creek parcel at Wright Patman Lake, and the

greatest coverage was one test per acre at Highway 59 East at Wright Patman Lake. For the
project as a whole, final coverage averaged about 0.65 tests per acre. In addition, 117 shovel
tests were dug on sites, in search of previous sites, or around isolated occurrences. Appendix
B provides maps of shovel test locations by parcel, and the data from all 1,030 shovel tests
are presented in Appendix C.

3.3

Archival Research

Following field work, archival research was conducted on all sites whose archeological
evidence dated to the historic period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify
historically notable persons possibly associated with each site.
Initial archival research was carried out by examining the primary sources in the deed, land
title, and probate records. This research was conducted in Linden, Texas for Cass County and
in Jefferson, Texas for Marion County; no historic-period sites were discovered in Camp,
Upshur or Bowie Counties. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees were identified
and their presence in the area during the period of interest was verified through United States
Census data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals
of historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in
The Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and the
General Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance
was in any way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled
and the nature of the person’s relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched
to determine the level of the person’s involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property
and/or actively participating in its development were determined to be significantly
associated with the property. Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor
actively participating in its development (i.e., absentee owners) were determined to be not
significantly associated with the property.

3.4	Evaluation of Significance
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 USC 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located
on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must take into
account the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies
are required to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties
owned or under their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity as
defined in 36 CFR §60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR §60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance and with respect to
NHPA Criterion D. The demonstrated data content of each site was compared to the important
research contexts as outlined below. Sites in good condition and state of preservation and
having several data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts were evaluated as
significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed to be in poor condition or state
of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or more of the research contexts
were evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose expression could not be satisfactorily
investigated using the survey level tactics employed by this study were classified as being of
unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, were
also evaluated with respect to Criterion B. Because none of the historic sites retained any
architectural elements, Criterion C was not applicable. Similarly, none of the sites are associated
with important historical events and so Criterion A was not applicable.

3.5	Historic Contexts
The eligibility of an archeological site to be nominated to the NRHP is generally determined by
matching the formal attributes of the site (its date, type, size, artifact content, etc.) to previously
developed “historic contexts.” These are broad research themes that identify key research
questions, together with the types of data that are necessary to satisfactorily address them.
Sites that possess data types that can address many of the research questions are determined to
be significant; sites that possess few or no such data types are considered to be not significant.
This discussion briefly summarizes several historic contexts which are commonly applied to
evaluate the significance of archeological sites in East Texas. The contexts are closely adapted
from those developed by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), and the reader is directed
to that comprehensive planning document for the essential details for each of the following
contextual themes. For Northeast Texas, four broad research contexts are here identified:
(1) early hunter-gatherer mobility; (2) the emergence of sedentism; (3) the development of
agriculture; and (4) the effects of European contact. An overview of each of these themes is
summarized below, focusing on the data needs that can be used to infer the research value of
a given site.

3.5.1 Hunter-Gatherer Mobility
Questions of hunter-gather mobility in Northeast Texas have been most fully developed by
Fields and Tomka (1993:69–96) and focus on the Paleoindian period (9500–7000 BC) and the
Archaic period (7000–200 BC). This time range overlaps marginally with that identified in
the Emergence of Sedentism context. Archeological knowledge of this period is still limited
in many aspects, and the research needs that are identified under this context are fairly basic.
Important new research under this context will focus on the following topics.
Chronology and Typology
Additional well-controlled chronometric information associated with a variety of site types
and artifact types is needed to refine the fundamental space-time systematics for this broad
time range in Northeast Texas.
Settlement Systems
Research is necessary to better understand the variability between different non-sedentary
settlements. New information is needed about the relative permanence of settlements, their
intensity of occupation, and general land use strategies. Observations about the internal
configurations of residential sites and the degree of variability between these are critical.
Subsistence
Much more information is needed regarding the diversity of food resources that contributed
to human diet during this time, and also to changes in the resource mix over time. Especially
interesting will be research examining the relative contributions of plant and animal taxa, and
Ecological Communications Corporation

31

the decision-making framework that determined which resources were economically exploited.
In addition, stable isotope analyses of human skeletal remains are called for to provide for
indirect reconstruction of diet.
Trade and Exchange
New research should seek to better understand the role of local and regional trade systems,
especially with regards to the acquisition of key non-food resources such as lithic raw materials
and status goods. Such research will inform on the nature and extent of territorial ranges, the
isolation and stability of populations, and the development of inter-group exchange networks.
Technology and Change
More investigation is warranted into the complex interrelationships between food-getting
strategies, group mobility, and technology, especially with regard to changes over time in lithic
tools and alternative manufacturing processes.

3.5.2 The Emergence of Sedentism
The transition from mobile to sedentary populations in northeast Texas and the consequent
increase in overall cultural complexity is still poorly understood. This historic context focuses
on the period from about 500 BC to AD 1000, including the Late Archaic period (500–200 BC),
the Early Ceramic period (200 BC–AD 800), and the Formative Caddo period (AD 800–1000).
The synthesis of Perttula et al. (1993:97–120) develops a diverse suite of research objectives
including those listed below.
Settlement Systems
To understand the process and tempo of increasing sedentism during the Late Archaic and
Early Ceramic periods, new data are needed about the population sizes and spatial distribution
of settlements, their successful duration, and their general land use strategies. As with the
comparable focus under the Hunter-Gatherer Mobility context, observations about the internal
configuration of residential sites will be important, including the diversity and ubiquity of
feature types.
Subsistence
More research is warranted into changes in resource selection and procurement in response to
increasing sedentism. Key questions will focus on which resources were replaced by horticulture
and to what degree, and the nature of the relationships between increasing population size,
reduced mobility, and resource procurement.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,394 Acres at Wright Patman Lake and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

Social Systems
As sedentism increased in Northeast Texas, social organization and political structures changed.
An increased understanding of these changes will examine community hierarchies, ceremonial
activities, and political and social stratification through analyses of diversity in mound features
and status goods and their spatial distributions.
Demography and Health
Reliable data are needed that inform on changes and trends in regional and local population
sizes and densities and in the spatial distribution of populations across the landscape. In
addition, isotopic and forensic examinations of well-dated human skeletal assemblages will be
key sources of information about human health and demography.
Mortuary Practices
As human populations became increasingly sedentary during this period, their treatment of
the dead changed. Important new research will examine the development of formal cemeteries
during this period, including the differences in mound and non-mound burials, and between
cremations and flexed interments through the acquisition of new basic burial data, including
grave goods.
Trade and Exchange
With increased sedentism and the related potential for increased complexity in material goods
came the development of new economic exchange networks. Valuable research in Northeast
Texas will address the relationships between politics and these economic networks, especially
the political controls over access to raw materials and the political relationships between
archeological sites that may be “central places.” Research should also examine changes over
time in these intra-regional and inter-regional interaction patterns.
Technological Change and Ceramics
Increased sedentism and the development of new subsistence strategies were accompanied
by a suite of new technologies. The timing and distribution of these are important keys to
understanding culture change in general during this period. In particular, the introduction of
ceramics suggests a decrease in mobility as well as increased storage capacity and changes
in horticultural production strategies. Early ceramic manufacturing strategies need research,
including selection of raw materials. Other technological attributes of sedentism include
storage facilities and permanent architecture.

3.5.3 The Development of Agriculture
The adoption of agriculture in Northeast Texas during the Caddo period (AD 800–1680)
was arguably the most important cultural innovation to date, creating an increasingly intense
positive feedback loop between sedentism, population size, and technological change. The
research themes under this historic context have been most succinctly treated by Perttula
(1993a:121–146) and are discussed below.
Subsistence Patterns
Key to understanding human adaptations during this period are changes in the economic
resource mix, especially timing and extent of the shift from the opportunistic horticulture of
native cultigens to intensive maize cultivation. Isotopic analyses of skeletal assemblages will
provide valuable inferences on human diet.
Settlement Systems
As agriculture became the dominant food-getting strategy, changes occurred in the preferred
places for habitation, in the relationships between populations within a region, and in the
internal complexity of habitations. These developments may be examined though examining
changes in architecture, settlement composition and arrangement, and diversity in overall
settlement sizes. Research should look at the composition and internal arrangement of farming
communities and their relationships to ceremonial centers. Additional knowledge of trail
systems between population centers and ceremonial centers are needed.
Social and Political Complexity
Significant changes in political organizations were facilitated by agriculture and sedentism.
The examination of the distribution of status goods and the development of public architecture
will provide insights into political structures, as will the analysis of the hierarchical complexity
of settlement types.
Demography
The adoption of agriculture fundamentally changed human societies in Northeast Texas.
A detailed understanding of the timing, intensity, and spatial distribution of changes in
population sizes, both positive and negative, will allow a deeper understanding of the adoption
of agriculture. A regional analysis of habitation sites will provide a broad perspective, while
forensic examination of skeletal assemblages will provide detailed inform on population
structures.
Mortuary Practices
Research into mortuary practices is potentially informative about developments in social
organization, and ritual and belief systems. During the Caddo period, the distribution and

34

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,394 Acres at Wright Patman Lake and Lake O’ the Pines, Texas

complexity of community cemeteries is of special interest, including the use of shaft burials
within earthen mounds.
Trade and Exchange
As populations grew in size and complexity during this period, exchange networks broadened.
Exotic goods were introduced through long distance trade, and local style became a
recognizable variable in the production of material goods. Examination of the temporal and
spatial distributions of these markers will assist the understanding of both intra-regional and
interregional exchange networks.
Technology and Changes in Material Culture
This theme overlaps to some extent with similar ideas under the previous Emergence of
Sedentism context. Additional research is warranted into the emergence and spread of new
technologies including the bow and arrow, various agricultural implements, and pottery. These
developments occurred parallel with changes in architecture and building materials, and as a
more diverse set of raw materials became available through the wider exchange networks.

3.5.4 The Effects of European Contacts
Contact with Europeans left unprecedented and indelible changes on the peoples of Northeast
Texas. Examination of these changes focuses on the Protohistoric period (AD 1540–1680)
as well as the Historic Indian period (AD 1680–1860). These changes are explored in depth
by Perttula (1992), and the relevant research themes have also been summarized by Perttula
(1993b). Unique to this time is the availability of archival and ethnohistoric sources to
supplement archeological data.
Demography and Health
As a direct result of contact with Europeans, population sizes in Northeast Texas plummeted
due to the introduction of new epidemic diseases. The catastrophic population declines in
turn triggered significant changes in politics and social organization. Forensic examinations
of skeletal assemblages are fundamental sources of important information about human
populations and public health.
Language and Ideology
Significant research into the related issues of language and ideology is uniquely possible during
the Historic period. Archival documents record place names and tribal names and meticulous
archival and ethnohistoric research can identify and infer a measure of the impact Europeans
brought on language and on traditional belief systems. Changes in ceremonialism following
the catastrophic effects of new diseases can be traced through ceremonial architecture and the
introduction and spread of new exotic goods.

Ecological Communications Corporation

35

Chapter 3

Status, Social Structure, and Political Organization
As contact with Europeans precipitated decreases in population size, Caddo societies adapted
by evolving modified social hierarchies and complex social organizations. These changes can
be examined through the distribution and ubiquity of status markers such as European trade
goods, symbology, and public architecture. Archival and ethnohistoric research can illuminate
migrations, alliances, and subjugation.
Subsistence and Economy
The introduction of new technologies, especially firearms and the horse, permitted and, to
an extent, forced significant changes in economic strategies. Archeological evidence for the
introduction and spread of these new technologies is vital, together with data informing on the
replacement of traditional cultigens and domesticates with introduced ones, such as chickens
and cows. Other important research will investigate changes in food processing and food
storage strategies.
Technology
Contact with Europeans brought knowledge of new materials, new manufacturing techniques,
and whole new industries (such as animal husbandry). Firearms and the introduction of the
horse brought permanent changes to Caddo societies. More research is needed into the spatial
and temporal distribution of introduced goods such as metal tools, implements, and containers.
The Historic period affords an ideal opportunity to understand the general mechanisms and
rates by which various new artifact types are adopted into traditional systems and replace
earlier technologies.
Trade and Exchange
With Europeans came exposure to much wider economic networks. New types of goods and
new raw materials were introduced, while at the same time European markets created increased
demand for traditional goods such as salt and furs. The distribution through time and space of
introduced artifact materials such as metal and glass are keys to understanding the effects that
European contacts had on traditional trade networks.
Acculturation
During the Historic period, acculturating the native peoples was an explicit objective of the
Europeans. The formal relationships between the French, and then the Spanish, and the Caddo
are a key research objective. Overlapping greatly with the closely related themes of ideology,
economy, status, technology, and trade, more archeological research is needed of the villages
that were associated with missions and European settlements.

Chapter 4

Results at Wright Patman Lake
Three parcels totaling 1,029 acres were investigated at Wright Patman Lake. Within the
three parcels, six new archeological sites were discovered and documented and the location
of one previously recorded site was investigated. In addition, two isolated occurrences were
encountered and investigated.

4.1	Bassett Creek Parcel
The Bassett Creek parcel totaled 523 acres and was inventoried using 318 transect shovel
tests, for a density of 0.61 shovel tests per acre. Five new cultural resource sites (41BW755,
41BW756, 41BW757, 41BW758, and 41BW759) and one isolated occurrence were
documented. These were investigated with an additional 68 shovel tests. See Appendices
B and C for the locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Bassett Creek
parcel. Maps showing the locations of archeological sites and the State of Texas Archeological
Data Site Forms are presented in Appendices D and E; as they contain sensitive information,
they are distributed on CD-ROM for restricted access only.

4.1.1 41BW755
Site 41BW755 (Figures 4-1 and 4-2) is a 22 x 16-m prehistoric site of undetermined age. It
is situated on top of a terrace north of Mudd Lake (an oxbow lake of Calvert Creek) and west
of Bassett Creek. The terrace is moderately wooded and has an elevation of about 255 ft amsl
(77.7 m amsl), barely above
the floodplain of Mudd
Lake, and just 3 ft (1 m)
higher than Wright Patman
Lake at full flood capacity.
The typical vegetation in
the site is pine and hickory
trees. Soils within the
site are Woodtell series,
with shallow clay. Surface
visibility is approximately 5
percent.
In addition to pedestrian
survey, a total of 10 shovel
tests were excavated to
assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site

4.1.2 41BW756
Site 41BW756 (Figures 4-3 and 4-4) is a 27 x 14-m prehistoric site of undetermined age.
It is situated on top of a terrace north of Mudd Lake (an oxbow lake of Calvert Creek)
and west of Bassett Creek.
The terrace is moderately
wooded and has an elevation
of about 264 ft amsl (80.5

4.1.4 41BW758
Site 41BW758 is a 93 x 27-m historic site dating to the early twentieth century. In addition
to the historic component, there is also a prehistoric component of unknown affiliation.
The terrace was previously
cleared and now supports
immature trees and abundant
groundcover (Figure 4-7).
The terrace is about 267
ft amsl (81.4 m amsl),
approximately 27 ft (8.2
m) above the floodplain of
Mudd Lake and 7 ft (2.1 m)
higher than Wright Patman
Lake at full flood capacity.

site is a midstory of mixed
hardwood and groundcover

visibility is 10 percent.
The location of this site
correlates to the location of a building symbol on the 1927 Bassett 15’ topographic map
(Figure 4-8). This map is drawn by hand without the aid of aerial photography, so it is not as
accurate as a modern-day topographic map.
41BW758 is located on a portion of the J. C. Drotz Survey, which was transferred to the
United States of America through eminent domain in 1953 (Bowie County Deed Records
[BCDR] Vol. 301, p. 69). At the time the US government acquired the land, it appeared to
have gone through many years of litigation; ownership history on this parcel is tangled and
was difficult to research. The US government acquired the property from unknown owners,
suggesting the land was abandoned at the time.

Results at Wright Patman Lake

The parcel was first patented in 1914 by J. W. Nelson as part of a 320-acre tract from the
southern half of the Section 4 Texas and Pacific Railroad Survey (BCDR Vol. 69, p. 511), after
he lived on it for three years. The patent claims he bought it from the state in 1900, but no
proof of this could be located. In 1918, Nelson sold the land to James W. Tidwell (BCDR Vol.
83, p. 426). Records suggest that Tidwell may have transferred trusteeship of the land to an
M. C. Dyer shortly after that. Then, in 1923, Dyer was successfully sued by the Bowie County
Levee Improvement District No. 2 for failure to pay taxes on the land, and the land was seized
for auction. In 1925, the First National Bank of New Boston bought the land, but on the deed
it lists Tidwell as the owner, not Dyer, and includes the whole 320-acre parcel (BCDR Vol.
114, p. 417). The Bowie County Improvement District No. 2 was created in 1919 in order to
control flooding from the Sulphur River and its tributary waterways (Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality 2003). A levee was built along the west side of Bassett Creek to its

confluence with the Sulphur River, then along the north side of the Sulphur River to Calvert
Creek (Figure 4-9). After Bowie County acquired the land, the structures within the limits of
the improvement district were likely abandoned and either demolished or left vacant.
In 1946, the US government enacted a flood control act that authorized the construction of
dams across the county; among them was Denison Dam, which impounds Lake Texoma and
was designed to control flooding along the Red River below Denison, Texas. The creation of
Wright Patman Lake was a part of this comprehensive flood control project. Its construction
replaced the need for levees along the Sulphur River, and the Bowie County Levee Improvement
District No. 2 was disbanded. In 1946, J. C. Drotz acquired the land and was granted a new
patent (Bowie County Patent Records Vol. 5, p. 32). It is not clear what happened to Drotz, but
by the 1953 eminent domain proceedings, the land ownership was unknown.
The archeological site was discovered during the current survey in two different loci and was
initially thought to be two different sites; shovel testing showed the loci to be connected (Figure
4-10). After the sites were combined, the total size of the site became 93 x 27 m.
Combining the two loci into a single site caused some duplication. Because datum markers
were established before the loci were connected, this site has two datum markers: the southern
datum (at the location of Field Site 5) is now Datum A, and the northern datum (at the location
of Field Site 6) is now Datum B. Combining the loci also resulted in duplicate shovel test
numbers: each locus received ST 1 and ST 2. Since the duplicated shovel test numbers are
on opposite sides of an old washed-out road, the northern two shovel tests were assigned the
prefix “N” (ST N1, ST N2) and the southern two shovel tests were assigned the prefix “S” (ST
S1 and ST S2).
Twenty-six shovel tests were excavated in order to assess the nature of cultural resource
deposition and to delineate site boundaries. Ten of the 26 shovel tests were positive with
historic artifacts (38 percent ubiquity); five of these 10 also had prehistoric artifacts (19 percent
ubiquity). Historic items were found between 0 and 25 cmbs, and prehistoric artifacts were
found from the surface down to 40 cmbs. The bulk of the artifacts were buried at 0–20 cmbs,
but a few surface items were observed including rusted, twisted wire and goat fencing and a
clay sewer pipe with embossed text reading “W.S. DICKEY TEXARKANA.” This artifact
dates after 1905, when the WS Dickey Company opened its Texarkana operation (USGenWeb
2008).
The assemblage from 41BW758 consists of prehistoric lithic debris and historic-period
domestic debris. Prehistoric materials include six small flakes and one biface fragment. Three
of the flakes are made from maroon-colored chalcedony, while the other three are made from a
more fine-grained grayish chert. The biface is made from a maroon-colored chert.
The historic-period debris includes wire nails (n = 14); ceramic whiteware fragments (n =
8); ceramic stoneware fragments (n = 2); clear, blue, brown, and aqua bottle glass (n = 10);
ribbed window glass (n = 2); a fragment of a 78-rpm record; an iron stove part; an iron metal
lock or latch part; a hexagonal brass valve bushing; can fragments (n = 13); a rivet/brad from

a leather strap; and various other unidentified ferrous metal pieces. These were all found in
shovel tests buried no more than 20 cmbs. None of the artifacts contained any identifiable
diagnostic markings except the valve bushing, which was marked “Schrader, USA.” The
Schrader Company makes valves and fittings, and has been in business since 1845 (Land
and Sea Collection 2006). The specimen from 41BW758 is likely part of a hose valve and
probably dates no earlier than the mid-twentieth century.
While none of the other artifacts are particularly diagnostic, the general assemblage seems
to represent the 1940s to 1960s, or possibly later. All clear glass is arsenic bleached and
un-solarized, indicating a post-WWII date. The record fragment found suggests a cut-off date
of around 1960–1970, since 78-rpm records ceased to be manufactured after 1960. The type
of debris also suggests a mid-century or later occupation. The household debris is small and
highly fragmented, suggesting that discard happened by accident (or through demolition),
rather than intentionally, which would be the case for a household that had access to some
sort of organized form of trash collection common to the post-1950s era in rural America.
Personal items (except for the record fragment) and children’s toys are completely absent
from this collection. Overall, the artifacts have very limited data potential.

4.1.5 41BW759
Site 41BW759 is a 19 x 13-m prehistoric site of undetermined age. It is situated on top of
a terrace north of Mudd Lake (an oxbow lake of Calvert Creek) and west of Bassett Creek.
The terrace is moderately wooded and has an elevation of about 272 ft amsl (82.9 m amsl),
approximately 32 ft (9.8 m) above the floodplain of Mudd Lake and 12 ft (3.7 m) higher than
Wright Patman Lake at full flood capacity. The typical vegetation in the site is an overstory
of mixed hardwood and an understory of sweetgum and Carolina buckthorn (Figure 4-11).
Soils within the site are Annona series. Surface visibility is 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey, a total of 12 shovel tests were excavated in order to assess
the nature of cultural resource deposition and site boundaries (Figure 4-12). One biface, 19
flakes, and 2 pieces of shatter were recovered between 0 and 80 cmbs in four of the 12 shovel
tests (Table 4-4).

4.1.6 Isolated Occurrence
Within the Bassett Creek parcel, one lithic flake was found in ST 15H-1. Eight additional
shovel tests were dug in the surrounding vicinity in a cruciform pattern at 7 m and 15 m from
the initial test, but all eight of these tests were negative. As a result, this location is considered
to be an isolated occurrence and was not recorded as a site.

4.2	Berry Farm Parcel
The Berry Farm parcel
totaled 463 acres and was
inventoried
using
299
transect shovel tests, for a
density of 0.65 shovel tests
per acre. No cultural resource
sites were found within the
parcel, although one isolated
occurrence was documented
and investigated with eight
additional shovel tests.
Approximately 60 percent
of the northern portion
of the Berry Farm parcel
contains low pimple mounds
(Figure 4-13). While the
rest of the parcel has some
mounds, these are much
more scattered. Additional
shovel tests, more than the
contractual
requirement,
were dug in the areas with
mounds to increase the
chance of discovery. The
southern portion of the
parcel has few mounds and
is not well drained; many
shovel tests could not be
completely excavated due
to inundation (Figure 4-14).
See Appendices B and C for
the locations and results of all
shovel tests excavated within
the Berry Farm parcel.

4.2.1 Isolated Occurrence
One isolated occurrence was present
in the northern area of the Berry
Farm parcel. A Gary point made
of novaculite (Figure 4-15) was
recovered from a shovel test (13Q-2)
on a mound. Eight additional shovel
tests were excavated around this
positive test. Four of these tests were
placed on the same mound and one
each on four surrounding mounds.
All eight tests were negative. As a
result, this location is considered to
be an isolated occurrence and was
not recorded as a site.

testing the northern portion of the Berry Farm parcel.

4.3	Highway 59 East Parcel
The Highway 59 East parcel totaled 43 acres and was inventoried using 43 transect shovel
tests, for a net density of one shovel test per acre. Two cultural resource sites were present and
investigated using 19 additional shovel tests. Previously recorded site 41CS333 was relocated;
the tactics used to locate previously recorded sites are presented in Section 3.1. In addition, one
new cultural resource site (41CS339) was documented. See Appendices B and C for the locations
and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Highway 59 East parcel. Maps showing
the locations of archeological sites and the State of Texas Archeological Data Site Forms are
presented in Appendices D and E; as they contain sensitive information, they are distributed
on CD-ROM for restricted
access only.

4.3.1 41CS333
41CS333 (Figure 4-16) is a
60 x 60-m Late Caddo site
originally recorded in 2006
by Mark Walters of the
Texas Archeological Society
as a Caddo ceramic scatter
(Walters 2006). It is located
on a sandy upland that drains
into the Sulphur River just
downstream of the Wright
Patman Lake dam.

The site ranges from 231 to 241 ft amsl (70.4 to 73.5 m amsl), and is lightly to moderately
wooded with a pine overstory and an understory of dogwood and Carolina buckthorn. Just
south of the site is an eight-foot chain link fence blocking vehicular traffic from the county
road that runs south of the site. To the west of the site is a paved lot for ongoing construction.
Soils within the site are Eastwood series. Surface visibility in the area is about 10 percent due
to the mat of pine needles.
During Walters’ visit, he noted Caddo ceramics in the construction yard to the west and more
exposed along the road to the south (Walters 2006). During EComm’s investigation, no surface
artifacts were observed despite a walk-over of the parking lot, which was outside the current
survey parcel.
Fifteen shovel tests were excavated in order to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition
and to delineate site boundaries (Figure 4-17). Six lithics and 10 ceramics were recovered
between 0 and 60 cmbs in six of the 15 shovel tests (Table 4-5). All ceramics recovered during
shovel testing dated to the Late Caddo period. A high percentage of the sherds are fine wares
as opposed to utilitarian wares. While it is not unusual for Caddo habitation sites to contain
significant quantities of fine wares, this limited ceramic sample may suggest that the occupation
of 41CS333 may have been more ceremonial than solely residential. A detailed analysis of the
ceramics recovered within the site is presented in Appendix F.

4.3.2 41CS339
41CS339 is a 48 x 14-m historic site located on the northern slope of a terrace that drains into
the Sulphur River just downstream of the Wright Patman Lake dam. The site ranges from 215
to 225 ft amsl (65.5­to 68.6 m amsl), and the area is heavily wooded with a mixed hardwood
overstory and a scrubby understory of Carolina buckthorn. Just upslope from the site is an
area that has been used for unauthorized dumping. Soils within the area are Eastwood series.
Surface visibility in the area is nearly 0 percent.
41CS339 is part of a 100-acre tract within the B. Stewart Survey. The land was purchased by the
United States government in 1953 from J. L. Blalock. The land had been in the Blalock family
since 1880, when John W. Blalock bought it from Peter Hall (Cass County Deed Records Vol.

U-3, p.116). John W. Blalock
lived on the land until his
death; J. L. was likely his
son, though this could not be
confirmed, as neither John
W. nor J. L Blalock appears
in census records for Cass
County between 1880 and
1930.
Six shovel tests were
excavated on the site; all
six tests were negative.
However, four features were
noted (Figures 4-18 and
4-19). Each feature consists

siltstone/mudstone
rocks
ranging in size from 20 to
100 cm. No artifacts were
observed in association with any of the four features. Feature 1 measures about 4 x 2 m, is
about 60 cm high, and consists of rocks 30–120 cm in size. Feature 2 is 3.3 x 2.8 m and is
about 40 cm high; it consists of rocks 20 to 90 cm in size. The eastern edge of the feature is
straight and is oriented nearly north–south. Feature 3 measures about 5 x 3 m and is about
100 cm high. It consists of rocks ranging from 20 to 100 cm in size. The feature’s long axis
is oriented east–west and the eastern edge of the feature appears to be straight. Feature 4
measures about 1 x 1 m and is about 35 cm high, with rocks 15–35 cm in size. This pile is
much smaller than the first three features and its rocks appear to be stacked to some degree.
Interpretation of the four rock features is problematic. They do not appear to be prehistoric.
Neither do they appear to be structural foundations; this interpretation is supported by the
complete lack of associated artifacts. The slope and landform argue against burial cairns,
marker cairns, or push piles associated with field clearing. The features are possibly related
to the construction of the dam.

and were investigated with 14 additional shovel tests. The previously recorded location of site
41CP251 was surveyed and shovel tested, but no cultural materials were found; the tactics
used to locate previously recorded sites are presented in Section 3.1. In addition, one new
cultural resource site (41CP492) was documented. See Appendices B and C for the locations
and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Highway 259 A parcel. Maps showing

5.2.1 41CP251
Site 41CR251 was recorded in 1997 by LL&C. The site was described as a 15 x 50-m, lowdensity prehistoric lithic scatter that was bisected by a modern road. As shovel testing yielded
only one chert nodule and
charcoal from a single
shovel test, the site was
recommended as ineligible
for nomination to the NRHP.
EComm
archeologists
inspected the location on
record and observed no
surface artifacts. About 15
m southwest of the plotted
coordinates was a slight
70–100-cm rise out of the
swamp that was bisected by
a creek (Figure 5-2). It was
later determined that the
aforementioned road was in
fact this creek, at least during

the wet season. Six shovel
tests were dug in this site
area, but all were negative. Despite these negative results, the location tested matches the
description of the original site location as recorded in 1997 by LL Consultants.

5.2.2 41CP492
Site 41CP492 is a 90 x 20-m historic site of recent historic- to early modern-age situated on
an unimproved road that is not noticeable while on site. The site is a scatter of historic to
early-modern household refuse. The typical vegetation in the site is oak with an understory
of greenbriar and other vines. Soils within the site are Iuka series. Surface visibility is
approximately 30 percent. The site is flat except for the area along the creek to the east, which
has created a berm of about 80–120 cm high. To the west of the site is a swamp with opaque
water; to the east is Roberts Branch, a slow-moving creek flowing north (Figure 5-3).
41CP492 is part of triangle of land located on the Houston Mckee Survey. According to
information provided by the USACE, the land around 41CP492 was purchased by the US
government from Hattye Phillips sometime around 1953. Prior to this, W. T. Conner Jr. owned
the land (Upshur County Deed Records Vol. 472, p. 354), having inherited it from his father
W. T. Conner. Sr. Conner Sr. acquired the property in 1895 from John H. Spearman during a
land auction (Camp County Deed Records Vol. K, p. 343). Title history prior to 1895 was not
researched.

In the center of the site
and along the dirt track is
a concentration of historic
artifacts including cans, glass
bottles, glass jars, plastic
items, iron buckets, stove
parts, and miscellaneous
other

debris
(Figure 5-4). Approximately
300 items were visible, but

on the site, strongly suggests
a secondary deposit. A
sample of these surface items
was recorded. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site boundaries. Only one shovel test was positive. This test (ST 4)
was in middle of the artifact concentration and returned a total of 23 historic artifacts between
0 and 20 cmbs.
In the northern portion of the site, a small concrete feature was observed. This feature was
roughly rectangular in shape and measured approximately 1 x 1.5 m. The surface of the
concrete was eroded and rough with numerous cobble clasts exposed. ST 6 was dug near this
feature but contained no artifacts. Interpretation of the feature, and its association with the
artifact concentration, is uncertain.
The artifacts present on 41CP492 were likely discarded from a mid-twentieth-century rural
domestic homesite. The diversity of items observed—medicine bottles, soda and alcohol
bottles, tableware, toys, canning jars, and furniture—suggest that the artifacts were discarded
by a household with children. Plastic toys and other items are no earlier than the mid-twentieth
century. Of the artifacts, the bottles are most useful for dating. While not all could be successfully
dated, none are earlier than the 1940s, and the most recent dates to 1965. Moreover, virtually
all of the identifiable glassware represents products with national distribution, such as Dr.
Pepper, Milk of Magnesia, mentholatum, and Listerine.
Bottle makers’ marks from artifacts found at the site likewise represent nationally produced and
distributed wares. EComm archeologists identified Ball mason jars made in Muncie, Indiana,
in shovel tests and on the surface. They also found two soda bottles made by the Liberty Glass
Company of Sapulpa, Oklahoma, and one Dr. Pepper bottle made by Owens Illinois at its
plant in Waco on the surface of the site (Lockhart 2000; Lockhart et al. 2005). All of these

products reflect the well-established patterns of product distribution and consumption typical
of mid-twentieth-century America.
The other artifacts from 41CP492 are also fairly representative of items originating from a
mid-twentieth-century rural domestic occupation. All of the ceramic tableware is undecorated
plain whiteware, reflecting the tendency toward utilitarianism. A few fragments of salt-glazed
stoneware were probably from mixing bowls or crocks commonly used in rural kitchens. One
fragment of a green carnival glass bowl or saucer, an item that was relatively inexpensive, is
the most decorative piece in the assemblage.
All of the artifacts from 41CP492 appear to date after the time when the US government
acquired the property. The artifacts appear to be a secondary dump and the original source of
the artifacts is unknown.

5.3	Highway 259 B Parcel
The Highway 259 B parcel totaled 58 acres and was completely inventoried using 40 shovel
tests, for a density of 0.69 shovel tests per acre. All shovel tests were negative. No cultural
resource sites and no isolated occurrences were present within the parcel. A typical landscape
is shown in Figure 5-5: a broad, low, flat area with standing water. See Appendices B and C for
the locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Highway 259 B parcel.

CONCLUSIONS
6.1 	Summary
This cultural resources inventory investigated six separate parcels in five counties of East Texas.
Three parcels were at Wright Patman Lake in Bowie and Cass counties, and three parcels were
at Lake O’ the Pines in Camp, Marion, and Upshur counties. The sample consisted of 1,394
acres and the parcels ranged in size from 43 to 523 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian
inventory accompanied by excavation of 1,030 shovel tests, including 913 tests excavated on
transects, and 117 additional shovel tests to investigate sites or isolated positive tests. Tests
were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cmbs.
Shovel testing density for tests excavated on survey transects was 0.65 tests per acre.
The inventory investigated nine archeological sites, including two previously recorded sites
and seven newly discovered sites. No historic buildings or structures greater than 50 years
old were present in any of the inventory parcels. Of the 1,030 shovel tests dug within the six
parcels, 30 tests were positive, for an overall yield of 0.03 percent (Table 6-1). Twenty-eight
of these positive tests were on the nine sites and two were isolated tests not clearly associated
with any site. The remaining 1,000 tests were negative, including 911 negative tests that were
dug on transects and 89 negative tests on sites or around isolated positive shovel tests.
Of the two previously recorded sites, the field inventory relocated and investigated one site, but
surface inspection and shovel tests were negative for cultural resources. The other previously
recorded site was successfully relocated and re-recorded. Together with the seven newly
discovered sites, the survey documented a total of nine sites.
Only three of these nine recorded sites yielded temporally sensitive artifacts, consisting
of prehistoric ceramics and lithics from one site and historic material from two sites. The
prehistoric ceramics (41CS333) were grog, grog/grit, and grog/bone-tempered Caddo and date

to the Late Caddo period (AD 1400–1680). Both of the historic sites (41CP492 and 41CS339)
date to the middle decades of the twentieth century.

6.2 	Management Recommendations
The eligibility of any given archeological site for nomination to the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s significance, or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known—or are
suspected—to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against
a set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.
These research questions are discussed in the planning document for East Texas (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993) and summarized in section 3.5 Historic Contexts.
The one previously recorded site that was investigated but negative for cultural resources
(41CP251) is considered to be ineligible for nomination to the NRHP; this recommendation
is in agreement with its original assessment by LL&L in 1997. The other previously recorded
site, 41CS333, is considered to be of unknown eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
Using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear site evaluation could not be reached
for four sites. At present, it is unknown whether or not these four sites (41BW756, 41BW757,
41BW759, 41CS333) may be eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and they should be protected
from adverse impacts. If they cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to
clearly determine NRHP eligibility. The remaining five sites (41BW755, 41BW758, 41CP251,
41CP492, 41CS339) are assessed as not eligible for nomination to the NHRP. Each of the nine
sites is discussed briefly below and a tabular summary is presented in Table 6-2.
41BW755 Ten shovel tests were excavated; two lithic flakes and one piece of lithic angular
debris were recovered between 0 and 20 cmbs in two of the shovel test units. Based on the overall
lack of features, diagnostics, and low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer
significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.
41BW756 Twelve shovel tests were excavated and a total of seven lithic flakes were recovered
between 0 and 20 cmbs in three of the shovel test units. No artifacts were observed on the
surface. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered
unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further
investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s
NRHP eligibility.
41BW757 Nine shovel tests were excavated and a total of four lithic flakes were recovered
between 0-20 cmbs in two of the shovel test units. No artifacts were observed on the surface.
Based on the limited data collection on the site, the NRHP eligibility status of 41BW757 should
be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical,
then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and
the site’s NRHP eligibility.

41BW758 is a multi-component site. Twenty-six shovel tests were excavated and a total of
56 historic artifacts and eight prehistoric artifacts were recovered between 0 and 40 cmbs
in ten of the shovel tests. Some historic artifacts were observed on the surface. Because the
artifacts recovered have very limited data potential, since site features are limited and the
site is not associated with any personages of local or national significance, 41BW758 is not
recommended as eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
41BW759 Twelve shovel tests were excavated and 19 lithics, two pieces of lithic shatter, and
one biface fragment were recovered between 0 and 80 cmbs in four of the shovel test units.
No artifacts were observed on the surface. Based on the limited data collection on the site, the
NRHP eligibility status of 41BW759 should be considered as unknown and the site should be
avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to
determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41CP251 is a previously recorded, low-density prehistoric site. No cultural resources were
observed on the surface. Six shovel tests were excavated at the location of record but all shovel
tests were negative. The site has an extremely low density of cultural material; therefore, it
is unlikely that further investigations of the site would yield significant data and the site is
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
41CP492 contains a surface scattering of late historic to early modern artifacts. A representative
sample inventory of the surface artifacts was conducted and eight shovel tests were excavated.
Artifacts were found between 0 and 20 cmbs in one of the eight shovel tests. Analysis of the

Conclusions

collected artifacts and the sample inventory dates to site to the early- to mid- 1960’s, too recent
to be considered for nomination to the NRHP; further investigations within the site will not
produce significant data. No further archeological work is warranted.
41CS333 is a previously recorded Caddo site. The site was relocated next to a parking lot
behind a chain link fence. A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated and 10 ceramics, four
lithic flakes, and two pieces of lithic shatter were recovered in six shovel tests between 0 and
60 cmbs. Analysis of the ceramics resulted in a Late Caddo date for this site, as well as a high
percentage of fine ware versus utilitarian ware, which could suggest this is a ceremonial site.
The NRHP eligibility status of 41CS333 should be considered as unknown and the site should
be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to
determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41CS339 is an area on a slope where four large piles of rock were found. Some of these
piles have straight edges, indicating human interaction with the rocks. Six shovel tests were
excavated around the four features; all were negative for artifacts. Based on the overall lack
of diagnostics and zero artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant
questions regarding the use of the land or local archeology. As a result, it is recommended as
not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further research is recommended.

Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis

Appendix F Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis

Introduction
A total of 10 prehistoric ceramic artifacts from 41CS333 were examined and described (Figure
F-1). The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and
decorative techniques. The data collected from the sherds, along with comments about unique
characteristics, are presented in Table F-1. Interpretation was broad as the sample size was
small. All of the artifacts were collected from shovel tests. The ceramic description and analysis
found that the decorations and temper suggest most of the sherds came from Late Caddoan and
both utilitarian and fine-ware vessels; although, the greater number of fine-wares suggest more
ceremonial (e.g., a cemetery) and less utilitarian activity on the site.

Definitions
Sherd attributes included collection data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel
parts were described as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally
thicker cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel.
No rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprise the
surface of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing
the sherd in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5-millimeter (mm) separation.
Size was determined as the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured in
millimeters with calipers as the maximum perpendicular distance between the interior and
exterior surfaces of the sherd by pinching the thickest portion of the sherd between parallel
edges of the calipers.
Vessel manufacture description included examining temper and firing techniques. For
this analysis, temper was bone, grit, or grog. Temper was observed using a reflective light
microscope set at 25x magnifications. Bone temper was identified by several white angular
inclusions in the vessel paste. Grit temper was identified by angular inclusions that were not
quartz sand crystals, bone, or grog inclusions in the vessel paste. Grog was identified by several
fine angular inclusions of fired clay in the vessel paste. Firing was described using Teltser’s
(1993:530–543) article with a chart of oxidization patterns in sherd cross sections.
Decoration techniques described included decoration type, location, and surface treatment.
Decoration types included in the sample are engraved, excised, red slip, and plain categories
for this analysis. Only one sherd contained decorative elements distinctive enough to relate to
a specific vessel type. Without decorative elements only manufacture data were obtained. As
stated in Suhm and Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only decorated around
the rim leaving a large portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location was on both the
interior (concave) and the exterior of the sherd (convex) and surface treatments were described
as smooth with surfaces being created while the vessel was wet. Some sherds did show tool
marks from manufacture that were not decorative elements; these are described with the
individual sherd comments in Table F-1.

Sample Descriptions
Site 41CS333 ceramic sherd sample included 10 specimens divided into four rim and six body
fragments. Sherd sizes ranged from 10 to 30 mm with seven of the sherds near 25 mm in
size. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of three (30 percent) of the sherds: one
rim sherd with a red slip on the interior surface, and two sherds with engraved lines. The red
slip is on the interior surface of the rim and extends to the rim where it is eroded or eroded.
Of the two engraved sherds, one has two parallel lines roughly 5 mm apart. The second is an
engraved rim sherd with one line parallel to the rim on the interior surface and two parallel
lines 7 mm apart on the exterior surface. One of the exterior lines has a series of small pendant
triangles. The orientation of the pendant triangles is most similar to the Ripley Engraved motif
drawn in Figure 6a of Thurmond (1990:37) and described as belonging to the Titus phase (AD
1500–1600) (Thurmond 1990:40 Table 8). The remaining seven sherds, two of which were
rims, were all plain with smoothed surfaces except for one plain rim which had a burnished
to polished surface on the lip. Temper inspection found 5 (50 percent) exclusively grog, two
bone/grog, and three grog/grit temper sherds. Thickness ranges from 4 mm to 7 mm with
no obvious correlations to decoration, temper, or firing. Firing in a reduced atmosphere was
predominant on 7 (70 percent) of the sherds followed by two sherds with mixed oxidization
and reduction, and only one sherd completely oxidized cross section.

Results
The analysis of ten ceramic sherds from 41CS333 found evidence of more fine-ware and less
utilitarian Late Caddoan ceramics. In general, the greater number of thinner ceramics with
engraved designs and fewer thick sherds with brushing or incised decoration is more indicative
of a cemetery or other ceremonial activity at the site.
Of the sherds examined, one was part of a carnated rim and one was decorated with a pendant
triangle motif. The pendant triangle motif found at 41CS333 is most similar to Ripley Engraved
(Thurmond (1990:37 Figure 6a; Shum and Jelks 1962:127 Plate 64b) with excised triangles
along a line. Ripley Engraved is commonly associated with the Titus phase (AD 1500–1600)
(Thurmond 1990:40 Table 8) is centered on the Western Cypress Creek Basin in the Lake O’
Pines area roughly 35 miles to the southwest of 41CS333 (Perttula 2004:394 Figure 13.26) but
can extend to the Red River (Suhm and Jelks 1962:127)
