Abstract
In August of 2014 prior to the construction of a proposed waste water line and lift station
near Buda, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and
shovel testing, in accordance with Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas
Historical Commission (THC) guidelines, of the 50-x-100-foot lift station tract, four
sections of proposed wastewater line totaling just over 1,156 feet (362 meters) in length
with a 50-foot (approximately 15-meter) wide construction easement, and a short section
(53.5 feet/16.25 meters with a 50-foot easement) of proposed wastewater line north of
Hillside Terrace. The remainder of the proposed wastewater line located in previously
disturbed roadways (18764 linear feet/5110 meters with 50 foot/15 meter construction
easement) was excluded from the archeological survey due to the existing level of
disturbance or plans to bore (415-linear-feet/126.5 meters). A total of 1.5 acres was
surveyed. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit Number 6979. Robin Benson Barnes served as Principal
Investigator and Project Archeologist and Julie Shipp served as Project Geoarcheologist.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
No prehistoric or historic sites were discovered during this cultural resource survey. The
proposed wastewater alignment was disturbed by erosion along an unnamed tributary of
Andrews Branch, and a small section of the wastewater alignment was disturbed by
previous road construction and installation of utilities. Based on the results of this
archeological survey, no further archeological work is recommended.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Buda is proposing to install new wastewater lines in the Hillside Terrace
neighborhood. Hillside Terrace is located just east of I-35, south of Hillside Terrace, north
of Circle Drive/Suffield Drive, and south of the City of Buda within the Extra-Territorial
Jurisdiction (ETJ) of the City of Buda in Hays County, Texas. The proposed project
funded through the Texas Water Development Board Clean Water State Revolving Fund
Equivalency Program would connect the dwellings to the centralized sewage collection
system in order to allow for the removal of undersized on-site sewage facilities that were
determined to contribute to pollution of the Plum Creek downstream. The project Area of
Potential Effects (APE) includes the proposed location of a wastewater line primarily
along existing roadways within the Hillside Terrace neighborhood, the construction of a
50-x-50-foot (approximately 15-x15-meter) lift station within a 50-x-100-foot
(approximately 15-x-30-meter) tract south of the neighborhood, and the installation of
53.5 feet (16.25 meters) of wastewater line across Hillside Terrace (FM 133) on the north
side of the Hillside Terrace neighborhood (Figures 1 and 2). Two, mostly overlapping,
options for installation of the wastewater line were included in the APE because
construction plans had not been finalized.
Areas surveyed include the 50-x-100-foot lift station tract, four sections of proposed
wastewater line located in an area mapped as Tinn soils within a drainage floodplain
totaling just over 1,156 feet (362 meters) in length with a 50-foot (approximately 15
meter) wide construction easement, and a short section (53.5 feet/16.25 meters) of
proposed wastewater line north of Hillside Terrace. A total of 1.5 acres was surveyed.
The 415-linear-foot (126.5-meter) section located on the southern end near the proposed
lift station will be bored and, therefore, did not require survey. Due to the level of
disturbance on the existing roadways, the portions of the proposed wastewater line
located within the previously disturbed roadways (18764 linear feet/5110 meters with 50
foot/15 meter construction easement) were excluded from the archeological survey.
This investigation consisted of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed Hillside
Terrace wastewater line and lift station pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC 26.20[2]). The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography,
shovel testing, data analysis, and report preparation in accordance with THC and CTA
standards and with the Memorandum of Understanding between the THC and the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB).

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1
Environmental Setting
The project area lies within the Northern Blackland Prairies of the Texas Blackland
Prairies Ecoregion as delineated and defined by the Ecoregions of Texas (Griffith et al.
2007). This ecoregion is characterized by natural prairie vegetation and fine-textured,
clayey soils. More specifically, the Northern Blackland Prairies encompass
approximately 300 miles and historically was a large span of tallgrass prairie vegetation.
Factors that were important in shaping the tallgrass vegetation within the Blackland
Prairies were the grazing of bison and frequent fires throughout the landscape. The fires
hindered invading woody species and encouraged growth for grasses and forbs while the
grazing bison dispersed seeds in disturbed soils, trampled organic matter, and consumed
prairie grasses. Farming within the Blackland Prairies replaced ranching in the late 1800s
and early 1900s and ended the tallgrass prairie communities. Expanding urban and
suburban areas have transformed the region as well (Griffith et al. 2007). Vegetation
within the Blackland Prairie consists of tall grassland with bunch grasses such as Indian
grass, big bluestem, switchgrass, and eastern gamagrass. Species including elm, pecan,
cottonwood, and hackberry are found along waterways (McMahan et al. 1984).
2.2
Soils
Soils in this area are classified as the Heiden-Houston Black association, which consists
of deep, gently sloping to sloping soils over clay and shale on uplands of the Blackland
Prairie (SCS 1982). Five soil units occur within the subject area:
Altoga silty clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded (AgC3) â This complex is a deep, gently
sloping soil on convex, smooth slopes of low hills. Small gullies less than 3 feet deep and
generally 500 to 1,000 feet apart are scattered throughout the areas. The surface layer is
typically grayish brown, moderately alkaline silty clay about 7 inches thick. The upper
part extends to a depth of 13 inches and is light brownish gray, moderately alkaline silty
clay. The lower part of the subsoil extends to a depth of 36 inches and is a light gray,
moderately alkaline silty clay that has a few soft masses and rounded concretions of
calcium carbonate. The next layer to a depth of 60 inches is white, moderately alkaline
silty clay. The Altoga silty clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded, is well drained.
Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (HeB) â This complex is a deep, gently sloping soil
mainly on upland ridges in the Blackland Prairie Land Resource Area. The surface area is
typically a dark grayish brown clay that is about 16 inches thick. The layer below extends
to a depth of 63 inches and is grayish brown clay that has light yellowish brown and olive
mottles. The underlying layer to a depth of 72 inches is mottled grayish brown, pale
yellow, and olive yellow shaley clay. The soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous
throughout. The Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is well drained.

4

Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded (HeC3) â This complex is a deep, gently
sloping soil on convex side slopes on low hills and ridges on uplands in the Blackland
Prairie Land Resource Area. Shallow gullies that are 1 to 4 feet deep and 200 to 500 feet
apart appear in all mapped areas. The surface layer is typically dark grayish brown clay
that is about 13 inches thick. The layer below, which extends to a depth of 58 inches, is a
grayish brown clay. The underlying material to a depth of 80 inches is pale yellow,
shaley clay that has brownish yellow and olive yellow mottles. The soil is moderately
alkaline and calcareous throughout. The Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded, is
well drained.
Houston Black, 1 to 3 percent slopes (HoB) â The Houston Black series consists of a
deep, gently sloping soil on narrow ridgetops and long smooth foot slopes on uplands in
the Blackland Prairie Land Resource Area with mostly convex slopes. The soil to a depth
of about 50 inches is typically very dark gray clay. To a depth of 77 inches the soil is a
grayish brown clay. The underlying material is yellowish shaley clay. The soil is
moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout and is moderately well drained.
Tinn clay, frequently flooded (Tn) â This complex is a deep, nearly level soil on flood
plains along small streams. The surface layer is typically dark gray clay about 25 inches
thick. The layer below that, to a depth of 80 inches, is a grayish brown clay. The soil is
moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout. The soil is somewhat poorly drained.
2.3
Geology
The project area lies within the Pecan Gap Chalk formation. The Pecan Gap Chalkâs
thickness is approximately 200 feet. The Chalk is medium gray in color and weathers to a
light gray and white. The lower portions of this chalk contain well rounded quarts grains
and grades upward to a chalky marl with micro granular calcite suspended in a clay
matrix (Barnes 1974). Holocene alluvium and Holocene and Pleistocene terrace deposits
consisting of sand, silt, and clay overlie the chalk marl (Griffith et al. 2007: 65).

The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
The area that is now Hays County was relatively well traveled even during the earliest
periods of European contact in Texas. The land lay near the main Spanish route from San
Antonio to the East Texas missions as well as the El Camino Real route from the Rio
Grande Valley to north of Sante Fe and was thus commonly traversed beginning as early
as the sixteenth century (National Park Service 2014). Two Spanish missions were
founded on the San Marcos River in the 1750s, although permanent settlement was not
attempted until the early 1800s. Following the establishment of Mexicoâs independence
from Spain, the government of Coahuila and Texas began distributing land grants in the
area in an effort to encourage settlement (Cecil and Greene 2010).
By the late 1840s, settlement of the area was well underway, and in 1848 Hays County
was formed from part of Travis County. San Marcos was named the county seat, and the
population of the county grew quickly, from 387 people in 1850 to 2,126 people in 1860
(Cecil and Green 2010). A stage line traveling between Austin and San Antonio in 1848
crossed Hays County, encouraging settlement. Between 1848 and 1890, settlers built and
operated sawmills, cotton gins, gristmills, a shingle mill, a beef packing plant, churches,
and schools. During the Civil War, Hays County favored secession and contributed men
and food for the Confederate cause. Cattle raising and farming were the primary sources
of income during the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth. The railroad came to
Hays County in 1880, connecting San Marcos with Austin and later with San Antonio; as
was typical at the time, the population increased rapidly with the building of the railroad
(Cecil and Greene 2010).
In 1881, the town of Buda was formally founded at the location of a railroad depot that
had been known as Du Pre (Greene 2010). The depot had been established in 1880 near
the town of Mountain City, which was rapidly depopulated as people moved closer to the
railroad. The new settlement near the depot became a popular dining stop for rail
travelers, and as Greene (2010) reports, âthe common explanation for the new name is
that it derives from Spanish viuda âwidow.ââ¦the name may refer to a pair of widows
who cooked at the Carrington Hotel in the 1880s.â The local economy relied on
providing supplies to surrounding farms and ranches, and the town was relatively
prosperous until the Great Depression, at which time the population fell by half, to about
300 people. Only as the city of Austin began its rapid growth in the 1980s did Budaâs
population rebound (Greene 2010).

Southwest Texas Normal School was founded in 1903 and became Southwest Texas
State University in 1969. It is now Texas State University. This university and other
learning institutions contributed to county income and population. Tourism has also been
a steady source of income for the county since the early twentieth century. Caves,
springs, and natural spas have attracted tourists, originally for their beauty and reported
healing properties and later because of a growing appreciation for environmental
protection. The unique habitats created by some of the natural springs in Hays County
provide homes for species of insects, salamanders, and fish that are found nowhere else
(Cecil and Greene 2010).
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological and Historic Sites databases, historic maps,
and records from TARL revealed that no sites have been recorded within the limits of the
proposed alignment, and four sites have been recorded within one kilometer of the
proposed project (Figure 4). Site information is summarized in Table 2.
Four previous surveys and four previously recorded sites are located within one kilometer
of the project area. A survey of the intersection of IH 35 and Hillside Terrace was
conducted by Blanton and Associates for TxDOT in 2009. No archeological sites were
located during the survey. The other three surveys resulted in the recording of four new
archeological sites.
Site 41HY394 was recorded by Horizon Environmental for the CR132 Realignment
Project. The site is located approximately one kilometer northwest of the project area, on
the west side of IH 35, overlooking the headwaters of the unnamed tributary to Andrews
Branch Creek. The site consisted of both historic and prehistoric components, and artifact
types included blue glass, colorless glass, whiteware, and two flakes of lithic debitage.
The site was determined ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places.
Site 41HY413 was recorded in 2005 by Horizon Environmental for the Horton Property
Project and is located approximately 700 meters north of the project area. The site is a
complex of seven structures associated with a historic farmstead that includes three
associated historic artifact scatters. Additionally, one prehistoric artifact was recovered
from the surface near the historic home. Materials observed included whiteware,
stoneware, whiteware with green transfer print, pearlware, redware, porcelain, two
complete clear bottles, clear bottle fragments, amethyst glass, cobalt blue bottle
fragments, a milky-white mason jar seal inside a metal lid, aquamarine bottle fragments,
aquamarine flat glass fragments, bricks, concrete pipes near the house and barn, a
porcelain insulator, iron plow parts, and one unidentified corner-notched chert tool. The
site was determined ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP by the investigators.

5.0 METHODS
Following a review of current archeological sites data and historical research, a
pedestrian survey of the previously described lift station and portions of the wastewater
line was conducted to locate any archeological or historical sites that may be adversely
affected by construction of the wastewater line and lift station. A short section of
approximately 23 meters (75 feet) of the proposed wastewater line within the floodplain
of the unnamed tributary was not fully surveyed due to inability to confirm right-of-entry.
However, this section of the proposed wastewater line is in the active floodplain, and
both ends of the segment were surveyed.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area.
A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical
sites that may be adversely affected by construction. The subject area was walked in
parallel transects spaced sufficiently to adequately cover the 50-foot-wide wastewater
line easement as well as the 100-by-50-foot lift station tract. Shovel tests were placed
along the APE in areas with potential for buried deposits. Recording methods included a
daily log, photography, the use of task-specific forms for recording shovel tests and
photographs, and the use of a handheld GPS. No artifacts were collected and no sites
were recorded.
Sub-surface testing was limited to shovel testing due to the shallow depth of deposits.
Shovel tests (n=3) were excavated in settings with potential for buried cultural horizons
or less than 30 percent ground surface visibility. The shovel tests were at least 30
centimeters (cm) in diameter and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits. The
shovel test levels were no thicker than 20 cm, and the excavated sediments were screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth or troweled through and sorted by hand depending upon
the clay and moisture content.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The APE consists of a short section of proposed pipeline north of Hillside Terrace, a lift
station tract located to the south of the residential developments, and proposed pipeline
along and within an unnamed tributary of Andrews Branch. No sites were discovered and
much of the APE was disturbed or within an active floodplain. Three shovel tests were
excavated, one within the proposed lift station tract and two adjacent to the unnamed
tributary (Figure 6, Table 3).
A short section of proposed wastewater line (53.5 feet/16.25 meters) located to the north
of Hillside Terrace roadway is located within the right-of-way (ROW) of Hillside
Terrace. The ROW has been disturbed by previous road construction and the installation
of a gas pipeline. In addition, portions of the ROW have been eroded due to run-off
channeled into a driveway culvert. No historic or prehistoric artifacts or features were
observed. Subsurface testing was not conducted due to the disturbed nature of the
deposits.

The proposed lift station is located to the south of Suffield Drive on the southern end of
the project area. The tract was covered by dense vegetation including rag weed, bois
dâarc trees, and woody shrubs. Even though the soils on the tract are Houston clay, which
has a low probability for containing intact cultural deposits, one shovel test was dug due
to the limited surface visibility. The shovel test (see Table 3) confirmed the presence of
Houston clays as indicated on soils maps. The soil appeared to be intact with increasing
levels of carbonate filaments with depth. No artifacts or other cultural features were
observed on the surface or in the shovel test.

Figure 7. Overview of the proposed lift station tract.

The soils within the portion of the wastewater line along an unnamed tributary of
Andrews Branch are mapped as Tinn soils. However, the field visit verified that the soils
in the portions of the APE paralleling the tributary have been eroded. Two shovel tests
were attempted in these areas and confirmed that the Tinn soils are no longer present (see
Table 3). The portions of the APE that cross the tributary are located within the active
floodplain of the tributary as evidenced by gravel deposits, recent trash caught in the
floodplain understory vegetation, and observed cut bank profiles. Intact deposits did not
appear present in this high energy environment.
No historic or prehistoric artifacts or features were noted in this portion of the APE.
Recent trash was observed along with the remnants of two trailers and a pre-fabricated
out building. Vegetation was extremely dense and included hackberry trees, stands of
ragweed, scrub oaks, and understory shrubs.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of the construction of a proposed wastewater line and lift station near Buda,
Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey and shovel
testing, in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines, of the 50-x-100-foot lift station
tract, four sections of proposed wastewater line totaling just over 1,156 feet (362 meters)
in length with a 50-foot (approximately 15 meter) wide construction easement, and a
short section of proposed wastewater line (53.5 feet/16.25 meters with a 50-foot
easement) north of Hillside Terrace. The remainder of the proposed wastewater line
located in previously disturbed roadways (18764 linear feet/5110 meters with 50 foot/15
meter construction easement) was excluded from the archeological survey due to the
existing level of disturbance or plans to bore (415-linear-feet/126.5 meters). A total of 1.5
acres was surveyed. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative
Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit 6979. No prehistoric or historic sites were
discovered and no further work is recommended.
It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural
features within a project area. Therefore, should previously unrecorded cultural resources
including human remains be discovered during the course of construction for this project,
the City of Buda will contact the Texas Historical Commission of the inadvertent
discoveries.
