ABSTRACT

Geoarchaeological Investigation of Natural Formation Processes to Evaluate Context of
the Clovis Component at the Gault Site (41BL323), Bell County, Texas. (May 2008)
Dawn Aileen Joyce Alexander, B.A., Purdue University
Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Michael R. Waters

Texas A&M University completed excavations at the Gault site (41BL323) in
Bell County, Texas, in the spring season of 2000. Located at the head of Buttermilk
Creek, past inhabitants have enjoyed perennial springs and a variety of natural resources
available in the immediate area, including high quality chert from the Balcones
Escarpment of the Edwards Plateau. Chipped stone material diagnostic of the Clovis
period was recovered during the TAMU block excavation, informally referred to as the
“Lindsey Pit,” from clay deposits approximately 35 cm thick. Natural agents that may
have impacted contextual integrity of the Clovis cultural deposits include stream action,
pedoturbation, and bioturbation. Artifact spatial analyses examined long axis
orientations and artifact degree of dip to identify non-random patterns that would result
from stream action. Vertical and horizontal relationships of refitting artifacts were
examined to evaluate post-depositional displacement.
Orientations of chipped stone artifact long axes and inclination were found to be
statistically random, with minor patterns that reflect the paleotopography. Thirty-three
groups of refitting artifacts were identified, none of which contained elements recovered

iv

from deposits more recent than the Clovis clays. Five groups have elements that appear
to come from both of the Clovis clay deposits, indicating a small degree of vertical
displacement. The results of this research indicate the clays bearing Clovis materials
retained a high degree of integrity such that the spatial patterns preserved in the
archaeological record at this location are the result of cultural activities and not natural
processes. Though time-consuming in the field and laboratory, additional fine-grained
analyses such as artifact orientation and refit studies provide separate lines of evidence
to account for natural processes that may have acted to obscure the original patterns of
the archaeological record, and our understanding of past human cultures.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I want to thank Dr. Waters and Dr. Shafer for the field experience at the Gault
site and their ongoing mentorship. I also thank Dr. Waters for providing the opportunity
to conduct this geoarchaeological research. For his geomorphic expertise and
contributions as the outside committee member, I thank Dr. Tchakerian.
None of this would be possible without the hard work of the Texas A&M
University 2000 and 2001 field school participants. Special thanks are given to
Charlotte D. Pevny for managing the subsequent data and notes associated with the
cultural material that was recorded, as well as the undergraduate students who
participated in Gault site post-excavation research. Ian Buvit was the primary
orientation data recorder during the field excavation and maintained meticulous notes
for use in the artifact orientation analyses. Dr. David Carlson provided expert guidance
through the orientation data analyses. Rose diagrams were created using Dr. Todd
Thompson’s Rose© software that is generously made available to students via the
internet.
The refit study required time and space, which can be scarce in any
archaeological laboratory. The first and second sets of the refit study were conducted in
laboratory space that was made available by Dr. Waters. The third set was completed in
Dr. Shafer’s laboratory. I am grateful to both for making space and their patience
during the course of the study. Two undergraduate students assisted with looking for
refits, and several graduate researchers identified refit groups while working on the

vii

Gault assemblage in their separate technological studies, including Charlotte Pevny, Bill
Dickens, Scott Minchak, and Damon Burden.
The majority of artifact photographs were artfully completed by Charlotte
Pevny. Jason Barrett initially digitized stratigraphic profiles from the Gault TAMU
excavations. Several colleagues provided additional Autocad support during my
subsequent work with Gault profiles, including J. Bryan Mason, Michael Crow, Scott
Minchak, and Guy DellaValle. Graduate Student Advisor Milissa Kennedy deserves
special mention for her assistance with essential paperwork and acting as a general point
of contact after I moved from College Station.
As director of the Center for Ecological Archaeology (CEA), Dr. Altson Thoms
initially welcomed me into the Anthropology Department and accepted my application
for employment. I thank Dr. Thoms and Ms. Patricia Clabaugh for the outstanding
experience working with the CEA in the field, laboratory, and with technical report
production. Sincere thanks are also given to colleagues, archaeologists and friends,
including Hope Leininger, Christy and Jim Pritchard, and Andi Stahman for stimulating
discussion and sharing of ideas. I also thank Bill Foley, Jr. for reading the manuscript
and providing comments. Finally, thanks to my mother and father for their
encouragement and support.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE
OF RESEARCH

Archaeologists today are concerned with much more than the artifact. To create
a fuller picture of past human behavior, researchers look beyond the artifact to the
artifact in its context. A much better understanding of past human behaviors can be
gained from the fragmented archaeological record when the human aspects are
considered as participants in an ecological system. Climate, environment, and
geomorphic landscape compose the backdrop for understanding past human lifeways
(Butzer 1982).
Context refers to the spatial patterns of artifacts and features that compose an
archaeological deposit. The material culture of the archaeological record is considered
to be in situ, or in primary context, if the patterns and spatial associations are the
reflection of human behavior.
Archaeology and the earth sciences are inherently tied. Once cultural artifacts
and features become part of the archaeological record, whether resting on the surface or
buried, they become particles of the sedimentary matrix and therefore subject to the
influences of same natural processes (Butzer 1982; Hassan 1985; Isaac 1967; Schiffer
1976, 1987; Shackley 1978; Shipman 1981; Villa 1982; Waters 1992).
____________
This thesis follows the style of American Antiquity.

2

This inherent relationship can be recognized historically during the study of
human prehistory. At any juncture where a site has the potential to rewrite current
models, geologists become the default referees responsible for verifying ages of the
deposits and their depositional environments. In 1858 human antiquity gained
acceptance after the archaeological finds at Brixham Cave, England, could be verified by
a geological group that included Charles Lyell (Rapp and Gifford 1985:4; Rapp and Hill
1998:5). In the New World, evidence for humans living during glacial times wasn’t
accepted until 1927 when the Folsom site in New Mexico was confirmed to be
geologically intact (Rapp and Gifford 1985:13; Rapp and Hill 1998:11; Waters 1992:8;
Willey and Sabloff 1993:141). Not until the last half of the twentieth century has the
concern for context moved beyond the level of implicit application into the mainstream
of archaeological methodology (Hester et al. 1997). In the 1970s geoarchaeology
emerged as a professional sub-discipline of archaeology aimed toward applying geologic
principles to achieve more comprehensive insights to the past cultural behaviors that are
preserved in the archaeological record (Butzer 1982; Schiffer 1987; Waters 1992).
Contextual archaeology, as outlined by Butzer (1982), requires a
multidisciplinary approach to the research design, calling for archaeologists to
incorporate studies of the non-cultural aspects of a site in order to expand our
understanding of the cultural groups gained from knowledge of the environment in
which they lived. Contextual archaeology applies a systems model that is divided into
two general categories, cultural and non-cultural, which are divided into four
components. The cultural component is represented by artifacts and features. The non-

3

cultural aspect includes biological (flora and fauna) and non-biological (physical
landscape) components. Each of these provides proxy data for reconstructing the fourth
non-cultural component, climate. The sum of these cultural and non-cultural facets is
the ecosystem (Butzer 1982).
The basis for understanding this paradigm is recognizing that the constituents of
the ecosystem are dynamic, interacting, and striving for equilibrium. Archaeologists
study the human adaptations within a particular environment, and look to understand
reasons behind change in the cultural process. Change may occur as a result of
disequilibrium within the cultural component either within groups or between groups,
and between one or more of the non-cultural components. Archaeobotanists,
zooarchaeologists, and geoarchaeologists provide specific expertise for examining noncultural subsystems with the goal of answering archaeological questions (Waters 1992:45).
Several authored and edited texts covering the subject of geoarchaeology are now
available. Each one offers a slightly different definition for the scope of contemporary
geoarchaeology (Goldberg et al. 2006; Rapp and Gifford 1984; Rapp and Hill 1998;
Stein and Farrand 2001; Waters 1992). However all agree on the fundamental
objectives: to reconstruct the past physical landscape and depositional environment for
artifact-bearing deposits, examine the natural processes that result in preservation and
destruction of the original patterns of cultural behaviors, construct the absolute and
relative timeline of the sedimentary and archaeosedimentary deposits, and reconstruct
the changes in climate that are represented in the “dirt”.

4

Justification for This Research
This research is a geoarchaeological investigation of the TAMU 2000 excavation
area at the Gault site (41BL323) - a stratified, multi-component prehistoric site in central
Texas. There are two primary goals. The first is to reconstruct the landscape and
depositional environments reflected in the stratigraphic record. The second is to
evaluate the contextual integrity of those deposits by examining the natural processes
that culminated in the burial and preservation of deposits bearing Clovis materials.
Archaeologists concerned with drawing an accurate picture of past human
behaviors from the archaeological record will first consider the cultural and natural
processes that may have distorted the original patterns of artifacts and features left in
primary context. Disturbance may have occurred at the time artifacts left the human
hands that used them, when the artifacts were exposed on the ground surface, or as
sediment buried the location. The risk for disturbance continued after burial, with soil
developing processes that involve chemical and physical changes, activity by burrowing
creatures, and geomorphic processes. It is possible to undertake such an investigation
however because the disturbing processes operate under the law of uniformity for
geologic processes, which states that those processes active in the present are also the
processes at work in the past and that the results are observable and predictable.
The significance of Clovis archaeology has maintained momentum since the E.B.
Howard published his first excavations near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1930s
(Boldurian and Cotter 1999). The body of current research is vast and includes
investigations of new sites (e.g., Ferring 1995), the review of data or collections from

5

previous excavations (e.g., Boldurian and Cotter 1999), as well as regional syntheses
(e.g., Holliday 1997; see also Bonnichsen et al. 2006; Bonnichsen and Steele 1994;
Bonnichsen and Turnmire 1991, 1999; Soffer and Praslov 1993; West 1996).
Clovis as Early Americans
Paleoindian research through the 1960s supported the original model for Clovis
as the colonists of the New World: small bands of highly mobile and successful
mammoth hunters who traveled across the Bering Strait during the last glacial period,
continuing south to the continental United States through an ice-free corridor, and finally
exploding onto the fertile hunting grounds of the Great Plains (Boldurian and Cotter
1999:26-27). With improved methods and technology in archaeology and related subdisciplines such as paleobotany and zooarchaeology, the more recent evidence indicates
that Clovis people were more generalized hunter-gatherers who likely adapted regionally
to specifically available resources. Radiocarbon dates bracket the Clovis occupation in
the Great Plains and Southwest between 11,500 and 10,900 years B.P. (Haynes 1993).
Waters and Stafford (2007) re-examined radiocarbon samples from Clovis sites with
secure geologic context. Their work refined the Clovis time period to between 11,050
and 10,800 years B.P.
Clovis points have been reported from coast to coast in the United States,
anywhere south of the periglacial boundary that existed at the southern border of Canada
(Meltzer 1993). The majority of these reports are isolated finds from archaeological
surveys or in collection inventories provided by prehistory enthusiasts. Either way, their
widespread presence prompted archaeologists to consider, and reconsider, the possibility

6

of a continent-wide adaptation (Meltzer 1993). Similar to our pursuit of understanding
who Clovis people may have become, the question of Clovis origins or the case for
earlier human occupations in the New World remains tentative and unsolved.
Archaeologists must continue to search for insights into cultural chronologies via
radiocarbon dating of in situ materials and stratified occupations whenever possible
(Waters and Stafford 2007).
Stratified sites are rare (Haynes 1993:219), considering nationwide reports of
isolated finds and “whenever possible” must be recognized as a significant limitation of
the extant research – many Clovis sites in the extant research are fortuitous and not the
result of a systematically designed survey that applies methods appropriate for
identifying late Pleistocene deposits where cultural materials may be preserved . Many
of the known sites are located in the Great Plains and Southwest regions of the United
States and are associated with extinct large mammal bones. This is no surprise when we
review the history of Paleoindian archaeology – many sites were revealed during
droughts that facilitated erosional conditions and exposed late Pleistocene sediments
bearing highly visible bones of mammoths and bison. These are the kill and scavenge
sites that provided the foundation for the traditional Clovis model as mammoth hunters
who were so successful they hunted the mammoth into extinction (Meltzer 1993).
Archaeologists strive to elucidate cultural associations between groups through
assemblage comparisons and technological analyses of diagnostic artifact characteristics,
and in the case of Clovis the primary diagnostic is its fluted point. The Clovis
assemblage also includes blades, large flake tools, sidescrapers, and endscrapers which

7

are technologically uniform despite the different environmental contexts in which they
are found. Dating to the late Pleistocene, Clovis people lived in an environment unlike
any known today. Ice Age megafauna such as camel, horse, giant sloth, and mammoth
lived in North America. The late Pleistocene has no modern analog for climate or
environments. Similarly, there isn’t a clear analog for Clovis people among today’s
hunter-gatherer groups. In our modern world, hunting and gathering societies no longer
have the option to move into unoccupied territories (Kelly and Todd 1988).
The environmental changes of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition would
have had severe repercussions for the archaeological record at that time, destroying
earlier sites and making their discovery even more challenging. Reconstructing the
depositional history of sedimentary sequences is crucial especially at sites bearing Clovis
cultural material. If the previously existing sediments were removed, the archaeology
was removed with it and lack of evidence for humans before Clovis peoples is a result of
natural processes and not a reflection of behavioral activity.
Clovis as Texans
Texas offers researchers unique opportunities for Paleoindian studies as the
geographic meeting of the eastern woodlands, northern plains, and western desert
regions in the United States. In each cardinal direction, central Texas offers transitional
environments and providing a wider range of resources than would be found in a more
homogenous environment. The Edwards Plateau in marks the southern boundary of the
mid-continental Great Plains region and the sub-region of the Southern High Plains of
northwest Texas and eastern New Mexico, where several significant Paleoindian sites

8

have been recorded since Clovis was established (Bousman et al. 2004; Haynes 1993).
The eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau is characterized as an ecotonal environment
where valuable resources could be found, such as stream valleys with abundant
resources for food and shelter and limestone outcrops of the high-quality Edwards chert
(Collins 2002).
This is where the Gault site is found. This open-air site is situated in the ecotone
between the Edwards Plateau and Post Oak Savannah (Hester et al. 1998). Located at
the headwaters of Buttermilk Creek, perennial springs and varied resources have
attracted human inhabitants to the area for more than 10,000 years. Alluvial processes
are the primary agent responsible for the stratified cultural deposits, although deposition
over time has been differential so that the earliest deposits are thicker than the more
recent deposits. Additionally, the last 100 years has witnessed non-scientific
excavations by persons collecting Archaic period projectile points that could be found in
the upper deposits (Hester 1998). Fortunately for Paleoindian researchers, the deposits
beneath the extensive burned rock middens containing these point types went relatively
untouched. Amidst the debate of who were the First Americans, the Gault site offers a
unique research opportunity as one of the few known quarry and residential sites to
further our understanding of these early inhabitants of North America.
Objectives
In the spring of 2000, students from Texas A&M University, College Station,
completed field excavations at the Gault site under the direction of Drs. Harry Shafer
and Michael Waters, in cooperation with Dr. Michael Collins of the University of Texas.

9

A multi-component archaeological resource, Gault proved to contain an exceptional
Clovis component preserved in fine-grained sediments at the lowest stratigraphic
position, just above bedrock.
This research was undertaken to provide the foundation for spatial analyses of
the significant archaeological record that was recorded at this location. My research
objectives were to:
(1) construct the temporal and spatial frame for the cultural layers of the TAMU
excavation block.
(2) examine the extent to which natural agencies may have influenced the
composition of the cultural material in the Clovis-age deposits at the time of their
deposition, as the artifacts were buried by sediment, and after they were buried.
This first objective follows contextual archaeological theory by placing the
cultural deposits in geochronologic sequence and determining the site’s location on the
geomorphic landscape (Waters 1992:11-12). The second objective evaluates the extent
to which natural processes may have altered the behavioral patterns originally left to
become part of the archaeological record. To obtain these objectives, I pursued two
research components.
The first component was to define the stratigraphy of the excavation area. From
the stratigraphic record the depositional history of the TAMU block excavation could be
reconstructed. Sediment and soil attributes were described and used to infer the site’s
position on the geomorphic landscape.

10

The second component comprised a taphonomical study of the Clovis
component. Artifact orientations were examined to identify patterns that would reflect
the influence of natural agencies during artifact deposition, while artifacts were exposed
on the surface, and as artifacts were buried with sediment. A refit study of the chipped
stone material recovered from the Clovis deposits was completed to identify patterns of
artifact vertical movement. Refitted artifacts reflect contemporaneity – a shared moment
of time between two conjoining pieces (Hofman 1992a; Villa 1982). By looking at the
horizontal spatial relationships of refitted artifacts it is possible to identify contemporary
activity areas. Vertical separation between refitting artifacts is an excellent method for
identifying post-depositional movement. The absence of conjoined pieces across
stratigraphic boundaries is an indication of better contextual integrity.

11

CHAPTER II
SITE LOCATION AND SETTING

Site Location
The Gault site is located in central Texas at the border of Bell and Williamson
counties in the upper reaches of Buttermilk Creek, approximately 72 km (45 miles) north
of the capital city Austin (see Figure 1). This is the eastern margin of the Edwards
Plateau called the Lampasas Cut Plain, where the Balcones Escarpment marks the
southern and eastern extents of the United States Southern Great Plains. The Balcones
Escarpment is a fault zone that was active during the Tertiary period resulting in uplifted
lower Cretaceous limestone sitting adjacent to upper Cretaceous marls and soft
limestone . The soft upper Cretaceous deposits were the alluvial source material for the
stream valleys that dissected the eastern edge of the plateau until were eroded to the
more resistant limestone that is found on upland surfaces today. Edwards chert, an
important prehistoric resource for tools, outcrops in tabular and nodular forms. The
uplands today are covered by thin soils with steep stony slopes. However just east of the
escarpment is the Blackland Prairie, the western-most sub-region of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. In this region soils are deep and underlain by upper Cretaceous marls and soft
limestone (Huckabee et al. 1977; Ellis et al. 1995; Sellards et al. 1932).
Buttermilk Creek is a first order stream with a catchement basin measuring 43
km2 (Gibson 1997). Its sinuosity measures 1.26 with a gradient of 8.5 m/km; it is
characterized as a braided/meandering stream type that is underfit to its stream valley by

12

a ratio of 1:3. It is incised into the Comanche Peak Limestone of the Fredericksburg
Group (Gibson 1997). Edwards Limestone, also of the Fredericksburg Group, is the
upland surface formation (Barnes 1979).

13

Site Setting
Climate
The climate is subtropical, humid with an annual precipitation average of 86cm
(34in) (Larkin and Bomar 1983). The highest rainfall values occur in spring and fall
when seasonal weather patterns are most active, resulting in river scours and mudflows
(Caran and Baker 1986). Temperatures range from July high average of 36 degrees
Celsius (96 degrees Fahrenheit) to January low average of 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees
Fahrenheit). The average growing season (frost-free days) is 260 days per year, with a
mild winter season period interspersed with brief cold spells in December and January
(Connor and Odintz 2006; Huckabee et al. 1977).
Flora and Fauna
Shallow soils of the uplands support tall grasses and oak, juniper, pine, and
mesquite trees; current land use involves ranching (cattle, goat, sheep), hardwood and
pine production, and limestone quarry activity. Deep soils on the prairie support mixed
grasses, and invading species of trees such as oak and mesquite. Farming is the
dominant use of land east of the escarpment (Huckabee et al. 1977).
The fauna in this area reflects the transitional environment that defines the
Balconian biotic province (Blair 1950; Riskind and Diamond 1986); species common to
adjacent biotic provinces reach the extent of their habitats here. The western
Chihuahuan species are at their easternmost extent in the xeric uplands of the Edwards
Plateau, while the Austroriparian species are living at the westernmost extent of the
Texan province in mesic environments that are found in broad stream valleys just east of

14

the escarpment. Species characteristic of the Tamaulipan and Kansan provinces are also
found to a lesser degree. Mammalian species include deer, bobcat, mountain lion,
coyote, gopher, squirrel badger, skunk, mink, weasel, raccoon, bat, armadillo, mole,
possum, rat, and mouse. Other terrestrial vertebrates include terrapins, lizards, snakes,
frogs, toads, and salamanders. Migratory birds and waterfowl are common; as well as
numerous freshwater fish species including gar, carp, catfish, bass, crappie, drum, and
shad (Riskind and Diamond 1986; Toomey et al. 1993).
Late Quaternary Environment
The environment of central Texas when Clovis groups were present was very
different than what exists today. Without a modern analogy, earth scientists use a
variety of proxy data sources to infer past climates and reconstruct environments. The
indirect nature of proxy sources introduces increased potential for error; however, we
can increase the accuracy of reconstructions by using multiple lines of evidence from
well-preserved data (Bousman 1998; Ellis et al. 1995). Current paleoenvironmental data
sources for central Texas include pollen from peat bogs (Bryant and Holloway 1984;
Bousman 1998), botanicals and faunal remains from caves and rockshelters (Lundelius
1986; Toomey et al. 1993), and stable carbon isotopes from alluvial sequences
(Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Nordt et al. 1994). The stratigraphic record preserved in
alluvial settings is also a valuable source for paleoenvironment reconstructions (Butzer
1982; Waters 1992). Two studies are available that are relevant to the Gault site
stratigraphy (Gibson 1997; Nordt 1992, 1995) and are discussed in detail in Chapter III.
The following summary of central Texas paleoenvironment is derived from Bryant and

15

Shafer (1977), Toomey et al. (1993), Collins (1995), and Bousman (1998), with
additional information where indicated.
During the full glaciation period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) the climate was cooler
and more humid than the modern climate. Central Texas was heavily forested with
deciduous trees, and supported now-extinct large mammals. Other faunal remains are
related to fauna now living in cooler and wetter environments to the north and east,
which indicates reduced seasonality. Pollen records from Patschke and Boriak Bogs in
east-central TX indicate mixed grassland and parkland with northern species, spruce, and
birch. Pollen from Friesenhahn Cave (near the Balcones escarpment) indicates open
savanna with mixed grass understory, and spruce along valley bottoms. Sediments from
Hall’s Cave are “dominated by red clays, with few coarse limestone fragments,
suggesting that limestone upland source areas were covered by deep red soils” (Toomey
et al.1993: 305) supports the findings of burrowing animals such as prairie dogs, pocket
gophers, moles, and other burrowers in cave faunas.
The late Pleistocene (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) is characterized as a warmer and
drier climate that supported a mosaic of open to closed plant communities. These
grasslands, oak woodlands, and pine forests exemplify the diversity supported in a more
temperate environment. Pollen evidence reflects continued warming and drying with
progressive loss of mesic vegetation and allowed the firm establishment of grasslands
and oak-hickory savannahs that are present today (Bryant and Holloway 1984). Cave
faunas indicate a rapid increase in summer temperatures from 15,000 to 13,000 yr B.P.
The masked shrew , present when summer temperatures are cooler, disappears from

16

Hall’s Cave record by ca. 14,500 yr B.P. while the cotton rat, common where summer
temperatures are warmer, appears ca. 12,500 yr B.P. Hall’s Cave also provides evidence
that effective moisture decreased and then increased again from 14,000-10,500 yr B.P.,
initial decrease reflected with the disappearance of the bog lemming. From ca. 12,500 to
10,500 yr B.P. the desert shrew increases in abundance compared to the least shrew –
which requires moister environments and now lives east of the escarpment – then
decreases in abundance suggesting a more mesic environment. The presence of pocket
gopher and prairie dog reflect mixed-grasses in central region of Edward’s Plateau.
Burrowing animals and red clay sediments in caves indicate that deeply weathered
reddish soils were still covering upland surfaces. These data support Haynes’ (1991)
proposal of a Clovis-age drought, supported by the stratigraphic and geomorphic
evidence at the Murray Springs site in southeastern Arizona. Many large mammals were
extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, marking the “gradual reorganization of extant taxa
to a more modern aspect” (Toomey et al. 1993: 308).
The early through middle Holocene environment (10,000 - 5,000 B.P.) continued
the drying pattern from the Late Pleistocene. Hall’s Cave microvertebrate taxa provide
evidence of “extirpation” of those requiring higher moisture requirements, and an
increased number of species that tolerate drier conditions. Pollen records indicate
increasing xeric conditions/decreasing effective moisture (Bonfire Shelter, Hinds Cave,
Boriack Bog). Pocket gophers, prairie dogs, and badgers are still found in cave faunas,
thus soil mantles were still present and vegetation probably consisted of tall and short
grasses. Cave sediments change however, after 8000 B.P. with increased vertical

17

accretion apparent at Hall’s Cave, color changes to dark reddish brown, a decrease in
clay content and an increase in transported limestone clasts. Conditions were such that
soil mantles were eroding, becoming darker, thinner, and stonier. Further, prairie dogs
are no longer present after this time (Toomey et al. 1993: 308).
The middle to late Holocene (5000-2500 B.P.) is proposed to be the driest period
experienced in the last 20,000 years, based on disappearance of taxa with high moisture
requirements from Hall’s Cave. Pollen records reflect continued warmer and drier
conditions through to present time with grasslands and the oak-hickory savannahs
becoming firmly established. Bryant and Holloway (1985) report evidence of a brief
return to mesic conditions at around 2500 B.P. from sources in southwest and west
Texas. Hall’s Cave shows more effective moisture than present with the return of the
woodland vole and eastern pipestrelle bat and an increase in least shrew versus the desert
shrew. Upland soil mantles have disappeared, leaving thin stony soils. Toomey et al.
(1993) conclude that the modern xeric climate is present in central Texas at 1000 B.P.
Bog pollen evidence indicates decreased moisture but still a mesic environment during
this time period (Collins 1995; Bousman 1998).
To summarize, multidisciplinary studies agree on large scale trends of
environmental change, however disagreement between studies becomes apparent at
smaller scales (Ellis et al. 1995). Conflicting models result from differential processresponse patterns. The critical threshold for change will be different for each kind of
data source. Equifinality introduces a second source for conflict – data sources can have
the same result (e.g., extinction) but for different reasons. Plant and animal communities

18

have changed in structure so that a modern analog for Pleistocene and late Pleistocene
environments does not exist. Species that are disharmonious in the modern environment
can be found together in the more temperate environment of the Late Pleistocene.
Indirect paleoenvironmental data shows that the last 20,000 years in central Texas have
been dynamic, with alternating warmer/drier and cooler/wetter conditions. Pollen and
stable isotope evidence reflects a forested landscape during full glacial time, a parklandwoodland environment during the late Pleistocene, and finally the grassland-parkland
environment known today (Bousman 1998; Collins 1995; Ellis et al. 1995; Nordt et al.
1994; Toomey et al. 1993).

CHAPTER III
STRATIGRAPHY

Introduction
Stratigraphy refers to the natural and cultural layers of materials that form an
archaeological site. Layers are defined by shared characteristics, most commonly
derived from lithology, pedology, or chronology. By viewing the layers in this geologic
framework, we are able to organize the excavated material in space and time (Waters
1992). At the TAMU excavation block, stratigraphic units were organized by lithology
and, in the absence of datable organic material, put into relative chronology. Positive
correlations with regional geoarchaeological investigations by Gibson (1997) and Nordt
(1992, 1995) supplement the Gault TAMU block excavation stratigraphy with relative
and absolute ages.
Methods
An area measuring 5 x 7 meters was excavated during the Spring 2000 fieldwork
(see Figure 2); additional trench and unit excavations were examined along the east 989
transect, southeast of the 2000 excavation area, the following year. Stratigraphic sections
are reported in this section for the east 982 and Trench 2 profiles, which capture the
sequence of lithostratigraphic units at this location. The stratigraphic record was
recorded by hand during field excavations and subsequently digitized using Autocad
2000 and 2002 software. Dr. M. R. Waters characterized the sediment and soil attributes
following Soil Survey Staff standards (1981).

20

Results
Seven lithostratigraphic units and one buried soil were identified, and a second
buried soil was confirmed during micromorphological analyses (Luchsinger 2002). Two
facies are evident in the east -982, -983,-985 and Trench 2 profiles: alluvial deposits
associated with overbank and floodplain formation, which interfinger with colluvial
deposits in the southern area of the excavation (see Figures 3 and 4). General unit
descriptions are reported in Table 1.
The basal unit of the excavation area consists of limestone bedrock. This
bedrock bench is unconformably overlain by unit 1 in the southern excavation units and
by unit 2 in the central and northern excavation units. Unit 1 consists of frameworksupported subrounded, irregular limestone cobbles that average 5-6 cm in diameter but
measure up to 25 x 15 cm. It meets with unit 2, a framework-supported gravel that
consists of small granules to cobbles (up to 30 x 15 x 15 cm). These cobbles are
subangular to subrounded limestone with chert nodules. The lateral contact between
units 1 and 2 indicates these are coeval.

Unit 2 is unconformably overlain by unit 3a, a lens-shaped clay deposit that is
thickest at its southern shape and thins to the north, in the direction of the current stream
channel. Unit 3a is also the oldest cultural layer in the profile, where chipped stone
artifacts, including diagnostic Clovis fluted points, were recovered from a the matrix of
light to dark brownish gray clay. Slickensides are found on wedge faces and ped faces.
Calcium carbonate nodules range from 0.5 to 3 cm. Chipped stone artifacts have
coatings on top surfaces, bottom surfaces, or both. Unit 3a pinches out as it meets unit 1
gravels, indicating coeval deposition. It is unconformably overlain by unit 3b, although
in some places the contact was difficult to discern. Unit 3b is a second artifact-rich layer
with a dark grayish brown clay matrix. Calcium carbonate nodules are common (ca. 20
percent) in this unit, round to irregular and slightly smaller (2-5 mm diameter) than those
encountered in the underlying unit. Chipped stone artifacts have calcium carbonate
coating that is thickest on the underside, increasing in concentration when nearer to the
contact with unit 3a. A light calcium carbonate coating is commonly found on the top of
artifacts.
An abrupt contact separates unit 3b from the overlying unit 4b. The lower
portion of unit 4b consists of massive clay that is brown (10 YR 5/3d) to light brownish
gray (10YR 6/2 w), slightly hard and sticky. Samples ranged from slightly to strongly
effervescent with few, soft, rounded to irregular calcium carbonate nodules 2-3 mm in
size. Redoximorphic features are very common and distinct. Manganese and iron stains
follow root channels. Few stones 1-8 cm in diameter are dispersed throughout, as well
as roots and root holes. Faint structure is characterized as weak, subangular blocky (fine

25

to medium). This lower portion of unit 4b grades upward and conformably to a clear
buried soil. The upper portion of 4b is characterized as Bk2 soil, a hard, very sticky,
plastic clay characterized as light brownish gray (10 YR 6/2d) to brown (10 YR 5/3w)
with moderate, fine subangular blocky structure. Samples are strongly effervescent with
abundant 1-10 cm calcium carbonate nodules that are irregularly shaped, soft, and
formed along ped faces. Fine iron stains are few to common, faint, and follow root
tracks. The upper boundary of unit 4c, the upper portion of the buried soil, was initially
thought to be transitional however the iron stains could not be traced into the overlying
unit. Unit 4c is characterized as Bk1, the top of the Royalty paleosol.
Unit 4c consists of grayish brown (10 YR 5/2d) to dark grayish brown (10 YR
4/2w) clay that is very sticky and plastic. Soil development appears as medium to coarse
subangular blocky structure that is strongly effervescent with 2-5 mm hard, round to
irregular calcium carbonate nodules. Smaller nodules are softer; some are 1 mm in
diameter. All calcium carbonate nodules occur on ped and fracture faces and are
especially common in the lower portion of this unit. Yellowish brown (10 YR 5/4d) iron
mottles occur mostly at the top of this unit and are characterized as few to common and
fine. An abrupt contact separates unit 4c from the overlying unit.
Unit 5b consists of silty clay that is light brownish gray/brown (10 YR 6/2d – 10
YR 5/3w), slightly hard, sticky, and plastic with strong coarse granular structure. It
strongly effervesces with irregular 2-5cm calcium carbonate nodules throughout the unit.
Peds are hard to slightly hard. Yellow (10 YR 7/8d) iron oxide mottles are common
throughout the unit (10 percent), 2-5 mm, fine distinct, and forming on exteriors of

26

calcium carbonate nodules. Chipped stone artifacts, subangular to subrounded limestone
cobbles (8.5 x 6 x 4 cm to 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm) are found in this matrix-supported unit.
They are rare and scattered in the profile and appear to be colluvial inclusions. Few
snails, bone fragments, roots and root hairs are also observed.
Unit 6b1 consists of silt to clayey silt characterized as grayish brown/dark
grayish brown (10 YR 5/2d – 10 YR 4/2w) that is slightly hard, slightly sticky, plastic,
with strong medium granular/crumb structure. It strongly effervesces. The contact with
the underlying unit is abrupt. The unit is dominated by mostly fragmentary but also
many whole Rabdotis shells, colluvial gravels that are subrounded, up to 14 cm long, 2-4
cm rounded to subangular gravels, firecracked rock, and chipped stone artifacts. Unit
6b1 is separated from Unit 6b2 by a distinct contact, however is considered part of the
“shell hash” described below.
Unit 6b2, referred to as the “shell hash”, consists of silty clay characterized as
gray/very dark grayish brown (10 YR 5/1d – 10 YR 3/2w), slightly hard, slightly sticky,
plastic, with moderate to coarse subangular blocky structure. It strongly effervesces and
includes 1-3mm irregular to rounded hard calcium carbonate nodules.
Unit 7b is a modern, black overbank deposit that is unconformably situated
above unit 6b2. It consists of clayey silt, very dark gray (10 YR 3/1d), black (10 YR
2/1w), and is characterized as very hard, slightly sticky and plastic, with strong coarse
subangular blocky structure. It is very slightly effervescent, with no visible calcium
carbonate nodules, along ped faces and small root voids.

Buttermilk Creek and Fort Hood Geoarchaeology
Few studies investigating the Late Quaternary geomorphic history of low order
central Texas have been completed. Two geoarchaeological studies are available that
(Gibson 1997; Nordt 1992, 1995) provide a chronological framework relevant to the
stratigraphy encountered during the TAMU 2000 Gault site excavation. Because Gault
materials were not preserved well enough to obtain radiometric dating, these studies are
summarized here to better define the Late Quaternary temporal frame and associated
environments. Correlations between these investigations and the Gault stratigraphy are
then discussed.
Buttermilk Creek
Gibson (1997) conducted a geoarchaeological study of Buttermilk Creek to
investigate the geomorphic influence of climate change on a lower-order stream in
central Texas, with the objective to develop an archaeological site predictive model
along Buttermilk Creek. From approximately 25 cutbank exposures, 5 terraces (T4 to
T0, oldest to youngest), 6 alluvial units, 1 buried soil, and 3 surface soils were identified.
For this discussion, I’ve focused on the alluvial unit descriptions.
All alluvial units rested on bedrock except T2, where the Solona alluvium buried
the older Roden alluvium. A temporal frame for the Late Quaternary history was
constructed using absolute ages provided by two radiocarbon ages obtained from
charcoal samples. Alluvial units were correlated with regional stratigraphic studies as a
means to more precisely date units. Relative ages were incorporated using diagnostic
artifacts from the study area that had been recorded in situ.

28

The oldest unit is the Lankford alluvium, measuring approximately 7 m in
thickness. The Lankford consists of rounded river gravel deposits alternating with
overbank clay sediments. No cultural material was observed. This alluvium was
assigned a Late Pleistocene age of deposition based on the position of T4 relative to
other dated units on the landscape and for the absence of cultural material during this
investigation.
The second oldest unit is the Roden alluvium, averaging 3.5 m thick and resting
on a bedrock bench 2.5-3.5m above the modern channel. Moderately well-sorted
rounded gravels 60 to 70 cm thick compose the basal layer, overlain by 180 to 280 cm of
coarse sandy clay loam fining upward to very fine clay loam. A high percentage of
secondary calcium carbonate has cemented chert flakes and filaments are most dense in
the top of the Roden alluvium. Nodules replace filaments with depth, increasing in size
and density but disappearing at the parent material level. The Brown paleosol (Bk1 –
Bk2 – BC) caps the Roden and separates it from the overlying Solona alluvium.
The Solona sediments consist of channel and floodplain facies, but can be
characterized generally as coarse gravelly sediments when compared to the Roden
alluvium. Gibson (1997:52) theorizes the change to coarser sediments is either the result
of 1) a change in hydrological regimes, where the Roden alluvium reflects regular flow
of Buttermilk Creek and the Solona indicates a change to episodic and flashy flow, or 2)
a change in the alluvium source where fine materials have been depleted and coarser
sediments are now being eroded.

29

After a period of erosion and downcutting, the Lim alluvium was deposited. It is
topped by a surface soil, which is observed to maximum depth of 230 cm. The unit
averaged 4.3 m in thickness, with highly variable facies between the six exposures that
were recorded. Resting on a bedrock bench between 0.6 and 2m above the modern
channel, the Lim alluvium consists of several sandy strata that may or may not have a
thick gravel stratum as well. Bedding is classified as massive, reflecting vertical
accretion and, with abrupt boundaries between the coarse-grained deposits, indicates an
episodic hydrologic regime. One radiocarbon sample was obtained from an in situ
hearth approximately 1.4 m below the terrace surface (3895 +/- 150 B.P. [A-0565; wood
charcoal]). This age along with an Ensor projectile point recovered from the surface
provides evidence that deposition of the Lim alluvium took place between 5000 and
2300 B.P.
The Eden alluvium forms the next youngest terrace (T1), measured 2.8 to 3.3 m
in height from the creek bed. The alternating strata consist of sandy clay loam, silty clay
loam, and moderately well-sorted granule to pebble-sized rounded gravels, though
without any apparent fining sequences. One radiocarbon sample was obtained from
dispersed charcoal fragments (135+/-150 B.P. [A-9563; wood charcoal]). The soil on
the surface of T1 extends to a maximum depth of 1.2 m and is defined as a cumulic soil
since this surface floods every five to ten years. The beginning age for deposition of the
Eden alluvium is estimated at 2300 B.P., relative to abandonment of T2, and is
characterized as deposition by sporadic flow reflected in sandy and gravelly strata with
no bedding structures.

30

The Adams alluvium composes the modern floodplain. Recorded at one location
though observed at many others, it measured 1.8 m above the modern channel bed and
averages 2-3 m in width from the creek bank. This alluvial unit rests on bedrock at the
creek level, and comprises a fining upward sequence of rounded river gravels, fine sandy
clay loam, and clay loam, with a light sandy lens 3-4 cm thick within the uppermost 40
cm. The surface soil (S1) is characterized as weak and cumulic, developing as the unit
aggrades with deposition from a migrating, relatively regular flowing creek with very
low flow.
Fort Hood Military Reserve
Nordt (1992, 1995) completed geoarchaeological work at Fort Hood Military
Reserve in fulfillment of a contract to develop a temporal and spatial model for buried
cultural resources based on the Late Quaternary geologic history of the drainage basins
within the Reserve. The stratigraphy of numerous cutbank exposures and backhoe
trenches was recorded. Charcoal and bulk humate samples provided radiometric ages.
Buttermilk Creek drainage basin is smaller than the smallest basin recorded at Fort
Hood, therefore this summary focuses on the results regarding the small drainages.
Interpretations of climate and environment by Nordt (1992, 1995) are included here to
provide a regional overview.
Five alluvial units were identified within three terrace formations. The oldest
unit is the Jackson alluvium. This unit is composed of alternating channel and overbank
facies of equal proportions and is assigned a late Pleistocene age based on radiocarbon
results from bulk humates (15,230 B.P.). This represents the earliest age bracket for the

31

beginning of a major erosional event that scoured the valley to bedrock that occurred
between 15,000 and 11,000 B.P., followed by deposition of the Georgetown alluvium.
However, the Georgetown sediments and channel type do not reflect the power that such
a result would have required (Nordt 1992:62).
The following unit is the Georgetown alluvium, which comprised fine, wellsorted gravels overlain by massive yellow and gray loams to silty clay loams and is
measured 2-5 m thick in the upland basins of this study. The massive overbank
sediments exhibit a fining upward sequence to a truncated buried soil. This diagnostic
marker horizon has been termed the Royalty paleosol and is recognized as a Bk horizon
that caps the Georgetown unit. Bioturbation by plants and animals can be observed
throughout the solum. The Georgetown alluvial sediments in the small and intermediate
streams are fine-grained and mottled with gray and yellow, reflecting possible floodplain
marshes or wetlands. Charcoal from a hearth provides the youngest age of the Royalty
paleosol (8260 ±100 B.P. [GX15762]). This age is also considered the ending
timeframe for deposition of this alluvial unit and the beginning of an erosional event that
removed the A horizon (Nordt 1992). This is supported by a soil humate sample that
returned the age 9110 ± 100 [Beta-44297] (Nordt 1995).
The Fort Hood alluvium overlies the Georgetown alluvium. Charcoal samples
indicate deposition resumed after truncation of the Royalty paleosol and continued to
approximately 6800 B.P. In small basins, discrete cut and fills are observed where
gravel beds are overlain by thick, fine-grained strata containing diffuse gravels. The
surface soil is a yellowish brown, silty clay loam (A-Bk) with encrusted carbonate

32

filaments. Sediments of the Fort Hood alluvium indicate the channels of intermediate
and small streams adjusted by braiding in the early Holocene.
The West Range alluvium is the next youngest. It is subdivided into two
members that are defined by radiocarbon ages, sediment texture, and geomorphology.
The older, lower member is estimated to begin deposition at 4300 B.P., ending 2400
B.P. or possibly 1700 B.P. in some cases (based on bulk humate samples). Deposition
of the upper member began 2800 B.P. to 1700 B.P., and ended between 800 and 600
B.P. The West Range alluvium consists of sediments that are highly variable. While all
alluvial units are dependent upon stream setting, the West Range is reported to be even
more dependent than the other units identified in this study. In general, the sediment
load is coarser-grained when compared to the Fort Hood alluvium, evidence that
continued drying was taking place in the Holocene. Nordt (1992) suggests that this
drying resulted in continued channel entrenchment, where the finer-grained materials
were stripped previously and the underlying coarser sediments became the source of
alluvial parent material. In the lower member of small streams channel fills are shallow
and stacked, reflecting limited lateral channel migration. In the upper member, small
streams are generally finer-grained than the lower member. The upper member also
exhibits less vertical relief between channel and overbank facies. It is often buried by
the next youngest unit, the Ford alluvium. Surface soils of the West Range unit are
grayish brown loams exhibiting A-Bk and A-Bw profiles, with mycelial calcium
carbonate forms.

33

The youngest alluvial unit is the Ford alluvium, found on the modern alluvial
floodplain on the innermost meanders of streams. It comprises modern and partially
buried channel bars that are buried by overbank deposits. The uppermost strata have
been deposited in the last 50 years and are characterized as coarse-grained sediments, 30
cm thick. Changes in texture reflect wide fluctuations in flood magnitude. On small
streams this unit was found to truncate or onlap the West Range alluvial members.
Lithostratigraphic Correlations
Geoarchaeological investigations at Fort Hood (Nordt 1992, 1995) and
Buttermilk Creek downstream from the Gault site (Gibson 1997) support the relative
chronology of the stratigraphy recorded for the TAMU excavation block. Unit
correlations are summarized in Table 2.
Based on relative position and composition, units 1 (colluvial gravels), 2
(channel gravels), and 3a – 3b correspond with the Lankford alluvium of Buttermilk
Creek and the Jackson alluvium at Fort Hood. In each of these, basal gravels were
deposited on a scoured bedrock surface then overlain with overbank clay sediments.
Units 3a and 3b, the deposits bearing Clovis diagnostic artifacts, indicate the clays were
deposited prior to 11,000 B.P. Nordt (1992) reported an age of 15, 230 B.P. for the basal
gravels in the Jackson alluvium.

Units 4b and 4c are confidently correlated with the overbank facies of the Roden
alluvium of Buttermilk Creek and the Georgetown alluvium at Fort Hood on the basis of
composition, pedology and diagnostic artifacts. These units comprise are composed of
silty clay and clay, with inclusions of calcium carbonate nodules. A distinct buried soil,
the Brown paleosol (Gibson 1997) and the Royalty paleosol (Nordt 1992) serves as a
marker horizon; the upper portion is truncated leaving a Bk-Bk-BC solum. TAMU
excavations recovered Paleoindian Folsom and Angostura points from unit 4b, which
agrees with the radiocarbon ages obtained from bulk humates and charcoal samples by
Gibson (1997) and Nordt (1992, 1995) indicating deposition of this unit occurred
between 10,000 and 8,000 B.P.
Unit 5b is correlated with the overbank facies of the Solona alluvium (Buttermilk
Creek) and the Fort Hood alluvium based on relative position to the underlying units.

35

These units also contain report calcium carbonate filaments and nodules. Nordt (1995)
placed deposition of this unit between 7000 and 4800 B.P.
Unit 6b is correlated with the Lim / West Range alluvium based on relative
position and diagnostic points associated with the Archaic period that were recovered
from the Gault excavation. Gibson (1997) correlated the Lim alluvium with the West
Range lower member at Fort Hood, but indicated the West Range upper member
corresponds with a period of erosion in the Buttermilk Creek lithostratigraphy.
Deposition of the Lim and West Range lower member is estimated between 4000 and
2000 B.P.
Unit 7b is correlated with Eden – Adams units of Buttermilk Creek and the Ford
alluvium at Ford Hood based on position and diagnostic artifacts, although the history of
non-systematic excavations at the Gault site precludes assuming these deposits are
intact. Burned rock material associated with the Archaic, projectile points, and modern
materials can be found in this unit. Nordt (1992) estimates deposition of the Ford took
place from 1000 B.P. to present, while Gibson (1997) estimated deposition of the Eden
alluvium began around 2300 B.P, ending around 135 ±150 B.P (A-9563). Deposition of
the Adams alluvium has continued over the last 100 years.
Summary
The natural and cultural layers that form the stratigraphic record of the TAMU
excavation block provide information for reconstructing the last 15,000 years of
deposition. Organic materials were not preserved that could be used for radiometric

36

analyses. Previous research in the area supports the Gault relative chronology with
radiocarbon ages.
During the Late Pleistocene and prior to Clovis occupation, Buttermilk Creek
was a much larger force of energy which scoured the valley to the underlying bedrock
surface and subsequently deposited the channel gravels of unit 2. Evidence of a scour
with enormous energy is evident south of the excavation area, where more organic
sediment fills the void left when a boulder or tree was dislodged from its location in the
soft bedrock. The southern portion of the main excavation area is situated along the
valley margin, where colluvial gravel (unit 1) is interfingered with alluvial gravel (unit
2) and subsequent overbank units 3a and 3b.
The first evidence of a Clovis occupation was preserved on point bar / channel
facies and buried with clay sediments as Buttermilk Creek topped its southern bank. The
low-energy floodwater receded or evaporated and a period of stability ensued long
enough for a soil to develop on the surface of unit 3a. The sequence was repeated
resulting in the deposition of Clovis period artifacts and unit 3b. A period of erosion is
represented in the contact between unit 3b and the overlying unit 4b.
Units 4b and 4c are overbank sediments deposited during the Paleoindian and
early Archaic periods, beginning around 10,000 B.P. (Nordt 1992, 1995). Diagnostic
points associated with late Paleoindian periods (Folsom and Angostura) were recovered
from these units (Luchsinger 2002). The paleosol that caps unit 4c is a regional marker
horizon, the end of deposition reported by Nordt (1992) as 8260±100 (GX15762),
obtained from hearth charcoal. A second age for the paleosol is 9110±100 (Beta-44298),

37

obtained from soil humates (Nordt 1995). The truncated Bk-Bk-BC soil solum matches
regional observations that a significant erosional event took place at 8000 B.P. A large
pit excavated by pothunters from the surface into unit 4b was recorded in profile at the
excavation block.
Units 5b through 7b represent floodplain aggradation over the last 7,000 years,
from the early Archaic period to the present. Fragments from burned rock middens as
well as diagnostic Archaic points are present, though deposits are often disturbed, at the
Gault site (Collins 2002).

CHAPTER IV
GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF
NATURAL FORMATION PROCESSES

Archaeologists are now very much aware that the archaeological record –
cultural features and artifacts and their relationships – is part of a dynamic universe
where natural and cultural processes are at work changing the record’s original patterns
(Butzer 1982; Collins 1975; Hassan 1987; Isaac 1967; Shackley 1978; Shipman 1981;
Schiffer and Rathje 1973; Schiffer 1983, 1987; Wood and Johnson 1978). Close on the
heels of this ideology is the understanding that researchers must not assume a site’s
integrity, or artifact relationships, based on appearances. The list of potentially
transforming factors can seem endless but can become manageable by considering, on a
case by case basis, the variables that have the most applicability (Hassan 1985; Schiffer
1983). From stratigraphic investigations, researchers can identify the depositional
environment(s) and reconstruct the geomorphic landscape, as well as the climate,
vegetation, and fauna. The modern setting is also a factor to consider. As much as
humans are a component of an ecological system, the archaeological record continues as
a component of the natural environment, subject to its ongoing processes.
Stratigraphy at the TAMU excavation area places this portion of the Gault site on
the valley margin sandwiched between the Balcones Escarpment and the paleochannel of
Buttermilk Creek, near the creek's head. Underground springs maintain a perennial
stream while surface runoff increases stream discharge seasonally. The climate in

39

eastern central Texas is mild with wet and dry seasons. In clayey sediments, wet/dry
cycles are reflected with vertical cracking up to meters deep. Vegetation includes
grasses, shrubs, and trees, which also support a woodland faunal community. Potentially
disturbing natural agencies to consider at this location include stream action,
pedoturbation, and bioturbation. Colluvial processes are active at valley margins and
while the excavation area is positioned near the base of an escarpment, stratigraphy
indicates cultural materials are part of the alluvial units. Consequently, this study is
focused on identifying patterns that reflect the influence of hydrological, pedological,
and biological agents.
Natural Formation Processes Study
The principles of hydrology are used to evaluate archaeological site formation
and integrity in alluvial settings (Schiffer 1987; Waters 1992). Given enough strength,
current flow will orient elongate particles parallel or perpendicular to the directional
force (Johansson 1963; Isaac 1967; Kelling and Williams 1967; Rust 1972; Shackley
1978). Gravel and cobbles-sized particles that are closely packed in or near the channel
often become imbricated, with the vertical dips facing upstream. In an experimental
study, Schick (1987) found that, given the right amount of energy to entrain particles,
fluvial action will disperse smaller materials and reorganize them in a splay pattern
slightly downstream from the original site location. Other signs of fluvial action include
abraded edges on particles and absence of smaller sized particles such as microdebitage.
Using multiple lines of evidence, Dibble et al. (1997) concluded artifacts
recorded at a Lower Paleolithic site in France were significantly dispersed by stream

40

action. Artifacts showed a preferred orientation parallel to stream flow with a secondary
preferred direction that followed the slope of the terrace. Patterned dip measurements
indicated artifacts and surrounding matrix were imbricated. Noncultural artifact edge
damage, matching weight distribution with nonartifactual material, and lack of
microdebitage proportional to the overall assemblage provided additional support for
this conclusion (Dibble et al. 2007:638). At the Mill Iron site in Montana, Ingbar and
Larson (1992) used orientation analysis to determine that although postdepositional
processes slightly tilted and aligned artifacts parallel to the slope, the spatial patterns
were not significantly modified from the original positions.
Orientation analyses provide insight to spatial relationships on a predominantly
horizontal plane. An effective way to examine the vertical spatial relationships is with a
study of refitting artifacts (Hofman 1981; Villa 1982). Although time-consuming, the
effort is worth the expenditure because the results of refitting artifacts can be examined
on several levels, such as manufacturing techniques, artifact life-history, and intra /
intersite relationships (Cahen et al. 1979; Cziesla et al. 1990; Hofman and Enloe 1992;
Odell 2000). Artifact pieces that have been reassembled fall into three categories:
portions of one, broken during its use-life or post-depositionally; artifacts that can be
rejoined sequential relative to the manufacture process; and artifacts that are confidently
matched from the same nodule but not exact physical matches (Ingbar and Larson 1992;
Odell 2000). The foundation of refitting is that something that was once a whole, such
as a ceramic pot or chipped stone flake, represents an event in time. Thus, the first
category of refits can tie discrete spatial units in time. The second category

41

accomplishes this as well, keeping in mind that sequential pieces may also be the result
of recycling (Schiffer 1983). The third category is best used with the support of
additional analyses to lend weight to any conclusions that are drawn regarding spatial
associations. However, insight can be gained with regard to behavioral activities when
“ghosts” and “orphans” are identified (Odell 2000).
Cahen and Moeyersons (1977) applied refit analysis to detect postdepositional
movement in massive sand deposits at the Acheulian site, Gombe Point, in central
Africa. Refitting groups were identified between artifact concentrations at different
radiocarbon-dated depths and out of reduction sequence, negating the possibility that
materials had been recycled by more recent occupations. This significant study required
researchers to reclassify stone tool technology for this period and region. Hofman
(1986; 1992b) applied a study of refitting chipped stone artifacts to identify an
occupational surface at the Cave Spring site, recorded in alluvial deposits of the Duck
River in Tennessee. Refitted artifacts showed post-depositional movement up to 40 cm,
despite clear stratigraphy. The Cave Spring assemblage was interpreted as belonging to
one occupation level instead of a multi-level site and the refit study was critical to
making this interpretation. The spatial patterns of artifacts recovered from the Gault
TAMU excavation block may have been influenced by stream action or postdepositional processes. The following section reports the artifact orientation analysis
and refit study aimed toward evaluating the context of the assemblage recorded in the
Clovis clays.

42

Artifact Orientation Analysis
Methods
Artifacts recovered from the Gault site TAMU excavation were examined as
sedimentary particles with two purposes in mind: to gain further insight for
reconstructing the depositional environment that led to the accumulation and subsequent
burial of the assemblage, and to evaluate the degree of disturbance that may have
occurred once the artifacts became part of the archaeological record. As excavations
progressed through the cultural deposits bearing Paleoindian artifacts, excavators
referenced local datum to record the horizontal and vertical positions of artifacts with
one length larger than 2.5 cm. At the end of a 5 cm excavation level, and at sublevels
when artifact density required, a compass was used to record the direction of an in situ
artifact’s long axis relative to magnetic north. (Every effort was made not to dislodge
materials; in the event that an artifact was possibly out of situ, orientation data was not
collected.) The degree of dip for the upward face was then recorded using the compass
clinometer, followed by the face direction relative to magnetic north. (Note that dip
measurement was not always measured perpendicular to the long axis due to the
occasions when the direction of the dipped face coincided with the long axis.) The
three-dimensional coordinate data were correlated to the geologic units identified in the
stratigraphic analysis. Records that could not be confidently placed in a geologic level
were excluded from this study.
Rose diagrams were created (Rose 2.0.4, Thompson 2003) using data that was
compiled for each geologic unit 3a and 3b. Additional rose diagrams were then created

43

to look for smaller-scaled patterns within each geologic unit by combining the 23
excavation units (each 1 m2 into five contiguous groups, to prevent small-scale patterns
of long axes orientation from being obscured yet maintain sufficient number of
observations (Davis 2004). Rose diagrams are unidirectional to simplify visual
inspection. Because the data is planar, descriptive statistics are reported for bidirectional
circular data (personal communication, T. Thompson 2005). Direction and degree of dip
information was graphed with histograms and scatter plots and variation statistically
analyzed using non-parametric tests (SPSS 7.5).
Results
Long Axis Orientations (Strike)
Table 3 lists the descriptive statistics for long axis orientations recorded in units
3a and 3b. Preferred orientation was not identified statistically and mean resultant
length/consistency ratio closer to zero than one indicates wide dispersion of vectors.
Angle deviations average 80 degrees, also indicative that vectors are not clustered.
Visual inspection of long axis data found all directions were well represented in both
geologic units, with a potential but very slight preferred orientation discernable toward
the north/northeast (see Figure 5). When the compiled data is broken into smaller
groups of excavation units, this minor preferred orientation is observed only in the
central-northern groups of Unit 3b and then in the northern group of Unit 3a. This
pattern does not extend into the northernmost excavation unit group (see Figure 6).

Artifact Inclination (Dip) - Variation between the Geologic Units
Dipped artifacts did not differ significantly in their distribution among the
cardinal directions when strata were compared ( 2 = 6.88, p = 0.0758). A significant

difference was observed for the angle of inclined artifacts (t (940) = -2.006, p = 0.045;
Man-Whitney Z = -2.274, p = 0.0230), with Unit 3b having a higher mean degree of dip
than 3a, however the difference is small (Unit 3b = 30, Unit 3a = 28; see Figure 7).

Artifact Inclination (Dip) - Variation within Geologic Units
Dipped artifacts also did not show a significant difference in their distribution
among cardinal directions when each stratum was compared to a theoretical distribution
(Unit 3b

= 4.27, p = 0.2390; Unit 3a

2

= 5.79, p = 0.1224). The mean degree of dip

for the cardinal directions did not differ significantly within unit 3b (Kruskal Wallace

2

(3) = 0.964, p = 0.810), but a significant difference was found in unit 3a where artifacts
inclined to the north and east had a higher mean degree of dip than those inclined to the
south and west (Kruskal Wallace

2

(3) = 9.319, p = 0.025; see Table 4).

There does not appear to be a horizontal or vertical distribution pattern for
direction of dip beyond distribution to correspond with the extents of the geologic unit
deposits. Scatterplots were calculated using northing and easting as x and y axes,
respectively, and show artifacts dipped in all cardinal directions throughout the geologic
units under study. Figure 8 shows artifact direction/degree of dip for unit 3b, distributed
across the deposit with no apparent relationship between northing and easting, or
northing and elevation (see Figure 9). Artifacts are also randomly dipped on the
horizontal plane of Geologic unit 3a, although distribution of artifacts shows an easterly
channel extending through N1017.5 / N 1018.00, E 982 to 986 (see Figure 10), with a
maximum depth of 15 centimeters (see Figure 11).

Conclusions
Orientation data reflects a relatively high degree of contextual integrity, with a
slight preference for the general paleotopography recorded in the stratigraphy. Circular
statistics did not find preferred orientation. Visual inspection of long axis orientations
shows artifacts oriented to all directions, with possible preferred orientation toward
north-northeast in central and north-central groups of 3b, north central group of 3a.
When direction and degree of dip information was compared between strata, unit
3b was found to have a higher mean degree of dip by 2 degrees (30 vs. 28 degrees) and
no significant difference found in distribution of cardinal directions. No significant
difference found when direction of dip information was compared to a theoretical
distribution for each stratum.
Artifacts inclined to the north and the east in unit 3a were found to have a higher
mean degree of dip than those inclined to the south and west. Visual inspection of
scatterplots indicates northing and easting were not found to predict degree or direction
of dip in either unit, with the possible exception of unit 3b artifacts steeply dipped to the
west, clustered in north-central excavation area.
Horizontal and vertical distribution of dipped artifacts appears to follow
stratigraphy. Artifacts with that were horizontally level in unit 3a are not recorded
below elevation 95.00, the elevations where the channel appears to have been filled.
Artifacts in unit 3b have distribution that is homogenous in thickness, with level upper
and lower boundaries. Artifacts in unit 3a reflect distribution that indicates a break in

53

the horizontal surface in the south-central area, maximum 15 cm depth and
approximately 1 m wide, trending east-west.
Artifact Refitting Study
Methods
The study comprised three sample sets examined at separate times: (1) pointplotted artifacts from geological units 3a and 3b (“Clovis Clays”), not including bifaces,
blades, overshot flakes, core tablet flakes, or large flakes, (2) blades from the geologic
units 3b and 3a, and (3) the same artifact types as in set (1) but reduced horizontal extent
of a 2 x 2 m block (4 units) and expanded vertically (excavation levels through geologic
unit 4c), this last set designed for to increase the probability of identifying refit groups
based on the basis of high artifact counts in the 3a and 3b levels. Stackelbeck (2000)
and Hofman (1981) report success with refit investigations undertaken after the artifacts
have been analyzed according to attributes. Although this study was completed at the
same time as technical analyses, refits were identified during analyses by other
researchers and are included gratefully in this report.
Labeled artifacts recovered from the Clovis clay deposits were organized by
excavation unit and level and placed in shallow, divided boxes on a large table. Refit
study participants looked for matches first within a unit and level, then expanded the
search to horizontally and vertically adjacent units, and then searched non-adjacent units.
Nearly 100 percent of the chipped stone assemblage consisted of a single material,
Edwards chert. To facilitate identifying a match, artifacts were often grouped by
attributes related to technical classification (core, cortical/noncortical flake, blade) and

54

physical characteristics such as color patterns, cortex features, unique banding, and
macro-inclusions. Minimum analytical nodules (Odell 2000) were not considered at the
time the study was designed and are beyond the scope of this research.
Artifacts with point provenience information are reported with those values, to
the nearest millimeter. Artifacts recovered from the screen were assigned average
provenience measurements according to excavation unit and level (center of 1 x 1 m unit
and elevation midpoint for each 5 cm level). Where more than one artifact is in a group,
the greatest vertical and horizontal distance values were used in tabulations.
Excavation levels were translated to geological units post-excavation by Dr. M.
Waters. The 3a/3b designation as a transition zone became necessary because a clear
contact could not be discerned in certain sections of the profile walls during the
fieldwork. Micromorphological investigations identified evidence of a soil between
units 3a and 3b that has been obscured through the activity of microorganisms
(Luchsinger 2002). In addition to identifying contemporaneous artifact movement
between geologic units, refit groups with an element in this unit may indicate continuity
of occupation(s).
Approximately 170 hours was devoted to examining the sample sets, finding the
first 24 groups. Additional refits were identified during separate technical analyses.
Scott Minchak provided technical descriptions for blades; Charlotte Pevny and William
Dickens provided technical attribute information for all other aspects of the assemblage.

55

Results
Thirty-three groups consisting of refitting pieces (n=73) were identified for use in
this study, representing a fraction (0.1 percent) of the total assemblage from the geologic
units 3a and 3b (n = 66,000; Pevny and Carlson 2008). A complete inventory of refits
groups is provided in Appendix A. Two groups (22, 23) were excluded due to equivocal
contact surfaces; two other groups (N1, N2) were excluded because the breaks occurred
during excavation; a fifth group (36) was excluded because the pieces are an unmodified river cobble recovered from unit 2. All other refit groups that were identified
were recovered from the Clovis-bearing clay deposits, geological units 3a and 3b.
Figure 12 shows the 33 refit group distribution between units 3a and 3b.

Figure 12. Refit group distribution between units 3a and 3b.

Twenty-two refit groups (67 percent) had a vertical difference of 5 cm or less
between pieces. The maximum vertical difference measured 20 cm (group 28); mean

56

difference equaled 6 cm, and the mode value was zero (no measurable vertical
difference). Of the 33 refit groups used for tabulations, 19 consist of fragments that refit
and 15 were sequential refits. A summary of refit groups is provided in Table 5.
Since one of the sample sets examined for refits focused on a 4 x 4 m area where
artifacts were recorded in high concentrations, the horizontal distribution of refitting
pieces is biased to a certain degree in favor of this central area of the excavation block.
Few refit groups were identified during this portion of the study however, therefore the
bias is considered small. Of the 33 groups, 91 percent of the refitting pieces are located
within 2 m of each other. The majority of refitting pieces recovered from unit 3a are
confined between the north 1017 and 1020 lines (see Figure 13), extending east and west
the length of the lithostratigraphic unit. The maximum horizontal distance measured 2.8
m (refit group 31), although the vertical difference measured zero. The two refit groups
recovered from unit 3b are tightly situated (all four artifacts were point-provenienced
with no measurable horizontal distance) within one excavation unit, toward the north end
of the excavation block (see Figure 14). Refit groups with artifacts that appear to cross
units 3a and 3b are depicted in Figure 15. Refit groups with artifacts recovered from
levels where the boundary between unit 3a and 3b was not definitive (termed 3a/3b) are
shown in Figure 16; the distributions in these cases appear to reflect their better-defined
counterparts, although with few groups in unit 3b suggested correlations must remain
tenuous.

The following section reports characteristics of refit groups that cross geologic
units, register high vertical separation or horizontal separations, or offer unique
characteristics for within geological unit observations.
Refit Groups That Cross Geological Units
Five groups were identified that appear to have elements from both of these
units. Four of these are fragment-style refits, and one is a sequential refit. Vertical
distances range from 20 cm to 12.5 cm, among the highest values of all the groups.
These groups also have higher horizontal differences, although horizontally distant refits
with little to no vertical distance were also identified.
Group 28 comprises the medial and proximal portions of a non-cortical blade
(Minchak 2007) recorded at the highest vertical difference (20 cm) and relatively high
horizontal difference (2 m), although both of these artifacts were recovered from the
screen and therefore positions are known to the nearest meter horizontally and within 5
centimeters vertically. Excavation unit records indicate the artifact currently designated
from 3b, may in fact have some portion of unit 3a intruding.
Group 27 consists of the medial and proximal portions of a stage II biface that
appears to have snapped during end thinning. They were recovered from adjacent units
with a vertical difference of 15 cm and horizontal separation approximately 1.75 m. It is
possible that a sliver of 3a intrudes into the overlaying 3b.
Refit group 25, comprises two stage III biface fragments, one of which retains
some cortex (see Figure 17). These were not recovered from contiguous units, and
registered vertical difference of 18 cm and horizontal difference of 2.7 m. Looting had

62

occurred in the area west of the N1020 / E983 unit and is one cause to consider for
displacement.

Figure 17. Refit group 25.

63

Group 24 is a sequential refit of two cortical flakes. One is an overshot flake
with evidence of being heated (AM 182-B; recovered from unit 3b; see Figure 18b) that
refits to a large cortical flake with no evidence of heating (AM-H3; recovered from unit
3a; see Figure 18a). The horizontal distance between artifacts measured 1.5 m and the
vertical difference measured 11 cm.

64

Figure 19 shows refit group 21, which consists of the medial and distal portions
of a thin, non-cortical flake. The horizontal difference measured only 25 cm, while the
vertical separation was 12.5 cm.

Figure 19. Refit group 21.

Selected Refit Groups from Unit 3a
Figure 20 shows Group 13, the proximal and distal portions that form a complete
fluted perform (Stage VI). Both were recovered from geological unit 3a, although the
vertical difference in elevation was 15 cm and horizontal distance between them
measured 1.75 m. Both pieces have one side stained darker the other.
Group 26 consists of two stage III biface fragments that were recovered from unit
3a, with a 9 cm difference in elevation. The horizontal difference measured nearly a

65

meter (0.9 m), notable because one of the fragments was burned after the biface was
broken (see Figure 21).

Figure 20. Refit group 13.

66

Figure 21. Refit group 26.

Group 5 comprises 4 sequential fits recovered from unit 3a (see Figure 22). The
four pieces consist of a small core and three flakes. The core and first 2 sequential
flakes were recovered from the same excavation unit and level. The last flake in the
sequence registered the maximum distance from the core (1.0 m).

67

Figure 22. Refit group 5.

Refit group 29 is notable for its apparent difference in material – a darker gray
chert that may be associated with material described from Fort Hood (C. Pevny, personal
communication 2006). The sequential pieces consist of a complete flake, possibly edge
modified, from the central area of the artifact concentration (excavation unit N1017
E983) rejoined with the distal portion of a cortical blade recorded approximately 2.0 m
distant, at the northern extent of the concentration area.

68

Group 15 is shown in Figure 23. It consists of a whole flake that rejoins with
two fragments of shatter, it is categorized as a sequential refit based on the fact that the
piece broke apart during the reduction process. The maximum vertical difference
between any of the pieces measured 0.5 cm, however the horizontal distance measured
1.6 m.

69

Refit Groups from Geological Unit 3a and Transition 3a/3b
Figure 24 shows refit group 3 that contains 4 artifacts, four complete flakes that
sequential fit to a small core. Notably, it is the first flake in sequence that was recovered
from the higher elevation and geologic unit 3a/3b, albeit from screen and not pointprovenienced. Three of the pieces were recovered from the same excavation unit: the
core and second sequential flake from the same 5 cm excavation level; the third flake
was also recovered from the screen but from the excavation unit adjacent and to the
north. Maximum distances are estimated to be 5 cm vertical and 1 m horizontal.
Group 12 (see Figure 25) is a sequential refit of two large cortical flakes
categorized as core clean-up flakes (Dickens 2005). The maximum vertical distance
measured 4 cm and the horizontal distance measured 1.6 m.
Group 32 consists of two fragments that refit to form a non-cortical stage IV
biface that snapped during end-thinning (see Figure 26). The difference in vertical
elevation measured 2 cm, while the horizontal difference measured 2.25 m.

Refit Groups from Geological Unit 3b and Transition 3a/3b
Refit group 10 was the only group identified with elements in unit 3b and the
transitional unit. It is a combination of three elements representing both categories of fit.
The distal and proximal fragments of a cortical flake sequentially join with a complete
cortical flake (see Figure 27). One fragment (AM 247.G) was recovered from unit 3b;
while its proximal partner and the whole flake were recovered from the same excavation
unit and level assigned to the transitional unit 3a/3b. The maximum horizontal distance
measured 1.12 m; maximum vertical separation measured 5.5 cm.

Conclusions
The refit study indicates that the archaeological record of units 3a and 3b, the
Clovis clays, retained a high degree of contextual integrity. All refit groups were
contained within the Clovis cultural levels. One other group was a geofact whose two
fragments were recovered from the underlying channel deposit, unit 2.
Within the Clovis-age deposits, the maximum vertical distance between refitting
artifacts measured 20 cm. Instances of vertical displacement are represented by 5 of 28
refit groups that appear to cross units 3a and 3b (17 percent). The 5 groups with
elements recovered from the transitional unit 3a/3b, where a clear contact between the
units could not be discerned, are potentially groups that cross units. However, since the
location of these refit groups is equivocal, they were excluded from these tabulations.
The artifacts contained in the groups crossing units 3a and 3b are variable in type, size,
and weight. No apparent trends such as smaller-refit artifacts moving upward,
downward, or laterally, were discerned that would indicate significant depositional or
post-depositional displacement has occurred as the result of stream action, trampling, or
burrowing animals. If Clovis people were walking over this surface or reusing materials,
some dislocation of refitting artifacts would be expected.
High values of horizontal distance were observed in all of the groups crossing
units 3a and 3b. However, this cannot be considered a dependent variable due to
observations with equally high horizontal distances but small or zero vertical distances.
With the exception of group 13, vertical distances within unit 3a measured less than 7
cm.

75

The majority of refit groups (n = 21; 64 percent) were recovered from unit 3a,
and 4 of the 5 with elements in the transition zone have one or more element in 3a. Only
two refit groups were identified in unit 3b and one group with elements in 3b and 3a/3b.
Compared to the number of refits identified from 3a, the refit data lends support to the
scenario where occupation activity decreased during the formation unit 3b.
Horizontal patterning was not the primary focus of this study but was examined
for general trends. Initial indications of point-provenienced artifacts did not identify
clear, horizontally discrete concentrations of refit groups within unit 3a. Larger values
of horizontal separation are present in the units north of the 1018 line. The small
number of refit groups identified from unit 3b limits conclusions to a very general level.
The artifacts in these groups have small values of vertical and horizontal separation,
indicating little displacement has occurred.
Finally, a variety of chipped stone artifact types are represented in the refit
groups. The numbers of sequential refits compared with the fragments that conjoin are
relatively equal (15 versus 18, respectively). Of the sequential refits, 4 groups consist of
a core and flakes, 3 groups are overshot flakes, 1 group consists of refitting blades, and 7
groups comprise general flakes as one element of the group. Of the fragmented artifacts
that conjoin, 6 are bifaces, 4 are overshot flakes, 2 are blades, and 6 are general flakes.
The variable nature of refitting pieces and the limited number of pieces within refit
groups supports a scenario where not just quarrying but also more generalized activities
were taking place at this site.

CHAPTER V
SUMMARY

This geoarchaeological research provides essential information for understanding
the natural and cultural layers that were the TAMU excavation block at the Gault site.
The stratigraphic investigation provides the temporal and spatial framework in which the
cultural materials can be organized. Clear stratigraphy does not allow us to assume the
artifact and assemblage associations however. Artifact spatial analyses examined long
axis orientations and artifact degree of dip to identify non-random patterns that would
result from stream action. Vertical and horizontal relationships of refitting artifacts were
examined to evaluate post-depositional displacement. The results of this research
indicate the clays bearing Clovis materials retained a high degree of integrity such that
the spatial patterns preserved in the archaeological record at this location are the result of
cultural activities and not natural processes.
The stratigraphic record preserved a sequence of seven lithostratigraphic units
deposited by the perennial Buttermilk Creek. These units comprised channel and point
bar facies, overlain by finer-grained overbank sediments over the course of the last
11,000 calendar years, based on the oldest cultural materials recovered from the
excavation block – fluted points, blades, and overshot flakes diagnostic of the Clovis
period (Waters and Stafford 2007). Located at the margin of the stream valley, colluvial
materials interfinger with the alluvial units. A distinct buried soil was identified capping
the alluvium bearing more recent Paleoindian Folsom and Angostura points, which

77

serves as a marker horizon that is regionally correlated to the Brown (Gibson 1997) and
Royalty (Nordt 1992, 1995) paleosol. Luchsinger (2002) confirmed in
micromorphological analysis that the contact between 3a and 3b is a second buried soil
that is less distinct in appearance, having been obscured by microbiological activity.
The unconformable contact between units 3b and 4b represents a period of erosion in
which we don’t know the amount of material that may have been removed when 3b was
truncated. Artifact orientation analyses were completed to identify the influence of
stream action on artifact spatial patterns.
The orientation analyses did not find non-random spatial patterns in long-axis
orientations (strike) or artifact degree of inclination (dip). Minor preferred orientations
and trends in dip followed the site-specific paleotopography represented in the
stratigraphy. Artifacts in unit 3b showed a significant difference in degree of dip when
compared to the artifacts in unit 3a, although the difference was small (30 versus 28
degrees). A small easterly channel is represented by vertical distribution of dipped
artifacts in the southern area of the excavation block (N1017, E982-986). The dip values
are random, however, not imbricated.
A study of refitting artifacts was completed to evaluate post-depositional vertical
displacement and look for horizontally discrete concentrations. Thirty-three groups of
refitting artifacts were identified for use in the tabulations. With approximately 66,000
artifacts in the unit 3a and 3b assemblage, the refits are a mere fraction (0.1 percent).
Sequential and fragmented refit types were found in nearly equal numbers. Artifact
types varied from bifaces (including a Stage VI fluted preform), overshot flakes, blades,

78

flakes, and cores. Only two groups were recovered unequivocally from unit 3b, while
the majority of refit groups are associated with unit 3a. Of 28 refit groups unequivocally
associated with unit 3 and 3b, 5 contain elements that appear to come from both units 3a
and 3b. The maximum vertical distance between refits measured 20 cm, although 67
percent of the thirty-three groups measured a maximum vertical separation of 6 cm or
less. Few refits were recovered from unit 3b, preventing any conclusive results of
horizontal spatial patterns beyond the fact that these refitting pieces are less horizontally
distant than refit artifacts in unit 3a. Refitting artifacts in unit 3a were found up to 2.8 m
distant. The artifacts from this refit group measured zero vertical distance however, thus
horizontal distance is not necessarily correlated with vertical distance.
Geoarchaeological studies such as these provide important information that is
necessary for archaeologists to develop accurate and comprehensive interpretations of
the archaeological record. The geomorphic landscape and associated depositional
environments of a site are derived from traditional stratigraphic investigations, and serve
to broaden our understanding of cultural behaviors as they relate to their environmental
context. Though time-consuming in the field and laboratory, additional fine-grained
analyses such as the artifact orientation and refit studies reported here provide separate
lines of evidence to account for natural processes that may have acted to obscure the
original patterns of the archaeological record, and our understanding of past human
cultures.
