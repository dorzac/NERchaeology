ABSTRACT
In July 2005 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resource management survey of two proposed wetland restoration marshes in Montague
County, Texas. The proposed project areas consisted of Site 1 roughly3.56 ha. (8.80ac)
and Site 2 roughly 5.33 ha (13.17 ac). Visual examination and shovel testing found no
historic or prehistoric cultural resources within the project boundaries but did find a
reinforced cement cattle pond and artesian well on Site 1. No artifacts were found in
shovel testing or inspection of non-vegetated ground surfaces. No further investigations
are recommended. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no
effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project areas.

INTRODUCTION
On 18 July 2005 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of two proposed wetland habitat restoration areas
on the Owen property in Montague County, Texas for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS).

The survey was conducted under Section 106 of the National Historic

Preservation Act. The report was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.

Based

on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to cultural resources
for the proposed wetland areas.

The proposed project focused on wetland habitat restoration by constructing two low
berms to induce ponding in the Middle and West Belkamp Creeks northwest of
Stoneburg, Texas. The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any
cultural resources within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following
the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a)
with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included approximately 8.89 hectares (21.97 acres) in two ponds (Site 1 and
Site 2) on the Owen property approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) northwest of
Stoneburge, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed pond areas were in fallow pastures. On Site
1 vegetation was predominantly immature and mature hardwood trees with interspersed
grassy areas and bushes. Site 2 was more open with isolated trees or small clusters of
trees in an area dominated by various grasses and shrubs. The property owner planned to
bulldoze shallow areas to create two berms to hold water approximately one meter (3
feet) deep in the existing floodplains and plant water tolerant grasses in the inundated
area.s. Site 1 was bound by a ridge and a gravel road to the south. Site 2 was bound by a
ridge to the west.

The area was topographically bound by natural slopes to the south,

east, and west. The stream joins with a larger intermittent drainage at the northern end of
the property. The berm locations were depicted on a topographic map from the USFWS
and the landowner at the time of the survey. Berm locations were documented with a
GPS receiver at the time of the cultural resources survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Montague County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. A majority of these investigations focused on
smaller areas and farm to market roads by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) and on rural development throughout the county by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). The closest survey was an assessment of a county road by
TDHPT in 1979 beginning in Stoneburg following a county road west and south. No
archaeological sites were recorded during the survey. The next closest surveys were over 7
km (4 miles) to the east and south.

Montague County is in the Plains Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Pettula 1993). This
region included populations ranging from the Paleo-Indian (prior to 6000 B.C.) through the
Archaic (6000 B.C. – 700 B.C.), Late Prehistoric (700 B.C – A.D. 1700), and Historic
(A.D. 1700 – present). These stages were based on changes in environment, technology,
and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.

The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) was the earliest generally accepted cultural
period in the New World and included populations that inhabited North America from the
Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene.

Paleo-Indians were thought to have been

organized into small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of
plants and animals (Story 1990). Paleo-Indian artifacts found in the region include Clovis,
Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Folsom. Toward the end of the Paleo-Indian period, point
styles gradually changed to more stemmed and barbed varieties.

The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment but retained a hunting-gathering
subsistence (Story 1990). The Archaic was further divided into Early, Middle, and Late
divisions (Prikryl 1990).

Early Archaic included Angostura, Bower, Martindale, and

Uvalde. Middle Archaic costal phases are expressed by Carlton, Morrill, Wells, Calf
Creek, Bell, and Andice. The Late Archaic understanding of the region includes a dramatic
increase in population and local materials were exploited (McGregor 1987).

3

The Late Prehistoric in the region showed the gradual adaptation of the bow and arrow,
horticulture/agriculture, and the spread of ceramics within the Comanche and Wichita
cultures. Projectile points were predominantly Scallorn, Alba, Steiner, and Catahoula
arrow points and later, Washita, Harrell, and Fresno points suggested an emphasis on
buffalo hunting (Prykryl 1990).
Historic occupation began with the exploration of the area by the Spanish during the 16th
and 17th centuries. However, settlement in the area did not begin in earnest until American
expansion in the 1850’s. In 1858 Montague county was extracted from adjacent Cooke
County with less than 1000 non-military inhabitants.

Cattle ranching dominated the

economy. The population slowly grew as railroad towns began along new spur from Ft.
Worth by the end of the 19th century. This changed as cotton dominated the market in the
early 20th century. By the mid 20th century farming turned to apples, tomatoes, potatoes,
and watermelons. Today, Montague County has a diverse economy with the addition of
manufacturing plants to the strong agricultural tradition (Webb 1952).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.

The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using maps
and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2005). The site location maps and cultural resources
records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within
or in close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas was consulted for published and
unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.

DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the areas. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination. Shovel testing included
excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels
down 30 cm (12 inches) to the clay substrate. The excavated matrix was sifted thru a
0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen for artifacts. The depth, soil type, and soil color
of each shovel test were recorded. Shovel test locations focused on investigating the
areas impacted by the marsh. Visual examination of the exposed subsurface was a

5

continuous effort between shovel tests. The inventory was conducted in accordance with
the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys. According to
these guidelines, project areas between 1.2 and 4 hectares (3 and 10 acres) require a
minimum of two shovel test per 0.4 ha (1 acre) and areas between 4.4 and 40.5 hectares
(11 and 100 acres) require a minimum of one test per every 0.8 ha. (2 acres).

RESULTS
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2005) has no previously recorded sites within
one mile of the project area. The closest documented archaeological site is roughly 5 km (3
miles) southeast of the project area.

The Owen marshes will be constructed by blocking natural slope drainages in wide
floodplains. Soils in both areas were described as Gown loam, occasionally flooded
(NRCS 1978). The property owner plans to create two dams approximately one meter (3
feet) high by bulldozing the floodplain soil to create the dams. The remainder of the
pond areas will be cleared of trees and water tolerant grasses will be planted. Shovel
testing instead of trenching was used because of the limited subsurface disturbance in an
isolated area. According to the NRCS soil description, Gowen loam is roughly 60 cm (24
inches) of dark grayish brown loam over brown clay loam. Areas that flood frequently
have a lighter color brown sandy loam up to 50 cm thick over the loam horizon.

Site 1
Site 1 covers a 500 x 75 m (1640 x 246 ft) area; roughly 3.56 ha. (8.80ac) (Figure 2, Site
1). Vegetation was predominantly immature and mature hardwood trees with interspersed
grassy areas and bushes. Grassy areas often had between 30 and 40 percent ground cover
leaving exposed surface areas between clumps or individual plants.

The area is

topographically limited to a gradual but continuous slope from the adjacent ridge to the
south toward the Middle Belkamp Creek. The Middle Belcamp Creek channel was dry at
the time of the survey with interspaced puddles in the channel. At the time of the survey
the landowner’s description of the project area and the depiction on the map did not match.
The landowner described the berm’s eastern limit on the east side of the creek channel and
extending westward. The map depicts the eastern end of the berm west of the channel.
Both gave the berm length of roughly 500 m (1700 ft). Shovel tests were excavated from
the east side of the channel to the western most limit depicted on the map to insure the
marsh area would be covered adequately. The survey area covered an area roughly 600 m
(1970 ft) long. The total area surveyed was approximately 4.5 ha. (11.1 acres).

The area immediately along the channel included lighter color brown sandy loam while
areas further from the channel were typical of the Gowen soil profile. Shovel tests
penetrated the sandy layer and went into the loamy clay. A total of 14 shovel tests were
excavated in the area. Results are depicted in Table 1.

Table 1. Site 1 shovel test data.
No artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort nor were any observed in the surface
inspection. The only cultural features in the project area included a cattle pond at the
western extent of the proposed marsh and a rectangular well. The pond was an area
excavated with the displaced matrix piled down hill from the excavation. The well was a
artesian structure (no pump required) with a rectangular pond made of reinforced cement
roughly 3 meters square (10 ft square) and 30 cm (12 inches) deep. Water was flowing at
the time of the survey. The use of reinforced cement became common place in the early to
mid 20th century. No other structures or artifact scatters were found in association with the
well and pond in shovel test or along the road. DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to significant cultural resources for Site 1.

Site 2
Site 2 covers a triangular area roughly (410 x 260) m (1345 x 853 ft) encompassing an area
of 5.33 ha (13.17 ac.). Vegetation was open with isolated trees or small clusters of trees in
an area dominated by various grasses and shrubs. The pedestrian survey found that much
of the area to be flooded was relatively level. The project area was bound on the west by a
low ridge and to the east by West Belkamp Creek. An intermittent drainage from a stock
pond runs along the base of the ridge to the west.

Shovel testing in the project are focused on the berm area adjacent to the slope to the west
and the embankment along the creek channel. Shovel testing found isolated areas with
brown sandy loam over loamy clay and other areas with the typical Gowen soil profile. A
total of 21 shovel tests were excavated in the area. Results are depicted in Table 1.

No artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort nor were any observed in the surface
inspection. Because of the lack of artifacts and loamy and clayey soils, DETAC requests
concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to significant cultural resources for Site 2.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed wetland habitat restoration project areas will utilize portions of the West
and Middle Belkamp Creek floodplains to create wetland habitats. The property owner
will create two marshes by bulldozing the area near the proposed berm and piling the
matrix. Some tree clearing will be necessary thought the marsh areas. The investigations
relied on shovel testing with limited surface inspection. Site 1 contained an artesian well
with a reinforced cement pond but no other cultural features or artifact clusters. The size
and shape of the pond suggests it was made for cattle during dry times of the year. Site 2
had no artifacts or cultural features.

Several negative shovel tests in both areas and surface inspection found no cultural
modified material. Based on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering
cultural resources in the project areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the
determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project areas.
