ABSTRACT
XIT Rural Telephone Cooperative, Inc (XIT Telephone) is proposing to
install approximately 80 miles of fiber optic line in Dallam, Hartley, and
Oldham counties in the northwest section of the Texas Panhandle. XIT
Telephone contracted with N-Com, Inc., for designs and environmental
permitting. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted to conduct the
windshield and pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed route and
to determine if any cultural resources were present, and to make
recommendations about their significance. ARC conducted the survey in
May of 2011. This survey work included evaluating all 80 miles of the
routes, walking 30 miles considered areas of high potential for cultural
resources (HPAs). Three prehistoric (41HT63, 64, and 65) and two
historic archaeological sites (41HT66 and 41DA46) were identified.
41HT63 is a lithic scatter at the top of a cliff overlooking Rita Blanca
Creek. Sites 41HT64 and 65 were small prehistoric lithic quarry sites with
no diagnostic artifacts. 41HT66 is a deteriorating historic culvert. 41DA46
is a retaining wall or possible bridge footing dating to 1937 and potentially
constructed by the WPA. 41HT64 and 41HT65 are not recommended for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Given that the
boundaries of 41HT63 extend beyond the right of way (ROW) and have
not been fully identified, its eligibility for listing on the NRHP is still
undetermined. Both 41DA46 and 41HT66 are located outside of the
ROW, so no determinations of legibility have been made for either of the
historic sites. Based on the results of the survey, ARC recommends that
the project should be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
XIT Rural Telephone Cooperative, Inc (XIT Telephone) is proposing to install
approximately 80 miles of fiber optic line in Dallam, Hartley, and Oldham counties in the
northwest section of the Texas Panhandle as part of their Broadband Stimulus Round 2
project (Figure 1). XIT Telephone will be receiving a stimulus grant from the United
States Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service (USDA RUS) to help fund the
installation of the fiber optic lines. N-Com, Inc. (N-Com) has been contracted by XIT
Telephone for design and environmental permitting. The right-of-way (ROW) will be 1015 feet wide, and the majority of the routes fall within existing TxDOT ROWs along US
highways, Farm to Market (FM) roads, county roads (CR), and ranch roads (RR) and will
be installed at an average depth of 48 inches below the present ground surface.
Additionally, the routes will be placed parallel to existing private driveways and two
track roads to reach the homes that are to be served. One section of the line will be placed
in private property parallel to US Highway 87 and the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad
northwest of Dalhart, Texas.
AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted by N-Com to conduct cultural resource
surveys of the fiber optic routes. ARC conducted windshield surveys of the entire project
length. Moreover, an intensive pedestrian survey including shovel testing was conducted
for 30 miles of line, which are located in areas determined to be high potential areas
(HPAs) for archaeological resources (Figure 1). The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
concurred with these HPA selections.
The survey was necessitated because the project will be receiving federal funding and the
routes will be placed in Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) ROWs. The
Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation and the THC will act as the
State Review Agency. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5946 was issued for the
archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to locate cultural resources and to
make recommendations about how these resources might be impacted by construction.
Relevant federal legislation includes a Section 404 Permit of the Clean Water Act; the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515); the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190); the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291); Executive Order No. 11593
âProtection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment;â and Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.) and adopted by the THC. The following report
presents a brief description of the natural environment and cultural history of the study
area. This is followed by a description of the research design and the methodology used
to carry it out. The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the
report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study and is
followed by a list of references cited. Appendix A, a chart of all the shovel tests dug
during the survey concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Dallam, Hartley, and Oldham Counties are situated in the Southern High Plains north of
the Canadian River and south of the North Canadian River. The project area is situated in
the Kansan Biotic Province, which consists of several species of beardgrass, grama and
buffalo grass (Blair 1950). The region has been labeled as Grama-Buffalo Grass, in
which the dense and short blue grama and buffalo grass are the dominate vegetation
(Kuchler 1964). According to Speer (1980:13), the High Plains were formed from the
Rocky Mountains, as a massive alluvial outwash and are generally level, featureless
uplands dotted with playas. The USGS topography maps of the study area support this
description showing the project area as having typically level to slightly rolling terrain
with ranges in elevation between 3270â and 4510â msl. However, to the east and west,
outside of the study area, the terrain varies more dramatically and can change several
hundred feet in elevation over a short distance.
The survey tracts are located throughout the area between the North Canadian and
Canadian Rivers, with a few of the tracts paralleling the Romero and Rita Blanca Creeks.
The upland is generally covered with early Pleistocene windblown loess (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1984). Playas are present throughout the immediate area and the
Pliocene-age Ogallala formation is exposed in the valleys of the Canadian River
tributaries as well as in some of the eroded playa margins.
The project area falls within numerous soil associations on the general soil map. The
majority of the area is underlain by Dallum-Perico association, with smaller pockets of
Sunray-Conlen, Gruver-Sherm-Dumas, Conlen-Sunray-Dumas, and San Jon-Glenrio
associations. The Dallum-Perico, Sunray-Conlen, and Gruver-Sherm-Dumas,
associations consist of deep, loamy soils, while the Conlen-Sunray-Dumas, and San JonGlenrio associations consist of deep to shallow clay loams and clays (Ford and Fox 1975:
General Soils Map; and Fox 1977: General Soil Map). Near creeks and drainages, PlackBerthound and Berda-Veal-Potter associations are also present. The Plack-Berthound
association consists of very shallow to deep calcareous loams, whereas the Berda-VealBerthound association is still a very shallow to deep calcareous sandy loam (Ford and
Fox 1975: General Soils Map; and Fox 1977: General Soil Map). Furthermore, within the
project area are some small areas where Quay-Burson-Glenrio, Mobeetie-Veal-Berda,
and Mobeetie-Tascosa associations underlay surface soils. The Quay-Burson-Glenrio and
Mobeetie-Veal-Berda associations are calcareous and loamy soils, while the MobeetieTascosa association consists of deep, calcareous loamy, and very gravelly soils (Pringle
1980: General Soil Map).
Water resources in the northern portion of the study area are very limited. Coldwater
Creek runs along the north side of the study area, while the Rita Blanca Creek flows
eastward through the center and eventually runs south along the east side. One small tract
lies near Carrizo Creek, a tributary of the Rita Blanca. Along the south side of the study
area, are numerous intermittent streams including Punta de Augua Creek, which flows

east into the Rita Blanca Creek; and Hay, Romero, and Pedarosa Creeks which run south
into the Canadian River. In addition to the major drainages, springs, which are an ideal
source for water in this arid region, are found within the Ogallala Formation near the
headwaters of the numerous unnamed drainages that flow into creeks and rivers. Besides
these drainages and springs, playas are the only real source of water in the project area.
According to the Texas Almanac (2006), average rainfall in Dallam, Hartley, and
Oldham Counties ranges from 17 to 19 inches per year. There are an estimated 20,000
playas within the Southern High Plains region (Hicks 1995:19; Sabin and Holliday 1995).
Playas are formed through the interaction of geomorphic, pedogenic, hydrochemical and
biologic processes, with wind deflation being the primary agent of sediment removal
(Hicks 1995:19). Lunettes, or low crescentic dune ridges, are generally associated with
playas and occur on their leeward margin (Hicks 1995:19). These playas were an
invaluable resource on the High Plains, providing water to the numerous prairie animals
that have historically lived in the region including deer, pronghorn antelope, bison,
prairie dogs, coyotes and several species of birds. The climate of the High Plains is
semiarid with cold winters in which temperatures hover around freezing and warm to hot
summers (Johnson and Holliday 2004:284).

CULTURAL HISTORY
The study area lies within the Texas High Plains as defined by Hughes (1991). The
culture history synthesized here is largely compiled from Johnson and Holliday (2004).
The cultural history is divided into five periods: the Paleoindian (11,500 to 8,500 B.P.),
the Archaic (8,500 to 2,000 B.P.), the Ceramic or Plains Village (2,000 to ca. 500 B.P.),
the Protohistoric (ca. 500 to 300 B.P.) and the Historic (ca. 300 to the present).
This immediate area has not been extensively studied and very little is known about the
archaeology on the uplands in the northwest portion of the Texas Panhandle (Speer
1980:64-65). Paleoindian occupation is represented by minimal evidence in the Southern
High Plains (Bousman et al. 2004). Four Clovis points have been reported to come from
Dallam County, while only two have been reported in Oldham and one in Hartley (Bever
and Meltzer 2007:67-69). The playas in the north-central and eastern borders of Dallam
County and northeast part of Hartley County are most likely to have been occupied
during Paleoindian times (Speer 1980:64-65). In situ Paleoindian finds are relatively rare,
but cultural material from this period are possibly buried in playa fill on the uplands
(Johnson and Holliday 2004:285).
Towards the latter part of the Early Holocene, during the Early Archaic (8,500 to 6,000
B.P.), moisture and humidity levels decreased, reflecting a warming and drying trend that
marked seasonality and promoted eolian sedimentation (Johnson and Holliday 2004:290).
This advanced the formation of lunettes around playas. However, very little is known
about the Early Archaic in this area. To the south and southwest are Lubbock Lake and
San Jon, which are two sites that have been excavated from this time period. During the
Middle Archaic (6,000 to 4,500 B.P.), eolian sedimentation continued to be significant as
water became more scarce. Sites dating to the Middle Archaic are typically campsites or
bison kill/butchering sites and have been found in good stratigraphic context like
Blackwater Draw Locality #1 and Mustang Springs (Johnson and Holliday 2004:291). By
the Late Archaic (4,500 to 2,000 B.P.), the climate began to shift to a cooler wetter
environment and eolian sedimentation rates slowed (Johnson and Holliday 2004:291).
Materials dating to this period are rarely found in stratified contexts due to erosion. These
sites are represented by camp and bison kill/butchering sites, as well, but with corner- and
side-notched Late Archaic points.
The early Ceramic, more recently referred to as the Plains Village period, (2,000 to 1,000
B.P.) is marked by episodic droughts and the appearance of technological advances such
as ceramic vessels and the bow and arrow (Johnson and Holliday 2004:292; Boyd
2004:296). These sites have a mixed association of dart and arrow points, like cornernotched Scallorn arrow points, and coarse-tempered cordmarked pottery. By the latter
half of this period, (ca. 1,000 to 500 B.P.) the artifact assemblages are a mix of Puebloan
trade pottery and Plains lithic tool types (Johnson and Holliday 2004:293). Numerous
sites dating to this period have been identified; however, they are rarely in good
stratigraphic context. It is also around this time that significant archaeological faunal
evidence indicates that birds became more of a staple in prehistoric diets (Lintz
______________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE XIT FIBER OPTIC ROUTES

7

2009:123). According to Lintz, 38 of the 45 types of birds native to the High Plains were
represented in the assemblages. He suggests that a variety of methods would have been
used to capture these resources in the playa basins and edges including: hung noose
snares, fixed hunting nets, draw nets, nets on arched frames, and drive lanes for molting
waterfowl (Lintz 2009:Table 11).
The Antelope Creek Phase (750 to 450 B.P.) is also local to the Texas Panhandle,
however it is more localized along the Canadian and North Canadian River valleys (Lintz
1989:275). This phase is not well defined as there seems to be a lot of variation in
structures and in artifact assemblages (Lintz 1989).
The Protohistoric period, of which Garza points are characteristic, is represented at
numerous sites, yet very few contain good stratigraphic contexts (Johnson and Holliday
2004:293). Several sites dating to this period have been excavated, such as Canyon City
Club Cave site, Floydada Country Club, site and the Garza site near Lubbock Lake.
The Canadian River in northern Oldham County was an important transportation route
for Plains Indians, Spanish entradas, and European explorations and the breaks were a
place of refuge for the Plains Apache (Abbe and Leffler 2011). Francisco Vasquez de
Coronado and his soldiers are reputed to be the first Europeans to cross through the
Panhandle and Southern High Plains (Hunter 1969:1). Yet little to no evidence of this
presence has been recovered from the archaeological record. The first Europeans to
occupy the Southern High Plains were buffalo hunters and U.S. military units, followed
by sheepherders, traders, ranchers and then settlers (Johnson and Holliday 2004:293).
Buffalo hunting became big business after the Civil War as many men tried to make their
money by slaughtering the animals on a large scale (Hunter 1969:5). Specifically, the
Ciboleros (Hispanic and Pueblo buffalo hunters) and Comancheros (Mexican Comanche
traders) traveled from New Mexico and Mexico to the plains to hunt buffalo each year
(Levine 1987:48).
Historic Native Americans who sparsely occupied the Panhandle-Plains were the Plains
Apache, who were later pushed out in the 1700s by the Comanche and Kiowas as they
hunted for buffalo and conducted raids in the arid lands. As a result of the Red River War
(1874-1875), these native groups were themselves removed to Indian Territory in
Oklahoma (Abbe and Anderson 2011). Historic Native American sites are extremely rare
in the Southern High Plains since European occupation removed tribes such as the
Comanche and Apache from the area around this time. Processing stations during the
Historic period are similar to the previous two periods with the addition of modern horse
as a game animal (Johnson and Holliday 2004:293). Additionally, sites from this period
include rock art sites and crevice burials, and contain Washita points, gun parts, horses,
metal tinklers, glass beads, and other trade goods.
In 1887 and 1888 the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway was built through Dallam,
Hartley, and Oldham counties as it extended from Amarillo into New Mexico and
Colorado (Haley 1967:97). This railway was followed by the construction of the Chicago,

Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1900-1901, which connected Enid, Oklahoma to
Tucumcari, New Mexico.
However, a large portion of Dallam, Hartley and Oldham countiesâ history was as part of
the large historic Ten in Texas (XIT) Ranch. In 1881, Governor Oran M. Roberts traded
3,000,000 acres of the Texas High Plains to Charles B. and John V. Farwell in exchange
for them building a new capital building to replace the one that had burned (Hunter 1969;
Haley 1967; Duke and Frantz 1992). The ranch extended from Buffalo Springs on the
Texas/Oklahoma border south to Hockley County, Texas (Figure 2). The ranch started its
operations in 1885 and had an average of 150,000 head of cattle (Books LLC 2010:30).
In addition to the 325 windmills and 100 dams they constructed, it is estimated that 6,000
miles of fence was erected to fence in the ranch (Haley 1967:88) (Books LLC 2010:30).
By the 1890s, the ranch was running into financial trouble along with skirmishes with
outlaws on the plains. In November of 1912, the last of the XIT Ranch cattle were sold
(Haley 1967:217) and the properties were slowly sold off with the last parcel having been
sold in the mid twentieth century (Haley 1967:225).
Previous Investigations
Evidence for the prehistoric Panhandle Pueblo culture was initially recorded during the
1932 excavations at the ruins at Saddleback Mesa near the Canadian River. Later Works
Progress Administration (WPA) investigations continued from 1938 through 1941, and
the results were published by the Panhandle Archeological Society in 2000 (Baker and
Baker 2000).
Very few large-scale surveys have been conducted in Dallam, Hartley or Oldham
counties. Some large block studies in Dallam County were conducted by the USDA
Forest Service on the Rita Blanca National Grasslands, but very few sites have been
recorded or reported on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA). The largest survey
in the counties (conducted in the late 1970s) was the New Mexican Pastores project also
referred to as the Landergin Mesa and Panhandle Pastores Project (LMPP) (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas 2011; Taylor 1980). This project received funding from
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and a THC Foundation Grant to inventory
historic and prehistoric sites in the Texas Panhandle. Many of the sites recorded during
this survey are associated with late 1800s New Mexico sheepherders (TASA 2011).
The majority of the surveys conducted in these three counties have been linear studies for
roads or pipeline routes, many of which did not record any archaeological sites. The
routes for this project fall on sixteen USGS topographic quadrangles: Bolin, Bolin NE,
Buffalo Springs, Canyon School, Channing NW, Corlena NW, Dalhart West, Hartley
SW, Humdinger Spring, King SE, Pardue Camp, Pedarosa Camp, Proctor Ranch,
Romero, Spring Creek Ranch, and Wells Ranch. According to the TASA, only 39
archaeological sites have been recorded on six of the previously mentioned USGS quads:
Channing NW (10 sites), Dalhart West (4), Humdinger Spring (8), King SE (3), Pardue
Camp (13) and Proctor Ranch (1) (TASA 2011).

The three sites recorded on the King SE quad were recorded during the HDR MX survey
(TASA 2011). These sites (41HT1, 2 and 11) are all prehistoric sites, two of which could
date to the Woodland period. These sites are listed as campsites, which were possibly
seasonally occupied and contained a variety of lithic materials as well as hearths. Raw
materials for the lithics are mainly imported cherts like Alibates or local Ogallala gravels.
Alibates chert sources are located in Potter County, Texas approximately 70 miles to the
southeast and in Western Oklahoma (Wyckoff 1993). Both sources are located along the
Canadian River. 41HT1 and 41HT2 are situated in the Punte de Agua Creek floodplain
and were recommended for more work before NRHP eligibility listing could be
determined. 41HT11 is situated on a terrace above Punte De Agua Creek and was
recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP and as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL). These sites are six miles away from the XIT Telephone fiber optic routes on that
quad.
During the LMPP survey, 41HT17 was recorded on the Proctor Ranch quad. The site is a
multicomponent site on the alluvial terrace above Punta de Agua Creek consisting of
prehistoric and historic artifact scatters and an adobe house (TASA 2011). The site was
listed on the NRHP. 41HT17 is approximately 2 miles west of the routes on the Proctor
Ranch quad. Additionally, the LMPP survey recorded nine of the sites on the Channing
NW quad. Two of these sites (41HT18 and 19) are multicomponent sites consisting of
prehistoric lithic scatters with historic structures and historic artifact scatters. The
prehistoric evidence is of indeterminate age, while the historic components date from the
late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. Both of these sites were listed as being
potentially eligible for the NRHP.
Seven single component historic sites were recorded during this survey on the Channing
NW quad. All of the sites are historic structures dating to the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Five of the sites (41HT12, 13, 14, 15, and 20) were listed as
potentially eligible for the NRHP or it was suggested that more work was need before a
determination of eligibility could be made. Two sites (41HT16 and 21) were determined
not to be eligible for the NRHP (TASA 2011). The tenth site (41HT60) recorded on the
Channing NW quad was recorded during the Lynn Research on Bascom Trail project and
is a multicomponent site consisting of prehistoric and historic Native American, military,
and Spanish artifacts. The site is situated on a terrace above Los Redos Creek and more
work is needed to determine its eligibility for the NRHP. Of these ten sites on the
Channing NW quad nine of them are more than 2,000 feet way from the proposed fiber
optic routes. However, 41HT16 is closer, lying approximately 500 feet from the southern
terminus of one of the routes.
All eight of the sites recorded on the Humdinger Spring quad were recorded during the
LMPP survey. Six of these sites (41OL150, 151, 152, 153, 154 and 155) are prehistoric in
age (TASA 2011). All of them were classified as open campsites with lithic scatters on
open terraces or elevated landforms above Romero Creek. All of them, except for
41OL151, were recommended for more work before NRHP eligibility could be
determined. 41OL151 consists of a single mortar hole. Two historic sites (41OL246 and
262) were described as being New Mexico sheepherder sites and were listed as

potentially eligible for the NRHP. All of these sites, except for 41OL246, are more than 3
miles away from the routes. 41OL246 is approximately 4,200 feet south of the route on
that quad.
Twelve of the thirteen sites on the Pardue Camp quad were recorded during a linear
pipeline study for the Raton Basin Pipeline in 1999 (TASA 2011). Eight single
component prehistoric sites (41HT49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56 and 57) are undateable
surface lithic scatters with a variety of flakes, cores, bifaces, and hammerstones. Only
one site (41HT49) was listed as potentially eligible. 41HT49 is described as a lithic
scatter with a possible quarry for local lithic materials. The site form reports that one of
the Rita Blanco Canyon walls contains mineable veins and therefore they concluded that
the site is eligible for the NRHP due to the research potential relating to how prehistoric
populations mined these raw materials. Additionally, this pipeline project recorded three
historic sites (41HT47, 48 and 59). All three are twentieth century historic artifact
scatters in pastures near two track roads or a windmill. One site (41HT59) was listed with
an unknown NRHP eligibility due to the associated structure no having been evaluated.
This survey also recorded the multicomponent site 41HT53, which consisted of
prehistoric and historic artifact scatters. The prehistoric artifacts could not be dated and
the historic artifacts date to the early twentieth century; it was determined not to be
eligible for the NRHP. The final site recorded on the Pardue Camp quad was recorded
during a TxDOT survey of FM 998 in 1994. 41HT25 is an open campsite located north of
Cottonwood Draw and determined ineligible for listing the NRHP. All thirteen of these
sites are more than a mile north of the fiber optic route on that quad.
Of the four sites recorded on the Dalhart West quad, two were recorded during the 1990
Rita Blanca Lake Feasibility Study (TASA 2011). 41HT22 is a historic dump positioned
on a sloping arroyo cut bank. The other site (41HT23) is a deposit of bison bone eroding
down the edge of a bluff, which may or may not be associated with humans. The other
two sites on the Dalhart West quad were recorded during the 2009 Xcel Dallam to
Channing project (TASA 2011). Both sites found in the course of this project are historic
homesteads. 41DA45 consists of one historic house foundation and a light scatter of
historic artifacts including âsolarizedâ and green bottle glass, undecorated refined
earthenware, alloy glazed ceramics, and brick fragments. 41HT62 consists of a cement
foundation and a cement structure; various historic ceramic fragments; ceramic sewage
pipes; âsolarized,â milk, green, and window glass; and a metal hinge. None of the sites
were determined eligible for the NRHP.
A search for Historic Markers, National Register Properties, and cemeteries on TASA
revealed that none is within 1.5-miles of any of the XIT Telephone fiber optic routes. The
closest site was the previously mentioned 41HT17, which is two miles west of the route
on the Proctor Ranch quad. The 1941 and 1961 Dallam County Highway maps, the 1936
and 1961 Oldham County Highway map, and the 1961 Hartley County map show
sporadic occupation in the area over the last 60 years. Several of the houses that are
situated at the terminus of some of the proposed fiber optic routes appear on the 1961
maps and on the 1960s and 1970s USGS topographic maps.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based upon the geology, the previous investigations and the recorded archaeological sites
in the vicinity of the proposed fiber optic routes, 30 miles of HPAs were identified
(Figure 1). These HPAs are located where the routes parallel or cross the Ogallala
Formation, which is exposed in the drainage valley walls and contains cobbles of chert,
quartzite, igneous and metamorphic rock. Chert and quartzite cobbles from within this
formation were utilized prehistorically for tool manufacturing. In addition to the major
drainages and playas, springs, which are an ideal source for water in this arid region, are
found within the Ogallala Formation near the headwaters of the numerous unnamed
drainages that flow into creeks and rivers. Additionally, HPAs for prehistoric sites within
this region are typically located along major drainages, near springs, in crescent lunettes
adjacent to playas, and along the ridges and terraces overlooking Rita Blanca Creek and
the Canadian River. Based on the results from previous investigations, possible sites
located in these areas would be open campsites, lithic scatters, and lithic quarry sites.
The initial map review determined there was sparse historic occupation in the region into
the mid twentieth century, yet there is potential for historic resources along transportation
routes and near permanent water sources. Sites of this nature could be occupied or
abandoned structures, engineered structures such as culverts, bridges or retaining walls
and/or historic trash scatters near roads and drainages. Due to the narrow nature of the 10
to 15 foot wide ROW and the routeâs proximity to existing roads, the potential for
historic structures to be located within the ROW was considered to be low. The potential
for historic artifact and trash scatters was considered to be high due to the placement of
the routes along the roads.
Methodology
All 80 miles of route were evaluated via a windshield survey, while the field team walked
the 30 miles of HPAs. During both types of survey (windshield and pedestrian) the field
crew made notes about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed
areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a digital
camera. Shovel tests were excavated in areas where possible and according to the
standards set by the THC (n.d.). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and the fill was
inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. All shovel tests were mapped using a handheld GPS receiver. The
matrices of the shovel tests were described on the basis of texture and color, as defined in
the Munsell Soil Color Chart. Each shovel test was backfilled after the sediments were
examined and recorded.

RESULTS
This chapter begins with the results of the windshield survey and the pedestrian survey of
the HPAs. A description of the sites recorded follows and the conclusions close the
chapter. Shovel tests are briefly described in the text and full descriptions are found in
Appendix A.
Survey Results
The Buffalo Springs Route (N-Com routes F-MCC-A and F-MCC-A5B) follows FM 296
from its intersection with High Lonesome Road to approximately 0.5 miles past Felt
Road (Figures 3 and 4). Additionally, the route runs north along Felt Road, turns east
along Buffalo Springs Road, and ends at the Buffalo Springs residence. A small segment
also runs west along a private road, which intersects with Felt Road just south of Felt
Roadâs intersection with Buffalo Springs Road. Along FM 296, the ROW has a ground
visibility of 50 to 80 percent due erosion and the presence of prairie grasses. There are no
gravels along the north-south section of FM 296, but once the road turns east, there is a
significant increase in the presence of limestone cobbles which drops off again as the
road approaches the buildings at the end of the route. The section of this route where the
road comes close to a spring and set of small lakes was considered an HPA and was
walked. This area looked similar to the rest of the north-south portion of FM 296, having
no gravel and ground visibility of 50 to 80 percent. Along Felt Road and the small private
road to its west, the ROW has 50 to 80 percent visibility with scattered prairie grasses
and limestone gravels. These gravels are probably from construction of the roads. Also
along Felt Road, the ROW has a steep slope (almost V-shaped). Along Buffalo Springs
Road, the ground visibility ranges from 30 to 50 percent due mostly to prairie grasses
(Figure 5). Additionally, some limestone gravels were visible on the surface. The north
end of this route (near the springs) is considered a high potential area. In this area, the
fiber optic route follows closely to the existing road. The spring itself and the ponds
associated with it were disturbed by road construction, as well as berms to create stock
ponds. The route follows a two-to-three-foot high berm and road which cross one of the
ponds and avoids all historic structures. The most probable location for a prehistoric site
associated with the springs would be where the current house is located. This area has
already been disturbed by construction of the home, barn, lawns, flower beds, etc.

The Corlena NW Route (Route F-DRA-D) follows FM 296 for approximately 1.7 miles
and then turns south and follows a private road, ending at a home (Figure 6). Corlena NW
Route 2 (Route F-DRA-C) begins along Draper Road approximately 0.3 miles north of its
intersection with Tirey Lane, and turns east following FM 296 for approximately 0.3
miles. Where this route follows FM 296, it also parallels existing transmission lines. Both
of these routes have approximately 50-80 percent ground visibility and are covered in
short prairie grasses. Within the Draper Road ROW there are numerous limestone
gravels, most likely from road construction and there is much disturbance from prairie
dog activity. The portion of Draper Road which crosses Rita Blanca Creek was
considered an HPA. 41DA46, a historic retaining wall, was located on the east side of
Draper Road. Shovel Test (ST) #1 and ST #2 were placed in near the retaining wall, but
no artifacts were recovered.

The Bolin Routes (Routes C, D, and D5C) run along US Highway 87 starting at a private
drive approximately 2.2 miles southeast of its intersection with RR 102 (Figure 7). This is
the only portion of the line, which will be placed on private property rather than in the
TxDOT ROW. The route falls on the southwest side of the highway and railroad tracks.
This area was considered high potential because it was a less disturbed setting than in the
ROW and the route crosses Rita Blanca Creek. The creek crossing was very shallow and
almost indistinguishable from the surrounding area (Figure 8). Some Ogallala gravels
were noted on the surface, however none had been worked. Ground visibility was 50 to
60 percent in the drainage area. The route then follows RR 102 for approximately 1.2
miles where it turns south, heading along a private road (Wilder Farms). At the end of
this road, the line follows a different private road perpendicular to the Wilder Farms
private road, heading to both the east and west for a total of approximately 0.7 miles.
Along RR 102, there are several asphalt driveways, and there are no natural gravels. The
line will follow existing transmission lines and gas utilities in the ROW along RR 102.
For all sections of this route, the ground visibility is at least 50 percent and the vegetation
consists of prairie grasses. Along the Wilder Farms private road, there are a few gravels,
however they are probably from construction of the road, and are not natural.

The Wells Ranch Route (Route F-BKH-D) follows South Sedan Road between
Telephone Road and an unnamed private road approximately one mile west of Telephone
Road (Figure 9). The route then turns north on the private road and ends approximately
0.8 miles from South Sedan Road at the structures. Additionally there are two legs of this

route which head south from South Sedan Road, one of which follows a private road
(Dalhart Jersey Ranch) for 0.25 miles, while the other goes cross-country for 0.8 miles.
Along South Sedan Road, the line will be following existing gas, telephone, and
distribution lines. Along all of the segments in the Wells Ranch Route, there are golfball-sized and smaller gravels and at least 50 percent ground visibility through short
prairie grasses.

Figure 9.

Wells Ranch Route shown on a portion of the Wells Ranch, TX 7.5â
USGS topographic map.

The Pardue Camp Route (Route F-REY-A) runs along a north-south segment of FM 998
and then turns east and runs parallel to a distribution line (Figure 10). There is also a
small two-track road (not on any map) which follows the distribution lines for
approximately 0.9 miles. Then the line drops down a steep cliff and continues to Pardue
Camp. This section of the proposed route was considered an HPA due to its location
situated upon the high, flat landform near the Rita Blanca Creek. 41HT63 is located atop
this cliff and is discussed thoroughly in the following section. Thick prairie grasses
obscure the ground along FM 998, leaving 30-50 percent visible and there are already
utilities in the ROW. The segment along FM 998 is extremely flat with slight
undulations. In the drainage at the base of the cliff are numerous Ogallala gravels which
are not large enough to knap. Additionally, there is a small segment of this route which
runs along existing utilities from FM 998 west along County Road N for approximately
one mile. The ground visibility ranges from 30-70 percent and there are no gravels.

unnamed private road and finally turns west along a third private road, ending at the
structures which are approximately 0.2 miles from the turn (Figure 10). Along these three
private roads, there is 50-100 percent visibility along with abundant prairie grasses,
yucca, existing cable lines, and softball- to football-sized cobbles.
The Hartley SE Route (Route F-REY-B) follows FM 998 east from the ninety-degree
turn for approximately two miles and then turns south along a private road for
approximately 11 miles until the private road dead ends at CR Y (Figures 10 and 11).
This entire segment was considered an HPA and was walked. Along this route there is
60-90 percent ground visibility with prairie grasses and small gravels.

SW, Proctor Ranch, and Channing NW, TX 7.5â USGS topographic maps.

The Channing NW Route (Routes F-REY-B and F-REY-B8C) follows the CR Y for
approximately 0.67 miles between two unnamed private roads. Where CR Y intersects
with the western of the two unnamed roads, the route turns south and follows the
unnamed road for approximately 0.32 miles. The route also continues along the eastern

road for approximately 2.1 miles to where it intersects with FM 767 and turns west for
approximately 6.5 miles. The route makes a slight jog out to the north and back where
FM 767 crosses Punta de Agua Creek. Surface visibility along this route is 50-70 percent
with prairie grasses and scrub brush along the ROW. Also, there are some surface
cobbles, most of which are limestone. Where this section crosses Punta de Agua Creek,
was considered an HPA, due to its proximity to the natural water source. Shovel Tests #5
through #10 were dug along this portion of the route (Figure 12). Though the shovel tests
were dug in areas of very deep sand (four reached over one meter in depth), no cultural
materials were found. Site 41HT66, a historic culvert, is also located along the south side
of this segment and is thoroughly discussed in the following section.

Figure 12.

Channing NW Route and HPAs shown on portions of the Proctor Ranch
and Channing NW, TX 7.5â USGS topographic maps.

The Spring Creek Route (Routes F-CAS-C, F-CAS-C1A, F-CAS-C1C, F-CAS-C1C4B,
F-CAS-C1C4B5A, and F-CAS-C1C7C) starts along US Highway 54 approximately 0.5
miles northeast of the intersection with FM 767 (Figures 13 and 14). The main leg turns
east and follows FM 767 for approximately 11.5 miles, while a smaller leg turns west
along a private road and runs for 0.25 miles to Castleberry Ranch. The ROW along FM
767 is a relatively level terrain vegetated with prairie grasses and scrub brush, yielding a
visibility of 60-90 percent. Another longer segment extends from FM 767 south along a
private road (Spring Creek Cattle Company). Another, shorter leg (approximately one

22

mile long) runs northeast from FM 767 to Houghton Ranch. This segment has very few
surface gravels (most of which are limestone and quartzite) and is vegetated by yucca,
sagebrush, and prairie grasses. The last segment of this route turns south at the east end of
where it runs along FM 767 and continues for approximately nine miles along an
unnamed private road. The Ogallala gravels along this segment vary in size and some
were of knappable quality. Near the north end of the line and along the small dam, there
are baseball-sized quartzite gravels, while peas-sized gravels appear along most of the
rest of the route. This section of the proposed route and the section previously described
which leads to Spring Creek Ranch were chosen to be HPAs. Both of these legs are along
private roads with little to no previous disturbances in the ROW, cross numerous
drainages, and are located on Ogallala gravels. Therefore, the potential to yield
prehistoric archaeological evidence is high and they were walked. The northern section of
this portion of the route is where seven IOs (IO #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10 and #11) and two
prehistoric sites (41HT64 and 41HT65) are located. These IOs and two sites are
discussed in the following section.

Site Descriptions
Site 41DA46
41DA46 consists of a historic retaining wall on the south bank of Rita Blanca Creek,
where it intersects with Draper Rd., south of FM 296 (Figure 15). This structure may
have been a bridge footing, but it is unlikely since there is no evidence of the structure on
the north bank. The wall is 20â long, by 1â wide and ranged from 6 to 8â tall (Figure 16).
The bottom portion of the wall was constructed using rocks and then concrete was used
for the rest (Figure 17). On top of the wall, a portion of the structure seems to be missing
as pieces of rebar were exposed. Upon examining the top section, it was noted that on
both ends a date of June 15, 1937 was inscribed in the wet concrete. This would place
that date of construction to the time the WPA was in the area doing work. The structure
will be avoided by the project, as it is 10â east of the proposed ROW, as currently
planned. However, if any changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on
the site should be reevaluated, since no statement of eligibility for the site has been made.

Site 41HT63
Site 41HT63 is located on an upland ridge that juts into Cottonwood Draw (Figure 18).
Canyon cliffs surround the site on the north, south, and east sides, while the western side
is accessible from the uplands. Elevation at the site is 3880â asl, roughly 120â above the
canyon floor. A narrow saddle in the cliffs northwest of the site has created a gentle slope
that provides reasonably easy access to the canyon (Figure 19). This topographic feature
makes the location prime real estate for prehistoric use. A barbed-wire fence bisects the
ridge into northern and southern halvesâthe project ROW follows the north side of the
fence and only the portion of the site, which is located on the north side of the fence, was
recorded. After descending into the draw, prehistoric peoples would have had easy access
to the larger Rita Blanca Creek three miles downstream. Vegetation at the site is scrub
brush and low grasses with ground visibility ranging from 70 to 100 percent. Due to the
outcrops of exposed bedrock along with excellent ground visibility the need for shovel
testing was negated in this degrading environment.

View of the topographic saddle at the northwest side of site 41HT63
looking north.

The site is a moderate density lithic scatter at which 58 artifacts were gathered for basic
analysis in the field. Fourteen quartzite artifacts were recorded, of which four appear to
be heat treated. They further break down into four secondary and ten interior specimens,
one of which may be a core fragment. Thirty-seven chert artifacts were identified, with
one primary, 13 secondary, and 23 interior specimens were noted, one of which may be a
core fragment. One of the chert artifacts is a small, thin biface fragment that was likely an
arrow point; however, the piece was missing both the distal and proximal ends so no
definitive identification is possible. Seven pieces of fire-cracked-rock were also noted at
the site.
Three of the 58 artifacts were found within the project ROW, which also crosses the
highest point on the ridge. Artifact density increases to the north where the slope
becomes more severe. The site appears to be a deflated scatter that is slowly washing into
Cottonwood Draw. One shovel test (3) was excavated to test for buried deposits, but it
was negative for cultural materials. The shovel test contained 32 cm of sandy clay loam
on top of decaying limestone bedrock. No other possible features like hearths or teepee
rings were observed. The site area north of the fence is estimated at two acres, and the
site extends for an unknown distance south of the fence toward the southern cliff. The
eastern edge of the site is approximately 40 meters back from the cliff edge (Figure 20).
The eligibility of this site for the NRHP is undetermined. The current plan for the fiber
optic line installation affects a portion of the site with a very low artifact density and
therefore, will not be a contributing factor in determining the siteâs eligibility. If any
changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on the site should be
reevaluated.

Site 41HT64
Sites 41HT64 and 41HT65 along with several IOs were located on the west side of a
private road, where there are abundant fist- to head-sized Ogallala gravels (Figure 21).
The terrain at 41HT64 slopes at approximately five degrees to the northwest. Elevation at
the site is 3750â asl, roughly 60â above Romero Creek. Prehistoric peoples would have
had easy access to Romero Creek, less than 0.75 miles away. Vegetation at the site is low
prairie grasses with ground visibility ranging from 80 to 100 percent (Figure 22).
Additionally, outcrops of exposed bedrock along with excellent ground visibility negated
the need for shovel tests.
The site is a light density lithic scatter consisting of nine lithic artifacts analyzed in the
field (Figure 23). All the artifacts were medium-grained quartzite and consist of four

primary flakes, two cores, two tertiary flakes, and a secondary flake. Six of these artifacts
(all but one each of the primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes) were dark black quartzite.
The remaining artifacts were tan/peach. This site is a surface scatter and contains no
dateable artifacts and therefore is considered ineligible for listing on the NRHP. If any
changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on the area and the site
should be reevaluated should the site extend farther than the area surveyed.

Site 41HT65
Site 41HT65 is located on the west side of a private road, approximately 100 meters
south of a small, unmapped drainage, which flows into Romero Creek (Figure 21). The
terrain at the site slopes at approximately five degrees to the west. Elevation at the site is
3750â asl, roughly 60â above Romero Creek. Prehistoric peoples would have had easy
access to Romero Creek, less than 0.75 miles away. Vegetation at the site is low prairie
grasses and yucca with ground visibility ranging from 80 to 100 percent (Figure 24).
Additionally, outcrops of exposed bedrock, very shallow soil, and excellent ground
visibility negated the need for shovel tests.
The site is a light density lithic scatter consisting of eleven lithic artifacts, all of which
were analyzed in the field (Figure 25). They consist of six primary flakes, three
secondary flakes, one tertiary flake, and a core and were all medium-grained quartzite
ranging in color from tan to orange and some gray. This site is a surface scatter and
contained no dateable artifacts, therefore, the site is not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
If any changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on the area and the site
should be reevaluated should the site extend farther than the area surveyed.

Site 41HT66
This site consists of an historic culvert at the intersection of County Road Y and Rita
Blanca Creek (Figure 26). The site is approximately three miles west of the intersection
of CR Y and FM 767. The culvert consists of ACME bricks and large aggregate concrete,
all of which date from the early to mid twentieth century (Figure 27). The culvert
contains four haphazardly placed rows of bricks that are stacked nine courses high and
measured seven feet and three inches by one foot and eleven inches. The bricks were
originally encased in concrete, however, the top has been badly damaged and left a
scatter of brick and concrete extending into the ROW. Based on the aggregate of the
concrete, this structure is likely more than 50 years old. The culvert is at least 10 to 15â
outside the ROW and will not be impacted by the project (Figure 28). However, if any
changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on the site should be
reevaluated, since no statement of eligibility for the site has been made.

Isolated Objects
Eleven Isolated Objects (IOs), ten prehistoric and one historic, were recorded during the
pedestrian survey. Isolated Objects #1, #2, and #3 were located along the 11-mile private
road, which is part of the Hartley SE Route (Figure 29). IO #1 is two tertiary flakes, one
of which is Alibates with some retouching and the other is quartzite. A shovel test (ST
#3) was also dug in this vicinity; however no additional artifacts were located. IO #2 is an
Alibates tertiary flake. IO #3 is a small quartzite secondary flake.

At the intersection of the unnamed road from the Hartley SE route and CR Y was IO #4
(Figure 26), an aqua glass insulator still on a wooden segment. One side of the insulator
read âHEMINGRAYâ and the other âMADE IN U. S. A.â
IOs #5-#11 are located along the Spring Creek Route. IO #5 is a quartzite core
approximately 170 meters northeast of site 41HT65. IO #6 is a quartzite primary flake
approximately 65 meters northeast of site 41HT65. IO #7 is two quartzite primary flakes
approximately 6 meters from each other and 25m from IO #8, which consists of two
quartzite flakes, one primary and one secondary, lying about 3 meters apart. IOs #7 and
#8 are approximately 350 meters from southwest of 41HT64. IO #9 and IO #10 are both
quartzite cores approximately 75 and 400 meters from IOs #7 and #8. IO#11 is a metate
fragment (Figure 21).

Conclusions
Based upon the culture history, previous investigations and recorded sites in the project
area, the potential for containing prehistoric and historic cultural resources in multiple
sections of the 80 miles of discontinuous routes was considered to be high.
Previous investigations in the Panhandle have revealed that prehistoric resources have
been recorded in multiple topographic settings. High potential areas for Middle Archaic
to Late Prehistoric sites are at drainage crossings, within floodplains, and on levees above
floodplains. In addition, sites have been recorded near spring-fed arroyos; unfortunately
these settings are difficult to identify since modern degradation has lowered the water
table and leveled these areas. Finally, sites are most likely to be located on stream
terraces and hilly areas overlooking the drainage valleys.
Despite the fact that many of the prehistoric sites in the region are shallow, broadly
distributed surface sites where artifacts are likely deflated onto the surface, there is some
potential for buried cultural features in the drainages and at the edges of floodplains.
Surface scatters of prehistoric artifacts, like 41HT63, 41HT64 and 41HT65, were easily
identifiable and contained a variety of lithics. However, these sites are most likely
disturbed and contained no dateable materials, diagnostic artifacts, or buried deposits.
Sites 41HT64 and 41HT65 are similar to the numerous other surface scatters in the area
and they are not recommended for listing on the NRHP. No statement of eligibility could
be made for 41HT63 as the site probably extends beyond the survey boundaries, yet the
portion of the site within the ROW is a non-contributing factor for the overall eligibility
of the site and the project should proceed on the current alignment. However, if the
current proposed lines for the project change, the impact of the fiber line installation
should be reevaluated.
Historic settlement patterns are clearly identified from the review of historic maps,
documents, and the windshield survey. Areas identified as being HPAs for historic
artifacts scatters are those which lie in sections of the route that intersect or parallel
historic roads and drainages. Historic structures, however, will most likely be set back
anywhere from 50 to 150 feet from the roads. Since the fiber optic routes are being
placed along existing roads, no historic structures will be impacted by the project. Sites
41HT66 and 41DA46 were recorded in two of the HPA areas and both are of similar age
and on the same drainage. 41HT66 is an historic culvert on CR Y that crosses over Rita
Blanca Creek. This early- to mid-twentieth century structure is composed of ACME brick
and large aggregate concrete and is badly damaged. Site 41DA46 is a retaining wall on
the south bank of Rita Blanca Creek on the east side of Draper Rd. This structure is
constructed from rock and concrete and has a date of June 15, 1937 inscribed in two
places on the top. Based upon the date, it was probably built by the WPA. These
structures will be avoided by the project, and are outside the proposed ROW, as currently
planned. However, if any changes are made to the proposed fiber optic line, the effect on
these sites should be reevaluated, since no statements of eligibility for these sites have
been made.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The high potential areas ARC identified are based on site patterning derived from the
findings of the previous investigations, the assessment of historic resources and
settlement patterns within the project ROW, and the field reconnaissance. The XIT
Telephone Fiber Optic Lines are to be installed in existing utility corridors while the
roads are to be bored. Windshield survey of all the routes determined that no historic
structures would be affected and that routes did not pass by any NRHP properties or
districts. Additionally, there were no cemeteries within a mile of the proposed ROWs.
Five archaeological sites were recorded during the pedestrian survey of the HPAs Sites
41HT64 and 41HT65 are similar to the numerous other surface scatters in the area and
they are not recommended for listing on the NRHP. No statement of eligibility could be
made for 41HT63 as the site probably extends beyond the survey boundaries, yet the
portion of the site within the ROW is a non-contributing factor for the overall eligibility
of the site and the project should proceed on the current alignment. However, if the
current proposed lines for the project change, the impact of the fiber line installation
should be reevaluated.
Two historic sites were recorded as well during the survey. 41HT66 is an historic culvert
on CR Y and 41DA46 is a historic retaining wall off of Draper Rd. Both of these sites
were recorded on separate portions of Rita Blanca Creek. However, both are outside of
the ROW and their eligibilities for listing on the NRHP have not been determined.
Additionally, these sites are outside the ROW and will not be affected by the project, as
the fiber optic line is currently proposed. However, if the placement of the line changes,
the effects of it on these sites should be reevaluated.
If cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should immediately cease
in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified. Work should not continue until discussions with the proper agency have been
concluded.
