ABSTRACT
An archaeological investigation of 20 areas along a proposed 45.2 mile water line
in Lee, Travis, and Williamson counties, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas in May 2001. The project area traverses
two environmental zones, the Blackland Prairie and a transitional area between the
Blackland Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers. One previously recorded prehistoric
site (41TV1373) is located within the project area, but it has been destroyed by Highway
Department construction. Two previously unrecorded prehistoric sites (41LE284 and
41WM988) were identified and recorded as a result of this survey.
Site 41LE284 produced 51 flakes and one scraper in a deep sandy mantle. Its
age is not known, and it is classified in this report as a limited activity area. The main
concentration of site 41LE284 is east of the proposed water line easement and is,
therefore, out of the project area. It is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned in the vicinity of 41LE284 with the stipulation that the right-of-way
does not impact the main site concentration. At that point significance testing would be
required.
Site 41WM988 was identified by the presence of flakes, a hammerstone, and a
biface fragment (not collected) on the north side of the county road outside the project
area right-of-way. No evidence of the site was found during shovel testing in the project
area. The age and function of this site are not known. Shovel testing is recommended
for this area if the water line is changed to the north side of the county road.
Although standing structures old enough to meet the age criterion for the
National Register of Historic Places were observed in the area, not one was found
within the project area right-of-way. The artifacts from 41LE284 were determined to be
not significant and were discarded following analysis.

INTRODUCTION
An archaeological reconnaissance of a proposed 45.2 mile water line that will
service the residents of rural Lee, Travis, and Williamson counties (Figure 1) was
performed by BVRA. Figure 1 depicts the entire federal of Potential Effect, the
proposed water line route, as it passes through Lee, Travis, and Williamson counties.
This study (Moore 2001) identified 20 areas that were viewed as likely settings for
archaeological sites, and it is these areas that are the subject of this report. BVRA was
retained by the Manville Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of Coupland, Texas through
J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. of Palestine, Texas to examine these 20 areas for the
presence of significant archaeological sites.
The purpose of the water line project by the Manville WSC is to develop a
dependable supply of safe drinking water for 5560 families living in a large rural area
east of Austin, Texas. The proposed improvements include developing a ground water
source in the northern part of Lee County and transferring it to distribution points
throughout the system. The Manville WSC serves an area that is 28 miles wide (eastwest) and 22 miles across (north-south). Improvements will consist of adding
approximately 180,000 feet (34 miles) of 16 inch pvc transmission line, 13,000 feet (2.5
miles) of 14 inch pvc well supply line, and 46,000 feet (8.7 miles) of 12 inch pvc
transmission line throughout the existing service.
The new lines will parallel existing lines, generally county road rights-of-way, and
will be located on private property within 15 feet of the fence line. Although it is the
preference of the Manville WSC to place the water line on private property within new or
relatively undisturbed rights-of-way, it is their intention to avoid significant
archaeological sites by placing the water line within the disturbed highway ditch in those
areas where sites are located. Virtually all of the water line will be placed in undisturbed
easements or rights-of-way. The federal Area of Potential Effect consists of a 15 foot
permanent easement and a possible 30 construction easement with a trench depth of
46 inches and a width of 6-12 inches. The exact locations of easements and line routes
have been finalized pending the results of this study.
The project area is depicted on five 7.5' United States Geological Survey
topographical maps: these are Beaukiss (dated 1982), Coupland (dated 1982), Manor
(dated 1988), Pflugerville East (dated 1987), and Structure (dated 1982).
The 20 areas examined during this study are depicted on enlarged 7.5'
topographic quadrangles (Appendix I). These maps depict the areas actually surveyed
and tested by the field archaeologists. All shovel tests are identified on these maps and
on a shovel test log (Appendix II). Brief descriptions of each area examined are
presented in the Results and Conclusions section of this report. This section describes
the relation of the tests to roads, fence lines, previous disturbances, and proposed new
rights-of-way. The entire water line route on engineering maps superimposed on
topographic maps was a part of the earlier reconnaissance report by BVRA.

Figure 1. General Location Map
Overall, the project area is located in a region known to contain significant
archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a reconnaissance survey
by professional archaeologists was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Since this is a federally funded project, no Antiquities Permit
was required. The project number assigned by BVRA is 01-08. The field survey was
conducted on May 7-10, 2001. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Numerous archaeological studies have been performed in the Central Texas
area since the early part of this century. In this section, only recent investigations in the
immediate vicinity of the current project area are discussed. These data were collected
from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) files and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas. The focus of this study lies within two different environmental
settings; the Blackland Prairie and a transitional area between the Blackland Prairie and
the Eastern Cross Timbers (Gould 1975).
Although numerous sites have been recorded in the area, only one previously
recorded site exists within the right-of-way as currently proposed. This site (41TV1373),
located in the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area, is a prehistoric site recorded
by the Texas Highway Department in 1990 (no report available) during a survey along
Highway 290. It was later tested by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. in 1995 (Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. 1995) and found to be not significant. The site has been
destroyed by the construction of a substation that was observed during the
archaeological reconnaissance.
A number of archaeological sites have been recorded in the Blackland Prairie
portion of the project area in close proximity to the proposed right-of-way. In 1985, a
survey was conducted for the Travis County Municipal Utility District #2 by Alton Briggs
of Lone Star Archeological Services (no report available at TARL). The area
investigated is a section along Wilbarger Creek near Manor approximately 1000 and
3000 meters southwest of the current project area. It resulted in the recording of 15
previously unrecorded sites (41TV1207 - 41TV1221). Of this number, 9 are historic
sites, and 6 are prehistoric. Not one of these sites intrudes on the water line route as
currently proposed.
In 1988, Alton Briggs of Lone Star Archeological Services in Austin, Texas
recorded 20 sites (41TV1344 - 41TV1363) during a survey for the New Austin Airport
Project (also in the Blackland Prairie section of the project area); however, no report of
his work is on file at TARL. The majority of his sites for which information is available
(n=16) are historic and consist of a cemetery (41TV1344), late 19th and early 20th
century houses (41TV1346, 41TV1347, 41TV1348, 41TV1349, 41TV1352, 41TV1353,
41TV1354, 41TV1355, 41TV1358, 41TV1362, 41TV1363), and trash dumps and
scatters (41TV1359, 41TV1361. Two prehistoric sites are described by Briggs as lithic
scatters (41TV1357) and an "open campsite" (41TV1360). His investigation covered
that part of the project area along Gregg and Tower roads.
Site 41TV1741 (500 meters west of Bois D'Arc Lane in the Blackland Prairie) was
recorded by Russ Brownlow and consists of a "dubious find of one chert core, a historic
ceramic sherd, and a glass fragment probably transported by water from an alluvial fan
off a plowed field above. The field of contained chert cobbles, but all shovel tests were
negative. No data exists for sites 41TV1211 and 41TV1212 that are in the area.

In their discussion of the Blackland Prairie area east of Interstate 35, Standifer
and Freeman (1985) point out that most of the prehistoric sites in their project area and
vicinity occur on the larger perennial streams. "With few exceptions, sites located on
upland slopes are either isolated finds or sparse surficial lithic scatters seemingly
associated with lithic procurement rather than habitation" (Standifer and Freeman
1985:9). They note that historic sites are less tied to stream locales due to the use of
cisterns and wells; however, the earlier historic sites are primarily found along major
streams as well. This preference for site locations was also observed in a survey in the
Pflugerville area (Standifer and Freeman 1986:10).
The other area which has received considerable attention by professional
archaeologists is the Sandow Surface Mine in the transitional Cross Timbers area in
Lee and Milam counties. In 1997, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Tate et al. 1997)
conducted an archaeological survey of the Area I expansion area (2420 aces) in Lee
County. This study resulted in the identification of 44 previously unrecorded sites
(41LE133 - 41LE171, 41LE173 - 41LE177). This study examined a portion of the route
of the proposed water line. The four sites closest to the project area (41LE162,
41LE163, 41LE167, 41LE176) are described as "lithic scatters" and "open campsites"
on sandy hills near creeks with artifacts found as deep as 90 cm at three sites. No
diagnostic artifacts were recovered, and only 41LE176 with moderate artifact density
was recommended for additional work.
A cultural resources survey in the area (Alcoa Mine) performed by Espey, Huston
& Associates, Inc. (Tate et al. 1997) recorded numerous prehistoric sites in the deep
sands that are common in the area. This survey recorded four prehistoric sites
(41LE162, 41LE163, 41LE167, and 41LE176) in the vicinity of the project area just to
the north of site 41LE284. The artifact density at these sites varies from very low to
moderate. The sites are described as lithic scatters. Only one site (41LE176) was
considered to possess research potential and warrant additional work. This is a
moderately dense prehistoric site yielding 42 pieces of debitage and fire-cracked rock.
Because of the potential for buried cultural features and/or cultural zones, the Texas
Historical Commission concurred that the site be tested if avoidance is not possible.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by Jean
Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records, at TARL and reviewed by William E. Moore. Ms.
Hughes checked the site files for previously recorded sites in and near the project area.
Site forms were reviewed in order to obtain an idea of the kinds of sites found in the
immediate area and the kinds of landforms on which they are located. In addition,
information pertaining to previous archaeological work in the region was obtained from
the library at BVRA.
The field survey crew was provided with a letter of introduction from J. F.
Fontaine & Associates, Inc. that served as their permission to work on private property.
The water line was driven by the field crew, and each of the 20 areas was evaluated for
the presence of significant archaeological sites. The method utilized to assess the 20
areas consisted of shovel tests and probes as well as a visual inspection of road
cutbanks and exposed areas on the surface such as areas of artificial disturbance,
rodent burrows, and eroded areas.
The water line route generally follows existing county roads; however, there are
two segments that traverse cross-country. Although the area was not flagged, the field
crew was at all times aware of the limits of the proposed right-of-way. In those areas
paralleling existing county roads, the crew was careful to place all shovel tests and
probes within fifteen feet of the fence line on private property. When in doubt as to the
distance of the easement, the area was measured to make sure work was not
conducted outside the project area right-of-way. In the Results and Conclusions section
below mention is made as to which side of the road was surveyed in each area. Of the
two cross-country segments, one was not considered likely to contain archaeological
sites and was not investigated during this study. The remaining cross-country segment
was walked utilizing the topographic and engineering maps which depicted the route.
This property is owned by the Manville WSC; therefore, trespassing on private property
was not a concern.
In all, 77 shovel tests were dug. All earth excavated through shovel testing was
screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix II) was kept. It
should be noted that, in addition to shovel tests, probes were dug with a shovel to help
confirm the presence of shallow soils in some areas without additional shovel tests.
These probes were not screened, numbered, or depicted on the field maps. Profiles of
the shovel tests were sketched in the field, and these drawings along with other notes
are housed at BVRA.
Previously recorded site 41TV1373 was visited in the field by the Principal
Investigator and Project Archaeologist. It was determined that this site has been
completely destroyed by construction of a substation.

During the reconnaissance, two areas (TS-1 and TS-2) were considered very
likely to contain cultural materials based on the presence of a single flake in the road
cutbank at each of these locations. At TS-1, six shovel tests were excavated with no
cultural materials present in either of the tests or visible in the cutbank. This area was
not recorded as a site.
At TS-2, a flake had been found in the road cutbank on the opposite side of the
road from where the water line is proposed. Another inspection of this area revealed
several flakes, a hammerstone, burned rock, and a biface fragment. Five shovel tests
within the right-of-way were excavated with no cultural materials present in either of the
tests or visible in the cutbank on this side of the road. Based on the presence of
artifacts in the other cutbank, this area was recorded as a site and received the trinomial
41WM988. Since the artifacts observed on the surface were outside the project area
right-of-way, they were not collected, and a site map was not made. This site is
depicted on the enlarged topographic map in Appendix I to this report.
A previously unrecorded prehistoric site (41LE284) was found at the southern
end of the project area on land owned by the Manville WSC. Once cultural materials
were found in the first shovel test (27), additional tests were excavated to determine site
extent, depth, and significance. It soon became obvious to the survey crew that this site
is probably restricted to the well-defined landform, the first terrace overlooking Middle
Yegua Creek. Four tests produced cultural materials, and nine tests were sterile
(Figure 2). All artifacts collected from the shovel tests were bagged and recorded on an
artifact inventory log. The specimens consist totally of lithic debitage and one scraper.
William A. Dickens, a lithic specialist, analyzed them and his findings appear as
Appendix III to this report.
Three areas had been previously examined by professional archaeologists and
were exempted from this study. They are a segment of Highway 20 that was the
subject of a study by the Highway Department, Gregg and Tower roads at the western
end of the project area investigated by Alton Briggs, and the overland portion south of
county road 313 and north of county road 309 investigated by Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc.
In the reconnaissance report, 21 areas were recommended for survey. A later
check of the maps provided by J. F. Fontaine & Associates, Inc. revealed that some
overlap was present. The result of this was one area (15) listed twice as Area 15 and
Area 16. This was corrected, and areas 16-21 were renumbered to areas 15-20. Table
1 depicts the areas examined during this survey.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed the presence of one previously recorded
archaeological site in the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area (Appendix I). Site
41TV1373 is a prehistoric site recorded by the Texas Highway Department in 1990 (no
report available). It was later tested by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. in 1995
(Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. 1995) and found to be not significant. The site was
visited by BVRA and found to be destroyed by the construction of a substation.
Based on previous work in the area it was hypothesized by the reconnaissance
team that the archaeological potential in the Blackland Prairie portion of the project area
is low to medium for prehistoric sites and medium to high for historic sites. If the current
county roads follow old roads it is unlikely that historic house sites will exist within fifteen
feet of the right-of-way. Therefore, it was assumed that significant historic remains
within the proposed water line route are unlikely.
The absence of prehistoric sites in the Blackland Prairie appears to be due to the
presence of ancient clays at or near the surface in the area and the absence of major
stream crossings along the project area right-of-way. Although prehistoric sites have
been recorded in the Blackland Prairie area near portions of the project area, they were
usually found on landforms near major streams such as Wilbarger Creek.
Unfortunately, no report discussing these sites in detail is available. In the vicinity of the
project area, prehistoric sites for which information is available are typically
unimpressive and consist solely of sparse lithic scatters (41TV1213, 41TV1215,
41TV1216, 41TV1218, 41TV1219), some only producing a single artifact.
The potential for prehistoric sites in the transitional area portion of the project
area is believed to be high. This statement is supported by the presence of prehistoric
sites occupying various landforms, deep sandy soils, and major streams. The variety of
landforms on which prehistoric sites have been found are as follows. Three sites at the
Sandow Mine which were tested in 1977 (Ippolito and Childs 1978) were located on an
interbasin slope (terrace knoll) overlooking a secondary drainage, on an interbasin
slope (hilltop) in close proximity to a tributary of the same secondary drainage, and on a
floodplain terrace overlooking the primary channel of Sandy Creek. Evidence of the
potential for deeply buried sites in the transitional area of adjacent Milam County is
documented by site 41MM116 which contain artifacts to a depth of 83 cm below the
existing ground surface (Weed and Ippolito n.d.:16) and several prehistoric sites in deep
sandy soils on Alcoa mine property (Tate et al. 1997). The two sites found in the
transitional area (41LE284 and 41WM988) provide confirmation that this is an area with
a high potential for prehistoric sites.

DESCRIPTIONS OF AREAS INVESTIGATED
Area 1
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of two prominent hills adjacent to a tributary of Dry Brushy Creek (Table
1). The field survey crew excavated six shovel tests (three on each creek bank) and
found the soils to consist of loamy clay overlying dark gray clay between 15 and 20 cm.
One test revealed clay at the surface. No cultural materials were found on the surface,
in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the west side of the
county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot easement.
Area 2
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the north bank of a tributary of Dry Brushy Creek
(Table 1). The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to
consist of loamy clay overlying dark gray clay at 15 cm. No cultural materials were
found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on
the east side of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot
easement.
Area 3
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the west bank of a tributary of Dry Brushy Creek
(Table 1). The field survey crew excavated four shovel tests and found the soils to
consist of dark gray clay at the surface. Several shovel probes revealed shallow clay
over the rest of the landform. No cultural materials were found on the surface, in the
shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the north side of the county
road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot easement.
Area 4
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the east and west banks of a tributary of Dry Brushy
Creek (Table 1). The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils
to consist of loamy clay overlying a dark gray clay between 30 and 35 cm. No cultural
materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The
tests were dug on the north side of the county road inside the fence line and within the
fifteen-foot easement.

10

Area 5
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the west bank of a tributary of Middle Yegua Creek
(Table 1). The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to
consist of dark tan loamy clay overlying a red clay and yellow clay between 5 and 10
cm. One test was terminated at 30 when water was encountered. Several shovel
probes revealed shallow clay over the rest of the landform. No cultural materials were
found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on
the north side of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot
easement.
Area 6
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent landform paralleling a tributary of Middle Yegua Creek
(Table 1). The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to
consist of a red fine sandy loam overlying red clay between 40 and 80 cm. No cultural
materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The
tests were dug on the west side of the county road inside the fence line and within the
fifteen-foot easement.
Area 7
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent landform paralleling a tributary of Middle Yegua Creek
(Table 1). The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to
consist of a tan fine sandy loam overlying red clay between 10 and 45 cm. Shovel
probes provided additional evidence that shallow clay was common on this landform.
No cultural materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road
cutbank. The tests were dug on the north side of the county road inside the fence line
and within the fifteen-foot easement.
Area 8
This area was first recognized as a potential site when a single flake was found
in the road cutbank part of a prominent hill on the west bank of a tributary of Middle
Yegua Creek (Table 1). The area was given the field designation TS-1. The field
survey crew excavated six shovel tests and found the soils to consist of a red fine sandy
loam overlying red clay between 30 and 40 cm. No cultural materials were found on the
surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the south
side of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot easement.

11

Area 9 (41WM988)
This area was first recognized as a potential site when a single flake and a
hammerstone were found in the cutbank on the north side of the county road. The
landform in this area is part of a prominent hill on the west bank of a tributary of Middle
Yegua Creek (Table 1). The area was given the field designation TS-2. The east bank
was also considered to be a likely setting for an archaeological site. The landowner, Bill
Albert, refused access and no shovel tests were dug in this area. The field survey crew
excavated five shovel tests on the west bank and found the soils to consist of a red fine
sandy loam with no clay present except in one test (ST 40) which revealed a red clay at
45 cm. No cultural materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the
road cutbank within the project area right-of-way. Another inspection of the cutbank on
the north side produced several flakes and one biface fragment. These artifacts are out
of the project area and were not collected. This site was given the trinomial 41WM988.
The tests were dug on the south side of the county road inside the fence line and within
the fifteen-foot easement.
Area 10
This area was recognized as a likely area for archaeological sites based on the
presence of a prominent hill on the north bank of a tributary of Sand Branch (Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated five shovel tests and found the soils to consist of tan
and dark gray fine sandy loams overlying red clay between 30 and 90 cm. No cultural
materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The
tests were dug on the south side of the county road inside the fence line and within the
fifteen-foot easement.
Area 11
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a hill on the north bank of a tributary of Sand Branch (Table 1). The
field survey crew excavated four shovel tests and found the soils to consist of dark clay
between 10 and 15 cm. No cultural materials were found on the surface, in the shovel
tests, or in the road cutbank. The shovel tests were dug north of the county road, and
the area was investigated on foot for 1800 feet overland.
Area 12
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a hill on the north bank of a tributary of Cottonwood Creek (Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to consist of
loamy clay over dark clay at 10 cm with many gravels present in the tests and on the
surface. Additional probes identified shallow clay over the remainder of the landform.
No cultural materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road
cutbank. The tests were dug on the west side of the county road inside the fence line
and within the fifteen-foot easement.

12

Area 13
This area was not visited during the reconnaissance due to access problems. It
was considered a high probability area for archaeological sites based on the presence
of a prominent landform overlooking Sand Branch. It was later determined that this
area had been previously surveyed by Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. The field
survey crew did not visit Area 13.
Area 14
This area was not visited during the reconnaissance due to access problems. It
was considered a high probability area for archaeological sites based on the presence
of a prominent landform overlooking Sand Branch. It was later determined that this
area had been previously surveyed by Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. The field
survey crew did not visit Area 14.
Area 15
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent landform between two unnamed tributaries (Table 1). The
field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found the soils to consist of a red
fine sandy loam overlying red clay between 10 and 50 cm. Shovel probes provided
additional evidence that shallow clay was common on this landform. No cultural
materials were found on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The
tests were dug on the east side of the county road inside the fence line and within the
fifteen-foot easement.
Area 16
This area was recognized as a likely area for archaeological sites based on the
presence of a prominent landform on the west side of an unnamed tributary (Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated three shovel tests and found a red fine sandy loam
overlying red and gray clays between 50 and 80 cm. No cultural materials were found
on the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the
north and east sides of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot
easement within the corner of the road.

Area 17
This area was recognized as a likely area for archaeological sites based on the
presence of a prominent landform on the north side of Middle Yegua Creek (Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated one shovel test and found the soils to consist of red
sandy clay overlying red clay at 40 cm. This overland area on land belonging to the
Manville WSC was considered medium to high probability for archaeological sites based
on the topographic map. However, when the area was visited it was obvious that it was
a low probability area. Shovel probes around the shovel tests indicated shallow clay
over much of the area. A more likely area to the west was tested and a red sandy loam
was found overlying a red clay at 90 cm. No cultural materials were found on the
surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank.
Area 18 (41LE284)
This area in a pasture away from the road was recognized as a likely setting for
an archaeological site based on the presence of a prominent landform (first terrace)
overlooking Middle Yegua Creek to the north on land belonging to the Manville WSC.
The field survey crew excavated 13 shovel tests in the area and found a prehistoric site
that was assigned the field designation TS-3 (later assigned the trinomial 41LE284). Of
the 13 tests, four (ST 27 and 30-32), were positive yielding chert debitage (51 flakes),
one scraper, and pieces of shatter caused by heat. Once artifacts were found,
additional tests were dug to determine site extent, depth, and to collect additional
artifacts that might provide insight into site age, function, and significance. The size of
the site is approximately 100 meters (east-west) by 150 meters (north-south) and is
restricted to the very obvious landform. The soil found is a red fine sandy loam over
firm red clay between 40 and 67 cm in the area of positive shovel tests. At the site edge
a fine sandy loam was found overlying red clay between 10 and 30 cm. A site map
appears as Figure 2 above.
The results of the lithic analysis revealed a short-term occupation site in which
minor subsistence activities and tool maintenance tasks were preformed. There is no
evidence (such as large primary flakes, unfinished bifaces, or discarded projectile
points) that would indicate primary tool manufacturing tasks had occurred. In addition,
no diagnostic artifacts were recovered that could assign a definite time period for
occupation. Although the artifact density appears to be concentrated in the upper 40
cm, natural bioturbation may have been an influencing factor for those flakes found in
the upper and lower levels. The main site area will be avoided by the water line and
well.

14

Area 19
This area was recognized as a likely setting for an archaeological site based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the south bank of an unnamed tributary Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated four shovel tests and found the soils to consist of
mixed gray and yellow clay at the surface. The soils were mixed with gravels, and
numerous gravels were observed on the surface. No cultural materials were found on
the surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the east
side of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot easement.
Area 20
This area was recognized as a potential area for archaeological sites based on
the presence of a prominent hill on the north bank of an unnamed tributary Table 1).
The field survey crew excavated four shovel tests and found the soils to consist of dark
gray clay at the surface mixed with gravels. No cultural materials were found on the
surface, in the shovel tests, or in the road cutbank. The tests were dug on the west side
of the county road inside the fence line and within the fifteen-foot easement.
Summary
Prehistoric sites are present within the Blackland Prairie; however, those found
by others in the region have been typically situated on landforms along major streams
such as Wilbarger Creek. The project area in the Blackland Prairie crosses minor
drainages and the lower ends of streams that seem to account for the lack of prehistoric
sites in the areas examined during this study. It should be noted that during the
reconnaissance some areas on prominent landforms were not selected for this survey
because of the presence of dense or heavy clays at the surface. The areas rejected
were examined by getting out of the vehicle and visually inspecting the right-of-way
within the fifteen-foot easement or along the highway cutbanks. These heavy clay
surfaces are too old for cultural material except on the surface. When plowed, any
cultural materials present would be plowed under and would be, therefore, disturbed.
BVRA believes that those areas rejected for further study are very low probability for
containing significant archaeological sites. Those areas containing a hard that were
selected were done so as a test or a sample of the universe of potential areas to see if
artifacts could be found through screening or manually breaking up of clay. In a few
cases soils in this region appeared to be more of a clay loam, and it was thought that
these might be more favorable locations for finding subsurface evidence. When
identified as such, these areas were selected.

15

Two prehistoric sites were found, both in the sandy soils of the transitional area.
Site 41WM988 was discovered when artifacts were observed along the county road
cutbank on the opposite side of the proposed right-of-way. Shovel tests within the rightof-way were negative in terms of containing cultural materials. Therefore, this site was
not investigated in depth. This site is located in Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(Werchan 1983:28). This gently sloping soil is typically found on irregularly shaped
narrow ridges on uplands. Usually the surface layer is a slightly acid, brown sandy loam
about seven inches thick.
The upper part of the subsoil, which extends to a depth of about 14 inches, is
neutral, mottled, reddish-brown clay. The lower part, to 47 inches, is mottled, mildly
alkaline, brown clay. The underlying layer to 60 inches is moderately alkaline silty clay
loam. In the lower part it is calcareous. This soil is moderately well drained,
permeability is very slow, and runoff is medium. A different soil is present on the side of
the road where the shovel tests were excavated, but it does not match the soil
description in the soil survey.
Site 41LE284 was found on a sandy first terrace above Middle Yegua Creek
within the route of the proposed water line. This site is described here as a short-term
occupation site in which minor subsistence activities and tool maintenance tasks were
performed. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered in the four positive shovel tests that
could assign a definite time period for occupation at this site (Appendix III). This site is
typical of the many found in the area on Alcoa mine property. No soils book was
available for Lee County.
During the reconnaissance and survey, historic sites along the water line route
were noted in terms of their potential significance and proximity to the right-of-way.
Although several standing structures that meet the age criterion for the National
Register of Historic Places were observed along the route, not one will be affected by
the water line construction. In the town of Coupland, the water line will be placed in
already disturbed areas and will not affect any of the older buildings there. No historic
artifacts were found in any of the shovel tests

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that the Manville WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction of the water line as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that no significant
archaeological sites were missed during the examination of the 20 areas within the
proposed water line route.
Previously recorded prehistoric site 41TV1373 is located within the project area
right-of-way. However, it has been designated not significant and has been destroyed
by construction of a substation. No further work is recommended.
No evidence of site 41LE284 was found within the proposed right-of-way as
currently planned. A concentration of artifacts found to the east of the water line route
indicate that this site may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as a
State Archeological Landmark. In a recent conversation with Jerry F. Fontaine
(personal communication, May 21, 2001), Project Engineer, it was learned that site
41LE284 is on property owned by the Manville WSC that allows flexibility in the
placement of the water line and well. According to Mr. Fontaine, the water line will be
placed in a fifteen-foot permanent easement following an existing north-south fence line
located west of the site area (Figure 2). The Principal Investigator and Project
Archaeologist returned to the site area on June 20, 2001 and measured the distance
from 41LE284 to the fence line where the water line route will be placed. Tony Graf of
the Manville WSC was present and showed us the location of a test well (Figure 2) and
informed us that the fence line where the permanent easement for the water line will be
placed is 150 feet from the test well (Figure 2). Thus, the project will not affect
prehistoric site 41LE284.
No evidence of site 41WM988 was found within the proposed right-of-way. In the
event that the line be changed to the north side of the road, this area should be
evaluated for the presence of significant archaeological materials.
As mentioned above, the east bank of an unnamed tributary at Area 9 was not
examined because of lack of permission by the landowner. Since this tract appears to
be a likely area for a prehistoric site, it is recommended that the water line be placed in
the already disturbed ditch unless permission can be obtained and the area can be
examined by archaeologists prior to water line construction.
Should, however, cultural materials be exposed during the construction of the
water line in areas other than mentioned above, all work should cease until the situation
can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with the Manville
WSC and BVRA.

APPENDIX III
LITHIC ANALYSIS (SITE 41LE284)
By
William A. Dickens

INTRODUCTION
A single lithic artifact and 51 pieces of debitage were recovered from four
positive shovel tests during shovel testing at site 41LE284. The single artifact is
a laterally modified core that was utilized as a "side" scraper. Both this scraper
and the 51 pieces of debitage were analyzed, and the observed attributes were
recorded onto a coding form where the results were statistically computed and
studied.
Scraper (n=1)
This artifact is made on a small core or an early stage biface that
measures 60.2 mm long, 43.1 mm wide, and 20.4 mm thick. The material is
Georgetown flint, a very distinctive form of Edwards chert. Since it is known to
originate in a fairly restricted region from Austin northward towards Georgetown
(Banks 1990:60), its presence from outside that region can be significant in
interpreting prehistoric movements and trade.
The ventral surface is strongly convex in shape with only a minimal
amount of flakes (n=3) removed. The dorsal surface, however, contains a
prominent central ridge and has been heavily flaked over most of its surface.
One of the lateral edges has been unifacially modified over its entire length. This
modification consists of small light percussion flake scars that have regularized
the edge into an even convex shape. The edge shows heavy use-wear, and
observation under a 50 power microscope revealed a heavily rounded edge,
small deep scaler micro-flake scars, and traces of a bright smooth polish that are
consistent with use on wood (Keeley 1980:35-36). The form is typical to
scrapers that occur throughout the prehistoric period and, as such, cannot be
considered diagnostic to any particular time.
Debitage (n=51)
The analysis of flake debitage is an invaluable tool in determining a
number of activities and strategies that were conducted at a particular site. To
accomplish this, a number of attributes were coded and recorded for a statistical
evaluation. This process began with the size grading of each flake. It has been
determined that reductive processes and stages of reduction for bifacial tool
manufacture can be defined through the maximum size of a flake (Ahler 1989;
Stahle and Dunn 1982:86). Each flake was passed through a series of eight
nested screens. The screen sizes are: (1) 50 mm or 2 in., (2) 37.5 mm or 1 1/2
in., (3) 25 mm or 3/8 in., (4) 19 mm or 3/4 in., (5) 12.5 mm or 1/2 in., (6) 9.5 mm
or 3/8 in., (7) 6.3 mm or 1/4 in., and (8) < 6.3 mm.

Additional debitage variables coded for included material type, presence
or absence of cortex, heat treatment, striking platform preparation and type, type
of bulb of percussion, and flake termination. The type of raw material is useful in
determining the method and range of material procurement, preparation,
reduction, and ultimate artifact morphology (Dockall 1991; Shafer 1971).
The presence and amount of cortex helps determine the type and degree
of reduction applied to a core or flake. For example, most of the raw materials
found in the project area are chert cobbles that are naturally covered with a hard
"rindâ called cortex that is unsuitable for tool use. Thus, as the cobble is reduced
during tool manufacture, this cortex is proportionately reduced until finally
removed. Three cortex categories have been established: (1) primary
decortication flakes, or those whose dorsal surface is 90-100% covered with
cortex, (2) secondary decortication flakes, or those that are partially covered with
varying amounts of cortex, and (3) tertiary decortication flakes which are those
having no cortex.
The Identification of heat alteration can help determine whether intentional
annealing has occurred or if heating was from some other factor. The platform is
the flat surface on top of the edge of a flake where the blow removing the flake
was received (Whittaker 1994:14). These are either natural (cortex covered) or
prepared, and the degree of preparation is a variable controlled by the knapper
(Whittaker 1994:91). Thus, the recognition of platform types can help further
determine reduction strategies.
The type of bulb of percussion (a swelling located immediately below the
platform) is usually an indicator of whether a hard hammer (stone) precursor or a
soft hammer (bone or wood) precursor was used. Very prominent bulbs usually
indicate hard hammer use, and more flattened or diffuse bulbs usually indicate
soft hammer use (Whittaker 1994:185). In addition, the presence of a lipped
edge on the platform is also a general indicator for soft hammer use.
Finally, successful tool manufacture is dependant upon each successive
flake removal. When a flake is removed from a core or biface, a "scar," the
approximate size of the flake, is left on the core or biface's surface, and the type
of termination of the scar can determine whether additional flakes can be
successfully removed with the desired results. The most desirable termination
type is known as "feathered." Flakes exh1ibiting feather terminations contain
distal and lateral edges that are thin and sharp. This termination type allows
additional flakes to be removed with few problems. However, "stack" or "hinge"
terminations may prevent additional flake removal by failing to detach evenly or
smoothly. Such terminations usually result in a buildup of material and/or diving
into the surface forming "valleys," both of which could result in unsuccessful
reduction and failed tool manufacture.

RESULTS OF DEBITAGE ANALYSIS
Lee County lies within a region that contains varying amounts of gravel
deposits. These gravels are termed Colorado River gravels that occur
throughout the Colorado River drainage east of Austin to the Columbus area and
north to the Yegua Creek regions north of Lake Somerville. These gravels are
distinct from those occurring to the north (Dickens 1995:179-180) by having a
rounded less angular shape, a thicker and more pitted cortex, an increase in
translucent forms, and a more resistant "nature" to flaking. These gravels can be
very abundant and often contain varying quantities of quartzite and silicified
wood.
Virtually all of the raw material (44 flakes) represented in the recovered
debitage consists of chert derived from the Colorado River gravels. Many of
these are opaque forms of yellow, yellow-brown, gray, and gray-brown chert, but
29 (66%) of these flakes are semi-translucent forms. This is indicative of careful
selection as the more translucent forms tend to flake easier than the opaque
forms. A single flake of Georgetown flint was recovered. As mentioned
previously, this type does not occur in this region and is indicative of wideranging movements or material exchange.
In addition, four flakes of quartzite and two of silicified wood were
recovered. Some quartzites can be reduced, although not as readily as chert.
Generally, this material is used as hammerstones, heavy duty tools such as
choppers, and boiling stones. Silicified wood is usually a poor material for tool
manufacture due to its nature of breaking in chunky flat planes, although some
heavily silicified forms make excellent material for reduction. The two pieces of
silicified wood can't be positively identified as debitage, but their quality is such
that they are included in the flake count.
Thirteen flakes are complete, 9 are distal fragments, 4 are proximal
fragments, 13 are medial fragments, and the remaining 12 are unknown and/or
heat shattered fragments. This means that 17 flakes are complete enough to
record most of their attributes. Table 1 provides a list of the flake size grades by
shovel test. Reviewing this table, it can be seen that most are Grade 7, with
grades 8 and 6, respectively, the next abundant and no flakes larger than 12.5
mm or 1/2 in. Table 2 lists the presence of cortex for each of the flakes by shovel
test.

Table 1. Flake Size Grade.

Table 2. Presence of Cortex by Shovel Test.

From Table 1 it can be seen that the majority (73%) of the flakes are
tertiary or interior. Only three flakes could be identified as pressure flakes.
These are flakes that are removed by the use of a small antler tine or bone sliver
by a slow application of pressure rather than by hitting or striking it with a large
hammer precursor.
The platform type is dominated by plain platforms (8 flakes) or those that
have the cortex removed. Three are natural or cortex covered and three are
faceted, or have a number of flakes removed to set the platform up for striking
and flake removal. The remainder contains no platforms due to crushing or the
fragmentary nature of the flake. Of those containing platforms, four have been
abraded or ground in the preparation process. These preparations establish
strong and secure platforms as well as isolating them to insure a successful
removal.

Four flakes have strong bulbs of percussion, twelve have diffuse bulbs,
and the rest are unknown. Twenty-one flakes have feather terminations, one is
hinged, and the remainder is fragmentary with the distal end missing. Fifty-one
percent (n=26) of the flakes have no observable heat alteration, 43% (n=22) are
pot-lidded, crazed, or completely colored red from heat. However, three flakes
exhibit gloss and dorsal surface coloration that is indicative of removal from heat
treated cores or bifaces. It is well known that the flaking ability of some chert can
be improved by heat alteration, especially for pressure flaking.

CONCLUSIONS
The results of the analysis of the artifacts and debitage recovered in the
four shovel tests suggest that the site was likely used as a short-term occupation
site in which minor subsistence activities and tool maintenance tasks were
preformed. There is no evidence (such as large primary flakes, unfinished
bifaces, or discarded projectile points) that would indicate primary tool
manufacturing tasks had occurred. In addition, no diagnostic artifacts were
recovered that could assign a definite time period for occupation.
The single scraper recovered is typical of the tools utilized for a number of
scraping tasks that would be conducted on a regular basis. The fact that it is
made of a non-local material and the worn condition suggests it may have been
conserved for and utilized over a long period of time. Georgetown flint is
considered a valuable and much desired form of material and has been recorded
from sites hundreds of miles from its origin; therefore, as mentioned previously,
its occurrence on such sites is a good indicator of trade and/or group
movements.
The analysis of the debitage is interesting. All of the complete flakes are
small, falling within size grades 6 through 7 which is typical of small tool
manufacture and/or tool maintenance, such as resharpening tasks. However,
some of the flakes retain traces of cortex on their dorsal surfaces, platforms and
termination edges, as well as having plain and natural platforms. This suggests
that some of the material being worked was in the form un-modified flakes with
cortical edges or backed tools (i.e., scrapers or flake knives). Tool blanks, such
as unmodified flakes produced from small cobbles, often retain cortical edges as
a result of the size constraints of the raw material. Such unmodified material
could be transported and utilized as needed. Some scrapers and flake knives
are often thick on one lateral edge to help facilitate handling during use, and
some of these edges may retain cortex. The subsequent resharpening or
altering into other tools would remove some of the cortical portions of the edges
in the form of small flakes. The presence of faceted and ground platforms
indicates that careful and deliberate flake removals were being conducted,
possibly in an attempt to conserve the material as long as possible. Less than
half of the flakes were subjected to heating, and these were probably due to
sporadic ground fires after they were abandoned. Three flakes, however, were
removed from pre-heated altered material, indicating that some material was
purposely heat altered or selected from deposits containing natural heat altered
raw material.

Although not addressed previously, Table 3 shows the distribution of the
debitage to be concentrated in levels 3 and 4 with the next highest
concentrations in levels 1 and 2 with the remainder levels 6 through 8.
Therefore, the density of the site appears to be located in the upper 40 cm.
Natural bioturbation may have been an influencing factor for the flakes to occur in
the lower and, possibly, upper levels as well.
