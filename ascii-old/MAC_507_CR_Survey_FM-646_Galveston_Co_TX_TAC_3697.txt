ABSTRACT
Between August of 2005 and January of 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC) of
Houston, Texas conducted an archeological survey of the proposed right-of-way (ROW)
widening along FM 646 from the intersection with Interstate Highway (IH) 45 to the intersection with
Bayshore Boulevard in the City of Bacliff (Figures 1-5). The overall project length is
14.37 kilometers (km) (8.929 miles [mi]). The existing ROW varies from 0.3 km (100 feet [ft])
to 0.36 km (120 ft).
The investigations were conducted for HNTB Corporation under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC)
Permit Number 3697. The results will be subject to review by Galveston County, the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), and the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The investigation was limited to examination of the portions of the Project Corridor which fell
within PALM mandated survey areas and for which right-of-entry (ROE) had been obtained.
Most of the proposed corridor expansion falls within privately owned land. Of the 0.11 km2
(26.28 acres [ac]) of PALM recommended survey, 0.07 km2 (16.33 ac) of ROE was obtained.
The remainder was visually examined from the existing ROW to determine if there was visible
disturbance sufficient to negate the need for additional survey. Any undisturbed areas were
recorded as requiring survey after TxDOT acquires the land.
An examination of the existing ROW along the proposed Project Corridor was conducted during
the investigation, as per TxDOT requirements. This examination found that the construction of
ditches, roads, driveways and the placement of infrastructure elements such as gas and phone
lines have impacted the existing ROW along the entire corridor.
It is the recommendation of Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. that the construction of the
proposed FM 646 ROW expansion be permitted to proceed on the properties determined during
this study to need no further archeological investigation. It is further recommended that portions
of the remaining 1.8 km (1.1 mi) of ROW, which could neither be shovel tested nor determined
by the visual examination to be disturbed, should be examined after the ROW is purchased by
TxDOT and prior to construction. Should archeological deposits or features be encountered
during construction, it is advised that construction cease in the immediate area of the finds and
the Archeology Division of the THC should be contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
Between August of 2005 and January of 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC) of
Houston, Texas conducted an archeological survey of the proposed right-of-way (ROW)
widening along FM 646 from the intersection with Interstate Highway (IH) 45 to the intersection with
Bayshore Boulevard in the City of Bacliff (Figures 1-4). The project is found on the Bacliff
(299425), Dickinson (299540), and Texas City (299433) USGS quadrangle maps. The
investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit Number 3697 for
HNTB Corporation. The results will be subject to review by Galveston County, the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT), and the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The proposed project is approximately 14.37 km (8.929 mi) in length and consists of expanding
the existing FM 646 roadway from two lanes to four lanes with a raised median. The existing FM
646 is an at-grade highway with an existing ROW of 30 meters (m) (100 ft). The pavement
consists of asphaltic concrete on flexible base. The proposed ROW would be a maximum of 37
m (120 ft), including 6 m (20 ft) of proposed ROW. The maximum depth of impacts is expected
to be no more than 2 m (6 ft). TxDOT owns the existing right-of-way (ROW) within the project
area and the proposed ROW consists of privately owned land.
The fieldwork in the current investigation is based upon the TxDOT Potential Archeological
Liability Mapping (PALM) model (Abbott 2001). Application of the PALM model to the current
Project Corridor requires that the following assumptions be made.
1. All PALM Unit 2 areas with ROE and not significantly impacted should be shovel tested.
2. All mound features within PALM Unit 2a areas would be tested.
3. All PALM Unit 4 areas should be excluded from requiring surface survey in the form of
shovel testing.
4. Backhoe trenching is not required within the project corridor.
This investigation dealt only with the portions of the proposed corridor that fell within sections
recommended for survey by the PALM model (Abbott 2001). The PALM model did not identify
any segment of the proposed project corridor as requiring deep reconnaissance (in the form of
backhoe trenching). The actual shovel testing survey was limited to those segments for which
right-of-entry (ROE) permission could be obtained, as most of the land in question is still
privately owned. Tracts without ROE were examined from the ROW edge and, where possible,
determinations were made as to the integrity and need for survey. Additionally, the existing
ROW was examined to determine if there were potentially intact segments that might require
survey (See METHODS).
The objective of the investigation was to determine the presence or absence of cultural materials
within the location proposed for the widening of the ROW. In addition, the investigation needed
to assess, if possible, any potentially impacted archeological sites and provide recommendations
regarding mitigation measures, if any are necessary. Finally, a report of the results of the survey
to Galveston County, TxDOT, and the THC was provided.
The crew excavated 63, 30 x 30-centimeter (cm) (roughly 12 x 12-inch [in.]) shovel tests during

Page 1

the survey at preset intervals, as described in the METHODS section of this report. These
excavations produced no cultural resources.
Project Archeologist Douglas G. Mangum and Field Project Archeologist Randy Ferguson, with
Crewmember Steven Hall, conducted this investigation under the supervision of the Principal
Investigator, Roger G. Moore, Ph.D.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Modern Climate
The modern climate of Galveston County is generally hot and humid. The coastal portions of the
county are cooled by sea breezes. The mean annual temperature of the region is approximately
23Â° Celsius (C) (74Â° Fahrenheit [F]), with mean daily temperatures ranging from 30.8Â°C
(87.5Â°F) in August to 15Â°C (59.3Â°F) in January. Galveston County receives an average of 100.8
cm (39.73 in.) of rainfall annually (Crenwelge et al. 1988).
Modern Flora and Fauna
Southeast Texas is within the Austroriparian biotic province, near its western boundary with the
Texan province (Blair 1950:98-101). Pine-hardwood forests on the eastern Gulf coastal plain
mark this boundary, which is set by available moisture levels. The project area is situated within
the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian province and includes portions of the
coastal prairie within its western limits (Tharp 1939).
Grasses within the coastal prairies and marsh vegetation area are described from a rangemanagement perspective in Hoffman et al. (nd: 45). This 10,000,000-acre (ac) area consists of
9,500,000 ac of gulf prairies and 500,000 ac of gulf marshes. The regional vegetation of the
coastal prairies is characterized as follows:
The principal grasses of the prairies are tall bunchgrass, including big bluestem
(Andropon gerardi), little bluestem, seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium,
var. littorus), Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass (Tripascum dactyloides),
switchgrass, and gulf cordgrass. Seashore saltgrass is common on moist saline
sites. Grazing pressures have changed the composition of the range vegetation so
that the grasses now existing are broomsedge bluestem, smutgrass, threeawns,
tumblegrass (species) and many other inferior grasses. The other plants that have
invaded the productive grasslands are oak underbrush, mcartney rose, huisache,
mesquite, pricklypear, ragweed, bitter sneezeweed, broomweed, and many other
unpalatable annual weeds [Hoffman et al. nd: 45].
The dominant floral species of the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian biotic
province include loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak (Quercus
rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Hardwood
forests are found on lowlands within the Austroriparian and are characterized by such trees as
sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica),
water oak (Quercus nigra) and other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra). Swamps are
common in the region.
Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard (1990:12-15) define the following mammals as common
within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis

Page 3

virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus),
eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus
carolinensis), southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), Baird's pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps), salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), Marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus,),
packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison) may have been present on nearby grasslands at
various times in the past (Gadus and Howard 1990:15).
Common land turtles include eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and ornate box turtle
(Terrapene ornata), while snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud turtle (Kinosteron spp.),
river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards include green anole (Anolis carolinensis), fence lizard
(Sceloporus undulatus), common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), broadhead skink
(Eumeces laticeps), six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), and the glass snake
(Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes and amphibians are also present in considerable numbers and
diversity.
The resources provided by river-influenced estuarine and marsh environments were undoubtedly
of great importance to the littoral residents of southeast Texas. These resources are summarized
by Gadus and Howard (1990:12-15). Estuarine fish resources cited by Gadus and Howard
include sand trout (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic
croaker (Micropogon undulatus), striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), southern flounder
(Paralichthysis lethostigma), shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus), channel catfish (Ictalurus
punctatus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata), bluegill
(Lepomis macrochirus) and other sunfishes. Common shellfish include rangia (Rangia cuneata),
dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis), oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and olive nerite (Neritina
[Vitta] reclivata). Arthropods, such as shrimp and crab, are also numerous and highly
productive.
Area marshes replete with plants such as cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), reeds (Phragmites spp.),
giant millet (Setaria magna), and bullrushes (Scirpus spp.) would have formed a highly attractive
and bountiful magnet for waterfowl (Gadus and Howard 1990).
Soils and Geology
Geologic formations of the Upper Texas Coastal region are Pleistocene in age. The Gulf Coastal
Plain is the result of a series of sediment wedges, both marine and continental, created over the
last 65 million years (Spearing 1991). Their presence is the result of the rise and fall of sea level
and the fluvial and deltaic deposits of Texas rivers.
Combinations of these activities have contributed to the advancement of the Gulf Coast shoreline
and the Gulf of Mexico. The geological activity that created the Texas coastal floodplain over
the last 65 million years has added 402 km (250 mi.) of land to the United States (Spearing
1991).

Page 4

FM 646 Roadway Widening

The surface geology of the Gulf Coastal Plain is referred to as the Lissie Formation of the
Houston Group. The Lissie Formation is a series of Pleistocene-age deposits located
stratigraphically above Pliocene-age sands and gravels. Extending from the Sabine River to the
Rio Grande, the Formation fans out into a 32-km (20-mi) wide belt north of the Beaumont Plain
(Fields et al. 1983). It retains deltaic and fluvial characteristics from its composition of river
materials and of materials deposited from continental deterioration carried by streams across the
coastal plain (Wheeler 1976).
According to the PALM model developed by Abbott for the TxDOT Houston District, roughly
3,900 m (2.4 mi) of the overall 12 km (7.5 mi) project corridor is Unit 2 or Unit 2a, which
required shovel testing to some degree. All but a small segment of this area is Unit 2a, which
requires survey only on mound features. The remainder of the Project Corridor falls within
PALM Unit 4, which requires no archeological survey.
The proposed project area is depicted on sheets 3, 8 and 9 of the Soil Survey of Galveston
County, Texas (Crenwelge et al. 1988). The dominant soils in the project corridor are MocareyLeton complex (3600 m), Bernard clay loam (3000 m), Lake Charles clay (2400 m), and Morey
silt loam (1050 m). There are also significant areas of Mocarey-Algoa complex (750 m), Bacliff
clay (650 m), and Verland silty clay loam (620 m), as well as insignificant pieces of Leton-Lake
Charles complex and Mocarey loam (less than 200 m each).
The Mocarey soils are of low geoarcheological (GA) potential (Abbott 2001). They are
somewhat poorly drained soils of ancient alluvial origin. Leton loam is a poorly drained, loamy
ancient alluvium with a low to moderate GA potential. Bernard clay loam is a somewhat poorly
drained soil with a low GA potential. However Bernard soils sometimes contain low mound
features. Lake Charles soils are somewhat poorly drained ancient clay alluvium with a low GA
potential. Morey soils are poorly drained loamy ancient alluvium with a low GA potential. Algoa
soils are somewhat poorly drained ancient alluvium or eolian deposit with a low GA potential.
The Bacliff clays are poorly drained loamy, clayey alluvium of ancient origins with a low GA
potential. The Verland soils are somewhat poorly drained soils of ancient alluvial origins with a
low GA potential.
During fieldwork, the crew found the project area to be level coastal prairie with occasional
shallowly incised drainages. Scattered mounds and mound remnants were observed throughout
the project corridor. Soils varied between clay loams to shallow clay soils. Sandy soils were
observed where mound features were excavated.
Hydrology
The project corridor has five stream crossings. All but one of these streams are either modified
or entirely man made. Benson Bayou is the only named stream crossing. All the stream crossings
eventually flow into Dickinson Bayou. Only two of these streams fall within segments of the
project area designated as requiring survey, according to the PALM model. Partial access was
available for the easternmost of these two streams. However, since this stream is heavily
modified where it crosses FM 646, only two shovel tests were needed.

Page 5

FM 646 Roadway Widening

The westernmost stream was inaccessible, due to the lack of ROE. This area does not seem to
have experienced previous impact. This stream is still partially flowing in its original stream
channel.
Access was unavailable for the westernmost of these two streams and this was in an area with
relatively little prior impact outside of the existing ROW. This stream is also appears to still be at
least partially following its original stream channel.
The only other body of water potentially affecting the Project Area is Galveston Bay. Though not
potable, the water of this bay would have potentially provided numerous other resources to
prehistoric and historic settlers. However, the portion of the Project Area closest to the bay is
entirely encompassed by the City of Bacliff. It is unlikely that any intact cultural deposits
remain within this area and that is recognized by the PALM model, indicating that entire portion
is Unit 4 requiring no survey.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, which has been recently
summarized by Patterson (1995). Other recent prehistoric summaries equally pertinent to the
prehistory of the Galveston and surrounding counties area include Ensor (1991), and Moore and
Moore (1991). The reader is referred to these works for detailed data on the prehistory of this
region.
Previous investigations in Southeast Texas have demonstrated that prehistoric people occupied
this area as early as 12,000 years ago. All through prehistory, the inhabitants were nomadic
hunter-gatherers. Ensor (1991) has proposed a prehistoric cultural sequence of periods for
Southeast Texas which are as follows: Paleo-Indian (10,000-8,000 BC), Early Archaic (8,0005,000 BC), Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000 BC), Late Archaic (1,000 BC-AD 400), Early Ceramic
(AD 400-AD 800), and Late Ceramic (AD 800-AD 1750).
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of Southeast Texas is scarce in the Paleo-Indian period, and
indeed, is rather ambiguous through the Middle Archaic period (Patterson 1983; Aten 1983:156157). However, although most previously recorded sites date to the Late Archaic and Ceramic
periods, it is probable that earlier dating sites have been lost to erosion, channel cutting, and,
particularly in the case of very early sites, to rising sea level. In cases where early-dating artifacts
have been found, such as Wheatâs (1953) finds of projectile points dating from the Paleo-Indian
through Middle Archaic periods at Addicks Reservoir in western Harris County, the materials
occur in deposits with poor contextual integrity.
Sites dating from the Late Archaic through the Ceramic periods are more commonly found in the
project vicinity. During the late Archaic period, modern climatic conditions evolved, sea level
rose and stabilized, and coastal woodlands expanded. Aten (1983) hypothesizes that an increase
in population and the establishment of seasonal rounds, including regular movement from littoral
to inland areas occurred during the Late Archaic period. Particularly relevant to the prehistory of
the project area are Hallâs (1981) data from the Allens Creek project in nearby Austin County,
Texas. Excavations of a large cemetery there suggest a Late Archaic trade system that linked
Southeast Texas to Central Texas and areas eastward into Arkansas. The excavation of other,
smaller cemeteries in this section of the Brazos River drainage, including some in Fort Bend
County, have yielded similar evidence.
Aten (1983) has proposed that ceramics were introduced in the aboriginal artifact assemblage on
the Upper Texas Coast at AD 100. Ensor (1991) places the beginnings of the Early Ceramic
period at AD 400, which may be more applicable for areas inland from the coastline. The Early
Ceramic period is characterized by a continued growth in population levels. Ensor (1991) places
the beginning of the Late Ceramic at AD 800, which coincides with the introduction of the bow
and arrow. A plain sand-tempered pottery dominates throughout both parts of the Ceramic era.
Story et al. (1990) has defined the Mossy Grove Cultural Tradition for Late Prehistoric cultures
in Southeast Texas with sandy paste pottery being the principle diagnostic artifact type.
European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation in the areas inland
from the Upper Texas Coast until after AD 1700 (Patterson 1995; 249). European diseases,

Page 7

FM 646 Roadway Widening

probably introduced by explorers and early traders, began to have impacts as early as AD 1528.
At least 7 epidemics were recorded amongst the tribes of the study area between AD 1528 and
AD 1890 (Ewers 1974).
The project area appears to have been in the territory of the Akokisa Native American group in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. According to Aten (1983) this was part of the lower
range of the Akokisa where they would stay in the summer. During the same time period,
epidemic diseases, the mission system, and the fur trade acted to severely reduce, and in some
cases exterminate, the indigenous population of the region, including the Akokisa.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the Texas Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at
the University of Texas indicated that there are no sites recorded within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the
project corridor. The absence of previously recorded sites in the project area may be due to a
lack of previous archeological surveys in the immediate area.
There has only been one previous archeological survey conducted across the project corridor.
This was a linear survey conducted by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1970âs.
This appears to have been related to a high-tension power line that runs across this area. No sites
appear to have been found within this portion of that investigation.

METHODS
Shovel Testing
Shovel testing was conducted in an attempt to identify buried cultural resources within the
project corridor. A single transect was established within the proposed ROW expansion. Shovel
tests were excavated along these transects at an interval of approximately every 100 m (328 ft).
Alterations were made to transects and shovel test intervals when necessary to avoid dense
thickets and landscape variations such as streambeds. Alterations were also made to allow testing
of more relevant landforms such as mounds and stream banks. All visible surfaces were
examined for historic or prehistoric archeological materials. Surface visibility varied throughout
the project area, from 0-50% due to various types of ground cover.
The crew excavated all shovel tests in 10-cm (4-in.) arbitrary levels and screened the soils
through .25-in. hardware cloth. Soils that were too compact or clayey to sieve through hardware
cloth were broken up by hand. All materials were carefully examined for cultural artifacts.
Location, size, depth, and all other data for each shovel test were recorded on standardized MAC
shovel test forms. Shovel tests were immediately backfilled. The UTM locations of all shovel
tests were recorded utilizing recreation-grade GPS units (Magellan 315 and Magellan Meridian
Platinum [WAAS enabled]). As previously mentioned, it was determined that deep
reconnaissance, in the form of backhoe trenching, would not be required for this investigation.
Any locality producing either prehistoric or historic cultural remains was recorded on State of
Texas archeological site forms for submission to TxDOT. In addition to form information, sites
and features were documented by photographs, plan and stratigraphic sketches and measured
drawings, and crewmembersâ daily field notes. Investigations at any identified site or feature
sought to determine site boundaries, depth, nature of the archeological deposits, and the siteâs
state of preservation. Historic buildings (if any) and all other archeological sites and cultural
features were photographed, mapped in plan view, and plotted with accuracy on USGS
quadrangle maps and project maps (if available). Recommendation for State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility were left blank, as
per TxDOT procedure.
For buried or obscure sites, boundaries were delineated through a combination of soil surface
examination and shovel test excavation. Where necessary shovel tests were dug at 5-10 m (16-32
ft) intervals radially in the cardinal directions from the presumed center of each site until no
further artifacts were encountered in two successive units (or until the boundary of the project
area was reached). The site boundary on each radius was presumed to lie between the last
artifact-producing test and the first sterile unit. Information on the depth and nature of the
deposits was derived from shovel test results, as well as available surface observations. Any
prehistoric or potentially pre-1870 historic materials recovered from the shovel tests or other
subsurface investigations, and any diagnostic cultural materials from the above periods found on
the surface, will be collected and retained.
Photographs were taken of stream crossings, the existing ROW, and general landforms within
the project area. Photographs were also taken of any obvious features (i.e. pimple mounds,

Page 10

FM 646 Roadway Widening

structure remnants, etc.) and of any sites found. Photograph direction, subject, photographer
name, and dates were recorded on a standard MAC photo log.
Because the tracts along the proposed expansion are the property of multiple private landowners,
it was necessary to mail forms requesting ROE permission to conduct investigations of the land.
Of the roughly 7800 m of proposed ROW expansion that falls within areas of PALM Unit 2 or
2a, only 4700 m (2.92 mi) fell within areas where the property owners responded favorably. The
shovel testing survey was limited to these tracts.
Non-ROE Properties and Existing ROW
The following methodologies were developed as a result of consultation with TxDOT ENV
archeologists regarding the visual examination of properties for which ROE cannot be obtained
and the survey of the existing ROW.
Examination of the proposed ROW where ROE was not available required pre-field work
utilizing Global Information Systems (GIS). Maps were developed showing individual tracts and
whether the owner had authorized ROE. This was then compared to the PALM model. From this
data, new maps were developed showing those areas requiring survey and the availability of
ROE. Utilizing these maps, a survey was conducted on foot and by vehicle of the project
corridor. Any undisturbed areas were recorded as requiring survey after TxDOT acquires the
land. Such properties could include forested land and tracts with visible landscapes that appear
unaltered (such as intact mound features). Tracts with indeterminate integrity were also recorded
as requiring survey after TxDOT has acquired the land. These properties could include those
with no visibility from the existing ROW edge and those with visibility but no clear evidence of
disturbance. Finally, disturbed tracts were recorded as such and recommendations were made
that no further survey was required. Examples of such properties include parking lots, graded
tracts, businesses, and tightly packed urban housing. In locations defined by the PALM model as
requiring deep reconnaissance (i.e. backhoe trenching), the level of disturbance necessary to
make a determination of no survey required was based on the professional opinion of the
archeologist in the field. Thus, if the archeologist felt that grading on a property had not
penetrated deep enough to impact deep deposits, he or she might leave the property as
indeterminate. However, in the case of this project, no locations were recommended for deep
survey by the PALM model.
Examination of the existing ROW consisted of a driving survey. Wherever there was a question
of the level of disturbance, within the ROW, the investigator walked the area. For the purposes
of this investigation, it was assumed that the existing ROW ended at the fence-line. Wherever
this was not the case, it was assumed that the land ownership was disputed and MAC
archeologists did not enter the property.

RESULTS
Shovel Testing Survey
Between August of 2005 and January of 2006, MAC performed a pedestrian archeological
survey of the proposed FM 646 ROW expansion in Galveston County, Texas. This covered
approximately 5 km (3.12 mi) of the 7.8 km (4.85 mi). recommended for survey by the PALM
model. As mentioned in the METHODS section, this survey was performed utilizing shovel
testing along transects and visual survey of all visible surfaces. It was limited to those areas with
ROE. This sampling methodology resulted in the excavation of 63 shovel tests during the survey
(Figure 4).
All 63 shovel tests excavated within the project corridor during the investigation were sterile (see
Appendix B: Shovel Test Log). All of these shovel tests reached the basal clay or sterile subsoil,
at depths ranging between 8 to 80 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Non-ROE Properties and Existing ROW
The investigation of the non-ROE properties within segments recommended for survey by the
PALM model, revealed that approximately 1 km. (0.6 mi) of proposed ROW corridor could be
removed from consideration. This was based principally on localities with evident significant
levels of disturbance.
The remaining 1800 m (1.1 mi) of non-ROE corridor appears to not have prior impacts and intact
mound features were present (Figure 5). These portions are close to streams or stream remnants
and are the most likely to contain cultural resources, especially on the mound features observed
by the field crew.
An examination was made of the existing FM 646 ROW within the project corridor. This
examination found that virtually the entire existing ROW had been significantly disturbed. Most
of this disturbance took the form of ditches dug as part of the drainage control system alongside
the road. These ditches fill virtually the whole space between the edge of the existing roadway
shoulder and the fence line representing private property. Typically an area less than one meter
(3.28 ft) in width remained in the ROW. It was observed that even this narrow strip of land was
commonly impacted by the emplacement of buried infrastructure elements such as phone lines,
gas pipelines, etc. Field archaeologists determined that there were no segments large enough and
intact enough to merit shovel testing.

Page 12

FM 646 Roadway Widening

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the recommendation of MAC that no further archeological investigation is necessary prior to
construction of the proposed ROW expansion in those localities where ROE was granted. The
portion of the proposed ROW expansion without ROE, where a visual survey was possible, can
also be excluded from requiring further investigation prior to construction. This amounts to
approximately 1 km (0.6 mi) of the PALM mandated survey areas.
However, the segments of the project corridor that were not accessible to this investigation due
to ROE issues, and for which visual survey could not rule out the need for further investigation,
may require additional investigation after TxDOT has acquired the land. This amounts to
approximate 1.8 km (1.1 mi) of the corridor (Figure 5). This is particularly the case in the
segments close to the two stream crossings where intact mound features close to water suggest a
moderate potential for prehistoric sites.
If archeological deposits or features are encountered during construction, it is advised that
construction cease in the immediate area of the finds and the Archeology Division of the THC be
contacted for further consultation.
