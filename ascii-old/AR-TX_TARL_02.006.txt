ABSTRACT
Excavations at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site (41KR243) in north central Kerr County,
during the spring of 1989, were conducted under the auspices of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), as contracted with the Texas State Department of Highways
and Public Transportation (SDHPT). The site is an upland setting adjacent to Town Creek,
a small tributary of the Guadalupe River. Investigations concentrated on a discrete early
Archaic component (Jarrell Interval) reflecting a brief utilization of the locality by a small
group of people.
The major activity directly represented by the surviving evidence was cooking of meat
and possibly plant foods in open hearths and small earth ovens. Hunting is inferred from
these findings and the several dart points recovered. Organic residues on stone tools
suggest that plant resources were also processed, but it is not clear whether these were
foods, non-food artifacts, or both.
In Central Texas, especially on the western Edwards Plateau, at the time of this
occupation the environment is postulated as having recently re-adjusted from extensive
changes brought about by climatic swings from the late Pleistocene to an early episode of
the Altithermal and back to a brief period of relatively mesic conditions. Jarrell Interval
cultural ecology is interpreted as a response to these conditions; a generalized rather than
specialized adaptation is indicated.
Archeological research strategies and systematics must be improved in order to
advance conceptually as well as empirically toward fuller understanding of the local
prehistoric record.

FOREWORD
This volume provides a body of new data on the early part of the Archaic Period in
Central Texas. Much has been written about the early Archaic over the course of the past
two decades. What we thought we knew as "Early Archaic" as of the early 1970s has been
greatly enhanced in recent years and our configurations of these early cultural patterns
has had to be significantly changed.
Currently, the early Archaic can be seen, from a broad perspective, as including
cultural phenomena that encompassed much of what is now Texas and adjacent areas. The
peoples whom we recognize through their distinctive lithic artifacts had not yet developed
contrasting regional specializations of the sort seen later in the middle Archaic. We still
know very little about the internal sequence of early Archaic projectile point horizons and
we have but a few applicable radiocarbon assays to help estimate the span of these
horizons, let alone the precise temporal boundaries of this period. We know even less
about settlement types and distribution, intrasite patterning, or subsistence strategies.
Most early Archaic deposits are in geologic contexts that have not preserved faunal or
floral remains, and since many of these early components are buried below later
occupations, their placement within the central Texas environment is difficult to define.
With the discovery of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site (41KR243) by archeologists from
the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, it was clear that a new
opportunity had presented itself in the continuing study of the early Archaic. When the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory was approached about conducting excavations
at the site, considerable planning was done to maximize data recovery at the
site -planning that took into full account the research problems related to a better
understanding of the early Archaic. Geomorphological and geochemical studies set the
site in its natural perspective, suggesting to the investigators what might and might not be
found due to the vagaries of geological processes. Since the initial testing of the site had
indicated that intact hearths were present, an excavation strategy was developed around
horizontal (open area) exposures, designed to elucidate patterns of the use of site space
during the early Archaic. The initial testing had also suggested that charcoal was unlikely
to be preserved in these hearths. Accordingly, soil humate dating was planned and a
program of paleomagnetic studies was developed. The latter focussed on ascertaining
some of the behavioral patterns associated with hearth use: were they intact in their
present form, or had multiple firings reset the magnetic alignments of hearthstones, and
along with other activities, shaped and modified the hearth configurations?
We also knew, from other excavations at Central Texas early Archaic sites, that there
would be little or no organic preservation, or at least any preserved organic residues that
would be visible to the naked eye. Thus, we sought those residues that had been absorbed
into burned rocks or stone tools, leaning heavily on the extraction and analytical

IX

techniques developed by Michael Marchbanks as part of his MA thesis research at The
University of Texas at Austin.l
Any archeological excavation usually raises more questions than it answers, no
matter what the research design. In the case of Camp Pearl Wheat Site, the investigators
used new or seldom-applied techniques and approaches in the effort to extract every bit
of data possible from this small, brief early Archaic occupation. Because of these
innovations, Collins, Ellis, Dodt-Ellis, and their colleagues have made an important
contribution to the study of the early Archaic in Central Texas.
The bulk of the accompanying report was jointly authored by Michael B. Collins,
Bruce Ellis, and Cathy Dodt-Ellis. Although there was collaboration in preparing all of
the report, Collins is primarily responsible for the introductory and background sections
(Chapters 1 and 2) as well as the synthesis and conclusions (Chapter 6). Ellis and
Dodt-Ellis wrote most of Chapters 3 and 4 describing the site and its investigations.
Collins is responsible, with the help of Michael D. Blum and James T. Abbott, for
describing the physical structure of the site in Chapter 5; while Ellis and Dodt-Ellis
authored the sections on the cultural structure of the site, the features, and the materials
recovered. Special studies were the product of the following collaborative efforts:
magnetic properties of burned limestone are reported by Wulf Gose and Collins; results
of soil phosphate analysis were drafted by Abbott with contributions by Collins; Michael
Marchbanks and Collins authored the results of the organic residue studies. Radiocarbon
determinations were performed by Salvatore Valastro, Jr., The University of Texas
Radiocarbon Laboratory (UTRL); he and Collins authored the technical section on these
results.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Successful completion of the archeological investigations at the Camp Pearl Wheat
Site was possible because of cooperation and assistance on the part of many individuals.
The primary authors wish to thank SDHPT personnel Kenneth Bohuslav and Dr. Frank
A. Weir of the Environmental Section in Austin for their efforts from inception of contract
negotiations to completion of this report. Tom Ellis, engineer in the Kerrville district
office was our primary contact and served as liaison between the SDHPT, Camp Pearl
Wheat administrators and ourselves. It was through him that our various requests and
project status reports were carried to the "powers-that-be" in the Kerrville office. Carlton
Biermann, Engineering Specialist, was the authority responsible for arranging the
"Gradall" from San Antonio and the front-loader and summer maintenance crew for
backfilling. It was also through Mr. Biermann's efforts that we received permission to dig
up the caliche road if necessary and the loan of an old sign to cover the deep test unit. Joe
Pulido was our "Gradall" operator whose delicate touch with the machine allowed for the
careful removal of overburden. In all, everyone in the Kerrville and Austin offices of
SDHPT is thanked for their cooperativeness and assistance.
Personnel of Camp Pearl Wheat, especially Mike Burroughs (Camp Director) and
Robert Flores (Maintenance Superintendent), not only endured the disruption to camp
operations brought about by our excavations but were exceptionally hospitable, allowing
us use of the camp's restroom facilities and water supply. They also closed off the camp's
caliche road through the site and permitted us to store our equipment on their premises.
All of this made our job easier and more enjoyable.
The archeological field work was carried out by our able and (usually) cheerful crew:
Joseph Sanchez, Paul Maslyk, Bill Chandler, Karl Kleinbach, and Gemma Meha1chick.
We much appreciate the dedication and effort these individuals maintained throughout
the excavation.
Most of the basic records search and literature review incorporated into the arÂ­
cheological background for the local region was done by Anne Kerr. This critical task was
thoroughly and efficiently done to the clear betterment of the report.
Laura Hillier assisted by accomplishing the thorough and timely laboratory processÂ­
ing and cataloging of the collections back at TARL. The quality of Laura's laboratory
procedures greatly facilitated the analysis and interpretations of the collections.
Dr. Thomas R. Hester served as co-principal investigator and guided the project
(almost) unscathed through the overlapping bureaucracies of contract archeology. Dr.
Solveig A. Turpin effectively handled administrative aspects of the project for TARL.
Discussions with many people have helped us in our interpretations. In particular,
Dee Ann Story, C. Britt Bousman, R. A. (Bob) Ricklis, Thomas R. Hester, Mike Quigg,
Elton Prewitt, and Darrell Creel shared of their knowledge about Texas prehistory and the
project certainly benefited; we hope we have not misused their contributions.

Xl

Our consultants, Jim Abbott, Mike Blum, Dr. Wulf Gose, Mike Marchbanks, and
Sam Valastro, Jr., brought knowledge and expertise to bear on the data and if we have
answered any questions about early Archaic human behavior in Central Texas it is a result
of their contributions. We thank each and all of them.
The report was ably edited and word-processed, respectively, by Anne Kerr and Kelly
Scott. Anne as editor also coordinated the diverse aspects of report production. Pamela
J. Headrick produced the excellent artifact drawings and Kathy Reese-Taylor drafted the
linework figures. These efforts have earned our lasting appreciation.

INTRODUCTION
Planned realignment of FM 783 at the crossing ofTown Creek 6.4 km (4 miles) north
of Kerrville will destroy the major portion of an archeological site on the left (southeast)
bank of the creek northeast of the present right-of-way of FM 783. In anticipation of this
construction, personnel of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public TransporÂ­
tation (SDHPT) conducted an archeological reconnaissance of the area and first
recorded this site in January 1988; it has been designated 41KR243 in the records of the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin.
In June 1988 SDHPT archeologists returned to the site and conducted sufficient assessÂ­
ment (testing) to determine that the site was eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places under criterion d (36 CFR Section 60.4) due to its potential to
contribute important scientific information about the prehistoric utilization of the
locality. Of particular significance was the finding that an apparently buried, unmixed
early Archaic component was present in the overbank stream deposits comprising a small
terrace at the site. Further work was recommended. At that time, the site was named
the Camp Pearl Wheat Site in reference to its location on the property of that facility
(Young 1988).
The present report concerns excavation of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site by personnel
of TARL from April 10 to May 25, 1989. This investigation verified the presence of an
isolable early Archaic component and emphasized recovery of data from that component.
A small number of diagnostic artifacts (3 Manindale, 1 Bell, and 1 Uvalde, and 1 UvaldeÂ­
like dart point types) provide the basis for identifying the component with Weir's (1976)
San Geronimo Phase or Prewitt's (1981, 1985) Jarrell Phase of the early Archaic. In
addition to the temporal consistency of the diagnostic artifacts recovered, the geologic
context, site structure, and overall low artifact yield indicated that a relatively brief
interval of time is represented by this component. Given this opportunity to investigate
an unusually pure early Archaic component, emphasis was placed on exposing a substanÂ­
tial horizontal area of the site and recovering data useful in behavioral interpretation.
Interpreting early Archaic human behavior at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site enjoys the
advantages of apparent penecontemporaneity of the early Archaic component as well as
apparent horizontal patterning in the distributions of lithic artifacts and features within
that component. However, the effort suffers from lack of organic preservation. This
research, therefore, focuses on the recovery and analysis of nonperishable artifacts
(chipped lithics and burned rocks, primarily) and organic residues from the degradation
of culturally-introduced organic materials.
Results of this study touch upon the four topics, human ecology in the early Archaic
of Central Texas, systematics used in Texas archeology, methods of investigating prehisÂ­
toric human behavior, and geoarcheology.

2 / INTRODUCTION

In the area of human ecology it was determined that the site was utilized for domestic
activities during a brief interval of stability in an otherwise dynamic period in the geologic
history of the local section of Town Creek valley. Also recovered was evidence that
interpretable organic residues could be identified on archeological specimens from open
sites of early Archaic age. Both plants and animals produce certain chemical compounds
that are insoluable in water and capable of surviving for long periods of time with
relatively little alteration. Importantly for archeology, residues of these compounds can
be recovered from artifacts, identified, and their origin inferred. Ideally, the taxon down
to species or family is interpretable by this method, but often it is possible only to
distinguish plant from animal residues; this was the case at Camp Pearl Wheat Site.
However, the organic residues on stone tools and burned rocks from the early Archaic
component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site support inferences that the site was used only
briefly, that meat was prepared and cooked, and that some working of plant materials
was done using stone tools. The non-perishable resources (limestone and chert) exÂ­
ploited by the site's inhabitants were locally obtainable. These and other data on
hearth-use provide some insight into details of a select array of early Archaic human
behaviors.
Archeologists must untiringly strive to improve the systematics by which they
communicate about past human behavior. Results of this study at the Camp Pearl Wheat
Site lend support to Prewitfs (1981, 1985) refinement of Weir's (1976) cultural
chronological scheme for the early part of the Central Texas Archaic. We also propose
that, in light of Johnson's (1987) perceptive critique of the "phase" concept, "interval"
might be an appropriate term for the temporal patterns recognized in the Central Texas
Archaic. See Shafer (1986), as well, for similar useage of the interval concept for the
Lower Pecos Archaic.
Some relatively new methods were employed in the investigation of the Camp Pearl
Wheat Site. Detailed studies of the natural remanent magnetization of burned rocks
yielded new insight into the construction and use of the "hearths" at the site and led us
to conclude that some of these were, in fact, small earth ovens. Limestones contain small
concentrations of magnetic minerals such as magnetite or hematite. When heated these
minerals will acquire a thermoremanent magnetization parallel to the Earth's magnetic
field within the rock sample. By collecting carefully oriented samples, this direction can
be determined by paleomagnetic techniques making it possible to ascertain which rocks
have or have not been moved since their last heating-cooling cycle. Patterns discerned
in these measurements enhance our ability to interpret how prehistoric fire places were
employed.
An important result of this study is chronological evidence that the deposits from
which the terrace is formed were laid down rapidly in the early Holocene. One radiocarÂ­
bon assay of 7130Â±190 years B.P., corrected for a13C to 7300Â± 190 years B.P. (Tx 6566),
and an overlying discrete early Archaic archeological component, cross-dating from 6000
to 5000 years B.P., provide independent control on this chronology. The all-too-common
error of assuming that such terraces are "Pleistocene" in age was made during the earlier
testing of this site (Young 1988:8). With recent advances in the direct dating of soils and
certain geologic layers (Haas et al. 1986; Scharpenspeel1971; Matthews 1985; White and

Valastro 1984; Blum and Valastro 1989; Collins et al. 1989), guesswork can be replaced
with empirical evidence for the ages of many archeologically-relevant natural deposits.
Geologic and pedogenic evidence along with the radiocarbon date and archeological
information can be used to formulate the hypothesis that the early Archaic component
is the result of a single occupation event by a small social group. Several implications of
such an hypothesis are presented in the conclusions of this report.
The area of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site investigated by this project was constrained
by the existing road, the creek bank, and the boundary of the proposed right-of-way.
Within those bounds, the early Archaic component seemed to manifest a distinct conÂ­
centration the focus of our excavation - and to taper off in all directions from that
concentrated area. It is possible that other significant concentrations exist at the locality
outside of the area investigated, but we feel that no significant portion of the site remains
within the right-of-way and that no further archeological work is warranted. The portions
of the site that will be left after road construction do not merit State Archeological
Landmark designation.

BACKGROUND
NATURAL SETTING

The Camp Pearl Wheat Site is near the center of the Edwards Plateau, about 75 km
north of the edge of the Edwards Plateau where it drops off to meet the Gulf Coastal
Plain and about 35 km south of the Central Texas Mineral region. The Gulf Coastal Plain
and the Central Texas Mineral region contrast markedly with the Edwards Plateau in
regard to geology and mineral resources, topography. and soils and also show some
contrasts in plant and animal communities. East from the site, it is about 110 km to the
edge of the Plateau and the blackland prairies in that part of the Gulf Coastal Plain. To
the west, it is over 300 km to the eastern edge of the basin and range area of Trans Pecos
Texas and the edge of that part of the Edwards Plateau west of the Pecos River (sometimes
referred to as the Stockton Plateau).
As a major physiographic region of Texas, the Edwards Plateau is often depicted as
being of relatively uniform geographic character. This depiction glosses over the rich
variety of sub-areas to be found on the Plateau. These subareas create an uneven mosaic
of resources and conditions critical to peoples surviving as hunter-gatherers. There are
vast undissected areas on the western part of the Edwards Plateau that are high in
elevation, arid, and relatively sparsely vegetated. These areas contrast markedly with the
plateau's deeply dissected eastern and southern margins where well-watered, forested
valleys are numerous. Rainfall today is twice as great on the eastern edge as it is on the
western edge of the Edwards Plateau. Soil types and vegetation are variable and unevenly
distributed as are the regional faunas.
For the purpose of providing a germane interpretive context for the Camp Pearl
Wheat Site, this discussion of its natural setting is concerned primarily with a local region
(Fig. 1) of roughly 2000 km2 (that is, within a 25-km radius of the site). This takes in the
southwestern one-fourth of Gillespie County, most of the eastern one-half of Kerr
County, as well as minor areas in Kendall, Kimble, and Bandera counties. An area of this
size mayor may not constitute a reasonable resource base for foragers or collectors
(Binford 1980; Winterhalder and Smith 1981; Murdock 1949; Hodder 1978; Clarke 1977,
1978); and, being arbitrarily placed with the Camp Pearl Wheat Site as its center, it may
approximate either a complete or a partial territory depending on whether the site was
central or peripheral in any prehistoric territorial pattern (Gamble 1986). The size ofthe
territory exploited by any given food-getting group is dependent on so many factors such
as rainfall, proximity of competing groups, or biomass, that no satisfactory spatial theory
exists in anthropology (Clarke 1977). What the arbitrarily selected 2000 km210cal area
provides is a basis for describing the setting of the site that, because it is centered on the

site, has a greater chance of reflecting conditions of importance to aboriginal inhabitants
of the site than would such other arbitrary units as counties.
The natural setting just defined is almost a miniature analog to the Edwards Plateau
as a whole (Fig. 2). It is high in elevation and relatively flat on its western edge with
elevations reaching 700 meters (2250 ft) amsl, deeply dissected by numerous narrow
tributary valleys - including that of Town Creek - through much of its central and eastern
extent, and traversed by two southeasterly flowing rivers, the Pedernales and the
Guadalupe, which flow in broad alluvial valleys. This local region also takes in a small
part of the upper tributaries of the Llano and Medina rivers. Its lowest elevation, on the
Guadalupe River at the mouth of Cypress Creek, is 430 meters (1400 ft) amsl.
Bedrock in 70% of this area belongs to the Edwards Formation, Segovia and Fort
Terrett Members, and consists mostly of chert-bearing limestone with limited exposures
of shale. The outcrops in the local area are typical of the Edwards Plateau which is made
up of nearly horizontally-bedded limestone up to 160 meters in thickness. When disÂ­
sected, these formations form hills with nearly flat tops and steep sides which are often
stepped or terraced in appearance from the sculpting of alternating beds of harder and
softer rock. Advanced dissection produces narrow interfluvial ridges and more rounded
hill tops and slopes. Patches of bare rock are common on the slopes in this terrain. Chert,
an important resource in prehistoric Texas, occurs at many of the exposed limestone
outcrops as in-place nodules and as residual surface detritus. Chert also is ubiquitous as
gravels in the streams and it occurs widely as a major part of the stony residuum in soils
formed from the limestone bedrock. With some adjustments in response to soil and
vegetation cover or cycles of valley alluviation and entrenchment, these geologic characÂ­
teristics of the region have been almost constant throughout the culturally-relevant past
in the local region. In the valleys of the Guadalupe and Pedernales rivers are also exposed
areas of the largely calcareous Glen Rose Formation, which forms a landscape similar to
that of the Edwards but lacks chert. Also exposed in the valley of the Pedernales River
is the Hensel Sand Formation, which weathers to a low relief, sandy terrain in contrast
to the limestone hills which surround it. Springs and perennial spring-fed streams are
common on the Edwards Plateau. In and near the Camp Pearl Wheat local region is
found the major concentration of significant springs in Texas (Brune 1975).
The remaining characteristics of the environment - soils, plant and animal comÂ­
munities, and climate - have undergone changes of significant magnitude since humans
first occupied the region.
At least four phases of soil history can be identified on the Edwards Plateau. The
first of these began at a remote and presently unknown time in the past and lasted until
late in the Pleistocene. During this initial period, which had to be of long duration, a soil
covered the top of the plateau and remained in place long enough to become deeply
rubified. Most of this soil cover was lost late in the Pleistocene and early in the Holocene
and is evident today primarily as secondary fill in caves (c/. Semken 1961; Toomey 1989;
Lundelius 1974; Bement in press; Dalquest et al. 1969; Graham 1976; Evans 1961) but
also as remnants in a few preferred locations on the plateau surface. That this soil was
once present and subsequently removed in the local region of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site
is suggested by the presence of secondary deposits of red soil in Hall's Cave located 30 km

west of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site (Toomey 1989) and in Bering Sinkhole located 55 km
northwest of the site (Bement in press). Radiocarbon ages place the stripping of this
soil and its redeposition in Hall's Cave from greater than 12,500 to about 7900 years ago
(Toomey 1989:8) and at Bering Sinkhole from roughly 7000 to 5000 years ago (Bement
in press).
The second edaphic period is less well represented in Central Texas caves or has
gone less noticed. Its clearest expression is at Bering Sinkhole where it is dated to around
5000 to 3000 years ago (Bement in press). The material is a dark brown clay loam with
moderate organic content. This deposit appears to represent erosion of a moderately
well-developed soil with A and B horizons becoming mixed in the secondary deposit. No
in-place soils on the plateau surface are yet correlated with this deposit, but they probably
exist.
Dark colored, loamy soils prevail on the plateau today and have throughout much
of the Holocene. These soils constitute the third edaphic period of the local region and
are also evident as secondary deposits in caves, always overlying deposits derived from
the red soils except at Bering Sinkhole where they rest on the dark brown clay loam.
Radiocarbon ages at Bering Sinkhole indicate accumulation of deposits derived from this
soil over the last 2600 years (Bement in press). Archeological remains of Holocene age
are commonly buried in these dark soils, affirming their chronological position (Toomey
1989; Bement in press).
Holmes Semken (1961) has suggested that abusive agrarian practices in historic
times have resulted in loss of much of the sandier and siltier soils of the Edwards Plateau
to produce the most recent edaphic period. This he bases on the nearly total disapÂ­
pearance of the gophers (geomyids) since overgrazing and farming disrupted the
vegetative cover and prompted widespread erosion on so much of the plateau during the
last 100 or so years.
The validity of the edaphic sequence proposed here is not known nor is the sigÂ­
nificance of the inferred sequence to human adaptations in the region. However, it does
seem evident that changes in the soils on the Edwards Plateau have occurred and it is
axiomatic that considerable change in environmental variables is implied. Since the
evidence considered here is from sediments inferred to have been derived from erosion
of soils, the conditions which triggered the erosion are what is being dated, not the times
of soil formation. More direct investigation of older soils on the plateau is needed.
Holocene vegetation changes in the 2000 km 2 surrounding the Camp Pearl.Wheat
Site must be inferred from meager evidence at widely scattered points on and near the
Edwards Plateau (Bryant and Shafer 1977; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Wenjger 1984;
Blair 1950). It is clear that changes have occurred in the composition, distribution, and
condition of plant communities of the region. Early accounts by Europeans and
Euroamericans describe an interesting vegetational pattern for much of the area that is
now Kerr County (Weniger 1984). Although dense "cedar brakes" and open areas were
to be found in the "Hill Country," by far the most common plant community was
deciduous forest with prairie grasses growing under and around the trees. This mix of
prairie and forest species varied in relative proportions to produce what might pass for

10 I BACKGROUND

savannas where there were fewer trees and forests where trees were prevalent. Clearing
and overgrazing in the last 100 to 150 years has destroyed all but minute remnants of this
type of plant community. The grasses have suffered the most in this process so that, even
where trees have survived, the native species of grasses no longer grow among them.
Trees in these forests included juniper, live oaks, deciduous oaks, elm, hackberry, perÂ­
simmon, sumac, and mesquite. Riparian forests of cottonwood, walnut, pecan, cypress,
and bois-d'arc were to be found along streams. A few xeric species (cacti, agave, and
beargrass) also occurred particularly in drier areas of the local region.
Pollen evidence (Bryant and Shafer 1977; Bryant and Holloway 1985) as well as
integrated pollen and faunal data (Stephen A. Hall, personal communication 1989) add
to the time depth of this floral reconstruction. A long term trend toward warmer and
drier conditions as well as a shift to a less equable climate over the last 15,000 years seems
evident. Relative proportions of the plant species making up the long succession of plant
communities in this trend have changed with few species appearing or disappearing.
Operation of the critical variables in human ecology cannot be discerned in the available
floral record. For example, the pollen spectrum for a savanna-parkland would likely be
indistinguishable from that for the grassey forest inferred by Weniger (1984). UnforÂ­
tunately, we have no pollen signature for the latter nor do we know if the two would be
significantly different habitats for humans. What is clear is that grasses and mixed tree
species prevail in the pollen spectra over much of the last 15,000 years on and near the
Edwards Plateau.
Faunal change is also evident over the culturally-relevant past on the Edwards
Plateau and surrounding areas (Blair 1950; Davis 1974; Graham 1987; Lundelius et al.
1983; Graham and Lundelius 1984; Toomey 1989; Semken 1961). Present fauna are part
of Blair's (1950) Balconian biotic province, characterized primarily by species with ranges
extending into other biotic provinces. Blair (1950) states that 57 species of mammals, 1
land turtle, 16 species of lizards, 36 species of snakes, and 22 species of amphibians
comprise the terrestrial fauna of the Balconian Biotic Province. There are in addition
numerous species of indigenous, as well as migratory, birds characteristic of the region.
Fish of several species, and various terrestrial, as well as aquatic, molluscs round out the
fauna. Many of these present-day species were or potentially were of economic imporÂ­
tance to humans operating as food getters, including opossum, black bear, raccoon,
badger, the foxes, coyote, the wolves, the cats, the mice, the squirrels, prairie dog, the
gophers, the hares, jackrabbit, white-tailed deer, turkey, quail, migratory waterfowl,
fresh-water mussels, and the fishes. The collared peccary (javelina), nine-banded arÂ­
madillo, rock squirrel, ringtail, and porcupine are species among the modern fauna of the
region that have arrived in recent decades and were evidently not part of the regional
fauna throughout most ofthe Holocene (Graham 1987). In contrast, extirpated or extinct
species absent from the modern fauna include species ofsubstantial importance to people
at various times in the Holocene; these include beaver, bison and pronghorn antelope.
Late Pleistocene faunal assemblages have been characterized as "disharmonious"
(Lundelius et al. 1983) because species that today occupy widely separated ranges
occupied the same range. This is taken to mean that environmental-particularly
climatic-conditions were more equable without the extremes that today serve to limit

REGIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND / 11

the ranges of some species. The widespread faunal extinctions that characterized the end
of the Pleistocene significantly altered the makeup of the local fauna. Now-extinct species
that may have been important to humans in the waning millenia of the Pleistocene include
mammoth, horse, camel, and giant turtle (Graham 1987; Toomey 1989; Graham 1976).
The time seems near when the Quaternary histories of fauna (e.g., Graham 1987),
flora (Bryant and Holloway 1985), and geomorphology (e.g., Blum and Valastro 1989) on
the Edwards Plateau can be correlated on the basis of radiocarbon dating and integrated
to produce a comprehensive environmental reconstruction. When this synthesis is
produced and combined with the Central Texas archeological record, a major contribuÂ­
tion to the study of human ecology will result.
REGIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Situated as it is near the southern margin of the Edwards Plateau, the Camp Pearl
Wheat Site is well within the Central Texas archeological region of Texas (Suhm et al.
1954; Suhm 1960; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981, 1985), one of the more extensively studied
of such areas in the state (Fig. 1). The prehistoric archeological record of this region
represents a long succession of hunter-gatherer adaptations without evidence for major
cultural changes. Various constructs have been proposed for organizing this record and
several issues have been identified as needing investigation. These organizational
schemes have been concerned primarily with systematics and derive their salient characÂ­
teristics from the Midwestern Taxonomic System (McKern 1939) and from the stage
concepts of Willey and Phillips (1958). Early versions of these schemes have been
discussed and substantially modified by Weir (1976) and by Prewitt (1981). Chronology
of diagnostic artifact types as determined stratigraphically and radiometrically is at the
heart of the schemes of Weir and of Prewitt. These have been severely criticized by
Johnson (1987) as having little meaning in terms of human behavior. Johnson's criticisms
are, to an extent, valid, but not sufficient to detract from the value of these schemes for
chronologically organizing the long archeological record of Central Texas. The present
investigation of an essentially single-component site is not suited for addressing longÂ­
term cultural change, but it is well suited for addressing human behavior during a brief
interval in the local chronology.
A rendition of the chronological schemes of Weir (1976) and of Prewitt (1985) is
shown in Table 1. Although both Weir and Prewitt referred to the named temporal
divisions as "phases" in their respective schemes, they are more appropriately termed
"intervals." In this report, we recognize the three major periods, Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric but refer to the named, temporal subdivisions of the Archaic Period
as intervals. In these terms, the principal component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site falls
within the early part of the Archaic Period, Weir's San Geronimo or Prewitt's Jarrell
"Phase."
For Central Texas in general, the periods reflect what are presumed to be shifts in
fundamental adaptive strategies. The Paleoindian Period has been characterized as a
time when subsistence depended primarily on the hunting of large game, many species
of which became extinct 11,000 to 10,000 years ago with the waning of the Pleistocene

Epoch. Concomittent with big-game hunting would be a nomadic life style, specialized
weaponry, and relative low density of human population. There is no doubt that the
hunting of big game was a significant activity in this period, however, there is increasing
evidence that plant foods and small game were also important in the overall subsistence
base. It seems reasonable to assume that the relative importance of large game, small
game, and edible plants varied with changing conditions in time and space and that full
understanding of terminal Pleistocene human adaptation will come only with better data
on these patterns of resource exploitation.
The Archaic Period is generally described as being a time of hunting-and-gathering
adaptations that followed the end of the Pleistocene. Various plant and animal species
were exploited by people in the Archaic. Semi-nomadic to nomadic movements are likely
manifestations of this adaptation. In the sense that the subsistence base remained
fundamentally the same over the entire span of the Archaic, the period may be referred
to as stable or conservative; however, considerable change did occur. It is unclear what
is indicated by changing patterns in the nature of sites, features within sites, relative
frequencies of artifact forms, and styles within given artifact forms during the Archaic
Period. Most research issues pertaining to the Archaic in Central Texas are concerned
with aspects of these changes over time. Later in this report, theoretical and empirical
aspects of investigating these issues are discussed.
The Late Prehistoric Period is recognized statewide by adoption of the bow-andÂ­
arrow as evidenced archeologically by the presence of small arrow points. In some areas
of the state, including Central Texas, relatively infrequent occurrences of pottery also
characterize the Late Prehistoric Period, but the general subsistence base is considered
to be little changed from the hunting and gathering modes of the Archaic Period.
Elsewhere, as in eastern Texas, far western Texas, and parts of the plains, sedentism or
semisedentism and horticultural pursuits characterize the Late Prehistoric.
All three of the prehistoric archeological periods are represented by sites within 25
km of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site, according to records on file at TARL. These records
have accumulated over several decades through the efforts of numerous individuals and
organizations, professional and nonprofessional. The data are not without numerous
problems (such as discrepancies in site designations, incomplete information on some
sites, meager descriptions of artifacts at some sites, etc.), but a generalized summary of
the sites in the 2000 km 2 region around the Camp Pearl Wheat Site can be based on this
information.
Information was extracted from TARL files and existing reports on 469 sites within
25 km of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site (Amini-Minor 1981; Briggs 1971; Sollberger and
Hester 1972; G. Hall 1977; Griffin 1976; Labadie 1987; Skinner 1974, 1979a, 1979b,
1979c). These 469 sites are comprised of 549 "components," meaning, in this case, the
general periods Paleoindian, early Archaic, middle Archaic, late Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric. Three sites manifest all 5 components, 5 sites yielded evidence of 4 comÂ­
ponents, 9 sites are reported to have 3 components, 35 have 2, and 213 have l.
Time-diagnostic artifacts are the basis for these component identificatio~s; 204 sites
produced no such artifacts and are considered to be "unidentified prehistoric." The
numbers of components per time period are as follows: Paleoindian, 11; early Archaic,

14 I BACKGROUND

22; middle Archaic, 47; late Archaic, 52; Late Prehistoric, 34. The trend of increasing
frequency from Paleoindian to late Archaic with a drop in the Late Prehistoric is common
in Texas, especially Central Texas (Prewitt 1985; Shafer 1971; Thomas 1978; Skinner 1981;
Weir 1976), but it is not at all clear that these numbers reflect human population numbers
as is commonly suggested. Human behavior, as well as natural factors in the site
formation process, affect the presence and visibility of sites in the present archeological
record (Collins 1975). These must be adequately understood and controlled in any
research that seeks to use component frequencies in estimating relative population sizes
over time.
Typically, these prehistoric sites consist of burned rock and chipped lithics visible
at the surface. At some sites, these materials are densely concentrated while at others
they are sparsely scattered. In some cases, features such as hearths or bedrock mortars
also occur. Burned rock midden features occur at 186 (39%) of the sites in this regional
sample.
The 22 sites at which early Archaic materials were found are the ones especially
pertinent to the present study. Because of the nonsystematic way in which these sites
came to be recorded, the data cannot be considered statistically representative, however,
some trends in the characteristics of these sites may be indicative of valid patterns.
Only 5 of these 22 sites seem to be single component, early Archaic sites. Of the 17
sites with multiple components, 7 have a Paleoindian component along with the early
Archaic component. All of the 17 multiple-component sites have at least one more recent
component, definitely indicating that areas suitable for utilization in the early Archaic
tended to be suitable at other times and possibly indicating that the reported early
Archaic occurrences are often on stable surfaces where younger and older materials are
also exposed. Alternatively, in those several sites with burned rock middens and large
numbers of artifacts diagnostic of the middle and late Archaic and only a single or a few
early Archaic specimens, there may actually not be an early Archaic component at the
site. Instead, the early specimens may be intrusive.
Sites with early Archaic components are not randomly distributed in the Camp Pearl
Wheat local region. In terms of the regional landscape, 2 of the 22 early Archaic sites
are in major stream valleys and both of these are actually situated on terraces of small
creeks near their confluences with the Guadalupe River. Five of the 22 are beside small
to moderate-sized creeks roughly midway along the drainages between their headwaters
and their mouths. Four of these five are on terraces and one is on the valley slope adjacent
to a creek terrace. Fifteen of the 22 are in the far upper reaches of drainages. Of these
15, 13 occur on or immediately adjacent to terraces of small creeks. The other two are
on slopes near the crests of hills.
.
When viewed in light of the foregoing data, the setting of the Camp Pearl Wheat
Site on the terrace of a small stream in the uplands is typical of early Archaic sites in the
region. Skinner (1974) observed the common occurrence of small sites in the uplands of
this region, but interpreted these as specialized extractive sites linked to base camps in
the major (Guadalupe) river valley. This settlement-pattern model failed to take into
account two important facts. First, in his model Skinner failed to demonstrate contemÂ­

REGIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND / 15

poraneity more precisely than Archaic so that in his data, base camps tend to be several
millennia younger than the supposedly associated extractive sites.
It is also likely that geomorphic change over the last 12,000 years has drastically
distorted patterns of site distribution. For example, almost no early Holocene fill is
exposed in the major stream valleys and almost no late Holocene fill occurs in the upper
reaches of small streams in the local region (c/. Blum and Valastro 1989), The sigÂ­
nificance of this is that, although the Camp Pearl Wheat Site is apparently representative
of known early Archaic sites in the region, it is probably not representative of early
Archaic land use patterns. That is, exposure of early Holocene geologic deposits with
preserved early Archaic archeological components is greater in the upper reaches of
drainages than in other settings in this region.

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Camp Pearl Wheat Site (41KR243) lies in eastern Kerr County on the south
bank of Town Creek approximately 2.5 km south of the Kerr-Gillespie county line and 6
km north of the city of Kerrville (Fig. 1). The site occupies a portion of an early Holocene
alluvial terrace at the point where FM 783 crosses Town Creek. The location has an open
aspect and the terrace surface, although relatively flat, slopes gently to the west and
northwest where it ends in a steep embankment. Much of the arboreal vegetation has
been cleared from the terrace within and east of the proposed right-of-way; lawn grasses
and a few large junipers dominate the area of the proposed right-of-way south of the
terrace edge while the terrace edge itself remains well-covered in smaller junipers (Fig.
3a,b). A few small live oaks are also present at the extreme southern end of the proposed
right-of-way. According to the USGS 7.5' Series Kerrville Quadrangle; Site 41KR243
lies at an elevation of 539.5 meters (1770 ft) amsl.
The property on which 41KR243 is located has been under the ownership of the
Assemblies of God, Camp Pearl Wheat summer camp, for at least 25 years (SDHPT
1989). The area containing the site is bordered on the west and south by the existing FM
783 roadway which also imposes an artificial western limit on the site (Fig. 4). The
modern channel of Town Creek lies along the northern limit while the eastern boundary
is roughly marked by the base of a steep hill which forms the south wall of the creek's
valley. A number of improvements have been made in this area of the property during
the camp's operation. These improvements include the construction of private access
roads, a wooden fence, drainage ditches, volleyball courts, several structures, powerlines,
and land clearing.
Among the improvements listed above, those which have directly affected the
portion of 41KR243 within the proposed right-of-way include the construction of a
caliche gravel-surfaced road, a drainage ditch, portions of the fence, land clearing, and a
buried water line. The private caliche road traverses roughly north-south through the
proposed right-of-way dividing it into east and west areas. The latter area is bordered on
the west by existing FM 783, its eastern backslope, and the wooden fence (which runs
north-south along the crest of the backslope). This area is also divided into two portions
(north and south) by a drainage ditch that has been partially lined with concrete and an
18-inch-diameter drain pipe. The degree to which construction of the caliche road has
affected the site is treated in more detail in following sections of this report; however, it
is pertinent to note here that a surface deposit of gravel containing small quantities of
lithic artifacts is present throughout much of the southwestern area of the proposed
right-of-way and is apparently related to the road's construction. In addition,
approximately 50-55 m2 of the northern half of this area has been removed by the
construction of the drainage ditch.

Apart from these disturbances, it is also likely that at least a portion of the western
area was removed during the construction of existing FM 783 as evident from the surface
distributions of prehistoric cultural material (see below). Construction of the highway
was, in part, accomplished by grading the roadbed downward from the original terrace
surface to a point approximately 1.5 meters above the current water level of Town Creek.
The eastern wall of the road cut was subsequently graded to form a drainage ditch and
backslope. Lithic artifacts, scattered burned rock fragments, and the dispersed remains
of a hearth (Feature 2) were observed along the length of the backslope between the
terrace edge on the north and the intersection of FM 783 and the private caliche road on
the south (Fig. 4).
The three test units excavated by SDHPT personnel were located in the western
area of the proposed right-of-way. SDHPT Test Unit 1 was located 8 meters south of the
drainage ditch while SDHPTTest Unit 2 was situated 7 meters north ofthe ditch. SDHPT
Test Unit 3 was located in the southern portion of the area 13.7 meters south of SDHPT
Test Unit 1 (Fig. 4).
Surface inspection of the location by TARL during the first week of the 1989 field
work resulted in some modification of the site's estimated areal extent as it was originally
reported (Young 1988). The site is clearly limited on the north and northwest by the
terrace edge and the modern channel of Town Creek. Fragments of burned limestone
and lithic artifacts were observed eroding from the terrace edge throughout the proposed
right-of-way and to a point 21 meters northeast of the eastern limit of the right-of-way.
The portion of the site within the proposed right-of-way in this area is severely eroded
along the terrace edge and the gravel deposit underlying the early Archaic component
can be seen at or near the surface in several locations. The southern site limit is also
reasonably well defined by the surface occurrence of lithic artifacts and widely scattered
fragments of burned rock in a small erosional gully in the vicinity of the previously
mentioned liveoaks and the absence of such materials in the eastern drainage culvert of
FM 783 in the same general area.
The east and west limits of the site are problematic. Aside from the materials
observed on the highway's eastern backs lope, a few lithic artifacts were observed on
surface exposures within the easement west of the FM 783 road surface. However,
private property boundaries prohibited inspection beyond the easement and whether
these artifacts represent prehistoric occupation of this area or simply materials
redistributed by road construction is unclear. Prehistoric cultural debris including fragÂ­
ments of burned rock and debitage are also present in a diffuse scatter which extends east
from the proposed right-of-way boundary to the base of the hill (a distance of apÂ­
proximately 80 meters).
The total areal extent of the site is approximately 9600 m2 â¢ This figure is' based on
the observations given above and does not necessarily reflect the site's original size. It
is possible, if not likely, that at least some of the prehistoric debris observed along the
eastern and western peripheries represents material redistributed or transported to the
site from another location in the course of highway construction and the camp's developÂ­
ment projects. Some of the material along the eastern site limit may also have washed
from the crest of the hill. The proposed right-of-way encompasses an approximate total
of 2200 m 2â¢

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODS
The field investigation of 41KR243 was conducted with an overall crew size of six
persons during the period April 10 to May 25, 1989. A total of 81 m 2 of the site were
excavated providing a sample of approximately 3.7% of the area within the right-of-way.
A horizontal block of 58 m2 was excavated in the SDHPT Test Unit 1 vicinity, the "south
block." The south block included two 1-m2 units of SDHPT Test Unit 1 (N100/E96 and
N100/E95) which were excavated below the SDHPT final depth for stratigraphic inforÂ­
mation. A second block of 16 m2 was excavated north of the main excavation in the
SDHPT Test Unit 2 area, the "north block." In addition to the block excavations an
isolated 2-m2 unit was excavated west of the main block and north of SDHPT Test Unit 1
at NI04/E92. Two other units, 1 x 2 meters at N102/E112 and 1 m 2 at N92/E123, were
excavated, along with a shovel probe, east of the private caliche road to test for subsurface
cultural deposits in the southeastern area of the site. All of the work was accomplished
through the hand excavation of individual 1-m2 units. Some areas of the site were
stripped of overburden with power equipment after it was determined that little useful
data would be lost.
The scope of field work during the first week of investigation encompassed three
primary objectives carried out by a crew of three persons. First, a surface inspection of
the location was made in order to identify the SDHPT test units, site limits, potential
areas of excavation, and to observe the general condition of the site. The second
objective, a preliminary geomorphological assessment of the terrace, was accomplished
through the uncontrolled hand excavation of three trenches that would provide adequate
profiles for interpretation. One trench (Trench A) was excavated to a depth of 1.7 meters
below surface on the FM 783 backs lope near SDHPTTest Unit 1. The other two trenches
(Trenches B and C) were located along the terrace edge at the site's northern limit and
were excavated to 1.35 and 0.95 meters below surface respectively. A fourth profile was
scraped but not trenched on the backslope 15.5 meters north of Trench A. In addition,
the north one-half of SDHPT Test Unit 1 (NI00/E96 and NI00/E95) was deepened to
provide a more complete exposure of the natural stratigraphy of the terrace .. The soil
texture and chemistry samples were collected from the Stratigraphic Column along the
E94 grid line between N98 and NlOO (the west face of SDHPT Test Unit 1). The
excavation of units NlOO/E96 and NI00/E95 was performed in 10 cm arbitrary levels with
50% screening of all excavated fill. The test was ultimately terminated at 2.10 meters
below surface (an elevation of 97.35 meters) in the unit's northeast corner.
The third and final objective of the first week included laying out the excavation grid
and general mapping. These efforts began with the establishment of a grid system
oriented on magnetic north and aligned in such a way as to incorporate SDHPT Test
Unit 1. The north-south and east-west grid lines were established using a transit and

21

metric tape to place stakes at grid provenienced points in the areas of the site to be
investigated. As a matter of convenience, the intersection NO/EO was outside the site
boundaries to the southwest; thus, all excavated units would fall within the northeast
quadrant of the grid and thereby simplify recording procedures. Once the grid had been
established, general mapping data were gathered for the purpose of drafting a scaled
topographic map of the site. The metric data were collected using transit and stadia
distances cross-checked (randomly) with a 50-meter tape. The map was drafted on site
and supplemented with additional mapping points to ensure accuracy. All elevations for
the map, as well as the excavations, were taken from the site datum established by the
SDHPT testing crew. An arbitrary elevation of 100 meters amsl had been assigned to the
datum during testing and was also used for the current project.
All features, artifacts, and special samples were provenienced within the grid. The
features encountered during the current project (Features 3 through 7) were treated as
distinct cultural units delineated by their horizontal extent and vertically by their top and
bottom elevations. The surrounding matrix of the unit or units in which a particular
feature was encountered was removed apart from feature fill.
All cultural remains, special samples, and relevant natural features were horizonÂ­
tally provenienced according to the grid point designation of the northeast corner of the
1-m2 unit in which they were encountered. Vertical control, using a string-line, line level
and metric tape, was maintained at 2-meter horizontal intervals within the grid. The
elevation of the selected grid corner was then established from the site datum using a
transit.
Formal excavations began the second week with a crew complement of five persons;
crew size was increased to six persons in the third week and maintained at that level
through the remainder of the project.
The units comprising the south block of excavations were distributed to the north,
south and east sides of SDHPT Test Unit 1 and were south of the N107 grid line. The
area west of and adjacent to the SDHPT test unit was avoided because of the presence
of two large junipers. The units in this block were excavated to an average de~th of 55
em below surface (or, to an average elevation of 98.88 meters). The four 1-m units at
N104/E92 were excavated to an overall depth of 50 cm below surface (at elevation 98.85
meters) in three units and 60 cm below surface in the unit at NI03/E92. The units
comprising the north block of excavations were situated adjacent to the south and east
walls of SDHPT Test Unit 2 and were north of the N114 grid line. The eroded condition
of this area and the presence of large trees were determining factors in the arrangement
of the units. The average depth to which units in the northern area were excavated was
45 cm below surface (at elevation 98.91 meters).
The eastern portion of the proposed right-of-way, as previously noted, was tested
with three 1-m2 units and a shovel probe. The two I-m2 units at N102/E112 were placed
2.5 meters east of the private caliche road and excavated to 60 and 70 em below surface
in the east and west units respectively (an elevation of99.06 meters in N102/E111). The
single 1-m2 unit at N92/E123 was located 10 meters south of the unit at N102/E112 and
11.5 meters east of the private caliche road. This unit was terminated at 40 cm below

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODS / 23

surface (99.66 meters). A 50-cm2 shovel probe, located between the units at N102/El12
and N92/E123, was excavated to a depth of 75 cm below surface.
During the first three and one-half weeks of the project an evaluation of the late
period prehistoric cultural deposits was recognized as necessary. Six 2-m2 units and two
1- x 2-meter units were excavated from the surface entirely by hand during this period
(Fig. 4; Table 2). The results of these efforts led to a decision to remove the upper 30 to
35 cm of soil by mechanical means. An SDHPT "Gradall" was employed to accomplish
this in the two main blocks of investigation. An area of approximately 90 m2 was cleared
of the upper soil unit in the south block while an area of 20 m2 was removed in the north
block. The Gradall was also utilized to excavate a 1.35 meter deep soil profile pit east of
the private caliche road (Gradall Trench). All Gradall operations were closely monitored
by supervisory personnel.
Hand excavation both before and after the Gradall work proceeded in all units in
10 cm arbitrary levels using scraping techniques with shovels and trowels (Fig. 5). Bottom
level thicknesses varied between 3 and 10 cm across the site depending upon the
proximity of the natural and mechanically produced surfaces to the bottom of the early
Archaic cultural zone. Nails were placed at the floor-wall junctures in the grid corners
at 2-meter horizontal intervals on the completion of a level in order to allow positive
correlations between arbitrary levels and natural and/or cultural strata discernable in the
profiles after excavation. All of the fill removed by hand, except for soil and feature
matrix samples, was 100% screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth.
The cultural and natural contents of each level excavated were recorded on a
standardized form. The information provided on each form included horizontal and
vertical proveniences, preliminary counts and discussions of cultural materials, pertinent
observations regarding subsurface conditions and, when necessary, a plan map of the

level floor. All formal tools, cores, and trimmed or utilized flakes encountered in situ,
as well as features, were individually plotted on level plans alo n~ with their elevations.
Scattered fragments of burned limestone estimated to be 9 cm and larger were also
plotted and drawn while the relative proportions of smaller fragments were simply noted
on the level form.
Profiles were drawn for two walls of each excavation unit prior to the G radall
removal of the upper soil zone. The choice of walls to be drawn was based upon which
were considered most informative. Profiles were also drawn of each cross-sectioned
feature, as well as one wall of each trench excavated for the purposes of geomorphological
interpretation.
A photographic record of the excavations was kept using both black-and-white print
and color slide film. Photographic documentation included logged exposures of feature
overviews and details, completed unit overviews, unit wall profiles, general work shots,
and site overviews.
The soil sampling strategy employed at 41KR243 involved the recovery of one
constant volume sample from all levels of designated units, two from the early Archaic

FIELD INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODS I 25

cultural zone in all units, and one from the fill of each feature. Feature matrix samples
of equal volume were also recovered, as were samples for soil phosphate analysis. The
latter were collected from alII-meter grid points within the excavated areas using a coring
device fashioned from 2-inch-diameter schedule 40 plastic pipe.
In addition to soil and feature matrix samples, selected burned rock fragments were
recovered from each feature for the purposes of organic residue and archeomagnetic
analyses. Rock fragments taken for organic residue analysis were coded on feature plan
maps and then bagged in plastic and entered into the field inventory. The fragments
selected for archeomagnetic analysis were first enclosed in leveled, magnetic-northÂ­
oriented mold frames constructed of custom-cut 1- x 2-inch milled lumber and rubber
bindings (Fig. 6a-c). Iron-free plaster was then poured into the mold to encase the
specimen (Fig. 6d-e). Magnetic north was recorded on the exposed top of each casting
once it had hardened using a compass aligned straight-edge (Silva, Type 7NL). These
samples were also coded on feature plans. In the laboratory, cores were drilled from the
encased samples (Fig. 6f).
Charcoal and macroscopic faunal remains (other than terrestrial snails and a single
fragment of mussel shell) were nonexistent in the excavations described here. However,
terrestrial snails of several species were recovered from nearly all levels in all units and
were handled according to the procedures described below.
All cultural materials and special samples were placed in plastic and/or paper bags
on which full provenience information, date, excavator's initials, and an assigned field
inventory number were recorded. All of the artifacts and snails recovered from a given
level were placed in separate bags (one within the other) and combined under a single
field inventory number. Formal tools, trimmed flakes, and possible utilized flakes were
wrapped individually in aluminium foil and marked for exclusion from washing. The
materials were then sent, at the end of each week, to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin for processing, analysis, and cUTation.

CHAPTER 5

FINDINGS
SITE STRUCTURE

Natural

Archeologists are increasingly concerned with the geologic context of archeological
sites and are producing better results because of that concern. The geologic setting of
any archeological manifestation is of fundamental importance when considering the age,
integrity, past environment, site formational processes, and other contextual details of
those manifestations. This study of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site is concerned with the
site's geologic context at two scales ofinquiry, regional (the macro scale) and site-specific
(the meso scale). There are also micro scale implications of the geologic data generated
in both the field and laboratory.
Michael D. Blum and James T. Abbott each visited the site briefly and contributed
to the field observations incorporated into this discussion and Abbott conducted the
textural and chemical analyses reported in Appendix 1. Beyond providing important
contextual evidence for the interpretation of this site, this study is intended as a small
contribution toward better understanding of the geomorphic history of this region of the
Edwards Plateau. With this better understanding should come improved ability to
predict site locations, evaluate site integrity, and interpret site distributional patterns.
The plateau surface north of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site rises to 646 meters amsl.
The divide between the Guadalupe and Pedernales drainages is only 5.8 km up Town
Creek and its tributaries from the site. The catchment area above 41KR243, including
Town Creek, Bear Hollow, and Indian Branch, is only 18 km 2, underscoring the upland
context of this site. Town Creek is joined by its major tributary, Cow Head Hollow, only
275 meters downstream from the Camp Pearl Wheat Site. Below this confluence, the
valley is wider and straighter than it is at and above the site. Drainage patterns
throughout this region are dendridic with the steepest gradients occurring in the lowest
order tributaries. This is expressed clearly by Town Creek whose overall gradient from
source to its confluence with the Guadalupe River averages 12 mJkm. Below its conÂ­
fluence with Cow Head Hollow, Town Creek falls at an average rate of 5.6 m/km. In the
stretch near the site, the rate of fall is 8.8 mJkm and in the upper most reaches of the
catchment, it increases to 41 mJkm. This geometry produces high energy, short-term flow
at times of moderate to heavy rainfall.
Town Creek in its stretch where the Camp Pearl Wheat Site occurs is flowing on
bedrock and is generally incised into the alluvial valley floor some 4-6 meters (Fig. 7).
Adjacent to the stream are small, active flood plain areas, generally 1 to 3 meters above

the stream. Rising above the channel and flood plain are the steep scarps of the 4-6 meter
terrace. The notoriously flashy discharge of Town Creek is reflected in the coarse gravels
making up much of the stream bed and flood plain surfaces. Gravel lenses are also
commonly exposed in the eroded terrace scarp faces indicating that high energy deposiÂ­
tion is not new to this setting. In the several kilometers of Town Creek valley above and
below the site, no intermediate terraces occur between the flood plain and the 4-6 meter
surface. This is interpreted to mean that a single episode of downcutting is represented.
Although the possibility exists that other intervals of valley filling occurred and the
resultant deposits were subsequently removed, it is not considered likely that this could
have occurred without leaving any trace. In terms of geomorphic history, then, it appears
that a single cycle of valley filling and cutting is recorded by the deposits making up the
4-6 meter terrace and the present, deeply incised channel. The extent of weathering, the
inclusion of buried archeological manifestations of the early Archaic in these deposits,
and the presence of middle Archaic middens on the surface of the 4-6 meter terrace (site
41KR469) suggest an early Holocene age for the valley fill.
The episode of downcutting is also inferred to have occurred in the early Holocene.
Coarse gravel to sandy traction load and sandy to clayey suspension load is transported
by Town Creek freshets and, because the gradient is becoming less steep in the vicinity
of the site - particularly just downstream - alluviation would be expected. That late
Holocene alluvium is missing except on the very limited flood plain can only be accounted
for by the deeply incised, narrow stream channel which confines the flow, maintains the
high energy generated by the steeper gradients upstream, and favors transport over
deposition ofload. The occasional flood that overtops the 4-6 meter terrace does so only
with the upper few centimeters of its water column which is capable of suspending nothing
but clay to fine silt, the dominant materials in the deposits covering the early Archaic
component in the site. This situation suggests that stream downcutting occurred at
essentially the same time as the occupation, that is, 5 to 6 millennia ago.
The Camp Pearl Wheat Site is situated on the outside of a bend in Town Creek in
the upper meter of deposits making up the 4-6 meter terrace. On the opposite side of
the creek is a low flood plain and prograding point bar. The terrace scarp along the west
side of the site is partially obscured by vegetation and by recent slumping. It was
necessary, therefore, to work primarily from artificial exposures of the deposits (Trenches
A-C, Gradall Trench, Scraped Profile, and Stratigraphic Column).
Excavation revealed that the alluvial mass in which the site occurs (Fig. 7) is
consistent across the area of the site. It consists of stratified fluvial deposits modified by
one soil. In the restricted area of the site, six geologic zones were documented (Figs. 8
and 9). "Zone" is used here to designate any layer of earth material characterized as
distinct from adjacent layers by some particular property or content, be it depositional,
pedogenic, or cultural.
The six zones consist of alternating gravels and silty clay loams with a single soil
overprint originating at the present surface. All of the zones are calcareous. The
archeological objective at this site was the thin, early Archaic component found near the
base of the uppermost loamy zone. Most of the excavated area did not penetrate beneath
that cultural component, but deeper exposures were made in six areas of the site and from

these were recovered most of the stratigraphic data. No single profile exposed all six
zones and no connecting profiles were cut between any of the six stratigraphic profiles;
therefore, there is some uncertainty in the correlations suggested in Figure 9 particularly
in regard to the gravel deposits seen in the two trenches (B and C) on the western edge
of the site along Town Creek. These six zones are designated and described from the
base upward.

32 / FINDINGS

Zone I, the lowermost, was only seen in the Scraped Profile at the southwest edge
of the site in the FM 783 road cut. This zone consists of slightly mottled, moderate brown
(SYR3/4), silty clay loam with small carbonate nodules. The nodules are very soft and
average about 1 cm in diameter. The thickness of this zone is unknown as only its upper
38 cm was exposed. The contact with overlying Zone II is graduaL
Zone II was exposed in three locations, the Scraped Profile, Stratigraphic Column,
and Trench A. Only in the Scraped Profile was its lower boundary reached; the zone was
approximately 20 cm thick. The deposit is moderate yellowish brown (10YRS/4) calÂ­
careous gravels, with massive structure. There is some clay as well as minor amounts of
silt and sand in this zone (Figs. 8 and 10). A few burned limestone rocks were noted in
Zone II in Trench A and in the Stratigraphic Column. The bottom of Zone II was not
reached in the Stratigraphic Column, but 40 em of thickness was exposed. The gravel
deposit making up Zone II dips to the southwest, that is, down valley as well as toward
the stream. The upper contact is graduaL
Zone III, exposed in all but the Gradall Trench, is a dark brown (7.SYR4/4 to
10YR3/3) silty clay with occasional calcareous pebbles. A weak, coarse, prismatic to
columnar structure is manifest by this deposit, largely depositional in origin. There are
carbonate films, filaments, and small nodules 2-3 em in diameter present in this zone;
these are interpreted to be the product of pedogenesis. A few burned rocks as well as
chert flakes were noted in this zone in Trench A and the Stratigraphic Column; some of
the flakes were unequivocally cultural. A sample of this sediment was collected from the
approximate vertical midpoint of this deposit as exposed in the Stratigraphic Column and
subjected to radiocarbon analysis. An age estimate of 7130Â± 190 years B.P., corrected for
d 13C to 7300Â± 190 years B.P. (Tx 6S66), was obtained on contained humates (see discussion
in section on Humate Radiocarbon Date). The upper contact is abrupt and flat.
Zone IV is the major gravel deposit examined in this study. It was exposed in all
stratigraphic excavations, if it is accurately identified in Trenches Band C. In the
remaining exposures, it is seen to average between SO to 60 em in thickness and to dip
downstream and toward the present channel of Town Creek. Because of its clay, silt, and
sand content (Fig. 10), this is actually a gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown to dark
yellowish brown in color (10YRS/4 to 10YR4/4). Well rounded clasts of limestone and
chert from O.S to 8 cm in diameter make up the bulk of the deposit. There are secondary
carbonate films and filaments percipitated on well developed ped faces. No internal
bedding is visible, although crude sorting or stratification is expressed in the distribution
of clasts of different sizes. This zone contains sparse examples of burned rock and chert
flakes, some of the latter appearing to be of cultural origin. This zone is considered to
be a gravelly mud in primary depositional position with minor carbonate enrichment
resulting from illuviation. The character and geometry of this zone suggest that it may
have formed in chutes on the flood plain near the main channel of Town Creek at times
of rapid runoff. This would occur only if the bed of Town Creek were some 3 meters
higher than present. The upper boundary of Zone IV is clear. The upper surface of this
zone was reached in most of the excavated areas of the site.
Zone V is a dark brown (7.SYR3/2) loamy clay with limestone pebbles up to 2 cm
in diameter making up less than 2% of the volume of the matrix. The structure is fine to

medium blocky with filamentous carbonate percipitated on ped faces. The zone thins
from near 60 cm in thickness in the area of Gradall Trench to about 20 cm where it was
exposed in the Stratigraphic Column. Between the Stratigraphic Column and the terrace
face (Trenches B and C) it appears to be completely beveled off. This is considered to
be a fluvial deposit, the product of flooding after down cutting of the Town Creek channel
had begun. Pedogenic alteration is clearly evident in this zone. The early Archaic, Jarrell
Interval component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site resides primarily in the lower 10 to 15
cm of this zone. Its upper contact is gradual. Except in the stratigraphic trenches, this
zone was excavated under full archeological controls in all of the investigated parts of
the site.
Zone VI, the uppermost, is a dark brown to very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2 to
lOYR2/2) clay loam approximately 30 cm thick over most of the site. There are sparse
(less than 2% by volume) calcareous pebbles up to 2 em in diameter present. The
structure grades from fine/medium blocky at the base to medium granular at the top;
many rootlets are present throughout this zone. Although the matrix gives a calcareous
reaction to HCI, no films, filaments, or nodules are visible. Sparse cultural material of
undetermined age is present in this deposit over most of the site. Zone VI is beveled off,
evidently by sheet erosion, toward the terrace edge. Initially this zone was excavated
using full data recovery techniques, but as it became clear that is was not likely to produce
useful archeological information, it was mechanically stripped to facilitate excavation of
the underlying component.
The soil developed into these deposits is locally mapped as Krum Silty Clay
(Dittemore and Coburn 1986). Krum series soils are widespread in Kerr and Gillespie
counties (Dittemore and Coburn 1986; Allison et al. 1975) and tend to develop on land
forms comparable to that at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site; in the words of Dittemore and
Coburn (1986:66), "The Krum series consists of gently sloping, deep, well drained, clayey
soils that formed in thick beds of calcareous, clayey sediments in valleys on uplands."
Because such sediments are almost always of early Holocene age, soil maps could provide
a very useful and practical aid in any search for localities bearing environmental or
archeological evidence of early Holocene age. Krum is a vertic Haplustoll within the
Mollisol Order, classifications which highlight its salient characteristics of forming under
semiarid to subhumid conditions where subsurface organic material decomposes in basic
(calcium-rich) parent material.
Cultural
The excavations at 41KR243 revealed the presence of two stratified prehistoric
cultural components within Zones V and VI. The earliest of the two components consists
of a well-defined cultural layer of lithic artifacts, scattered burned rock and burned rock
features laying at the base of the Zone V; 40 to 60 cm (on average) below the surface
across the investigated areas of the site. This component rests on (in some areas) or near
(in others) the upper limit of a deposit of early Holocene gravels (Zone IV) which is
present throughout the site and which also contains small quantities of redeposited
cultural material. The earlier component is overlain by a later, ill-defined component

SITE STRUCTIJRE / 35

consisting primarily of scattered lithic artifacts mixed throughout the upper 30 to 35 cm
of natural deposits (Zone VI). The early component, based on associated temporally
diagnostic artifacts, is attributable to the early Archaic Period. Because of this factor and
its greater integrity, the earlier component is the focus of the current study.
The later component lacks clear definition and is characterized by a general, low
density occurrence of lithic artifacts mixed throughout the upper levels of the excavated
areas. The artifact assemblage related to this component consists primarily of debitage
and is represented by an average of 4 items per level, per unit and a range of 1 to 19 items
per level, per unit in the south block; an average of 10 items per level, per unit with a
range of 1 to 32 items per level, per unit in the north block; and an average of 2 items per
level in the vicinity of SDHPT Test Unit 3. In the portion of the proposed right-of-way
east of the private caliche road, artifact frequencies ranged between 1 and 10 items per
level, per unit. The frequencies of burned rock associated with this component are very
low with only a few small, scattered fragments (occurring at inconsistent elevations)
encountered in any investigated area of the site. No features associated with this
component were found in any of the excavations. Also, no diagnostic artifacts were
recovered from excavation of this component, and thus, it cannot be precisely dated.
However, a fragmentary biface (Fig. 20e), with general affinities to late Archaic forms,
was recovered from the surface of the road cut and suggests a youngest-possible-age
bracket.
Excavation of the early component was primarily in two areas of the site, the south
block near SDHPT Test Pit 1 (Fig. 11) and the north block near SDHPT Test Pit 2 (Fig.
12). The cultural layer representing the early Archaic component is defined, in all of the
investigated site areas, on the basis of the vertically consistent occurrence of burned rock
features, increase in the densities of scattered burned rock and artifacts, and increase in
the frequencies of certain associated natural elements (terrestrial snails and small
gravels).
In the west-northwestern portion of the south block of excavations, the early comÂ­
ponent is an average of 20 cm in thickness and is positioned generally between 98.84 and
99.04 meters elevation. The layer of burned rock and chert trends slightly upwards
towards the east and south where it is present between 98.90 and 99.10 meters elevation.
The range of artifact frequencies within the early component is between 1 and 23 items
per level, per unit with an average of 10 items per level, per unit; in contrast to the average
4 items per level, per unit in the later component. Of greater contrast are substantial
increases in the density of scattered burned rock and the presence of burned rock features
which were, as previously noted, only infrequently encountered in the later component
in the case of the former and not at all in that of the latter. In this area four discrete
concentrations of burned rock and an associated scatter of burned rock were encountered
at elevations ranging between 98.84 and 98.98 meters in the westernmost units and
between 98.90 and 99.04 meters along the eastern and southern limits of the block. The
early component is also distinguished vertically by significant increases in the frequencies
of terrestrial snails and small gravels. The former are represented within the component
by frequencies ranging between 50 and 207 specimens per level, per unit as compared to
the 2 to 26 specimens per level, per unit in the overlying fill. The small gravels are present

in significant quantities within the early component but are infrequent or absent in the
upper levels.
Tho I-m2 units in this area, at N100/E96 and NIOO/E95, were excavated below the
early Archaic component to a depth of 2.10 meters below surface (97.35 meters elevaÂ­
tion). The arbitrary levels which fell within the underlying gravel deposit contained a
few scattered fragments of burned rock and a range of 2 to 4 lithic artifacts (debitage
only) per level, along with numerous pieces of naturally generated chert debris and chert
gravels. With two exceptions, the levels below the gravels were devoid of materials of
definite cultural origin. The two exceptions included levels 97.55 to 97.65 and 97.75 to
97.85. The former fell within Zone II and yielded a single flake fragment, while the latter,
situated within Zone III, yielded one complete primary flake and one flake fragment.
Small quantities of apparently naturally generated chert debris were also encountered in
most of the levels below the gravel deposit.
The four burned rock features (Features 1, 3, 6, and 7) lay at an average elevation
of 98.91 meters and are comprised of dense, discrete concentrations of thermally fracÂ­
tured limestone stream cobbles which exhibit characteristics of arrangement that are
suggestive of formation in shallow basins (Figs. 4, 11, and 12; also see Feature DescripÂ­
tion section). Feature 1 was discovered during the testing operations conducted by
SDHPT personnel and is located in the southwestern corner of the south block in grid
units N99/E95 and N99/E96. Feature 3, the largest of the four, is situated approximately
4 meters northeast of Feature 1 in grid units N103/E99, NI03/EIOO, N104/E99, and
N104/E100. Features 6 and 7 are distributed to the north and northwest of Feature 3 (2.5
and 1 meters distant, respectively) in grid units NI06/E98, N106/E99, NI07/E98, and
NI07/E99 (Feature 6) and N105/E97, N105/E98, NI06/E97, and NI06/E98 (Feature 7).
A general scatter of burned rock composed of randomly clustered and individual fragÂ­
ments accompanies the features. These occur with greatest frequency in the immediate
vicinities of Features 3 and 7 and gradually decrease in density to only a few fragments
in each unit as one moves away from the features. A fifth concentration of burned rock
was encountered in the four I-m2 units directly west of Feature 3 and south of Feature 7.
This concentration was initially given the designation "Feature 5." This designation was
subsequently eliminated after continued excavation revealed a randomly dispersed acÂ­
cumulation consisting of generally smaller fragments than those comprising the other
concentrations.
Artifact frequencies within the early Archaic component in the south block are
generally low. The plan of this block (Fig. 11) illustrates the distribution of pointÂ­
provenienced artifacts which. included projectile points (2), biface fragments (2),
trimmed flakes (3), a utilized flake (1), cores (4) and core fragments (5). These items
were usually encountered between 1 and 2 meters away from the features. In general,
artifacts encountered within the early Archaic component appear to be variably disÂ­
tributed (both vertically and horizontally). There is, however, a slight tendency toward
greater densities in units situated one or more meters away from the features (Fig. 11).
Only one discrete concentration of debitage was encountered in the south block. This
concentration was located in unit N97/E98 at the southern edge of the block and consisted
of 37 flakes and flake fragments, many of which appear to have been struck from the same

-~

parent material. The artifacts were laying flat along the same general plane (98.91 to
98.93 meters) in an area approximately 25 cm in diameter. Notable exceptions to this
tendency are the two units which contained Feature 6, in which the matrix surrounding
the feature yielded 34 items in NI07/E98 and 73 items in NI07/E99.
The vertical position and dimensions of the early Archaic component in the north
block are generally consistent with those described for the south block. The component
remains an average of 20 cm in thickness although it is slightly higher (on average) in
elevation than in the south block. The vertical position of the component is generally
between 98.90 and 99.10 meters elevation.
Although the early Archaic component's vertical position and dimensions are conÂ­
sistent with those observed elsewhere, its content contrasts markedly with that of the
previously described area. Two of the most obvious differences are significantly higher
artifact frequencies and a relative paucity of burned rock. In this area of the component
the artifact frequencies average 47 items per level, per unit and range between 21 and 97
items per level, per unit as compared with an average of 10 items per level, per unit in
the south block. Only one small concentration of burned rock (Feature 4) and a few
scattered fragments of burned rock were encountered here in contrast to the four features
and associated scatter found in the south block. However, as in the south block, the early
Archaic component is also distinguished by significant increases in the frequencies of
snails and the density of small gravels. Snail frequencies increased from 2 to 25 in the
upper levels to 12 to 117 in levels within the early Archaic component while gravel
densities were similar to those in the south block excavations.
Other differences are apparent in the north block as well (Fig. 12). For example,
Feature 4, which is located in grid unit N117/E97, is smaller in overall dimension than
Features 1, 3, 6, and 7; significantly so in comparison to Features 1,3, and 7. Feature 4
is also comprised of considerably fewer individual fragments of rock than the smallest of
the previously mentioned four (Feature 6); even when several fragments of rock which
may have originally been part of Feature 4 and which now lay scattered a short distance
to the south and west are taken into account. There are also differences in the horizontal
distribution of artifactual materials. The overall distribution of debit age is again variÂ­
able; however, in contrast to the south block there is a tendency toward higher densities
in units closer to, rather than farther away from, features. This tendency can also be seen
in the location of the one small concentration of artifacts found here. This concentration,
which consisted of 7 flakes and flake fragments along with a single heat-damaged biface,
was located only 40 cm to the southeast of Feature 4 and along the same plane (98.91Â­
98.92). The concentration described for the south block excavation was situated 2.4
meters away from the nearest feature (Feature 1).
The horizontal distribution of point-provenienced artifacts, however, remained
generally consistent with distributions observed in the south block. A total of 10 pointÂ­
provenienced artifacts associated with the early Archaic component (1 projectile point,
3 biface fragments, 2 cores, 1 trimmed flake, and 3 utilized flakes) were recorded in the
north block of excavations. With the exceptions of the previously mentioned biface and
a core, these items occurred at various elevations within the early Archaic component, 1
or more meters distant from the feature. One unidentifiable dart-sized projectile point

fragment associated with the later component was also recovered from this area
(Specimen 7).
The discussion of the site's structure in the south block vicinity noted an upward
trend in elevation of the area to the east and south. This trend appears to continue across
the private caliche road into the eastern portion of the proposed right-of-way where the
greatest densities of artifacts were encountered between the elevations of 99.15 and 99.35
meters. The overall density of cultural material within the early Archaic component is
less than those observed in the two block excavations. The frequency of burned rock,
three small, widely dispersed fragments, is similar to frequencies encountered in the
southern units of the south block and the majority of the units comprising the north block.
Artifact frequencies average 7 items per level, per unit in the levels comprising the early
Archaic component which are only slightly lower than those in the south block. As with
the two previously described areas, the early Archaic component east of the private
caliche road is distinguished by substantial increases in the frequency of snails and the
density of gravels. The number of snail specimens per level rose from 8 to 50 in the upper
levels to 13 to 166 in levels within the early Archaic component. A single pointÂ­
provenienced artifact, a unifacially trimmed flake (Specimen 24), was recorded in unit
NI02{E112. The early Archaic component was not observed in the Gradall Trench.
Although several small fragments of burned rock were present within the underlying
gravels, materials of definite cultural origin were not observed in the deposits above
them.
The early Archaic component's vertical position is difficult to ascertain in SDHPT
Test Unit 3 as a result of extremely low frequencies of cultural material (Young 1988).
The early Archaic layer appears to lay between 98.95 and 99.15 meters elevation, which
correlates with levels 4 and 5 of the SDHPT testing crews' 10-cm arbitrary levels. This
assessment is based on the presence of an unrecorded quantity of burned rock and artifact
frequencies of two and six items per level for levels 4 and 5 as compared with one to three
items per level in levels 1 through 3. The frequency of snails and the density of gravels,
if encountered, were not recorded for SDHPT Test Unit 3.
Evidence of natural and cultural disturbances were observed throughout the excavaÂ­
tions. With regard to natural processes, the most abundant evidence is the relatively high
density of gravels observed within the early Archaic component (as compared to levels
above this component). These gravels were frequently encountered in small, conÂ­
centrated pockets on the downstream sides (south and west) of larger clusters of burned
rock and interspersed throughout all of the features. Features, in all instances, reflect
disturbance in that at least some component fragments of rock have been dislodged and
dispersed, again to the south and west. Direct evidence of bioturbation is preseD:t in many
of the units in the form of rodent and insect burrow stains, root stains, and the roots of
existing trees.
Modern and possibly prehistoric cultural activities have also affected the site's
condition. Possible prehistoric cultural activities which may have affected the site during
and after its formation are of a more speCUlative nature and are discussed in the
interpretive sections of the report. Most of the modern disturbances of significance, such
as land clearing and the removal of portions of the site during construction of existing

SITE STRUCTURE I 41

FM 783 and the drainage ditch, have already been addressed in the Site Description
section. Of particular interest here are the effects of construction of the private caliche
roadway. In the western portion of the proposed right-of-way the effect upon the
condition of the earlier component appears to have been minimal. The results of
excavations in units situated along the road in both excavation blocks indicated that fill
for the roadbed had been placed directly on the original surface of the terrace. This is
clearly evident in the east wall profiles of the units adjacent to the road which reflect a
sharp, well-defined contact between construction fill and the natural terrace deposits.
The differences in the general content of the fill are also obvious. The road
construction fill is characterized by a considerable amount of mottling and irregularly
distributed lenses of sand, caliche, and crushed rock resembling the nearby roadbed. The
fill also contained numerous unburned fragments of limestone, gravels, historic artifacts,
and a few prehistoric artifacts mixed throughout. In the eastern portion of the right-ofÂ­
way, construction seems to have had a slightly greater effect, primarily on the later
component. The mixture of historic and prehistoric artifacts and the presence of gravel
resembling the natural terrace deposit in the construction fill west of the road suggests
that at least a portion of it was derived from the upper deposit in the eastern area.
SUMMARY

The investigations at 41KR243 indicated the presence of two cultural components;
an earlier component attributable to the early Archaic Period and a later, ill-defined
component of unknown, but possibly late Archaic, temporal affiliation. The early ArÂ­
chaic component is represented by a distinct layer of cultural materials defined on the
basis of the vertically consistent occurrence of burned rock features and an increase in
artifact and scattered burned rock densities. The later component lacks clear definition
and is represented by a general low density scatter of lithic artifacts and a few scattered
fragments of burned rock.
The vertical position of the early Archaic component is relatively consistent
throughout the areas investigated and has a slight upward trend from the west to the south
and east. Four burned rock features (three of which are clustered in the northeastern
corner of the south block) and an associated scatter were encountered in the south block
excavations while only one much smaller feature along with a few scattered fragments of
burned rock were discovered in the north block. Artifact distributions within the early
component reflect significant differences in density among the areas investigated. They
are very low in SDHPT Test Unit 3 and the units located east of the private caliche road.
They are somewhat higher in the south block of excavations and significantly- higher in
the north block. All of the excavations exhibited evidence of disturbance, to varying
degrees, by natural processes and recent cultural activities.

42 I FINDINGS

FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS

Six features were located during the course of excavations at 41KR243, two during
the testing phase by the SDHPT and four during the mitigation phase by TARL. The
features are composed of fragments of burned limestone rock with few, if any, directly
associated artifacts. They appear to represent hearth features, utilized during occupation
of the site in the early Archaic Period.
The features are generally circular or slightly ovate in shape and exhibit some
evidence of dispersal by natural and cultural disturbances. They range in size from 0.7
to 1.6 meters in diameter, with the possible exception of Feature 2, which was exposed
on the FM 783 backslope and no data on its size are available. In profile, the majority of
the features exhibit elevational differences which suggest formation in shallow pits. The
surrounding matrix, however, appears homogeneous with no indications of pit outlines.
A concentration of scattered burned rock was encountered in the area south of
Feature 7 and west of Feature 3. This concentration was originally designated as Feature
5, however, this designation was later eliminated upon further excavation of the area.
The concentration was found to contain generally smaller burned rocks which assumed
no particular configuration. In addition, no significant elevational differences were
observed between the central burned rock and those around the periphery. It was felt in
the field that this was just a scatter of burned rocks representing disposal from hearths.
However, later laboratory analysis indicating in situ heating and cooling of a burned rock
brings this interpretation into question.
Two archeomagnetic and three organic residue samples were processed from the
large burned rock scatter west of Feature 3 and south of Feature 7. The organic residues,
of course, say nothing about the way in which the scatter developed but do include two
pieces with both plant and animal residues and one with only animal residues. These
could have been formerly associated with any of the more organized features nearby or
have experienced some other use history. The two archeomagnetic determinations, on
the other hand are informative. Rock 52 had been heated to a high degree (ca. 600Â°C),
cooled in one position, and then moved before coming to rest about 1/2 meter south of
the southern edge of Feature 7. This would agree with the field inference of a discard
scatter. However, rock 53 cooled from ca. 550Â°C in the position in which we documented
it. It was situated only about 25 cm from stone 52 and nothing about its position or
association suggested an organized hearth at that location (the east central part of Unit
NI04/E97 [Fig.11]). However, it is an area where burned rocks are fairly dense and a
partly disturbed hearth may be represented by these data. More archeomagnetic samples
would be needed to improve our ability to interpret the scatter of burned ro<;ks in this
area, but these were not collected.
Typically, the features are interspersed with small, alluvial gravels occurring at all
elevations. These gravels are often concentrated into small pockets in the interior and
around the exterior of the features, especially in the downslope direction.

FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS / 43

Constant volume matrix samples and feature fill samples were taken at each feature
location. The features were mapped and cross-sectioned where possible. Additional
burned rock samples were isolated for archeomagnetic and organic residue analyses.
Feature 1
Feature 1 was discovered and exposed in the southern portion of SDHPT Test Unit
1 (N99/E95 and N99/E96) during the SDHPT testing phase of 41KR243. The excavated
feature surface was located at the bottom of level 5 at an elevation of 98.93 to 98.95
meters, however, the burned rocks within the feature were lying at elevations ranging
from 98.85 to 98.97 meters. At the close of SDHPT work, Feature 1 was covered with
black plastic and the test unit backfilled. The 1989 effort by TARL included re-exposing
this feature, documenting it, and sampling it for burned rock analyses.
The feature was a dense cluster of burned limestone rocks forming an elongated
circular pattern approximately 130 cm in diameter at its widest point. The rocks were
angular and varied in size from 2 to 10 cm 3. Many of the burned rocks were lying on top
of one another and appear to have been cracked in situ, particularly towards the central
portion of the feature. They were tilted at varying angles in different directions, indicatÂ­
ing an irregular ground surface or disturbed condition.
North-south and east-west cross sections were cut through Feature 1, intersecting
at the densest concentration of burned rock within the feature. No visible difference in
the soil matrix was observed at the level of the burned rock; the matrix appeared to be a
homogeneous brown silty clay loam interspersed with 0.5 to 2.0 cm3 sized unburned
alluvial gravels. However, bottom elevations of the burned rock within the central area
of the feature were consistently deeper (as much as 12 cm) than those located on the
periphery, possibly indicating placement of the rock into a shallow pit.
Much of the feature matrix had been removed during the SDHPT testing phase,
making it difficult to ascertain the presence of gravel pockets within the feature. During
further exploration of the feature, however, several small concentrations of gravel were
noted at the same elevations as the feature rocks. The concentrations were particularly
dense within the remaining feature matrix and in the downslope direction outside of the
feature, suggesting that it may have been washed during stream flooding.
No artifacts were mapped in direct association with the feature; the feature level
did, however, contain 15 pieces of chert debitage. SDHPT testing results reported no
associated bone, charcoal, or shell (Young 1988).
Five stones were collected from Feature 1, two for archeomagnetic and' three for
organic residue analyses. The two archeomagnetic samples (Fig. 13) were determined to
have been heated to moderate temperatures (between 350Â°C and 400Â°C) and to have
cooled in place. At this writing, only one burned rock specimen has been submitted for
organic residue analysis. It retained a mixture of plant and animal lipid residues;
unfortunately, the three organic residue samples were combined (lot 604) at some phase
in this project, and it is no longer possible to say which of the three rocks was analyzed.

Feature 2
Feature 2 consisted of seven burned limestone rocks lying on the surface of the
eastern backslope of FM 783. It was recorded during the testing phase of 41KR243 by
SDHPT personnel. The rocks were lying at the same general elevation and were

contained within a 60-cm area. All of the rocks were angular in shape and ranged in size
from 2 to 4 cm3.
Further investigation of this feature included a hand-excavated trench, dug to the
same elevation as the exposed rock. The trench was 50 em deep with a horizontal area
of approximately I-m 2 at the base. A single burned limestone fragment was located at
the edge of the backslope near the bottom of the trench. No additional cultural material
was exposed in this excavation and no organic-physical samples were collected.
Feature 3

Feature 3 (Figs. 14a and 15), the largest of excavated features at 41KR243, was a
circular, densely-packed accumulation of burned limestone rocks. The feature was
within six adjacent I-m2 units; N104/E100, N104/E99, N103/EI00, N103/E99,
N102!EIOO, and N102/E99. It was located northeast of Feature 1 and southeast of
Features 6 and 7.
Many of the rocks found at the lowest elevations and around the periphery of the
feature were of a much larger size than those contained within Features 1, 2, 4, and 6.
Generally, the rocks varied in size from 5 to 7 cm3, with the smallest being 2 cm3 and the
largest 13 cm3. They appear well-fired and exhibited evidence of spalling in situ. The
larger rocks along the southern and eastern edges were inclined at an angle towards the
center of the feature.
As many as four layers of rock were visible in portions of the feature, at bottom
elevations of 98.84 to 99.04 meters. The deepest rocks were found in the central area of
the feature; the peripheral rocks, while generally larger in size, were at bottom elevations
of up to 15 cm higher. The angle of incline of the outer rocks and the depth of the inner
rocks suggests that the feature was contained within a shallow basin or pit. An examinaÂ­
tion of the feature matrix in cross section, however, revealed no visible pit outline or
discernible difference in the soil, such as staining or compaction.
Alluvial gravels (0.5 to 2.0 cm3) were located throughout the feature matrix. Small
pockets of these gravels had been formed interstitially among the burned rocks. The
exterior matrix of the feature also contained gravels; downslope of the feature and around
isolated burned rocks. The presence of gravel within the feature, the dispersed condition
of the rock and the varying inclines of the peripheral rocks suggests that the feature was
disturbed during a period(s) of flooding or by other natural processes. The lack of any
intact organic remains within the feature or evidence of staining or burning within the
matrix may support this hypothesis. However, it is also clear that the majority of the
burned rocks are still generally in place because the feature is well organized and adjacent
fragments of some rocks refit.
Associated artifacts consisted of a large (12 cm in length) split chert cobble which
had been spalled longitudinally into three fragments. No diagnostic artifacts were
excavated in direct association with the feature, although its general elevation places it
at the same level as the dart points located in other units across the site.

Twelve burned rocks were collected fro m this feature for detailed study; the compass
orientations of four were documented fo r archeomagnetic analysis and eight others were
designated for organic residue analysis. All four of the archeomagnetic pieces were
processed and to date, organic residues have been analyzed for three pieces. The results
show that the rocks 'had been heated to between 500Â°C and 600Â°C. Specimen 48 (Fig. 15)
cooled in place from ca. 500Â°C; specimen 49, which rested on top of the fe ature was heated
to greater than 550Â°C, cooled, and was subsequently moved. Stones 50 and 51, which lay
near the perimeter of the feature, experienced more complex heating/cooling histories.
These two stones show contrasting magnetic orientations for two temperature ranges.

Stone 50 was evidently heated to ca. 550Â°C, cooled to ca. 250-300Â°C, was moved, and then
completed it cooling in its recorded position. Similarly, stone 51 was evidently heated to
ca 600Â°C, cooled to ca. 350-400Â°C, was moved and then cooled in its recorded position.
An alternative interpretation that would explain the data would be that these two stones
were used in this or some other hearth, heated to the 550-600Â°C range, cooled completely,
were moved to their recorded position and reheated to ca. 250-400Â°C. We favor the first
interpretation because of the evidence that stones 48 and 49 in this feature were heated
to 500Â°C or more.
Organic residues were analyzed for three specimens along the southeast perimeter
of this feature (Fig. 15). Stone 608 retained a mixed residue derived from plant as well
as animal material; stone 610 had evidence of either the same mixture or just animal
residue. Stone 607 had only animal residues remaining.
Feature 4
Feature 4 (Figs. 14b and 16) was a small, circular concentration of burned limestone
rocks. The nucleus of the concentration was approximately 55 em in diameter with
possibly associated burned rocks within 65 em of the center of the feature. The major
portion of the feature was situated in unit N117/E97 with a possibly associated burned
rock in N116/E96.
The central portion of the feature consisted of 14 pieces of burned, angular limeÂ­
stone and 2 small pieces of burned gravel ranging in size from 2 to 7.5 cm3. Several of
the rocks, particularly along the western edge of the feature, were inclined downward at
an angle towards the nucleus of the cluster.
Elevations taken from the bottom of the rocks fell within the range of 98.91 to 98.93
meters, placing Feature 4 at the same general elevation as the other excavated features
within the site. The feature was located in the northern portion of the excavated site area
and was separated from the southern area by a modern drainpipe and drainage ditch.
A large (6 em diameter) chert secondary flake was located 10 em to the southwest
of the feature at an elevation of 98.92 meters. Two additional flakes were located in the
northwestern corner of unit N1171E97 within 25 em of Feature 4 at elevations of 98.89
and 98.95 meters. A thin, heat-fractured biface was located in the northwestern corner
of unit N116/E98 at a distance of approximately 50 em to the southeast of the feature.
This biface was lying flat at an elevation of 98.93 meters within a 30-cm2 area in which
seven chert flakes were located at an elevation of 98.92 meters.
The feature appeared to have been disturbed by water movement judging by the
presence of small, unburned gravels within the feature matrix. Small clusters of gravels
were also located adjacent to outlying burned rocks. These burned rocks may have been
displaced from the centra] portion of the feature during an episode of flooding. They
were generally lying in a downslope position from the main feature area.

Bottom elevations taken on the rocks were generally deeper (98.88 to 98.91 meters)
towards the center of the feature; as opposed to the elevations on the exterior rocks,
which range from 98.91 to 98.97 meters. These elevations may indicate that the feature
was constructed in a shallow pit. Similar elevations taken from the other features place
Feature 6 at the same general level.
Small alluvial gravels were located within the feature matrix and in the surrounding
exterior area. The majority of the gravels were concentrated to the west and southwest
of the feature. This pattern of gravel distribution is similar to that observed during
excavation of the other features.
A cluster of three large (3 cm2 ) chert flakes was recorded 15 em to the southeast of
Feature 6 at an elevation of 98.95 meters. No other artifacts were located in direct
association with the feature, however, 143 pieces of chert debitage were recovered from
the feature level within the four adjacent units.
Six burned rocks from this feature were analyzed for organic residues, and satisfacÂ­
tory results obtained on five of them. Four stones along the northern perimeter of the
feature (624, 622, 627, 628; see Fig. 17) retained residues derived from animal matter, a
large slab (629) near the southwestern edge of the feature had both plant and animal
residues, and a stone (626) at the northern edge of the feature had insufficient residue
for confident interpretation.
The two stones sampled for archeomagnetic properties yielded an interesting conÂ­
trast in results. Stone 42 showed evidence of having only been heated to ca. 350-400DC
whereas stone 43 had been heated to above 500DC; both cooled in place.
Feature 7

Feature 7 (Figs. 14d and 18) was a large, tightly-clustered accumulation of burned
limestone rocks with a diameter of 1.6 meters at its long axis. The majority of the feature
was within two adjacent 1-m2 units; N105JE98 and N105JE97 with a few of the rocks
extending into N106/E98 and N106/E97. It was located in the south block excavation of
the site; north of Feature 1, southwest of Feature 6, and northwest of Feature 3.
The rocks were generally angular in shape and of a large size comparable to those
contained within Feature 3. They appeared well-fired with many exhibiting associated
heat spalled fragments; one rock in particular possessed 14 smaller spaUed fragments.
The majority of the rocks varied in size from 6 to 11 cm 3 with a few ranging between 2 to
12 cm3 .
Within the central area of the feature, three layers of rock were present at elevations
between 98.81 to 98.92 meters. The peripheral rocks varied in elevation from 98.87 to
98.97 meters; the deepest being in the northwest area of the feature. The gradation in
depths of burned rock in a cross section on the long axis of the feature (shallow-deepÂ­
shallow) may support the hypothesis that the feature was constructed in a shallow pit.

Alluvial gravels were found mixed in the feature matrix at all depths. These gravels
were present as well in the external matrix, forming small clusters downslope of the rocks.
This finding is consistent with that observed in the excavation of the other features.
No directly associated diagnostic artifacts were discovered in the excavation of this
feature. The general elevation of the feature, however, placed it in association with other
features and artifacts located within the site area. The surrounding matrix, in the feature
level, did contain 65 pieces of chert debitage.
This feature produced the most consistent results in the organic and physical
analyses. Four stones (44-47) were sampled and analyzed for archeomagnetic properties
(Fig. 18). All were heated to ca. 500Â°C or hotter and all cooled in place. Organic residues
were present on burned rock 635, a flat slab near the southwest edge of the feature, but

not in sufficient concentration for reliable identification. Two pieces analyzed for orÂ­
ganic residues (632 and 636) both revealed the presence of animal products.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

Descriptions of the artifacts from 41KR243 are primarily arranged by material types.
The majority of artifacts recovered were lithic, while a few artifacts were of glass and
metal. The lithic artifacts are further subdivided into the morphological categories of
projectile points, bifaces, modified flakes, and debitage. Within the morphological
categories, modified specimens are described individually.
Lithic Artifacts

A total of 35 modified lithic artifacts and artifact fragments was recovered during
the SDHPT testing and TARL mitigation phases at 41KR243. Included within this group
are 7 projectile points and projectile point fragments, 16 biface and biface fragments, and
12 modified flakes and flake fragments. Each specimen is described giving morphologiÂ­
cal characteristics, provenience information, and metric data where appropriate.
PROJECTILE POINTS AND PROJECTILE POINT FRAGMENTS

A total of seven projectile points and projectile point fragments was recovered from
41KR243. Five of these were found in excavated contexts; the other two were surface
finds. Most of the specimens appear to be dart point types associated with the early
Archaic, Jarrell Interval in Central Texas.
Specimen 1. Martindale Dart Point

This nearly complete specimen is missing a small portion of the distal tip, one barb
and the tip of the other, and a 10-mm long section of the blade edge (Fig. 19a). The
damage along the blade edge occurred during excavation but it is uncertain when the
small breaks occurred on the tip and the barbs. Except for these breaks, the overall
pristine condition of the point suggests that it may have been freshly flaked and never
used when it came to rest in the position in which it was found. In particular, the edges
are exceptionally sharp and retain small scalar flakes that are partially detached, a
condition often noted on freshly knapped experimental bifaces.
It possesses a triangular blade with straight lateral edges. The shoulders are strong
and the existing barb is relatively short, less than 10 mm (Table 3). The specimen is
corner-notched and possesses an expanding stem. The base is bifurcated; it is formed by
two convex curves which give the base a distinctive "fishtail" appearance. One face is
patinated and the specimen appears unburned. It is made from a mottled red-tan chert

which is semitranslucent. Provenience: SDHPT Test Unit 2; elevation: 99.05-99.15
meters. Time period: early Archaic, Jarrell "Phase" (Suhm et al. 1954; Weir 1976; Prewitt
1981; Turner and Hester 1985).
Specimen 2. Martindale Dart Point
This nearly complete specimen is missing the distal tip, a small portion of one lateral
edge, small portions of the barbs and both terminal ends of the stem (Fig. 19b; Table 3).
The blade possesses a triangular outline with slightly convex lateral edges. An area of the
blade edge near the distal end has been broken and retouched. The specimen is strongly
shouldered with barbs formed by corner-notching. Animal lipid residue was identified
on this specimen.
The stem is expanding with the terminal ends of the basal flutes missing. The base
has a distinctive "fishtail" appearance formed by the juncture of two convex basal curves.
The specimen is made from gray chert which is unpatinated. One face possesses a large
potlid scar which suggests that the specimen had been exposed to heat. Provenience:
N102/E96; elevation: 98.91 meters. Time period: early Archaic, Jarrell "Phase" (Suhm
et al. 1954; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985).
Specimen 3. Martindale Dart Point Fragment
This specimen is a proximal fragment missing both barbs and a portion of the stem
(Fig. 19c; Table 3). The existing blade section appears triangular with straight lateral
edges. It is heavily patinated on one face with the opposing face exhibiting multiple hinge
fractures along the breakage plane of the blade.
The specimen is corner-notched with an expanding stem. The stem is bifurcated
with a notched base formed by the juncture of two convex basal edges. It is made from
gray-white mottled chert which appears unburned. Provenience: FM 783 backslope in
the vicinity of SDHPT Test Unit 1; elevation: surface. Time period: edarly Archaic,
Jarrell "Phase" (Suhm et al. 1954; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985).
Specimen 4. Uvalde Dart Point
This specimen is nearly complete, missing only one barb and a small portion of the
distal tip (Fig. 19d; Table 3). It has a triangular blade with straight lateral edges. The
existing barb is sharply pointed and thin. This specimen is deeply corner-notched with
an expanding stem. The stem is bifurcated forming a concave, "half-moon" shaped base.
It is made from tan semitranslucent chert which appears slightly patinated and unburned.
Animal lipid traces were identified on this specimen. Provenience: N117/E100; elevaÂ­
tion: 98.97 meters. Time period: early Archaic, Jarrell "Phase" (Suhm et al. 1954; Weir
1976;.Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985).

ARTIFACTDESCRIPTIONS I 57

Specimen 5. Uvalde-like Dart Point

This nearly complete specimen is missing a small portion of the distal tip and one
shoulder (Fig. 1ge; Table 3). The blade is narrow and triangular in outline with straight
lateral edges. The shoulders are well defined and formed by side-notches.
The stem is bifurcated with a deep, round basal notch. The stem portion appears
slightly wider than the blade. The specimen is made from light tan, semitranslucent chert
which is slightly patinated and unburned. This point has affinities with the Uvalde-type
dart point suggesting that although this is not a common form, it is not a unique specimen.
Another example of this form is reported by Hester et al. (1989:Fig. If). Organic residues
on this specimen indicated animal parent materiaL Provenience: N103/E91; elevation:
98.86 meters. Time period: unknown, probably early Archaic.
Specimen 6. Bell Dart Point Fragment

This specimen is approximately 50% complete and includes a complete stem and
partial blade (Fig. 19f; Table 3). The distal end is snapped and both barbs are missing.
The blade portion is triangular and appears wide and thin.
The specimen has a deep basal notch. The stem is straight and long with parallel
edges and a slightly convex base. The base is lightly ground. It is made from brown,
semitranslucent chert which is unpatinated and unburned. Provenience: approximately
2 meters north of SDHPT Test Unit 2; elevation: surface. Time period: early Archaic
(Suhm et al. 1954; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985). Prewitt places
Martindale, Uvalde, Bell, and Andice in a single "phase" (Jarrell) in spite of stratigraphic
evidence of Bell being younger than Martindale at the Landslide site (Sorrow et al. 1967).
Specimen 7. Dart Point Fragment.

This specimen is a proximal fragment missing both barbs and a portion of the stem
(Fig. 199; Table 3). It is corner-notched with an expanding stem. The existing basal
portion is straight with a possible central concavity. The specimen is made from brown,
semitranslucent chert which appears unpatinated and unburned. Provenience:
N116/E100; elevation: 99.17-99.20 meters. Time period: unknown.
BIFACES AND BIFACE FRAGMENTS

A total of 16 bifaces and biface fragments was located at 41KR243. A single
complete and three nearly complete (partial) bifaces were recovered; the remaining
specimens consisted of distal, medial, proximal, and miscellaneous lateral fragments.
Partial bifaces are those artifacts which are more than 50% and less than 100% complete.
Biface fragments are specimens which are less than 50% complete. All of the specimens
were less than 15.0 mm in thickness and the majority appeared to be fragments offinished
tools or bifaces in the final stages of reduction.

58 I FINDINGS

Specimen 8. Complete Biface

This complete biface possesses a small amount (less than 5%) of cortex on both faces
(Fig. 20a; Table 4). It is ovate in outline with slightly convex lateral edges and base. It
is made from brown, semi translucent chert which is both unpatinated and unburned.
One lateral edge at the distal end exhibits evidence of further reduction. It appears
to be thinner and sharper than the remainder of the specimen. This biface may represent
a preform for a projectile point which was discarded or lost prior to final reduction. There
was insufficient organic residue on this specimen for identification, which is in apparent
agreement with the technologial evidence that it was never finished. Provenience:
NI02/E96; elevation: 99.02 meters.
Specimen 9. Partial Biface

This thin biface has been extensively burned, which contributed greatly to its
fragmentary appearance (Fig. 20d; Table 4). The distal end, one lateral edge, and one
face of the base are missing. In addition, portions ofthe body on both faces were removed
by"potlidding." Hinge fractures and a "square" edge suggest that this is a biface aborted
during manufacture. It had virtually no organic residue which could be the result of
burning or also reflect an artifact in an unfinished and unused state.
The specimen is made from light brown chert which has a reddened appearance from
heat. It is ovate in outline with a well-rounded base. One face is heavily patinated and
possesses the majority of potlid scars. Provenience: Nl16/E98; elevation: 98.93 meters.
Specimen 10. Partial Biface

This partial biface is missing one terminal end and a portion of a lateral edge (Table
4). It possesses cortex on one face and does not appear to be well-thinned. It is 14.8 mm
thick at the center of the specimen. The artifact is made from brown, semitranslucent
chert which is unburned and unpatinated. Provenience: N116/E100; elevation: Zone VI.
Specimen 11. Partial Biface

This partial biface is broken at the distal end and has a roughly ovate outline. It is
approximately twice as thick near the broken end as at the proximal end. The specimen
is heavily patinated on one face and slightly patina ted on the other. It is made from
gray-brown, semitranslucent chert which appears unburned. Provenience: N116/E99;
elevation: 98.95 meters.

62 / FINDINGS

MODIFIED FLAKES
A total of 12 modified flakes and flake fragments was recovered from 41KR243. The
modified flake group is divided into two categories: trimmed flakes and flake fragments
and utilized flakes and flake fragments. Trimmed flakes are those which exhibit intenÂ­
tional retouch along an edge(s). Utilized flakes exhibit areas of edge damage along an
edge(s); possibly derived from casual utilization of the flake as a tool. Provenience and
metric data are in Table 5.
Specimens 24-29. 1rimmed Flakes and Flake Fragments
Specimen 24 is a primary flake which exhibits retouch along 90% of its lateral edges
on the dorsal face (Fig. 21a; Table 5). The maximum width of retouch along any edge is
5.6 mm. The ventral face exhibits numerous potlid scars, one of which has removed the
bulb from the artifact. The specimen is made from gray-brown chert which is slightly
heat-reddened and patinated on the ventral face. Provenience: N102/E112; elevation:
99.25 meters.
Specimen 25 is a complete, trimmed secondary flake. The retouch is evident on the
dorsal face along a lateral edge toward the distal end. The retouched edge is 28.5 mm in
length with a maximum width of 9 mm. It is made from gray-tan chert which is unÂ­
patinated and unburned. Provenience: N104/E91; elevation: 99.07 meters.
Specimen 26 is an incomplete secondary flake exhibiting two areas of retouch. One
area extends along a lateral edge and the distal end for 48 mm. This area of retouch is
present on both the dorsal and ventral faces with a maximum width of 12 mm. The other
area is present on the dorsal face only, toward the proximal end. It extends for 18 mm
with a width of 8.5 mm. This specimen is made from tan chert which is unpatinated and
unburned. Provenience: NI06/E99; elevation: 98.95-99.05 meters.
Specimen 27 is a partial flake exhibiting retouch on one face. The retouch extends
along the entire fragment edge for a length of 45.5 mm. The maximum width of retouch
is 12.1 mm. The fragment is made from brown chert which is slightly patinated on one
face and unburned. Provenience: NIOO/E97; elevation: 98.93 meters.
Specimen 28 is a flake fragment missing the proximal end (Fig. 21b). Two areas of
retouch are exhibited on this artifact: one is present along the distal end, the other is
apparent near the opposite end. The retouch along the distal edge is present on both
faces for a length of 22 mm and a width of 20 mm. The other retouched edge occurs on
both faces for a length of 26.5 mm and a width of 8 mm. The fragment is made from
brown, semitranslucent chert which is unpatinated. Plant lipid residues were identified
on this artifact. Provenience: NI04/EIOO; elevation: 99.01 meters.
Specimen 29 is a flake fragment exhibiting retouch on the dorsal face along its entire
lateral edge (Fig. 21c). The extent of the retouch is 80.7 mm with a maximum width of
7.8 mm. The fragment is made from tan, semi translucent chert which is patinated on both
faces. This uniface retained plant lipid residues. Provenience: N117/E99; elevation:
98.91 meters.

Specimen 30 is a secondary flake fragment. It exhibits edge damage on both the
dorsal and ventral surfaces at the proximal end. The edge damage extends for 22.8 mm
along the edge, with a maximum width of 17.9 mm. The artifact is made from gray, opaque
chert which appears slightly patinated and unburned. Although organic residue traces
remained on this specimen, they were not identifiable. Provenience: N97/E98; elevation:
98.91 meters.
Specimen 31 is a secondary flake fragment which exhibits edge damage along a
lateral edge toward the proximal end (Fig. 21d). The area of edge damage is present on
the dorsal face along 21.5 mm ofthe edge. The artifact is made from tan, semitranslucent
chert which is slightly patinated on the ventral face and unburned. Provenience:
N116/E99; elevation: 98.93 meters.
Specimen 32 is the proximal end of a flake. It exhibits edge damage along 10.6 mm
of one lateral edge on the ventral face. It is made from brown chert and is unpatinated
and unburned. Provenience: N116/EI00; elevation: 99.07-99.17 meters.
Specimen 33 is a proximal end of a flake which exhibits edge damage along 18 mm
of a lateral edge. It is made from tan, semitranslucent chert which appears patinated on
the ventral face. Provenience: Nl18/E99; elevation: 98.94 meters.
Specimen 34 is a utilized flake fragment which exhibits edge damage along both
lateral edges toward the proximal end. The total extent of the edge damage is 41.9 mm
with a width of 2 mm and is present on both faces. The artifact is slightly patinated on

ARTIFACTDESCRIPTIONS I 65

the ventral face and is made from brown, semitranslucent chert. Provenience:
NI18/EIDD; elevation: 99.D3 meters.
Specimen 35 is a nearly complete flake missing small portions of a lateral edge (Fig.
21e). It exhibits edge damage along three edges for a total length of 72 mm and a width
of 2 mm. Most of the edge damage is apparent on the dorsal face. The flake is made
from tan, semitranslucent chert which appears patinated on the dorsal face. Minor but
uninterpretable organic residues were found on this piece. Provenience: NI18/EIOD;
elevation: 98.94 meters.
Because artifacts destined for organic residue analysis were neither washed nor
handled, their categorization was often impedded. A case in point was a large, thin flake
(lot 383) thought to have been retouched along one edge. It was analyzed and found to
retain plant lipid residues. However, it was later examined and found to have been
damaged by either a trowel or shovel during excavation and one edge mostly destroyed.
We are not able to say whether it had or had not been retouched prehistorically. The
residue results indicate that, whether retouched or not, it had been used in plant
processing of some kind.
DEBITAGE

A total of 2877 pieces of debit age was recovered during the SDHPf testing and
TARL mitigation phases at 41KR243. Included in this group are cores and core fragÂ­
ments, complete flakes, biface thinning flakes, complete chips, flake fragments, and
chunks.
Cores and Core Fragments
A total of 14 cores and core fragments and 1 modified cobble were recovered from
41KR243. The cores are divided into bidirectional, multidirectional, and unidirectional
categories. Each category is discussed separately through the use of descriptions,
provenience information, and metric data where appropriate (Table 6).
SPECIMENS 36-43. BIDIRECTIONAL CORES AND CORE FRAGMENTS
These bidirectional cores and core fragments retain from 5-70% cortex on their
surfaces. Six of the specimens have prepared platforms (Specimens 36-41), while the
remaining two (Specimens 42 and 43) have both prepared and natural platforms. Five
of the specimens are complete cores (Specimens 36-39, and 42), all of which exhibit some
patination and are unburned. Two of the core fragments (Specimens 41 and 43) are
unpatinated, while the remaining core fragment (Specimen 40) exhibits slight patination;
all are unburned.

SPECIMEN 49. UNIDIRECTIONAL CORE

A single unidirectional core was recovered from the site. It has a prepared platform
and exhibits patination on all surfaces. Its surface retains approximately 40% cortex.
There is no indication that this specimen was utilized as a tool. It is made from brown
chert. Provenience: N104/E98; elevation: 98.87 meters.
SPECIMEN 50. MODIFIED COBBLE

This cobble has been split longitudinally and has a single flake removed from one
face. It is covered with 30% cortex and patinated on one face. This specimen is made
from gray-brown chert and is unburned. Provenience: N102/E96; elevation: 98.84
meters.
Flakes and Fragments

The majority of the artifacts recovered from 41KR243 consists of unmodified flakes
and flake fragments, chips, and chunks. All of the items collected were made of chert,
most of which bears a resemblance to the chert cobbles and nodules which are presently
found along the banks of Town Creek. Thirty-three percent of the debitage from all of
the excavated levels exhibits evidence of having been burned. The frequency of burned
versus unburned material was somewhat higher in the early Archaic component.
Categories within this group are complete flakes, complete chips, biface thinning
flakes, flake fragments, and chunks. The complete flakes are further divided into primary
(100% cortex on dorsal face), secondary (between 1-99% cortex on dorsal face), and
tertiary (0% cortex on dorsal face) categories. Chips are defined as complete flakes less
than 10 mm in length. Biface thinning flakes are those that possess attributes such as
well-prepared platforms and flake scars on the dorsal surface. Flake fragments represent
incomplete pieces, including distal, medial, proximal, and lateral fragments. Chunks have
a thick and angular appearance and possess no flake characteristics. An inventory of
debitage by grid coordinate and elevation is in Appendix 4.
Debitage recovered from all of the levels of the south block and SDHPT Test Unit
3 consisted of: 4 primary flakes, 63 secondary flakes, 71 tertiary flakes, 53 chips, 17 biface
thinning flakes, 1357 flake fragments, and 170 chunks.
Absolute frequencies of debitage were somewhat higher within the early Archaic
component (98.84-99.10 meters elevation) than in the later, ill-defined component (see

Site Structure). There was an average of 4 items of debitage per level, per unit for the
later component, and an average of 10 items per level, per unit in the early Archaic
component. The majority of the artifacts were scattered individually throughout the soil
matrix and were lying at varying angles. An exception to this was a discrete concentration
of debitage located in N97/E98 at elevations of 98.91-98.93 meters. This concentration
consisted of37 flakes and flake fragments, most of which appear to have been struck from
the same parent material. The major part of the debitage within the early Archaic
component was located in units away from those containing burned rock features, except
in the case of Feature 6 whose surrounding units contained from 36 to 73 pieces of
debitage.
Debitage recovered from all levels within the north block consisted of: 3 primary
flakes, 20 secondary flakes, 30 tertiary flakes, 19 chips, 3 biface thinning flakes, 961 flake
fragments, and 92 chunks.
Debitage frequencies within the north block were consistently higher, with an
average of 10 items of debitage per level, per unit for the later component and an average
of 47 items of debitage per level, per unit, for the early Archaic component. The ea~ly
Archaic component (98.90-99.10 meters) contained the majority of the material
recovered as was the case for the south block. In general, the debitage was found in a
scattered context throughout all of the levels in this area. One exception to this was a
small concentration located in Nl16/E98 approximately 40 cm to the southeas t of Feature
4. The concentration consisted of 4 secondary flakes and 3 flake fragments along with a
biface (Specimen 9). All of the artifacts were lying flat on the same plane at 98.91-98.93
meters of elevation.
In general, the debitage assemblage reflects activities involving all of the stages of
lithic reduction to some degree. The majority of the debitage, however, is composed of
small-sized, interior flakes and flake fragments. This may indicate that most of the lithic
tool production activities involved the final stages of reduction.
Glass and Metal Artifacts
A small number of Historic Period artifacts recovered from the surface and upperÂ­
most portion of the subsurface include glass and metal specimens. All date to the
twentieth century.
Glass artifacts consist of nine clear sherds, apparently all of soft-drink bottles. Two
sherds are from neck areas of a bottle; the remaining seven are from the body areas. Of
the latter, two have white lettering on clear glass, four have no writing, and one reads
"BIG RED" in white letters on red background.
Metal artifacts consist of two short pieces of barbed wire (barbs are short, flat,
bipointed, and wrapped around one strand of a double-strand S-twist wire), a steel
coupling, and one piece of a 3/4-inch galvanized iron pipe union.

ARCHEOMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF BURNED LIMESTONE I 69

ARCHEOMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF BURNED LIMESTONE

Americanist archeology today continues on a trend established nearly 30 years ago
of reducing the emphasis placed on chronology while increasing concern with aspects of
past human behavior. In no area of inquiry is this trend more apparent than in the
applications of chronometric techniques to other issues. We speak of "tree-ring analysis"
rather than "dendrochronology" and investigate much more than the age of tree ring
specimens (Dean 1969); thermoluminescence is employed to do more than date onceÂ­
burned objects (Collins and Fenwick 1973); and carbon as well as other isotopes are as
important in investigating paleoenvironmental conditions as they are in estimating age
(van der Merwe 1982; DeNiro 1987).
Likewise with the techniques of archeomagnetism. Theoretically, archeologists
should be able to determine several useful facts about heated materials, such as burned
rock, by analyzing them for their magnetic properties (Cheek et aI. 1980; Abbott and
Frederick 1989; Collins 1988). '~cheomagnetism" is a term coined for the specific
application of the principles of paleomagnetism to the investigation of archeological
phenomena. Initially, archeomagnetic inquiry was devoted to questions of chronology.
Most effort was toward developing regional histories of changes in the direction and
intensity of the earth's magnetic field and applying this information in estimating the ages
of archeological features that met the necessary conditions of having been heated (to a
moderate high degree), having not been dislocated since heating, and being composed
of a material (clay, usually) containing magnetic minerals. Numerous authors discuss the
particulars of applying archeomagnetism to questions of archeological chronology (EighÂ­
my 1980; Michels 1973; Aitken 1970).
Much of the archeological record of Central Texas is characterized by the presence
oflarge quantities of burned rock, most commonly limestone and occasionally sandstone.
The limestone and sandstone formations of Central Texas contain magnetic minerals in
sufficient concentrations to produce a thermoremanent magnetization upon heating and
subsequent cooling. This attribute makes these stones susceptible to archeomagnetic
techniques of investigation and potentially useful in several avenues of archeological
inquiry. No effort has been sustained to establish an archeomagnetic chronology for
Central Texas, although use of the technique has influenced regional archeological
chronologies which include parts of Texas; these are the Southwest (Corde111984), the
Southeast (Wolfman 1982), and the Southern Great Plains (Brooks 1989). There is a
need to continue to build a regional base of archeomagnetic data for chronological
applications by collecting and measuring suitable samples at every opportunity. EvenÂ­
tually, these will be useful in estimating ages of burned features independently of other
dating techniques. More immediate results can be derived in the application of arÂ­
cheomagnetic procedures to behavioral questions (Collins 1988; Collins et ai. 1988).
A remanent magnetization is a vectorial quantity, i.e., it has an intensity and a
direction. The intensity of magnetization is a function of the strength of the geomagnetic
field as well as the magnetic mineralogy of a given sample, and is a variable not often
used in archeomagnetic interpretations. The direction of magnetization is usually exÂ­
pressed in terms of declination and inclination (Fig. 22); it is this quantity that is used in

arch eo magnetic dating. Determining the direction of magnetization using carefully
oriented samples also makes it possible to establish whether a specific object has been
moved or remained in situ since the last heating event, information that has important
behavioral implications in the case of burned rocks (Collins 1988; Abbott and Frederick
1989; Cheek et al. 1980; Schmidt 1980). Thermal demagnetization data provide evidence
for the temperature to which rocks were heated, and, if discernible, the steepness of the
thermal gradient from the exterior toward the interior of a given rock specimen can be
used to infer the duration of its exposure to heat. These are idealized propositions that
encounter complicating factors when applied to specimens which likley have been subÂ­
jected to multiple heatings. None the less, the need is pressing to imp'rove our
understanding of the human behavior represented by the multitude of burned rock
manifestations in the prehistory of Central Texas.
Burned rock in the Jarrell Interval component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site occur
in well demarcated concentrations interpreted to be hearths as well as scattered on the
occupation surface in an apparently haphazard distribution. Two populations of these
burned rocks were inferred in the field: rocks that have remained in situ since last

ARCHEOMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF BURNED LIMESTONE I 71

heating/cooling and rocks that have been moved since last heating/cooling. Fifteen
specimens representing both of these populations were collected using a modification of
the standard techniques for collecting archeomagnetic samples (Eighmy 1980). In order
to record the present orientation of each collected piece of burned rock, a four-sided
wooden mold was prepared to fit each specimen (Fig. 6a). Each wooden mold was
rectangular and consisted of two pairs of 1- x 4-inch boards held together by sections of
rubber inner tube. These were placed around the specimen to be collected, oriented to
the cardinal directions (Fig. 6b), leveled (Fig. 6c), and then filled with freshly prepared
plaster of paris (Fig. 6d). The plaster of paris was allowed to fully harden (Fig. 6e) and
then the specimen number and a magnetic north arrow applied directly on the upper, flat
surface of the plaster using a permanent marker. After removal of the wooden molds,
the specimens were transported to the Paleomagnetic Laboratory of the Department of
Geological Sciences at The University ofTexas at Austin where standard-sized cores were
drilled from each specimen and analyzed (Fig. 6f).
Paleomagnetic Data and Analysis
In the laboratory, 2.5 cm cores were taken from 12 samples, and 3 samples, because
of their small size, were cut into cubes. None of the paleomagnetic samples had any
plaster of paris left on them. This is important because tests showed that the plaster is
significantly magnetized.
The magnetic remanence of the samples was measured with a cryogenic magÂ­
netometer and all samples were thermally demagnetized. The 12 cores were
demagnetized in 13 steps up to 650Â°C and the cubes were demagnetized up to 600Â°C (see
Appendix 2). Throughout the measuring procedure, the samples remained in a magnetiÂ­
cally shielded room.
Figure 23 a shows the directions of magnetization on a Schmidt equal area net. As
expected for these geologically young rocks, the natural remanent magnetization (NRM)
clusters around the theoretical dipole field direction except for the two samples, 49 and
52 (compare with Fig. 26). After thermal demagnetization to 350Â°C (TD350) only half
of the samples still cluster in this direction and after heating to 600Â°C, the directions
exhibit a nearly random distribution.
Following standard paleomagnetic procedures, the directions of magnetization were
analyzed by the use of As-Zijderveld diagrams, examples of which are shown in Figure 24.
In this diagram, the magnetic vector is projected onto the N-S-E-W plane (declination)
as well as in the Up-Down-Horizontal plane (inclination). Each point corresponds to the
end point of the magnetic vector after demagnetization. A stable component of magÂ­
netization is recognized by three or more co-linear points. The advantage of this approach
is that multiple components of magnetization can be more readily identified. Figure 25
shows the same data as Figure 24 except that for clarity, only the declination or inclination
is plotted for a given sample. Also added are straight lines which correspond to distinct
magnetic components. Samples 40 and 47 have two components and samples 39 and 50
reveal three components.

magnetization (NRM) and the directions after thermal demagnetization to 350Â°C
and 600Â°C. Solid symbols are in the lower hemisphere, open symbols in the upper.

Using this method, we can identify a low temperature component, i.e., a component
which is stable up to about 450Â°C and a high temperature component. These two
directions are shown in Figure 26. The low T components of samples 48, 49, 51, and 52,
and possibly 44, fall outside the main cluster of directions which center approximately
around the theoretical dipole field direction. Samples 42, 44, and53 are the only samples
in which the high T component, is closely the same as the low T component, and only
these three samples plot near the dipole field direction.
A rather unexpected result of the analysis is that change from component 1 to
component 2 occurs over a rather narrow temperature range centered around 450Â°C

(Fig. 27). This value closely corresponds to the temperature measured in an open
wood-burning fire place.
Sample 46 was sufficiently large to take multiple samples. The four samples contain
the same low, as well as high, T component of magnetization (Fig. 28). Their As-ZijderÂ­
veld diagrams are shown in Figure 29. Sample 46.0 is a 2.5 cm core with an original
exterior surface and samples 46.1,46.2,46.3 are 1.9 cm cubes. Sample 46.1 is the surface
sample, 46.2 the next deeper sample, followed by 46.3 which is 1.5 cm from the opposite
exterior surface. The two surface samples change their direction at about 500Â°C as
compared to 400-425Â°C for the interior samples.
Paleomagnetic Interpretation

Most of the samples contain at least two components of magnetization. The low
temperature component is the result of heating to about 450Â°C. Samples 48, 49, 51, and
52 seem to have been moved since their last heating because their directions do not fall
near the expected direction. The dispersal of the high T component implies that most
samples were not in their original geological position, i.e., they were carried to the fire

an early Holocene terrace. Samples 42, 43, and S3 seem to have been reheated to a
temperature near 600Â°C. Some samples contain a third, very low temperature component
of magnetization (e.g., samples 39 and SO, Fig. 24) which may be a viscous magnetization,
or more likely, may indicate a later reheating or movement after initial cooling to about
2S0-300Â°C.
The results from sample 46 suggest that it may be possible to determine a temperaÂ­

approximate length of time during which the sample experienced the maximum temperaÂ­

ORGANIC RESIDUE ANALYSIS

Introduction

Analysis of microscopic organic residues that have adhered to or been absorbed into
the structural matrix of archeological materials can provide information about the funcÂ­
tion of the artifact(s) in, and the subsistence strategies, of a past culture. Differential
preservation of organic materials in archeological contexts can result in the
misinterpretation of their relative importance in analyses of past cultures; however, it
has been shown that some components of organic materials can survive for thousands of
years with few or relatively minor alterations.
Lipids, the organic materials extracted and analyzed for this project are substances
that are: (1) insoluble in water; (2) soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and
ether; (3) contain long-chain hydrocarbon groups in their molecules; and (4) are present
in or derived from living organisms (Kates 1986:1). Because of the wide boundaries of
this definition, there are many different forms and types of lipids, including alcohols,
aldehydes, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, and sterols. This project concentrated on sterols
and fatty acids because they appear to provide the highest potential for identifying
taxonomic family or possibly species of the organic residues (Hilditch 1956; Marchbanks
1989; Guy Thompson, personal communication 1988).
For this analysis, 12 chipped stone tools and 18 burned rocks from the Camp Pearl
Wheat Site were submitted for lipid analysis. The chipped stone tools included 3 dart
points, 4 bifaces, 3 trimmed flakes, and 2 utilized flakes.
In addition, 3 non-culturally altered limestone rocks were analyzed to provide a
"natural background" level of different lipids for the site.
Previous Research

Although there are only a few published examples of the application of lipid analysis
to archeological questions (see Marchbanks 1989 for partial list), hundreds of articles
dealing with lipid analysis have been written in other disciplines such as food science,
biology, and medicine. Lipids, including fatty acid and sterol forms, are extensively used
in the food sciences to detect the presence of foreign fats in food products. An example
of this is to test a more expensive seed oil such as olive oil for the addition of less
expensive oils (rapeseed, corn, etc.) that increase the total volume at a reduced cost.
Lipid studies are also utilized to determine the rates at which fats deteriorate so food
rancidity can be reduced and to evaluate food preservation techniques such as the

ORGANIC RESIDUEANALYSIS I 79

reliability of added antioxidants. In medical and nutritional studies, lipid research is used
to determine the relationships (if any) between lipids and various diseases and other
biological problems.
Fatty acids, one form of lipid, have been investigated from a taxonomic viewpoint
since they were first studied in the nineteenth century. Hilditch (1934; Hamilton and
Bhati 1987:109) proposed that fats could be utilized for a chemically based taxonomy of
plants, and by 1956 he had begun to show that the fatty acid compositions could be useful
(Hilditch 1956; Hamilton and Bhati 1987:109-110). However, in 1963, Shorland (1963;
Hamilton and Bhati 1987:109) wrote:
That although the data on the types and distributions of fatty acids do not
provide an unequivocal guide to the classification of plants, many correlaÂ­
tions of taxonomic significance have been apparent in spite of the small
number of species examined up to now.
Even if fatty acids do not provide an "unequivocal guide" to plant (or animal)
classification, many characteristic values and identifications can be obtained and some
kinds of fatty acids are characteristic of specific parent material sources.
Sterols are another type of lipid considered in this report. These compounds are
widely distributed in animals (zoo sterols) and plants (phytosterols), but have fairly
diagnostic patterns among the different plant and animal classes, and sometimes are
species specific. One of the major advantages of sterol analysis is the ease of separating
plant and animal residues. Other than cholesterol (a major component in animals and
minor in plants), there are no major, and extremely few minor, sterols that are present
in both plants and animals. This means that if the artifact was used to store or process
several parent materials, it is easy to divide the residues into the two groups - plant and
animal. However, the amount of sterols in plants and animals is substantially less than
that of fatty acids, which severely hampered their analysis for these samples.
Concepts

The nomenclature of the fatty acids reflects their structure, identifying both the
length of the carbon chain and the number of double bonds within it. For example, the
fatty acid C18:0 has 18 carbons within its chain and no double bonds, while C18:3 has 18
carbons and 3 double bonds. They are traditionally grouped into 3 sets: (1) saturated
fatty acids; (2) monounsaturated fatty acids; and (3) polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds within their carbon chains (e.g., C12:0, C14:0,
C16:0), monunsaturated fatty acids have one double bond (e.g., C16: 1, CI8:1, C20: 1), and
polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds (e.g., CI8:2, C18:3, C20:2).
In general, animal fats tend to have a high percentage of saturated relative to
polyunsaturated fatty acids while plants have the opposite pattern (Fig. 30). Therefore,
calculating the percent of saturated fatty acids (%S) can help characterize the parent
material of the residue on archeological samples. The higher the %S value, the more
likely it is that the residue resulted from faunal parent material(s). The lower %S values,
on the other hand, are characteristic of vegetal parent materials.

Separation by percent of fatty acids (%5) and %C18.3 of modern plants and

animals.

However, limited experimentation (Morgen et al. 1973; Rottlander 1985;
Marchbanks 1989) on the degradation of fatty acids over time indicates that the total
amount of fats present decreases and that different fatty acids change at different rates.
These alterations are important since they affect the %5 calculation. In order to decrease
these effects, the saturated fatty acids that substantially alter over time (C16:0, C18:0,
and C20:0) have been excluded from the calculations of the saturated fatty acid percentÂ­
ages used in this analysis (C12:0 and C14:0 are utilized). Unfortunately, the
polyunsaturated fatty acid C18:2, which decreases through time, cannot be left out of the
calculation since it is a predominate fatty acid found in most plants; C18:2 and C18:3 are
the two polyunsaturated fatty acids used in the %5 calculation presented here. Because
C18:2 is used, a shift to higher %5 values is expected in the archeological samples than
in the comparable modern ones. In addition, since monounsaturated fatty acids have high
nondiagnostic concentrations in both plants and animals, they are not considered in the
%5 calculation (Marchbanks 1989; Marchbanks and Quigg 1989).
.
In addition to interpreting the characteristic %5 value, the lipids within the sample
were compared to modern reference collections. This can enable a closer approximation
of what the parent material(s) may have been, and can lead to the positive identification
of the few plants (e.g., coconut) that have high saturated fatty acid levels. It should be
noted, however, that only the major fatty acids present onlin the artifacts are given in the
data (Appendix 3).

ORGANIC RESIDUE ANALYSIS I 81

Methods

The artifacts in this project were processed in two different ways. The burned rocks
had approximately 1 mm of the outer surface ground off with a Dremel drill using a
cleaned tungsten steel bit; this part of the sample was discarded to reduce potential
contamination and degradation factors. An additional 1 to 26 g (depending on the
sample) was then removed for analysis. The chipped stone tools were not ground, but
rather were cleaned with sterile laboratory tissues prior to extraction of the lipids. Sterile
surgeon's gloves were used to handle all samples.
The lipids, both fatty acids and sterols, were extracted using either a Soxhlet
extractor (for the ground up burned rocks) or by soaking the artifact in a covered glass
beaker (for the chipped stone tools). The extracted fatty acids were converted to their
methyl ester form and the sterols separated from the other lipids using thin-layer
chromatography (see Marchbanks 1989 for complete details of the methods). ApÂ­
proximately 0.5 microliter of the sample was injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) with
a 25 meter, 0.25 micron ID capillary column for separation of the different organic
compounds. In addition, two of the samples were analyzed by a gas chromatograph/mass
spectrometer (GC/MS) which not only separates the different compounds, but also
provides their mass spectra which can be used to identify them positively.
It is useful to know that the extract samples can be stored for a period of time. To
do so requires replacing oxygen in the sample vial with nitrogen and storing the vial at
-20"C. This should insure sample quality for at least one year.

Results
The three limestone rock samples tested to provide a natural "background level"
for the site had Total Areas (area under the curves of the lipid peaks which is related to
the concentration and amount of lipids present) of 359, 214, and 278 with no sterols
present. In order for the organic residues to be considered significant, the Total Areas
had to be at least 1000 for the burned rock and 650 for the chipped stone tools (the latter
category needed a lower value because very little material was still adhering to them).
Eight of the samples did not have organic residue concentrations above the natural
background level, and as such, were not considered further in the analysis. These artifacts
are: (1) lot 184: biface; (2) lot 229: biface; (3) lot 392: biface; (4) lot 44: flake; (5) lot 423:
flake; (6) lot 613: burned rock; (7) lot 626: burned rock; and (8) lot 631: burned rock.
ARTIFACT TYPES

Dart Points

All three dart points had high fatty acid %S values (76.20, 73.43, and 100 percent)
indicating that the parent materials of the organic residues are faunal. There were also

82 I FINDINGS

a number of low-weight fatty acids present that occur naturally in modern fauna. The
interpretation of a faunal parent material is further supported on Lot 186, (Specimen 2)
by the presence of a large cholesterol peak and no sterols that are characteristic of vegetal
materials. In addition, there were minor traces of cholesterol on both of the other dart
points (Lot 419, Specimen 4 and Lot 228, Specimen 5). Species identification of these
residues was not possible due to the lack of diagnostic fatty acids or sterols.
Bifaces

Only one of the four bifaces analyzed, Lot 331 (Specimen 16), had significant
amounts of organic residues on it. both the presence of several low-weight fatty acids
and a high %S value of 81.63% indicate that the residue from faunal parent material.
The presence of a small cholesterol peak also supports faunal parent material. Although
not enough diagnostic lipids are present for positive identification, the fatty acid pattern
present on this biface are similar to modern deer.
1i-immed Flakes

Unlike the dart points and biface, the trimmed flakes had low %S values (26.12,
29.27, and 22.43%) and were utilized predominantly for processing plant material. Lot
383 had a good amount of residues present with a large percentage (9.35%) of CI8:3,
which is found almost exclusively in plants. The sterol analysis also supported plant
processing for these artifacts. Lot 315 (Specimen 28) had trace amounts of sitosterol
present. Lot 383 had a large sitosterol peak and traces of several other sterols associated
with floral material; unfortunately, the concentrations of these other sterols were not
high enough to allow identification of the residues' parent material.
Burned Rocks

Unlike the burned rock analyzed for the Justiceburg Reservoir Project (Marchbanks
and Quigg 1989), most of the organic residues preserved within the structural matrix of
these samples were derived from faunal parent materials. The %S values ranged from
63.22 to 92.17%, indicating that organics to which the burned rocks were exposed ranged
from a mixture of plants and animals to almost strictly animal.
Although the burned rocks were from different hearth features, feature numbers
are not evaluated with respect to the results of the residue analysis within this section
(see Featrure Descriptions section for such evaluations). To help incorporate the results
of the burned rock analyses, they will be discussed in groups based on the %S value. As
such all burned rocks with %S values between 60% and 69.9% will be in one group,
70.0-79.9% in another, etc.
60-69.9 %S. Five burned rock samples had %S values between 60 and 70 percent.
The %S value of lot 608 (in Feature 3), 68.20, resulted from a mixture of both plant and
animal residues. This interpretation is confirmed by several low-weight fatty acids, a high

ORGANIC RESIDUE ANALYSIS / 83

percentage of C18:3, and the presence of cholesterol, sitosterol, and traces of 3 other
unidentified sterols. Lot 610 (in Feature 3) had a %S value of 67.23% indicating either
a mixture of plant and animal residues or just animal. The presence of several unidenÂ­
tified low-weight fatty acids and the low percentage of C18:2 and C18:3, in addition to
the presence of cholesterol and no plant sterols, suggest that this residue results from an
animal parent material. The %S value oflot 616 ("Feature 5"),63.22%, resulted from a
combination of both plant and animal parent materials. This interpretation is supported,
like lot 608, by the presence of some low-weight fatty acids, C18:3, and the presence of
cholesterol, sitosterol, and three other plant sterols. Unfortunately, not enough diagnosÂ­
tic sterols were present to identify the vegetal parent materials. The residue in lot 622
(in Feature 6) with a %S value of69.17%, came from faunal parent materials. Inaddition,
the fatty acid pattern of the residues was extremely similar to modern deer. The only
sterol present was cholesterol which, when combined with the low-weight fatty acids,
supports the interpretation that this residue resulted from faunal parent materials. The
final sample in this group, lot 635 (in Feature 7), had a %S value of 63.43; however,
although a trace amount of cholesterol was present, there was not really enough material
in this ample for detailed interpretation.
70-79.9 %S. Although there were seven burned rock samples with %S values in this
range, they can be subdivided into two groups. The first group contained burned rock
samples lot 617 "Feature 5" (75.43 %S), lot 628, Feature 6 (71.99 %S), lot 624, Feature
6 (70.80 %S), and lot 623, Feature 7 (79.78 %S). Both the fatty acid pattern and the
sterols present in these samples were very similar to each other, indicating that they
derived from the same parent material. Although the parent material cannot be posiÂ­
tively identified, the presence of several low-weight fatty acids, lack of C18:3, and
presence of cholesterol all support the interpretation that these residues resulted from
faunal sources. The second group, Lot 629, Feature 6 (73.20 %S) and lot 619, "Feature
5" (79.89 %S) was different from the first group in that there were also some floral
residues present. This interpretation, although the samples resulted predominantly from
faunal parent material, is supported by the presence of C18:3 and some traces of sitosterol
in addition to the cholesterol. Lot 604, Feature 1 (75.78 %S) was different from the other
samples. This sample had 20% Area of C12:0, which is not characteristic of faunal
residues, as well as the presence of C18:3 and sitosterol suggesting a vegetal parent
material. A small amount of cholesterol and some low-weight fatty acids further indicate
a mixture of plant and animal parent materials.
80.0-89.9 %S. Two burned rock samples had %S values between 80 and 90 percent.
The %S value of lot 607 (Feature 3), 87.67, resulted from animal residues. This interÂ­
pretation is confirmed by the presence of several low-weight fatty acids, lack of C18:3,
and a large peak of cholesterol. In contrast, lot 627, Feature 6 (84.55 %S) 'had a high
concentration of C12:0 (approximately 20%). which is not characteristic of faunal
residues, and with the presence of C18:3 and sitosterol support the interpretation of a
vegetal parent material. There is, however, a small amount of cholesterol and some
low-weight fatty acids present indicating that the residue results from a mixture of plant
and animal parent materials. Unfortunately, the modern comparative collection currentÂ­
ly does not have a match for this sample.

84/ FINDINGS

90-100 %S. One burned rock had %S values between 90-100 percent. This sample
636 in Feature 7), resulted from faunal parent material. This interpretation is supported
by the presence of low-weight fatty acids and the lack of C18:3 in the sample. In addition,
lot 636 had cholesterol and no other plant sterols present.
Conclusions
Although some of the burned rocks and one tool (trimmed flake Lot 383) have fairly
significant quantities of residues on them, overall the amount is low. One possible
explanation for the low quantities of organic residues, as reflected by the Total Areas, is
that this site may have been occupied for only a very short time; hence the artifacts and
burned rocks may not have had a lengthy exposure to man-induced lipid concentrations.
The lipids present are fairly well preserved with only minor degradation, indicating poor
preservation is an unlikely explanation for the low quantities. As well, the predominance
of faunal residues in the burned rocks suggests processing of more meat than vegetal
materials. On the other hand, these patterns could be just a reflection of the cooking
technology in which meat is cooked such that it, and not the vegetables, come in contact
with the rocks.
Nonetheless, the chipped stone artifacts also had substantially less organic residues
on them than found on material from sites analyzed previously, suggesting that they
probably underwent short-term, low intensity usage, which would be expected at a
short-term occupation site.
Further implications of these results are elaborated within the Feature Description
and Artifact Description sections of this chapter.
HUMATE RADIOCARBON DATE

A single radiocarbon determination (Tx 6566: 7130Â±190 years B.P., corrected for

a13C to 7300Â± 190 years B.P.) was made in connection with this investigation of the Camp
Pearl Wheat Site. This determination was based on a sample of natural sediment rather
than on one of the more common kinds of archeological sample consisting of some
material produced or introduced by human activity. Some of the special considerations
of this dating application warrant explanation.
The sample consisted of humates in clay separates collected from Zone III, an early
Holocene fluvial deposit stratigraphically isolated from and situated below, the cultural
material of Zone V. Humates, in this particular case, are organic matter made up of
humins and humic acids which are absorbed and adsorbed within the clay structure while
the clay is wet and being stream transported, and its structure is open and expanded.
Once the clay is deposited and buried, it is compressed and its structure closed, sealing
within it the contemporary organic matter and excluding any subsequent intrusion of
younger organic matter.

HUMATE RADIOCARBON DATE I 85

In the field, this sample was collected from the wall of a freshly excavated unit. This
is important as exposure in the face of an excavation, even for relatively short periods of
time, may result in partial reduction of sample reliability. Care was also taken to
minimize contamination of the sample during collection from overlying or underlying
sediments.
Laboratory processing of a soil or sediment sample varies somewhat according to
its individual properties, but 8 "pretreatment" steps must be taken in most cases. These
are as follows:
(1) Disaggregation; this is accomplished by placing the sample in a 20 liter
stainless steel container and total1y disaggregating it by adding water and
stirring.
(2) Removal of rootlets; upon disaggregation, rootlets will float to the top and
can be removed by decanting, screening, vacuum suction, blotting with glass
filter paper, skimming with lintless paper, or some combination of these
techniques, until all have been removed.
(3) Screening; the sample is passed through 170 to 230 mesh screen (USGS).
(4) Removal of carbonates; the screened sample is acidified with 6N solution
of cold HCI to dissolve all carbonates; it is digested in HCI for 24 to 48 hours,
as needed, to dissolve all carbonates (especially dolomitic carbonate).
(5) Removal of supernatant HCI; vacuum suction is used to draw supernatant
HCI off; very tiny rootlets dislodged by the effects of HCI treatment are also
removed by this process.
(6) Washing; the sample is washed repeatedly with distilled water and stirred;
each time the sample settles, the supernatant liquid is removed by suction; the
end product is slightly acidic.
(7) Drying; the sample is dried in an oven at approximately 105"C; the resultant
clay cake is crushed to a fine powder.
(8) Burning; the powder is burned in a medium of pure medical oxygen in a
quartz combustion chamber.
Subsequent treatment follows that of normal radiocarbon samples. It should be
noted that probably no dating technique is better suited for Quaternary geomorphologiÂ­
cal purposes where sedimentary clay is available and when accurate and reliable ages are
needed (cf. Blum and Valastro 1989). Archeologically, the technique is of value when
quality samples of cultural origin are lacking and when archeological vestiges occur in a
determinable relationship with clayey soils or sediments (cf. Collins et al. 1989).

CONCLUSIONS
The investigated portion of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site consisted of a clearly
defined, lower component and an overlying deposit with sparse and ill-defined cultural
evidence. Effort was directed almost exclusively toward recovery and interpretation of
data from the lower component. The diagnostic artifacts and geologic context of the
lower cultural component, as well as the chronometric age of an underlying sedimentary
deposit, all support an assignment of this component to an early Holocene age and to an
early Archaic cultural manifestation. Investigation of the site focused on issues of human
ecology and employed a mix of traditional and innovative techniques. The findings
reflect this approach and are summarized and discussed here topically.
ARCHEOLOGICAL METHODS
Anthropology, in general, and archeology, in particular, have long made use of the
comparative method where the relationships among variables are investigated in multiple
case studies in lieu of controlled experimentation. This approach is absolutely necessary
for many of the kinds of topics investigated - no sane controlled experiment could be
devised to measure a horticultural society's response to cycles of drought, for example.
Archeologists have successfully employed the comparative method to questions ranging
from fundamental issues of human evolution down to functions of specific artifact forms.
Continued use of the comparative method is unavoidable for much that arÂ­
cheologists research. Unfortunately, the method is not efficient. In these times when
archeological sites are being lost at an ever-accelerating pace and the costs of doing
archeology are escalating, efficiency must be a concern to all archeologists. We must,
therefore, launch a concerted effort to break the comparative method habit by using more
efficient approaches whenever possible. The crux of this inefficient situation is the
unpredictable nature of the archeological record and the need to obtain multiple cases
with all of the relevant variables in all of the needed states of variation. When investigatÂ­
ing the relationship between any two variables, it is often impossible to know before
excavation if a given site will yield data on the variables in the needed states, and it can
take years before enough relevant cases can be amassed.
Improving archeometric techniques can be used to much more efficiently investigate
some of the kinds of questions which we have traditionally approached using the comÂ­
parative method. For example, the function of a particular ceramic form might eventually
be determined from enough cases where context and associations indicated a particular
use. With the recently developed ability to extract and identify organic residues from the
interior surface of ceramic vessels, a much more direct and efficient avenue of research
is opened. It is in this spirit that the Camp Pearl Wheat project was executed.

87

88 / CONCLUSIONS

Archeometric inquiry at this site included recovery, identification, and interpretaÂ­
tion of chemical/organic residues in soil samples, on burned rocks, and on stone tools. It
also investigated arch eo magnetic properties of burned limestone rocks. The carbon
isotope character of one of the depositional strata at the site was also determined for
environmental information. These efforts were directed toward two purposes, investigaÂ­
tion of the site's human ecology and development of effective procedures for using these
relatively untried techniques. The human ecological results are discussed in the apÂ­
propriate sections below, but the methodological considerations deserve attention here.
Since the use of archeometry for the purposes and under the conditions expected at
the Camp Pearl Wheat Site had little precedent, it was not prudent to undertake full-scale
research of this kind. We proposed a modest effort that we hoped would be sufficient to
test the methods and to improve our understanding of the site.
Soil phosphate analysis produced disappointing results for lack of sufficient phosÂ­
phate residue in the soil, so we learned almost nothing about the site using this procedure.
However, this is a time-proven research technique (Cook and Heizer 1965; Dauncey
1952; Limbrey 1975; Cornwall 1958) and it should be employed whenever possible. The
effort required to collect soil chemistry samples in the field is minor and would be
appropriate in any site where occupation surfaces or features can be isolated for samÂ­
pling. A few of the samples can then be selected for testing before a decision is made to
process large numbers of samples.
In contrast, the carbon isotopic data from the single radiocarbon sample did provide
limited but useful information on the paleoecology of the region. This should become
routine in all archeological inquiry. Biotic isotopes have great potential for paleoecologiÂ­
cal research of whatever kind.
Identification of organic residues on artifacts may be the most underutilized techÂ­
nique available to archeologists. For relatively modest costs, insoluble residues on
ceramics, stone tools, or almost any artifact can often be recovered and identified. These
determinations in concert with contextual evidence, use-wear data, and other informaÂ­
tion directly accomplish what immense comparative method effort mayor may not
accomplish indirectly. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that such residues had
survived 5 or 6 millennia in a shallow open site and could provide valuable insights into
the history of the site. Our regret is that more determinations could not have been made.
Organic residue analysis creates a logistical problem that must be considered when
planning field work and artifact analysis. Specimens should be collected without being
touched with bare hands and they cannot be washed in the usual laboratory fashion.
Specialized extraction of the residues needs to be done prior to handling for the purposes
of taking measurements or writing descriptions. This means that specimens will be
selected for organic residue analysis in an unwashed and unclassified state. Which
further means that the selected group may not be considered optimum when viewed after
cleaning. Diverting a portion of a collection for the extended time needed for residue
analysis also interferes with classification of the entire collection. One partial solution
to this set of problems is to quickly send all specimens judged in the field to be worthy
of residue analysis (and collected with suitable care) to the organic residue analyst for

TRADmONAL INTERPRETIVE RESULTS / 89

residue extraction. The extract can be stored for a time (a year or more) while the cleaned
artifacts are evaluated and classified and the optimum sample for residue analysis
identified, the extract from those specimens can then be processed.
Organic residues on chipped stone tools indicated that both plant and animal
materials were processed. The correlations between chipped stone artifacts form and
nature of residues is particularly provocative (see below).
Burned rocks also retained identifiable plant and animal residues. It is not yet
possible to distinguish fuel from food, or even some other heat-processed item of
material culture, or to say for certain how the residues came to be present on certain
rocks. We do not know, for example, if drippings from food cooked on hearth stones can
be distinguished from food residue that might impregnate a rock used in stone boiling.
We suggest that in future projects that different surfaces of single rocks be sampled
independently. If an even distribution of the same residue occurs over the entire rock,
stone boiling seems probable. Hearth slabs, on the other hand, could be expected to have
all, or most, of the residue on their upper surface.
For all of these efforts, much more detailed sampling and documentation is needed.
Blades should be sampled for residues independently of stems of projectile points; each
surface of burned rocks should be sampled separately and the surfaces identified accordÂ­
ing to position and orientation in the field. The ~ burned rocks for which
archeomagnetic data (see below) are available should be sampled for organic residues.
Thus, it would be possible to determine any correlations between identified residues,
temperature reached, and position in relation to last heating-cooling orientation.
Archeomagnetic properties of burned rock are productive data in investigating past
human behavior. The few samples processed from the Camp Pearl Wheat Site suggest
several ways in which the technique can be applied in the study of hearths, burned rock
middens, and possibly other features. The field collection method used was relatively
clumsy. When samples are to be processed in a cryogenic magnetometer, core drilling
of samples in the field is faster and more accurate than the plaster cast technique devised
for this project. We also learned in the paleomagnetic laboratory that with more careful
sampling, particularly of larger burned rocks, fairly precise estimates can be made of the
temperature to which rocks were heated and that temperature gradients might be used
to estimate the length of time a stone was exposed to heat. As with organic residue
sampling, more intensive and fully documented sampling for archeomagnetic analysis will
prove more informative.
As larger, more precisely controlled sets of data emerge, better behavioral inferenÂ­
ces will be possible. Data quality is of primary importance in inquiry o( this kind,
especially contextual precision.

TRADITIONAL INTERPRETIVE RESULTS
Physically the Camp Pearl Wheat Site consisted of a thin archeological component
buried in an early Holocene terrace of Town Creek. Six discrete hearths, a scatter of
burned rocks, and a thin lithic scatter comprised the lower component which lay beneath

90 I CONCLUSIONS

30 to 35 cm of pedogenically-altered alluvium. This overlying alluvium also contained
archeological materials, but they were so diffuse and sparse that no information was to
be gained from their investigation. Almost 100 m2 of the lower component were exposed
and documented in this investigation, but several constraints made it impossible to
estimate what the total extent of the site may have been. The site had been cut along its
southern edge by the road (FM 783) and along its western edge by Town Creek. Our
excavation was limited to the proposed new FM 783 right-of-way and it was not practical
to excavate underneath the private caliche road east of our excavation area. It is possible
that portions of the site have been lost or went uninvestigated, but the debris concentraÂ­
tion on which our excavation centered tapered off near the limits of the excavated area
and we feel that we recovered a comprehensive sample of the concentration. If the site
were once larger, it may have consisted of additional concentrations similar to the one
investigated. Thus, the investigated component was very clearly demarcated vertically
and seemed to have been a debris concentration of relatively limited horizontal extent.
It seemed to approach as nearly as could be expected the archeological manifestations
of a single array of human activities.
In the testing phase of the site, the conclusion was reached that the deposits
underlying the early Archaic component were of Pleistocene age (Young 1988). During
the later excavation by TARL, study of the underlying deposits noted sparse cultural
materials and produced a radiocarbon sample dated to 7130Â± 190 years B.P., corrected for
d 13C to 7300Â±190years B.P. (Tx 6566); this suggests an early Holocene age for the entire
suite of deposits making up the terrace in which the site occurs.
Compared with the results of many archeological excavations in Central Texas, the
amount of material collected by this project might seem meager - 7 projectile points. 28
other chipped stone pieces, and 2877 pieces of debitage. The "meagerness" is, in fact,
an expression of the site's most salient and important aspect-brief utilization. This
brevity offered the investigators an opportunity to develop a "snapshot" of human
behavior at a moment in the past. So often we investigate sites that produce unintelÂ­
ligible, multiple exposures when the detritus of protracted or repeated occupations is
mixed in the archeological deposits.
In traditional terms, the lower component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site fits into
Weir's (1976) San Geronimo "Phase" or Prewitt's (1981, 1985) Jarrell "Phase" of the
early Archaic. The small number of diagnostic artifacts recovered is not a statistically
powerful data set. but as a stratigraphically isolated assemblage, this data set strongly
supports Prewitt's refinement of Weir's chronological segmentation of the Central Texas
Archaic. All of the projectile point forms (except Andice) that Prewitt attributes to his
Jarrell "Phase" are represented, and no others occur. We recovered Martindale, Uvalde,
and Bell types of projectile points. That the relatively rarer Andice type was not present
in so small an assemblage is not considered particularly significant; however, it may be a
clue that further cultural chronological refinement is needed. The Bell point recovered
in this project was found on the surface where backdirt from SDHPT testing had been
piled. We have interpreted this to be evidence that the point was originally part of the
Jarrell Interval component. In fact, it may not have been. Bell and Andice points are
similar in form and may be contemporaries. Bell points post-dated Martindale points at

the Landslide Site (41BL85) in Bell County (Sorrow et al. 1967), raising the possibility
that Prewitt's Jarrell "Phase" collapses temporally-distinct forms into a single interval.
The early Archaic component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site yielded only non-perishÂ­
able archeological materials. There was no charcoal, bone or other organic material
suitable for radiocarbon dating, and the soil matrix immediately surrounding the arÂ­
cheological deposit was not deemed a suitable material for such dating. This was because,
although it was sufficiently clayey and probably represented fluvial deposition very
shortly following the site's utilization by humans, soil development extending downward
from the present surface had undoubtedly altered the organic content of the matrix. As
discussed above, the date of 7300Â± 190 years B.P. on the underlying stratum is consistent
with the estimated age of 5100 to 6100 years B.P. for a Jarrell assemblage (Prewitt 1985).
Other than projectile points, no functionally specialized artifact forms were
recovered, even routine implements such as hammerstones or manos. Debitage and
unfinished bifaces attest to knapping activities and the few unifaces are of generalized
rather than specialized forms.
The area excavated consisted of a thin scatter of debris around six hearths. There
is no clear pattern to this distribution, no post molds or confined debris to suggest that a
structure (or structures) was once present. The reason that three of the features are in
such close proximity is not readily apparent. The hint that the hearths may have had
different functions (see below) makes it more plausible that they were used contemÂ­
poraneously, but a sequence of occupations over a relatively brief interval of prehistory
is also possible. A question that arises from this burned rock pattern is whether sites of
this sort in any way presage the development of burned rock middens later in the Central
Texas Archaic.
Would repeated intermittent use of the Camp Pearl Wheat locality, at the same
intensity indicated for this component, eventually result in formation of a burned rock
midden or do such middens result from a shift in human-ecological behavior? The Camp
Pearl Wheat Site does not answer the question, but it does suggest that burned rock have
intrinsic characteristics useful in answering the question. Hearth stones in this site were
mostly left to cool in place after their last heating. If burned rock middens are made up
of multiple intersecting hearths, portions of individual hearths should be discernable by
this characteristic. On the other hand, if burned rock middens are central disposal
dumps, essentially random magnetic orientations should prevail among the constituent
burned rocks.
ARCHEOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS

The current terminology used in the cultural-historical schemes for Central Texas is
inappropriate in that it carries implications of ethnicity when, in fact, chronological
patterning among items of material culture is all that is depicted. We do not know what
the adaptive, political, linguistic, ethnic, and social correlates are to documented changes
in site types, ratios among artifact forms, and stylistic variability in certain artifact
categories.

92 / CONCLUSIONS

Of particular concern (see Johnson 1987) is use of the term "phase." We propose
that "interval" is a culturally neutral term that emphasizes the temporal dimension of
both Weir's (1976) and Prewitt's (1981, 1985) chronological schemes. As more detail is
available, the social, ethnic, linguistic, or any other aspect of the materials characterizing
any particular interval can be discussed, investigated, and revised without unintended
behavioral implications. In this vein, the remainder of this discussion refers to the early
Archaic component at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site as belonging the "Jarrell IntervaL"
Otherwise, all of Prewitt's (1981, 1985) defining traits and chronology are employed with
almost no modification.
ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS AND HUMAN ECOLOGY

The locality of the site today is, as it was at the time of the site's occupation, in an
upland reach of a minor tributary valley. Upstream from the site is a limited catchment
with steep slopes and stream gradients. Early in the Holocene the locality was aggrading
and the stream was not deeply incised below the floor of the valley. At the specific site
locality, the flood plain was gravelly and evidently traversed by intermittent flood chutes
that tended to shift laterally from time to time. At ca. 7300 years ago, relatively fineÂ­
grained overbank flood deposits dominated at the site. Carbon isotope data suggest that
the clays were derived from a landscape with mixed floral cover. The o13C value
associated with the radiocarbon sample (Tx 6566) is -15Â°/00 which yields a calculated
estimate that ca. 40% of the plant biomass consisted of C-3 plants (Dzurec et al. 1985;
Boutton et al. 1980). This suggests that C-4 grasses and CAM vegetation must account
for ca. 60% of the biomass contribution to the organic makeup of the sediment laid down
by the stream. These ratios would be consistent with a savanna type of habitat. InterestÂ­
ingly, 7300 years B.P. is a time of apparent absence or very low numbers of bison in Central
Texas. It is also early in the Altithermal. Unquestionably, Altithermal effects varied
significantly over the landscape and were noticeably more severe to the northwest on the
Llano Estacado (Holliday 1985a, 1985b; Meltzer and Collins 1987), but some effect was
probably felt in the local area of the Camp Pearl Wheat Site. Some 1000 to 2000 years
later when the site was occupied (based on Prewitt's chronology for Jarrell manifestaÂ­
tions) the site's surface was once again gravelly, bison were briefly present or more
numerous in the region (Prewitt 1981), and on the Llano Estacado the Altithermal
experienced a brief reversal to more mesic conditions (Holliday 1985a, 1985b). Also, at
nearby Hall's Cave (Toomey 1989), a faunal shift is evident between 6000 and 5000 years
B.P. that indicates drying conditions were altering the local faunal assemblage. The
contemporaneity of the mesic break in the Altithermal and bison presence in the early
Archaic archeological record may be coincidental, but is certainly an issue warranting
further investigation.
Evidently by the time people were camping at this site, the stream had already begun
to deepen its channel. This would raise the relative elevation of the campsite above the
stream and reduce the risk of flooding. The small gravel pockets found on the campsite
surface attest to flooding, but the in situ nature of burned rocks, including relatively small
ones, as well as the small size of the gravel clasts, indicate that the flooding was of modest
energy. This was probably as a result of being higher in the floodwater column. The

ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS AND HUMAN ECOLOGY I 93

alluvium overlying the early Archaic component is basically fine-grained and is clearly in
the overbank flood regime. These data suggest that the site was occupied during the
active downcutting of streams in the region (compare with Quaternary "Unit E" in the
Pedernales valley; Blum and Valastro 1989). As better dating and fuller understanding
of this regional episode of stream downcutting are developed, a more complete picture
of the adaptation represented by this component may emerge.
The late Quaternary edaphic history of the Edwards Plateau seems to be one of soil
development followed by soil stripping. The tempo of this cycle seems to have increased
during the Holocene because the earliest period of soil erosion (ending in the early
Holocene) removed a soil of advanced maturity whereas continued soil erosion in the
middle and late Holocene has removed less developed soils.
Human adaptations during the Jarrell Interval in Central Texas can be inferred in
part from available data, but there is still much to be learned. Small groups utilizing both
plant and animal resources evidently prevailed during this interval. There is no evidence
of marked specialization, which fits the paleoclimatic reconstruction posited here:
during the Jarrell Interval, of an estimated 1 millennium duration, there was an early
trend toward warmer and dryer conditions, followed by a more mesic period of perhaps
500 years during which bison were exploited, followed at last by a return to drying and
warming. Bison and other animals as well as substantial aspects of the flora must have
responded significantly to these climatic changes and ecological consequences to humans
were undoubtedly substantial. Generalized adaptations of the sort envisioned as prevailÂ­
ing during the Jarrell Interval are the best suited for such changes. That we do not detect
more cultural change within this interval is suggestive of a successful adaptation.
The Camp Pearl Wheat Site was utilized on one or more occasions by a small group
processing both plant and animal resources. In doing this, several hearths were built and
used, evidently in distinctive ways. The data available are too few for conclusive beÂ­
havioral interpretations, but the following inferences can be derived from the limited
data base.
One hearth (Feature 1) experienced relatively low temperatures (ca. 350-375"C) and
only plant residue was found on the one stone tested for organic residue. The analyzed
stones from this hearth had cooled in place. That this hearth is unique and is situated on
the periphery of the main concentration of burned rock, hearths, and chipped stone
pieces may reflect spatial patterning of activities within the site.
Also peripheral to the main concentration were two other hearths (Features 2 and
4). Feature 2 at the south edge of the site had been disrupted prior to any archeological
investigations of the site, and almost no data exists on its size, form, organic ,residue, or
archeomagnetic characteristics.
Feature 4 was a small hearth near the northern edge of the excavated area. It was
smaller than, and not as tightly organized as, the hearths in the main site concentration.
No organic residue data were obtained on this feature and the one archeomagnetic
sample yielded evidence that the stone had been heated to ca. 550Â°C and had cooled in
place.

94 I CONCLUSIONS

The large, well organized hearth, Feature 7, included 4 stones heated to near 600 e
which cooled in place. Two burned rocks had only animal lipid residues and one yielded
a lipid residue that could not be assigned to either plant or animal origins. The high
animal residue evidence indicates that this hearth may have been used for the cooking of
meat, and the high temperature raises the possibility of fat being accidently or intentionÂ­
ally part of the fuel.
0

Nearby Feature 6 was slightly smaller but equally well organized. Organic residues
in this feature included animal lipids on three rocks, plant lipids on one rock, and lipids
of both kinds on one rock. One archeomagnetic sample yielded evidence of temperature
in excess of 600 e and another had been heated to only about 375Â°. The latter was lower
in the basin of the feature and may have been insulated from the heat somewhat by ash
or dirt on top of it. Both of the archeomagnetic samples had cooled in place. This feature
and Feature 7 may have functioned similarly. The plant lipid evidence could have
resulted either from fuel, such as sap dripping from green firewood, or from a plant food
being cooked in the hearth. The burning of food scraps or other refuse could also account
for any of the residues found in these features.
0

The most interesting feature in regard to evidence for its use is Feature 3. Organic
residues on burned rocks included plant lipids on one rock and both animal and plant
lipids on two rocks. The four archeomagnetically analyzed stones reveal complex heatÂ­
ing-cooling histories. The four stones had all been heated to 500 to 600 e. One stone
had cooled and then was moved prior to coming to rest in the position in which we found
it. Another had cooled from ca. 500 e in place. Two stones manifested two paleomagÂ­
netic orientations each. Alternative explanations for this evidence exist. In the first, the
pattern could be the result of the stones having been heated to 550 to 600o e, cooled down
to ca. 250 to 350Â°, moved, and continued cooling to ambient temperature in the second
position. Or, they may have been heated to ca. 550 to 600Â°, cooled, been moved, then
reheated to ca. 250 to 350Â°. Assuming for the moment that the first explanation is correct,
it would suggest that the feature was an earth oven opened for removal of the food when
the covering stones were still fairly hot. This interpretation would be consistent with the
scatter of rocks adjacent to the west side of this hearth ("Feature 5") if the latter resulted
from opening the oven. Unfortunately, only two archeomagnetic samples were taken
from the burned rock scatter, and they produced inconsistent results-one stone was
moved after cooling and the other cooled in place from ca. 550-600o e. Three organic
residue samples from the area of scattered rocks ("Feature 5") included two with both
plant and animal lipids and one with only animal lipids. These residue data are not
conclusive, but they are consistent with the data from Feature 3. Of course, it is equally
plausible that Feature 3 was simply used a final time in a manner that only brought
temperatures up to the 250-350Â° range. More thorough investigation with more'detailed
internal provenience controls in features of this kind has the potential of distinguishing
such patterns of usein the future. Attempts to refit fragments from within hearths with
those in nearby rock scatters would add important evidence to be considered in making
such distinctions.

Particular attention should be paid to any evidence for environmental data relevant
to the early Archaic in all future archeological investigations on the Edwards Plateau and

ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS AND HUMAN ECOLOGY I 95

elsewhere in Central Texas. Physica1 strata, soils, flora, and fauna, including their isotopic
traits, are all potentially informative - especially when their investigation is integrated
and good chronological controls can be maintained. Continued inquiry into the human
response to, and any roll in, environmental changes is particularly germane.
The importance of archeological data quality is underscored by the investigations
at the Camp Pearl Wheat Site. The tight geologic context ofthis component is particularly
important because all other aspects of the investigation build on the site's integrity. It
seems clear that in the upper reaches of valleys in the region, early Holocene deposits
prevail. These can be identified readily by the mature soils developed on them (Krum
and its equivalents). Sites of early Archaic age should be found buried in these deposits
and such sites have the potential of having good stratigraphic integrity. Middle to late
Holocene deposition was minimal in these areas and sites from these time periods will
not occur in good stratigraphic context except in unusual settings. On the other hand,
the larger valleys contain abundant deposits of middle and late Holocene age and the
potential of there being many sites in excellent geologic context is high. The net effect
of these regional patterns is that, first, the site distributional data from the region cannot
be construed as settlement pattern data, and, second, future investigations in the region
should consider this regional phenomenon and use it to maximize the quality of data.

SOIL TEXTURE AND CHEMISTRY: METHODS AND DATA
James T. Abbott

INTRODUCTION

Anthrosolic, as well as natural pedogenic, soil attributes were analyzed using
samples from the Camp Pearl Wheat Site (41KR243). Samples for anthrosolic phosphate
analysis were collected from each I-meter grid point over the entire site at the level of
the early Archaic component, but only 18 were processed initially to determine if usable
results could be obtained. The Stratigraphic Column in the site was sampled in 10 cm
levels for pedogenic textural and chemical analyses. These were conducted primarily for
descriptive purposes and are not considered to reflect human processes.
Phosphate Analysis
METHODS

Qualitative phosphate determination was accomplished with the "ring test"
described by Eidt (1973), which is designed to give a rough indication of total inorganic
phosphate. The application of this procedure was: small quantity of soil (approximately
0.5 g) was placed upon an ashless filter paper and wet with two drops of an extracting
reagent composed of 5.0 g of ammonium molybdate, 35 ml of 6N HCI, and 100 ml of
distilled water. After allowing the reagent to react for 30 seconds, 2 drops of a developing
reagent consisting of 0.5 g of ascorbic acid dissolved in 100 ml of water were added to the
sample. If phosphate was present, a blue ring quickly developed around the sample. A
qualitative value of 1 (none), 2 (weak), 3 (average), 4 (good), or 5 (strong) was assigned
to the sample based on the size, intensity, and time of appearance of the blue ring, as
described by Eidt (1973).
Quantitative phosphate was determined using a method adapted from- Olsen and
Dean (1965) and involved extraction of phosphate with a sodium bicarbonate solution.
This alkaline solution procedure was selected to extract relatively available phosphate
only and avoid the extraction of calcium-bound phosphates. Three reagents were used
in the determinations. The extracting solution consisted of 0.5M sodium bicarbonate and
was prepared by dissolving 41.99 g of bicarbonate in 1 liter of deionized H20. An
ammonium molybdate developing solution was prepared by dissolving 7.5 g of
ammonium molybdate in 150 ml of deionized water, adding 171 ml of concentrated HCI,

and diluting the solution to 500 ml. A concentrated stannous chloride solution was
prepared by dissolving 2 g stannous chloride crystals in 5 ml of concentrated HCI. A
dilute stannous chloride solution was then prepared by diluting 0.5 ml of the concentrated
solution with 66 ml of deionized water. For each sample,S g of air-dry lO-mesh soil were
weighed out and allowed to soak, with occasional stirring, in 100 ml of sodium
bicarbonate solution for four to five days. This technique is in contrast to the 30 minute
shaker method described by Olsen and Dean (1965), which was not possible due to the
unavailability of a wrist action shaker. An aliquot of 30 to 40 ml of the solution was then
decanted from the sample and placed in an Erlenmayer flask. To eliminate the brown
color of aliquots taken from samples with significant organic matter, several grams of
carbon lampblack were added to the flask, and the mixture was shaken vigorously and
filtered through Whatman No. 40 ashless filter paper. Because of low organic content,
this process was only necessary for a few of the samples. A 5 ml aliquot of the extract
was then placed into 150 ml beaker with a volumetric pipette. To this extract was added
5 ml of the ammonium molybdate solution. After the evolution of C02 ceased, 10 ml of
deionized H20 was added. This was followed by 1 ml of a dilute stannous chloride
solution, which reduced the phosphomolybdate ions and resulted in the development of
a blue color indicating the amount of phosphate present. Eight to ten minutes after the
addition of the stannous chloride, an aliquot of the solution was transferred by pipette
into a lI2-inch test tube and the intensity of the blue color was measured on a Bausch &
Lomb Spectronic 20 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 660 pm. Concentration was
determined from a curve constructed previously using a series of phosphate aliquots of
known concentration.
For the eighteen samples processed, the results, in parts per million (ppm), are
consistently very low (less than 22 ppm) with the exception of 2 samples (Table 7). These
samples, collected from N1l6/E98 and NIOI/E1l1 are 75 ppm and 33 ppm, respectively.
These are each isolated cases in that adjacent samples in the grid showed the consistently
low levels indicating that these are small anomalies more likely the result of such things
as root or rodent penetrations rather than areas of culturally elevated phosphate levels.
The results (Table 7) suggest that the very low and almost uniform quantities of phosphate
in the samples are the consequence of extreme leaching of this soil horizon. It was judged
not to be worthwhile to perform phosphate analysis on the remainder of the samples.
Textural, Organic Content, and Carbonate Content Analyses
of Stratigraphic Column (N98/E94 through NIOO/E94).

Textural, organic content, and carbonate content analyses were performed to aid in
the interpretation of the depositional and pedogenic environment of the site as well as
to provide basic comparative data on early Holocene deposits and soils in the region.
The methods and results of these are reported below.

METHODS
Textural Analysis
Particle size analysis was accomplished using sieves and hydrometer. Due to the
generally low organic matter content, samples were not pre-treated to remove organic
matter; likewise, decalcification was not performed because the clastic material was
derived from limestone. Two different methods were employed to subdivide the samples;
when feasible, aggregates were sampled, otherwise, the entire sample was ground and
split. Samples for hydrometer analysis were allowed to soak in a sodium pyrophosphate
solution for one week to deflocculate the clays. Hydrometer readings were taken after
the sediment had been allowed to settle for 1 minute, 3.5 minutes, 45 minutes, 300
minutes (5 hours), and (approximately) 2880 minutes (48 hours). Sieving was performed
at whole phi intervals from -50 to 40. The data were entered into a computer program
that computed raw and cumulative weight percentages, gravel!sand/silt/c1ay percentages
(Table 8), and graphic statistics (Fig. 31).

Organic Content Analysis

Organic matter was determined according to the method described by Graham
(1948). This method is a modification of the Walkley-Black procedure which utilized a
spectrophotometer rather than titration for determination and allows rapid and simulÂ­
taneous processing of a number of samples, while at the same time providing reasonable
accuracy. The method of organic matter determination was as follows: 1 g of air-dry
10-mesh soil was placed in a 250 ml Erlenmayer flask, and 10 ml of IN potassium
dichromate was added. Then 20 m1 of concentrated, reagent-grade sulfuric acid was
added by means of a 100 ml burette. The resulting mixture was agitated by hand for 10
seconds and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. One hundred ml of deionized H20 was
then added, and the mixture was allowed to stand for four hours. The supernatant liquid
was then transferred into lI2-inch test tubes with a pipette and the transmittance of the
solution at 645 pm incident light was determined. Concentration was read off the curve
provided by Graham (1948). See Table 9 for results.

Carbonate Content Analysis
Carbonate content was analyzed using the chittick apparatus (see Machette 1986 for
a thorough description of the method). The mass of samples analyzed was either 1.7 g
and 0.85 g, depending on overall carbonate content. Samples were digested in 20 ml of
RCI. Uncorrected carbonate content was computed using the method described by
Machette (1986). Because no barometer was available to make corrections for variations
in air pressure, values were corrected by regression from a line fit to gas volumes obtained
by digesting amounts of ground calcite equivalent to 10%,20%, and 30% soil carbonate
(0.17 g, 0.34 g, 0.51 g). See Table 10 for results.
