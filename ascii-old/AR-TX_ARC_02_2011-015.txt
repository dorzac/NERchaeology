ABSTRACT
The Trinity River Authority intends to construct the Coppell Interceptor in
northwestern Dallas County, Texas. Proposed construction efforts include
the installation of approximately 3,400 linear feet of a new 48-inch pipe
starting at an existing manhole east of MacArthur Blvd. and proceeding
east across the floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River where it
will connect to an existing junction box. This new 48-inch pipe will
parallel the existing 33-inch Coppell Interceptor and will be located within
the existing 20-foot utility easement. Going east from the junction box
approximately 6,400 feet of the existing 33-inch Coppell Interceptor will
be rehabilitated or replaced by open cut. Included in this total is the
replacement of the aerial crossing of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.
The 6,400 feet of 33-inch pipe rehabilitation or replacement will follow
the existing alignment and will be located within the existing 20-foot
utility easement. The total project length is approximately 10,000 feet.
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., which is handling the environmental
permitting for the project, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct
a cultural resource survey of the proposed sewer line route. Given the
floodplain setting of the study area, previous investigations and a
preliminary pedestrian survey of the route demonstrated that the channel
margin of the Elm Fork presented the highest potential for containing
buried prehistoric cultural resources. A low knoll east of the Elm Fork
channel was also identified as an area of high probability. Additionally, a
mapped historic structure located east of the channel was identified during
a map review. Backhoe trenches were placed on either side of the Elm
Fork channel, two shovel tests were excavated at the approximate location
of the structure, and three shovel tests were excavated atop the low knoll
east of the channel. A third backhoe trench was excavated west of a small
unnamed drainage located on the east side of McInnish Park. However, no
cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey, or in the five
shovel tests or three backhoe trenches excavated within the route. AR
Consultants, Inc. concludes that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted in the study area, and recommends that the Texas Historical
Commission concurs with this assessment.

INTRODUCTION
The Trinity River Authority (TRA) intends to construct the Coppell Interceptor in
northwestern Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). The TRA plans to install approximately
3,400 feet of new 48-inch pipe, which will run from an existing manhole on the east side
of MacArthur Blvd. and will connect to an existing junction box approximately 3,700
feet to the east of MacArthur Blvd. This new pipeline will cross the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River, will parallel the existing 33-inch Coppell Interceptor, and will be located
within the existing 20-foot utility easement. East of the junction box, approximately
6,400 feet of the existing 33-inch pipe will be rehabilitated in situ or will be removed and
replaced along the same alignment and located within the existing 20-foot utility
easement. Included in this section is replacement of the aerial crossing of the Elm Fork of
the Trinity River. The depths of installation will range from 10 to 12 feet in most areas,
with short sections up to 15 feet for the sewer line while the crossing at the Elm Fork will
be crossed with an aerial span. The proposed route parallels both Belt Line Road and the
St. Louis/Southwestern Railroad to the south, and ends at Luna Road. The total project
length is approximately 10,000 feet.
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (Jacobs) is handling the environmental permitting for the
project, and contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct a cultural resource
survey, which included archival research to determine the prehistoric and historic
archaeological potential in the proposed project area. In the scope of work dated October
29, 2010, ARC recommended that the high potential areas, which include the channel
margin on either side of the Elm Fork, a knoll east of the channel and the location of a
mapped historic structure, be surveyed and mechanically tested for undisturbed buried
cultural resources. The Texas Historical Commission agreed with this survey strategy.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the Trinity River Authority of
Texas is a political entity of the State of Texas, and Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5793 was issued for the archaeological survey. In addition, since the sewer line is to be
placed within the waters of the US, it will fall within the jurisdiction of the Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation
Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended PL92500 and
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as the Section
106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural
setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations surrounding the study area. A chapter on the research design and

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area lies in the Blackland Prairie plant community of North Central Texas,
which is bordered on the west by the Eastern Cross Timbers (Diamond, Riskind, Orzell
1987: Figure 1). More specifically, the survey area is in the floodplain of the Elm Fork of
the Trinity River. The Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford shale flanks and underlies the Elm
Fork floodplain and is bordered to the east and south by Quaternary terraces. The surface
of the survey area is mapped as Quaternary alluvium, which is Holocene in age (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1988). Geological studies within the Elm Fork basin indicate that
floodplain deposits dating to 18,000 BC are present (Prikryl 1990:17).
The Elm Fork floodplain is generally flat and frequently inundated when heavy rains
occur upstream. The route is located primarily in floodplain soils, including both
occasionally flooded Trinity and occasionally flooded Frio clays, which are situated on
either side of the Elm Fork channel. East of the unnamed drainage located on the east
side of McInnish Park, loamy Arents are encountered (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980:
Map 2). These consist of areas that have been mined for gravel and sand, and contain
discarded mining overburden. The natural profile encountered in these soils has likely
been disturbed to some degree, judging by the considerable amount of construction that
has taken place within the study area.
Knappable gravels are noted to occur on the surface of the surrounding uplands (Peter
and McGregor 1988:281, Figure 13-2). In terms of usable stone, the Uvalde Gravels were
the major source for lithic raw material during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric in the
Upper Trinity watershed. Gravel fields and quarry sites have been recorded on the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River, south of Lake Lewisville (McGregor 1995). These gravels
consist of about 90 percent quartzite and 10 percent chert (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217-218).
The Blackland Prairie may be generally described as a medium tall, rather dense
grassland, dominated by little bluestem and Texas needlegrass (Küchler 1964:76). Small
stands of timber (elm, oak, pecan, etc.) are present in the prairie also. Although situated
in the Blackland Prairie, the study area also lies within the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), which features relatively low biotic diversity. Only forty-nine species of mammals
occur in the Texan province, including deer, raccoon, rabbits and opossum. The local
riparian environment features a more diverse biotic setting, with forty-one of the
aforementioned mammals, six of the nine lizards, both terrapin species and twenty-seven
of the snake species present in a this setting.
The climate in Dallas County is generally mild, featuring hot summers and cool winters
punctuated by occasional surges of cold air and plummeting temperature. Average daily
temperature is 66.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the
year, though peaking in spring. Average yearly rainfall is 36.06 inches (Coffee et al.
1980).

CULTURAL HISTORY
A definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin and North
Central Texas has been difficult to establish for several reasons. Many sites are not
vertically stratified, bioturbation has impacted stratified deposits and plowing has mixed
artifacts in shallowly buried deposits. However, deep Holocene alluviation preserves
buried occupation surfaces, both in the Holocene deposits as at the Rough Green site on
the Trinity River near Arlington and in the Pleistocene deposits such as at the Aubrey site
near Lake Ray Roberts in Denton County. Without alluviation, these former surface
deposits would still be on the surface and mixed with bottles, nails and other historic
trash as well as the occupations in between. Additionally, plowing usually mixes together
surface artifacts with any that exist within 15 centimeters of the surface (Lorrain and
Hoffrichter 1968:6). However, for the purpose of this report, a prehistoric chronology,
based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period for North Central Texas is
presented below to provide a temporal framework for the culture history of the region.

6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began in the Paleo-Indian
period, at least 10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart
points at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring
2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff
and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region (Bever and Meltzer
2007). The presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early
people traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in
a system of raw material trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but
probably also foraged off the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from as early as 7,000 or 6,000 B.C. to
possibly as late as A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties
but particularly along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt
and gather native foods. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are
common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making
and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the
use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde
Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on
terraces or ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have

SURVEY OF THE TRA COPPELL INTERCEPTOR SEWER LINE

been recorded in upland areas throughout the counties. These sites appear to be Archaic
in age, but none have been thoroughly studied (Prikryl 1990).
The definition of the Late Prehistoric which ranges from approximately A.D. 700 to 1750
has been problematic. Krieger (1946:137-141) attempted a chronological framework for
North Central Texas when he defined the Henrietta Focus. The type site was the Harrell
Site along the Brazos River in Young County, Texas. Among the traits for the Henrietta
Focus, Krieger listed small, triangular points, Alba-barbed points, Harrell and Washita
points, contracting Perdiz points, Nocona Plain pottery, antler tines with blunt tips, bone
awls, and trade pottery from the Southwest and Southeast. Prikryl (1990:12) states that
the artifacts and features from the Henrietta Focus bear strong similarities to those at
Plains Village sites in the Southern Plains area. However, Peter and McGregor
(1988:367) believe that further research should be done on defining the Henrietta Focus.
Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create a chronological sequence for the Upper Trinity
River Basin when he defined the Wylie Focus, which was dated to A.D. 1300 to 1600,
based on shell and clay-grit tempered pottery which, he believed, was Caddoan in origin.
The Wylie Focus was characterized by large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed
burials (both single and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture and
villages. The term Wylie Focus as a cultural temporal marker was discarded when
Bruseth and Martin (1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point Island and the Adams Ranch
sites to the Late Archaic period.
The chronology for the Late Prehistoric is based on Prikryl’s work (1990) that included
surveys conducted in the Lower Elm Fork Branch of the Trinity River. Prikryl created a
chronology based on the projectile points from mostly surface collections. Influenced by
Lynott's earlier work (1977), Prikryl (1990:62) divided the Late Prehistoric into two
phases, the Late Prehistoric I, dating from 1250 to 750 B.P. and Late Prehistoric II, dating
from 750 B.P to 250 B.P. Late Prehistoric I diagnostic traits consisted of maize
horticulture, house remains, grog-tempered and sand-tempered pottery and Scallorn,
Alba, Steiner and Catahoula arrow points. Prikryl implied a subdivision of the Late
Prehistoric I phase because the Steiner, Alba-Bonham, Scallorn and Catahoula arrow
points are more common in the earlier portion of the Late Prehistoric I than the later. Late
Prehistoric II seems to occur about the time that the climate of northern Texas became
drier. Diagnostic traits include an emphasis on bison hunting, Washita, Fresno and
Harrell arrow points, bison scapula hoes, "Plains-like" lithic artifacts, and settlements on
sandy terraces above the floodplains (Late Prehistoric I people had lived on floodplains).
It is important to note that Prikryl suggested that site placement is suitable for agriculture,
even though there appears to be no evidence of agriculture except for the bison scapula
hoes. Todd (1999) believes that some form of agriculture existed in the Upper Trinity
River basin drainage based upon the presence of shell hoes. Experiments proved the shell
hoes would have worked to till sandy and loamy soils.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade
goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English traders (Skinner

1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to
factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists
who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region. There is very little
evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the counties although
historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s.
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible
visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a
chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate
that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants
continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states “Indian
hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to
less than half.” Hostilities continued until the Treaty of 1843 was signed by the State of
Texas and ten Native American tribes. This treaty provided the impetus for settlement of
several North Central Texas counties.
The Anglo-American history of the Upper Trinity River Basin has been divided into the
Frontier, Initial Cash Crop, Tenant Farming, and Agribusiness periods by Richner and
Lee (1976:125-133). The Frontier period lasted from about 1820 to 1850 and was
followed by the Initial Cash Crop period which lasted until 1870. Tenant Farming began
at 1870 and continued to about 1940. Agribusiness began after the Great Depression and
continues to this date. In addition to agribusiness, numerous wartime industries were
established in North Central Texas during World War II. These industries additionally
helped to bolster a diversified and prosperous post-war economy, which had the added
effect of increasing the regional population. Today North Central Texas continues to be a
growing area. The expansion of Dallas and Fort Worth, due to the ever increasing amount
of industries coming into the area, has extended the suburbs and it appears that retirement
communities are also on the rise.
Previous Investigations
Sites on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River have been recorded in surveys as early as the
1930s. R.K. Harris, a member of the Dallas Archaeological Society (DAS), recorded the
first sites in the area in 1936 (Harris 1936). Harris and DAS members did considerable
work surveying the Elm Fork south from Denton. Prikryl gives a thorough review of the
DAS’s fieldwork through the 1960s (Prikryl 1990:21-20). In recent decades, the DAS
attempted to relocate many of these sites, but found many of them no longer exist, due in
large part to development.
A number of studies were conducted on the Elm Fork throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
mostly concerned with buried sites in the floodplain. In 1971, a University of Texas at
Arlington survey was conducted along the Elm Fork north into Denton County, and
evaluated and recorded 35 prehistoric sites within the floodplain (Hays, Hellier and
Kennerly 1972). A survey was conducted in 1978 at McInnish Park that located two shell

lens sites, indicative of occupation and faunal resource procurement sites (Skinner 1978).
The Upper Trinity Watershed was the subject of numerous studies throughout the 1980s
and 1990s, contributing to broad understanding of prehistoric occupation in the Lower
Elm Fork Basin (Yates and Ferring 1986; Ferring 1990; Prikryl 1990; Anthony and
Brown 1994). These studies also recorded numerous sites along the Elm Fork.
Additionally, Texas Water Development Board sponsored several studies throughout the
Elm Fork floodplain in the 1970s, but no sites were recorded.
Recent studies have continued to locate prehistoric sites. Approximately two miles
downstream from the study area, ARC conducted a study of the Hackberry Creek
archaeological site (41DL383), which sits within the floodplain on the west side of the
Elm Fork (Skinner and Ferring 1999). The 1999 survey was conducted because of dam
construction on Hackberry Creek that located the Late Archaic site. Four 1-meter square
test units were excavated and ten backhoe trenches were dug to depths of up to 3.5
meters. These resulted in the recovery of numerous artifacts including lithic debris, faunal
remains, and human remains. Lithics included various projectile points knapped from
both chert and quartzite, large cores and bifaces likewise made from both chert and
quartzite, and other stone tools such as metates and hammerstones. Faunal remains
included various types of animal bone, some burned or processed into tools, and
approximately 150 mussel shells, none of which showed signs of heating. Human
remains included several fragments of human long bone and one dental crown. They
were ascertained to be at least 200 years old due to weathering and decay. The survey
defined and recorded the boundaries of the site, and did not recommend any further
investigation or consideration of the site for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
East of the study area, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI) conducted an Environmental Assessment
in anticipation of SH 190 between IH 35 and IH 635 (Hunt and Peter 1997). Historic
occupation site 41DL366 was recorded during the pedestrian survey component of this
study, and two previously recorded sites, including the prehistoric campsite 41DL238 and
historic Keenan Bridge site 41DL322 were revisited. In 1998 GMI surveyed Section IV
of the President George Bush Turnpike that generally runs perpendicular to the current
study area (Peter, Hunt, Shanabrook, Largent and Krapf 2001). As a result of this survey,
the prehistoric lithic scatter and game procurement site 41DL391 was recorded, while the
previously recorded sites 41DL240 and 41DL321 were relocated as well. Phase II
investigations of 41DL391 were conducted by GMI in 2001, and consisted of 13 backhoe
trenches excavated in and around the site location (Peter, Shanabrook, Cooper, Schneibs,
Dering, and Nawojchik 2002). These defined the horizontal dimensions of the site, which
measured approximately 12 x 20 meters in diameter, and is located between 3.0 and 3.7
meters below the present floodplain surface. Two discrete living surfaces were revealed.
The first, which dated to 1000 years before the present (yrs. BP), consisted of a basinshaped hearth with limited faunal material, possible onion bulbs, knotweed seeds and a
quartzite flake. The second, which dated between 940 and 700 yrs. BP, consisted of an
earth oven featuring an associated mussel shell lens, a limited amount of large faunal
remains, and a bone fish hook. Though significant, the site was not recommended for
inclusion on the NRHP or for consideration as a SAL (Peter, et al. 2002: 61).

Approximately 3.5 miles north of the study area, GMI conducted a survey of the
Huffhines Communities, Inc. property at IH 35 and SH 121, which resulted in the
recording of site 41DN529, which is an extensive, multiple occupation Archaic-age site
situated on the Elm Fork channel (Largent, Lintz and Huhnke 2004). The site appears to
exceed 100,000 square meters in size, is deeply buried, and contains burned earth features
and ecofact assemblages consisting of mussel shell and bone, primarily from bison and
deer. Due to the extensive nature of the site, it was recommended that the site could be
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, pending further work (Largent et al 2004: iii). In
2004 GMI conducted an evaluation of a road widening project on IH 35 from IH 635 to
US 380 which is located to the north of the study area (Largent, Huhnke and Wurtz
2004). Three historic sites (41DN525 through 41DN527) were recorded during the
survey, though none were determined to be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for
consideration as a SAL.
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) identified two cultural resources
within a ¼ mile of the proposed route, yet both are on the south side of Belt Line Road
and will not be impacted (TASA 2010). The first is the historic archaeological site
41DL424 which marks the location of the Ledbetter Bridge on the Elm Fork drainage
channel. The second is the Carrollton Black Cemetery south of Belt Line Road and west
of Hutton Drive. Dedicated in 1915, the cemetery was established in the late 1800’s and
contains burials of African-American community members. Scott Boswell, a Carrollton
farmer who had purchased the property in 1871, established the cemetery. Flooding of
the Trinity River has caused many of the markers to be lost, but the cemetery is
maintained by a local cemetery group. In addition, a cluster of four sites (41DL12,
41DL13, 41DL193, 41DL194) were recorded along the channel of the Elm Fork
approximately 1 mile north of the proposed alignment. A review of historic and current
maps of the area indicates the presence of a single structure as seen on the 1959
Carrollton, TX 7.5’ USGS map (See Figure 2).

Previous investigations have shown the Elm Fork floodplain has a high potential for
containing buried prehistoric archaeological resources (Hays 1972; Ferring 1990; Yates
and Ferring 1986). Prehistoric sites have been found buried in the floodplain and exposed
in the present river and creek banks as well as in the floodplain silts away from the
present drainage channels. The majority of buried prehistoric sites recorded are located
within the channel margin of the Elm Fork. Additionally, sites may be found on the tops
of low knolls in the floodplain. These settings, where encountered in the study area, are
the areas of highest potential, and include the areas adjacent to the Elm Fork and a knoll
east of the channel. Sites that may be encountered here area are generally ephemeral,
intermittently occupied hunting and/or gathering sites such as those recorded by Skinner
in McInnish Park (1978). These will likely be indicated by the presence of mussel shell
lenses, which are artifacts common among deeply buried sites on the Elm Fork.
Historic occupation is not likely to be found in the floodplain unless historic trash was
placed in gullies or on creek banks along unmapped fishing/hunting camp roads that
crossed the floodplain and have been covered by overbank flooding. One structure is
plotted within the alignment as shown in the 1959 Carrollton, TX 7.5’ USGS map
overlay (See Figure 2). No structures are shown in the proposed sewer alignment on the
1900 Sam Street Map of Dallas County or on the 1920 Dallas County Soils Map.
Methodology
The field team walked the high potential areas of the route in parallel transects spaced 5
meters apart and made thorough field notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and
disturbed areas where soil was exposed. During the pedestrian survey, close attention was
paid to the eroded banks of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, which was visually
inspected for artifacts that may have been exposed by erosion. Shovel tests, which were
placed near the approximate mapped location of the historic structure and atop the low
knoll east of the Elm Fork, were excavated according to THC guidelines (n.d.) and
averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and
broken into smaller pieces in order to determine if cultural materials were present.
Additionally, three backhoe trenches were excavated to the depth of pipeline installation
in the high probability areas on either side of the Elm Fork and on the west side of a
small unnamed drainage east of McInnish Park in order to search for buried cultural
deposits. Shovel test and backhoe trench matrices were described on the basis of texture
and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in
each shovel test and profile. Soil profiles were described following the procedures
developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs were taken using a Canon Power Shot
Digital Elph 8.0 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test and bank profile locations
were recorded with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
Survey was conducted moving west to east along the pipeline route, and began with an
examination of the Elm Fork channel (Figure 2). The channel is approximately 30 meters
wide at the proposed crossing, with running water to a depth of several meters present at
the time of survey. Stands of oak, elm and pecan flank the drainage, while sparse prairie
grasses were present on the banks. The west bank was sloping and undulating, and
exhibits signs of severe and recent erosion (Figure 3). On the slopes approaching the west
bank of the channel, which abuts a gravel parking lot (Figure 4), gully erosion had
resulted from drainage ditches that flank the developments in the area. Though the soil
profile was very difficult to ascertain, given the vegetation and debris present on the
channel banks, an isolated area of ground exposure in an animal trail revealed continuous
dark grayish brown clays and clay loams present throughout the banks’ entire height of
roughly four meters.
The east bank was similarly sloped and eroded, with concrete facings and gabions in
place for bank stabilization, particularly near where the existing pipeline spans the
channel and where a previous 33-inch diameter span was removed (Figure 5). Several
paths, probably utilized by both animals and people, cross the sloping bank. A concrete
drain is located approximately 14 meters north of the exposed pipeline span (Figure 6).
This likely drains the parking lot and low areas of the park east of the channel. The gully
created by the outwash from the drain has been utilized as a dump for concrete and other
construction debris, and accordingly a large pile of debris has built up on the east bank.

Survey continued in the cleared and manicured grounds of McInnish Park located along
Elm Fork Drive on the east side of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Ground cover
consisted of mowed grass, resulting in ground visibility of 30 percent, though isolated
exposed areas were present, which offered 50 percent views of the surface (Figure 7).
Terrain was generally level, though a slight rise was present approximately 30 meters east
of the Elm Fork channel, which corresponds to the approximate location of the structure
mapped on the 1959 Carrollton, TX USGS map (Figure 8). Although the cleared grounds
and the wooded area to the south were visually examined for structural remains, none
were observed.
Several pipelines intersect the area immediately east of the Elm Fork. The old 33-inch
TRA sewer line runs east from the meter station (shown below), and a new 48-inch TRA
sewer line is located immediately south of the 33-inch line. The ground surface east of
the channel features a latticework of concrete pavers that form an access road to the TRA
meter station, which services the current line. The paver-lined access road crosses an
existing 8-inch city park sewer line which intersects the old 33-inch TRA line from the
northwest (Figure 9 and Appendix A). Additionally, a high-pressure gas line runs east to
west approximately 15 meters to the south of the study area, and a petroleum/jet fuel line
runs east to west through the park approximately 50 meters to the north.

Survey then moved east from the Elm Fork to the smaller unnamed, intermittent drainage
located east of the athletic fields south of McInnish Park (Figure 10). This channel was
fairly easily accessible from the west out of the maintained park area, and is situated in
very level lowland (Figure 11). The channel is most likely used to drain standing water
from the now-abandoned gravel pits north of Belt Line Road (Figure 12). The drainage,
though mapped as perennial on the USGS maps, is quite shallow, and measures
approximately two to three meters in width, with less than 50cm of running water present
at the time of survey. To the east of the channel, the pipeline runs through a very
confined corridor between a series of storage buildings located immediately south of a
pistol range and the railroad track approximately 15 meters to the south (Figure 13). In
this confined space, two pipelines, the original 33-inch TRA line and the 48-inch relief
sewer, run parallel to each other with 5 to 10 feet separating them. This was confirmed in
the field by pacing off the distance between a manhole for the original 33-inch line
situated on the fence line south of the pistol range and an air intake valve for the new 48inch line located a short distance to the south. Due to the confined nature of this area, no
subsurface testing was conducted here.

Subsurface Investigations
After the initial pedestrian survey, three locations were chosen for the excavation of
backhoe test trenches (Figure 14). These included both the east and west sides of the Elm
Fork and the west side of the unnamed drainage located east of McInnish Park. Trench 1
was excavated approximately 35 meters west of the Elm Fork channel, and corresponds
roughly to the location of the original 33-inch TRA sewer line. Located in a gravel
parking lot, the trench encountered a heavily disturbed and mottled soil profile with nonnatural soil horizons and abundant fill gravels and concrete debris. The presence of this
fill and debris reflects the extensive construction efforts that have taken place there since
the initial installation of the sewer line (Table 1). A bed of limestone fill gravels was
encountered at a depth of 240 cm in this trench, and likely marks the location of gravel
fill placed around the 33-inch TRA sewer line. Excavation was stopped at this point.
Trench 2 was placed approximately 25 meters east of the Elm Fork channel within
McInnish Park. It encountered a less overtly disturbed soil profile consisting of slightly
lightening brown sandy clays to a depth of 240 cm. However, between 15 to 30 percent
fill gravel, concrete debris, bricks, and scrap metal were present in the trench fill to
depths of up to 230 cm, indicating significant disturbance to the area, which also likely
resulted from pipeline-related construction. The 8-inch city park sewer line that intersects
the abandoned 33-inch was encountered at this depth, and trenching was discontinued.
Interviews with one of the owners of the west bank portion of the study area, Johnny
Thompson, and an Encore gas pipeline operator contacted during the pre-excavation
planning through Dig Tess both mentioned that the banks of the Elm Fork at this area had
been heavily modified over the last 20 years. Specifically, the aerial crossing for the old
33-inch was removed recently and one of the gas lines had in the past collapsed into the

channel. Both of these crossings were removed, and the banks stabilized with fill material
from the old railroad bed to the north, as well as with concrete reinforcements and the
installation of gabions.
After completing Trench 2, two shovel tests were excavated at the approximate location
of the structure mapped on the 1959 Carrollton, TX USGS map. Comparable to the
backhoe trench excavated nearby, shovel testing revealed a heavily disturbed soil profile
consisting of dark grayish brown clays which darkened with depth and contained between
20 and 30 percent limestone fill gravels. Given the information gleaned from backhoe
trenching it may be reasonably assumed that these gravels result from TRA construction
efforts in the area, and not from any historic structure.
Three shovel tests were excavated on the low knoll east of the Elm Fork channel. They
located a heavily disturbed soil profile similar to that seen in Trench 2. Shovel tests 3 and
4 revealed a top layer of clay fill between 65 and 70 cm, overlaying less overtly
disturbed, mottled light yellowish brown clayey sand to 140 cm in depth. Shovel test 5,
however, encountered 130 cm of heavily disturbed clay with abundant fill material
including quarried fill gravels, some metal and plastic debris. Similar light yellowish
brown mottled clayey sand was encountered below this fill deposit. No cultural material
was found in any of the three shovel tests.
The third backhoe trench was excavated approximately 25 meters west of the small
unnamed drainage located east of McInnish Park. This trench by far exposed the least
dramatically disturbed soil profile of the three excavated along the proposed sewer line
route. Though heavily disturbed and mottled soil, concrete debris and limestone fill
gravels were present in the top 60 cm, natural sediments were encountered below this
depth. These included medium to very fine silty clays grading in hue from very dark
grayish brown to brown to a depth of 370 cm. However, no cultural resources were
located in this or any of the two above-described backhoe trenches.

Conclusions
No cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey, in the five shovel tests
or in the three backhoe trenches excavated within the proposed TRA Coppell Interceptor
Sewer Pipeline route. The most likely explanation for the absence of cultural resources is
the significant disturbance of the area. Subsurface investigation demonstrated that the
areas on both sides of the Elm Fork have been heavily disturbed and modified by
numerous pipeline installations. Indeed, backhoe trenching showed that the top roughly
two to four meters of soil adjacent to the channel and across the floodplain consists
primarily of fill. Disturbance of this area may have destroyed or removed any cultural
resources that might have been present within the study area, and the proximity of the
proposed route to the two existing TRA sewer lines places the route within additionally
disturbed soils. Aside from artificial impacts, even intact prehistoric site deposits in the
Elm Fork floodplain generally contain relatively few and widely scattered artifacts, and
rarely have distinct stratification. As such, it is unremarkable that no buried cultural
resources were encountered within the narrow confines of the proposed pipeline ROW.
Of particular note in this regard is the absence of mussel shells in either the exposed Elm
Fork banks or in any of the backhoe trenches. This further buttresses the supposition that
cultural resources are not present in the study area, since mussel shells are the most
common artifacts associated with buried prehistoric sites in the floodplain.
Historic potential was thought to be low in the study area due to frequent flooding.
Despite the presence of a mapped structure near the pipeline ROW, survey and shovel
testing confirmed the absence of historic resources, with no trace of the structure
remaining.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present within the ROW of the TRA Coppell Interceptor Sewer Pipeline route. No
archaeological sites were found during pedestrian survey of the route, or during backhoe
testing of the floodplain. AR Consultants, Inc. concludes that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted in the study area and recommends that the Texas
Historical Commission concur with this assessment. However, if buried cultural materials
are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified.
