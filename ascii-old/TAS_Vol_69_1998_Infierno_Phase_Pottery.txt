Infierno Phase Pottery of the
Lower Pecos River Region
Solveig A. Turpin and David G. Robinson

ABSTRACT
Although the Lower Pecos region is usually considered almost aceramic, small numbers of sherds have been
collected from 12 sites, most of them on terraces paralleling the major rivers or on promontories overlooking
spring-fed water holes. The vast majority of the sherds are undecorated brown wares made of clays that naturally
include some sand particles. Surface treatment is generally limited to smoothing and polishing although redslipped pieces may appear late in the pottery tradition. The most distinctive characteristic is the combination of
bone and calcium carbonate tempering material, evident as large white inclusions protruding from a pinkish-tan
paste that is incompletely fired, leaving a darkened core. This ceramic ware is an index artifact of the Late
Prehistoric/Protohistoric lnfierno phase in the Lower Pecos region. Similarities with some historic indigenous
pottery at the Apache mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz suggest the basic constituents were adapted by native
potters to the new technology of wheel-made ceramics.

INTRODUCTION
Although ceramics are so rare in the Lower
Pecos cultural area that the region was omitted
from a recent resume of pottery traditions in Texas
(Perttula et al. 1995), bone and calcium carbonatetempered, plain brownware sherds are a defining
attribute of the Infierno phase in the local chronology. Dibble ( 1978) established the Late Prehistoric
or Protohistoric Infierno phase on the basis of the
type site, lnfierno Camp, where tipi rings, or circular stone alignments made of paired limestone
blocks, are surrounded by small stemmed arrow
points, steeply beveled end scrapers, four-beveled
knives, and fragments of plain pottery. Survey later
demonstrated a relationship between tipi rings and
cairn burials that may indicate the two are contemporaneous. The Infierno phase became an accepted
division of the Lower Pecos chronology, occupying the period between A.D. 1500 and 1780
(Turpin 1991 ), although the steeply beveled end
scrapers are the only typical artifact class that has
been analyzed and reported in detail (Bement and
Turpin 1987).
Infierno phase ceramics, albeit fragmentary and
in small quantities, have been recovered from at
least 12 sites in the Lower Pecos proper, specifically

southeastern Val Verde County, although the
sources that report them are scattered and not widely
circulated. Similarities between the majority of the
sherds that have been recovered and one class of
historic indigenous pottery from the late 18th
century Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz on
the Nueces River, I 00 km east of the Lower Pecos
region (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969), suggest an
affiliation with Protohistoric and Historic migrants
who entered the region after A.D. 1500.

Figure 1. The Lower Pecos Region. The majority of the ceramic-bearing sites are on or
near the Rio Grande

shelter on the Pecos River (Figure 1). Individual
specimens from all the sites total more than 50 and
less than 100.
Of the 58 sherds reported or known to the
authors, all but three are similar in color, firing
temperature, paste, temper, and finish. The exceptions are decorated sherds: one from the unidentified rock shelter on the Pecos River and two from
Coontail Spin on the Rio Grande. The more common plain brownware may have developed into
one strain of historic indigenous pottery found at
Mission San Lorenzo. To further explore this relationship, 13 sherds-two each from the mission,
41VV11, 41VV188, 41VV365, and 41VV446, and
one each from 41VV424, 41RG26, and 41FY1were thin-sectioned and subjected to macroscopic
analysis.

THE CERAMIC-PRODUCING
SITES OF THE LOWER PECOS

Rio Grande Tributaries and Terraces
Infierno Camp has more ceramics than all the
other Lower Pecos sites added together, but only a
few were collected before the site was closed to
further study. High on an upland divide between
two tributaries to the Rio Grande and overlooking a
permanent spring, over 100 tipi rings provided the
context for an artifact assemblage that is clearly
different from the Archaic tool kit. Dibble (1978)
described this large open camp site and its artifacts,
using it as the type site for his definition of the
Infierno phase, the latest prehistoric division of his
Lower Pecos chronology. Dozens of plain

Turpin and Robinson - Infierno Phase Pottery of the Lower Pecos River Region
brownware sherds were clearly associated with
small triangular arrow points, steeply beveled end
scrapers, four-beveled knives, and circular stone
alignments that presumably served as pole supports
for brush or hide-covered structures. Based on the
highly specific features and tool types, Dibble
(1978) estimated that the site was Protohistoric in
age and served as a base camp for bison hunters
who exploited the expansion of the Plains biota
into the Lower Pecos sometime after A.D. 1500, a
supposition that is not inconsistent with the ethnographic record (Turpin 1987). The Infierno phase is
roughly contemporaneous with, but not an extension of, the Toyah phase of Central and South Texas
(Turpin 1991). Dibble thought that the Infierno pottery differed from the more generic Leon Plain
wares of Texas and explored its possible relationship with ceramics from the Panhandle.
Only a few hundred meters from Infierno
Camp, 13 sherds, possibly from the same vessel,
were collected from Black Cave Camp, an Infierno
phase artifact scatter that consisted of steeply beveled end scrapers, a four-beveled knife, and ceramics found atop a high promontory near a series of
burial cairns. The sherds were described as 2 to 4
mm thick, light tan with a darkened core, and tempered by aplastic inclusions of calcite, rounded
quartz, and black and grey rounded and angular
volcanic material (Turpin 1982:124-125). Most surfaces were roughened from weathering but one fragment had a slightly redder polished finish.
Excavations at Coontail Spin, a large rock shelter on the Rio Grande, produced two sherds that
apparently differed from each other and from the
bulk of the Lower Pecos ceramic inventory. The
larger of the two, a punctated rim fragment, was
unlike the rest of Lower Pecos sherds in paste,
color, surface treatment, and texture. The other, a
body sherd, was described as having a fine-textured reddish paste with interior and exterior
smoothing. Reportedly, its ornamentation consisted
of "two concentric arcs of small, closely spaced
punctations made with a sharp, needle-like objectperhaps a cactus thorn" (Nunley et al. 1965:96).
Unfortunately, this sherd could not be located in
the Texas Archeological Research laboratory
(TARL) collections so any resemblance to the undecorated specimens attributed to the Infierno phase
cannot be verified.
One sherd was found on the limestone bedrock
adjacent to a circular stone feature at the Live Oak

91

Hole site, a tipi ring site overlooking the historic
pictograph at Live Oak Hole on Cow Creek, a
tributary of the Rio Grande east of the Pecos River
(Turpin and Bement 1989). Slightly downstream,
on the banks of the Rio Grande below Amistad
Dam, Turpin and Bement collected four sherds
from the surface of the Brite Terrace site, a site
exposed in the walls of a borrow pit. The National
Park Service's survey of river terraces exposed
during the drought and subsequent lowering of
Amistad Reservoir encountered sherds on two topographically similar locations along the Rio
Grande (Billingsley, 1996 personal communication; TARL site files). Seven pieces of pottery, two
of which fit together, were collected from
41VV1723 and five were found on neighboring
41VV1724. One of the latter was a rim sherd.
According to Sandra Billingsley, who recorded
these sites, the ceramics outwardly fit the description of Infierno phase pottery.
Devils River Drainage
The first report on the Devil's Mouth site, a
deeply stratified, multi-component terrace site
(Johnson 1961:279), mentions three sherds. By
1964, excavations had produced six sherds that
Johnson (1964:73) described as 5 to 8 mm thick,
smooth but not polished, and tan or cream-colored
with a surface hardness that equaled 2.5-3 on Moh's
scale. The paste was said to be soft and porous,
tempered with abundant bone fragments, clay lumps
or ground pottery sherds (grog), and a small amount
of sand. One was associated with arrow points between 60-80 cm deep in Area B, and five came
from the upper four strata of Area A. The third
season at Devil's Mouth produced two more sherds,
similar to those recovered earlier but thinner. Sorrow (1968:42) described them as reddish-tan with a
darker core. The aplastic inclusions were thought
to be crushed bone with some sand. The basal sherd,
a fragment from a flat-bottomed bowl, was wellsmoothed but not polished, and the smaller body
sherd was polished on the exterior surface. Sorrow
(1968:42) states that three field seasons produced a
total of 11 sherds, but a review of the collections
and his calculations suggests that there were only
eight: three from the first season, three from the
second, and two from the third.
Test excavations at the Javelina Bluff site, an
upland open camp that overlooked the Devils River

92

Texas Archeological Society

prior to the impoundment of Amistad Reservoir,
produced 12 sherds in the upper three levels of one
excavation unit. The ceramic fragments were described as ranging in color from orange-tan to buff
and gray (McClurkan 1968:8). The specimens were
smoothed and one had a polished exterior. Temper,
thickness, or paste were not discussed but the sherds
were likened to those from Devil's Mouth in appearance and composition.
James H. Word recorded 41VV424, a terrace
site on the banks of the Devils River near Baker's
Crossing (TARL files), where he collected a fragment of a ceramic pipe and two sherds which he
described as reddish pink, quite firm, 3 to 4 mm
thick, and tempered with a white material, either
bone or crushed caliche. To him, the pottery
seemed similar to sherds that he had seen from the
San Angelo area, and material he had collected
from the Floydada Country Club site (41FL1;
Word 1963:57, 1968).
Turpin and Bement collected yet another sherd,
13 steeply beveled end scrapers, and four arrow
points from the Dolan Creek Terrace site, paralleling Dolan Creek, across from an historic pictograph, a Spanish mission scene at 41VV343.
Reportedly, the landowner also found a metal arrow point on this site.
Pecos River Drainage

An incised rim sherd in a private collection
reportedly came from a unspecified rock shelter on
the Pecos River. This fragment of brownware
differs from Infierno phase pottery in its finetextured paste, sand tempering, higher firing
temperature, and decoration. The exterior of a
simple rim was apparently encircled by a zigzag
line about 1 cm in height.
Other Locations

North of the Lower Pecos region, one specimen used in this preliminary analysis is from
Reagan County. A sherd that outwardly looked very
much like Infierno phase pottery was eroding from
a dissected sand drift on the north shore of Big
Lake (41RG26), the largest playa lake in Texas.
This ceramic fragment was generally associated
with Perdiz and Toyah arrow points (Turpin 1994).
Long ago, collectors and amateur archeologists
working even farther north recognized similarities

in sherds from sites near Abilene, San Angelo, and
Rotan that in turn are very like the Lower Pecos
complement discussed here. The pottery was
informally called Abilene Brown (Word 1978) and
presumably was similar to ceramics reported in the
1930s by Ray (1935; Griffin 1935). Word (1978)
corresponded with Dibble about the possible
Infierno-Abilene link based on the perceived
similarities, and loaned him a comparative sample
from the Floydada Country Club site (41FL1). One
of those sherds was thin-sectioned for this analysis.
In addition, one of two sherds collected during
excavation of Sotol Shelter (41 CX9), a rock shelter
in Crockett County (Lorrain 1968), may be relevant to this discussion in that it was associated
with arrow points and radiocarbon dates, although
its physical description is not conclusive. Hearths
associated with arrow points and ceramic fragments,
one of which has crushed rock temper only vaguely
reminiscent of the Infierno sherds, produced uncorrected, uncalibrated ages of 400 Â± 60 (Tx-649) and
370 Â± 60 B.P. (Tx-650). The 1-sigma calibrated
date range of the hearths is A.D. 1440-1640 (Stuiver
and Reimer 1993, Method A). In fact, a number of
sherds from Crockett and Pecos counties were reported by Rogers (1972), who attributed many of
them to Caddoan or Jornada Mogollon influences,
leaving only a few that might potentially match the
Infierno sample. However, none of these specimens
were available for our analyses.

Mission San Lorenzo
de la Santa Cruz

The history and archeology of Mission San
Lorenzo are discussed in detail by Tunnell and
Newcomb (1969). Established for the Apaches, the
mission was only in existence from 1762 to 1771
when it was abandoned and left to disintegrate.
Archeological excavations unearthed massive
amounts of pottery, including several sherds whose
description was given as "soft paste, wheel-made
earthenware" (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969:80-81).
Six sherds assigned to this group were borrowed
from T ARL for this analysis. Only one of these
evidences wheel turning, and none bear the red slip
attributed to this category (Tunnell and Newcomb
1969:80-81).
Coil undulations are visible on some sherds,
indicating that these specimens were hand-made.
The paste has a granular sandy texture and the

Turpin and Robinson - Infierno Phase Pottery of the Lower Pecos River Region
aplastic inclusions are small angular fragments of
calcium carbonate. Some, but not all, of the sherds
also contained crushed bone. On most of them, the
paste has oxidized to a light orange on the surface;
and the core is dark gray and constitutes up to onehalf of the sherd. Gross characteristics, such as the
tempering materials, paste, color, and firing temperatures, align this particular sample of sherds with
the Lower Pecos assemblage so two sherds were
thin-sectioned for the next stage of the analysis.

ANALYSIS OF SELECTED
SHERDS
Point counts of the 13 thin-sectioned sherds
demonstrate the similarities and differences within
a sample that outwardly appeared to be uniformly
one type (Table l). Perhaps typical of poorly fired,
hand-molded ceramics, the variability within any
one sherd often exceeded that between sherds from
different locations. Two l 00-point counts per sherd
were averaged to arrive at the percentages provided
in the table.
The two sherds from Javelina Bluff (41VVl1),
share smooth texture, straight fracture, and pore
space in fine and very fine voids. Both have subrounded to sub-angular and angular black to white
particles, a mixture of limestone and bone. One
sherd ( 1119) has smoothed interior and exterior
surfaces but the other (l 13 l) has a smoothed interior and polished exterior. The latter sherd is pinkish-tan throughout; the other has a dull grey core
streak interrupting its pinkish-tan body. The variety
in color and surface attributes mitigate against attributing both sherds to the same vessel but this
variability may also be the result of casual finishing
and poorly controlled firing.
Both the thin-sectioned sherds from the Devils
Mouth site (41VV188), have pinkish to dark tan
clay bodies with carbon core streaks. Their unifying characteristic is the inclusion of fine to coarse
and sub-rounded to sub-angular limestone and bone
particles. One sherd has granular texture and wavy
fracture, and the other has a smooth texture and
straight fracture. The former has smoothed exterior
and interior surfaces while the other has a polished
interior and a smoothed exterior. Body particles
protrude from the smoothed surfaces of both sherds.
Both sherds from Black Camp Cave
(41 VV365) share irregularly-shaped pore space, fine

93

to very coarse black to white particles of limestone
and bone, a distinct carbon streak, pinkish-tan clay
bodies, and smoothed exterior and interior surfaces
with protruding particles. One has smooth texture
and straight fracture, while the other has a rough
texture and wavy fracture.
The sherd from Baker's Crossing, 41VV424,
has granular texture and wavy fracture; pore space
in irregularly shaped voids; and fine-to-coarse, subangular to sub-rounded black to white particles of
limestone and bone. The interior clay body is pinkish-tan, and its surface is smoothed; the exterior is
blackened by a carbon flare and polished.
The two sherds from Infierno Camp
(41VV446) have irregular fracture and texture that
is coarser than either Leon Plain pottery of coastal
and South Texas or Mogollon brownware of the
Trans-Pecos. The clay bodies have very small
amounts of fine sand with rounded edges, suggesting it probably is a natural inclusion. The most
obvious tempering agent consists of large white
particles of limestone, partially slaked by the firing process. Voids in the ceramic fabric are rodlike, their interior surfaces scored longitudinally,
indicating additional tempering with clipped grass
or herbivore dung. Both sherds have thick black
core streaks. One sherd has a red exterior and interior, the other is yellowish-tan. Both were manufactured by coiling; the surfaces are haphazardly
polished with a hard instrument that left polishing
marks and smeared the outer layer of clay. The
polishing action created both piles of clay and gaps
in the surface.
The small fragment of plain pottery from the
Floydada Country Club site (41FL1) has even fracture and smooth texture. Both exterior and interior
surfaces are smoothed and paste particles are visible on the surface. Paste colors range from yellowish tan to grayish-tan; the core has a wide gray
carbon streak. The paste has medium to coarse
voids and numerous medium to coarse sub-angular and angular particles that range in color from
gray to white. The sherd failed to effervesce in hydrochloric acid, the first indication that the particles
are bone or bone phosphate without the calcium
carbonate that is the key diagnostic element in
Infierno ceramics (see Matson 1935 for a discussion of these tempering materials). This preliminary finding was confirmed by the point count (see
Table 1), which clearly segregates the Floydada
sherd from the Lower Pecos sample based on the

absence of limestone tempering material and the
minor presence of chert.
The ceramic fragment from 41RG26 was very
small, about 6 mm thick, and almost destroyed by
thin-sectioning. This sherd has reddish-brown interior and exterior surfaces and a grey-brown core.
Its texture is coarse. The ceramic fabric has numerous coarse white particles and a few fine black
particles. The thin section analysis clearly isolates
this sherd based on the absence of bone and limestone tempering and the inclusion of irregular
crushed quartz rock as opposed to quartz sand, feldspars (orthoclase, microcline ), igneous silicates
(pyrozene), and unknown particles (see Table 1).
The two thin-sectioned sherds from Mission
San Lorenzo vary in a number of attributes. One
has a crazed, blocky texture while the other has
even texture. The latter has a polished exterior and
smoothed interior; the former has smoothed interior and exterior surfaces. Although both have reddish exteriors, neither is slipped. They have thick
black carbon streaks and fine to coarse white particles of bone and/or limestone as well; very fine,
well-rounded sand particles may be naturally occurring in the ceramic paste. The point count demonstrated that one of the sherds (67) was tempered
with both bone and limestone, like the Lower Pecos
sample, but the only aplastic additive identified in
the other specimen was bone.

Summary Descriptions
The sum of the sherds examined macroscopically and in thin-section indicates that Lower
Pecos pottery is predominantly low-to-moderately
fired earthenware, perhaps a variation on the
widespread tradition found in Central, South, and
West Texas and often subsumed under the generic
name Leon Plain. The Lower Pecos pottery is coilmade and fired in an open oxidizing atmosphere
with few controls. Surface colors range from orangered through yellowish-brown to pinkish and light
tan. Black and gray carbon streaks are common in
the core of the clay bodies and carbon flares
occasionally darken the exterior surfaces.
Smoothing and polishing are the most common
finishing modes, although initial brushing is
occasionally indicated by marks. The red slip
attributed to Mission San Lorenzo pottery may be a
late introduction or it may imply yet another variety
of simple earthenware.

95

Ceramic pastes are alluvial clays with
inclusions of very fine quartz sand particles.
Medium and coarse rounded chunks of hematite
are often accidentally incorporated into the clay
body. The most dramatic tempering agent is crushed
calcium carbonate (limestone) which gives the
sherds their distinctive appearance, especially when
coarse particles protrude from the smoothed an:d
polished surfaces. All of the thin-sectioned sherds
from the Lower Pecos proper contain both bone
and limestone aplastic material, a combination found
in only one sherd from Mission San Lorenzo in the
outside sample. Variability is expectable in a shortlived site such as the mission where people from
different ethnic groups entered and exited at will.
However, the use of calcium carbonate tempering
agents in the Lower Pecos ceramics and its absence
in the sherds from the Big Lake and Floydada sites
are consistent with local geology and may indicate
local manufacture.
Little is known about vessel forms. Sorrow
(1968:42) collected one basal sherd from a flatbottomed bowl at the Devil's Mouth site; a few
simple rims were noted at Infierno Camp.
Generally, vessel walls ranged in thickness from 2
to 9 mm. The Mission San Lorenzo sherds were
considered to be fragments from large jars, unlike
the prehistoric vessels. Wheel turning of some of
the plain pottery from Mission San Lorenzo
probably reflects the indigenous application of
imported technology to an old art to create new
forms and may signal the end of the production of
typical ceramics.

DISCUSSION
The typological classification of Infierno ceramics is currently limited by the small sample
size, all of which was collected from the Lower
Pecos region: more specifically from open camp
sites on the terraces of the major rivers or on promontories overlooking spring-fed tributaries. Only
three sherds, two of which are definitely different
from the bulk of the ceramic inventory, came from
rock shelters-Coontail Spin and an unidentified
Pecos River site-in the Lower Pecos proper. Four
of the ceramic-bearing sites (41 VV365, 41VV446,
41 VV828, and 41 VV869) clearly belong to the
Infierno phase artifact and feature complex with
stone circles, small arrow points, and/or steeply

beveled end scrapers. Two of these are on high
promontories; all four overlook permanent springs
or water holes.
The estimated age of the Infierno phase is
post-A.D. 1500 (Turpin 1991:36-37), a time not inconsistent with the sherds found at the eastern limits of the current sample at Mission San Lorenzo
(Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). The commonality
in gross characteristics and the combined limestone/bone temper in one of the thin-sections from
the Mission assemblage suggests that the basic
constituents of lnfierno pottery were carried into
the post-contact period by local artisans. Thus, temporal parameters of A.D. 1500-1780 are a logical
first estimate.
Speculation on the origin of the ceramic technology employed by the people who accidentally
left these few sherds on the banks of the Rio
Grande and its tributaries is surely premature given
the small size of the sample. Whether they constitute a distinct ceramic type or are more comfortably envisioned as a variety of Leon Plain produced
on the western periphery of the Toyah phase, it is
clear that specific similarities in paste, temper, and
finishing unite these few sherds into a useful tool
for identifying the Infierno phase sites and people
late in the prehistory of the Lower Pecos region.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Sandra Billingsley and Bryant Saner were instrumental in directing us to the unreported sherds
found during the Amistad Reservoir low-water survey. Lee Bement was the first to spot the sherds at
41VV365, 41VV662, 41VV828, and 41VV869.
Several of the thin-sectioned sherds were obtained
from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, some in the 1980s with the consent of Dr. Dee
Ann Story, and others more recently with permission granted by Dr. Thomas R. Hester. Other specimens were contributed by James H. Word and
David S. Dibble, who initiated their correspondence about Infierno pottery in the 1970s. This
paper is a logical continuation of Dibble's work.
