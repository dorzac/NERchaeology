MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed AD4 well pad (U.S
Army Corps of Engineers Project No. SWF 2011-00047) located within the Old Sabine Bottom
Wildlife Management Area, approximately seven miles northeast of Lindale in northern Smith
County, Texas. This cultural resources investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under
subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for Roosth Development Company. The
purpose of this document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in
partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and the Antiquities Code of Texas. This project was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5897.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
hand-excavated shovel tests and mechanically excavated trenches. Fieldwork for this project was
conducted from 8–9 March 2011. This survey encountered no significant cultural resources in
the project area. Construction of the AD4 well pad will have no adverse effect any significant
cultural resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26.8. Provided the project is
carried out as proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended for the
construction of the AD4 well pad. Future construction of an associated pipeline or improvements
to the existing access road will, however, require additional cultural resources compliance.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.00.08), under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for Roosth Production Company, for the proposed AD4 well pad (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
[USACE] Project No. SWF 2011-00047). The proposed project area is located within the Old
Sabine Bottom Wildlife Management Area approximately 11.3 kilometer (km; 7 miles [mi])
northeast of Lindale in northern Smith County, Texas (Figure 1). The AD4 well will target the
oil deposits of the Paluxy Formation. The proposed project area is on property under the
ownership of the state of Texas and is managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD). The mineral rights, however, are under private ownership.
Development of the proposed AD4 well will occur in two phases. The initial phase will consist
of the construction of an approximately 1.9-acre pad from which a vertical test well will be
drilled. If the vertical test well is successful, the AD4 well pad will be expanded in a second
construction phase to occupy an area of approximately 3.3 acres. A lease road will extend
southeast from the proposed pad to an existing access road. Since the specific location of the
lease road from the existing access road to the proposed well pad had not been determined at the
time of the cultural resources survey, the entire area between the access road and proposed well
pad area was surveyed; yielding an area of potential effects of 4.4 acres measuring 140 m (460 ft)
by 130 m (427 ft).
Preparation of the AD4 well pad area will be conducted by cutting vegetation with chainsaws and
removing tree root masses via bulldozer, resulting in disturbances to a depth of up to 1.8 m (6 ft).
Construction of the proposed well pad will consist of depositing approximately 30 centimeters
(cm; 12 inches [in]) of fill at the proposed location. If the proposed AD4 well proves successful,
the resultant product will be stored in tanks at the well pad location for removal via truck or a
pipeline may be proposed at a later date for permitting as a separate project. The emplacement of
a spill berm is not necessary during the drilling of the well, as a closed loop drilling mud system
will be used. As per 40 CFR 122, any storage tanks installed on site will be within a containment
structure with a secondary containment system, most likely a berm, elevated sufficiently to
prevent floodwater from entering the containment during typical flood events. No improvements
to the existing access road are necessary for the construction or maintenance of the proposed AD4
well.

The property encompassing the proposed AD4 well pad location is under the stewardship of
TPWD and is managed under the Old Sabine Bottom Wildlife Management Area. In addition,
the proposed well pad will require a 404 permit from the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE-SWL). The purpose of these investigations is to assist Titanium
Environmental Services and Roosth Production Company with the management of cultural
resources as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915]; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852]; and the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
Fieldwork for this project was conducted from 8–9 March 2011 by Geo-Marine Project
Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Brett Lang. Melissa Green served as
the project Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation. Although no
artifacts were collected during this investigation, all records generated by this project will be
permanently curated at the TPWD Archeology Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the
project.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The proposed AD4 well pad is located in the Sabine River valley in northern Smith County,
Texas. The well pad will be situated on the floodplain of the Sabine River, which bisects the
Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). The soils of the region are
predominantly alluvium deposits of silts and clays of Quaternary age derived from the sediments
of the Sabine River. This area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950;
Dice 1943). Often referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960), the Sabine River region
supports a diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous
aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Smith County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas. This
region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the sands of the Eocene-age
Sparta, Weches, and Queen City formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The AD4 well
will target the oil reserves of the Paluxy Formation, a relatively thin Lower Cretaceous unit of
deltaic sandstones and shales that occupies the transition between the carbonates of the
underlying Glen Rose Formation and the overlying Goodland Formation at depths of 7,000–7,700
ft (Caughey 1977). Located within the floodplain of the Sabine River, which bisects the South
Central Plains, The proposed project area occupies the floodplain at an elevation of
approximately 92 m (304 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) on a slope of less than one percent
(Figure 2). Numerous small-order drainages meander across floodplain of the Sabine River,
creating a complex network of streams, swamps, and sloughs. The proposed AD4 well pad
location is situated between the modern channel of the Sabine River to the north and an
abandoned channel of the Sabine River to the south. When the Sabine River avulsed to form its
modern channel in this area is not precisely known. A natural levee has developed immediately
to the south of the modern Sabine River channel, between the proposed well pad location and the
modern channel (Figure 3). This natural levee rises approximately 2 m (6.5 ft) above the modern
channel of the Sabine River and its adjacent floodplain. Several unnamed, intermittent tributaries
of the Sabine River exist to the north, east, and south of the proposed project area. These
drainages have eroded some portions of the floodplain, resulting in incised channels in some
locations and gentle swales in others (see Figure 2). This has imparted a slightly convex surface

profile across the medial portion of the floodplain. The former Sabine River channel and areas
immediately to the north of it have effectively become the modern backswamp of the Sabine
River. These areas are lower in elevation and are often inundated (see Figures 1 and 2).

SOILS
The soils of the AD4 project area are mapped as the Gladewater series. All information regarding
the soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from information supplied by
the Soil Conservation Service (Hatherly 1993) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service
(2011). Gladewater soils are classified as very fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Epiaquerts.
These soils are very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable, and developed in
clayey alluvium. The surface layer typically consists of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay 10–30
centimeters (cm; 4–12 inches [in]) thick underlain by a gleyed B horizon of dark gray (10YR 4/1)
clay with dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations in pores and along root
channels to a depth of approximately 43 cm (17 in). An underlying series of Bssg horizons
consisting of dark gray (10YR 4/1) to light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay to a depth of 185 cm
(74 in) is common. Areas of Gladewater soils are subject to flooding on an annual basis. During
seasons of high rainfall, the water table is often within 106 cm (42 in) of the surface.

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine River supports a diverse biotic
6

community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous aquatic vertebrates and
invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae) and 104 species of freshwater fish
(Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically, include deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black bear (Ursus
americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Ulmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Uplands may harbor certain hardwoods, such as post
oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica). Bottomlands near rivers and other major
drainages are most often dominated by native bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q.
nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q. nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut
hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N. sylvatica), and sweetgum. Dense understory growth
may often be found in forest areas in the form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon
(Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana),
rusty blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive
species such as Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium
japonicum), and soda apple (Solanum viarum) have become well established throughout the
Pineywoods as well. Much of the general area is managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 112 cm (44 in), primarily as rainfall
distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature recorded in nearby
Tyler, Texas, is around 27 degrees Celsius (°C; 80° Fahrenheit [F]), and the average winter
temperature is 8°C (47°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

This chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of East Texas. Given the size of the region and the depth
and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this discussion must necessarily
be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of East Texas were the broad-spectrum huntergathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted more-restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and other
resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and raw
materials. During the subsequent cultural period referred to as the Archaic, populations generally
continued this way of life for several millennia based on the abundant nature of resources in the
Pineywoods region. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of East Texas began cultivating
starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became active in expansive
intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs. Gradually, the Archaic
lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance on horticulture and the
development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and use of ceramics became
widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural complexity for at least a
millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of extensive long-distance
trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of elaborate ritual
practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants, and the rise of societies led by
hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the foundation of the Caddo culture. Over the
last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages and continued the development of maize
agriculture and other effective methods of food gathering, processing, and storage, as well as
elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building, ancestor veneration, ritual and political
centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition, and sophisticated craft production.
A generalized prehistoric cultural sequence for the East Texas culture area is outlined in Table 1.
Detailed synopses of East Texas prehistoric chronology are provided in other sources and will
therefore not be discussed in this report. For additional information, see Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985, 1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The initial European penetration into the general area of East Texas occurred in the middle of the
sixteenth century (ca. 1542; Table 2) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish
entrada, led by Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Soto‘s death, entered Texas, probably
somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas, in their attempt to
reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). In 1690, the Spanish
introduced the first of their missions—with the goal of eradicating the indigenous religions and
Christianizing the native populations—in the Hasinai area of East Texas, but abandoned them in
1693 after failing to convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46–49). The earliest
known European to travel through the present-day Smith County area was a Spanish missionary,
José Francisco Calahorra y Saenz, in 1765, who mentioned in his journal the saline plains
(Neches Saline) in the southwest corner of the current county (McCroskey 2011).
The earliest French presence in Texas was led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who
established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the Texas coast in present-day Victoria County (Davis
and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), later followed by Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis, who in 1714 set up a trading post at Natchitoches in present-day Louisiana, and by Bénard
de la Harpe, who in 1719 began his trading post, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, in present-day
Bowie County (Harper 2002). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the
decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of buffer missions and presidios in present-day
East Texas and Louisiana (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When
France and Spain went to war over the issue, the French forced the Spanish to abandon the area

(Newcomb 1961:288). However, after the truce in 1721, the French withdraw from Texas, and
the Spanish reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
Two early French travelers through the current Smith County area were Pedro Vial and Francisco
Xavier Fragoso who passed through the area in 1788 on their way from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to
Natchitoches, Louisiana (McCroskey 2011). After briefly regaining control of the area, the
French sold it to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.
Following the sale of Louisiana in 1803, the United States considered most of Texas to be part of
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). The
first official American exploration of the East Texas region was by the Freeman-Custis
Expedition in 1806 (Flores 1984). Although the area was disputed territory, the Mexican
government, considering Texas to be part of its lands, began issuing land grants in present-day
Smith County in the 1820s (McCroskey 2011). Among those who received grants were David G.
Burnet in 1826, Peter Ellis Bean in 1828, and Vicente Filisola in 1831. The first known Anglo
settler in the county was George W. Bays who arrived on the Neches Saline in 1823. Although
initial settlement was slow to develop because of unrest with the Cherokee, some non-Indian
immigrants began to move into the area in the early 1830s. With the removal of the Cherokee
after the Cherokee War in 1839, the area was open to permanent Anglo settlement (McCroskey
2011).
For the most part, East Texas was beyond the direct range of the 1835–1836 battles for Texas
independence that took place primarily in South and Central Texas. In 1836, the Texas Republic
was born, but Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on December 29, 1845, entering
the union as the twenty-eighth state. Smith County was created from the Nacogdoches District in
1846 and named after Gen. James Smith, a hero of the Texas revolution and a well-known
military leader during the Republic of Texas years. The small town of Tyler was named the
county seat and retains that position to the present. The majority of the settlers moving into
Smith County came from Alabama and Tennessee and thus brought with them the southern
traditions and way of life. By 1850, approximately 17 percent of the county population of 4,292
was slave, and by 1860, that number had increased to approximately 37 percent of the population
of 13,392 (McCroskey 2011).

10

After the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession, since the sympathies
of most of the Anglo-American residents of Texas lay with the South. Smith County
wholeheartedly supported secession, and on February 1, 1861, Texas became part of the
Confederate States of America (Harper 2009). Several military units formed to join to
Confederate Army, and the area was used for training troops, establishing a hospital and medicine
and medical supplies, and manufacturing military supplies and clothing (McCroskey 2011). The
defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 brought about the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of
the old slave-based plantation system, a distressed economy, and the presence of a Union army of
occupation (Harper 2009).
The East Texas region as a whole began to slowly recover from the worst effects of the Civil War
with the end of Reconstruction in 1873 as the population began to gradually increase and the
railroads arrived in the 1870s. In Smith County, small industries such as a furniture factory and a
wagon factory, as well as farm produce, timber-related products, and a booming cotton industry
expanded markets by shipping via rail. By the 1890s, fruit orchards had become a primary
agricultural product, but a major blight essentially destroyed the orchards until a recovery in 1910
reestablished peach, nectarine, and strawberry production and encouraged the growth of the rose
industry. Farmers, most of whom were tenants, suffered during the Depression years
(McCroskey 2011). In 1931, however, the first oil well in Smith County was completed and
opened the original East Texas oilfield, raising land values and spurring population growth.
World War II military training centers brought additional growth and income to the area,
expanding local produce markets, which took advantage of the extensive rail system in the
county. The livestock, chicken, and rose industries flourished after the war, as tenant crop
farming declined. In the 1970s, Tyler became an emerging force as a regional medical center,
and oil and gas production and the renowned rose industry continue to provide a major economic
base for Smith County (McCroskey 2011).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
AD4 project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and excavations undertaken using the field methods described in this
chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on National Register of
Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §60.4 (National Park
Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted, as
well as the files maintained by TPWD. Review of THC records indicated that no previous
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the proposed
well pad. The closest previous cultural resources survey to the proposed AD4 well pad is 1.9 km
(1.2 mi) to the southeast. This survey, conducted in early September 1995, consisted of shovel
testing and backhoe trenching of a 2-acre area for the proposed Anderson Development
Corporation Well No. 1 well pad (Corbin 1995). A 3.4-km (2.1-mi) linear survey was also
conducted in 1995, presumably for the lease road associated with the Anderson Development
Corporation Well No. 1, but no further details were available regarding this survey in either the
THC Atlas or TPWD files; however, Corbin (1995:Figure 1) indicated that the road existed at the
time of his survey.

12

Few previously recorded archeological sites are known to exist within the floodplain of the upper
Sabine River and no archeological sites have been recorded within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the
proposed AD4 well pad. The closest previously recorded archeological site to the proposed AD4
location is site 41WD46, a possible Late Archaic through early Caddo (Titus phase) habitation
site, located approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) to the northwest of the proposed project location on the
upland escarpment at the confluence of Lake Fork Creek and the Sabine River. Site 41WD10,
another Caddo habitation site located approximately 5.2 km (3.2 mi) west of the proposed project
location, is within 150 m (492 ft) of the modern Sabine River channel. However, the site is
situated on a prominent knoll approximately 4.5–6 m (15–20 ft) above the floodplain. The
closest previously recorded archeological sites within the floodplain of the Sabine River are sites
41WD583–585, located 7.4–8.7 km (4.6–5.4 mi) west of the proposed AD4 project area. Sites
41WD 583 and 41WD584 are both low density lithic scatters eroded from depths of less than 40
cm (16 in) from the modern floodplain surface. Site 41WD385 consists of lithic artifacts eroded
from the modern floodplain within a slough approximately 2 m (6.5 ft) deep.
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural resources existing within the proposed project area. These sources include
historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record cultural resources
such as cemeteries, houses, and related features), and aerial photography. Based on a review of
these historic records and previously recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the
region in general has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent
records, however, indicates that the substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering
much of the historic landscape. Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of nearby previously
recorded cultural resources with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils suggests that
prehistoric occupation of the area was typically confined to upland escarpments and prominent
point bar and natural levee landforms near the Sabine River. Historic period habitation within the
Sabine River floodplain was minimal during the nineteenth century. Settlement increased
markedly during the twentieth century; however, no records of historic period settlement within
the Old Sabine Bottom were encountered.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
AD4 project area had a low probability of containing cultural materials based on the frequent
flooding of the floodplain setting and very slowly permeable soils that it occupies. Given the
amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it was assumed that
ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection and that
subsurface excavation via shovel testing and deep testing via backhoe trenching would be
necessary to adequately survey the area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. As per the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
accepted by the THC and in compliance with 13 TAC 26.20, nine shovel tests were excavated
systematically across the proposed project area to depths of 80 cm (31.5 in). The location of each
13

shovel test was recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system
(GPS) unit, and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon
completion of the recording process. Two backhoe trenches were excavated to determine the
likelihood of deeply buried cultural deposits being preserved in the project area. Backhoe
trenches measured 60 cm (24 in) in width by 3 m (9.8 ft) in length and were excavated to depths
of approximately 2.5 m (8.2 ft). A portion of each backhoe trench profile was cleaned and
recorded, and a portion of trench fill was inspected for artifacts.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The recognition of a ―site‖ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
vertical and horizontal spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a
site is defined as five or more cultural items of at least two different materials or functional
classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2 [0.1-acre] area); the extent of the
surface artifacts and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts are
encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive
excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation shovel
tests are placed to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and delineate a site
are typically placed at intervals of 10–20 m (33–66 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in each of the
cardinal directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or the project
area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are encountered and
contain at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is then defined within the extent of positive
shovel tests. Sites may also be defined within an area of surface artifacts or features and
culturally positive excavations, when both are present.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas
Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL)
to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database. Conversely, the discovery of
cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past
human activity and are simply documented by location and content; likewise, modern material
(i.e., less than 50 years old) representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a
site, with only location and content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. An isolated find is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of its
failure to meet site definition and its insignificance in contributing to the archeological record.

Artifact Treatment and Analysis
No artifacts were recovered in the AD4 project area during this survey effort. Although no
artifacts were collected during this investigation, all records generated by this project will be
permanently curated at the TPWD Archeology Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the
project.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a ―historic
property.‖ ―The term ‗eligible for inclusion in the National Register‘ includes both properties
formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet
National Register listing criteria‖ (36 CFR §800.2 [e]). Subsequent to the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions, the following four criteria for eligibility
are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present
in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent
the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
[36 CFR 60.4 (a–d)]

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed AD4 project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management considerations and
recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC and TPWD records indicated that no previous cultural resources investigations
have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. Archival research focused
on the historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the project area. No historic period
resources are indicated in the vicinity of the proposed AD4 well pad on the 1905 map of Smith
County produced by William A. Woldert for the General Land Office (GLO), the 1915 Smith
County soils map, or the 1960 United States Geological Survey 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) Crow
topographic quadrangle. Woldert‘s 1905 map indicates that White‘s Crossing on the Sabine
River was located approximately 0.9 km (0.6 mi) northeast of the proposed AD4 well pad. A
review of historic aerial photography indicates that little development, aside from a minimal
amount of oil and gas development, has occurred in the vicinity of the project area in the mid-tolate-twentieth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed AD4 well pad area was intensively investigated to determine the presence of
cultural resources using a combined technique of systematically excavated shovel tests and
backhoe trenches. Approximately 4.4 acres were investigated, with nine shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 4).
The AD4 well pad occupies the floodplain of the Sabine River and is covered by a mixed
hardwood forest (Figure 5). Groundcover consists primarily of leaf litter and hydrophilic grasses,
with a small stand of river cane in the northeastern portion of the proposed project area. The
topography is nearly level, with little topographic variation across the area. An existing access
road exists immediately to the southeast of the proposed well pad location (Figure 6). As per

CTA guidelines and in compliance with 13 TAC 26.20, shovel tests (STs) 1–9 were excavated in
a systematic manner across the project area (see Figure 4). In general, soil profiles exposed
within shovel tests consisted of a thin (6–20 cm [2–8 in]) A horizon of very dark gray (10YR 3/1)
to dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay gradually transitioning to a B horizon that ranged from very dark
gray to gray (10YR 6/1) clay with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) to reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8)
mottles (Table 3; Figure 7).

Two backhoe trenches were excavated to determine the likelihood of deeply buried cultural
deposits within the well pad area (Table 4; see Figure 4). The soil profile exposed in Backhoe
Trench (BHT) 1 consisted of dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay to a depth of 20 cm (8 inbs) below
surface (bs) gradually transitioning to a massive pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) clay with common
distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles gradually becoming reddish yellow (10YR 6/6) and
increasingly faint with depth to approximately 170 cmbs (67 inbs). This pinkish gray clay
gradually transitioned to a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loamy coarse sand with few gray (10YR
6/1) clay loam inclusions was encountered between depths of 170 cmbs and 230 cmbs (90 inbs),
which in turn gradually transitioned to a very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sand at a depth of
approximately 230 cmbs in BHT 1. The soil profile exposed in BHT 2 consisted of a very dark
gray (10YR 3/1) clay to a depth of 20 cmbs gradually transitioning to a massive pinkish gray
(7.5YR 6/2) clay with common strong brown mottles to a depth of 50 cmbs (20 inbs). This
massive, mottled, pinkish gray clay gradually transitioned to a massive pinkish gray (10YR 7/2)
clay to a depth of 120 cmbs (47 inbs), which in turn gradually transitioned to a gray (10YR 5/1)

Few interpretations regarding the dynamics of the Sabine River floodplain and its interaction with
human habitation during the late Quaternary and Holocene periods can be made based on the
results of this limited survey and the general lack of archeological, geoarcheological, and
paleoenvironmental data available for this region. Several research topics germane to the
archeological record within the vicinity of the project area can be investigated concerning the
probability and visibility of prehistoric (and historic) sites occurring within the floodplain of the
upper Sabine River and the alluvial history and geomorphology of the upper Sabine River itself.
The timing and cause or causes of the avulsion that abandoned the former Sabine River channel is
not precisely known. Although their nature is not completely understood, avulsions are
controlled by autogenic and allogenic conditions that serve to promote or impede the process of
channel abandonment (e.g., Slingerland and Smith 2004; Stouthamer and Berendsen 2007; Taha
and Anderson 2008). The avulsion process is highly contingent on localized hydrological
conditions and depositional histories, and the timing of flood and other hydrogeomorphological
events (Jones and Schumm 1999; Makaske 2001; Phillips 2008). Avulsions are strongly
associated with aggrading floodplains (Slingerland and Smith 2004) and factors contributing to
the likelihood of an avulsion include the aggradation of channels and floodplains, low floodplain
gradients, potential slope gradient advantages within the alluvial valley, and the presence of
paleochannels that may be reoccupied (Aslan and Blum 1999; Makaske 2001; Slingerland and
Smith 2004; Aslan et al. 2005). GLO survey records may have documented information
important in determining vegetation communities and stream channel locations and widths within
the upper Sabine River valley during the mid-1800s (cf. Perttula et al. 1986:15–25); however,
elucidating these data will require an extensive archival research effort. The position of the
modern Sabine River channel, which forms the boundary between Smith and Wood counties in
this area, has been generally static since at least the influx of Euro-American habitation into the
region. The modern channel also appears to be mature, with a deeply entrenched meandering
channel, natural levees, and several cutoff meanders along its present length. Extensive
geomorphic testing, including analysis of sediment cores, would likely be required to more
definitively determine the timing of this avulsion event.
21

Another important topic necessary in understanding the archeological record of the upper Sabine
River valley is the depositional history of the valley. Little is known regarding rates and
sediment characteristics of valley fill episodes within the upper Sabine River valley. It is
generally accepted that historic agricultural and timbering practices resulted in severe erosion of
upland soils and deposition of sandy sediments in alluvial floodplains (e.g., Perttula et al.
1986:23; Yan et al. 2010). Phillips and Slattery (2006) used dendrochronological methods in
swamp forests within the Trinity River delta to determine historic-period sediment accumulation
rates. This method involves measuring the burial of lateral tree roots, adventitious roots, and
basal flares by sediment and determining the maximum date of burial by counting tree rings.
Dendrochronological methods, however, depend on significant sediment accumulation in
relatively short periods of time. Therefore, low sediment accumulation rates are difficult to detect
by this method (Phillips and Slattery 2006). Although this analytical procedure was not
conducted within the AD4 project area, many of the trees observed there exhibited basal flares at
the ground surface (see Figure 5). Furthermore, rapid deposition of sandy upland soils into the
upper Sabine River valley during the historic period would likely have also resulted in the infilling of the former Sabine River channel. This channel, however, was outside of the current
project study area and its sediment was therefore not sampled during this survey. The brownish
yellow loamy coarse sand with gray clay loam clasts, encountered between depths of 170 cmbs
and 230 cmbs in BHT 1, is not likely to represent historic-period sediment eroded from the
uplands. This sandy deposit does not extend laterally to the location of BHT 2, excavated
approximately 60 m (200 ft) to the northeast. It could represent a point-bar, natural levee, or
other localized high-energy fluvial deposit within or adjacent to a buried paleochannel, but more
extensive and intensive testing would be required to determine its origin more definitively.
Future archeological and geomorphological studies within the upper Sabine River valley could
investigate the utility of determining rates of deposition and landform evolution via absolute and
relative dating techniques such as optically-stimulated luminescence of sandy sediments (Murray
and Olley 2002) or the detection of historic fly ash (e.g., Jones and Olsen 1990) within the more
recent, clay-rich sediments of the upper Sabine River valley.
Soils encountered within the project area reflect a fining-upward sequence of sediments within
the floodplain of the Sabine River. The massive gleyed and heavily oxidized clays within the
upper 1.7–2.4 m (5.6–7.9 ft) of alluvial fill in the project area indicates that this area has been
most recently occupied by a backwater swamp. The potential for the occurrence and preservation
of deeply buried sites in the region is unknown, as the alluvial geomorphology of the area is
poorly understood. The few previously recorded archeological sites within the modern floodplain
of the Sabine River valley are relatively shallow, with sites 41WD583 and 41WD584 within the
uppermost 40 cm (16 in) of the modern floodplain surface. These sites, however, are located a
significant distance (7.4–8.7 km [4.6–5.4 mi]) away and on the opposite side of the modern
Sabine River channel from the proposed project area.
No artifacts were encountered on the surface or in any excavations within the proposed AD4
project area. This cultural resources survey encountered no cultural resources, as defined under
36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8. The area affected by the
AD4 well pad holds a very low probability of containing significant cultural resources.

22

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources at the
proposed AD4 well pad location and to provide adequate and relevant information for use in the
management of cultural resources within the project area. No previously recorded archeological
sites are within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area. All shovel tests and backhoe trenches were
found to be negative for artifacts and other cultural materials. No historic properties as defined
under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during
this cultural resources investigation of the project area. Based on the results of this survey, it is
recommended that construction of the proposed AD4 well pad will not adversely affect any
significant cultural resources. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, it is
recommended that no further cultural resources investigation is necessary at the proposed AD4
well pad location. If construction of an associated pipeline or improvement to the existing access
road is deemed necessary at a later date by Roosth Development Company, it is recommended
that those areas be subjected to an intensive cultural resources survey, including shovel testing
and backhoe trenching, prior to permitting. Archeological and geomorphological data collected
during any future linear surveys associated with the AD4 well pad within the Old Sabine Bottom
WMA would contribute information important to understanding the processes and timing of
landscape evolution during the late Quaternary and Holocene periods. A more complete
understanding of these processes would have a significant impact on our current understanding of
the archeological record in the upper Sabine River valley.
