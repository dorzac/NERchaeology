The 1989 TAS Field School:
Devils River State Natural Area

Solveig A. Turpin and Michael W. Davis

ABSTRACT
The 1989 Field School of the Texas Archeological Society concentrated
on broad area survey of the newly acquired Devils River State Natural Area, a
8900-ha (22,000 acre) property of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department on
the east bank of the Devils River in Val Verde County. The field school
identified 239 cultural properties in the 6,880 ha (17,000 acres) they surveyed;
of these 239 properties they tested two rockshelters, two shaft caves, and two
open campsites. The newly formed TAS rock art recording crew documented
eight pictograph sites, developing procedures appropriate for a much broader
effort planned for coming years. The data gathered by the field school contributed to comparative site locational studies that helped in identifying environmental and cultural factors that have affected settlement patterns across space
and through time in the Lower Pecos region.

INTRODUCTION

The 1989 Field School of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) was held
in Val Verde County at the Devils River State Natural Area (DRSNA), then
newly acquired by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) as a nature preserve. The natural area encompasses about 8,900 ha (22,000 acres) of
the old Fawcett Ranch, extending north and east of the Devils River from Dolan
Springs (Figure 1), the well spring that is the source of much of the river’s flow.
Previous archeological research demonstrated that the DRSNA has been
occupied throughout prehistory by hunters and gatherers who exploited the wide
range of habitats in the dissected landscape (Marmaduke and Whitsett 1975).
The TPWD, anticipating the need to inventory the cultural resources of the
preserve, cosponsored the field school, providing an opportunity for members
of the TAS to get experience in the Lower Pecos region. The work was authorized
by Texas Antiquities Permit 758, issued to the TAS and TPWD, and all materials
recovered by the field school are curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin.

LOWER PECOS ENVIRONMENTAL
AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Several authors (Story and Bryant 1966; Bryant 1969; WiUiams-Dean 1978)
have described the Lower Pecos environment, so it will be only briefly summarized
here in reference to the DRSNA and where it is pertinent to the archeological and
historic record. The report of the Devils River-Dolan Creek Natural Area Survey,

Turpin and Davis ~ 1989 TAS Field School

published in 1975 by The University of Texas at Austin (Marmaduke and Whitsett
1975), specifically deals with the DRSNA and its environs.
The thick bedded limestone of the Devils River Formation is exposed over the
greater part of the DRSNA. The bedrock along much of the Devils River-limestones of the Devils River Formation--is less resistant than limestones of the
same formation along the Pecos River and the Rio Grande. In some parts of the
DRSNA, most specifically along Dolan Creek, the limestones contain more
dolomite, which makes them more susceptible to weathering. This contributes to the
inability of the bedrock to sustain deep overhangs, prevents the formation of large
rockshelters, and contributes to the rapid deterioration of rock art painted on their
surfaces (Caran 1989). Thin clay remnants of the Del Rio Formation that cap the
upland t~ts provide suitable surfaces for open campsites. The low, domed residues
of Buda Limestone that are common along the Pecos River and the Rio Grande have
been eroded completely away in the Devils River area above the northern limits of
Lake Amistad.
Topographically, the DRSNA is a fiat tableland dissected by entrenched
tributaries that eventually reach the Devils River on the western periphery of the
natural area. Local relief is 100 to 120 meters (330 to 390 feet), with some unbroken
cliffs such as Yellow Bluff towering to as much as 66 meters (220 feet) (Deal 1975).
Bisecting the DRSNA is Dolan Creek, a broad gravel-strewn intermittent stream
bed that becomes perennial below Dolan Springs, just about 1.5 km above its
confluence with the Devils River. The DRSNA includes short, steep canyons such
as Turkey Track and Escondido, longer, more gently inclining drainageways such
as East and Speed canyons, and long, deeply entrenched rugged canyons such as
Rough Spring. Vertical relief has had an important effect on the prehistoric use of
the landscape.
Most of the flow of the Devils River comes from springs, beginning with a large
ojo de agua, Pecan Springs, on the Hudspeth River Ranch north of the DRSNA.
Above that, the river flows, floods, and dries in accordance with the runoff in its
watershed. It has been estimated that 75 percent of the flow of the Devils River at
Dolan Falls is contributed by Dolan and smaller springs nearby (Deal 1975:27).
Even in the desperate drought of the 1950s, when the springs above the DRSNA
failed for the first time in recorded history, Dolan and its companion springs on the
Devils River sustained only diminished output.
Spring water was a major factor affecting the density and duration of prehistoric
occupation along the Devils River. Precipitation, which averages about 45 cm (18
inches) a year, usually falls as heavy showers and thunderstorms between April and
October, when evaporation rates are high. Surface evaporation from Lake Amistad
is four times the annual precipitation (Deal 1975:17). Undoubtedly, in prehistory,
deeper soils and denser vegetation contributed to a higher effective precipitation
rate. According to local lore, Dolan Creek once flowed between grassy banks, not
along the mobile gravel bed that now absorbs much of the runoff before it reaches
the river (Deal 1975:28). Massive floods in 1935 and 1948 stripped away dense
stands of sycamore, oak, and pecan trees from the river and creek banks. E. K.

Fawcett, original settler in the DRSNA, claimed he could walk the entire length of
his ranch along the Devils River and never step out of the shade; now only two
groves remain in isolated pockets along the exposed limestone banks; both have
prehistoric sites. Snake Springs, a small tributary of Dolan Springs, once harbored
rainbow trout, but the stream now emerges only to disappear under mobile gravel
beds. The detrimental effect of overgrazing extends to the uplands, where flowing
springs, once centers of prehistoric occupation, are now evidenced only by travertine remnants or the density of cultural material in the vicinity.
The modern floral and faunal assemblages of the DRSNA are products of the
environmentally disruptive activities of domestic livestock. On the upland flats and
slopes, thorny brush has taken hold at the expense of native browse and grasses.
Road traffic has kept the canyon bottoms passable, but dense thicket covers the
lower slopes throughout much of the preserve. All the desert succulents that made
up the bulk of the prehistoric diet were available in the DRSNA. Hardwood trees
once lined the fiver, providing seasonal nut harvests and ample firewood, and deer
and small game were exploited throughout prehistory. Rivefine resources, such as
fish, mussels, and turtles, gave the DRSNA residents a ready supply of protein. The
addition of bison to the regional fauna during Late Archaic times is demonstrated
by remains recovered from Skyline Shelter, on the west bank of the Devils River
(Turpin 1990a) and Castle Canyon, a site now inundated by Lake Amistad (Greer
1976). Ethnohistoric reports (Turpin 1987a) and rock art depictions at Yellow Bluff,
directly adjacent to the DRSNA (Turpin 1989), also place bison in the study area
during early historic times.
Study of pollen counts (Bryant 1969), faunal remains (Dibble and Lorrain
1968), flood deposits (Patton and Dibble 1982), and ethnohistoric accounts (Turpin
1987a), has permitted reconstruction of the paleoenvironment of the Lower Pecos
region. This sequence began with the cool, moist climate at the end of the last Ice
Age and ended in the hot, dry regime of today. An overall trend toward aridity was
broken some 3000 to 2500 years ago and again in protohistoric times by mesic
interludes. One reciprocal swing of the climatic pendulum is locally identified as the
Ozona Erosional period (Bryant 1969), which transpired about 5000 years ago.
PREHISTORIC CONTEXT
Fifty years of archeological research have produced a cultural chronology that
spans more than 12,000 years of Lower Pecos prehistory and early history (Tmpin
1991a). The traditional division into Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic periods has been further refined into 12 subpefiods defined by radiocarbon
dates and temporally diagnostic tool types (Table 1). Detailed commentaries on this
cultural sequence have been published recently by Hester (1989), Sharer (1986),
and Turpin (1991a), and are not repeated here.
Considerable effort has been devoted to research in settlement patterns
(Marmadnke 1978; Turpin 1982), human health and diet (Alexander 1974; Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Sobolik 1991), adaptive technologies and strategies

and Shafer 1977; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Individual surveys and excavations are
too numerous to list here, but of direct relevance to the field school is Marmaduke
and Whitsett’s (1975) Natural Area reconnaissance, the only published account of
archeological research in the DRSNA. North of the study area, excavations at Baker
Cave (Word and Douglas 1970; Hester 1983; Chadderdon 1983; Brown 1991)
demonstrated an occupational sequence spanning 10,000 years. Publications to date
emphasize the Early Archaic component of Baker Cave, but future research will
explore a multitude of problems regarding regional adaptation (Brown 1991). On
the west bank of the Devils River, just below the DRSNA, the deep deposits of
Skyline Shelter have contributed data on economic strategies (Turpin 1990),
mortuary practices (Turpin 199 lb), human health and diet (Powel11991), and lithic
traditions (Turpin and Bement 1991), although analyses are far from complete.
Skyline Shelter is one of the few rockshelters in this region where seasonality, in this
case winter occupation, can be demonstrated. The people who lived in the DRSNA

6

probably followed much the same subsistence strategies as did the occupants of
Skyline Shelter, who relied heavily on fish, mussels, and turtles, which were
available nearby in the Devils River.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The first Europeans to set foot in what came to be called the Devils country were
members of Gaspar Castaflo de Sosa’s entrada in 1590 (Schroeder and Matson
1965). Although several Spanish expeditions penetrated north of the Rio Grande in
the 250 years of their hegemony, none produced the ethnographic detail found in
sources on neighboring regions, such as Cabeza de Vaca (Campbell 1979). At f’trst,
the Jumanos and Cibolas were the most common peoples mentioned in Spanish
documents. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680--1690, the Apache apparently took
control of the region, but they were soon succeeded by Comanche and Kiowa raiders
who travelled south from their bases on the Red River to harvest booty from
northern Mexico. Foes of the Plains Indians and Texans alike, in the nineteenth
century the Kicka~s raided northward across the Rio Grande from their homes
near the colonial settlement of Santa Rosa, now the modem town of Musquiz, in
Coahuila.
Spanish forays into the Lower Pecos River region were often hurriedly
launched pursuits of raiding Indians rather than colonizing expeditions. The area
was not thoroughly explored or mapped until after the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico in 1849. Immediately after this
peace accord was signed, American surveyors and engineers went into the field
to map the border between Mexico and the United States and to seek a route to
Santa Fe and on to California. The leader of one of the first American expeditions, famed Texas Ranger Jack Hays, gave the Devils River its English name-the Spaniards had called it the Rio de las Lajas (Schroeder and Matson
1965)--and later the San Pedro (Hayes commented that it more likely belonged
to the Devil [Greer 1952]). Despite Hayes’s unfavorable opinion of this route,
they forged ahead with a road leading northward from San Felipe Springs (Del
Rio), along the Devils River, then westward to the Pecos and on to El Paso. The
San Antonio-San Diego mail route was established in 1853 (Austerman 1985).
Military activity increased in an attempt to protect travelers and settlers, and, in
1853, Fort Clark was established squarely athwart the Comanche Trace; in 1857,
Camp Hudson was built overlooking Bakers Crossing, a major ford of the Devils River. Local tradition has it that Dolan Springs and Dolan Creek were named
for an army lieutenant, but his role in their discovery or exploitation is unclear
(Finegan, 1989 personal communication). When the Civil War intervened, the
redirection of military force opened the way for the intrusive Plains Indians, who
regularly travelled through the Devils River country to raid the settled villages
and ranches of Coahuila. The war behind it, the U.S. Army turned to the task of
pacifying the west, and several notable battles were fought on the Devils River,

but their locations are only conjectural. One confrontation between the Second
Cavalry and Comanches took place in 1857 on a bluff overlooking the Devils
River (Fehrenbach 1983:426-427); military buttons and other accoutrements
found in Snake Springs Canyon at the base of Yellow Bluff near Dolan Springs
are attributed to that battle, but the area was swept clean in the flood of 1975,
so proof is not forthcoming (Finegan, 1989 personal communication). In 1881,
the Southern Pacific Railroad opened the way for settlement, bringing goods
and providing the means for getting products to market.
In 1883, a young herder, Erasmus Keyes Fawcett, arrived on the Devils
River, pushing a herd of sheep and earning $15 a month (Turpin 1987b, 1990b).
He took up residence in a rockshelter overlooking the river while he built a cabin
and began to accumulate land ~urpin 1990b). When he married Frances Baker,
of Baker’s Crossing, in 1902, they moved the ranch headquarters to its present
location on Dolan Creek, north of the current boundary of the DRSNA. There,
all the headquarters functions of a small hamlet and large ranching operation
were fulfilled by a cluster of workers’ houses, school, cemetery, commissary,
truck garden, smithy, shearing pens, dip tank, pig, cattle, and wool barns, and
myriad specialized work areas. When the 24,290 ha (60,000 acre) spread was
divided among the descendants of Frances and E. K. Fawcett, the portions now
included in the DRSNA were inherited by son Lee and daughter Brancie Finegan,
with about 160 ha (400 acres) directly surrounding Dolan Springs held in irrevocable trust for the entire family. The Finegans operated their Dolan Creek
Ranch as a ranch and hunting preserve for many years prior to its acquisition by
TPWD.
Although the Fawcett Ranch was one of the first large sheep operations on
the Devils River, all of the early structures are just outside the perimeter of the
DRSNA. The rockshelter where E. K. Fawcett, patriarch of the family, first lived
and the log cabin he built, which subsequently burned (Turpin 1987b), are south
of Dolan Springs and north of the confluence of Dolan Creek and the Devils
River. The ranch headquarters, which presents an almost complete picture of
the development of the west Texas sheep industry, is beside the main road just
a few hundred meters north of the DRSNA gate.
GOALS OF THE FIELD SCHOOL
The primary goal of the field school was to identify the nature and
distribution of prehistoric and historic use of the rugged terrain of the DRSNA.
To accomplish this goal, TAS carried out limited testing at two rockshelters, a
creek terrace site, an upland site, a vertical shaft cave, and, after the field
school, a horizontal shaft cave, to determine their age, function, and roles in the
community patterning of the region. A newly organized TAS rock art recording
crew documented eight pictograph sites, developing methods and skills for later
application at other endangered pictograph sites.

Texas ArcheologicalSociety
Survey

The survey of the DRSNA was of particular scientific importance because the
area consists of 8,900 ha (22,000 acres) that sample a wide variety of
microenvironments, ranging from the riverine zone paralleling the Devils River to
the uplands, remote from any source of permanent water. This diversity results from
the dissected nature of the terrain, which provides different habitats in close vertical
proximity. Access to diverse resource zones is a major factor influencing the
location of sites in this region (Turpin 1982) so, for the purposes of this survey, the
DRSNA was divided into riverine, canyon bottom, canyon rim, and upland zones.
Variability within these broad categories is effected by the unpredictable influence
of springs, tinajas (pot holes), steep bluffs, and chert outcrops, all of which affected
the configuration of prehistoric exploitation patterns.
The DRSNA offered the first opportunity to compare the results of a broad area
survey in the Devils drainage with the settlement pattern previously established by
similar efforts in the Rio Grande and Pecos drainages. Toward that end, a site
typology was created so the nomenclature used on the field school survey forms
would agree with what had been used in Seminole Canyon (Turpin 1982) and other
areas along the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The results of the survey have been
divided into seven categories: rock art (pictographs and petroglyphs), rockshelters
(including caves), burned rock features (middens and hearths), stone alignments
(cairns and rings), lithic procurement (quarries and chipping stations), lithic
scatters, and historic sites.
The TAS field school divided the DRSNA into 12 roughly equal areas,
designated A through L and defined by pasture fences. To compensate for travel
time, the roughly equal areas diminished in size with distance from the field school
headquarters. A windmill in each area served as a landmark and a meeting place in
the event of crew dispersal during the day. Designated crew chiefs were responsible
for coordinating activities and reporting their day’s findings to the survey supervisor, Michael W. Davis. Workers in the field laboratory, set up in the former Finegan
Ranch hunting lodge, processed each day’s site forms and artifacts and plotted
acreage surveyed and site locations on a master map.
Due to restrictions imposed by TPWD biologists that placed the nesting habitat
of the black-capped vireo off-limits to archeologists, the crews surveyed only about
6,880 of the total 8,900 ha (17,000 of the total 22,000 acres) in the DRSNA. The
areas omitted were generally gentle, somewhat bushy slopes near the central
campground with the result that this area may be underrepresented in the site
inventory; known sites in this habitat were not revisited.
When the field school began, 54 sites had been recorded within the boundaries
of the DRSNA, 24 of them by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975), who reconnoitered
the area as part of the Devils River Natural Area Survey. The largest block of sites
(28) was recorded during visits to the Fawcett Ranch by Turpin and Bement in the
late 1980s. The field school recorded an additional 187 sites, bringing the DRSNA
total to 239, of which six are Euro-American and 233 are Native American in origin.

Rock Art Sites
41VV207,209,527,888,889,915,921,922, 1082, 1087, 1088,1105, 1145
Three rockshelters containing some form of art, a shaft cave replete with
incised lines, and one unusual figure abraded into a canyon wall were recorded
by the field school surveyors, bringing the total within the DRSNA to 13. The
first two pictograph sites, 41VV207 and 41VV209, as well as other sites in the
vicinity, were recorded by Jim Barkes in 1973 (see also Marrnaduke and Whitsett
1975). Both are rockshelters with deteriorated Middle Archaic-age Pecos River
style panels, including large red panthers (Figure 2) and various shaman figures; both overlook major tributaries of the Devils River. The next pictograph
site to be documented was 41VV527, found by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975:
88-89) during their natural area survey in 1975. This site was in the heart of the
nesting habitat of the black-capped vireo, so the rock art recording crew documented the remnant art on a later volunteer trip to the DRSNA. It too is a deteriorated Pecos River style panel in a shelter that evidences long-term occupation
(Marmaduke and Whitsett 1975).
Lee Bement and Solveig Turpin recorded rock art sites 41 VV888, 41 VV889,
41VV915, 41VV921, and 41VV922 in 1985. All have Pecos River style pictographs, and all but one are badly deteriorated. The exception, 41VV888, has four
extremely clear shaman figures (Figure 3), some miscellaneous compositions, and
a rare Red Linear hunting scene (Robinson 1989), reconstructable because of its
similarity to more intact vignettes at 41VV612, downstream on the Devils River.
Despite the obvious intensity of ritual activity in these locations, 41VV888 and its
sister site, 41VV889, are remote from the areas expected to have had high
population density. They overlook a dry tributary of Rough Spring Canyon, far from
its confluence with the river.
Another pair of related rock art sites, 41VV921 and 41VV922, are high in a
bluff overlooking the broad floodplain of Dolan Creek, on the same stream course
but above the similarly situated sites 41VV209 and 41VV527. Farther east, on
another dry tributary, 41VV915 is unusual in that the many figures lining the shelter
wall have been scratched almost to obliteration, probably in antiquity, making most
of them unintelligible. One possible blanket design in 41VV915 is the only example
of the Late Prehistoric Bold Line Geometric style found in the DRSNA (Turpin
1986).
The five sites recorded during the field school introduce considerable variety
into the regional rock art inventory. Only two 41VV1082 and 41VV1105---are
typical Pecos River style panels. Miniature red deer and remnant dots of red paint
are all that remain in 41VV1082, but 41VV1105 has six to eight anthropomorphic
figures. One can be identified as a rabbit-eared shaman, a motif found in abundance
along the Rio Grande at Rattlesnake Canyon and Abrigo Diego, and far to the south
in the Sierra del Carmen at Sin Nombre (Turpin 1991c). Neither site had much
cultural material.

The remaining three newly recorded rock art sites are unusual. Shield Shelter,
41VV1088, has only one composition--a circle encompassing 27 to 30 crescents
and surrounded by a wavy line (Figure 4). The design is unlike any other pictograph
in this region and conforms to none of the defined styles. Symbolically, the
semicircular elements may represent horseshoes contained within a circular corral
or moons enclosed within the sun (Turpin 1991d). The Plains-like theme and the
metaphorical range of this panel suggest that it is historic or protohistoric in age,
produced by an artist from one of the intrusive groups that travelled through the
Lower Pecos region between 1700 and 1885.

Another site that may well be of historic age is 41VV1087, where a human
figure was created by scraping the dark manganese stain from an exposed section
of canyon wall on a minor tributary far from the river. This site cannot be dated by

stylistic or other means, but it is so unlike any other Lower Pecos rock art that it may
well be the product of an idle hunter or sheepherder rather than the intentional
construct of a prehistoric artist.
The last newly recorded site is classified as a rock art site, although its design
elements are more often considered functional or random. Site 41VV 1145 is a
horizontal shaft cave 120 cm (4 feet) in diameter that extends into the bedrock
low in the wall of Rough Spring Canyon, a major dry tributary of the Devils
River. The entrance is replete with cut marks often construed as sharpening
grooves, dulling grooves, or hide-working scars or, more imaginatively, as Ogam
writing. The cave was at first thought uninhabitable for any length of time due
to its small size and potential for flooding, but test excavations in the mouth of
the cave, carried out after the field school by Michael W. Davis and TAS volunteers, produced lithic debris and dart points characteristic of the Middle and
Late Archaic periods. A probe dug into the interior of the shaft recovered only
one bone fragment of undetermined species and origin. The site has been classified here as rock art because the cut marks extending onto the ceiling and sides
of the shaft must have been executed from a reclining or crouching position, an
unlikely posture for utilitarian activities. Other shaft caves such as this have
proven to be burial vaults where bundled corpses were placed to decompose
naturally (Collins 1969; Turpin 1991b). The cut marks in 41VV1145 fulfill one
criterion for classification as ritual art--redundancy--and suggest that this shaft
had cultural or psychological significance in the ideological system of prehistoric people who inhabited the DRSNA (Turpin 1991b).
Rockshelters

1114-1116,1119,1132,1134,1137-1138,1157-1158,1166,1175-1176,
1178-1180, 1187-1188, 1240

Fifty-three rockshelters (including nine of the rock art sites discussed above)
have been recorded within the boundaries of the DRSNA, 33 of them by the TAS
(Figure 5). Most are small shelters whose very sparse cultural materials are often
restricted to the talus cones that spill down the canyon in front of the openings. Steep
bluff faces overlooking Dolan Creek are pocked with cavities produced by erosion
and collapse along bedding planes. This series of shelters was occupied with
varying degrees of intensity depending largely on size. Densely occupied sites such
as 41VV922 are often flanked by smaller rockshelters with extremely sparse
cultural deposits.
Another factor affecting the use of available shelters is proximity to water. Sites
such as 41VV871, near the permanent spring in Rough Spring Canyon, manifest
much more diversity and duration of use than is evident in shelters of similar size
that are far from reliable water sources. This obvious correlation suggests that sites

such as 41VV889 and41VV915, where there was an apparent concentration of both
occupation and ritual activity, were once supplied by water sources that are now lost
to increasing regional aridity.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered during the survey of the
rockshelter sites do little to define their periods of occupancy. Only 10 dart points
and arrowpoints of recognizable type and age were collected; this sample includes Middle Archaic Pedernales, Pandale (two), and Langtry (two) dart points;
Late Archaic Ensor (two) ~igure 6), Castroville, and Montell dart points; and
a Perdiz arrowpoint. It should be remembered here that commercial artifact
collecting was one of the advertised attractions of the Dolan Creek Ranch before it was acquired by TPWD. Rockshelters, with their obvious potential for
cultural deposits, would have attracted the attention of hunters who, in their idle
moments, sought relics as well as trophies. The rock art styles in these sites are
also Middle Archaic to Historic in age, reflecting the same broad time periods
as the projectile points. Excavation of two sites, 41VV209 and 41VV889, added
Late Paleoindian artifacts to the rockshelter inventory.
During the course of DRSNA development, TPWD should be aware that
three of the small, sparsely occupied shelters were considered possible burial
locales by the TAS surveyors. This potential could be verified only by testing
sites 41VV920, 41VV1111, and 41VV1132, which is not recommended at this
time. However, although none of these sites outwardly appears attractive to relic
hunters, they should be protected against vandalism. Some vandalism has occurred at all of the larger rockshelters with potentially stratified deposits, but
the information in the remaining deposits at 41VV209, 41VV870, 41VV889,
41VV915, and 41VV922 mandates their special consideration.
Caves
Only two true caves have been recorded in the DRSNA. The largest
underground cavern, Fawcett’s Cave, has been known to spelunkers for decades
and was mapped as part of Deal and Fiesler’s (1975:30) Devils River Natural
Area Survey. The Texas Speleological Society returned to Fawcett’s Cave to
refine their map and to inventory the bat population just before the land was
purchased by the TPWD. Testing of the talus cone during the 1989 field school
yielded human and animal skeletal material and a Frio dart point, confirming
its status as an archeological site, 41VV999. The testing is reported in more
detail below.
A horizontal shaft cave, 41VV1145, was discovered during the field school
low in the wall of upper Rough Spring Canyon. The most obvious evidence of
prehistoric use of this site is the myriad cut marks that surround the 120 cm (4
foot) diameter opening. After the field school, a volunteer crew headed by
Michael W. Davis made several visits to the DRSNA to clear up a few unfinished details and to test the site. The results are reported below (see heading
441V 1145, Horizontal Shaft Cave, Rough Spring Canyon).

1237, 1238, 1241-1245 ¯
These 112 sites, 21 of which had been previously recorded, were classified
primarily according to the nature of the burned rock that defined them. Of these, 71
have one or more burned rock middens, some with accompanying hearths and all
with additional burned rock scatter. An additional 13 sites are characterized by
individual hearths, rather than by middens. In another 28 sites, burned rock is
scattered across the site, but its original configuration can no longer be determined
due to postdepositional disturbances.
The burned rock middens are occasionally associated with rockshelters, tipi
rings, or quarries, but, overall, they are found in three topographic settings--the
banks of intermittent streams, canyon bottoms, and upland divides. This pattem
reflects prehistoric preferences for flat, relatively open cooking areas with easy
access to specific resource zones (Figure 7). Middens and hearths line the banks of
intermittent streams such as Rough Spring Canyon or Dolan Creek and its longer,
less precipitous tributaries, Speed, Jesus, and East canyons. Forty-two burned rock
middens, 12 isolated hearths, and nine burned rock scatters were recorded in the
canyon bottoms. Within this zone, confluences and limestone benches that have
retained enough sediment to provide soft, grass-covered surfaces are favored. The
sites in this setting are often badly disturbed by overbank flooding and by roads that
follow the creeks along these landforms.
The Devils River forms only a small segment of the western perimeter of the
DRSNA, so the TAS survey crew found only two riverine sites, one of which
(41VV974) was tested. However, further surveys along the river made before and
after the field school recorded extremely large camps on both banks of the river at
the mouths of virtually every tributary. The sites often support large oak groves, and,
not surprisingly, modem fishing camps have been built in many of these shady
spots. Most of the sites have also been affected by episodic flooding of the river, but
enough remains of them to confirm that this setting was optimal for long-term and
repetitive habitation throughout prehistory.
An unanticipated finding of the DRSNA survey was the number of large,
complex midden sites found on the high, flat upland divides, remote from the more
obvious sources of permanent water (Figure 7). Twenty-nine burned rock middens,

one isolated hearth, and 18 dispersed scatters were recorded in the upland zone
where only minor topographic influences on their locations were discernible. In four
cases, the middens are directly above small rockshelters, but no direct relationship
can be demonstrated. In another six instances, the middens are adjacent to or on chert
outcrops that provided ready access to raw material for the manufacture of stone
tools. The larger and more complex midden sites may have been so situated as to
take advantage of water in natural potholes (locally called tinajas, pots), depressions that trap water and air-borne sediments that silted them in and obscured their
obvious role in settlement patterns. This source of fill, which has long been used for
raising or repairing ranch roads and the railroad, has resulted in the borrowing and
transport of burned rock to incongruous places. A good example is 41 VV964, where
the silted-in tinajas were emptied to build the nearby airstrip. A similar proximity
to upland water sources, albeit temporary, was noted at 41VV 1075 and 41VV 1076
in the DRSNA.
From the information gathered by the survey, it was found that 49 of the 112
burned rock sites yielded temporally diagnostic tools, which, in turn defined 62
components (Figure 6). Late Archaic styles dominate the projectile point inventory,
identifying 31 sites with components attributable to that time period: 21 from the
Blue Hills subperiod, three from the Flanders subperiod, and seven from the Cibola
subperiod. Four sites had Early Archaic occupations, the Middle Archaic is
represented by 15 San Felipe and two Eagle Nest period components, and there are
five Late Prehistoric components. The assignment of another six sites only to the
general Archaic is based on the recovery of dart point fragments. No preference for
upland or lowland topographic settings during any specific time period was
apparent, other than the obvious association between long-term use and readily
available water, whether it was from springs, rivers, or tinajas. However, the
dominance of Late Archaic Blue Hills types, followed in frequency by Middle
Archaic San Felipe period styles, mirrors the general regional trend demonstrated
by excavations of rockshelters (Turpin 1990c:Figure 10.12) and earlier settlement
pattern studies (Marmaduke 1978; Turpin 1990c:Figure 10.11).
Quarries, Lithic Procurement, and Lithic Reduction Sites

Sites with Middens: 41VV872, 986, 1065, 1109, 1149, 1163
Abundant raw material for the manufacture of stone tools is readily obtainable
from three sources in the Lower Pecos River region: ancient gravel beds now
exposed by erosion, redeposited river gravels, and chert inclusions that are weathering out of the bedrock. In the DRSNA, cobbles and pieces of tabular chert litter
the ground along specific contour lines in Rough Spring Canyon, along Dolan

Turpin and Davis ~ 1989 TAS Field School

Creek, and in the northeastern pastures where short tributaries rapidly descend to the
Dry Devils River (Figure 8)
Procurement of these raw materials was the sole activity at 32 of the recorded
sites; 10 additional sites evidenced lithic reduction directly related to an adjacent
outcrop; six are more complex sites primarily classified as large burned rock
middens related to raw material sources. The distribution map shows that many of
these sites are simply areas of more intense utilization---perhaps of pockets of f’megrained material in the midstofextensive, linear erosionalexposures of chert. The
lithic reduction took place on level benches that provided convenient work areas
near the source material. The typical artifact assemblage includes tested cobbles,
cores, primary flakes, and an occasional crude biface. Temporally diagnostic tools
are lacking, but it can be assumed that these sources were exploited throughout
prehistory.
These 47 sites, and the material recorded at open campsites and rockshelters,
testify to the prolific production of stone implements from the caramel brown local
tabular cherts. The outcrops and the gravels lining the banks of the Devils River
abundantly supplied the inhabitants of the DRSNA with good quality raw material,
eliminating any need for them to curate artifacts or l~ade for stone.
Rock Alignments
41VV880, 1057, 1124, 1131, 1196
Patterned alignments of limestone boulders were the dominant features at four
sites and a minor component at one (Figure 7). The first, 41VV880, was recorded
in 1987 by Turpin and Bement. Two abutting circles of limestone blocks, a burned
rock midden, and a lithic scatter are directly above Rough Spring atop a high ridge
on the narrow divide between Rough Spring Canyon and an unnamed tributary. An
arrowpoint fragment dates one component of the site to the Late Prehistoric period.
Three more stone alignment sites were found during the field school survey.
Site 41VV1057 consists of four rock cairns, two of them aligned north-south and
two aligned east-west, amid a lithic scatter on a promontory next to Jack Branch,
above its confluence with Dolan Creek. A chert outcrop and debitage extend up the
hill, and a sparse burned rock scatter trails down the slope toward the creek. Two
burned and battered Ensor dart points date one occupation of the site to the Late
Archaic period.
On the interfluvial divide between headers of Oliver and Jesus canyons, an oval
course of rocks 25 to 30 cm high was recorded as 41VV 1124. The feature is 2.7
meters long from north to south, and 1.4 meters wide, suggesting that it was once
a cairn that has been disturbed by modern activity. Directly across a ranch road, site
41VV1104 consists of a lithic scatter that may have been connected to the stone
alignment.
A rock oval and an isolated hearth north of the Dolan Creek floodplain in the
mouth of a small south-flowing tributary were recorded as 41VV 1131. This location
deviates from the normal pattern wherein stone alignments are on high promontories.

22

23

Other sites similar to this in setting and configuration are considered sheepherders
camps because of the presence of historic trash---evidence that is lacking at
41VVl131.
In addition, one possible cairn was noted at 41VV1196, a large open campsite
adjacent to Dolan Creek at the mouth of Escondido Canyon. Its function and age are
unknown.
Stone alignments in the Lower Pecos region as a whole can be divided into two
categories: 1) structural remains, including tipi rings, where paired blocks of
limestone supported tent poles or arcs of blocks served to weigh down the
superstructure, and 2) cairns, oblong piles of rocks, that cover or contain burials. Of
course, not all rock piles of prehistoric age can be functionally interpreted, so many
miscellaneous features of unknown use have been recorded. The DRSNA examples
are generally disturbed, and theft original configurations can no longer be accurately reconstructed, but they appear to belong in the first category--structural
remains of temporary dwellings. With the exception of 41VV 1131 and 41VV 1196,
the preference for high promontories expressed in the larger sample from the Lower
Pecos as a whole is seen also in the DRSNA, especially at 41VV880.
Lithic Scatters
41VV501, 981,982, 992, 998, 1056, 1064, 1104, 1122, 1125, 1161, 1236,
1246
By definition, all the burned rock middens, hearths, and scatters and lithic
procurement sites were also designated lithic scatters. After those functional types
are removed, only 13 sites remain in this category. All but one, 41VV1056, are in
the uplands, and only that exception, 41VV1056, is a multicomponent site. This
lithic scatter along East Canyon produced three projectile points, each representing
one of the three Archaic subperiods. Three of the remaining sites were assigned to
the general Archaic period, one to the Early Archaic, and one to the Middle Archaic,
based on dart points recovered during the survey.
Historic Sites
Historic Indian Period
Rock art provides the only evidence of historic Native American occupation of the DRSNA. The iconography of site 41VV1088, described above, is not
typical of any of the defined prehistoric styles and seems more appropriate to a
historic context. Support for this age assignment can be found in two other pictograph panels just outside the boundaries of the DRSNA. At 41VV343, a Spanish colonial scene, complete with church and mustachioed caballero, overlooks
a freshet that pours into Dolan Creek just below the major springs (Marmaduke
and Whitsett 1975:Figure 3; Turpin 1989:Figure 18-3). Directly above Dolan
Springs, at 41VV485, three scenes pair bison and human figures (Turpin
1989:Figure 18-11). In one vignette, the bison is upright and has human feet,
suggesting that it is a dancer. In another, the human is armed with a flintlock,

24

proving its recent date; the third scene is blurred beyond possible decipherment.
In the same vicinity, on the banks of Dolan Creek facing the colonial pictograph,
a metal arrowpoint was collected by the landowner. Although no such evidence
has been found in the DRSNA, these sites do demonstrate a strong historic Native
American presence in the area.
Anglo-American Period
Historic water control structures: 41VV1100, 1106, 1135, 1080, 1234.
Ranch complex: 41VV 1154.
As described in more detail in the section on the historic background, the
Fawcett Ranch exemplifies the westward settlement of Texas, but most of the
early structures were intentionally left outside the DRSNA at the time of purchase by the State. The six historic sites recorded in the DRSNA are all directly
related to stock raising. Four are check dams at the heads of small tributaries,
built in the 1930s as part of a county-wide program of the Soil Conservation
Service. According to John Finegan, a small limestone block structure next to
the dam at 41VVll06 was used to store salt. A fifth water-control site,
41VV1080, is a masonry stock tank.
The central ranch complex, including sheep sheafing barn, stock pens, loading chute, wells, windmill towers, and a scatter of historic artifacts, was recorded
as 41VV1154. The site illustrates the husbandry aspect of the production of wool
and mohair, including the well-preserved ranch water system.
In summary, the historic sites are not significant entities in themselves, but,
as a whole, they illustrate the ranching system put into place by E. K. Fawcett.
The focus on water control underscores the difficulties of ranching in such an
arid environment, but stories told by E. K. Fawcett to his grandchildren describe
a country much different from what we see today (Turpin 1990b). The sheepherders had to drag a log between two horses to flatten the grass that grew so
high the sheep balked. He described Dolan Creek as a meandering stream that
ran between grassy banks, not the scoured and bleached gravel bed seen today.
Floods did not threaten the headquarters on Dolan Creek until well into the 1950s,
after denudation of the landscape by domestic livestock and an increasingly arid
climate.
A human interest thread that ties the features recorded by the field school
to the Fawcett Ranch headquarters is the masonry and concrete work accomplished by Jesus Diaz, who came to work as a ranch hand about 1912 (Finegan,
1989 personal communication). He built all the concrete structures, including
the massive barns, the workers houses, the raised garden plots at the headquarters, and the dams recorded during this survey. After E. K.’s death, when Frances
Fawcett left the ranch and moved to a home in Del Rio, Jesus Diaz retired from
ranch work, but he stayed with the family until his death. His name is perpetuated by Jesus Canyon, a tributary of Dolan Creek that heads partially inside the
DRSNA and flows past the Fawcett ranch headquarters.

TEST EXCAVATIONS
The test excavations undertaken at two rockshelters, two open sites, and two
shaft caves during and after the field school are summarily reported here. Much of
the material recovered is still being analyzed, but overall site assessments are
offered as an aid to TPWD’s area development plans.
41VV209
Limited test excavations were conducted at 41VV209, a large rockshelter that
had been extensively disturbed by pothunters, especially along the rear wall where
burials are often found ~igure 9). TPWD was interested in determining whether
intact cultural deposits remained in the shelter before they backf’tlled the potholes
in order to discourage further looting. The site was originally recorded by Jim
Barkes and first reported by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975). Kenneth M. Brown
supervised the field school testing and prepared a preliminary report on the
investigations. The following material is excerpted from his report and includes a
geological assessment prepared by S. Chris Caran (Brown 1989).
The site, which consists of three separate overhangs or galleries on the right
side of Dolan Creek, faces east from a vantage point 33 to 36 meters above the
streambed, 1.4 km upslxeam from Dolan Springs. The northern gallery is about 35
meters long, with an overhang of 2 to 5.4 meters and level floor space extending
about 9 meters from the rear wall. The middle gallery is roughly 41 meters long with

Figure 9. Rock art recording crew at work in 41VV209.

26

Texas Archeological Society

an overhang of 3.7 to 5 meters and floor space perhaps 6 meters deep. The southern
gallery is about 29 meters long, with an overhang of 2 to 4.5 meters and a floor space
7.5 meters deep. An unsheltered pour-off between the north and middle galleries
extends for about 10 meters, bringing the total length of the complex to 131 meters.
Although the protected area in each gallery is shallow, the level floors extend well
outside the drip line, creating an expanded living and activity area. The test
excavations were confined to the northern gallery, where a fiber deposit--visible
in a looter’s trench indicated that dry deposits were present ~igure 9). The
investigations focused on these plant remains with a goal of determining their extent
and assessing the integrity of the associated cultural deposits.
Geologic Setting
The lower part of the rear wall of the shelter complex is formed by a dark gray
irregularly bedded stratum of dolostone (rock consisting chiefly of dolomite)
perhaps 80 cm thick that erodes relatively easily, interbedded with more resistant
limestone beds. The top of the gray dolostone bed is marked by a conspicuous dark
red contact line (about 1 to 2 cm thick), which is a thin zone of iron or manganese
enrichment; similar but discontinuous sinuous lines can be seen in the dolostone bed
itself. In the southern gallery, the dolostone bed has a nodular-weathering sugary
texture, forming a low apron with rows of small mortar holes. Above the dolostone
stratum is a receding weathered zone, 60 to 70 cm thick, of spalling limestone that
exfoliates readily into thin roof spalls. Spalling of this zone may be due in part to
differential stress at the contact with the weaker dolostone. Above the spalled
limestone is a zone of massive limestone about 5.3 m thick that forms an inwardsloping face, and above that, about 5 meters of limestone interbedded with beds of
thin nodular chert, forming shallow steplike overhangs. Accessible parts of these
chert beds (especially along the trail to the north) apparently have been tested or
quarried prehistorically, but the chert veins overhead have also contributed a certain
amount of naatrally fractured chert breakdown to the deposits at the site. This was
especially noticeable in the lower levels excavated. A few small pieces of poor
quality petrified wood also were found in screening. These may also be natural
inclusions in the shelter fill; Deal (1975:26) notes that petrified wood occurs in the
Segovia Formation in the Dolan Creek area.
At several places in the north gallery, large slabs of rock have broken away from
the shelter wall in the prehistoric past. These are perhaps more properly termed wall
slabs than roof blocks, for they have separated from the rear wall and cut across the
bedding planes in the bea~ock. In particular, one large slab has broken away from
the rear wall behind the excavation area, and sections of the slab, mostly lying flat,
were found in the excavations about 10 cm below the surface. Whether there was
any rock art on the shelter wall before the slab broke away is unknown, but the
possibility certainly exists that rock surfaces of different ages may have been
available during the occupation. Part of the slab exposed in Unit N200/E100 had
what might have been a small spot of red paint on the upper surface. Two of the flat-

Turpin and Davis m 1989 TAS Field School

27

lying slabs had extensive deposits of fine, pure white crystals on the upper surface,
forming a crust as much as 5 mm thick. Smaller deposits of a pure white talc-like
powder were also found nearby. These deposits formed after the slabs fell and
probably after they were buried by shelter fill.
An unusual feature of the south gallery is a localized partial silification of the
dolostone stratum, which has strengthened it and made it more resistant to erosion,
creating a zone some 30 cm thick that is weathering into angular blocks and prisms.
Field Methods

With a transit, an arbitrary baseline was established in the shelter. Three 1meter squares were triangulated onto the floor from this baseline. A 100-meter
vertical datum point was established by driving a nail into the wall of the shelter, and vertical control was maintained with a transit and stadia rod (when not
hindered by the shelter wall) or line level. All excavated matrix was passed
through quarter-inch and sixteenth-inch mesh screens. With the exception of
burned rock, which was weighed and discarded together with roof spall, all
materials retained on the screens, such as chert, stream-worn pebbles, plant matter
(including twigs, leaves, and charcoal), bone, shell, and insect material, were
returned to the laboratory (Table 2). Excavation of the test pits followed natural
stratigraphy, and three strata were identified.
Stratum 1, the highest stratum, which varied in thickness from 3 to 10 cm in the
three units, consisted of gray limestone dust. The matrix was loose, possibly from
disturbance by recent human and animal traffic. Cultural materials recovered in this
upper lens consisted of debitage, core fragments, edge-modified flakes, distal and
proximal biface fragments, charcoal, bone, mussel shell, and f’tre-cracked rock.
Stratum 2, the fiber bed, varied in thickness from 5 to 14 cm in the areas
excavated. The soil was browner and more compact than in Stratum 1 and contained
a wide variety of economic and noneconomic plant remains. In one test pit, a thin
lens of fiber appeared to be slightly lower than the main deposit of vegetal remains.
Lithic artifacts from this level included large quantities of debitage, a variety of
bifaces, and edge-modified flakes. A limited amount of bone, charcoal, and mussel
shell was also recovered.
Stratum 3 consisted primarily of limestone dust and roof spall. Depending on
the density of the cultural material, the color of the matrix varied from gray to brown
to beige, with a shift from pinkish beige downward to a reddish tinge. Stratum 3 was
distinguished from Stratum 2 by the presence of more charcoal and wood ash. The
full thickness of Stratum 3 was not established, but it is at least 65 cm deep,
necessitating that it be excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels. The stratum did not
appear to contain any fiber, but chipping debris was abundant, as were edgemodified flakes and biface fragments, especially distal parts. Two mano fragments,
four metate fragments, a scraper, and a bone tool fragment were also recovered from
Stratum 3.
A small pit was identified in Stratum 3 from a concentration of charcoal lumps
and quantities of wood ash. The limits of the pit could not be defined because they

were covered by a large roof-fall block estimated to be about 50 by 70 cm, roughly
oval in plan, and slightly basin shaped at the bottom. The feature was interpreted as
a trash pit that had been filled with hearth debris from other parts of the site. Two
radiocarbon samples were taken from the pit. Two other ash deposits were
identified---one in Stratum 2 and one in Stratum 3--but were not assigned feature
numbers.
Based on the field findings, Brown (1989) offers the following observations.
Significant archeological deposits remain in place in the northern gallery where
cultural debris extends to a depth of 74 cm. The fiber zone and other deposits have
been removed from a zone about 1 to 2 meters wide along the rear wall, but intact
fiber deposits extend at least another 2 meters toward the front of the shelter,
although the front limits of their preservation were not defined by the test excavations. It appears that only one fiber zone, about 5 to 14 cm thick, remains, 5 to 7 cm
below the surface. Although preservation of plant remains is fairly good in S tratum
2, no perishable artifacts, cordage, matting, or modified sticks, were noted. Wood
charcoal was abundant, and samples were taken t0r radiocarbon dating.
The diversity of plant species is very low. Sotol and lecheguilla were not baked
in pits in the shelter, but the manos and mortar holes suggest that some seed
processing was done. The density of chipping debris is high, roughly comparable
to that in Baker Cave. Except for one possible arrowpoint fragment, all diagnostic
artifacts were Late Paleoindian to Middle Archaic in age (Figure 10). The low
diversity of plant species and the artifact assemblage suggests that 41VV209 was
a limited activity site.
An apparent decrease in the ratio of silt and clay to limestone dust with
decreasing depth may indicate a diminishing eolian component during the accumulation of deposits throughout the Holocene. Pronounced reddish tints at depth may
also be related to these eolian processes. An increase in small fish bones and snail
shells was also noted deep in one unit.
If more work is done at 41VV209, it should include extending the testing in the
northern gallery to find the eastern limits of the fiber zone, testing in the middle and
southern galleries, and collection of a pollen profile and bulk soil samples for
particle-size analysis. Testing has demonstrated that there is significant information
about prehistory in the DRSNA locked in the deposits that remain at 41VV209 and
that protection of these deposits is warranted.
41VV889, Small Shelter
High on a tributary of Rough Spring Canyon, this small rockshelter was
once one of the most extensive pictograph sites in the DRSNA, but few of the
multicolored figures are still decipherable. Amid the blur of pigment that covers
the entire rear wall are elements characteristic of Pecos River style pictographs,
the oldest of Lower Pecos pictographs. Less than 50 meters away, on the same
small drainage, 41VV888 is the best-preserved pictograph site in the project area.
There, four Pecos River style shaman figures, a Red Linear scene, and other

were probably painted by the same people who lived at one time in 41VV889.
The obvious intensity of prehistoric use of these sites led to extensive documentation by the rock art recording crew and testing under the direction of Jim Word
and May Schmidt as part of the 1989 field school.

Both 41VV888 and 41VV889 formed under the rim of a small tributary in
the dense, hard-surfaced Devils River limestones common to the DRSNA. Local variation in the composition of the bedrock is apparent in the configuration
of rockshelters and in weathering patterns here and at sites such as 41VV209
and 41VV921 along Dolan Creek. Although natural rock decay is always a threat
to rock art, the blocky exfoliation and weak structure of the Dolan Creek sites
is much less apparent at 41VV888, 41VV889, and nearby 41VV915. In addition, these sites are rounded hollows rather than the shallow linear galleries that
dominate the streamside shelters in the DRSNA. Thus, geology plays a major
role in the differential preservation of rock art and in the size and configuration
of the occupied shelters.
When 41VV889 was recorded in 1988, evidence of past relic hunting there
consisted of two depressions, a screen, and a broken shovel, but most of the deposits
a~ed to be intact. The field school crew excavated four 1-by-l-meter units in
10 cm arbitrary levels (Figure 11); the matrix was screened through quarter-inch
mesh innovatively provided by suspending the pothunter’ s reconstructed screen by
rope from above the entrance to the shelter. The site was also mapped and surfacecollected, and the excavations and pictographs were photographed.
Temporally diagnostic projectile points, ranging in age from a Plainviewlike base to arrowpoints (Figure 12, Table 3), confmn the long-term occupation
of the site. Unfortunately, the vertical sequence could not be separated into
components, probably because of the shallowness of the deposits, the sequential
but intermittent occupation of the site, and the later activities of relic hunters.
The shallowness of the deposits also provided a poor preservational environment for normally perishable items, so lithic artifacts make up the bulk of the
inventory (Table 4). Copious debitage indicates that the final reduction or rejuvenation of stone tools was a major activity. Utilized flakes, unifacial and bifacial tools, and the projectile points testify to procurement activities conducted
from a base in this small site. Use-wear analysis identified tools used in scraping (n=58), cutting (n=39), and perforating (n=l), but the specific material processed by only four artifacts could be determined. One uniface was used to scrape
hides, and four tools (three utilized flakes and an end scraper) showed evidence
that they were used for cutting and scraping plants. Two of the latter--the scraper
and one utilized flake--had the high silica sheen that is characteristic of plantprocessing tools.
The intensive use of this small part of the DRSNA, including this rockshelter,
nearby 41VV888, and an open campsite on the flats above, suggests that an upland
water source, no longer obvious, was available at least intermittently during all the
broad periods of prehistory. The bedrock depressions at the Windmill Midden
nearby are a possibility. However, the field crew at 41VV889 noted that some
water-loving plants were growing against the wall of the shelter, suggesting that
during periods of high ground moisture, seep springs may have attracted people to
this small site and its environs, which were an optimal location for exploitation of
the canyon resources below and of the upland habitat above.

On the broad, flat interfluvial divide between the heads of tributaries of Rough
Spring Canyon, Jane Hollow, and Escondido Canyon, a dense scatter ofbumedrock
and flint debris surrounds a borrow pit that supplied caliche for construction of the
adjacent airstrip. Directly north of the borrow pit is a second depression now filled

almost to the top with fine-grained sediments. The correlation between burned rock
middens and caliche pits is a common one that can be attributed to two circumstances: the soft, level surfaces of the Del Rio Clay flats were preferred camp sites
throughout prehistory, and natural depressions, or tinajas, now f’dled with wind- and
water-borne sediments, were special attractions that might well have increased the
duration or frequency of camping episodes. In other words, the caliche flats were
exploited prehistorically and historically for two very different reasons; the historic
land use often obliterated the evidence of prehistoric occupation.
Despite the obvious disturbances wrought by construction of the windmill,
the stone tank, and the airstrip, this site was selected for excavation to explore
the possibility that the caliche borrow pit was once a reservoir that held rain
water and attracted task groups to this site where they processed vegetal resources
gathered on the broad flat divide. A similar relationship between intensively
occupied burned rock midden sites and casual water sources was later recorded
by the TAS survey crew at 41VV1075 and 41VV1076.

In addition, occupation of this midden site may be related to the intensive use
of nearby rockshelter 41VV889, reported above. If the presence of a spring in the
41VV889 canyon is discounted, the Windmill Midden tinaja is the closest known
source of water for the inhabitants of several sites on this interfluvial divide.
Under the direction of Brownie Roberts and Bill Chandler, seven contiguous
1-by-l-meter units that formed a linear strip and two isolated squares were
excavated in the least disturbed part of the site, southwest of the tinaja borrow pit
(Figure 13). Maximum depth was 24 cm, with some of the units reaching bedrock
at 10 to 20 cm below the surface. All material was screened through quarter-inch
mesh; only one feature, a probable hearth, was uncovered.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered here reflect episodic use of this
location during the Early Archaic period, which is represented by one projectile
point, a Baker dart point (Figure 14, f), the Late Archaic, which is represented by
five dart point fragments, and the Late Prehistoric, which is evidenced by three
arrowpoint fragments (Figure 14, a-e). The absence of Middle Archaic-age projectile points may well be due to sampling error, considering the small area of the site
that was excavated. The remainder of the artifact assemblage reflects expedient tool
use for the same broad variety of purposes seen in the inventory from 41VV889
(Table 5). The obvious conclusion is that the Windmill Midden is the result of
episodic task-oriented exploitation of this upland flat at times when water was
available in the tinajas.

41VV974 :Spring Midden
The largest group of excavators concentrated on the Spring Midden, 41VV974-a large buried open campsite on an alluvial terrace on the left bank of Dolan Creek,
200 meters above Dolan Springs--and Yellow Bluff, about 1.5 km above the
confluence with the Devils River ~igure 15). Norman Flaigg was field supervisor
of the excavations, and Paul Lorrain led the youth group.

Turpin and Davis m 1989 TAS Field School

Figure 15. Photograph showing the youth group at work at 41VV974.

The terrace that is now part of site 41 VV974 was for a time the location of the
Dolan Creek Ranch commercial camping facility, which was complete with
underground utilities. The site was identified from dense quantities of lithic debris
and burned rock that were exposed in the cutbank of a dirt road leading from the
campground to the major pool formed by Dolan Springs. Cultural material had been
reported at each of the commercial campsites during installation of the utilities. The
site was excavated because TPWD needed a basis for making informed decisions
on the future use of this camping area and the road to the spring.
Excavations at Spring Midden were confined to the extreme south end of the
area in order to avoid as much as possible disruption of underground utilities and
of the habitat of the black-capped vireo. The excavation units were placed above the
erosional cut created by vehicular traffic, for the area was known to be rich in buried
cultural debris, including burned rock, ashy soil, charcoal, and chipped and ground
stone artifacts.
Fifteen 1-meter squares were excavated by the adults and 3150-cm units by the
youth group. The test pits were scattered over an area measuring 26 meters north to
south by 27 meters east to west; their locations were triangulated from north-south
and cast-west baselines established by the transit. Units were identified by grid
coordinates measured from a primary datum point--N50/W100--at the south end
of the terrace. A permanent vertical datum was a nail driven into a large oak tree that
dominated the western excavation area and provided welcome shade for certain
fortunate excavators. Elevations were controlled with line levels attached to unit
corners at ground level and were verified by transit readings at the bottoms of levels;

40

vertical control was in 10-cm increments. The matrix was screened through quarterinch mesh, and a limited amount of fill was fine-screened through sixteenth-inch
mesh. Most of the excavation was done with trowels and shovels, though it was
necessary to use picks in particularly hard-packed areas. Profiles of selected test pits
were drawn at the close of fieldwork.
The excavations exposed the remains of an intensive occupation in a lens that
ranged in thickness from 20 to 50 cm. The densest accumulations of burned rock
were in the southern part of the excavation area near the edge of the terrace. The
midden zone consisted of black clay loam that contained a wide variety of chipped
stone tools, considerable quantities of debitage and charcoal, and limited amounts
of mussel shell, snails, and bone (Table 6). Above the midden zone, prehistoric
cultural materials were in a thick dark brown clay. Below the midden zone was a
gray sandy matrix, ranging from 15 to 30 cm in thickness, and cultural debris that
decreased with depth. Absent from this zone were the abundant fire-fractured
limestone rocks found in the midden zone. A clearly identifiable, culturally sterile,
coarse-grained yellow sand with rounded gravels and cobbles was encountered
below the gray sand. A single 20-cm-square shovel test was excavated 65 cm into
this yellow sand zone, but the single flake and few chips that were recovered can be
attributed to downward displacement by bioturbation. All of the soils at the site are
alluvial in origin and were deposited on the site by overbank flooding of Dolan
Creek.
Aside from the burned rock midden along the south edge of the excavation area,
only one feature was documented--aloose concentration of burned limestone rocks
in Level 2 of Unit N59/W 101 (midden zone) was identified as a hearth remnant. The
feature was surrounded by loose, ashy midden soil flecked with charcoal. Secondary and tertiary flakes, chips, and several pieces of heat-shattered chert were
recovered from the level.
The variety in the projectile point inventory demonstrates that the site contains
multiple buffed prehistoric components and has been occupied for several millenia.
The Late Prehistoric Period is represented by Perdiz arrowpoints (Figurel6, a, b).
Occupation during the Late Archaic is indicated by the recovery of Ensor, Fairland,
and Frio-like dart points (Figure 16, c-e), and an Early Archaic component is
represented by an extensively reworked dart point that has morphological
characteristics similar to Bell (Figurel6, f). The absence of Middle Archaic
specimens is curious but may be attributable to sampling error. The vertical
positioning of these temporally diagnostic artifacts indicates that this part of the site
is stratified and apparently undisturbed (Table 6). This observation is strengthened
by the absence of recent or historic materials below Level 1, despite the intensive
use of the area in modern times. Unfortunately, because no unit was more than 80
cm deep and many contacted sterile matrix at 50 to 60 cm below the surface,
separation of components or identification of particular assemblages in the inventory
of artifacts would be difficult. Apparently this part of the terrace has long been a
stable landform where very little deposition has occurred. Many other chipped stone
artifacts were recovered during the exeavation---edge-modified flakes (by retouch

and utilization), a variety of thick and thin bifaces, scrapers, and unifaces (Figure
16, g-l, Table 6). These formal tools, as well as the projectile points, were
distributed throughout all levels of the excavation, indicating that the site’s
inhabitants were involved in diverse but similar activities--hunting, gathering, and
processing--throughout the history of the site.
Lithic debitage is the most common artifact recovered in all levels of the
excavation, indicating that lithic reduction was one of the primary activities in the

area tested. Most of the inventory consists of tertiary and secondary flakes and
decorticate chips, but cores and thick bifaces are also present. Samples recovered
by fine screening from several levels in various test units yielded only minimal
quantifies of small bifacial thinning flakes, indicating that much of the final
knapping apparently was being done in other areas of the site.
The Spring Midden typifies the patterning of large open campsites along the
Devils River in optimal resource zones. The stately oaks that surround the campground are but a vestige of the dense groves of hardwood trees described by early
settlers. The site overlooks the largest and most reliable spring in the area and would
be expected to have been occupied throughout prehistory. The wide range of
activities illustrated by the artifact inventory is compatible with a reliable resource
base that probably would have encouraged long-duration habitation. These test
excavations have served to demonstrate the archeological significance of the Spring
Midden, both in terms of its information potential and its special role in the overall
settlement patterns of this region.
Fawcett’s Cave, 41VV999
Fawcett’s Cave is a well-known geologic feature, explored, mapped and
studied by the Texas Speleological Society (TSS) (TSS files) and described for the
Devils River Natural Area survey by Deal and Fieseler (1975). The cave extends
under the divide between Horseshoe Bend Canyon and Jane Hollow, north of the
Horseshoe Bend of the Dry Devils River in the heart of the densely utilized upland
flat near excavated sites 41VV964 and 41VV889. Important geologic features are
found in six mapped galleries more than 2,450 feet (750 meters) long and dropping
to as much as 110 feet (33 meters) below the surface. Although the entrance, a round
opening in the limestone bedrock, is less than a meter in diameter, the massive talus
cone in the cave beneath it is at least 10 meters high and 10 meters wide. The cave
is also a bat sanctuary, so the downslope side of the talus is slick with guano.
Fawcett’s Cave mirrors on a much grander scale the configuration of Seminole
Sink, a vertical shaft cemetery in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park, where
Early Archaic and Late Prehistoricskeletal material was excavated in 1984 (Turpin
1988). Before TPWD acquired the cave, and, in conjunction with a TSS bat census
field trip, David G. Robinson excavated a 1 -by- 1-meter test unit on the slope of the
talus cone beneath the entrance hole. Among the faunal remains recovered was a
fragment of a long bone shaft that resembled a human tibia. Further testing of this
enormous talus cone was carded out under the supervision of Leland C. Bement
during the field school to ascertain whether the site was archeologically as well as
biologically and speleologically significant. The following summary of site testing
is based on Bement’s field report.
The testing presented several logistical problems that were resolved by the use
of equipment of proven utility at other sinkhole burial sites. A heavy steel bar placed
across the entrance held a pulley for hoisting matrix from the depths of the cave, and
a cable ladder suspended from a frame below the entrance led to an extension ladder

44

Texas Archeological Society

set against the massive breakdown blocks. A portable generator on the surface
provided electricity for lighting. All materials that accumulated near the opening
each day had to be removed at the close of work lest they impede the evening bat
flights.
Two 1-by-l-meter units were excavated in 10 cm levels (Figure 17), and
the matrix was bagged and removed to the work station at the Windmill Midden
site (41VV964) where it was water-screened through window screen-sized mesh.
Unit A was in the drop zone directly below the entrance in a narrow, rock-strewn
crawl space affectionately called the Antechamber. Recovery was limited to faunal remains, including bones of porcupine, rattlesnake, deer, and hundreds of
bats of the species Myotis velifer, the common cave bat that still inhabits the
sinkhole. This unit was terminated at 40 cm.

Unit B was near the base of the talus cone beneath a zone of large breakdown blocks (Figure 17). A discrepancy between compass readings and magnetic north as shown on the 1961 TSS map could not be reconciled, but the field
school map (Figure 17) shows the locations of both units in relation to the outstanding speleological feature in this part of the cave--a white flowstone drape
15 feet (4.6 meters) tall known as The Ghost of Fawcett’s Cave. The remains of
at least two large deer were removed from the surface of and around Unit B.
Included in a quantity of animal bone removed as Level 1 was one human finger bone, recovered during water screening. A second human bone, a metatarsal
identified in Level 2, confirmed the archeological nature of the cave deposit.
The crew broke through the flowstone at the bottom of Level 2 and obtained
from Level 3 a sample of Pleistocene-age fauna, including camelid, turtle, deer,
and the ubiquitous bat. The unit was abandoned on contact with an impenetrable
flowstone sheet at the base of Level 3, beyond the range of possible human use
of the cave. The only artifact recovered during this investigation was a complete Frio dart point found on the surface of the talus cone (Figure 14, 1).
This testing program demonstrated that Fawcett’s Cave is an archeological site
with the potential to yield significant information about regional mortuary practices
and human health, diet, and physical characteristics. The camelid remains recovered from Level 3 of Unit B also suggest that the cave may be of paleontological
importance. The talus cone is a fragile environment for these osteological remains
unless traffic from the nearby entrance is controlled. These test excavations should
help TPWD plan for future exploration and protection of both the cultural and
natural resources of Fawcett’s Cave.
41VVl145, Horizontal Shaft Cave, Rough Spring Canyon
Limited testing of 41VV 1145, recorded during the field school, was conducted
by a group of TAS volunteers during the 1989 Thanksgiving weekend. The site is
a horizontal shaft cave in the bottom of Rough Spring Canyon, 4.3 km above its
confluence with the Devils River. Formed by ground water action, this solution
cavity was exposed in the vertical canyon wall by stream downcutting (Figure 18).
The cave was first documented as a rock art site because many apparently
random straight lines have been incised into the bedrock on the gently sloping floor,
sides, and roof inside the opening (Figures 18, 19). Its small size and the likelihood
of frequent flooding precluded extensive habitation, but it seems highly probable
that it was used as a ritual or sacred location. Testing was undertaken to determine
whether the cave held human burials and to identify the activities that may have
produced the cut-marks and lithic debris in the antechamber.
The cave entrance is 2.2 meters high and 2.7 meters across at the mouth, and
the floor is about a meter above the creek bed. The antechamber extends about 3
meters into the bedrock before the upward slope of the floor begins to constrict it.
At 5 meters, the shaft is reduced to a low, horizontal tunnel, ranging from 30 to 50
cm in height and 60 to 90 cm in width, for 27 meters, where the crawl space is
blocked by sediments that have filled the tunnel.

46

Texas Archeological Society

Figure 18. Photograph showing cut marks around the entrance to the horizontal shaft cave,
41VVl145.

The loose f’fll that covered the floor just inside the mouth of the cave was
removed to determine whether additional cut-marks may have been buried when
material slumped from the mound of dirt that extends from the middle of the
antechamber to the mouth of the small tunnel. Not only were more grooves exposed,
but ~reening also produced a considerable number of chipped stone artifacts.
Two contiguous test pits were excavated in the front part of the cave. Test
Pit 1, a 1-meter square, was laid out in the center of the mounded deposit, with
one edge paralleling the profile that had been exposed by cleaning out the loose
fill. Test Pit 2 extended the grid-east wall of Test Pit 1 to the curving wall of the
cave, a distance of roughly 75 to 90 cm. Both were dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels, and all matrix was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth.
Excavation revealed that 30 to 40 cm of prehistoric cultural material is buried
in a dark gray sediment deposited in the front of the cave by backwash flooding.
The depth of deposits increases toward the rear of the antechamber, reaching
perhaps 80 cm near the mouth of the tunnel. Temporally diagnostic projectile
points, typed as Ensor, Frio-like, and Val Verde (Figure 14, i-k), were recovered from these test pits (Table 7), indicating that the site was used from the
Middle to Late Archaic. Lithic chipping debris was the largest artifact category,
but a few chipped stone tools, a mano fragment, and bone, charcoal, and burned
rock were recovered.
A third test unit, 50 cm square, was excavated in the tunnel at an arbitrary
point 2.5 meters from its entry, where the unit was readily accessible and matrix

could be moved from it out to the screens. The top of the first 20-cm level, Level
1, contained quantities of recent decaying organic materials--bone and teeth-all byproducts of sheep, goats, and small animals that used the cave, and a small
amount of lithic debris and charcoal. Level 2 yielded bone, charcoal, and lithic
debris. From the bottom of Level 2 to bedrock at 78 cm, only one bone fragment and one lump of charcoal were recovered.
This very limited testing program produced no evidence of human burials
in the shaft cave, but so little of the tunnel area was sampled that these findings
are not conclusive. The lithic debris found in the upper level of the one test pit
in the tunnel may have been redeposited by flood waters from the larger entrance chamber. The more substantial cultural deposits in the antechamber demonstrate that the cave was used for maintenance activities, but the low rate of
deposition makes separation of temporal components difficult. The intensity of
occupation apparently was not sufficient to have produced the dense concentration of incised lines, from either tool manufacturing or hide processing, suggesting that a nonutilitarian explanation is more appropriate.

ROCK ART RECORDING

Another task undertaken by TAS in 1989 was the accurate recording of both
previously recorded and recently discovered rock art sites in the DRSNA. The
call for preservation of the famous rock paintings of the Lower Pecos region has
echoed through the literature for more than 50 years (Jackson 1938), but the
myriad sources of deterioration, from both natural decay and human intervention, have impeded any major conservation programs (Silver 1985; Turpin 1982).
Detailed recording is emerging as the most important task in rock art research
(Smits 1990) because of the lack of technical means of preserving the paintings
and the prohibitive cost of protecting them from further deterioration. Long-time
photographic recorder of Lower Pecos rock art, Jim Zintgraff, donated his services to the project, photographing the most well-preserved pictographs in the
DRSNA and vicinity. In his 30 years of experience, Zintgraff has developed a
special system for photographing rock art, using polarized flashes and filters,
and a large-format camera to produce excellent color reproductions.
Since the dolomitic limestones of the Devils River area, especially those
along Dolan Creek, tend to fracture and powder, they provide a poor surface for
the preservation of paintings. Weathering has dimmed the once vibrant colors,
and mineral accretions have both obscured many elements and accelerated exfoliation. The DRSNA pictographs vary in their clarity, so reconstruction is
necessary if the entire range of the iconography is to be documented. An alternative to photography--the one used in the Lower Pecos by the most famous
rock art recorder in Texas, Forrest Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967)-is water-color scale copies. They are sometimes criticized as being prone to
artistic bias, but drawings allow for some reconstruction of the artist’s intent,
especially if the copyist is intimately familiar with the topics, conventions, and
techniques of the various styles. In the DRSNA, all the pictographs belong to
the Pecos River style (the most ancient art [Figures 2, 3]), the Red Linear style
(a Late Archaic miniature art form), or the Historic period (differentiated by the
introduction of motifs from European or Plains cultures [Figure 4]).
The TAS responded to the urgent need for renderings of the DRSNA rock
art by fielding a special team of artists and photographers (Figure 9). Led by
Teddy Stickney, this crew recorded pictographs at rockshelters 41VV207,
41VV209, 41VV888, 41VV889, 41VV921, and 41VV1088 during the field
school ~obinson 1989). Later, on weekends and holidays, these volunteers
continued the documentation by copying remnant figures in 41VV527 and
41VV915.
The procedures used and refined by the rock art crew were drawn up by
artist Nola Montgomery, of TPWD; they were tested during the field school for
broader application to other endangered pictograph sites on state-owned lands.
David G. Robinson, of TARL, who has been producing illustrations of rock art
for the past ten years, contributed his experience in the reconstruction of badly
deteriorated images.

50

Texas Archeological Society

The first step in the recording process is to lay a 1-meter baseline along the
bottom curvature of the rear wall of the shelter to permit the accurate recording of
the provenience and relationships of the individual figures. The designs are
sketched and described on a preliminary map on graph paper referred to the
measured base line. Overlapping black-and-white and 35 mm color photographs are
then taken to cover each section of the panel (each photograph includes color and
tone correction charts and a scale). Slow color film, such as color positive or slide
film, requires the use of a tripod, but is preferred because of its fine texture.
Each scene is then copied in pencil onto graph paper, using the most convenient
scale. A transparent plastic grid is sometimes superimposed on the larger paintings
to provide a guide for proportions and relationships. Water color copies are made,
using a color palette matched to the earth tones of the mineral pigments used in the
pictographs.
TPWD plans to use the techniques and method~ developed at the field school
in documenting the rock art in other parks, most notably sites that were not copied
during a survey of Seminole Canyon State Historic Park and the newly recorded
pictographs at Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area. The one cautionary note
introduced by a review of the copies produced during the field school is the oftrepeated criticism of artistic bias. It is imperative that reconstruction of faded or
deteriorated rock art be done by artists who are well versed in the regional styles.
There is no room for artistic license in this type of documentation, but restricting the
copiers to reproducing only the paint that remains on the walls today results in
images that bear little resemblance to the original drawings or the intent of the
prehistoric artist.
DISCUSSION OF FIELD SCHOOL FINDINGS

The major accomplishments of the 1989 field school contributed to three of the
TAS’s primary goals: conservation of resources, education, and research. In
conservation of resources, the identification or reassessment of 239 archeological
sites on the newly acquired State property provided the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department with a management tool, saving them hundreds of thousands of dollars
and considerable time and effort. More specific testing programs at six sites gave
the TPWD information about previously unknown paleontological deposits, possible mortuary sites, and ritual behavior, and advised them of the importance of both
rockshelters and open camp sites.
From an educational perspective, the emphasis on broad area survey exposed
many of the participants to recording methods that had not been addressed in most
of the previous TAS field schools. This field school also launched the rock art
recording crew, an endeavor that has taken on a life of its own as a formal organized
activity of the TAS that now extends far beyond the boundaries of the DRSNA
(Robinson 1989).
Finally, the comparative data gathered by this large area survey permit
refinement of regional settlement patterns on the Devils River that previously had

Turpin and Davis ~ 1989 TAS Field School

51

been based largely on information gathered on the Rio Grande and the Pecos River.
One major difference from the Rio Grande and the Pecos, seen in the DRSNA and
corroborated by subsequent surveys, is the dearth of large, deep rockshelters along
the Devils River. The few exceptions, such as Baker Cave, Big Satan Canyon, and
Skyline Shelter, were obviously intensively utilized throughout prehistory. Most of
the rockshelters in this area are small or structurally weak shallow overhangs that
provided only limited protection, so there was less intensive occupation, shallower
deposits, more disturbance of the strata, and poorer preservation. The equivalent of
Pecos River rockshelters, in terms of intensity of occupation, may be the enormous
open camps that line both banks of the Devils River and are concentrated at the
mouths of the major tributaries where several different resource zones meet.
The tendency of the limestone bedrock to exfoliate has drastically affected the
preservation of rock art along the Devils River, but enough remains to detect
regional differences within the various styles. Sites in the DRSNA have at least two
examples (41VV207 and 41VV209) of the Devils River variation on the typical
Pecos River style feline theme. At 41VV207 and at other sites down river, the cigarshaped mountain lions are painted high on the shelter walls above other figures. The
Devils River artists were also more likely to conventionalize human figures into
miniature parabolic bodies with upraised stubby arms, usually lining up several in
a row (Figure 20).
The recording of many middens on the upland fiats is another contribution of
the field school to clarification of Lower Pecos settlement patterns. Along the Rio
Grande, the Pecos River, and on the extreme lower reaches of the Devils River,
remnant outcrops of Buda Limestone form rounded hills surrounded by fiat surfaces
of Del Rio Clay. The prehistoric people preferred open campsites on these fiat
surfaces as long as they were near the heads of rapidly entrenching tributaries.
Inevitably, therounded hills of BudaLimestone are fringedby burned rock middens
and hearth fields composed of t~tpavements of burned rock and dense lithic debris.
However, in the DRSNA, and in general along the Devils River above Big Satan
Canyon, the Buda Limestone has completely eroded away, so this setting is not
represented in the inventory of sites. But, in all three river systems, burned rock
middens and scatters line the gentler reaches of the tributaries, especially at
confluences with other minor drainageways. The more rapid entrenchment of
canyons along the Pecos and Rio Grande is reflected in the lower frequency of sites
in the lower stretches where the walls limit the living space. Upland middens in the
Pecos and Rio Grande survey areas are concentrated along the rims of the major
river valleys and around the heads of plunging tributaries, where steep dropoffs
often create tinajas that hold rain water. In the DRSNA, middens and open campsites
are most frequently seen on the upland fiats near springs, the heads of minor
drainageways or natural depressions that served as rainwater reservoirs. Many of
these upland tinajas are now filled with sediment that masks the role they played in
settlement strategies.
A less obvious, but nevertheless important, environmental response to differences in topography is illustrated by the relationship of site types to landforms along

the three rivers. The Pecos canyon is relatively narrow and deeply entrenched, with
sheer cliffs broken only by tributary streams that have formed their own equally
steep-sided canyons. Although the Rio Grande has a much broader floodplain with
terraces suitable for open campsites along much of its course, access from the
riverine floodplain to upland resources is restricted to the avenues provided by the
tributaries. The many hanging tributaries, formed where their downcutting has not
kept pace with the entrenchment of the river, have formed cliffs that block transit
between the two drainageways, limiting settlement on these floodplains.
Although massive bluffs loom over the lower Devils River, the cliffs alternate with gentler, sloping valley wails, creating an undulating terrain. Typically,
the slopes are stepped, rising in three tiers from the river bed to the bluff top.
The distance between the streams and the upland flats is greater where the slopes
are stepped than where the cliffs are steep, but travel on the uplands was not
restricted to the drainages or the occasional breaks in the cliff line. These differences in elevation influenced site selection, with the result that open campsites
fringe the canyon rims along the Pecos and Rio Grande, where there was better
access to resources. Reliance by inhabitants of the Devils River area mainly on
open campsites that are scattered across the broad upland flats may have been
due in partto the scarcity of habitable shelters along the streams and in part to
the abundance of springs. In addition, these upland locations were free from the
constraints imposed by limited accessibility.
The differences in distribution of site types between the Pecos and Devils
rivers are of importance in studies of settlement patterns where the causal, or
deterministic, effect of environment as Opposed to the effect of culture has long
been argued. In the Lower Pecos, it is possible to see the effects of both environment and culture as settlement preferences changed over time and space. The
environmental constraints discussed above are obvious, since they operated directly upon the basic human needs for water, food, and shelter, but several equally
effective options were part of this broad adaptation to the topography, hydrology, and biota of the region.
The effect of cultural selection on site distributional patterns in the Lower
Pecos region is best illustrated by several changes that first become evident in the
Late Prehistoric period, when rock art, which presumably is not overly influenced
by environmental factors, was painted in a different style and in different places.
Similarly, after a long tradition of interment of the dead in rockshelters, caves,
and sinkholes, cairn burial emerged in the Late Prehistoric period as another
choice of mortuary practice. Despite the availability of rockshelter homes, intrusive people apparently preferred open camps on high promontories, where they
erected the circular rock structures that identify the Infierno phase. Still later, in
the historic Native American period, acquisition of the horse produced yet another shift in site selection, favoring campsites that were more accessible to water
holes and grazing land.
In summary, the 1989 TAS Field School produced data that made possible
the first comparisons of settlement patterns in subregions within the relatively

54

well defined Lower Pecos cultural area. The survey identified several environmental factors that affected prehistoric use of the landscape. Most obvious are
the distribution of permanent and casual water sources, the availability of
rockshelter habitation, and accessibility among diverse resource zones. The
human element is most apparent in the various options exercised by the people
whose cultural preferences are expressed by where they lived, how they buried
their dead, and what they considered worthy of commemoration in their art.
