Abstract

AbstrAct
In February of 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources
investigation in support of the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) proposed Nolke
Substation in Crockett County, Texas. The proposed substation will encompass an area of
approximately 17-acres. The proposed project area was assessed through a 100 percent
pedestrian archeological survey supplemented with judgementally placed shovel tests.
AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8347.
The pedestrian survey targeted areas within the proposed 17-acre Nolke project area such as
topographical features that are more conducive to containing intact cultural deposits. Ten shovel
tests were excavated within the proposed substation footprint. During the survey, AmaTerra
documented six Isolated Occurrences (IOs). No archeological sites were documented during
the survey. Based on the lack of archeological sites, in addition to the upland erosional nature of
the project area, it is the opinion of AmaTerra that there is little to no potential for the proposed
17-acre substation project area to contain previously unidentified archeological historic
properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12). As such, AmaTerra recommends
that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional
investigations, as there is little to no potential for construction to affect archeological historic
properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4 (d) (1) or SALs.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. Project field documentation, photos, etc. and
final report will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of
Texas-Austin as required under terms and conditions of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8335.

Introduction
In February 2018, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), at the request
of the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), conducted a cultural resources survey of the
LCRA’s proposed 17-acre Noelke Substation approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of
Iraan in Crockett County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed substation will encompass
an area of approximately 17 acres. In its Fiscal Year 2018 Capital Plan, LCRA identified
improvements to increase service reliability to transmission customers at various locations.
One of these service reliability improvements is the Noelke Substation Project. The proposed
project will increase transmission service reliability by converting an existing 138-kV “tapped”
(or switch-connected substation) to a three-breaker ring bus equipped with relaying, controls
and real time monitoring.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned or controlled by a political
subdivision of the State of Texas (LCRA), the proposed project is subject to the provisions of
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The ACT, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code, defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this state,
including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas Constitution,
Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must identify
potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.
Field investigations were conducted March 3 and 4, 2018. W. Nicholas Trierweiler served as
the project’s Principal Investigator and James J. Hill acted as the project archaeologist, while
Steven Schooler assisted with field investigations. Archeologists encountered no difficulties in
completing the investigations.
The survey resulted in the documentation of six Isolated Occurrences (IOs). Field investigations
were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA
n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources
discovered within the study area, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP or for
formal SAL designation and, should archeological historic properties or sites be located, make
recommendations for future management options such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations.

Environmental Setting
The proposed project is located within the Edwards Plateau physiographic region (Figure 3).
This environment is an uplifted and elevated region originally formed from marine deposits
of sandstone, limestone, dolomites, and shales approximately 100 million years ago during
the Cretaceous Period when this region was predominantly covered by an ocean. The western
portion demonstrates a relatively flat elevated plateau. The eastern portion, known as the Texas
Hill Country, is largely eroded.
This region originally supported a rich diversity of forbs and grasses before human settlement.
Cedar was restricted to overgrazed areas along rivers and streams, and in areas of shallow soils
and steep canyons where wildfire ecology did not occur frequently. White-tailed deer were
rarely found in the grasslands. European settlement introduced fences, cows, sheep, goats and
the control of fire. Livestock were continuously grazed in fenced pastures which disrupted the
natural movement patterns of grazing animals. Plants were not allowed to rest and recover from
grazing. By 1900, continuous overgrazing and control of fire had taken its toll. The land began
to change from a grassland to a brushland. Many of the woody brush species were readily
grazed by sheep, goats, cattle, and an increasing deer herd. In much of the Edwards Plateau,
cedar has become the dominant plant species causing a once diverse and healthy landscape to
exhibit more limited plant diversity.
The Edwards Plateau region is characterized largely by a dissected limestone plateau with
undulating hills to the south and east where it is easily distinguished from bordering ecological
regions by a sharp fault line (Griffith et al. 2007). This environment is an uplifted and elevated
region originally formed from marine deposits of sandstone, limestone, dolomites, and shales
approximately 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period when this region was
predominantly covered by an ocean. The western portion demonstrates a relatively flat elevated
plateau. The eastern portion, known as the Texas Hill Country, is largely eroded.
The West Texas region can be quite diverse and contains several north to south oriented
mountain ranges separated by internal drainage basins. It is characterized by a semiarid climate
with a dominance of stunted xerophytic vegetation. It is commonly considered a northern
extension of the Chihuahuan Desert Province (Blair 1950:105). The western extent of Crockett
County is characterized by terrain consisting of high tabletop mesas and wide-open prairies.
Tributaries associated with the nearby Pecos River have created numerous canyon washes
and erosional drainages surrounding the proposed Noelke project area. This vast landscape
comprises an ecological transition zone at the junction of the high and rolling plains in the
north, the Edwards Plateau in the east, the scrub-brush country in the south, and the Chihuahuan
Desert’s mountain basins in the west.

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the area is a continuation of the Cretaceous-age Edwards limestone that forms
the core of the karst terrain associated with the Edwards Plateau (Griffith et al. 2007:16). Soils
overlying limestone bedrock.
According to the U.S, Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS), soils consist primarily of Reagan silty clay (Figure 4). These soils are very
shallow, shallow, and very deep, nearly level to gently sloping, loamy soils on uplands. (USDA
NRCS 2016). Regionally, most soil are aeolian and colluvial silty clay and sandy clay loams
(USDA-NRCS 2018).

Vegetation, Hydrology, and Climate
Arid Chihuahuan Desert vegetation supported by this environment can include conifer and
hardwood forest flora (Figure 5). Vegetation observed during this survey included cedar, juniper,
Spanish dagger aloerita, catclaw, persimmon, sotol, yucca, prickly pear cactus, tasajillo, and
numerous desert shrubs. Most precipitation in this area occurs in the summer months during
brief thunderstorms. The average annual rainfall is thirteen inches. Temperatures range from
an average low of 31 °F in January to an average high of 96 °F in July.

And prevIous InvestIgAtIon
The project area is situated near the intersection of four archeological regions as defined by
Perttula (2004). It resides almost at the border of the Trans-Pecos, Lower Pecos, Southern High
Plains, and Central Texas regions (Perttula 2004), though the Trans-Pecos is archeologically
more closely related to the West Texas archaeological regions (Figure 6). It is characterized by its
numerous natural rock shelters formed in limestone canyons and cliffs, as well as its ubiquitous
raw lithic outcrops and isolated micro-environments near artesian springs. Offering protection
from the elements, rockshelter localities were consistently attractive to hunter-gatherers, and
from an archeological standpoint, they create ideal conditions for the preservation of burned
rock middens, organic materials, burials, and petroglyphic and pictographic rock art.
Typically, cultural chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Pre-Clovis
and Paleoindian (16,000–8800 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300
BP), Late Prehistoric (1200/1300–250 BP), and Historic (250 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981).
While the Prehistoric Periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile
points and other technologies, they are intended to order cultural change and are thus
somewhat arbitrary; cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast
area of Texas. A regional chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods are detailed in the following sections. Once a culture chronology for this
region of Texas has been summarized, a brief overview of archeological work in proximity
to the project area will be provided.

pre-clovIs And pAleoIndIAn (cA. 16,000–8800 bp)
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago
(Jennings and Waters 2014). Some evidence suggests the presence of Pre-Clovis occupations
in Texas at the Debra L. Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk Creek in Bell County (Waters et
al. 2011). Artifacts found at this site include bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified flake tools,
blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and macrodebitage. Additionally, PreClovis components have been reported from the Gault Site, situated upstream from the Debra
L. Friedkin Site.
The Paleoindian Period dates from approximately 11,500–8800 BP and is often
subdivided into the Early and Late Paleoindian subperiods (Collins 2004).
The
Paleoindian period was characterized by cooler and wetter climatic conditions than today.
Paleoindian peoples practiced unique subsistence patterns that consisted of hunting now
extinct megafauna and foraging from local plant resources (Black 1989; Mauldin et al.
2003). As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis,
Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the archeological record.

These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears. Using the
launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such as mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna,
Paleoindian groups likely harvested less daunting prey including antelope, turtle, frogs, etc.
Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during this later portion of the period,
eventually shifting to Dalton, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. Environmental studies
suggest that Late Pleistocene Epoch climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels
2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during most of the Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift to drier
and warmer conditions at the onset of the Early Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998). The end of
the Pleistocene was likely arid to semiarid, and prickly pear and agave populations were high
(Bousman et al. 1990:94, 98). As megafauna gradually died off during the shift to a warmer
climate, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant foraging. Intact Paleoindian
occupations in the Trans-Pecos region are somewhat rare and consist mostly of kill sites found
near rockshelters (Turpin 1995), or isolated projectile points within multicomponent scatters
(Seebach 2001). This cultural change is visible in the archaeological record and marks the
onset of the Archaic Period.

Archaic Period (ca. 8800–1200/1300 BP)
The Archaic Period, which lasted approximately 7500 years, is divided into the Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic subperiods (Collins 2004). The Archaic Period exhibited a shift from more
mobile hunting strategies to a heavier reliance on a broader spectrum of local plants and
animals (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004) and broadly dates to 7000–800 BP. Rockshelters were
more intensively utilized during the Archaic, thus leading to an increase in rock art. This period
signifies a shift away from megafauna to smaller animals, a more intensive reliance on plant
resources, an increased use in ground stones for food processing, a decrease in residential
mobility, the systematic burial of the dead, the use of stone cooking technology, and an increase
in woodworking tools (Yelacic and Lohse 2011). The Late Archaic in the Trans-Pecos is the
best understood sequence and suggests that a population increase took place with a heavier
reliance on specialized food processing earth ovens (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Common
site types of this period include large-scale burned rock middens and are exposed on mesa tops
overlooking canyons and water sources.
Mallouf (1985: Figure 14) has summarized chronologies unique to the Trans-Pecos, and it
was refined further into ten prehistoric periods and a phase by Turpin (1995). Some overlap
in projectile point technologies is shared between the Trans Pecos and Central Texas. Hester
places the Early Archaic in neighboring Central Texas between 7950 and 4450 BP based on
Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched projectile points (1995:436–438). Collins’
dating of the Early Archaic period to 8800–6000 BP is founded on unstemmed point types
(1995:383). Middle Archaic materials date from about 6000 to 4000 BP (Collins 1995:383).
The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between 4000 and 800 BP (Collins 1995:384).

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1200/1300–250 BP)
The commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 800 BP with a hallmark transition
to the bow and arrow (Hester 1981). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest
prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required for atlatl
maneuverability. The use of arrows is indicated by smaller-sized, triangular projectile points.
Another turning point in the Late Prehistoric period is the first substantial presence of pottery.
Trans-Pecos sites dating to the Late Prehistoric suggest a continued reliance on rockshelters,
but also show up in the form of tipi rings, cairn burials, and pit houses built along water source
terraces. Perdiz arrow points, groundstone implements, beveled bifacial knives, end-notched
sinker stones, and ornamental beads add more diversity to the archeological record during this
interval.

Historic Period (250 BP–Present)
Beginning in the late AD 1500s, Europeans entered what is now Texas only sporadically. The
first exposure to European contact comes with the arrival of Alva Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca
and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition in 1528. In Crockett County, the first
Spaniards to pass through the area were part of the Gaspar Castaño de Sosa mining expedition
in 1590 (Smith 2016). Between 1528 and the late 1600s, Spanish excursions into the Texas
territory were limited, but Spanish records described a number of Native American tribes like
the Coahuiltecans. They were described as family units of hunter gatherers that resided near
streams and springs, whose camps were revisited on a seasonal basis (Campbell 1983:349–351).
By the mid-1700s, the Comanche had begun entering the region from the north, following the
buffalo migrations. Efficiency on horseback allowed them to displace numerous native groups
and control trade and prime hunting grounds. In 1821, Spain lost control of most of its North
American territories when it recognized the independence of Mexico. Anglo settlement in
Texas soon followed in the 1830s when Stephen F. Austin’s colonists were allotted impresario
contracts by the newly formed Mexican government. After the fight for Texas Independence,
independent Republic of Texas prospered for ten years, eventually joining the United States in
1845. The threat of Indian hostility was still present, especially in the vicinity of the Pecos River.
To safeguard travelers from Indian attack and to protect the San Antonio-El Paso Mail route,
the United States Army established Fort Lancaster in 1855 (Smith 2016). Named after David
Crockett, one of the heroes of the infamous Alamo, the county was established on January 12,
1875, but was not formally organized until July 7, 1891 when an election established Ozona
as the county seat. As for much of West Texas, ranching dominated the local economy for
decades. Although having not experienced the oil boom as other nearby counties due largely
in part because of a lack of a railway through Crockett County, petroleum and natural gas
production nonetheless created a major uptick in the local economy leading up to and after
the Great Depression. Today, Crockett County is still largely rural, but ranching coupled with
petroleum and natural gas development has supported a stable economy.

Previous Cultural Resource Investigations
An archeological background review was conducted in February 2018. The Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and recorded cultural resources.
This review focused on the identification of previously recorded archaeological sites, Registered
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62
mile) of the project area (Figure 7).
According to the Atlas, there are no previously recorded sites within the project area or within
one-kilometer of the project area. Additionally, no archeological surveys have been conducted
with one-km of the project area. The nearest known site is 41CX111, recorded in 1974 and in
1976 about 3-km north-northwest of the project area, and 41CX1019, recorded in 2008 about
3-km east-northeast of the project area. These sites were described respectively as a campsite
on a mesa top with scattered lithics and ceramics, and as a mortar hole and burned rock midden
with lithic scatter on a mesa and with a rock shelter with pictographs three mortar holes and a
spring seep below the mesa escarpment. Site 41CX1019 was assessed as having potential for
consideration as a State Antiquities Landmark.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps show that historically the area has been
rural, with no indication of residential or commercial development (Figure 8). Much of the
general area is characterized by existing and derelict oil and gas wells and accompanying
infrastructure. Examination of more recent USGS topographic maps indicate the area is still
largely undeveloped except for features associated with the gas and oil industry as indicated on
the 1970 USGS 7.5 quadrangle map Texas.

Methods
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for historic-period archaeological materials. This research involved examining historical maps
and aerial photographs. In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2018) to assess the
potential for previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area, as well as a
review of literature on archaeological sites within the region. This allowed investigators to
identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or within the project area, and
provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages, and average depth of cultural
materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the proposed project area limits were overlaid on
aerial based gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in navigation.
Field investigation of the proposed Noelke Substation project area was conducted according to
standard survey methods and under appropriate guidelines. Review of USGS topographic maps
in combination with field investigations revealed that the majority of the proposed project area
crosses denuded upland terrain containing shallow soils. The survey was conducted March
2018 and conformed to survey standards set forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists
(CTA). Field investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey supplemented by ten
judgementally placed shovel tests. Survey transects were conducted at 20 m intervals across
the entire project area. Shovel tests typically measured 30 cm in diameter and ranged between
40 and 80 cm in depth. The shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments and all removed
soil was screened through ¼ inch hardware mesh to ensure artifact recovery. Appropriate
shovel test data was recorded on an AmaTerra shovel test form, and all shovel test locations
were plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
During pedestrian survey, the ground surface was visually inspected for cultural materials
which were identified as FCR, debitage, bifacial lithic tools in varying stages of lithic reduction,
projectile points, ground stone implements, or historic materials over 50 years in age. Based
on density and diversity of artifacts, as well as the lack of lateral extension of these materials,
they were recorded as an IO and not as an archeological site.
For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural
materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The criteria for recorded an
archeological site employed during the survey was: 1) five or more surface artifacts within a
15-m radius, or 2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or rock art, observed on the surface.
No portion of the proposed project area meet these criteria; hence no archeological sites were
recorded. Specific information on all IOs was recorded in the field through field notes, digital
photographs, and GPS points.

When an artifact was encountered during the survey, extra scrutiny was given to the area
surrounding it. If the item(s) was/were isolated or did not meet the project criteria to qualify as a
site, it was noted as an Isolated Occurrence (IO). If the area included features or a concentration
of artifacts, it was recorded as a cultural resource site. These artifacts were random discoveries
encountered outside of the context of an archaeological site as defined for this project. The
majority of these were specimens of FCR and chert debitage. These IOs lack significance and
do not need to be avoided. The site definition criteria utilized for the purposes of the survey
were as follows:

Results
Survey was conducted throughout the LCRAs proposed 17-acre Noelke Substation project
area. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated and six IOs were identified during the survey
(Figure 9). Shovel tests measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and
extended no deeper than 50 cm below surface (cmbs). Shovel testing was undertaken only at
the proposed substation location due to its position along the apex of a mesa and its potential
to contain subsurface deposits. Shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all soil
was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. No cultural material was encountered in any
subsurface test. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form
and will be curated at TARL along with all other documentation associated with the project
after the final report is submitted to LCRA.
Field efforts identified six IOs. For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site was
defined as containing a specified number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years
within a given area. The definition of a site used in this study was: 1) five or more surface
artifacts within a 15-m radius, or 2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or rock art,
observed on the surface. All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to their original
locations as per LCRA requirement that no artifacts were to be collected during the survey.

Isolated Occurrences (IO’s)
During field investigations, six IOs were identified within the proposed project area. All six
IOs were prehistoric in nature and are summarized in the following table (Table 1).

encounter any conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted the cultural
resource survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8347 and work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archaeologists excavated 10 shovel tests, all of which were located within
the footprint of the proposed 17-acre substation location. All shovel tests revealed silty clay
loams and sandy loams overlying shallow subsoil and dense carbonate enriched sediments. No
cultural material was encountered in any shovel test. Survey crews documented six IOs, but
did not identify any previously unrecorded archeological sites.
Based on these results, AmaTerra recommends that no additional archaeological investigations
are necessary and the proposed construction for the LCRAs 17-acre Noelke Substation should
be allowed to proceed as planned. It is the opinion of AmaTerra that it is unlikely that any
unidentified archaeological sites or other historic properties eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or formal SAL listing are located in the study area. None of the six IOs identified
meet the criteria as an archeological site, hence they do not need to be avoided. In the event
that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the
immediate area should cease, and the Texas Historical Commission should be contacted to
initiate accidental discovery procedures.
If it is determined that the proposed project requires additional acreage or new access roads
not included in the current study, then additional cultural resources investigations may
be necessary in those areas. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are
discovered during construction, work in the immediate area of discovery would cease and the
THC will be contacted.
