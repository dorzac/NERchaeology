Panda Energy Sherman Power Plant Utilities

Abstract
Panda Energy, LLC (Panda), proposes to construct utilities to its new power plant locale in the
City of Sherman (City) Progress Park in Grayson County, Texas. A 138Kv transmission line will be
constructed to the plant site along with a 20-inch water line and a 20-inch natural gas pipeline. The Area
of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will take place is approximately 39 acres.
APC performed a reconnaissance survey under Antiquities Permit Number 6047. The survey area
covered 34.8 acres and included examination of three creek crossings and about 9000 feet of ROW
outside the plant locale. The results of the reconnaissance survey were negative. No cultural material was
observed on the ground surface and/or collected for analysis or curation. No new archeological or
historical site locations were found in the proposed utility easements.
For these reasons, APC concludes that no significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) will be
affected by the proposed activity. APC, therefore, recommends that construction proceed without
additional intensive archeological survey work or further regulatory consultation.
Lastly, APC recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during
construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified, by telephone at
(512) 398-2946. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists in consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission before digging resumes at the location.

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Panda Energy, LLC (Panda), proposes to construct utilities to its natural gas fired power plant
located in City of Sherman (City) Progress Park in Grayson County, Texas. A 138Kv transmission line
will be constructed to the plant site along with a 20-inch water line and a 20-inch natural gas pipeline. The
Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will take place is approximately 39 acres.
The project is subject to rules and regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and was
performed under Antiquities Permit Number 6047. Construction will be permitted by the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Permitting for the project is handled by TITAN
Engineering (TITAN). On behalf of Panda, TITAN contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting
(APC), to conduct a records search and a site visit for the project. Due to the fact that the land is
controlled by the City, an Antiquities Permit was required by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The reconnaissance covered 34.8 acres of the APE and findings were negative. The ROWs where
the natural gas line, transmission line, and water line will be constructed contain no cultural resources and
falls inside open fields, once under intense cultivation.
Although, no historic or archeological resources were found, modern and recent cultural material
was observed in the proposed water line ROW. The material is refuse and merits cleanup, but does not
trigger any additional cultural resources work. APC, therefore, recommends that the utility installation
project proceed without additional intensive archeological survey work or further regulatory consultation.
Lastly, APC also recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during
construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified, by telephone at
(512) 398-2946. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists, in consultation with the THC,
before digging resumes at the location.

2.0 PANDA ENERGY SHERMAN POWER PLANT UTILITIES
INTRODUCTION
The utilities installation for the Panda Energy Sherman Power Plant will be reviewed and/or
permitted by the TCEQ and is located on land owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas.
TITAN, on behalf of Panda, contracted with AP&C to comply with ACT requirements and to perform a
reconnaissance survey of the proposed utility routes. In 2009, APC performed a reconnaissance survey of
the 210-acre plant locale under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5284. The results were negative. No
historic buildings and/or new archeological sites were found.
Antiquities Permit Number 6047 was issued for the survey and was conducted in accordance with
the State of Texas Archeological Survey Standards. The purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to visit
the proposed rights-of-way (ROWs) to inspect creek crossings and to examine the floodplain for evidence
of cultural resources. The objective of the reconnaissance survey was to determine whether or not an
intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey is needed before construction commences.
PROJECT AREA
The power plant locale is situated in a once semi- rural area that is now an industrial park. Utility
ROWs span low ridge tops (Figure 2), slopes, flood plains and rises (Figure 3), ranging in elevation from
700 to 775 ft amsl. The water line runs perpendicular to a tributary, while the gas/electric lines will
parallel one. Surface visibility in the plowed fields ranged from 80 to 40 percent. Upland soils consist of
Heiden Clay, 1 to 5 per cent slopes; Fairlie and Houston Black Clay, 1 to 3 percent slope; and Normangee
Clays. Flood plain soils are Austin, Howe, Stephens, and/or Wilson Silty Clays. Shrink swell cracks are
common and deep in both upland and flood plain settings.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Panda will build a 138Kv transmission line to the plant site. In addition, a 20-inch natural gas
pipeline and a 20-inch water line will be constructed. The APE where construction will take place is
approximately 39 acres. Panda proposes to place the natural gas pipeline and an transmission line inside a
1.5 mile long, 150 feet wide, north-to-south oriented easement (ca. 27 acres). It will include two
permanent ROWs about 50 feet wide, with the remainder of the ROW being temporary easements for
construction ingress and egress. The proposed gas/electric line ROW extends north of the plant, cross
Choctaw Creek tributary in two places, and connect with existing utility lines.
Metal poles for the transmission line will be set at intervals varying from 300 to 600 feet. Depth
of pole installation will exceed 3 feet. The natural gas line will be 20-inch diameter and will be buried
about 4 feet deep. The water line will be one mile long, east-to-west oriented, 20–inch diameter, and it
will be buried at depths of 3 to 4 feet. It will connect with an existing municipal water line west of the
plant locale. The water line ROW for the purpose of this study is 100 feet wide (ca. 12 acres) and extends
west from the southwest corner of the locale for a distance of one mile. The water line will cross two
ephemeral tributaries of Choctaw Creek.

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The survey area is located in Central Texas and is a region known to contain many archeological
and historical sites. The goal of the survey is to visit the flood plain and stream crossings of Choctaw
Creek tributaries to determine the presence or absence of surficial archeological deposits in proposed
utility ROWs. The objective is to determine if an intensive pedestrian survey of any of the ROWs with
subsurface testing is warranted. The research purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to collect new
data about the cultural history and prehistory of the region and to identify any evidence of cultural
resources present in the tract proposed for development that warrant further survey investigation.
METHODS
APC performed the reconnaissance survey in accordance with the ACT rules and regulations and
followed the Texas Archeological Survey Standards. APC obtained Antiquities Permit Number 6047
from the Archeology Division of the THC. Technicians reviewed records from the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas. Site files and pertinent archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were
checked and it was determined that no historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, State Archeological Landmarks, and/or recorded sites are located inside the project area.
The reconnaissance survey covered ca. 34.8 acres of the 39-acre APE and was conducted by 2
archeologists. The scope included visits to four creek crossings. At each creek crossing, areas 150 feet
wide by 300 feet were examined (about 1.03 acres each). A total of 4.12 acres was inspected at creek
crossings. In addition, approximately 9000 feet of flood plain, 150 feet wide (ca. 30.68 acres), were
inspected via pedestrian transect and wind shield methods.
While driving along the edges of the plowed fields paralleling the creeks, arbitrary stops were
made every 500 feet to perform pedestrian inspection of the flood plain, creek banks, and any nearby
flood plain rises. No evidence of cultural resources was observed in upland. No chert rocks were
observed. No artifacts were observed during the site visit and therefore, no artifacts were collected. All
findings were summarized in this short report of negative findings following Council of Texas
Archeologists guidelines. Project records will be stored at APC. A copy of the report a will be stored at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the University of Texas At Austin.

4.0 SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
The findings of the reconnaissance survey of the proposed utility ROWs for the Panda Energy
Sherman Power Plant in Progress Park were negative. The ROW where the natural gas line and the power
line will be constructed has no cultural material and falls inside open fields, once under intense
cultivation,. The water line ROW also crosses plowed fields, still under cultivation, and contains no
evidence of archeological and /or historical sites.
The ROWs cross and parallel unnamed tributaries of Choctaw Creek. The tributaries are about
2000 feet (ca. 609 meters) to 7000 feet (2100 meters) from the main branch of Choctaw Creek and
floodplains do not contain evidence of prehistoric activity. Although, no historic or archeological
resources were found, modern and recent cultural material was observed in the proposed water line ROW
(Figure 4). The material is classes as trash and merits cleanup, but does not trigger any additional cultural
resources work.

MODERN CULTURAL MATIERAL OBSERVED
At the locale where the water line ROW crosses the main tributary of Choctaw Creek, refuse was
observed. Two early twentieth century automobile bodies were dumped in the creek bottom. These items
are considered to be trash, despite their historic age, and warrant cleanup to clear the ROW.
A recent, rectangular concrete block feature of unknown function was observed east the 150 feet
utility easement (Figure 5). The east end is solid concrete with a slight central depression and the west
end contains a small opening. The opening contains an impervious gravel layer. It is located on property
owned by the beverage maker “Sunny Delight” in a field where organic orange juice and coffee
byproducts sludge is applied. The feature sits in a low-lying area that drains the field into the tributary and
it may be related to sludge filtration/drainage/erosion and it will be avoided.
A modern horse lot was found where the water line ROW will cross Flannery Road, south of the
residential area. It is depicted on topographic maps as an open structure. The lot contains a fallen down,
modern barn/shed made of cut wood and corrugated tin (Figure 6). Adjacent to it is another collapsed,
small, corrugated tin shed. Two bath tub troughs are present, along with a pile of trash (Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
No evidence of new historic and/or archeological sites was found and only negative new cultural
resource data were collected. No cultural materials were observed in plowed fields, erosion features,
and/or upland tributary cut banks viewed. Likely, the reason for limited to no settlement by groups during
prehistoric time periods was a lack of reliable water sources and in historic times, it was due to
agricultural land uses.
The tributaries observed are seasonal and down-cutting the Late Holocene stream terrace and are
head waters of Choctaw Creek. Regional creeks are subject to flash flooding and over bank flooding and
were not selected for historic homesteads or business locations. HPAs are likely located along Choctaw
Creek to the south, outside the APE.
Uplands soils are clays and consist of Quaternary period deposits more than 10,000 years old.
Holocene-aged clay and clay loam sediments less than 10,000 years of age are present on stream terraces
in the flood plain. Recently deposited silty clay soils line the frequently flooded creek (Figure 7). Like the
Sherman Energy, LLC, power plant locale (Godwin 2009), the proposed ROWs where the Panda Energy,
LLC, Sherman Power Plant utilities will be constructed are LPAs for the presence of cultural resources
due to soil deposition and hydrology.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The Panda Energy, LLC, Sherman Power Plant utilities records search and cultural resources
reconnaissance survey were negative in results. The records search revealed that no known significant
resources eligible for NRHP or SAL listing and/or archeological and historic sites are present in the
proposed utility ROWs. Reconnaissance survey findings showed that the ROWs do not contain cultural
resources and do not merit an intensive pedestrian survey. The only cultural material observed during the
survey was refuse.
Sediments observed in the ROWs do not have the potential to contain buried prehistoric deposits.
Upland ridge tops with Quaternary period deposits in open fields contain no evidence of buried
archeological deposits. Locales in the flood plain are covered with Late Holocene and recent soils. APC,
therefore, concludes that the reconnaissance survey findings show that the utility line ROWs are Low
Probability Areas for presence of cultural resources, including buried deposits, and that no intensive
pedestrian or mechanical survey of the utility lines is needed.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that the project proceed, as planned, without additional survey work or further
regulatory consultation. Lastly, APC also recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are
exposed during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified,
by telephone at (512) 398-2946. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists in consultation with
the THC before digging resumes at the location.
