ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to Land Design Partners-DFW, Inc., conducted archeological
reconnaissance of approximately 61.6 acres, the major part of the proposed 80-acre Mansfield
Community Park in southeast Tarrant County. The parcel is bounded on the west by Matlock
Road, on the north by a residential area, and on the south and east by Walnut Creek. The city of
Mansfield plans to turn this parcel into a passive park with trails and signage that would highlight
the natural environmental zones throughout and along the creek. In the last 15 years, most of the
surrounding area has been heavily urbanized; completely surrounding the parcel with large
residential development. Geo-Marine conducted this project under Texas Antiquities Code
permit #5896 in February 2011.
This investigation was conducted as part of the Master Plan and Concept Design phase for the
park. The purpose was to determine what, if any, resources might be extant on the parcel and to
determine where additional archaeological investigations may be concentrated. Several historicage features were identified during the survey. These included a collapsed wooden structure with
associated sidewalk, a windmill, a concrete slab near it, and evidence of a second windmill/water
extraction location. It is recommended that prior to development of the park, intensive survey
occur in locations where features were identified and historic maps and aerials indicate potential
unidentified features.
Geo-Marine conducted this project under Texas Antiquities Code permit #5896 in February 2011.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In January 2011, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to Land Design Partners-DFW, Inc., conducted
archeological reconnaissance of approximately 61.6 acres, the major portion of the proposed 80Â­
acre Mansfield Community Park in southeast Tarrant County (Geo-Marine project #
30671.00.01). The parcel is bounded on the west by Matlock Road, on the north by a residential
area, and on the south and east by Walnut Creek (Figures 1 and 2). The land south and east
beyond the creek had already been acquired and partially developed by the City of Mansfield and
was not part of this investigation. The City of Mansfield plans to turn the 80-acre parcel into a
passive park with trails and signage that highlights the natural environmental zones throughout
the park and along the creek. In the last 15 years, most of the surrounding area has been heavily
urbanized, completely surrounding the parcel with large residential developments.
This investigation was conducted as part of the Master Plan and Concept Design phase for the
park. The purpose of the reconnaissance survey was to determine what, if any, resources might
be extant on the parcel and to determine where additional concentrated archaeological
investigations might be warranted. When the City of Mansfield acquired the property in 2004
from the Williams family, who had a true appreciation of the land, they introduced the land to the
staff of the Mansfield Parks and Community Services Department. Kelly Williams, Sr., and his
family had begun acquiring the property in the early 1960s and maintained and enjoyed its natural
setting along the creek throughout that period.
This investigation was conducted in partial fulfillment of the city of Mansfieldâs obligations
under federal and state laws and regulations set forth in the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852]; and the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Texas Antiquities Permit # 5896).
Melissa Green of Geo-Marine was the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist on the
project. Fieldwork was performed in mid-February 2011. In conjunction with this archeological
study, Geo-Marine Historian Marsha Prior conducted archival research and oral history
interviews with the Williams family, and Geo-Marine Historian Tanya McDougall performed
deed title research for an in-depth understanding of the familyâs role in the preservation of this
parcel.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The landscape of southern Tarrant County consists of low, rolling hills between 500 feet (ft) and
750 ft in elevation. Walnut Creek, which forms the southern boundary of the project area,
ultimately flows into the Trinity River, which in turn drains into the Gulf of Mexico at Galveston.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The parcel falls at the intersection of underlying geology consisting of Upper Cretaceous
Woodbine Formation, Eagle Ford Formation, and Quaternary Fluviatile terrace deposits (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1987). Soils in the project area fall within the Frio-Trinity association
which is composed of deep clayey soils that are nearly level and found on floodplains (Ressel
1981). The specific soils are Pulexas fine sandy loam, frequently flooded, along Walnut Creek;
and Whitesboror loam, frequently flooded, and a sliver of Arents, loamy, on the northwest border
of the property.
Pulexas fine sandy loam, frequently flooded, is a deep, nearly level soil on narrow floodplains of
streams that are within and drain sandy and loamy areas. It also occurs on slight benches or overwashes above more clayey soils on larger floodplains. Its profile is 64 inches of light yellowish
brown to yellowish brown fine sandy loam with thin loamy strata (Ressel 1981:45). Whitesboro
loam, frequently flooded, is a deep nearly level loamy soil on floodplains of major streams. The
typical profile consists of 14 inches of dark grayish brown loam grading to clay loam in the lower
section, followed by 26 inches of dark gray loam. The upper 10 inches of the subsoil is dark
grayish brown loam followed by 44 inches of gray clay loam with brownish mottles (Ressel
1981:58). The sliver of Arents, loamy, are gently undulating loamy soils that have been
smoothed and reclaimed after sand and gravel mining. These are stratified in shades of red,
brown, and yellow and mainly consist of varied amounts of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The
dominant texture is sandy clay loam, but fine sand, loamy fine sand, and fine sand loam is
common (Ressel 1981:17â18).

CLIMATE
In general, the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area has a mild, subtropical, humid/subhumid
climate with hot summers and cool winters (Larkin and Bomar 1983). Summer temperatures
average 83ï°F, with an average daily maximum of 94ï°F and a record high of 113ï°F in 1980.
Winter temperatures average 47ï°F, with an average daily minimum of 37ï°F and a low of -8ï°F on
record in 1899. The average yearly rainfall of 32 inches is seasonally biased toward a maximum
in April/May and a minimum in July/August. Much of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy
thunderstorms. Snowfall is common but in short durations (Ressel 1981).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Tarrant County is part of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950). Almost the entire county falls
within the Blackland Prairie, one of several tall grass prairies present in the northcentral part of
Texas. Blackland Prairie vegetation is dominated by uplands grasses; woodlands are restricted to
stream courses and river bottoms. Before Historic-period disturbances, the wooded areas would
have been covered by a water-oak/elm/hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and
shallow water marshes and ponds. Today, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm,
American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash,
sycamore, pecan, bois dâarc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, and coral-berry. Among the grasses
expected to occur within the prairie setting are little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
dallisgrass, hairgrama switchgrass, rescuegrass, bermudagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Torrey silver bluestem, eastern gamagrass, Virginia wildrye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, and yankeeweed (Coffee et al. 1980). Most of this vegetation was also probably present
in prehistoric times.
The faunal community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Among the wildlife that would have previously inhabited the
region would have been openland species (bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow,
cottontail, and red fox), woodland species (wild turkey, ruffled grouse, woodcock, thrushes,
woodpeckers, squirrel, gray fox, raccoon, and deer), wetland inhabitants (ducks, geese, heron,
shore birds, muskrat, mink, and beaver), and rangeland species (antelope, deer, sage grouse,
meadowlark, and lark bunting), along with various species of reptiles (Coffee et al. 1980).

CULTURAL SETTING

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Prehistoric Context
Despite a long history of archaeological research in Northcentral Texas and the Southern Plains
(Krieger 1946; Prewitt 1981, 1985), as well as several more recent summary overviews (Hofman
et al. 1989a, 1989b; Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Vehik 1994), the chronological framework
for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed. The available data allow the delineation
of only a generalized chronology. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, although the
overall regional applicability of the phases recognized there are still in some dispute. Prikryl
(1990) presented a chronological sequence of six periods, but he relied almost entirely on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
upper Trinity River basin. Despite this, chronological data from recent excavations at Ray
Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake reportedly conform well to his suggested sequence (Ferring
and Yates 1997).
The chronology presented here (Table 1) is largely taken from the introduction to the regional
preservation plan for the Prairie-Savanna Archeological Region, of which the upper Trinity River
basin is a part (Prikryl 1993). The application of this sequence to the study area is based
primarily on investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988). A brief summary of the
adaptations and archaeological remains associated with these periods is presented hereafter.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9950/9500â6500/6000 B.C.) generally
includes the remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the
immediate post-Pleistocene periods (for reviews of this period relevant to Northcentral Texas, see
Hofman 1989a; Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian
occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile

points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer
and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example
of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968).
Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best-known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths and a low density of artifacts including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalous early age
for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years before present [yrs B.P.]), later work by the Smithsonian
Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the
occupation there. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring ligniteâeither as a fuel in
these hearths or as an inadvertent inclusionâcontaminated the radiocarbon samples.
Consequently, the usually accepted date of 10,000â12,000 yrs B.P. for Clovis period occupations
is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
A spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas
is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989). The discovery of this site, buried approximately 7â8 meters
(m; 23â26 ft) below the top of the Elm Fork floodplain just below the Lake Ray Roberts dam,
suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by
examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern floodplain situations. Ferring has
suggested that Paleo-Indian sites similar to the Aubrey site may occur below 18 m (59 ft) of
sediment in the Dallas area (Institute for the Study of Earth & Man [ISEM] 1990).
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group
mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of
presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith
8

1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna
by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar faunal
species in Northcentral Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Slaughter and Hoover
1963), has resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that âbig game huntingâ was part of
the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. However, the recent important
excavations at the Aubrey site have indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game
animals alone. Rather, the occupants of the site used the entire range of prairie and forest species,
including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989; Ferring and Yates
1997). Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, their exploitation has not been
substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging
subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern Woodlands
and that the focus on now-extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation
remains to be documented; Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general, the Clovis people
probably employed âvery flexible adaptive strategies.â
A variety of early points has been found in the general Northcentral Texas region, largely in
surface contexts, and it is clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca.
9500 to 7000 B.C. Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Golondrina,
and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens, have been found in the region
(Yedlowski et al. 1998).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6500/6000 B.C. and A.D.
700. As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early,
Middle, and Late âsubperiods,â has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the
Early Archaic has been dated from 6500/6000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700 (recent overviews that cover the
Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1985, 1990).
Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material.
In fact, the initial treatments of the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas that defined the
Carrollton and Elam foci (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954) were based upon materials from such
mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as
being acceptable for this area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and
Ferring 1986). General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in
Northcentral Texas suggest increasingly complex settlement systems, increasing population size
and density, gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories (Prikryl
1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6500/6000â4000 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and
widely distributed sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly
defined territories, with a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986;
Story 1985:35, 39). Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in northcentral Texas are poorly
documented, and no sites with isolable Early Archaic components in this area are known (Prikryl
1990). Based on surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized hunting-andÂ­
gathering economy during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization, and
âlittle in the way of recognized territorial boundariesâ (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point forms
that may be associated with the Early Archaic in northcentral Texas include Early Split Stemmed
and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
9

In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in northcentral Texas (4000â
1500 B.C.) is even less well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components
than for any other period, but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of
regional cultural differences by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that
may be associated with the Middle Archaic consist of the Basal Notched group (which includes
Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice), Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story
1990:Figure 31). An intact Middle Archaic component was identified at the Calvert site
(41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997), and it is summarized as follows.
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier Middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the [Middle Archaic] period are evident [Ferring and Yates 1997:305].

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (ca. 1500 B.C.âA.D. 700). Evidence for this can be found in an apparent increase in the
number of Late Archaic sites, a greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of
decreasing group mobility (Prikryl 1990). At the same time, interregional contact may have
diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to unequal
destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing use of
all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic period
occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of buried
sites are also known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring 1990:51). Dart points that may
be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997), respectively, just to the east and roughly 30 miles to the north of the project area,
indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages apparently left
by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time
period and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous
times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations exploited a mix
of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbits, turtles, and mussels being
primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). In summarizing the results of investigations
at a number of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates (1997:305) state:
The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr bp) of
the [Late Archaic] period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits
our understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these are
recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are clear.
Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the [Middle
Archaic] period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points,
while local raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite
quite good resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses.

10

The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland Creek
and Chambers Creek drainages just south the Dallas (Bruseth and Martin 1987) also suggests that
important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period.
Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent
documentation.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca. A.D. 700â
1600/1700) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of
this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the
west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be
divided into an early and a late phase: the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period, and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1600/1700 and
is associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarized the results of that research as follows:
There are no woodland-like sites in north central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland influence or
contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were found with
LPI [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These appear
to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation compared to the
Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these occupations are
essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological information, rather than
environmental change, probably is the factor behind the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr. bp. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
11

shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a âmiddle subperiodâ of the
Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that arrow points with
straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies three sites or site
areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle subperiodâthe
Cobb-Pool site; Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek in the middle
Brazos River drainage; and Area F at the Haleyâs Point site (34MA15) on the Red River (Brown
et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that maize is common
at Haleyâs Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are representative of a
relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial dependence on
agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication 1999).
Although no one can dispute the presence of domesticates at Cobb-Pool and Haleyâs Point, the
lack of any evidence for Late Prehistoric agriculture at Ray Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake
leaves open the question of how extensive and how early this agricultural pattern was. Maize
agriculture is known to have been present at Late Prehistoric sites along the East Fork, based on
the recovery of maize from the Hogge Bridge, Butler Hole, and Campbellâs Hole sites earlier
during this century (Stephenson 1952:305), but the dating of these remains has always been
uncertain (Prikryl 1990:77). As late as 1993, the available data allowed Fritz (1993:241) to state
that, apart from Cobb-Pool, Late Prehistoric sites in Northcentral Texas seemed to show a
generalized adaptation in which the most important plant foods were nuts, wild seeds, fruits, and
the problematic, possible tuber that might be a species of Psoralea. Since then, several small
projects have shed additional light on the introduction of maize horticulture into Northcentral
Texas. The Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork
of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by AMS analysis of bone
collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present, and a stable carbon isotope ratio of -21.6â° indicates
that the groupâs diet contained little or no maize (Cliff et al. 1996; cf. Lynott et al. 1986:Figure 2).
More recently, a disturbed burial (41DL373), located on Spring Creek (a tributary of Rowlett
Creek), was dated by AMS analysis of bone collagen to cal. A.D. 1155 (1220) 1275, with a stable
carbon isotope ratio of -17.8â° (Peter and Clow 2000). This value is similar to stable carbon
isotope values believed to represent the initial introduction of maize agriculture in New York around
A.D. 1000 (van der Merwe and Vogel 1977) and is comparable to values of -18.0â° to -20.0â° for
initial maize-consuming Caddo populations in Arkansas (Rose and Hoffman 1989). Assuming that
(1) these carbon isotope ratios directly reflect changes in the C4 plant contribution to the human
diet (see Herz 1990 for a discussion of other possibilities), and (2) these burials are representative
of more regional changes in prehistoric dietary patterns, then maize horticulture may have been
introduced into northcentral Texas around A.D. 1200.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; conversely, this
same evidence may simply indicate that divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by different
groups in the Dallas area.

Protohistoric and Historic Native American Period
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1600/1700 to 1800/1850s has been designated the
Protohistoric/Historic Indian period. Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European
presence in the Southwest and on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at bestâCoronado in
1540â1541, the Rodriguez-Chamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582â1583, among several
others. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains,
although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and there are only brief records of
journeys into or through the area (Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the
beginning of the nineteenth century that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplaceâthe result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish
in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States
in 1803. Prior to about 1725â1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western
portion of the Southern Plains, known as the High Plains, but after this time the area was
increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern
Plains, within the area now known as the Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes
became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman 1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the earlier part of the period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that this period in
Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see
Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of the
eastern margin of the Great Plains, which includes Northcentral Texas, were Caddoan-language
speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is
worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of
the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same group
as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth century,
apparently located at that time âon the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity
rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). If the
prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers,
it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as
the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in
Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups,
in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were probably absorbed by the
united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such
as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The term Wichita has been used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including the
Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and Kichai, many of whom apparently had entered
the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern Nebraska, to
escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita were true Plains
Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and bison hunting. They
occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which they conducted
seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas River in
northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their villages to
southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the Sabine
and Neches rivers in Texas, and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos rivers. In
1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages was on the
13

Salt Fork of the Brazos on the Lower Plains west of Dallas (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll
1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843
and with the United States government in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In
Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855, when the
Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in
company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). As a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, the groups
were subsequently removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll
1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War but returned to
Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
The Comanche were a Shoshonean group originally residing along the upper Yellowstone and
Platte rivers. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, they left those areas and began to
migrate onto the Southern Plains, where they drove a wedge between the Apache to the west
(driving them farther south and west) and the Pawnee and Wichita to the east. By the early
nineteenth century, their range was at its greatest extent, stretching from central Kansas to Austin,
and from Oklahoma City westward to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The most important divisions
of the Comanche included the Yamparika (root-eaters), who ranged along the Arkansas River; the
Kotsoteka (buffalo-eaters), who were just to the south of the Yamparika; the Nokoni (wanderers),
who occupied the territory along the Red River; the Quahadi (Antelope People), located on the
High Plains; and the Penateka (honey-eaters), who were the southernmost Comanche in Texas,
ranging from the Edwards Plateau to the headwaters of the Central Texas rivers (Lipscomb 2011;
Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). Their earliest known raid in Texas was in 1758, when they
helped in the destruction of the mission of San SabÃ¡ de la Santa Cruz in present-day Menard
County; and for the next 117 years, they waged intermittent warfare first against the Spanish, then
the Mexicans, the Texans, and, finally, the United States (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). The
Comanche were nomadic Plains hunters, whose lifestyle depended upon the bison as a source of
meat and raw material for clothing, shelter, etc., and upon the horse as a means of hunting and
transport. The Comanche were signatories to the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the United States
in 1867, in which they agreed to cede all of their territory except for a 5,546-square-mile
reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Following a general uprising by the Comanche and
Kiowa in 1874, they were defeated by the United States army in 1875 and permanently confined
to their Oklahoma reservation (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385).
Archeological remains that can be associated with these groups are rare compared to the remains
of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, and in Dallas County itself, little
evidence of these Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American
sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). In actuality, all of these groups are better
represented in the regions that surround the upper Trinity River valley.
Groups of the Wichita Confederacy, being Plains Villagers, have left much more substantial
archeological remains. A number of villages belonging to historic Wichita groups have been
identified and investigated in Oklahoma, in Northcentral Texas, and along the boundary of
Northcentral Texas and Northeast Texas (Bell 1984; Fox 1983:41â46). On the basis of
excavations at the Pearson site in Rains County, Texas, due east of Dallas County, the NorteÃ±o
focus has been proposed for these historic Wichita components (Duffield and Jelks 1961). The
most extensive archeological work has been done at several sites along the Red River in Texas
and Oklahoma, near the present-day Texas town of Spanish Fort, northwest of Dallas County,
which is believed by some to be the site of the village attacked by Parilla in 1759 (Bell et al.
14

1967). The excavations at the Longest site (34Jfâ1) in Oklahoma documented the presence of a
fortified enclosure and circular grass-covered lodges. Artifactual material recovered from these
Wichita sites shows a mixture of artifacts of Native American manufacture and of materials
obtained in trade with the French or the Spanish. Artifacts of Native American manufacture
include triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), thick end scrapers on flakes,
diamond-shaped beveled knives, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison scapula hoes,
pottery elbow pipes, and Womack Engraved pottery. Trade artifacts found to be present at
Wichita sites include metal knives and knife handles; axes; splitting wedges; kettle fragments;
awls; chisels; scissors; buttons; flintlock gun parts; bullets and shot; bridle parts; metal ornaments
such as bells, finger rings, and bracelets; and numerous trade beads (Fox 1983:45).
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands north and east of Northcentral Texas. Delaware, Chickasaw,
Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in Northcentral Texas. As the
Comanche and Kiowa attacked the less populated areas, skirmishes and raids were frequent in the
1830s.

Historic Context

Early Texas
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542, when the
remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered modern-day
Texas during an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the
expedition crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the
route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson
1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not
occur until the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the
Red River. The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New
Spain, and they responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance French influence with Native
Americans in East and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France
ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the
security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern
Texas. It has been argued that the severe military defeat inflicted on the Spanish by Wichita and
allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758 put an end to Spanish military and
missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965).
After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, President Thomas Jefferson declared in 1804 that the territory
extended to the Rio Grande, although the boundary of the purchase was not defined (Handbook of
Texas Online 2011). Texas, however, was still predominantly under Spanish control, and the
Spanish government actively encouraged Anglo settlement to act as a northern buffer. Among
the first of the empresarios to bring colonizers into Texas was Moses Austin, who gained
permission in 1820. Austin, however, died before he could fulfill his plans, and it fell to his son,
Stephen F. Austin, to carry through with the actual colony (Gracy 2011). Most of the settlement
occurred in the southern and southwestern parts of Texas, and northern Texas remained virtually
uninhabited.

15

After years of Mexican rule (subsequent to Mexican independence in 1821), differences in
national habits and experiences between Mexican rulers and Anglo American occupants of Texas
exacerbated. Texans prepared for the struggle for independence from Mexico, with the first of
the skirmishes initiated with the battle of Gonzales in October 1835 and independence achieved
with the battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. Most of the battles took place far to the south of
Northcentral Texas, so present-day Tarrant County was virtually unaffected by the fighting that
established the Republic of Texas, which existed for some 11 years until Texas was annexed to
the United States on December 29, 1845.

History and Development of Tarrant County
The first European American settlers in the region that is now Tarrant County in Northcentral
Texas were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The settlement of Birdâs Fort, established in
1840, was the first permanent settlement in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and was established by
Captain Jonathan Bird. Located along the West Fork of the Trinity River in present-day
Arlington, the fort consisted of a blockhouse and several log buildings and served mostly as a
trading station. Additional families joined the initial occupants of the fort in the fall of 1841, but
the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Birdâs Fort was not used again until the summer of
1843 when Sam Houston, president of the Republic of Texas, attempted to meet with the Indian
tribes and establish a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on September 29, 1843, with
representatives of the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Keechi, Caddo, Ionic, Biloxi, and Cherokee
(Garrett 1972; Sergeant 1953).
Meanwhile, in 1841, the Republic of Texas had granted a large portion of land to the Texas
Emigration and Land Company (TELC), which hoped to encourage settlement of Northcentral
Texas. The grants distributed to settlers by the TELC became known collectively as the Peters
Colony. The majority of the Peters Colony settlers held property north of Dallas, which they
retained in that name until 1852 when disputes between the TELC and the settlers caused some of
the settlers to band together to defend their title to the land they had settled. Twenty-six counties
were eventually carved out of the original Peters Colony, one of which was Tarrant County,
established in 1849 (Knight 1990:18).
On June 6, 1849, the United States Army established Camp Worth on the bluffs overlooking the
Trinity River, near where the Tarrant County Courthouse presently stands. Major Ripley Arnold
selected the site of the installation, which served as a post along the armyâs frontier defense line.
The fortâs location atop a high bluff provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area,
resulting in an increased measure of security (Selcer 2004:4). Despite undergoing a change in
name from âCamp Worthâ to âFort Worthâ in November 1849, the installation at Fort Worth was
not a walled or substantially fortified structure as the name may imply. Soldiers did construct
buildings within the installation, however. In 1853 when the armyâs frontier defense line shifted
west, the army withdrew its troops from Fort Worth and turned the installation over to a
population of less than 100 civilian settlers who moved into the abandoned structures and adapted
them for their own use (Selcer 2004:7â9).
In spite of the fact that the military installation had been abandoned in 1853, the population of
Forth Worth and surrounding communities in Tarrant County rose dramatically during the latter
1850s. This was due largely to the prevalence of water and cheap fertile land. An important step
in connecting the town to a larger transportation network was the commencement of regular stage
16

service from Fort Belknap, northwest of Fort Worth near present-day Newcastle, to Dallas in
1857 (Selcer 2004:10â11). The first stage line to connect with Fort Worth was the United States
Mail Stage Line in 1856, and in 1858, Fort Worth became an overnight rest stop on the Fort
WorthâJacksboro Stage Line, which connected to the Butterfield Overland Stage that linked St.
Louis to the West Coast (Sanders 1986:24; Schmelzer 1985). In 1860, settlement increased
further and spread from the town center (just west of the present-day location of the Tarrant
County Courthouse) to the south and northeast along the bluffs.
During the Civil War, the population in Tarrant County declined and development was stagnant.
Nonetheless, after the war, unlike many former Confederate strongholds, the county began to
reshape its economy and identity relatively quickly with the beginning of cattle drives and the
coming of the railroad (Roark 1991:5; Sanders 1986:29). Following the warâs end, a great
demand for Texas beef developed in northern states because the war had depleted the livestock
population in that region (Campbell 2003:297). In April 1866, the first contract cattle drive from
South Texas to Missouri passed through Fort Worth. The town served as a final stopover for the
cattle drives heading from South Texas to shipping depots in Oklahoma and Kansas along the
Eastern Trail. Fort Worth was transformed into a bustling frontier town. The city and county
population quickly grew and even greater growth was on the horizon with the arrival of the Texas
& Pacific Railroad (T&P) in 1876 (Sanders 1986:29).
Throughout Texas, the railroads catalyzed the statewide population growth and economic boom
after the Civil War and continuing through the early twentieth century, when the railroads were
integral to the distribution of local products (Campbell 2003:309). Railroads proved essential to
the expansion of the countyâs industrial growth, therefore essential to its long-term financial
stability. The T&P reached Fort Worth on July 19, 1876, five years after Congress granted it a
charter to construct its transcontinental line (Selcer 2004:20). The T&P was the only railroad in
the state of Texas to operate under a charter granted by the federal government (Campbell
2003:306). Each of the industries that developed in Fort Worth and the surrounding areas in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuriesânamely, the meatpacking industry, lumber yards,
and oil manufacturing companiesârelied on the railroad system in order to thrive.
Although the coming of the railroad meant growth and development for many towns in Tarrant
County, other areas developed without the railroad, establishing agriculturally based
communities. Between 1890 and 1900, nearly 1,000 new farms were established in the county,
relying on the principal crops of cotton, corn, and wheat. Farms varied in size from 40 to 640
acres or more, with the majority of larger tracts located on the west side of the county and
primarily used for grazing (Hawker et al. 1924:868â869).
With the varied successful industries in the county, the early 1900s proved to be a period of
steady growth. By 1911, Fort Worth had outgrown its system of artesian wells, prompting city
officials to impound Lake Worth in northwest Tarrant County. The reservoir provided the
growing area with an added water supply and better fire protection. In 1917, the U.S. entered
World War I, and the army established Camp Bowie in Arlington Heights, which was responsible
for training 100,000 men. Also located in the county were three Army Air Corps airfields:
Hicks, 9 miles north of Fort Worth; Benbrook, 9 miles west of Fort Worth; and Barron, near
Everman (Handbook of Texas Online 2009a).

17

After the war, Tarrant County continued to thrive. More than 250 commercial establishments
existed throughout the area, and agriculture remained prosperous. However, in 1929, the stock
market crashed and the onset of the Great Depression affected Tarrant County, as it did the entire
nation. The true effects of the economic collapse did not affect the county until 1932 because of
the amount of construction underway. After 1932, however, construction projects slowed and
road funds were exhausted. By 1940, 16 percent of the population in the county either was out of
work or was participating in public emergency work (Handbook of Texas Online 2009a).
It was only after the U.S. entered World War II that the effects of the depression eased. Many
people joined the armed forces or worked in factories that supported the war effort. In 1941, the
army acquired 500 acres in Tarrant County, on the west side of Fort Worth near White
Settlement, for the construction of a bomber factory operated by Consolidated Vultee Aircraft
Corporation (McGown 2003:99). The plant was identical to those in Oklahoma and Georgia;
however, an extra 29 feet were added to the building, making it the longest aircraft plant in the
country. Adjacent to the plant, the army built Tarrant Field, renamed Carswell Air Force Base in
1942, to train B-24 pilots. The Strategic Air Command operated out of Carswell Air Force Base
from the 1940s to the 1990s. Today, the base is known as the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve
Base Fort Worth (NAS JRB Fort Worth) and is operated by the U.S. Navy (Handbook of Texas
Online 2009b).
Following World War II, the transportation network in Tarrant County was greatly improved.
Built during the apex of 1950s federally funded highway projects, the Dallas-Fort Worth
Turnpike (now part of Interstate Highway [IH] 30) opened in 1957, running approximately
parallel and just south of the original T&P line (now Union Pacific). The turnpike intersected
IH 35W, which together with the complex of feeder roads and on-ramps at the interchange,
became popularly known as the âmixmaster.â In 1970, Fort Worth and Dallas were combined
into one standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), and in 1972, the term âmetroplexâ was
copyrighted as the regionâs name (Cashion 2006:130). A network of interstates and tollways now
connects the two cities and provides access to the many smaller cities that make up the metroplex.
The major advances in transportation have affected the entire area, providing an influx of people,
goods, and materials.

Walnut Creek and the Development of Mansfield
The area east of Mansfield along Walnut Creek would have certainly attracted the Anglo
Americans who settled Tarrant County during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Originating near todayâs town of Alvarado in Johnson County, Walnut Creek winds its way
northeastward through southern Tarrant County to drain into Joe Pool Lake (Figure 3). Water,
trees, wild game, and nearby towns offered early settlers both the necessities crucial to survival
and the amenities that made life enjoyable. Early deed records, which often used trees for
boundary markers, reveal that Walnut Creek was lined with post oak, cottonwood, Spanish oak,
elm, and box elder. For the most part, however, the written record on Walnut Creek is silent.
Originally called Cedar Bluff Creek, it was known as Walnut Creek by at least 1895 when the
Sam Streetâs Map of Tarrant County was published (Tarrant County Deed Records; Figure 4).

18

Regardless of its name, the creek is the very reason that the nearby town of Mansfield was
established. Southeast Tarrant County was first populated by European Americans in the late
1840s. Charles Turner, an early settler, built a mill along the creek in 1853. A few years later,
Julian Feild, a prominent Fort Worth citizen, purchased acreage in southeast Tarrant County that
included Turnerâs mill. In 1858, Feild and his business partner, Ralph Man (who also relocated
to the Mansfield area), rebuilt the original mill. The new mill was a three-story, brick structure
that stood on the southeast corner of present-day Main and Broad streets. It remained in
operation until 1910 (Austin 2010; Hart 2010; Mansfield Historical Museum n.d.).
Gristmills provided an important service for farmers and thus became popular places to conduct
business and meet with other farmers. Feild and Manâs mill was quite lucrative, prompting them
and other entrepreneurs to establish a variety of businesses, including a bank and merchandise
store. During the Civil War, the mill provided flour and meal to Confederate troops. After the
war, Feild entered into a contract with the U.S. government to supply several Army forts and
reservations with milled grain (Austin 2010).
Walnut Creek was not only a means to survival or economic gain, it was also an area of scenic
beauty and was used for religious activities during the nineteenth century and continuing into the
first half of the twentieth century. Ralph Man built a house near the creek sometime before 1868.
The First Baptist Church of Mansfield, established in 1886, held baptisms in the creek on Jake
Backâs property (just south of the present Williams property project area) (McDonald 2010;
Mansfield Historical Society 1996).
Throughout the 1800s, Mansfield continued to grow. The name itself stems from the two
founders, Man and Feildâwith Feildâs name eventually converted to the more familiar âField.â
In 1885 the Forth Worth and New Orleans Railroad was chartered and passed through Mansfield,
prompting even greater economic growth. Mansfieldâs growth as a town also benefitted the
surrounding rural area. Farms and ranches to the east of Mansfield, where the Williams property
exists, were connected to one another, Mansfield, and surrounding towns by a series of wagon
roads. Gins, flowing wells, and houses dotted the landscape. The 1895 Sam Streetâs Map of
Tarrant County indicates that a gin was located on the south side of Walnut Creek just below the
Williams property. Farmers grew a variety of crops, including wheat, corn, cotton, and oats.
Livestock included cattle, chickens, turkeys, and pigs. Although Mansfield would have been an
obvious source for goods; services; marketing produce; and religious, educational, and social
activities, the rural population was surrounded by small towns that offered similar services and
amenities. The area that includes the Williams property was located almost halfway between
Mansfield and the town of Webb, which developed in the 1880s when property owner, Dan
Zuefeldt, decided to build a general merchandise store and cotton gin. The cotton gin remained in
operation until 1981, though it burned twice and was rebuilt on the same site each time (near
todayâs intersection of Mansfield-Webb Road and Zuefeldt Drive in Arlington) (Mansfield
Historical Museum n.d.). According to one nearby-property owner, cotton farmers in and near
the project area frequented the Webb Gin because it was closer than any other cotton gin (B.
Ervin, personal communication 2011). Other towns located in southeast Tarrant County that
offered services included Gertie, Sublett, and Hellandvilleâall eventually absorbed by other
cities (Hart 2010; Mansfield Historical Museum n.d.; Mansfield Historical Society 1996; 1895
Sam Streetâs Map of Tarrant County).

21

By 1900, the population of Mansfield had reached 700 and the town included the Mansfield Male
and Female College, churches, doctorâs office, stores, and a number of stately homes (Hart 2010;
McDonald 2010; Mansfield Historical Museum n.d.; Mansfield Historical Society 1996). Outside
of town, near the Williams property area, farmers were prospering. The family of Mr. Robert
Ervin grew peaches, apricots, oats, corn, and cotton; raised sheep, hogs, and milk cows; and kept
beehives. They hunted squirrel and rabbit, and they fished in Walnut Creek for catfish, perch,
bass, and rock bass. Several families, including the Ervins, erected two-story kit houses from
Sears, Roebuck & Co. (Figure 5) (B. Ervin, personal communication 2011). Although Walnut
Creek provided for residents in various ways, it could also wreak havoc on the Mansfield area.
On April 25, 1922, eight inches of rainfall caused the creek to flood. A wooden bridge that
spanned the creek at North Street was destroyed. Several railroad laborers drowned when the
boxcar they were living in washed downstream (Mansfield Historical Museum n.d.). As the
specific history of the Williams property suggests, however, Walnut Creekâas a source of
livelihood, spiritual renewal, and tragedyâbecame more and more valued as a place reserved for
recreation, tranquility, and family bonding during the late twentieth century.

The Williams Property History
The land currently associated with the Williams property includes acreage patented to Grievous
(also spelled Grievious) Ray and a small portion of the William Bratton survey to the west and
adjacent to the Ray survey. Grievous Ray was granted the 640-acre survey December 31, 1845.
Census records indicate that Ray did not occupy the land that spanned both the north and south
sides of Walnut Creek. Early on, Rayâs 640-acre survey was partitioned off and sold to various
buyers. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth
century, the original survey was subdivided into five tracts (2, 2A, 3, 3A, and 4; Figure 6) with
each tract undergoing multiple transactions (Tarrant County Deed Records).
On August 22, 1868, Ray, living in Williamson County, hired attorney A. G. Walker to convey
120 acres of his property north of Walnut Creek to Gabriel Franklin Chrisman for the sum of
$220.00. Chrisman was born April 23, 1832, and had served in the Confederate Army. He was
married to Mary A. Chrisman and together they had six children. Gabriel and Mary Chrisman
owned property from other surrounding surveys, including acreage within the Jacob Back survey
south of Rayâs survey, but their sum total of land holdings is unclear. On October 5, 1895, they
sold 36Â¾ acres from the Ray survey (and within the Williams property area; Tract 3) to Thomas
J. Ragland for $918.75 (Mansfield Historical Society 1996; Tarrant County Deed Records).
Thomas Ragland was born April 5, 1805, in Virginia, making his way as a young man to
Kentucky where he met and married Isabella Edwards (1811â1898). Thomas and Isabella had
seven girls and one boy, Joseph Henry. Traveling by wagon train, Ragland and his family arrived
in Dallas in 1852. Within a few weeks, they settled on the W. G. Logan surveyânorth and
adjacent to the Ray survey. Ragland appears in the 1880 census, at which time, he was listed as a
76-year old farmer, living with his wife who was 60 years old and their 26-year old daughter,
Sarah. Their house also appears on the 1895 Sam Streetâs Map of Tarrant County, as does that of
Raglandâs son who owned a house south of his parentâs home. Thomas and Isabellaâs only son
met a tragic end. Apparently, in a dispute over his parentâs estate, he was shot and killed in 1898
by a brother-in-law (GLO Map 1942; Mansfield Historical Society 1996; U.S. Census 1880).

22

Thomas and Isabella Raglandâs ownership of the parcels now associated with the Williams family
property was short lived. Within a year of purchasing the 36Â¾-acre parcel, Thomas J. and
Isabella Ragland sold it to their son-in-law, J. C. Talley (also spelled Tally) on April 3, 1896, for
the same price they had paid. John Talley, originally from Tennessee, and his wife, Bettie G.
(born in Texas), were farmers. In 1900, their 14-year old son, Joseph P. A., resided with them.
The Talleys amassed a fair amount of land within the Mansfield area and it remained in the
family for a number of years. An 1895 map shows the J. C. Talley home located south of Walnut
Creek on the Ray survey. The Talley house was not far from a flowing well and gin (both located
south of Walnut Creek) (Mansfield Historical Society 1996; Tarrant County Deed Records; U.S.
Census 1900).
John Talley died in 1924 and his wife died in 1931. Upon Bettie Talleyâs death, the Talley family
holdings were divided between their two childrenâJoseph P.A. (a single male) and Mary E.
(Talley) Roberts. Mary was 23 years old in 1930 and married to Dee Roberts (26 years old).
They farmed at least some portion of her parentâs land and had a six-month-old son named John
L. A 21-year-old boarder by the name of Tucker Coel [? last name illegible] was also living in
their house. When their mother died, Joseph P. A. Talley inherited more than 119 acres, and his
sister, Mary, inherited nearly 200 acres. Joseph also relinquished all rights to the 36Â¾-acre plot
(within the Williams property boundary) to his sister (Tarrant County Deed Records; U.S. Census
1930).
Mary and Dee Roberts quickly sold Tract 3 (the 36Â¾-acre plot), along with another parcel (Tract
2A) that makes up the Williams property, to Arrease Harris, Essie B. Harris, and Gertha Lee
Harris in April 1935. The Harrises paid $700.00 for Tract 3. From this point forward, these two
tracts continued to be sold as independent parcels but followed the same chain of ownership.
There is a gap in the deed records from 1935 to 1946, but in 1946, these two parcels belonged to
Robert Johnson, who conveyed them to R. H. and Mary Ruth Blue. In 1952, Elmer and LaVida
Ferry purchased the properties, but sold them to Alfred Brown in 1956. Elmer W. Oliver (fatherÂ­
in-law to Kelly Williams, Sr.) purchased the properties in 1962 (Tarrant County Deed Records).
The above follows the history of only a portion of the Williams property. Other parcels out of the
Grievous Ray survey and a portion of the William Bratton survey also underwent numerous
transactions. When Elmer Oliver decided to purchase rural property, four of the five tracts
already belonged to a single personâAlfred H. Brown. For reasons unknown, Brown began
acquiring tracts in 1956. He purchased Tract 2 from Katie Ratcliff, Tract 2A from Elmer A.
Ferry, Tract 3 from Elmer A. Ferry, and Tract 3A from Clayton C. Thomas. Oliver first
purchased Tract 4 from Imogene Dorrace et al. in 1961, before subsequently purchasing Brownâs
four tracts in 1962. Oliver, a luggage salesman from Fort Worth, wanted a place where he could
work the land and relax with his family upon retirement. His wife had grown up in Mansfield,
making the area along Walnut Creek an attractive spot, despite the heavy undergrowth that took
hours of labor to clear. For the next several years, Oliver and his wife, Myrtle Ilera Fowler
Oliver, transformed the land into a place where they, their children, and their grandchildren could
enjoy one another and the natural world that surrounded them. Interviews with Williams family
members attest to endless hours of exploring the creek as children and continuing that activity as
adults with their own children (Williams family, personal communication 2011).
With the passing of Elmer Oliver on November 11, 1977, the Williams property passed into the
hands of his wife, Myrtle Oliver, in a signed affidavit dated September 10, 1980. Upon her death,
June 1, 1989, the property passed into the hands of Elmer and Myrtleâs three daughters. Their
25

middle daughter, Marianne and her husband, Kelly Williams Sr., bought the other two sistersâ
parcels in 1992. As they had in the past, they and their seven children continued to visit the farm.
As the Williams children grew into adulthood, they too introduced their children to the wonders
of the land. Before Marianne Oliver Williams passed away, it was her wish that the land she so
cherished be available to all who lived and visited Mansfield. That dream became a reality in
2010 when Kelly Dan Williams, Sr., deeded the property to Cftr-11, Inc., for the city of
Mansfield Park Facilities Development Corporation (Tarrant County Deed Records; Williams
family, personal communication 2011).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE STUDY AREA
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) indicates that two archaeological sites are recorded within a 1-mile (mi; 1.6 kilometer
[km]) radius of the proposed park. These sites, 41TR38 and 41TR48, were identified as part of
the large surveys conducted in 1977 and 1978 (Skinner and Connors 1979) and 1979 and 1980
(Raab 1982) by Southern Methodist University for the future Joe Pool Lake (originally named
Lakeview Lake). Site 41TR38 was recorded as a historic metal bridge crossing Walnut Creek
about 1.2 km (0.75 mi) east of this project property. The bridge is described as a âsingle span
metal truss of the pony type which is characterized as by having no lateral bracing between the
top chordsâ (Skinner and Connors 1979:32). It was built of bolt and rivet construction, but no
date of construction was known. The site was revisited in 1979/1980 and it was determined that
it had been relocated to this present location and substantially modified, making its eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) questionable (Raab 1982:128). A
suggested use for the bridge was to make it a pedestrian walkway for access to a park facility.
Site 41TR48 was recorded as a historic site containing two houses on the south side of Walnut
Creek; it is approximately 1.7 km (1.1 mi) east of the current project area. The structures were
thought to date from the late 1800s through the early 1900s (Skinner and Connors 1979:35).
Skinner and Connors (1979:58) made general recommendations for evaluation of the structures
by an architectural historian and that standing structures should be preserved in situ, by
relocation, or a carefully developed study program including photographs and artifact analysis.
The site was revisited during the 1979/1980 SMU investigations, during which it was found that
the Marrs family had owned the land since at least 1859 and that the family still lived in the house
during the early part of the twentieth century. The site contained a main house, a secondary
structure immediately behind it, a fallen cellar, a well, and several scatters of trash (Raab
1982:153). The house was unique for this area in that it was a two-story, balloon frame with
mortice and tenon joints; perhaps the earliest in the area. The Marrs site was recommended for
full documentation regarding the Marrs family, with test excavations also recommended near the
house and in one of the artifact scatters to provide information on the nature of the artifact
assemblage and the timeframe(s) represented (Raab 1982:155). In 1985, the site was investigated
again by SMU as part of the testing and mitigation for the lake construction (Jurney et al. 1988).
Nine archaeological sites have been recorded along the entire stretch of Walnut Creek. All of
these sites were recorded as part of the investigations associated with the construction of Joe Pool
Lake, though there have been other survey investigations along the creek in and around
Mansfield; otherwise, very little is known about the archaeology on this creek. Only one of those
sites, 41TR37, is a prehistoric site. Recorded in 1977 as a prehistoric site of unknown age, the
26

site was initially identified when the landowner excavated a water line trench and found five
scrapers and four large gray chert flakes. The site, situated on a terrace slope between Bowman
Branch and Walnut Creek, was tested during the 1985 mitigation phase conducted by SMU prior
to construction of Joe Pool Lake (see Peter and McGregor 1988). Only two other flakes and
several historic artifacts were recovered during test excavations. The limited number and type of
prehistoric artifacts suggests that this may have been a cache locality. It is puzzling that the
absence of a more dense occupation of the site was not observed, since the location likely offered
a wider variety of resources and was ideal for prehistoric occupation (Peter 1988:129).

27

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

The cultural resources investigation was undertaken with two goals in mind: to determine if
historic and prehistoric archaeological resources occur within the designated project area and to
make recommendations for additional fieldwork necessary to satisfy the cityâs obligations under
the Antiquities Code of Texas.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, Geo-Marine personnel performed a search of the available data sources.
Records maintained by the THC and TARL at the University of Texas at Austin were reviewed to
identify known sites within 1 mi (1.3 km) of the proposed park area. A literature review to obtain
information from previous investigations and data from geologic maps, soil surveys, and aerial
photographs was undertaken. This information was used to determine the locations of all known
archeological sites as well as national and state historic landmarks and historic cemeteries. Of
particular use were historic aerial photographs taken between 1942 and 2008, the 1959 U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5' topographic map (photorevised in 1978), and Sam Streetâs Map
of Tarrant County (1895).
Locating information on the history of rural areas is often times challenging. Nevertheless,
certain documents, files, secondary sources, and interviews were useful in providing a broad
overview of the development of southeast Tarrant County, and more specifically, the Williams
property area. Archival research and interviews were conducted in late 2010 and the first half of
2011. Deed/title and tax research was conducted at the Tarrant County Clerkâs Office and
Tarrant County Tax/Assessor Collectorâs Office; on-line census data was collected at the Plano
Public Library, Haggard Branch. Both deed/title and census information were valuable for the
insight they provided into land use, demographics, and trends in property ownership. Researchers
into Mansfield area history are fortunate to have access to vertical files at the Mansfield
Historical Museum and Heritage Center. Of particular interest were files on Mansfield, Webb,
and Sublett. As a secondary source, the centerâs copy of The History of Mansfield, Texasâmid
1800 to 1965 (1996) compiled by members of the Mansfield Historical Society proved most
helpful in obtaining information on early settlers who populated the town and surrounding rural
area. Finally, though it falls outside the category of âarchival research,â interviews (both oral
29

history and ethnographic) were invaluable for the information provided that so rarely makes it
into the written record. Kelly Williams, Jr., relayed recent history of the area during a walkÂ­
through of the property October 21, 2010. An oral history interview with 10 members of the
Williams family was conducted February 25, 2011, and an ethnographic interview was conducted
with Robert âBobâ Ervin, joined by his mother, Faye Dorris Pressley Ervin, June 21, 2011. The
Ervin family has a long association with Mansfield history, having arrived just after the Civil War
and owning property near the project area for over 100 years.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY
A reconnaissance (walk-over) survey of the acreage complies with the current reconnaissance
survey standards as devised by THC. This includes a general walk-over of the property to
determine the potential for archaeological deposits, what previous impacts may have affected any
cultural resources present, and what additional fieldwork might be necessary prior to park-related
construction. Careful examination of the creek banks along Walnut Creek helped to determine
the potential for containing buried deposits. A policy of âno collectionâ was in effect during this
investigation.
Field notes detailing the survey conditions, landscape features, level of disturbance, and initial
interpretations of the cultural resources were maintained. A complete photographic record was
kept and used to record identified cultural remains, the general topography, environmental
conditions, current land use, and other factors at the time of the survey. All photographs were
documented as to date; digital format was used to record the work conducted under this task.
Photographs were used to document any damage evident to the cultural resources by vandalism,
construction, earth disturbances, or disturbances of any kind.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

INTRODUCTION
The reconnaissance survey of the proposed park property was undertaken in late February.
Though not surveyed systematically, the entire property was carefully walked by two
archaeologists and examined for previous impacts and evidence of archeological deposits. No
shovel tests were excavated at that time.
Ground cover was low and visibility was good over most of the property. Other than
immediately around the new log house (currently occupied by a Williams family member) where
the yard is maintained, much of the property has returned to or has been left in its natural state:
riparian woodland, pecan bottomland, upland woods, and old (agricultural) field (Figure 7).
These distinct areas across the property are what made this property attractive to the City.

REVIEW OF HISTORIC AERIALS AND MAPS
It was fortunate that six aerial photographs covering the project area prior to 2000 were available.
The earliest aerial dates to 1942 followed by 1956, 1964, 1976, 1984, and 1995. Later aerials
dating from 2004, 2008, and 2011 show the extent of the urbanization that has taken place since
1995. All features noted on each aerial are discussed relevant the Tract Numbers on which they
fall, based on the Tarrant Appraisal District Parcel Map (see Figure 6).
On the 1942 aerial, it is obvious that the area is still very much a rural, agricultural area (Figure
8). A structure is noted on Tract 2 where the current main house is situated. In addition, three
possible small outbuildings (?) are noted in Tract 3âtwo along the north-south two-track road in
the field and one near the tree line on the south end of the field. What appears to be a heavily
used entrance from the old wagon road to Tracts 3A and 3 at the northeast/northwest corners of
Tracts 2 and 3 is very evident as are several other two-track roads on Tracts 2 and 3. Most of the
area is forested or in agricultural fields. By the 1956 map, though very grainy, the large pond east
of the main house appears to be under construction and is holding a small amount of water
(Figure 9). The two small structures along the two-track in the field on Tract 3 are no longer
extant, and other than the treed areas becoming more dense, little else has changed since 1942. In
31

1964, the main house appears to have a larger footprint. In addition, the small structure on the
south end of the field in Tract 3 is gone, but a new structure is seen in Tract 3A (Figure 10). The
treed areas are less dense (though this could be due to the time of year the photo was taken) and
there is little evidence of active agricultural activities occurring on any of the tracts.
By the time of the 1976 aerial, the Williams family had owned the property a little over 10 years.
At this point, the second pond is under construction, and the two-tracks have taken on slightly
different alignments (Figure 11). Both of the structures that were evident in 1964 are still evident
in 1976 as wellIn 1984, the trees are much denser, as appears true in surrounding
parcelsï¾agricultural usage has dramatically dropped or stopped all together (Figure 12). By
1995, a new driveway onto the property from Matlock Road is evident and the main house
appears to be larger (Figure 13), and the property across Walnut Creek is in the process of being
developedï¾urbanization is encroaching. By 2004, the property is almost completely surrounded
by residential development and sits alone as a small refuge among the urban expansion around it
(Figure 14). Also, Matlock Road is now a four-lane thoroughfare, except for the strip along this
property.
Also reviewed to help determine where historic resources might be located was the 1895 Sam
Streetâs Map of Tarrant County and the 1959 and 1978 editions of the USGS 7.5' topographic
quadrangle maps. Unfortunately, there are discrepancies between the topographic maps and the
aerials from the same time period. There are no structures falling within the current project
boundary and the creek alignment does not match Sam Streetâs map (Figure 15) likely due to the
fact that Sam Street illustrated waterways as just extant but not drawn to detail.
The 1959 and 1978 topographic maps are identical except for two photo-revised structures (in
purple; Figure 16). Two structures show up on these maps, but only one can be tied back to an
existing structureï¾the structure near the north boundary in Tract 3A. The discrepancies noted
here between the topographic maps and the aerials from about the same periods, 1956 and 1964
in particular, are in the presence of the structure on the far west boundary noted on the
topographic maps, but not seen on either of the aerials, and the addition of the structure in purple,
all on Tract 2. On all of the aerials, there is a structure in this location. Through an oral interview
(Robert Ervin, oral Interview June 2011), we know that there was a structure on the west
boundary in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and it could easily have been built and torn down
between aerial flyovers in 1942 and 1956; it was certainly gone by the time of the purchase in
1960.

RESULTS
Since most of the 61.6-acre Williams property has been left with little or no disturbances since
the Oliver/Williams family acquired the property, it was fairly easy to ascertain where potential
archaeological remains or deposits might be, based on the historic aerials and maps available.
Several extant structures and features were observed during the reconnaissance. First is the main
house or âlogâ cabin where the Oliver/Williams family lived (Figure 17). It is situated about
150 m (490 ft) southeast of the northwest corner of the property off of the well-maintained,
graveled driveway that enters the property from Matlock Road about 120 m (400 ft) south of the
northwest corner of the property. The main house was built in the early 1960s by Elmer W.
Oliver and utilized one wall of the structure that was there when the property was purchased.
That wall is made of logs, hence the âlogâ cabin reference (Figure 18). For the construction of
35

the cabin, the area immediately around it was built up about 3 ft higher than the surrounding
ground to make a flat pad for the house and yard; this is particularly evident on the south and
west sides (notice camper on driveway is lower in Figure 17). This pad is about 10 ft above the
top of the creek (Oral interview, Kelly Williams, Sr., February 2011).
Situated about 75 m (246 ft) to the east of the main house is pond #1. It is slightly egg-shaped
with the large end toward the north. Some of the aerials show that it has a tail that extends
slightly to the northwest when there are greater amounts of water. The 1956 aerial indicates that
this pond was built in mid-1950s, but according to the family, Mr. Oliver built it with partial
funds that came through a government program that helped citizens collect water and preserve the
soil as âan obligation and desire of the government for citizens in the futureâ (Oral interview,
Kelly Williams, Sr., February 2011). It is possible that Mr. Oliver improved this pond by making
it more stable or larger, or that Mr. Williams meant that pond #2, farther to the east, was the one
built with government aid.
Following the trail that goes around the south and east sides of pond #1 and toward the back of
the property, the creek makes its big curve into the property. The path goes along the divide
between the riparian woodland to the east and the upland woods to the west and opens up at pond
#2, located about 170 m (557 ft) east of pond #1 and the beginnings of the open meadow (Figure
19). Based on the 1976 aerial, it was under construction in the mid-1970s. Heavy erosion along
the edges of this pond indicates that subsoil at this location on the property is very near the
surface (Figure 20).

20. Erosion along pond #2; view west

Figure 20. Erosion along pond #2; view west.

About 45 m (147 ft) due east of pond #2 is a windmill and concrete slab (Figure 21). This
windmill, though still mostly intact, was standing when the property was purchased in 1960 but
was not working. The slab was covered with thick leaf mat but appeared to measure about 2-m (6
ft) on the exposed side and was the likely remains of the small outbuilding shown on aerials from
1942 and 1956 in this location. Beyond these remains is the open meadow (Figure 22), where
wildflowers grow all spring and summer. The soil is extremely sandy throughout this area.
An old wagon road used to lie along the north edge of the property. This tract (2A; see Figure 6)
was narrow but is now somewhat indistinguishable due to the residential lots that abut the
property line. However, about 400 m (1312 ft) east of Matlock Road along this previous wagon
road is the remnant entrance into what were tracts 3 and 3A. About 50 m (164 ft) due south of
this entry are the remains of a collapsed structure, footings for a windmill, a sidewalk, and an
extant fence post (Figures 23-25). Photographs taken by the Mansfield Parks Department staff in
2001 or 2002 indicate that the structure was still standing at that time; though it was in an awful
state of disrepair (Figures 26 and 27). Full examination with shovel testing of these features and
the surrounding area was not conducted at this time. Though based on the historic aerials and
maps, these features likely appear on the property (Tract 3A) between 1942 and 1956. It is
assumed that these are the remains of a small tenant house.

A creek bank examination was conducted in a few accessible areas along Walnut Creek. At the
large curve of the creek in the center of the parcel, large bedrock boulders were noted in the bank
as well as in the creek itself (Figure 28). These bedrock outcrops were also found near the top of
the bank in the tree line (Figure 29). On the eastern edge of the property, large bedrock boulders
located in the creek almost form a walkway down its center.
Farther downstream at the curve in the southeast corner of the parcel, the soil is deeper and
sandier than at the curve in the center of the parcel. A profile of the soil indicates a gradual
change in color and texture of the soil with sandier darker soil near the top and sandy clayey
lighter soil nearer the waterline (Figure 30). Unfortunately, no obvious paleosol was observed in
the profile.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The reconnaissance survey of the proposed 80-acre Community Park in Mansfield resulted in
identification of several extant features, but the historic aerial and map review indicated other
potential features. Based on much of the historic and archival research, it appears that the current
park parcel is composed of several tracts that were owned by several families before being
consolidated in the early 1960s by Elmer Oliver, father-in-law of Kelly Williams, Sr., who sold
the land to the city of Mansfield in 2004. Until the purchase in the 1960s, the tracts changed
hands frequently, but it does not appear that the property was used for anything other than
agricultural purposesï¾no apparent long-term residences were noted.
The extant featuresâthe main house or âlogâ cabin, the collapsed structure with associated
sidewalk and windmill footings, and the standing windmill and concrete slabâall appear to date
to sometime after the turn of the twentieth century. None of these features is noted on the 1895
Sam Streetâs Map of Tarrant County but do begin to appear by the 1942 aerial photographs. This
indicates that there was more intensive use of the property after the turn of the century and into
the mid-twentieth century.
Though none of the current archaeological features identified appear to be eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL), it is recommended that
prior to development of the park, intensive survey with shovel testing occur in selective areas
across the parcel (Figure 31). The survey should be concentrated in those locations where known
features have been identified, as well as those locations where historic maps and aerials indicate
potential unidentified features or structures. In particular, this survey would be used to identify,
delineate, and record the full extent of the features and potential deposits surrounding the
collapsed structure in Tract 3A; to determine if deposits exist at the windmill and concrete slab
near pond #2 and identify function; and to determine if archaeological deposits exist in the
vicinity of those potential features or structures as shown on historic aerial photographs; and to
assess all identified deposits and/or remains as to their significance for NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation.
