ABSTRACT
The City of Arlington, Texas is proposing to construct approximately
0.8 miles of soft surface nature trail and a parking lot in the 40-acre site
known as Crystal Canyon Nature Preserve in North Arlington, Tarrant
County, Texas. The preserve is situated in a unique setting in the Eastern
Cross Timbers along the banks of an unnamed intermittent tributary of
the West Fork of the Trinity River that was possibly spring fed. The
preserve is underlain by the Woodbine formation on an upland slope
above the floodplain of the West Fork. The topography of the preserve is
undulating with high knolls, finger ridges and large exposures of
sandstone surrounding the tributary. Given its distance from the West
Fork, and that no archaeological investigations in the area had been
conducted in this type of preserved environmental setting, the prehistoric
site potential was unknown. Numerous archaeological investigations
have been concentrated around the West Fork, and the preserve had
potential for temporary hunting or gathering sites. AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted the archaeological survey of the preserve and despite the
unique environmental and geological setting and the excavation of 14
shovel tests, no cultural materials were located. Therefore, AR
Consultants, Inc recommends that the project should be allowed to
proceed as planned. However, during construction if cultural deposits
are uncovered work should cease in that area immediately and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
contacted.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Arlington is proposing to construct approximately 0.8 miles of soft surface
nature trail and a parking lot in the 40-acre site known as Crystal Canyon Nature Preserve
in North Arlington, Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). The preserve is located on the
south side of Brown Blvd. and west of Collins Street (FM 157) along the banks of an
unnamed intermittent tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River. The nature trail,
benches and footbridges will be installed towards the center of the property around the
unnamed tributary (Figure 2). The parking lot will be located at north end, adjacent to
Brown Blvd. The trail will proceed south out of the parking lot along the top of the
upland edge ridge above the tributary and will loop back around to the parking lot. The
decomposed granite trail will be 8 feet wide and impact only the top 4 inches of soil.
The survey was necessitated because the City of Arlington is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation and the
Texas Historical Commission will act as the State Review Agency. Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5517 was issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this
survey was to locate cultural resources that could be present in the study area and to make
recommendations about how these resources might be impacted by construction.
Relevant federal legislation includes a Section 404 Permit of the Clean Water Act, the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593
“Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of the investigation
follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations
that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area lies in the Eastern Cross Timbers of North Central Texas, and is
surrounded by the Blackland Prairie to the east and west (Dyksterhuis 1946: Figure 1).
The Eastern Cross Timbers is a north-south trending physiographic region, which is
dissected by drainages that flow into the West Fork and the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River. The preserve is located on the Woodbine formation (Bureau of Economic
Geology, 1975). The Woodbine formation consists of an approximately 175 to 250 foot
thick layer of Cretaceous-era sandstone, clay and shale (Bureau of Economic Geology
1975). The study area is approximately 1 kilometer south of the West Fork of the Trinity
River.
The preserve lies within the Birome-Aubrey-Rayex complex, which has a thin layer of
soil, deepest being 50 inches that is intermixed with ironstone, sandstone and angular
gravels (Ressel 1981:Sheet 32). This soil complex is described as being sloping to
moderately steep, and having loamy soils on narrow ridges with large outcrops of
exposed sandstone (Ressel 1981:19). Crosstell fine sandy loam is mapped in the northeast
corner of the study area, and is typically 5 to 63 inches thick above a stratified shale and
loamy material (Ressel 1981:26). A small amount of Crosstell Urban land complex can
be found in the southwest corner of the study area and consists of a layer that is between
4 to 60 inches of soil on top of gray stratified shale.
These soils permit efficient water infiltration, allowing tree roots to penetrate easily, and
provide more moisture to plants (Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999:46). Due to
these characteristics, the Eastern Cross Timbers physiographic region area is biotically
diverse. In addition to blackjack and post oaks, the area has other woody species like
cedar elm, hackberry, pecan, juniper and mesquite. Trees are not the only vegetation in
this thin band of forest surrounded by prairies; there is also a diverse selection of plants
that contribute to the dense brush and open savannahs and provided many resources to
early inhabitants (Diggs et al. 1999:46). The Blackland Prairie has scattered trees found
on high prairies and brushy prairies along the edge of the Cross Timbers. The climate of
Tarrant County is typically mild and is characterized as warm and humid. The average
high temperature is 96˚ in July and the average low temperature is 35˚ in January (Texas
Almanac 1999:264). Tarrant County also averages around 32 inches of rain per year and
has a growing season of 230 days (Texas Almanac 1999:264).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook
and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area
most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of local natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall during this period. The
percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and diagnostics from this
period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and Alba (Prikryl 1990:7983). By the Late Prehistoric II (750-250 BP), there is an increase in buffalo bones in site
deposits and a change in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell, Fresno and Washita
arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this time period are typically
located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major tributaries (Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.

Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s the aboriginal inhabitants of North
Central Texas continued to play an infamous if not important role in the history of that
region. Garrett, a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities
almost depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than
half" (Garrett 1972:24). According to tradition at least, many Indians of several tribes
roamed Tarrant County until the 1860s.
Accounts of the Battle of Village Creek provide give the impression of a high Indian
population. On May 24, 1841, a scout for General Edward Tarrant spotted fresh tracks
and an Indian village, whereupon General Tarrant, Captain John Denton, and Captain
Bourland, seeking reprisal for earlier raids, led a charge. The surprise was complete in the
first village, but chasing down fleeing Indians led to a second and third village with still
another in the distance. Tragically, Denton was killed during the fighting.
According to an official report of the battle, there were 225 lodges, which were thought
to house approximately 1,000 warriors, only half of whom were in camp at the time of
attack (Baker and Cage 1962:29). Captured Indians told the soldiers that half of the men
were away tracking buffalo. These did not seem to be temporary camps, because the
report noted about 300 acres planted in corn and extensive supplies of ammunition, arms,
and blacksmith equipment (Baker and Cage 1962:29; Garrett 1972:27). Realizing that
they were outnumbered, the soldiers returned to the Red River.
Coming from a different background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of
Texas, Sam Houston, realized rapprochement was a preferred tact. In the summer of
1843, a council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes
signed a treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty
provided the needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North Central Texas
area.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, Lonesome Dove and Johnson Station, which were both settled in 1845. Lonesome
Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant
County (Garrett 1972:55). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county
during those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants,
although only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett
1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town, later to
be known as Fort Worth, definitely had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80).
The fort as a military post, however, was relatively short-lived. Faced with the continual
westward movement of the frontier, it was decided that Fort Worth no longer commanded

a strategic place in the line of defense for settlers. Therefore, in September of 1853,
troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local population, which
continued to grow and flourish.
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. The county's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. The railroad reached Dallas in the
early 1870s, and by 1876, it had reached Fort Worth. It was also in 1876 that Arlington
was founded, halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth at a location just north of
Johnson’s Station (Joyner 1976: 80).
Previous Investigations
Two historic maps were used in the assessment of this project. The first is the 1893 Sam
Street’s Tarrant County map; the second is a 1920 soil map of Tarrant County (Street
1893; USDA 1920). The map by Sam Street shows a landscape a world apart from that
which we see today. The relatively undeveloped country is sporadically dotted with
houses and few roads bridged the West Fork. At that time, the Oklahoma, Kansas, and
Texas Railroad (now the Trinity Railroad) did not exist. Both the Sam Street’s map and
the 1920s Soil Map show owner or tenant houses plotted near the proposed nature
preserve, but none were in the actual preserve. Today the area surrounding the study area
is completely urbanized.
A review of the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA 2010) reveals that no
archaeological investigations have been conducted within a kilometer of the study area.
Additionally, all of the studies conducted in the area have been done within the
floodplain of the West Fork, which is a different setting that that of this study area, which
is an upland slope above the floodplain. Extensive archaeological investigations have
been conducted within the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River between Fort
Worth and Dallas over the past twenty years (Peter 1987; Largent, Hunt and Peters 1991;
Ferring 1994; Shaunessy, Jurney and Yedlowski 1992; Ferring and Byers 1996; Ellis
1998; Burson, Hunter, Peter and Shanabrook 2000; Todd 2008; Skinner, Caran and Trask
1999). During these investigations, sites ranging from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
have been recorded. Prehistoric site assemblages consist mainly of mussel shell and
burned rock concentrations that are buried less than a meter and up to 4 meters below the
surface.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The proposed Crystal Canyon Nature Preserve is located on an upland slope on the south
side of the West Fork of the Trinity River valley. Despite this, the area had potential to
contain both prehistoric and historic cultural resources. The research questions below
were developed to examine the potential of the study area.
Based upon the previous investigation, numerous archaeological sites have been recorded
within 5 kilometers of the study area. However, all of these investigations have been done
in different environmental settings along the West Fork and most sites were found the
floodplain and on terraces along the north side of the valley. The Crystal Canyon study
area provides a new and unique setting to look for evidence of prehistoric occupation or
utilization. An intermittent tributary bisects the tract and drains north across the
floodplain to the West Fork channel. This tributary may have been spring fed at one time,
but it now flows intermittently. Gunnar Brune (1981:418-421) does not describe the
preserve area as having a spring, but springs in the Arlington area do originate in the
Woodbine formation.
The natural environment and the topography of the study area could have been appealing
to early inhabitants as a place to hunt or camp temporarily, given the steep elevations
covered by post oak trees and the proximity to water. However, the post oak acorns have
a high tannic acid level, which made processing difficult. Additionally, the bur oaks in
the floodplain had a lower acid level and significantly larger nuts. Acorns in both settings
would have attracted foraging. If prehistoric sites or materials are located, they were
likely temporary campsites or isolated artifacts and this potential is considered low.
Historic sites exist near the project area and historic maps show that the area was sparsely
inhabited in the late 19th century in the level uplands above the West Fork. The
surrounding area has been urbanized greatly since the creation of the maps and historic
structures are likely gone and none are mapped within the study area on the recent USGS
map. If sites are found, they are likely to be historic artifact scatters associated with
farming upslope and this potential was considered low.
Methodology
The field team walked parallel transects spaced 30 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Throughout the course
of the pedestrian survey close attention was paid to the upland slopes, which were
visually inspected for artifacts that may have sloughed off from the continually eroding
upland. Shovel tests were excavated in relatively undisturbed areas, on top of knolls and
ridges and locations with a slope less than 20 percent that contained Holocene-age soil
according to THC standards (n.d). All of areas were defined by an initial pedestrian

survey. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter, and were supplemented by an auger
until bedrock. The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into
smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present. Sandy soils from
the shovel tests were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were
described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to
identify the specific soil colors in each shovel test. Photographs were taken throughout
the survey area using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the preserve followed
by the survey results. Shovel tests are described briefly in the text and are detailed in
Table 1. Conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The preserve is bisected by an intermittent tributary of the West Fork and contains
several drainage ditches that have been eroded down to the bedrock. The tributary snakes
its way around a large portion on the southern half of the preserve and ranged between 60
to 200 cm wide and 20 to 50 cm deep (Figure 3). The terrain was undulating and slopes
throughout the preserve ranged from 15 to 80 percent. On average, the slopes were
between 30 and 50 percent, limiting the possible locations to shovel test. The vegetation
in the preserve was consistent throughout; with most trees being post oaks, along with a
few red oaks, junipers and lots of greenbriar. The ground visibility was highly varied and
ranged between 0 to 100 percent. Ground visibility between 20 to 75 percent was most
common. Towards the center of the study area along the tributary, the ground visibility
was 100 percent as it was mostly exposed sandstone (Figure 4). No Uvalde gravels were
noted in the study area, and the gravel seen throughout the preserve was sandstone,
ironstone and large pieces of gypsum.

Survey Results
Prior to shovel testing the field crew walked three parallel transects in order to identify
any cultural materials that might have been exposed on the surface. The transects began
on the northwest side near the location of the proposed parking lot (Figure 5) and
proceeded to the southern boundary of the study area. The crew then turned north and
walk back along the drainages, before completing the final transects on the eastern side of
the study area. During this initial pedestrian survey, locations for shovel tests were
identified. Shovel testing began on the northwest side of the study area on a level ridge
top (Figure 6). Shovel tests (ST) 1 through 6 were excavated in a zigzag pattern along the
west side of the preserve and tributary. The soils ranged from brown loamy clay to dark
brown sandy loam and very dark gray loamy clay (Table 1). Most of the matrix contained
pieces of ironstone and sandstone. Approximately 30 meters north of the ST3, local kids
have built an impressive bike track, using soil from the area to build ramps (Figure 7).
The earthen ramps were closely inspected for any cultural materials, however none were
identified. The level area southeast of ST3 was not shovel tested due to ground visibility
between 30 and 100 percent along with large exposures of bedrock. ST1 through 4
reached bedrock between 35 and 60 cm below the surface (cmbs), while ST5 and 6 were
much deeper, reaching bedrock between 128 and 145 cmbs. The western half contained
one ridge top that was level enough for shovel testing (ST1 and 2). The remainder of the
shovel tests were at the bases of slopes and near drainages. No cultural materials were
identified on the surface or in the shovel tests on the western half of the study area.
ST7 through 14 were excavated on the east side of the tributary and preserve, working
from the southern boundary north to Brown Blvd. The eastern sided contained more
drainages and locations for shovel testing. ST7 was located at the level foot of the
southern most ridge above the widest and deepest section of the tributary shown in Figure
3. ST7 had very dark brown sandy loam on top of yellowish red clay. Bedrock was
reached at 70 cmbs. ST 8 through 10 were placed on tops of ridges in level areas that

contained soil. The hikes up and down each of these ridges reveal that bedrock was
exposed high up in each slope and throughout the study area (Figure 8).

visibility, and this ground visibility remained between 40 and 80 percent between this
knoll and the knoll where ST14 was excavated. ST12 was excavated on the northern most
ridge and only had 40 cm of fill on top of the bedrock. At the base of the ridge below the
northern most knoll where ST14 was excavated, ST13 was excavated near a small
drainage in the level valley. However, bedrock was only 40 cmbs. ST14 was excavated
on a knoll overlooking Brown Blvd. The top was very eroded and bedrock was only 20

cmbs. The saddle area between the two knolls were ST11 and ST14 was visually
inspected for artifacts, but no shovel tests were dug due to ground visibility between 30
and 100 percent. No cultural materials were identified on the eastern half of the study
area.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the Crystal Canyon Nature Preserve
contained significant historic or prehistoric cultural resources. The preserve is situated in
a unique setting in the Eastern Cross Timbers along the banks of an unnamed intermittent
tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River that was possibly spring fed. The preserve
is underlain by the Woodbine formation on an upland slope above the floodplain of the
West Fork and possibly. The topography of the preserve is undulating with high knolls,
finger ridges and large exposures of sandstone surrounding the tributary. Given its
distance from the West Fork, and that this type of preserved environmental setting had
never been studied in the area, prehistoric site potential was unknown.
The research design stated that study area could possibly contain ephemeral remains of
temporary hunting or camping sites. It could have also been a location for gathering
acorns, as numerous recorded prehistoric sites nearby demonstrate that the area was
inhabited. However, if the area was used for hunting or gathering activities, no evidence
remains. No evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation was found anywhere on the
surface in the study area or buried in the thin slope sediments. The lack of buried
prehistoric site deposits is attributed to the upland slope location and the absence of
habitable locations.
Historic sites were considered low potential and for historic occupation given that, the
topography provides no suitable occupation site. The research design stated that the only
feasibly expected evidence of historic occupation would have been trash or artifact
scatters near the drainage, however none were located. Since this was a unique
environmental setting, any other locations similar to Crystal Canyon located in North
Central Texas, should be surveyed to assess the potential and compared with Crystal
Canyon to see if any evidence of prehistoric utilization ever existed in this type of setting.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the survey and absence of cultural materials within the
study area, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted and that the City of Arlington be allowed to construct the foot trail and
parking lot. If cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until discussions with the
proper agency have been concluded.
