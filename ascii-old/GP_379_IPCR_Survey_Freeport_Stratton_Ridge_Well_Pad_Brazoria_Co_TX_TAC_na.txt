ABSTRACT

Natural Resource Group, Inc., on behalf of Freeport LNG Development L.P.
(Freeport LNG), contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) of
Houston, Texas, to perform an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of 20.23
hectares (50 acres) in Brazoria County, Texas. Freeport LNG proposes to construct a
well pad at Stratton Ridge north of the city of Freeport. The proposed well pad will
measure 91.44 meters (300 feet) wide and 152.40 meters (500 feet) long. The total area
that the well pad will cover is approximately 1.39 hectares (3.44 acres). Associated
construction efforts will involve clearing vegetation, constructing a work pad, and
drilling a storage well. Aboveground facilities will include a well-head, water well,
diesel pump and tank, as well as auxiliary instrumentation and lighting construction.
This project is being conducted as part of a modification to Freeport LNG’s “Phase II
Project”, which is a compliment to the “Phase I Project”.
This report presents the results of HRA Gray & Pape’s investigations. An
intensive pedestrian survey was conducted and involved visual inspection of the ground
surface, shovel testing, and limited deep testing using a bucket auger. A total of 89
shovel tests were excavated along 21 north-south oriented transects spaced 30 meters
(100 feet) apart. Additional excavation on April 10, 2007 included three supplemental
shovel tests within the proposed well pad location. The subsurface testing was focused in
the southern half of the project area. This portion of the 20.23-hectare (50-acre) tract is
located in close proximity to Oyster Creek and contains soils that are considered to have
a moderate to high geoarchaeological potential. Of the 89 excavated shovel tests, six
were selected for deeper excavation below the reach of a standard shovel using a bucket
auger. This was conducted to evaluate the need for mechanical trenching. Based on the
results of these deeply excavated areas and the shallow depth of prehistoric cultural
deposits at nearby previously recorded sites, it was determined that mechanical deep
testing was not necessary.
During the intensive pedestrian survey, no new archaeological resources were
identified within the project area. One aboveground structural feature was recorded in
the northeastern section of the project area. The concrete feature likely represents the
remains of a farm-related water tank. The water tank (Structural Feature 1) appears to be
modern in age, and likely dates to the mid-twentieth century. No historic artifacts were
recorded in the vicinity of the feature. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work
at the water tank or within the remainder of the project area.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Natural Resource Group, Inc., on behalf of Freeport LNG Development L.P.
(Freeport LNG), contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas, to perform
an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of 20.23 hectares (50 acres) in Brazoria
County, Texas. Freeport LNG proposes to construct a well pad at Stratton Ridge north of
the city of Freeport. The proposed well pad will measure 91.44 meters (300 feet) wide
and 152.40 meters (500 feet) long. The total area that the well pad will cover is
approximately 1.39 hectares (3.44 acres). Associated construction efforts will involve
clearing vegetation, constructing a work pad, and drilling a storage well. Aboveground
facilities will include a well-head, water well, diesel pump and tank, as well as auxiliary
instrumentation and lighting construction. This project is being conducted as part of a
modification to Freeport LNG’s “Phase II Project”, which is a compliment to the “Phase I
Project”.
Although the Phase I and Phase II Projects were regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC), this modification to the Phase II Project is considered
non-jurisdictional under the FERC regulations. The lead federal agency for this project is
the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District. The
Jurisdictional Determination Application File Number for this project is D-14597/(04).
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if construction of the
well pad would affect any previously unidentified cultural resources located within the
project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). Fieldwork was conducted from between March
7 and March 9, 2007, and supplemental fieldwork conducted on April 10, 2007. These
efforts required 80 person hours. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed
with reference to State and Federal guidelines. The cultural resources survey was
conducted on privately owned property and did not require a Texas Antiquities Permit.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area is located in Brazoria County on the Oyster Creek (1995) United
States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map. It is situated
between Freeport and Clute, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed well pad is located in the
northwestern section within the 20.23-hectare surveyed area. The proposed well pad will
measure approximately 91.44 meters (300 feet) east to west by 152.40 meters (500 feet)
north to south. Therefore, the APE for this project is defined as 1.39 hectares (3.44 acres)
within the surveyed 20.23-hectare (50-acre) tract.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The following section provides a discussion of general geomorphological
characteristics found in Brazoria County. This is followed by discussions of soil
morphology, and climate typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low,
level to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal
Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the
Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the
Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Brazoria County, resulted from
depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from
glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and
variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, Brazoria County
is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging
in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott
2001; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human
occupation near the current project areas include the Beaumont Formation, generally
believed to predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called “Deweyville”
terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These
terraces date to between 100,000 to 400,000 years ago, and are characterized as
consisting “of up to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence
of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action
and discharge markedly greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these
deposits may be relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits laid down in the Brazoria
County area by alluvial or eolian factors or potentially, marshy environments.

SOILS
Four soil associations have been identified in Brazoria County in the Stratton
Ridge project area. Edna fine sandy loam (0-1% slopes) makes up the approximately 80
percent of the 20.23-hectare (50-acre) tract. This soil consists of a surface layer of
slightly acidic, dark gray fine sandy loam to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches). This is
underlain by clay subsoil that is categorized as neutral, very dark to gray in the upper
portion of the layer to a moderately alkaline, light brownish gray in the bottom portion of
the layer to a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches) (Crenwelge et al. 1981). According to
5
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

Abbott (2001:21), Edna soils have a low geoarcheological potential for containing buried
resources.
Pledger clay makes up approximately ten percent of the project area. It consists
of a surface layer of mildly alkaline black clay to a depth of 66 centimeters (26 inches).
Below this, a moderately alkaline, calcareous, reddish brown silty clay extends to a depth
of 127 centimeters (50 inches). This is underlain by a layer of alkaline, calcareous,
reddish brown clay to a depth of 162 centimeters (64 inches) (Crenwelge et al. 1981).
According to Abbott (2001:21), Pledger clay has a moderate to high geoarcheological
potential for containing buried resources.
Asa silt loam comprises approximately nine percent of the project area. Asa silt
loam consists of very dark grayish brown silt loam extending to a depth of approximately
30 centimeters (12 inches). This is underlain by a moderately alkaline light brown loam
subsoil to a depth of 94 centimeters (37 inches). Below this, to a depth of approximately
130 centimeters (51 inches), is a moderately alkaline, calcareous, reddish yellow silty
clay loam. The underlying soil unit consists of a moderately alkaline, calcareous, reddish
brown very fine sandy loam to a depth of 155 centimeters (61 inches) (Crenwelge et al.
1981). According to Abbott (2001:21), Asa soils have a high geoarcheological potential
for containing buried resources.
The Edna-Aris complex makes up one percent of the project area. These soils are
generally associated with pimple mounds, averaging 0.46- meters (1.5 feet) high and 6.10
meters (20 feet) in diameter. Slopes average about 0.3 percent. The complex is made up
of about sixty percent Edna soils, twenty five percent Aris soils, and fifteen percent
Bernard and Leton soils. The Edna soils can be found between the pimple mounds,
which are composed of the Aris soils. The Edna soils have a friable, medium acid, dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam about 20.92 centimeters (8 inches) thick. The subsoil
reaches to a depth of 156.90 centimeters (60 inches) and is composed of dark gray clay
that is slightly acid in the upper portion and neutral in the lower part. The Aris soils
found on the pimple mounds, have a surface layer of neutral dark grayish brown fine
sandy loam about 20.92 centimeters (8 inches) thick. This is followed by a layer of
neutral gray loam to a depth of about 60.15 centimeters (23 inches). The subsoil is
composed of neutral gray clay loam mixed with gray loam to a depth of 86.30
centimeters (33 inches). Between 86.30 and 156.90 centimeters (33 and 60 inches) is
mildly alkaline light brownish gray clay with dark yellowish brown mottles (Crenwelge
et al. 1981). According to Abbott (2001:22-23), the Edna and Aris soils have a low
geoarcheological potential for containing buried resources.

CLIMATE
Because the project area is located in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity characterizes the region as tropical. Winds
trend from the southeast or east, except in winter months when high-pressure systems can
bring in polar air from the north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well
6
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

into the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit), and are often accompanied by equally high humidity.
Although winter temperatures can reach into the low 30s (degrees Fahrenheit), below
freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of every year, and are
typically restricted to the early morning hours.
The climatic history of the Texas coast is not well known. Although pollen
records have not produced useful information, some studies have been able to make
assumptions about the paleoenvironment. Aten (1983) presents information for a high
stream discharge around 10,030 B.P. He then suggests that precipitation was reduced
between 8,490 B.P. and 5,060 B.P. (Aten 1983). These conclusions match ones by
Bryant and Shafer (1977) for central Texas and conclusions by Delacourt and Delacourt
(1978) for the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. Aten (1983) suggests that modern conditions
could be found along the Texas Coast after 5,060 B.P.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area is located on the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic
province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods sub-region of the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration activities, especially
those associated with rice farming, have resulted in the removal of native plant species
from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various elms, cedar, oaks,
sweetgum, and mulberry, although the Chinese tallow has become the dominant species
in many areas. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are
indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001). Mammals in the area include deer, squirrels,
raccoons, opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers. Riparian species include freshwater
mussels and snails, alligators, and many different species of fish, turtles, and snakes.
Bison and antelope occasionally enter the upland prairies near the coast, and these
mammals may have been exploited in the past.

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING

Between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake, most prehistoric sites near the coast
consist of shell middens found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten
1983; Patterson 1985). Inland sites are more similar to generalized open campsites. In
both areas, sites are found near stream channels. Historic sites tend to reflect farm or
homesteads, generally dating to the mid-nineteenth century.

THE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by Aten (1983) and
Story (1990). This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a
complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast. Along the Upper Texas Coast, the
Paleoindian period begins around 12,000 B.P. and ends near 9,000 B.P. (Aten 1983;
Story 1990). The population during this stage was highly mobile in response to the
movement of food sources. Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Plainview, and Golondrina point types (Aten 1983).
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500
B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). The Archaic stage is thought to include a shift towards a
diet more geared towards plant processing, but still included hunting (Story 1990).
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic period
in this region has not been well documented. Points from this period include Bell,
Carrollton, Trinity, Wells, and Early Stemmed.
The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) is represented by the earliest
surviving shell middens (Aten 1983) in the area. These middens contain remains of
shellfish, such as oysters and estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic
vertebrates, and the earliest known human burials in the region (Aten 1983).
Characteristic projectile points include Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for
population increase (Aten 1983). Projectile points differ from earlier periods. Points
associated with the Late Archaic are corner-notched or have expanding-stems, such as the
Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain types. The transition from Late Archaic stage to Late
Prehistoric is indicated by the introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983).
The cultural tradition during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast has been
designated as Woodland. Story (1990) has suggested the use of the term Mossy Grove
Tradition to define cultural patterns of the region. Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove
Tradition into five distinct time intervals on the coast, while noting that only two are
found inland.

THE HISTORIC PERIOD
Before European colonization of this region, it was occupied by the Karankawa
Indians. Five different subgroups of Karankawa Indians with the northern most tribe,
called the Cocos, lived in the area of modern day Brazoria County (Ricklis 1996).
In 1528, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca landed on San Luis Island and crossed the
Brazos River in the area that would become Brazoria County. Many other Spanish
explorers passed through the area, like Alonso De Leon in 1689 looking for the lost La
Salle expedition, and in 1727 Joaquin de Orobi y Basterra came through looking for
French intruders in the Trinity River area.
Stephen F. Austin and 89 of Austin’s Old Three Hundred settled the area in 1824.
Some of the earliest communities were Velasco, Brazoria, and Columbia. It was in
Velasco, soon after the Battle of San Jacinto, that General Santa Anna signed the Treaties
of Velasco with the Republic of Texas on May 14, 1836. Under this newly formed
provisional government came the formation of the first counties in Texas, among them
Brazoria County, taking its name from the Brazos River (Kleiner 2002). Between 1849
and 1859 that the county of Brazoria flourished. The county became the wealthiest in
Texas due in part to its largely Southern society based on plantation life and slavery.
Agriculture was the foundation for the county’s economy based primarily on sugar and
cotton (Kleiner 2002).
Prior to the Civil War, the majority of residents favored secession, which paved
the way for new industries to be organized to help the Confederate Army, such as the
Dance Brothers gun works manufacturing shop. After the Great Depression, rice
production helped strengthen Brazoria County’s economy. By 1940, the total acreage for
rice had risen from 6,000 acres to approximately 16,000 acres and became the nation’s
largest rice-producing area (Kleiner 2002).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), indicates that nine previously recorded archaeological
sites have been identified within 1.6-kilometers (one mile) of the project area. None of
these sites is located within the current project area. In fact, all of these sites are
approximately 800 meters (2,625 feet) south/southeast of the project area. A list of
previously identified cultural resources near the project area can be found in Table 1.
Only limited information is provided on the site forms for several of these sites.

There is very little information for Site 41BO73, 41BO74, and 41BO75. The only
available information indicates that Lawrence Aten recorded the sites, most likely in the
1970s.
Several previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within 1.6
kilometers (one mile) of the project area. In 1976, the Texas A&M University (TAMU)
Anthropological Laboratory conducted a reconnaissance survey along Oyster Creek as
10
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION—DO NOT RELEASE

part of the Freeport Hurricane Flood Project (Baxter and Ippolito 1976). As a result, the
survey identified four new prehistoric archaeological sites (41BO118, 41BO119,
41BO120, and 41BO121). Based on information available on the site forms, it is unclear
whether additional work was recommended at three of the sites. National Register
eligibility testing was recommended for Site 41BO120. Site 41BO118 was a prehistoric
shell midden located between five and 10 centimeters (2 and 4 inches) below the ground
surface (see Table 1).
In 1979, a linear survey was conducted on the northwest side of the Missouri
Pacific Railroad. This project involved the USACE, Galveston District. No additional
information was available for this survey. It is possible that this survey was conducted on
behalf of Dow Chemical Company for a proposed pipeline. The site forms for Site
41BO159 and 41BO160 appear to match the general description and location of this
survey. Both of these sites are described as prehistoric open campsites including thin
shallow layers of Rangia cuneata shell ranging between 23 and 30 centimeters (nine and
12 inches) below the ground surface. Neither site was recommended for National
Register eligibility testing (see Table 1).
In the spring and summer of 2004, SWCA (Lawrence et al. 2004) conducted
intensive reconnaissance surveys in support of Freeport LNG’s Phase I project. This
investigation examined 94.29 hectares (233 acres) associated with LNG tank facilities,
marine terminal facilities, and a 15.45-kilometer (9.6 mile) long send-out pipeline and
lesser facilities (Lawrence et a. 2004). The pipeline portion of the project is located
within 1.6 kilometers (one mile) of the proposed 20.23-hectare (50-acre) facility at
Stratton Ridge. No new or previously identified cultural resources were identified during
the survey of pipeline and no further archaeological investigations were recommended
(Lawrence et al. 2004).
Also, in 2004, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas, performed a cultural
resources survey within property associated with Freeport LNG’s proposed Phase II
Project (Pickering and Hughey 2005). A portion of that survey was conducted in
proximity to the current project area. The survey revealed no archaeological resources
and no further work was recommended.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

RESEARCH DESIGN
The survey strategy associated with the current undertaking was designed to
define all sites, prehistoric and historic, within the defined survey boundaries. In addition
to site identification, the survey was designed to provide sufficient data to determine
whether additional investigations would be required to fully evaluate the potential
eligibility of any newly defined site location for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as a state designated landmark. Therefore, an intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey was conducted across the entire 20.23-hectare (50acre) tract. This survey included visual inspection of the ground surface, shovel testing,
and limited deep testing using a bucket-auger.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND BACKGROUND RESEARCH METHODS
The background research and literature review was initiated prior to fieldwork
mobilization.
The background literature research included a review of both
archaeological site files and architectural resource files, and a review of previously
conducted cultural resource surveys in the vicinity. Site file data was gathered from the
Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC. Site file
research resulted in a listing of all recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers
(one mile) of the project area. Site file research was used to provide an historic context to
the survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to provide an
understanding of the development and history of the project area, the surrounding area,
and the Texas gulf coast. This research was used to prepare an overview history of the
area, and to provide an understanding of the contextual framework of Brazoria County
prehistory and history.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
The survey strategy developed for this project involved three key factors: 1) the
types of soils present within the project area and the geoarchaeological potential
associated; 2) an evaluation of the types and nature of nearby previously recorded
archaeological sites; and 3) the proximity of natural water resources, such as Oyster
Creek and Stubblefield Lake. Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface
reconnaissance and subsurface testing for nonlinear project areas between 11 and 100
acres in size call for one shovel test per acre. Work conducted during this investigation
surpassed these minimum requirements. The intensive pedestrian survey was performed
by excavating 89 shovel tests (Figure 2). Six of these were selected for deeper excavation

below the reach of a standard shovel using a bucket auger (Figure 2). This was
conducted to evaluate the need for mechanical deep testing. Shovel testing was
conducted along 21 transects (Transects A through U). Each transect was spaced 30
meters (100 feet) apart. All transects were oriented north to south. In general, the ground
surface along each transect was subjected to visual inspection. Shovel testing was
focused in the southern half of the project area closest to Oyster Creek and Stubblefield
Lake (see Figure 2). In order to fully inspect those areas determined to have the highest
potential to contain buried archaeological resources.
Shovel testing in the northern half of the project area was performed along each
transect in approximately 200-meter (656-foot) interval. Soils in the northern half of the
project area have been determined to have a low potential for containing buried resources
(Abbott 2001). As the survey progressed south, the shovel test interval was decreased to
30 meters (100 feet) due to the close proximity of Oyster Creek and presence of soils
with moderate to high geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001). When pimple mounds
were encountered, shovel tests were slightly offset to test these areas.
Six shovel tests were supplemented with the use of a bucket-auger. These were
excavated to a minimum depth of 45 centimeters (17.72 inches) below the ground surface
in dense clayey soils and to a maximum depth of 190 centimeters (74.80 inches) in
sandier soils.
Additional shovel testing was conducted on April 10, 2007 to supplement
investigations in the proposed 91.44-meter (300-foot) by 152.40-meter (500-foot) well
pad (APE) in the northwestern portion of the project area (see Figure 2). Three additional
shovel tests were excavated in the APE, bringing the total number of excavated shovel
tests within the APE to seven. All three of these new shovel tests (APE1, APE2, and
APE3) were negative. Previous shovel tests in the APE fell on transects G, H, I, and J.
Shovel tests G1, H1, I1, and J1 are now also labeled APE4, APE5, APE6, and APE7,
respectively. This supplemental investigation was conducted to more fully evaluate the
immediate area for buried archaeological resources.
All shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and were
excavated in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. Shovel tests were excavated to a
minimum depth of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) below the ground surface and a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters (3 feet). Removed soils were screened through 0.64centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed
standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soils color chart. The results of the shovel
test activities were recorded on shovel test forms. A log of all excavated shovel tests is
provided in Appendix A.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that construction of
the proposed Stratton Ridge well pad might have on resources within the 20.23-hectare
(50-acre) tract. Survey results indicate that no previously recorded archaeological sites or
significant historic structures are located within the project area. In addition, the survey
did not result in the identification of any new archaeological sites. Detailed results of the
investigation are discussed below.
The area lies within the Oyster Creek floodplain and is characterized by the
presence of a series of low-relief mounds that are composed of the Aris soils associated
with the Edna-Aris soil complex (Crenwelge et al 1981). During survey, a total 89
shovel tests were excavated (see Figure 2) within the 20.23-hectare (50-acre) tract.
Shovel tests in the northern section of the project area were typically excavated to a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches). Soils observed in this area were
typically composed of light gray (10YR7/1) sand followed by brown (10YR4/3) to very
pale brown (10YR6/3) sand. All shovel tests were negative for cultural material.
Shovel tests in the southern half of the project area were generally excavated to a
minimum depth of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in dense clay and to a maximum depth
of 80 centimeters in compact sandy clay (31.49 inches). Soils observed in the southern
section typically contained very dark gray (10YR3/1) to black (10YR2/1) dense sandy
clay or clay. One shovel test (Q4) excavated in the southeastern corner of the project
area contained a 15-centimeter (5.91-inch) thick layer of crushed shell and gravels. This
layer of materials was determined to be fill associated with the junction of two gravel and
shell covered roads located five meters (16.40 feet) east of Shovel Test Q4.
The use of a bucket auger to excavate to lower depths beyond what was capable
with a shovel provided information that was useful in determining whether mechanical
deep testing would be necessary. All six of the deeply excavated tests were negative for
cultural resources. In addition to this information, data collected from nearby previously
recorded sites (41BO118, 41BO159, and 41BO160) indicates that prehistoric cultural
materials were generally located between five and 30 centimeters (1.97 and 11.81 inches)
below the ground surface (see Table 1). The negative results of the six tests excavated
with a bucket-auger and the shallow nature of prehistoric deposits recorded in the vicinity
suggest that mechanical deep testing is not required.
During survey, one structural feature (Structural Feature 1) was recorded in the
northeast section of the project area (Figure 3; see Figure 2). It is a round concrete
feature that is open on the top. It stands approximately 0.91-meter (3 feet) high and is
four meters (13.12 feet) wide. It has a single metal pipe protruding from inside of the

northwest edge. This pipe appears to correspond with another pipe that protrudes three
meters (9.84 feet) from the northwest side of the concrete feature at ground level (see
Figure 3).
Several wood timbers measuring approximately five centimeters (3.94 inches)
wide and approximately three meters (9.84 feet) long are located on the ground surface in
close proximity to the round concrete tank. Also nearby are several metal pipes lying on
the ground surface. These pipes average three meters (9.84 feet) in length and are
approximately nine centimeters (3.54 inches) in diameter. Two pipes, one measuring 12
centimeters (4.72 inches) in diameter, and one measuring nine centimeters (3.54 inches)
in diameter were observed protruding from the ground surface south of the concrete
feature (see Figure 3).
A total of seven shovel tests were excavated around the perimeter of the structure
and associated timbers and pipes. Soils observed in the shovel tests were typically
composed of gray (10YR6/1) to grayish brown (10YR5/2) sandy clay loam followed by
strong brown (10YR4/3) and yellowish brown (10YR5/8) mottled sandy clay. No buried
cultural deposits were located in proximity the concrete feature.
It appears that the concrete structural feature may represent the remains of an
abandoned water tank based on the presence of the pipes. This feature appears to be no
older than 50 years in age, and likely dates to the mid twentieth century. An
archaeological site trinomial was not sought for this feature.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Field investigation of the 20.23-hectare (50-acre) tract at Stratton Ridge consisted
of a combination of surface inspection, walkover, shovel testing, and limited deep testing
using a bucket-auger. Subsurface investigation within the project area included the
excavation of 89 shovel tests to a minimum depth of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in
dense clayey soils and to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39 inches) in sandy soils.
The soils noted within the majority of the proposed project area were consistent with the
documented soils (Crenwelge et al. 1981). All shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials.
In the southern section of the project area, the Pledger clay and Asa silt loam soils
are characterized by Abbott (2001) as having moderate to high geoarchaeological
potential. Shovel testing was more aggressive in this area based on the higher potential
for the southern portion of the tract to contain buried resources. A total of 40 shovel tests
were excavated in this area at a 30-meter (100-foot) interval and a bucket auger was used
in two locations to sample the soils for deeply buried deposits. Based on the results of
these deeply tested areas and the shallow depth of prehistoric cultural deposits at nearby
previously recorded sites (41BO121, 41BO159 and 41BO160), it was determined that
mechanical deep testing was not required.
Based on the recent age of Structural Feature 1 recorded in the northeast section
of the project area and the lack of buried deposits associated with the feature, it is
unlikely that it is eligible for the National Register. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no
further work at Structural Feature 1.
No cultural resources were located within the 1.39-hectare (3.44-acre) APE.
HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work within the surveyed 20.23-hectare (50acre) tract in the proposed Stratton Ridge project area.
