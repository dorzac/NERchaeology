ABSTRACT

On 12 April 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Goodrich Petroleum Corporation’s (GPC) proposed
Lowery No. 1 well pad expansion project located in southern Nacogdoches County, Texas
(Project Area). The Project Area consists of an approximately 1.8-acre expansion of an existing
well pad, the construction of a 0.2-acre tank battery site, and the construction of a short access
road to connect the tank battery site to the well pad expansion. Overall, the Project Area totals
approximately 2.0 acres. Although the Project Area consists entirely of privately owned land
and its development will be privately funded, the project may require the usage of a Nationwide
Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers. As a NWP is a federal permit, the
project is also subject to the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of Castilaw Environmental Services, LLC (CES),
Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of GPC in compliance with Section
106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the boundaries of the Project Area and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have adverse impacts on sites eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the
documentation of 1 new archeological site. Site 41NA354 was documented as a relatively
shallow multi-component site consisting of comingled prehistoric lithic debitage and historic
debris. Based on the relative sparseness of cultural materials on this site, coupled with the lack
of intact, stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that this site is ineligible for inclusion on the
NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted. As such, it is Horizon’s further opinion
that the construction of the proposed Lowery No. 1 well pad expansion project will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that GPC be allowed to proceed with the wall pad expansion
project, relative to Section 106 of the NHPA jurisdiction. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the expanded well pad within
areas under the purview of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and USACE
should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Goodrich
Petroleum Corporation’s (GPC) proposed Lowery No. 1 well pad expansion project located in
southern Nacogdoches County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 and 2). The Project Area
consists of an approximately 1.8-acre expansion of an existing well pad, the construction of a
0.2-acre tank battery site, and the construction of a short access road to connect the tank
battery site to the well pad expansion. Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 2.0 acres.
Although the Project Area consists entirely of privately owned land and its development will be
privately funded, the project may require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the
US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As a NWP is a federal permit, the project is also
subject to the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of Castilaw Environmental Services, LLC (CES), Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of GPC in compliance with Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the boundaries of the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if
the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator.
Michael Mudd (Horizon staff archeologist) supervised the field investigations conducted by him
and Jared Wiersema.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 12 April 2011. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the boundaries of the
Project Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for Project Areas between 1.0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
such, a minimum of 6 shovel tests were required within the Project Area in order to conform to
these minimum standards. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a
total of 14 shovel tests over the Project Area.

The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the
documentation of 1 new archeological site. Site 41NA354 was documented as a relatively
shallow multi-component site consisting of comingled prehistoric lithic debitage and historic
materials. Due to the relative sparseness of cultural materials on this site, as well as the lack of
intact, stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that this site is ineligible for inclusion on the
NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted.
Based on the assessment that site 41NA354 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Lowery No. 1 well pad
expansion project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that GPC be allowed to proceed
with the wall pad expansion project, relative to Section 106 of the NHPA jurisdiction. However,
in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of an expansion of GPC’s existing Lowery No. 1 well pad in
southern Nacogdoches County, Texas, in order to provide ample space for additional equipment
necessary to drill into the Haynesville Shale formation (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on
the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Etoile South, Texas, topographic quadrangle map
(see Figure 1). The Project Area consists of: 1) extending the existing southeast pad line by
approximately 85.0 feet and the southwest pad line by approximately 110.0 feet (1.8 acres); 2)
the construction of an off-pad tank battery site measuring 90.0 feet by 115.0 feet (0.2 acres) in
size; and 3) the construction of a 15.0 feet by 90.0 feet (0.03 acres) access road to connect the
well pad to the new tank battery site. Overall, the Project Area totals approximately 2.0 acres.
The existing well pad and proposed pad expansion are located within the flowage easement of
Sam Rayburn Reservoir. Storage tanks for petroleum or hazardous products are not allowed to
be constructed within flowage easement. As a result, the tank battery will be located on a
separate landform situated outside of/above the flowage easement. Representative images of
the Project Area are presented in Figures 3 to 5.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in southern Nacogdoches County in northeastern Texas. It
is situated on a peninsula bounded to the west, south, and east by Sam Rayburn Reservoir.
Located above the conservation pool of the reservoir but within its flowage easement, the
Project Area is situated in an area of slightly undulating knolls and swales that appear to
experience occasional flooding based on the presence of numerous intertwined drainage
channels visible on the topographic map and aerial photographs containing the Project Area
(see Figures 1 and 2). The proposed well pad expansion straddles 2 nearby knolls that are
separated by a swale, while the proposed tank battery is situated on a small knoll above an arm
of Sam Rayburn Reservoir created on Duranzo Creek. Elevations across the Project Area
range between approximately 170.0 feet (51.8 meters [m]) and 180.0 feet (54.9 m) above mean
sea level.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Angelina River basin. The Project
Area drains to the south and southeast into an arm of Sam Rayburn Reservoir created on
Duranzo Creek. Duranzo Creek flows to the southwest and historically joined the Angelina
River approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers [km]) southwest of the Project Area.

CLIMATE

The environment in Northeast Texas has not remained the same throughout the ca.
12,000 years during which humans have lived in the region. Archeological, faunal, geological,
and pollen evidence suggests that significant changes have occurred, and these changes have
major implications for the development and maintenance of human adaptive strategies in the
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). At present, these changes are poorly understood as only
limited evidence of past environments prior to ca. 3,000 years ago has been obtained (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Collins and Bousman 1990; Story 1990).
Evidence for climatic change from the late Pleistocene to the present is most often
obtained through studies of pollen sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Few pollen studies
have been conducted in Northeast Texas—to date, only a few studies from Buck Creek Marsh
and Jewett Mine have provided interpretable pollen data from this portion of the state (Jacobs
1991; Scott-Cummings 1991), but these are poorly dated or have serious gaps in their records.
Nevertheless, an important series of pollen sites occur in areas surrounding Northeast Texas
(cf. Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The best dated and most informative pollen sequences come
from Boriack Bog in Lee County and Weakly Bog in Leon County (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway
and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). The radiocarbon dates from Boriack Bog suggest a
regular accumulation of deposits and indicate that Boriack Bog surface sediments are
approximately 3,000 years old. Bryant (1977) indicates that the bog was drained and the
surface peat was excavated in the 20th century; thus, the surface of the peat was lowered to

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

sediments of that age. Weakly Bog, by contrast, covers the last 3,000 years or so, and the
bottom samples roughly match the younger portion of Boriack Bog. Thus, Boriack and Weakly
bogs cumulatively provide a general picture of vegetation change throughout most of the late
Pleistocene and Holocene periods for this region of Texas.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for East Texas that
includes 3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.),
the Late Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. The limited available evidence suggests
that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods and
that, prior to ca. 10,000 years B.P., it was forested with species that prefer cool, temperate
conditions, including boreal taxa such as spruce (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This late
Pleistocene/early Holocene climate is inferred to have been cooler than today, with increased
precipitation and/or more effective moisture, but with perhaps less seasonal climatic constraints.
The Late Glacial Period was characterized by a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 2004)
during which the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak
savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial Period, the environment appears to have been more stable.
During the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.P.), warmer temperatures prevailed, with less
moisture and presumably a lower density of forest cover. The deciduous forests were replaced
by prairies and post oak savannas. Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that significant
expanses of grassland were present along the western edge of the Northeast Texas region.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. In the middle Holocene, the period between
ca. 7000 and 4000 B.P., much drier and warmer conditions may have characterized the region’s
climate, possibly resulting in even more widespread grasslands and replacement of forests
along its western edge. The forest cover in Northeast Texas is suspected to have been at its
lowest density during this time period (Collins and Bousman 1990:62).
Following the warm and dry interlude of the middle Holocene, environmental data
suggest that a gradual reforestation of the region continued into the late Holocene (ca.
4000 B.P. to present). Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that prairie areas were replaced
first by oak savanna, then by oak-hickory forest in the western part of the region and by oakhickory-pine forest in the eastern portions of the region. Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest
that essentially modern environmental conditions in Northeast Texas were probably achieved by
about 1,500 years ago.
Stable carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope analyses are becoming
increasingly important sources of information about past climatic conditions and changes. A
14,000-year stable isotopic record from the Aubrey Site in the Trinity River Basin in NorthCentral Texas documents changing climatic conditions with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler)
or more humid climates from ca. 11,000 to 7500 B.P., again between 4000 and 2000 B.P., and
yet again after 1,000 years ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Perttula 2004:371). Conversely,
8

110040 – Lowery No. 1 arch survey report

An Intensive Phase I Cultural Resources Survey of Goodrich Petroleum Corporation’s Proposed Lowery
No. 1 Well Pad Expansion Project, Nacogdoches County, Texas

the Aubrey Site record suggests periods of warmer-than-present climate between 7,500 and
4,000 years ago and between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Interestingly, fossil vertebrate,
pollen, and stable isotope data from Central Texas and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat
different story, highlighting 2 dry climatic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/2500 B.P. and after
1,000 years ago (Toomey et al. 1993; Perttula 2004:371). The timing and nature of such
climatic changes have major implications regarding the relative position of the prairie-forest
border, the possible presence or absence of bison, and the natural resource potential of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna.
The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm,
humid weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The
climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is
modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm.
Winters are short and mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing
weather interspersed with cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or
cold temperatures are rare. Sudden temperature changes are not very common during
summer, but may occur frequently in winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by
cold waves or sudden, strong north winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average
winter temperatures range between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and average summer
temperatures range from 85 to 95°F. Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on
early winter mornings, but freezing temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free
season is 246 days (March 15 to November 16) (Bomar 1983).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and
May, and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about
45 inches. Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and spring, and light snows fall
occasionally in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but do occur in the vicinity of
the project area. Precipitation generally increases from north to south across the region and
decreases from east to west in a clinal pattern. The wettest counties in the area (Shelby,
Sabine, and San Augustine) receive more than 48 inches of annual precipitation, while the
driest counties (Fannin, Henderson, and Anderson) receive between 36 and 40 inches of
precipitation each year. Droughts are not uncommon, and periods of lower summer
precipitation are often accompanied by extended droughts caused by warm continental Pacific
air masses moving across the area from the west.
Dendrochronological analyses of tree rings suggest that numerous wet and dry spells
occurred during the last 1,000 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and
the worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again
in the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). Stahle et al. (1985) suggest that the worst
June drought to occur in the past 450 years occurred during the period between A.D. 1549 and
1577. More favorable conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially
between ca. A.D. 1390 and 1440, then in the late part of the 16th and early 17th centuries

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

(Perttula 2004:371). Such climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and
success of maize harvests during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods and neighboring
Post Oak Savanna (Perttula 2004:371). Similar fluctuations throughout the Holocene would
also have affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and
animals upon which non-agricultural human populations relied.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Northeast Texas Archeological Region is situated within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas. Its western boundary, which is approximated by a line running north from
western Harris County to western Red River County (Dice 1943), is the western boundary of the
main body of pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. In Texas,
Austroriparian vegetation consists of 2 vegetation regions, the long-leaf pine and pine-oak forest
regions. The Project Area is situated within cleared pastureland that likely consisted of a
forested upland environment within the mixed pine-hardwood forest section of the Pineywoods
vegetation region prior to the rural development of the area and the construction of Sam
Rayburn Reservoir. Currently, the vegetation within the Project Area is limited to short grasses
and a variety of forbs and weeds (see Figures 3 through 5).

3.0 CULTURE HISTORY

The project area is located within the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, a
subdivision of the THC’s Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The cultural
history of Northeast Texas can be subdivided into 9 broad temporal periods, although the
historic period has been differentiated into overlapping Historic Caddoan and Historic
EuroAmerican periods to distinguish between the highly divergent historical experiences of the
indigenous Native Americans and EuroAmerican settlers during the settlement of Texas
(Table 2).

3.1.1

PaleoIndian Period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.)

The initial human occupation of the New World can be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Lynch 1990; Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft
Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were present in Eastern North America as
early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990), while more recent discoveries at
Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human occupation in South America by
at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al. 1997). Most archeologists
presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation in North America during the
Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Northeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This period
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often

fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of small animals,
fish, and shellfish during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in Northeast Texas for
hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America; rather, a
broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced until the Late Prehistoric
period.
The distribution of PaleoIndian artifacts within the region suggests that these early
aboriginal occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Anderson 1996; Perttula 2004:373; Thurmond 1990) as well as in resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment to the north (Anderson 1996). Anderson (1996) hypothesizes
that the initial and most intensive PaleoIndian settlement of the Southeast (including Northeast
Texas) occurred in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.
From there, PaleoIndian groups spread throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 250-to-400-km (155-to-249-mi) intervals. The relatively sparse PaleoIndian
archeological record, combined with the dispersion of artifacts across many different landforms
and physiographic settings, seems to indicate that PaleoIndian groups were highly mobile,
generalized hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields
and Tomka 1993), as has been inferred for PaleoIndian populations on the Great Plains.
3.1.2

Archaic Period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.)

Throughout most of North America, the onset of the hypothesized Hypsithermal drying
trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.P.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). In many regions, this climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle—the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Northeast Texas, however, a generalized hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory prior to the advent of large-scale
agricultural systems during the Late Prehistoric.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture have been noted as well. Johnson
(1962) employs archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
to bring chronological order to the diverse Archaic archeological record in Northeast Texas.
Johnson’s (1962) temporal divisions are based on projectile point sequences and on the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic period. More recent refinements of the
projectile point sequence (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990) document straight and expanding-stem
forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic subperiods and contracting-stem darts
during the Late Archaic and subsequent Early Ceramic periods (Schambach 1982, 1998).

3.1.3

Early Ceramic Period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800)

The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), also known as the Woodland
period, is characterized in much of Northeast Texas, especially from the Sabine to the Red
rivers, primarily by plain, relatively thick ceramic bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted
axe heads, smaller and thinner versions of Gary dart points, and later in the period by cornernotched arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Early Ceramic sites along the Red River in
southwestern Arkansas and in Northeast Texas have abundant ceramics, though many sites of
this age, especially between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, do not evince such prevalent use of
ceramics (Perttula 2004:376). This situation suggests regional differences in food processing
technologies and/or dietary habits, and may further highlight differences in the degree of
sedentism among populations across the area (Skibo and Blinman 1999). Lower Mississippi
Valley ceramic styles (e.g., Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised,
Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some regularity at sites in the Sabine,
Sulphur, and Big Cypress basins (Story 1990). These ceramics may provide evidence of
contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South and Lower Mississippi Valley
populations, or they may represent the adoption of Lower Mississippi Valley stylistic and
decorative attributes by local potters (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
The Early Ceramic inhabitants of Northeast Texas were still primarily hunter-gatherers,
though they may have lived in increasingly large groups and/or resided for longer periods of
time at certain sites (Perttula 2004:377). Larger villages and multiple mound centers begin to
be constructed during this period on the major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers). Some
sites have relatively substantial midden deposits, particularly along the Red River and in the
upper Sulphur River basin (Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982), and some evidence for
structures (probably daubed pole and thatch structures), but the degree of settlement
permanence is still less than that seen in the subsequent, long-term, Caddoan settlements of
Northeast Texas (Perttula et al. 1993:99).
On the basis of available paleobotanical information, Early Ceramic groups may have
cultivated squash (McGregor 1996) and used native seeds, tubers, and roots in addition to a
variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources (Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Early Ceramic occupations suggests that some level of
horticultural activity was occurring, though intensive use of colonizing weedy annuals may
similarly account for the presence of these implements. Bruseth (1998) has suggested that
maize was being cultivated during the latter portions of this period, but stable isotope analyses
of some 25 or more Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Formative to Early Caddoan human
remains indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet at this time (Rose et al. 1998).
Early Ceramic period burial mounds have been documented in bluff top and alluvial valley
settings on the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach
1982, 1997; Webb 1984) and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Northeast Texas
(Story 1990). Mortuary ceremonialism included the interment of costly, non-local raw materials
and artifacts, including chert, copper, and Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic vessels, in the burial
mounds. Evidence of mortuary or ritual practices also occurs in non-mound contexts such as
the Hurricane Hill Site, which contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill, and the Mahaffey

15

Section 3.0: Culture History

Site on the Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, which had a large cemetery with flexed
and semiflexed burials without grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978). In the broadest sense,
the establishment of bounded cemeteries is often interpreted as a correlate of increasing
sedentism in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004:378).
3.1.4

Formative, Early, and Middle Caddoan Periods (ca. A.D. 800 to 1400)

The Caddoan archeological record represents the fluorescence of aboriginal complex
societies in northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and
southeastern Oklahoma, and generations of archeologists have long been captivated by the
beautifully manufactured ceramics and other material goods, the earthen mounds, the wellpreserved villages and hamlets, and the existence of a paleobotanical record (e.g., Perttula
2004; Swanton 1942). In the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, the timeframe referred to
in many surrounding regions as the Late Prehistoric period is usually subdivided into the
Formative Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1200), the
Middle Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400), and the Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) periods
(Perttula 1993a). European contact with Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas began around ca.
A.D. 1540, but it was sporadic until after ca. A.D. 1680 (Perttula 1992), and the Historic
Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1680 to 1860) therefore covers the period of regular interaction with
Spanish, French, and other EuroAmerican settlers up to the expulsion of the Caddo peoples
from their homelands and forced removal to Indian Territory in 1859. General characteristics of
Caddoan tradition are discussed below.
In general terms, the Caddo were characterized by:
…a large population represented by many small settlements scattered within particular
resource areas; a reliance upon horticulture as one of the primary means of subsistence;
differentiated and undifferentiated mound/habitation sites with structurally differentiated
mound classes (producing an apparently hierarchic division of places on the landscape);
differential treatment of the dead reflective of a system of ranking; [and] indications of
long-term cooperation in disposal of the dead by groups represented by some of the
archeological units (Prewitt 1974:76).

Broadly, these basic characteristics of settlement, subsistence, sociopolitical organization, and
mortuary practices are representative of the Caddoan archeological area from ca. A.D. 750 to
1750 and are similar, if not identical, to what constitutes the Mississippian period cultural
traditions of the Mississippi River Valley and Eastern Woodlands of North America (Griffin 1967,
1985; Smith 1990). Despite these similarities, Caddoan archeologists maintain that the
prehistoric and early historic Caddoan tradition developed largely independently of
Mississippian-period chiefdoms elsewhere (Smith 1990).
Formative to Middle Caddoan period groups seem to have been horticulturalists,
cultivating maize and squash along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth
1983). They also gathered nuts, tubers, and roots and were proficient hunters of deer, fish,
rabbits, raccoon, turkey, squirrel, and turtles. Available paleobotanical and bioarcheological
evidence from Northeast Texas and elsewhere within the Caddoan area, including stable
carbon isotope analyses of human remains (Rose et al. 1998), suggests that Caddoan groups
16

110040 - 01 lowery no. 1 expansion arch survey report

An Intensive Phase I Cultural Resources Survey of Goodrich Petroleum Corporation’s Proposed Lowery
No. 1 Well Pad Expansion Project, Nacogdoches County, Texas

became dependent primarily upon maize and other domesticated crops only after about
A.D. 1300. By ca. A.D. 1450, maize comprised more than 50% of the diet (Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998), though local variation in dependence upon cultivated plants
has been noted (Cliff 1997; Largent et al. 1997; Perttula 1999).
The most distinctive material culture item of the Caddo populations living in Northeast
Texas was the ceramics they made for cooking, storage, and serving needs (Perttula et al.
1995). The variety of styles and forms of ceramics recovered from the region hint at the range,
temporal span, and geographic extent of prehistoric Caddoan groups across the landscape
(Thurmond 1990). Story (1990:246-247, 277-319) suggests that the earliest ceramics in the
region date between ca. 500 and 100 B.C. and are closely related to the ceramics being
produced in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Between the introduction of ceramics in the region
and the emergence of distinctive Caddoan vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D. 800,
the local plainware traditions seem to have continued relatively unchanged.
Aside from ceramics, Formative to Middle Caddoan period populations in the
Pineywoods possessed a sophisticated technology based on the use of stone, bone, wood,
shell, and other media for the manufacture of tools, clothing, basketry, ornaments, and other
items (Perttula 1992:15). Well-made corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points
were common, along with siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools, such as unifacial flake scraping and cutting
implements (Perttula 2004:386). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes, as well as ceramic earspools and figurines, were also manufactured by the
Caddo at this time (Newell and Krieger 1949).
Locally available lithic materials were usually employed for the manufacture of stone
tools, but non-local raw materials and finished goods made from these raw materials were also
obtained through trade (Brown 1983; Perttula 1990). The development and maintenance of
long-distance east-to-west and north-to-south trade networks were notable features of
prehistoric Caddoan tradition. Trade items included bison hides and salt; raw materials such as
copper, stone, and marine shell; and finished objects such as pottery vessels and large
ceremonial bifaces (Brown 1983; Creel 1991; Early 1990; Vehik 1988, 1990). Many of the more
exotic trade items, especially marine shell and copper artifacts, were obtained from areas more
than 186 km (300 mi) away from the Caddoan area (Perttula 1992).
3.1.5

Late Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680)

As currently defined, the Late Caddoan period extends from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680
(Story 1990). Late Caddoan occupation in Northeast Texas was arguably centered on the
Great Bend area of the Red River, where Late Caddoan archeological sites are included in the
contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases (Schambach 1983). Texarkana phase sites
occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line, as well on
the lower Sulphur River (Jelks 1961), while Belcher phase sites are distributed from about
Fulton, Arkansas, to below Shreveport, Louisiana (Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; Webb 1959).
The McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex upstream from
the Texarkana phase (Bruseth 1998). Texarkana and Belcher phase sites include large,

HJN 110040 AR 01

17

Section 3.0: Culture History

permanent settlements with mounds, cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads (Perttula 2004:393).
The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds used as temples, burial
mounds, and/or ceremonial fire mounds, as during earlier Caddoan periods (Kelley 1998; Webb
1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural communities with
complex societies led by individuals with high status (Story 1990).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been
termed rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula 1991) because they were distributed along
secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted of functionally equivalent farmsteads
and hamlets. Small mound centers were being constructed by Titus phase and other Late
Caddoan groups up until ca. A.D. 1500, and possibly later, in Northeast Texas, but they lack
evidence of burial mounds or large platforms; rather, these mounds contain buried, burned
structures (Perttula 2004:398). The larger Caddoan towns were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These communities were
hierarchically arranged, with civic-ceremonial centers at the “top” surrounded by associated
towns of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures (such as bark- or
brush-covered shelters and storage platforms) (Schambach 1983:7-8), followed by hamlets,
farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales, such as salt-making sites
(Early 1993; Gregory 1980:356-357).
Faunal subsistence remains are known from a few sites in Northeast Texas dating to this
time period but have so far received relatively little attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond 1990).
Vertebrate species represented in trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit,
jackrabbit, squirrel, beaver, turtle, and fish, though deer and turkey appear to have been the
dominant economic species (Perttula et al. 1982; 1993). In general, subsistence evidence
suggests that Pineywoods Caddo practiced a strongly maize-based economy at this time (Fritz
1990:421, 425). Floral evidence from trash midden deposits suggests that maize (Zea mays)
provided a dietary staple, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source
(Perttula 2004:4005). Nuts and seeds were gathered but appear to have been of lesser
importance than during earlier time periods (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et
al. 1982).
By early historic times, the Caddoan nation comprised at least 25 separate groups,
bands, or tribes organized into loosely affiliated kin-based groups referred to by European
observers as the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches confederacies (Perttula 1992). The
Hasinai groups lived in the Angelina and Neches river valleys in East Texas, the Kadohadacho
groups on the Red River in the Great Bend area, and the Natchitoches groups on the Red River
in the vicinity of the French trading post of Natchitoches established in A.D. 1714.
3.1.6

Historic Caddoan Period (A.D. 1690 to 1860)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico (Weddle 1985). While no
documentary evidence exists for direct contact with Caddoan peoples during these initial forays,
Europeans were already conducting slave raiding and native resettlement projects along the
Texas coast by 1550 (Bolton 1912). From 1528 to 1534, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and
18

An Intensive Phase I Cultural Resources Survey of Goodrich Petroleum Corporation’s Proposed Lowery

other survivors of the Narváez Florida expedition crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked
along the Texas coast near Galveston Bay (Bandelier 1964). Swanton (1942:29) does not
believe that Cabeza de Vaca actually encountered any Caddoan people during his wanderings,
though his dealings in Native American trade goods between coastal and inland groups suggest
that he might have traveled in the region (Perttula 1992:19). While direct contact between
Cabeza de Vaca and Caddoan peoples cannot be established by historical documentation,
Perttula (1992) argues that diseases such as typhoid and measles carried by the Narváez party
could have been transmitted to Native American groups living elsewhere along the Texas Coast
and then inland to Caddoan groups through aboriginal trade and other contact. Thus, the
Narváez and Cabeza de Vaca exploration may have been an important benchmark for the
initiation of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the Spanish Borderlands West
(Hester 1989:199; Perttula 1992:19, 1993b), and may have introduced epidemic diseases that
resulted in substantial population declines prior to the inception of more regular contact later in
the 16th century.
In the early 1540s, the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luis de Moscoso following
death of de Soto along the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis, passed into
Caddoan area, spending several months among the Caddoan groups who lived between
Ouachita and Trinity rivers (Swanton 1939; Perttula 1992:19). The death of de Soto on
Mississippi River at the province of Guachoya in the spring of 1542:

the

…freed the survivors from continuing upon the original objectives of the expedition.
There was only one thought shared by all: to escape from the whole dreadful adventure.
Under the leadership of Luis de Moscoso, they officially decided it was hopeless to seek
the sea…in fact, the cavaliers were clearly reluctant to take to boats…and instead
determined to march west in the direction of New Spain (Brain 1985:xlv).

Within what is now recognized as the Caddoan archeological area, Moscoso described
the provinces of Naguatex, Nondacao, and Guasco, for example, as groups that had dense
populations in scattered settlements and abundant reserves of maize (Swanton 1939:258-280).
Perttula’s (1992) examination of Moscoso’s travels suggests that his route passed through
settlements of aboriginal Caddoan groups known archeologically as the Late Mid-Ouachita (or
Social Hill), Belcher, Texarkana, Titus, and Frankston phases. Different versions of Moscoso’s
route have been proposed by various researchers (e.g., Hudson 1986; Perttula 1992; Swanton
1939). The basic import of the de Soto-Moscoso expedition in 1542 is that these explorers
documented and described aspects of Caddoan settlement, subsistence strategies, aboriginal
routes of travel and trade, and social organization that are broadly consistent with inferences
that have been made based on the archeological record.
Between 1520 and 1685, various Europeans actually lived in the Caddoan area less
than 1.5 years in total, and it is virtually certain that most Caddoan peoples during this time
never saw a European (Perttula 1992:29). As a result, artifactual evidence of this phase of
European contact is minimal. As Krieger points out:
In any one site, something like twenty beads and two bits of iron may be all that can be
found to represent perhaps a century of contact; and this being true, there must be

HJN 110040 AR 01

19

Section 3.0: Culture History

scores of sites actually occupied during the same ‘historic period’ from which the
archaeologist cannot recover a single European object (in Davis 1961:120).

The second major phase of European contact in the Caddoan historic period began with
the renewed exploration of the Mississippi Valley following the establishment of the Illinois
colony by the French in the 1670s. The Mississippi River, initially explored by Marquette and
Joliet in 1673 to the mouth of the Arkansas River (Delangez 1946), was fully explored to its
mouth by La Salle. Three years later, another expedition directed by La Salle intended to
colonize the area and link the Gulf Coast with the growing French colonies of Illinois and
Canada. For unknown reasons, this expedition missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and
came ashore on the Texas Gulf Coast at Matagorda Bay (Cox 1922; Gilmore 1986). La Salle
made several trips from Fort St. Louis to explore the region and try to find the Mississippi River,
visiting the Hasinai (or Cenis, in the French transcription) in 1686 before turning back with
several horses purchased from the Hasinai. Another effort was made in 1687 by the survivors
of Fort St. Louis; however, La Salle was murdered by several of the men partway through this
trip, and the remaining party decided to stay on with the Hasinai.
The years between 1685 and 1714 were a time of continual French and Spanish
exploration of the Caddoan area. The threat of French settlement in an area the Spanish
considered to be officially under their hegemony spurred serious Spanish efforts to settle and
missionize the country east of New Mexico and the Rio Grande known to them as the “Kingdom
of the Tejas” (Bolton 1912; Perttula 1992:30). At the same time, the French were determined to
take advantage of the La Salle explorations to extend their claims in the region. Shortly
thereafter, English colonies were established along the South Atlantic Coast that wished to
extend trade routes west to Native American groups living on the Mississippi River and the
Texas Gulf Coast (Coker and Watson 1986; Crane 1929; Usner 1989). European political
relationship, trade and religious objectives, and the larger spheres of influence under the control
of the Spanish, French, and British in the developing world economy all played important parts
in the fate of the Caddo between ca. 1685 and 1800 (Braudel 1984:21-85, 387-429; Wallerstein
1974; Wolf 1982:129-231). Trade contacts, rumors of settlement, and exploration by one
government were responded to in kind by others as part of the unstable process of colonization.
The nature and character of sustained European contact has been comprehensively discussed
by many researchers (Bolton 1915, 1987; Cox 1909; Fieldhouse 1966; Galloway 1982; Gibson
1989; Giraud 1957, 1963, 1974a, 1974b; John 1975, 1985; Surrey 1916; Swagerty 1984; Usner
1987; Wade 1989), and only the broad outlines are presented below in the interest of
summarizing the varying European objectives as they impacted the Caddo.
From the 1790s, containment of the expanding US east of the Mississippi River
dominated Spain’s concerns in its Texas and Louisiana colonies, and the allegiance of the
various Indian nations of the Provincias Internas, such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Comanche,
was perceived by the Spanish government as a critical factor in controlling the frontier. The
1790s were a period of growth in the American fur trade, and another major growth period in the
industry occurred from 1800 to 1808 (Clayton 1967). Beaver was the primary fur resource in
the trade from 1790 to 1820. The Kadohadacho and Hasinai participated in the trade from the
outset, and their contributions to the fur trade were considered important parts of the Spanish

20

and Louisiana economies (Ewers 1969:47-48; Flores 1984; Peake 1954:17-18). Following the
purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the US moved rapidly to explore the boundaries
and character of its new territory, and the federal government emphasized the establishment of
commercial and political relationships with resident aboriginal groups, including Caddoan tribes.
The Freeman and Custis expedition of 1806 on the Red River followed specific guidelines
regarding interaction with the Indians. This expedition was ultimately abandoned due to
interference with the Spanish related to questions about the boundary between Spanish Texas
and the Louisiana Territory. The US initiated a border war with Spain that resulted in the 1806
Neutral Ground Agreement. Possession of the Red River, as well as the territorial allegiance of
the Kadohadacho, remained unresolved (Flores 1984:287).
As Spanish and American trading ventures evolved through the first 2 decades of the
19th century, the actual settlement of the Red River, its tributaries, and the neutral ground
between Louisiana and Texas began in earnest (Strickland 1937; Haggard 1945). By 1818,
nearly 3,000 settlers from the Midwest and upper South had squatted illegally in Caddo country
along the south side of the Red River from the Great Bend to the Kiamichi River (Lottinville
1980:170-172). Anglo-American settlements increased up to and beyond the time of the Texas
Revolution in 1836 (Strickland 1937:64-238). This settlement expansion was also accompanied
by an influx of aboriginal groups from east of the Mississippi River and from the Arkansas River,
including Choctaw, Cherokee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Shawnee, and Koasati groups
(Anderson 1990; Everett 1990; Ewers 1969; Kniffen et al. 1987; Williams 1964). These groups
exchanged hides, corn, pumpkins, and beans at the trading house in Nacogdoches (Swanton
1942:88) as well as with American government traders at the new agency house at the mouth of
the Sulphur River. As the frontier moved west, Caddoan Indians in Louisiana became more
isolated in the Anglo-American community and were under continual pressure from these
settlers and from the immigrant Indians (Swanton 1942:88; Williams 1964). In Texas,
settlement pressures did not impinge on Caddoan lands until after 1830 (Strickland 1937:318355), though Stephen F. Austin viewed the aboriginal populations of Texas as a hindrance to
the security of settlement (Barker 1925).
Following the death of the Caddo chief Dehahuit in 1833, American pressure in
Louisiana on the new Caddo chiefs led to the ceding of Caddo homelands within the limits of the
US on 1 July 1835 (Swanton 1942:89-92). The Caddo relinquished their lands for $80,000,
agreed to move at their own expense within 1 year of the treaty date, and moved to Texas just
prior to the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The term Caddo Nation came to be
associated with the Cherokee as well as with the Hasinai, Anadarko, and other related tribes of
East Texas, and the Indians became subject to the repressive measures of successive Republic
of Texas administrations (Neighbours 1973, 1975). By the early 1840s, the Caddo Nation was
composed of remnants of the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and other once-independent Caddoan
tribes, and it had been essentially pushed out of East Texas along with the other groups who
had signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Republic of Texas in 1843 (Strickland
1937:355; Swanton 1942:97). In 1846, the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Anadarko lived together
in a village of about 150 houses on the Brazos River near the present City of Waco, Texas;
shortly thereafter, they moved near the Clear Fork of the Brazos to maintain their distance from
Anglo-American frontier communities. From 1846 to 1854, the US government and the Texas

legislature founded the Texas Indian Reservation on the Brazos River (Neighbours 1957, 1973),
but this reservation lasted only until 1859 due to frictions among white settlers, Indian agents,
and the agglomeration of tribal members. Accordingly, in August 1859, the Caddo Nation, then
about 1,050 people in number, was removed to the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency in
western Oklahoma. Since that time, the history of the Caddo peoples is largely similar to the
overall history of the US.

As discussed above, the earliest Europeans to reach the area that would become
Nacogdoches County were probably in a Spanish expedition led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado,
who traversed East Texas in 1542. In 1716, Domingo Ramón led an expedition to the region
and found several villages of the Caddo Indians and a large village of the Bidais in what is now
Nacogdoches County. In the midst of these tribes, Ramón built several missions including
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches (named for the Nacogdoche Indians) on the
site of present Nacogdoches. For the protection of these missions, he established the presidio
of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Tejas (Long 2011). It wasn’t until the early 1800s that
Anglo settlers began arriving in the region to settle land grants around the growing community of
Nacogdoches. For a detailed history of Nacogdoches County, see Long 2011.
Relative to this report, the Project Area is located a short distance southwest of the small
town of Etoile, Texas. Etoile lies 20 miles south of Nacogdoches and 19 miles east of Lufkin in
southeastern Nacogdoches County. The Handbook of Texas Online article pertaining to Etoile,
Texas reads:
In 1876 the Reverend James Sims, a Baptist minister, built a church at
Macedonia Springs, and a town called Macedonia developed around the church. The
community was sparsely settled in 1876. Roads were few and in very poor shape.
Steamboats from Beaumont docked at Brown's Ferry on the Angelina River just outside
the community until 1881. The town received its mail by horseback from nearby Cherino.
By 1882 the community had grown a little, and that year residents applied for a post
office, which they received in 1886 by paying for weekly deliveries of mail from
Nacogdoches and by renaming the town. They chose the name Etoile, which means
"star" in French. In 1897 Etoile had the Fisher and Crown General Store. By 1915 the
town had a population of 300, telephone service, a post office, a gin, two general stores,
and other businesses. By 1925 the community's population had dropped to 100, where it
remained into the 1940s. The local rail line stopped serving the town in 1950, and the
population dropped to a low of fifty. Between the late 1950s and 1965 the Sam Rayburn
Dam and Reservoir was built in the area. During the 1980s Etoile comprised a population
of seventy, a few stores, and several bait houses, marinas, boat stalls, and
campgrounds. It was mainly a retirement community. Some residents raised beef cattle
and chickens. In the early 1990s Etoile reported a population of seventy, with seven
businesses and a post office. The population remained the same in 2000 (Folsom 2011).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 9 previously recorded
archeological sites within a 1.0-mile perimeter of the Project Area, while a review of the National
Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter
(THC 2011; NPS 2011). The previously recorded archeological sites and their distances from
the Project Area are summarized in Table 3, and their locations relative to the Project Area are
presented in Figure 7. No previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic
properties, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the
boundaries of the Project Area. According to the Atlas data, the Project Area is located within
an area that has been previously surveyed for cultural resources. However, the survey was
conducted in 1948 and may not be consistent with the current THC minimum survey standards.

General Project
Area Location

Figure 7. Previously recorded sites in the vicinity of the Project Area (THC 2011)
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial terraces
near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the Project Area’s location on elevated
landforms above Duranzo Creek, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there would normally
exist at least a moderate potential for prehistoric cultural deposits within the Project Area.
However, as noted above, the Project Area is located within an area that has been previously
assessed for cultural resources. If this 1948 survey was thorough, then the lack of documented
cultural resources within the Project Area was originally thought to indicate a decreased
potential for undocumented cultural resources.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or cultural deposits within the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on 12 April 2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts within the boundaries of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for Project Areas between 1.0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
such, a minimum of 6 shovel tests were required within the Project Area in order to conform to
these minimum standards. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a
total of 14 shovel tests over the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter) hardware mesh.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 8.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

SURVEY RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the
documentation of 1 new archeological site. Site 41NA354 was documented as a relatively
shallow multi-component site consisting of comingled prehistoric lithic debitage and historic
materials. It is described below.
6.1.1

Site 41NA354

General Description
Site 41NA354 was documented as a multi-component site evidenced primarily by
prehistoric lithic debitage mixed with sparse amounts of historic debris. The site is situated on
an elongated knoll that extends in a generally north/south direction above a small inlet of Sam
Rayburn Reservoir (Figures 9 through 12). Prior to the construction of the reservoir, this
landform was historically located approximately 0.3 miles (0.4 km) west of the channel of
Duranzo Creek. Currently, the site is situated just above the conservation pool of the reservoir,
within its flowage easement. While the knoll itself appears to be at an elevation above the
occasional flooding of the area by increased lake levels, the lower elevations surrounding the
knoll do appear to flood based on the topographic quadrangle (see Figures 1 and 9).
The knoll containing site 41NA354 is located within an area of cleared pastureland.
Short grasses and other small forbs cover the site’s surface, providing little ground surface
visibility. Historically, the area was likely covered with pine forests typical of the region.
Although no evidence of major disturbances to the site were visible at the time of the survey, the
historic clearing of the area likely impacted the relatively shallow soil deposits on the site,
resulting in the comingled prehistoric and historic materials on the site.
Originally, the project maps provided to Horizon included a much larger and less-defined
Project Area. As such, the currently defined boundaries of site 41NA354 presented in Figures 9
and 10 extend beyond the limits of the current Project Area. The site boundaries may in fact
extend slightly farther to the southwest along the remainder of the knoll. However, this area
was beyond the limits of the previously and currently defined Project Area and was not
assessed. Of the 14 shovel tests excavated during the investigations, 11 were placed on the
knoll containing the site. Eleven of these produced the recovered cultural materials.

Cultural Features
No evidence of prehistoric or historic cultural features was observed on the surface of
the site or within any of the shovel tests excavated over the site. This includes a lack of
observed fire-cracked rock or discolored soils that may have been indicative of aboriginal
cooking features.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials recovered from site 41NA354 consist of 27 pieces of prehistoric
lithic debitage and 8 specimens of historic debris recovered from 11 positive shovel tests
excavated over the site (Appendix A). The lithic debitage is composed primarily of silicified
wood specimens and consists of 9 silicified wood flakes, 9 silicified wood chips, 1 silicified wood
pot-lid spall, 5 chert flakes, and 3 chert chips. Select examples of the lithic materials are
presented in Figure 13. While it is difficult to determine the stage of reduction of the silicified
wood specimens due to an indiscernible cortex on the material, the chert flakes consist of 3
secondary specimens and 2 tertiary specimens. With the exception of the silicified wood pot-lid
spall, all recovered lithic specimens reflect later stage lithic reduction activities typical at
prehistoric campsites. The silicified wood pot-lid spall suggests a probable prehistoric campfire
on the site at some point during its usage, resulting in the recovered heat spall specimen. Aside
from the noted lithic debitage specimens, no other prehistoric artifacts such as ceramics, formal
flaked tools, or fire-cracked rock were recovered during the assessment of the site. Additionally,
no preserved floral or faunal materials or temporally diagnostic artifacts/materials were
recovered. As a result, the prehistoric component of the site cannot be assigned to a specific
temporal context beyond “prehistoric.”
The 8 specimens of historic debris recovered from site 41NA354 consist of 2 round nails,
1 small twisted bundle of copper wire, 1 metal button, and 4 glass fragments. A photograph of
the recovered specimens is presented in Figure 14. The glass fragments include 1 brown bottle
body fragment, 1 clear bottle body fragment, 1 clear bottle base fragment, and 1 blue screw-top
bottle neck fragment. No specimens of solarized glass were recovered, suggesting that all the
specimens post-date 1915. While the 4 recovered glass specimens are generally non-descript,
the blue screw-top neck fragment appears to be a fragment of a machine-made Philips Milk of
Magnesia or Vicks Vaporub bottle typical after 1940. However, all fragments are too diminutive
to assign a firm date.
Of the recovered metal specimens, the twisted bundle of copper wire that may be the
internal remnants of a copper electrical wire whose outer plastic casing has been removed. The
2 round nails appear to be general construction debris. They suggest a post-1900 date for the
historic materials on the site as round wire nails became popular after 1900 when the first coils
of steel round nails were produced (GSNC 2002). Finally, the metal button is a nondescript 2eye specimen that appears to be made of aluminum. While no exact date for the historic
utilization of the site can be determined, the recovered materials all suggest a 20th century
utilization, and possibly even a mid-20th century utilization based on the blue screw-top bottle
neck fragment. The sparseness of the historic materials on the site does not appear to reflect
an intensive historic occupation of the knoll, and no evidence of previous structures or other

occupational debris was noted. Rather, the types and scarcity of historic materials on the site
appear to better reflect an ephemeral dumping episode on the landform.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the excavated shovel tests, the horizontal extent of site 41NA354 measures
approximately 150.0 m (492.1 feet) north-south by approximately 50.0 m (164.0 feet) east-west.
The site boundaries may in fact extend slightly farther to the southwest along the remainder of
the knoll. However, this area was beyond the limits of the previously and currently defined
Project Area and was not assessed.
Based on the recovered depths of the cultural materials within the excavated shovel
tests, the vertical distribution of the cultural deposits of site 41NA354 range between 0 and 60.0
centimeters (cm) (0 and 23.6 inches) below surface, with the bulk of materials being recovered
between 10.0 and 30.0 cm (3.9 and 11.8 inches) below surface (see Appendix A). Both the
prehistoric and historic materials were found to be intermingled throughout the vertical profile of
the site’s deposits, suggesting that the deposits have been disturbed in the past and that
integrity of the deposits is generally lacking. Sterile subsurface clay was typically encountered
at a depth of 60.0 cm (23.6 inches) below surface across the site, indicating a lack of potential
for cultural deposits below this depth.
Summary
Site 41NA354 was documented as a multi-component site consisting of a relatively
sparse scatter of non-diagnostic prehistoric lithic debris and an even sparser scatter of historic
debris. The prehistoric materials appear to reflect lithic reduction activities that may be
representative of a small prehistoric encampment during an undefined period of prehistory,
while the historic materials appear to reflect an ephemeral 20th century dump rather than an
actual historic occupation on the knoll. The prehistoric component lacks temporally diagnostic
implements, preserved floral and faunal remains, and evidence of occupational features. The
historic component consists only of small amounts of debris lacking any association with historic
features or occupations. Moreover, both the prehistoric and historic materials were recovered
throughout the vertical extent of the site’s deposits, indicating an overall lack of integrity within
the deposits. Based on the lack of site integrity, the general sparseness of the deposits, the
lack of temporally diagnostic prehistoric materials, the lack of cultural features, and the lack of
preserved floral and faunal materials, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41NA354 is ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted within the currently
delineated boundaries of this site.

6.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that site 41NA354 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the proposed Lowery No. 1 well pad
expansion project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further
investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that GPC be allowed to proceed
with the wall pad expansion project, relative to Section 106 of the NHPA jurisdiction. However,

HJN 110040 AR 01

33

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
expanded well pad within areas under the purview of the USACE and the regulations of Section
106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately and the THC and USACE should be notified of the discovery.
