Management Summary
In August of 2014, Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. was contracted by Toll-GTIS Property Owner LLC
to perform National Register of Historic Places and State Antiquities Landmark eligibility testing of site
41FB339, documented in 2013 by RKEI staff, in Fort Bend County, Texas. Recent plans indicate that the
site may be impacted by planned improvements associated with the Sienna South Development.
Therefore, National Register of Historic Places eligibility test excavations were performed at the site.
The testing consisted of the excavation of 10 backhoe trenches and one 1-x-1 meter test unit within the
current site boundary.
The investigations revealed three brick features that appear to have been part of a sawmill. The mill’s
equipment was removed from the location once it was no longer in use, leaving only the brick supports.
It is likely the sawmill was in use between the late 1830s to the 1880s.
Although associated with a rich history related to the Arcola Plantation, site 41FB339 retains little
integrity. The equipment related to the sawmill had been removed and any superstructure that may have
covered the facility has either been reused or has deteriorated, leaving only the brick foundation. RKEI
recommends that the site is not eligible for listing to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
because it lacks integrity.
The project was not conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit since the property is under private
ownership and the proposed development is privately funded. Steve A. Tomka served as Principal
Investigator. Artifacts recovered during the investigations, as well as all project related material, are
temporarily curated at RKEI. The artifacts will be returned to the property owners at the completion of
the project.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Toll-GTIS Property Owner LLC (Sponsor), contracted with Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) to
perform National Register of Historic Places and State Antiquities Landmark eligibility testing of site
41FB339, recently documented by RKEI staff, in Fort Bend County, Texas (Figure 1-1). The site is
located near the southeastern corner of the Municipal Utility District #4 (MUD 4) property on the west
bank of Sawmill Lake. The technical report (Clark et al., 2014) submitted by RKEI to the Texas
Historical Commission documented and described the site and recommended that it be avoided since its
National Register eligibility has not been determined. This recommendation was based in part on the
expectation that the location was outside of the footprint of original improvement plans. The Texas
Historical Commission concurred with these recommendations. However, upon consultation, it became
clear that recent plans indicate that the site may be impacted by planned improvements associated with
the Sienna South Development. Therefore, Toll-GTIS Property Owner LLC agreed to conduct the
National Register/State Antiquities Landmark Eligibility testing of 41FB339 and contracted with RKEI
to carry out the necessary archaeological investigations.

THE AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located within the bounds of the former J.D. Waters Arcola Sugar
Plantation, established in the middle of the nineteenth century and later purchased by T.W. House, a
wealthy businessman from Houston. The project area has a long history of use as a cotton and sugar
plantation. The APE is situated on the banks of Sawmill Lake, between the Brazos River and Oyster
Creek in southeastern Fort Bend County (Figure 1-2).

The project area is in the Coastal Plains ecological region. This area is characterized by relative flat
topography. Drainage basins feed into the Brazos River, Oyster Creek or Cow Bayou. Numerous ancient
meander scars and ponds are present throughout the region and serve as sources of fresh water and
localized but highly diverse plant and animal communities.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey, there are six different soils mapped within the portion of the MUD 4
hitherto surveyed (Figure 1-3). The soil types are Norwood silty clay loam (Nd) found around the
Sawmill Lake area, and Brazoria clay, found on flat to nearly flat terrain, rarely flooded (Ma). Soils
within the APE are summarized below in Table 1-1.

Chapter 2 Previous Archaeological Investigations of the
APE and its Vicinity
A pedestrian reconnaissance survey of a large portion of the Sienna Plantation Development was
previously carried out by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. in 1984 on behalf of the Johnson Corporation
(Glander 1984). These investigations included the APE of the current project. A single prehistoric
surface scatter, lacking physical and cultural integrity, was recorded during the survey. The
reconnaissance also resulted in the identification of the home site of J.D. Waters, the Waters Cemetery,
the site of the Waters brickyard, two existing brick structures believed to be associated with the
Waters/House sugar mill, seven other historic-aged structures believed to be associated with the House
Plantation era, and the Scanlan family home and cannery. In addition, three former structures and four
features located on historic maps and mentioned in the literature were discussed in the report. These
include a possible church, three possible depots, an abandoned dump, two railroad grades, and a cemetery
located near the Scanlan mansion. The report recommended that all of the existing brick sugar mill
structures associated with the Waters/House plantation should be considered eligible for listing in the
NRHP (Glander 1984). These structures are located to the east and outside of the boundaries of the MUD
4, the APE of the current project.
In 2003, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) performed an intensive pedestrian survey and
mechanical trenching on approximately 19 acres of property proposed for a wastewater treatment plant in
Fort Bend County. This survey area is located to the east and outside of the current project, directly
across Oyster Creek. No additional information was available for this survey but it appears that no new
sites were recorded during the survey (Bonine 2005).
Between 2007 and 2008, HRA Gray & Pape carried out a number of archaeological investigations across
portions of the 3,100-acre Sienna Plantation tract (McKinney and Hughey 2008; Nash et al. 2009),
including a survey and mechanical subsurface testing on behalf of UST-PRU Sienna, LP., on the
proposed approximately 4.0-mile long Sienna Parkway South Extension crossing through the center and
along the southern edge of the current APE. At the time, the property was privately owned and the
project was privately funded. The APE was restricted to the proposed right-of-way (ROW) for the new
construction. Field investigation consisted of a combination of 100 percent pedestrian survey
accompanied by shovel testing, mechanical scraping, and backhoe trenching. Trenching between the
Arcola Community Cemetery (FB-C057) and the proposed ROW for Sienna Parkway was performed
specifically to search for cultural materials and features that would allow the delineation of the cemetery
6

boundaries and whether its limits extend into the proposed ROW (Nash et al. 2009). No evidence of the
Arcola-Community Cemetery was discovered within the ROW. HRA Gray & Pape recommended that no
further archaeological work be required within the proposed road ROW (Nash et al. 2009).
HRA Gray and Pape also performed extensive archeological and historic research on the CommunityArcola Cemetery. The cemetery is located to the east and outside of the current APE. The purpose of the
work was to determine the boundaries of the cemetery. Research and fieldwork resulted in identifying
seven headstones and 59 possible burial shafts. The dates of the seven headstones range between 1910
and 1926 and one burial was identified as that of a leased convict and two others were identified as
women. It was observed that the headstones and depressions tended to be found in clusters; however, an
informant stated that the cemetery extends, “well past the northern-most identified depression”. HRA
Gray and Pape recommended additional work such as: the collection of oral histories, archival research,
and mechanical scraping and trenching to define the eastern, western, and northern boundaries of the
cemetery (Nash et al. 2009).
In 2009, HRA Gray & Pape performed an historic assessment of a drainage feature located within the
Sienna Plantation Development. The canal that connects the Oyster Creek and Cow Bayou drainages is
believed to be of early Texas statehood age. However, available documentation did not support this
postulation, therefore the feature was not recommended for NRHP eligibility as an isolated feature
(McKinney 2008).
In the fall of 2009 and summer of 2010, HRA Gray & Pape excavated and documented the Sienna
Plantation Sugar House/T.W. House New Sugar House and mill that was accidentally discovered during
the construction of the Waters Lake Boulevard extension project, in Fort Bend County (Nash et al. 2009;
Nash n.d.). The site was considered not eligible as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) due to the fact
that the entire site was going to be removed for the completion of the Waters Lake Boulevard extension.
In 2013, Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) performed 70 shovel tests across the high-probability
areas within the 3,700-acre Proposed Sienna South Development and the delineation of the Community
Arcola Cemetery (FB-C057) on behalf of Toll-GTIS Property Owner LLC. At the time, the property was
privately owned and the project was privately funded. Only one shovel test, ST 70 located along Oyster
Creek), produced cultural materials consisting of two, historic-age machine-made nails found between 10
and 15 cmbs. The cemetery boundaries were further investigated based on earlier HRA Gray & Pape
recommendations. The northern and eastern boundaries were scrapped in search of potential unmarked
graves, which none were found. RKEI redefined the cemetery boundaries and recommended a 75 foot
7

buffer to further protect against accidental disturbance of an unmarked grave during future construction
activities.
In the spring of 2014, Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) performed mechanical trenching of the
1,134-acre Municipal Utility District #4 (MUD 4) on behalf of Toll-GTIS Property Owner LLC. Four of
the 44 backhoe trenches encountered were positive for cultural materials and all 4 were associated with
the newly discovered 41FB339. 41FB339 was mapped and RKEI recommended further work to establish
it’s potential eligibility for listing on the NRHP and formal designation as an SAL.

Chapter 3 Historical Background
The settlement of the region by Anglo colonists began during the 1820s. Prior to this date, the area had
been sporadically used by the Karankawa Indians. The Karankawa occupied the area of Texas west of
Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi, typically in small bands that moved frequently to follow supplies of
natural resources (Newcomb 1961). The Karankawa are often characterized as being an aggressive group
of people, but the colonists that settled the Fort Bend area had few problems. This is likely due to the
movement of the Karankawa groups out of the Fort Bend County area by the 1850s.
Moses Austin was given permission by the Spanish government to settle 300 families in the Brazos and
Colorado River valleys. The plans were delayed by his death in 1821. Mexico’s independence from
Spain also hindered the settlement. Moses’ son, Stephen F. Austin was able to take over the efforts and
arranged for a group of colonists to sail from New Orleans to the Brazos River. In 1822, a small
expedition of men established a cabin approximately ninety miles inland that became known as Fort
Bend. By 1824, the Mexican Government officially granted leagues of land to the colonists Austin
brought to Texas. Fifty-three grants were given to colonists within the Fort Bend area.
The location of site 41FB339 falls within a portion of land that had been granted to David Fitzgerald in
1824. Fitzgerald was awarded Patent No. 82 on July 10, 1824, consisting of 4428.4 acres. According to
the document on File (Tx GLO), the grant was located east of the Brazos, and then joined the Hall and
Barnett leagues. David Fitzgerald was one of the “Old Three Hundred” that was awarded grants from the
Austin’s first empresario. Fitzgerald retained the land until 1840.
David Fitzgerald was accompanied by his son, John, to Texas in 1822. David had a daughter that
remained in the states with her husband. In 1832, Fitzgerald’s son-in-law came to Texas to make contact
with the man who had not spoken to his relatives in the states for at least a decade. Upon arriving at the
Fitzgerald League, the son-in-law, Eli, found that his father-in-law had passed just a few weeks prior.
Eli’s brother-in-law, John, was living on the league at the time. Eli decided to bring his wife and children
to Texas and settled on the league as well (Wharton 1939). Fitzgerald and the Fenns remained on the
property for about 8 years.
In 1840, Jonathan D. Waters, also known as Colonel Waters, came to the Fort Bend area. Deed records
show that Waters purchased a large portion of the Fitzgerald property by October of 1844 (FBCDR B:92).
He purchased another portion from Sarah Fenn, David Fitzgerald’s daughter, in 1844 (FBCDR B:93).
Over the next decade, Waters purchased additional tracts of land (FBCDR) and had a thriving plantation
complete with sugar, cotton, and corn crops, a brick yard, a sugar mill, and a cotton gin that he called
9

Arcola Plantation (Johnson 2014). It was believed that he had the largest sugar and cotton plantation in
Fort Bend County (Wharton 1939). Waters had a large brick house constructed at the northern line of the
Fitzgerald League was, near what came to be the Sante Fe Railroad Bridge. Waters’ brother came to visit
the plantation in 1844, but never made it back to where he came in Alabama. Waters’ brother died
suddenly and was buried on the plantation grounds near a grove of pecan trees not very far from the main
house (Wharton 1939).
Waters appears to have been a bit of a loose cannon when dealing with others in the community. He had
a dispute over land with Collin Cox, a neighbor who had married Sarah Fenn, daughter of David
Fitzgerald. Cox, who was unruly as well, indicated that he would kill Waters if provoked. Waters went
to Cox’s home with a few friends and killed Cox in front of his wife (Wharton 1939). Although the
ordeal made the local newspapers in 1847, Waters was never punished for the murder (Wharton 1939;
Johnson 2014).
Tragedy struck in 1848, when Waters’ wife, Sarah, died. Sarah left her half of the plantation to her
husband. Waters appears to not have been known for kindness or gentle nature. Instead, he was known
for being a businessman who overworked his slaves and livestock (Wharton 1939; Johnson 2014).
Waters needed to travel to the county seat to probate Sarah’s will. He waited for a length of time, almost
ninety days, and not only filed the will with probate but also requested a marriage license to wed Clara
Byne. The two were married in March of 1848, barely three months after Sarah’s death (Wharton 1939).
Waters threw all of his efforts into creating a successful plantation throughout the 1850s. He often
worked all the daylight hours pushing his mules and slaves to produce more for the plantation. It was
reported that he had up to 500 slaves working the plantation during the 1850s and 1860s. Locals
discussed how he only fed the slaves “cornmeal mush cooked in huge boilers” (Wharton 1939:138). By
1860, Waters was considered the wealthiest man in Fort Bend County. The plantation’s entire acreage
had increased to 20,600, its cash value had risen to $270,000, and its farming implements and machinery
were valued at $18,000 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1860).
During the spring of 1860, Clara Byne died, leaving Waters a widower once more. Waters erected a
monument to Clara at the family cemetery where his first wife and brother were buried. He married again
shortly after Clara’s death to her sister, Martha McGowen. Waters had yet to have any children of his
own, so he adopted Martha’s children as his own.
The Civil War ended up costing Waters the fortune he had acquired. To help fund the war, Waters
donated $100,000 worth of gold to the Confederate cause. As a slave-owner himself, he felt that the
10

Confederate side of the war benefited him best. At the outcome of the war, both his finances and his
health were failing (Wharton 1939; Johnson 2014). Waters died during the summer of 1871 (Johnson
2014), although his wife, Martha, lived on for an additional fifty years (Wharton 1939). At the time of his
death, the Waters estate was believed to have a net worth of approximately $800,000.
The Waters heirs sold portions of the plantation after his death. The heirs sold a portion of the property to
Thomas Pierce. In 1872, Pierce conveyed the property to Thomas William House. House was a
successful businessman who arrived in Houston to start up House and Loveridge, a bakery and
confectionary (Beazley 2014). He later developed the business to sell dry goods, groceries, and accept
bank deposits. By 1853, House expanded further and opened the T. W. House and Company which
became the largest wholesaler in all of Texas (Beazley 2014). The 1872 acquisition of the sugar
plantation only worked to further House’s success. House employed John Fenn to run the plantation for
him, in hope to prove to the public that the investment was sound and could turn a profit. Within five
years, House and Fenn were able to increase the plantation’s size to span from the Brazos River to Oyster
Creek (Sowell 2014)
Convict labor became a popular source of getting work done on the plantations starting ca. 1871
(Wharton 1939). The source of cheap labor was one of the many tactics used to increase the profits.
House used convict labor to staff his plantation as early as 1875 (Glander 1984; Johnson 1961: 41-43).
House died in January of 1880 (Beazley 2014). His son, T.W. House, Jr. continued the running of the
plantation per the instructions of the will (Beazley 2014). House, Sr. wanted his estate to remain in one
piece for at least five years (Beazley 2014).
The sugar plantation was operated by House, Jr. throughout the rest of the nineteenth century. During the
spring of 1903, he incorporated the Arcola Sugar Mills Company. House, Jr. expanded the infrastructure
of the plantation to include a shop, commissary, dormitories, houses for the permanent employees, cane
field derricks, and storage facilities (Rice 1909:12-13, 19). Although House, Jr. worked on the expansion
of the sugar plantation, it appears that he was never able to consistently make a profit. The sugar industry
in the Houston area suffered once Hawaii was annexed to the U.S., Puerto Rico was granted protectorate
status, and the elements caused cane crops to decline (Clark et al. 2014). House, Jr. filed bankruptcy by
1907 leading the plantation to be put for sale in 1909 (Rice 1909; Clark et al 2014). In 1908, the
advertisement for the sale of the Arcola Sugar Plantation was presented in a pamphlet giving details
concerning the bankruptcy, offering details of what the plantation could produce, and photographs of the
main buildings. A topographic map of the plantation was included with the pamphlet that depicted the
crops being grown, the location of the different living areas and work areas, and location of drainages,
11

lakes, roads, and tracks.
The property was purchased by the Estate of T.H. Scanlan. Scanlan, a mayor of Houston, had passed
away in 1906 while visiting a vacation home in Chicago (Scanlan Foundation 2005). His daughters were
left his estate and managed it for the rest of their lives. The Scanlan sisters acquired the plantation in
1913 (Scanlan Foundation 2005) as a result of the House Bank failure. Scanlan had been a large
depositor in the bank, and once the bank went under all of the assets of the bank were distributed to the
depositors (Scanlan Foundation 2005). From the archival records, it appears that the Scanlan sisters had
little to do with the day-to-day running of the plantation and lived in Houston rather than at Arcola.
Sugar production at the plantation appears to have ceased ca. 1929 (Glander 1984). The use of convict
labor had been outlawed approximately 19 years earlier, causing great difficulty to the local sugar and
cotton plantations. The cost of labor dramatically increased when the cost of the product did not. Slowly
the plantations in the area declined, with the Arcola Sugar Plantation ceasing to function by the time the
Scanlan sisters decided to occupy the property. Due to tensions from street widening in Houston, the two
remaining Scanlan sisters decided to relocate to the Arcola Plantation (Scanlan Foundation 2005). The
ladies salvaged material from their Houston house to build a home on the plantation. The older sister,
Lillian, used the plantation grounds as a farm and ranch which she ran. Much of the area that had been
used for cane cultivation had been converted to pastureland for the ranch. Soon ranching became the
main activity at the plantation. What areas that did not see much livestock reverted to woodlands over the
years.
Lillian Scanlan died in 1947, at which time all of her assets were given to the Scanlan Foundation. The
Scanlan Foundation was formed at this time and consisted of Stella Scanlan (Lillian’s younger sister),
Louie Linnenberg, and Walter Brown. Linnenberg and Brown were individuals that had helped the
Scanlan sisters manage their property. Lillian stipulated that all of her estate was to be used for “Roman
Catholic religious, charitable and educational purposes within the state of Texas” (Scanlan Foundation
2005).
Stella Scanlan passed away three years later, leaving her estate to the Scanlan Foundation (Scanlan
Foundation 2005). There was some uproar over the will at the time of her death. Extended family argued
that Stella was coerced into leaving her estate to the Scanlan Foundation. After going to court, it was
ruled that her will was valid and the Scanlan Foundation was to manage the assets of the estate. The
house within the old Arcola Plantation that Lillian and Stella had built became a retreat center operated by
the Cenacle Sisters. The Cenacle Sisters renamed the Scanlan property “Sienna Plantation” after the
12

Sienna region in Italy. The Sienna Plantation remained in the possession of the Foundation until 1961, at
which time it was sold to the Fuqua Industries, Inc. out of Rosharon, Texas (Glander 1984).
A review of the historic maps of the project area offer insight to the use of the plantation. The 1890 map
depicts the location of Mill Lake and the locations of the sugar house and T.W. House residence, but do
not indicate a structure on in the vicinity of the lake (Figure 3-1). The 1909 map of the Arcola Plantation
does not show any structures within the vicinity of Sawmill Lake, but does reveal that the land adjacent to
the lake was used to for cane cultivation (Figure 3-2). Opposite the lake to the northeast, there is a
loading derrick depicted. No earlier maps of the plantation have been located that depict the location of
the structures. The two maps examined both show Sawmill Lake, but do not have the location of the
sawmill for which the lake is named after. It is possible that the sawmill was constructed and fell into
disuse by the time the map of 1890 was drawn.

Chapter 4 Methodology
Field Methods
The archaeological investigations consisted of the mechanical excavation of backhoe trenches within the
APE and the hand-excavation of a single 1-x-1 meter test unit.
The backhoe trenches excavated during the project were placed perpendicular to the lake bank. Each
trench was excavated to a maximum depth of 1.5 m below surface. Each trench was approximately 80 cm
wide and 2.5 to 3 meters long. To prevent damage to the brick features, the backhoe left 5 to 10 cm of soil
on the façades. This soil was removed by hand. During the trenching, the removed dirt was briefly
inspected for cultural material. Select portions of the trench walls were profiled and photographed to
document the different soil layers and define original ground surface upon which the site features were
constructed. The placement of the backhoe trenches was made at the discretion of the Project
Archaeologist and Principal Investigator with the intent of determining if significant cultural deposits
were present within the APE.
The test unit was excavated in arbitrary 10-cm increments. The unit was excavated to yield fine-grained
information related to the vertical distribution of cultural materials within the site. All matrix was
screened through ¼ inch hardware cloth and artifacts recovered from each level were bagged with the
appropriate provenience information and returned to the CAR laboratory for processing and analysis.
Due to the quantity encountered, rather than collecting all brick and mortar pieces, only a sample of
bricks and mortar was collected from each level. Level forms were completed for each excavation level.
Information related to the broad range of artifact types recovered, artifact quantities, and matrix types
were noted on the excavation forms.

Laboratory Methods
Artifacts were processed in the RKEI laboratory where they were washed, air dried, and stored in
archival-quality bags. Acid-free labels were placed in all artifact bags. Each label displayed provenience
information and a corresponding lot number written in pencil. Additionally, the materials are processed in
accordance with current Council of Texas Archaeologists guidelines. Artifacts will be returned to the
property owners at the completion of the project.
Field notes, field forms, photographs, and field drawings were placed into labeled archival folders and
converted into electronic material. Digital photographs were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with
15

archivally appropriate materials, and placed in archival-quality plastic sleeves. All field forms were
completed with pencil. Ink-jet produced maps and illustrations were placed in archival quality plastic
page protectors to prevent against accidental smearing due to moisture. A copy of the report and all digital
material were burned onto a CD and permanently curated with field notes and documents. All project
related documentation is housed at the RKEI Archaeological Laboratory.

Additional Considerations
In consultation with the THC, subsequent to proper analyses and quantification, artifacts possessing little
scientific value were discarded pursuant to Chapter 26.27(g)(2) of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Artifact
classes to be discarded specific to this project included redundant or poor condition building materials.
Prior to discard, the provenience information and weights of the building materials were recorded. A
representative sample of the building materials recovered at the site was retained.

Chapter 5 Results of the Field Investigation
RKEI archaeologists conducted the investigation at Site 41FB339 over the course of four days. The
investigation employed three different approaches. First, the brick feature that had been encountered
during a previous investigation was uncovered. Second, backhoe trenching was used to determine if
additional features were present at the site. And finally, a 1-x-1 m unit was excavated to obtain a more
detailed look at the cultural material and stratigraphy of the site.

Backhoe Trenching
A total of nine backhoe trenches were excavated (Figure 5-1). Backhoe Trenches 1 and 2 had been dug
during prior visits to the site, both were re-excavated. Backhoe Trench 1 was located along the southern
edge of the brick feature identified during the 2013 site visit. Backhoe Trench 2 was located along the
north face of the brick features. These trenches were re-excavated to expose the brick feature and
determine if the visible bricks on the surface were part of a separate feature. Backhoe Trenches 3, 4, 5, 9,
and 10 were excavated around the site to determine if additional deposits were present. Backhoe Trenches
6, 7 and8 were excavated to aid in delineating the brick platforms.

BHT 1
Backhoe Trench 1 had been excavated at least twice prior to the 2014 site visit. The trench was located
south of Feature 1 (Figure 5-1 and 5-2), which was identified during the prior visits. The trench was
approximately 1 meter deep, 80 cm wide, and approximately 10 meters long. It encountered previously
disturbed soils and no cultural material. The brick feature was approximately 7 meters in length,
extending to the edge of the bank of Sawmill Lake. Feature 1 was approximately 1.2 meters wide. The
bricks along the western edge of Feature 1 were white-washed.

Figure 5-2. BHT 1 located to the right of Feature 1, facing east.

BHT 2
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated along the northern face of Feature 1. This trench had also been
excavated during previous investigations. The purpose of BHT 2 was to expose the northern façade of
Feature 1 and to locate the possible feature that was noted during the 2013 investigation.
The trench was approximately 11 meters in length and 1.2 meters in width. The previously dug portion of
19

BHT 2 was excavated with ease. Once the trench was widened to locate the northern brick alignment, the
backhoe encountered soils that contained a jumble of brick, mortar, lime, and a silty reddish soil. Larger
pockets of lime and mortar were noted along the length of the trench’s northern profile (Figure 5-3).
Cultural material noted in the trench included cut nails, small metal fragments, and a few faunal remains.

Figure 5-3. North wall profile of BHT 2.
Hand-clearing of the trench’s north wall revealed intact brick. The bricks formed the bases of two eastwest aligned platforms. The platform located closest to Sawmill Lake was designated Feature 2. The
brick platform located to the west of Feature 2 was designated Feature 3 (Figure 5-1). The bricks exposed
in the northern wall of BHT 2 were white-washed.

20

BHT 3
Backhoe Trench 3 was placed approximately 5 meters to the south of BHT 1. The purpose of excavating
this trench was to determine if additional brick features or other historic deposits extended to the south.
The trench was approximately 1 meter in width, 3 meters in length and 1 meter deep. The upper 30 cm of
the trench consisted of a brown, silty loam that contained many grass roots. Below this stratum was a
yellowish red silty soil with a slight clay content that contained no inclusions. This layer was
approximately 60 cm thick. At the very base of the trench, approximately 10 cm of a dark brown clay
with carbonate streaking that appears to be due to degrading snail shell was encountered.
No cultural material was encountered within this trench. The soils appear to be intact and had not been
previously disturbed (Figure 5-4). Once below the silty loam, the soil was extremely compact and
difficult for the mini-excavator to get through. The clay encountered at the base of the unit was more
difficult to excavate. It appears that the yellowish red silt and the dark brown clay were sterile soil strata
in the area. The compacted soil may represent the original ground surface at the time of the construction
of the brick features.

Figure 5-4. South wall of BHT 3.
21

BHT 4
Backhoe Trench 4 was placed approximately 9.5 meters to the north of BHT 2. The trench was placed
south of a trench that was excavated during the 2013 visit. The trench was approximately 1 meter wide, 5
meters long, and 1.5 meters in depth. The soils encountered were very similar to those encountered in
BHT 3. The upper 20 cm was compact, but easily excavated with the mini-excavator. Below the silty
loam was compact yellowish red silt that contained no inclusions. This layer was extremely compact and
was difficult for the mini-excavator to get through. At the base of the trench, the min-excavator
encountered the dark brown clay with carbonate streaks (Figure 5-5). No cultural material was noted in
the trench.

Figure 5-5. North wall of BHT 4.

BHT 5
Backhoe Trench 5 was located approximately 10 meters to the west of BHT 4 (Figure 5-1). The trench
was approximately 1 meter in width, 5 meters in length, and 1.5 meters in depth. The soil strata were
identical to that of BHTs 3 and 4 (Figure 5-6). The upper 20 cm was brown silty loam. Below that was
22

compact, yellowish red silt with no inclusions. The bottom of the trench (approximately 120-130 cm
below surface) contained dark brown clay with snail shell fragments. The soil was compact and sterile.
No cultural material was encountered.

Figure 5-6. East wall of BHT 5. Note clay at base of trench.

BHT 6
Backhoe Trench 6 was placed perpendicular to BHT 2 to follow the edge of Feature 3 (Figure 5-1). BHT
2 was extended further to the west than when opened in 2013. Once the southwest corner of Feature 3
was located, BHT 3 was excavated parallel to the west façade (Figure 5-7). The trench was
approximately 1.5 meters in width, 7 meters in length, and 90 cm deep. The base of Feature 3 was
located approximately 41 cm below the surface. The bottom course of brick was stepped to allow for a
small footing. The foundation was five courses of brick deep, and placed on the sterile, compacted
yellowish red soil. The bricks were white-washed. During the excavation, many loose bricks and pockets
of mortar and lime were encountered close to the foundation. Along the southern portion of the trench, it
appears that there is a slump in the brick feature. Part of the footing appears to be missing and there is a
23

jumble of brick and mortar in place of the footers. This may be due to rodent burrowing, or natural
settling of the soils over the years. The west wall of Feature 3 appears to be approximately 2.1 meters in
length.

Figure 5-7. A portion of the east wall of BHT 6 showing Feature 3.
Cultural material noted during the clearing of the façade included cut nails and metal fragments. All
pieces were relatively small and unidentifiable.

BHT 7
Backhoe Trench 7 was located perpendicular to the northern edge of BHT 6 (Figure 5-1). The trench was
excavated to expose the north façade of Feature 3 (Figure 5-8). The trench was approximately 1.5 meters
in width, 4.5 meters in length, and varied between 65 and 75 cm in depth. The same strategy of leaving
soil on the brick façade to be cleared by hand was used again. At the eastern edge of the trench, it
appeared that another brick alignment was encountered that was perpendicular to BHT 6. Trenching to
the east stopped at that point and the focus reverted to clearing off the north façade of Feature 3. Similar
24

to what was encountered in BHT 6, the façade was five courses of bricks deep, with a footing projecting
approximately 6 cm. All the bricks have been white-washed. Pockets of jumbled bricks and mortar were
noted up against the wall during trenching and clearing.

Figure 5-8. The north wall of Feature 3.
Towards the eastern edge of the trench, the northeast corner of Feature 3 was uncovered. The space
between Feature 3 and Feature 2 appears to be filled with loose bricks, mortar fragments, lime, and soil
(Figure 5-9). Also, what appears to be the northwest corner of Feature 3 exhibits one course of bricks
with a jumble of bricks fragments and mortar below. This corner is in line with the corners located in
BHT 2 and follows the alignment of brick found in the bank of Sawmill Lake (Figure 5-10). The north
walls of each feature are not aligned, though. There is an approximately 30 cm difference in the wall
alignments. The corner is also near an area where the backhoe may have taken out a few bricks during
excavation. It appears that there is a layer of bricks from this corner extending to the east that is one
course thick, possibly used as a flooring (Figure 5-9).

northwest corner of Feature 2.

Figure 5-10. Overview of the brick features; note that the north walls of Feature 2 and Feature 3 are not
aligned.

BHT 8
Backhoe Trench 8 was located perpendicular to the eastern edge of BHT 7 (Figure 5-1). The trench was
excavated to investigate a potential alignment of bricks noted in BHT 7. The trench was approximately
1.5 meters wide, 3 meters in length, and approximately 80 cm in depth. During the excavation of this
trench, RKEI was better able to expose the north façade of the brick foundation, revealing corners that
indicated there were two brick features. In addition, a small stack of bricks was noted approximately 1.5
meters to the north of the Features 2 and 3. The stack was three bricks high, although they did not adjoin
any other surrounding bricks. Approximately 30 cm to the west, near the bottom brick in the stack, was a
metal bar that resembles a piece of track. The possible track piece was 60 cm in length, and
approximately 9 cm wide. There were no other bricks that could be tied to the small brick stack. There
were no other features noted within BHT 8. Artifacts encountered during trenching included animal bone
(possibly hog), cast iron fragment, a lead fragment, and the possible track fragment.

BHT 9
Backhoe Trench 9 was situated between BHT 4 and the northern end of BHT 8 (Figure 5-1). The trench
was placed in this location to determine if there were additional brick platforms or other buried cultural
27

deposits. The trench was approximately 3 meters in length, 1 meter in width, and 1.5 meters deep. The
soil stratigraphy noted in BHT 9 was very similar to the other BHTs that were not associated with the
brick features.
The upper 30 cm of soil was a brown, silty loam with grass roots. A few small brick and mortar
fragments were noted in the upper 20 cm of the layer. The fragments ranged in size from 5-10 cm in
diameter, and there were approximately 5 total. Below the silty loam, the soil changes to the yellowish
red compacted silt with some clay content. The soil stratum is sterile and contains no inclusions. This
stratum extended to approximately 120 cm below the surface. At the base of the trench (the remaining 30
cm), a dark brown clay was encountered that exhibited carbonate streaks that are likely related to the
presence of degraded snail shell. No cultural material was observed in this layer.
A column of soil was collected at every 5 cm increment between the surface and the base of the trench.
The soil samples may be used for magnetic soil susceptibility testing once returned to the laboratory.
Other than the few fragments of brick observed in the first 20 cm, no other cultural material was
encountered.

BHT 10
Backhoe Trench 10 was placed approximately 5 meters to the west of BHT 6 (Figure 5-1). The trench
was orientated north/south. It was excavated to determine if a channel had existed between the Feature 1
and Features 2 and 3. Initially it was believed that a water channel may have passed between the features.
The trench was 3.5 meters in length, 1 meter wide, and 1.2 meters in depth. The profiles of the trench
were very similar to the other trenches not associated with the brick features. The upper 20-30 cm
consisted of brown, silty loam with grass roots. Below this upper layer was the yellowish red silt with a
slight clay content. At approximately 90 cm below the surface, the soil changed to the dark brown clay
with carbonate streaks. One brick fragment was encountered in the upper 10 cm of the northern end of
the trench. The remainder of the soil strata did not contain any cultural material. There was no evidence
of a channel cut in the trench profiles.

Test Unit Excavation
One test unit was excavated within the site (Figure 5-1). Prior to placing the unit, sections of the surface
were cleared to locate the path of a brick alignment observed starting in the bank of Sawmill Lake. Once
an outline of the alignment was visible, a unit was placed along the north edge of the alignment. This unit
28

was designated as Test Unit 1.

TEST UNIT 1
Test Unit 1 (TU 1) was excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels to a terminal depth of 90 cm below datum
(cmbd). The datum was positioned north of the unit and 10 cm above the modern ground surface.
Excavation of the first level revealed there was a large quantity of fragmented brick and mortar. Due to
the large quantity of brick encountered and the question of transporting such material to the RKEI
Archaeology Laboratory, it was decided that only samples of the brick and mortar fragments were to be
collected rather than collect every piece. The brick alignment noted in the lake bank formed the southern
edge of the unit.
The excavation of Level 1 (3-10 cmbd) of TU 1focused on the removal of the vegetation covering the
surface of the site. As the grasses were cleared, it became evident that there was a high density of brick
fragment. The soil consisted of a compacted silty loam that was dark brown in color (7.5YR3/4).
Artifacts encountered included brick, mortar, and one fragment of animal bone (Table 5-1). There were
over 100 brick fragments noted that ranged in size from 5-15 cm in diameter. A sample of 31 fragments
of brick and four fragments of mortar were collected from this level (Table 5-1).

Level 2 (10-20 cmbd) encountered an increased density of brick and mortar fragments. The excavation
revealed bricks that appear to have been related to wall fall. The top of the alignment in the southern
portion of the unit was exposed further (Figure 5-11). Artifacts encountered in this level included brick,
29

mortar, animal remains, one metal bolt, two cut nails, pull tabs and mussel shell.

Figure 5-11. Level 2 (10-20 cmbd) of Test Unit 1 showing the wall fall encountered.
Level 3(20-30 cmbd) excavations focused on removing the wall fall that had been mapped in on the
previous level. The soil encountered in this level consisted of a brown (7.5YR5/4) silt with some clay
content. The wall fall was removed to reveal what appeared to be degraded mortar or lime in the western
half of the unit (Figure 5-12). The bricks varied in size from whole to small fragments. A few of the
bricks encountered exhibited a glaze. Artifacts recovered from the level included brick, mortar, charcoal,
and mussel shell. The excavation of the level produced over 100 fragments and whole bricks. A sample
of the brick fragments was collected. At the base of the level, a few additional bricks were noted that
were considered wall fall. The southern edge of the unit exposed more of the brick alignment, revealing
that it was at least two courses of brick deep.

30

Figure 5-12. Test Unit 1 Level 3 (20-30 cmbd) below the majority of the brick rubble and at the top of
the lime and mortar layer.
Level 4 (30-40 cmbd) removed more wall fall, but the density of bricks decreased in comparison to the
previous levels. A burned root was encountered in the center of the unit. The soil around it appeared to
be ash, but it also could have just been a mixture of lime and degraded mortar (Figure 5-13). The
consistency of the white (7.5YR8/1) matrix was fine and powdery. The surrounding soil was a slightly
darker brown (7.5YR4/4) silt than the previous level with some clay content. Artifacts collected in this
level included brick, mortar, charcoal, cut nails, and a bolt fragment. The density if the brick fragments
encounter was reduced in this level (n=<100).The brick alignment in the southern portion of the unit was
revealed to be at least 3 courses of brick deep, with a possible fourth course acting as a footer.

31

Figure 5-13. Level 4 (30-40 cmbd) in Test Unit 1showing the lime layer.
Level 5 (40-50 cmbd) exposed more of the burned root in the center of TU 1. Charcoal fragments were
present around the root. The soil encountered was a mix of the fine, powdery white ash/lime with brown
silt. The soil was fairly compacted, but the fineness of the ash/lime made digging in several areas easy.
The density of brick fragments decreased from the previous level. Artifacts collected included brick,
mortar, charcoal, and cut nails. The fourth course of brick was exposed and it is stepped from the upper
bricks (Figure 5-14). The layer extended approximately 8 cm from the upper brick courses.

32

Figure 5-14. Level 5 (40-50 cmbd) in Test Unit 1 revealing the footers of the wall.
Level 6 (50-60 cmbd) excavations allowed for the removal of the root that was approximately 8 cm in
diameter and extended through the middle portion of the unit from north to south. Charcoal was noted
around the root. The soil consisted of a strong brown (7.5YR4/6) silt with clay content. The lime/ash
pockets are still present, as well as small chunks of degrading mortar. The largest pocket was noted in the
southeast corner of the unit, abutting the brick wall. The soil in the northwest corner was more compact
than other areas in the unit. The brick wall fall density decreased in this level in comparison to the
previous level. Cultural material collected from this level included brick, glazed brick, mortar, charcoal,
cut nails, and a ferrous bolt fragment. Excavations along the brick wall uncovered another layer of
stepped brick (Figure 5-15), although it appears on the eastern half of the wall and not the entire length.
The excavations indicate that the wall is at least 5 courses tall.

33

Figure 5-15. Level 6 (50-60 cmbd) in Test Unit 1 showing the second course of footers.
Level 7 (60-70 cmbd) excavations revealed that the base of the wall was encountered in the previous
level. The wall is five courses of brick high, with the two bottom courses being stepped. The soil
encountered consisted of the strong brown silt with some clay content and pockets of lime and mortar
(Figure 5-16). There was a slight increase in the density of brick fragments encountered due to one of the
pockets of lime and mortar containing a concentration. Cultural material collected from this level
included brick, mortar, and a cut nail.

34

Figure 5-16. Bottom of Level 7 (60-70 cmbd) in Test Unit 1.
The soil excavated in Level 8 (70-80 cmbd) was deeper than the bottom of the brick wall. The soils were
very similar to the previous level, with strong brown silt and pockets of lime and mortar (Figure 5-17).
The brick density was low, and was encountered mostly within the pockets of lime and mortar. Artifacts
collected included brick, mortar, and one cut nail.

35

Figure 5-17. Level 8 (70-80 cmbd) in Test Unit 1.
Level 9 (80-90 cmbd) was the final level excavated in TU 1. The soil encountered was slightly darker
than the previous level, but this strong brown (7.5YR5/6) silt may have been due to the decrease in the
amount of lime and mortar inclusions in the level. The soil was extremely hard packed. Artifacts
encountered consisted of a few fragments of brick and mortar. Most of these fragments were from areas
just below the brick wall and confined to the upper few centimeters of the level. The compacted soil was
very similar to the yellowish red silt that had been noted in the backhoe trenches excavated around the
site. The façade of the brick wall was cleared and it appears that the wall sits atop a slightly jumbled
layer of brick fragments and soil, which is on top of the compacted yellowish red silt (Figure 5-18 and
Figure 5-19).

Features
Once backhoe trenching was completed, clearing of the surface of the features was undertaken. The brick
façades were cleared by hand using a trowel and brush. The top of the features were cleared by removing
the vegetation and using shovels and trowels to remove the soil layer. Ultimately, the clearing of the
surfaces allowed for the identification of three brick features.
None of the soil removed was screen, although artifacts were noted when they were encountered. Several
unique artifacts were collected during the clearing. Fragments of ferrous metal, cast iron, cut nails, and
lead were common materials encountered. Items that were unique or potentially diagnostic were
collected and returned to the RKEI laboratory for processing. Other materials were photo-documented in
the field. Less than 50 items were collected.

FEATURE 1
Feature 1 was originally identified in 2013 and lead to the designation of site 41FB339. Once cleared, the
feature revealed a stepped surface along the western side (Figure 5-20). The eastern portion exhibits
stepping, but it does not appear to be in the same design (Figure 5-21). This may be due to the eastern
edge being obscured by tree roots (Figure 5-22). Two keyholes were seen on the feature that went through
the entire width of the brick structure. The base of the feature was between 70 and 80 cm below surface.
The feature has its tallest point near the center and appears to step down on the edges. The dimensions of
the exposed brick feature measures 6.20 m (20.34 ft) on the top of the feature, 6.85 m (22.47 ft) at the
bottom of the feature, 1.11 m (3.64 ft) wide, and 78 cm (2.55 ft) high.

Figure 5-22. Top of the east end of Feature 1.
The north and south walls were similar, and exhibited two keyholes that seem to traverse the width of the
feature (Figure 5-23). The feature extends into the bank of Sawmill Lake, with what appears to be a
break in the feature in the eastern portion (Figure 5-24). Probing with a shovel did not encounter brick in
this area.

42

Figure 5-23. Feature 1 facing southwest showing keyholes on the north façade.

Figure 5-24. Break in Feature 1.
The dimensions of the feature are 1.2 m wide, 70 cm deep at the tallest point, and 7 meters in length. The
bricks are whitewashed, which is most evident on the western façade. On the surface, clearing produced
43

several artifacts including a brown glass bottle lip, a twentieth century pocket knife, cut nails, faunal
remains, and a few unidentified ferrous fragments.

FEATURE 2
Feature 2 is located approximately 1.5 meters to the north of Feature 1. The western edge of Feature 2
aligns with the western edge of Feature 1. The eastern edges do not appear to match. The southern
façade of Feature 2 does not extend into the bank of Sawmill Lake. Clearing of the feature revealed much
wall fall and jumble in this area, but no distinct alignment was observed. The southern façade ranged
from four to six courses of brick high. The bricks are stepped to the surface, although the stacking of the
bricks varies from lengthwise to transverse throughout the profile. The bricks are white washed, with
pockets of lime and mortar present throughout the length of the southern face of the feature.

The

southern edge of the feature was the most complete exposure. The northern edge was revealed in Test
Unit 1. The wall was five courses of brick high on the north façade, and has both transversely and
lengthwise placed bricks. Exposing the surface of the feature offered some clues to the dimensions of the
structure, but also brought some confusion. The feature is at least 2.8 meters wide, but the east-west
dimension was hard to determine due to an area along the southern wall that appears to be missing. The
north wall appears to be approximately 8 meters in length. The western wall façade was not exposed due
to its proximity to Feature 3, but the exposure of the surface of Feature 2’s western area indicated a brick
surface that sloped towards Feature 3. There may have been a connection with bricks between Feature 2
and 3, but this could not be determined during the site investigations. The western portion of Feature 2
appears to have some notch-like niches (Figure 5-25). The eastern portion of the feature consists of a
brick foundation that is three courses of brick wide (approximately 30 cm), with at least one identifiable
cross-support running north-south. The northern foundation extends to the east into the bank of Sawmill
Lake. The interior of the feature exhibits some brick rubble, but no indication of a solid platform of brick.
It is likely that this feature was used as a foundation for a wooden structure. The bricks are white washed
on the surface and wall façade.
Artifacts encountered while clearing Feature 2 included a metal plate, a metal ring (Figure 5-26), faunal
remains, cut nails, and a few unidentifiable ferrous fragments.

FEATURE 3
Feature 3 appears to be a solid brick platform with notches in the surface. The feature is rectangular in
shape, and slightly narrower than Feature 2. The platform is five courses of bricks, with the bottom two
45

courses of bricks stepped (Figure 5-27). Once cleared, the dimensions of the platform were 2.4 meters
wide (north-south), 2.4 meters long (east-west), and approximately 45 cm below surface at its tallest
points. As the soil was cleared around the feature, archaeologists encountered a jumble of bricks, brick
fragments, mortar fragments, and lime.

Figure 5-27. Southern wall of Feature 3.
The southeastern corner of Feature 3 is aligned with the western edge of Feature 1. There appears to be a
space between Feature 2 and Feature 3 (approximately 30 cm) that is filled with brick rubble, lime, and
mortar. There may be a connection between the two features along the eastern wall, but the nature of the
connection was not determined. Bricks were noted on the surface at the center of the eastern wall of
Feature 2 and the western wall of Feature 3 that are aligned, forming a paved surface between the two.
The wall exterior surfaces of Feature 3 have been white washed. The surface of the feature also exhibits
white washing, which was thick in the northwestern portion of the platform surface. Clearing of the
feature revealed notches and grooves on the surface. Clearing of the southern portion of the feature’s
surface revealed a narrow channel, one course of brick wide, one course of brick deep, and two courses of
brick long, that contained a collection of artifacts (Figure 5-28, Table 5-2). A clear glass bottle with a
46

pontil mark was recovered in the upper sediment in the channel. A metal cowbell, a ceramic pipe bowl,
faunal remains, and a cuprous rivet were also uncovered in the niche. The niche appears to be an
intentional creation although it is unclear what purpose it served.

Another channel in the brick surface was identified in the western wall of the feature (Figure 5-29). This
channel was approximately 30 cm wide, two courses of brick deep (approximately 20 cm), at extended at
least 70 cm to the east. It is likely that the channel extended further to the east, but due to time
47

constraints, that portion of the surface was not uncovered. A few fragments of ferrous metal were noted
in the sediment, and one cut nail. Similar to the other channel uncovered, this appears to be an intentional
construction as the brick surfaces are white washed.

The southern wall of Feature 3 is aligned with the southern wall of Feature 2. Reviewing the planview
and photographs reveals that the northern wall of Feature 2 is offset by approximately 40 cm from the
edge of the northern wall of Feature 3 (Figure 5-28).

Chapter 6 Discussion of Artifacts Recovered
A total of 386 artifacts were collected during the excavations and backhoe trenching conducted at
41FB339 during the 2014 season. The collection represents items recovered during the excavations, but
only a sample of brick and mortar from the units were returned to the laboratory. The only items
collected during the clearing were items that were unique or potentially diagnostic. The artifacts fell into
five main categories: construction materials, bone, glass, metal items, and personal items. Each of these
artifact categories offers insight to the use and temporal affiliation of the site.

Construction Materials
Construction materials recovered from the site fell into two categories: brick and mortar. All the brick
and mortar was related to the three features that were uncovered during excavation and backhoe
trenching. The brick encountered came in three varieties. All varieties appear to have been locally made
as they do not exhibit manufacturing marks. The most common variety is a soft, fine pasted, salmon
colored brick (Figure 6-1). These bricks are typically under-fired and porous (Colonial Williamsburg
2014). Within the brick kilns, the temperature of firing varies. Approximately half of each batch fired
would have been well fired. The remainder of the batch consisted of the salmon, under-fired variety, or
over-fired bricks that were referred to as “clinkers” (Colonial Williamsburg 2014). Another variety noted
at 41FB339 exhibited a coating on portions that resembled a glaze (Figure 6-2). The glaze was not
uniform on the brick and was not intentionally applied. These glaze bricks were likely facing the kiln fire
and received the glaze as the wood ash from the fire combined with vaporized sand (McDowell 2009:6).
The brick clay appears to be fine, similar to the salmon bricks, but are higher fired and not as porous. The
third variety noted at the site has been referred to as a “clinker” (Wetherell and Kmet 1991; Colonial
Williamsburg 2014). The “clinker” is an over-fired brick that usually has a much darker color than the
others. These have been too close to the fire and, when extracted from the kiln, exhibit a much darker
color than the rest of the batch (VanHecke 2006). The “clinkers” encountered at the site were denser than
the other bricks (Figure 6-3). These bricks also appear to exhibit a courser matrix, with large inclusions
of grog and small gravel.

Figure 6-3. Course brick recovered from the site.
All three of these brick types would likely have been manufactured during the occupation at the
plantation.
Mortar was also recovered at the site. The mortar consisted of a mixture of lime and sand. Fragments
were encountered in all areas around the three brick features. The mortar would have been made on site
to be used when laying the brick. In addition to the mortar, lime residue was noted that was due to the
white washing of the bricks.

ANIMAL BONE
The faunal remains encountered at the site were few (less than 20 fragments). Only seven fragments were
collected and returned to the laboratory. The larger fragments of bone encountered appeared to have
belonged to either cow or hog. Wild hogs currently inhabit the property, and were noted on one occasion
during the field project. When the plantation was purchased by the Scanlin sisters, the plantation away
from cultivating cane and cotton to ranching. Raising cattle had become the plantations main purpose
after 1913. Cattle leases are still active on a large portion of the Sienna Plantation currently no
developed.

52

GLASS
Only a few glass fragments were noted during the clearing of the features. Only two were of any interest.
While clearing the surface of Feature 1, a brown glass bottle lip was encountered. The examination of the
specimen indicated that the bottle had an applied lip. This results from applying hot glass to the vessel to
form a finish. The style of the finish varied by the type of bottle that was being created. The specimen
noted at 41FB339 appear to be an oil finish. The oil finish was one of the most common type of finish
used on bottles manufactured between the 1830s to the 1920s (SHA 2014).
The second item of importance was the clear glass bottle with the pontil mark on the base (Figure 6-4).
This bottle was recovered from within the narrow niche during the clearing of Feature 3. The pontil mark
is created during the glass blowing process of the vessel. The mark is the result of the vessel being
attached to a pontil rod. The manufacture of glass vessels using the pontil rod predated occupation of the
site in other corners of the world (Kendrick 1966). For the case of this specimen, it was likely
manufactured sometime between the 1830s and the 1870s (SHA 2014). The use of the pontil rod
decreased at the end of the Civil War period due to the introduction of the snap-case rod (Kendrick 1966).

METAL ITEMS
Metal items fell into three categories: fasteners, metal fragments, and identifiable metal objects. A total
of 29 metal artifacts were collected from the site, although there were additional items observed in the
field. Metal fasteners comprised the largest portion of the metal artifact assemblage with 25 specimens.
Of the 25 metal fasteners collected in Test Unit 1, 22 were cut nails. Cut nails generally predate 1880 due
to the introduction of machine made wire nails that became the predominant type by the turn of the
century (Fox et al 1997). Many other cut nails were noted during the clearing of the Features, although
not collected. A rough estimate would be that approximately 20 more cut nails were observed. No other
variety of nail was noted at the site which is consistent with the dates of occupation and use of the
plantation during the nineteenth century.
Bolt fragments were another variety of metal fasteners recovered at the site. Three bolt fragments were
collected in Test Unit 1. All three were not complete, and appeared to have been sheared off. The bolts
exhibit heavy corrosion.
In addition to the metal fasteners, fragments of metal were encountered while clearing the brick features.
The majority of the metal encountered was ferrous, but there were also a few fragments of lead. These
unidentified fragments of metal were not collected during the clearing.
Several identified metal items were observed during the clearing. Ferrous metal plates were noted along
Feature 2, but these did not appear to be attached to anything. A metal pocket knife was encountered on
the surface of Feature 1. This item likely dates to the twentieth century. A large, broken ferrous ring was
encountered at the edge of Feature 1. It appears that the ring was whole at one time, but only ¾ of it was
present. The function of the ring is unknown. Broken ferrous brackets were noted while cleaning Feature
3. Two were encountered while clearing, but were not collected. One ferrous cowbell was collected
while cleaning out the narrow notch on the surface of Feature 2. This item was collected. Aluminum pull
tabs were encountered both in Test Unit 1 and during the clearing of the brick features. The pull tabs,
though diagnostic, are more modern material in comparison to the rest of the artifacts encountered. Pull
tabs became popular by the 1960s and were all but extinct by the 1980s. The pull tabs were found in the
upper 10 cm of sediment at the site.

PERSONAL ITEMS
A few items recovered were classified as personal items. One was a metal cow bell (Figure 6-5). The
cow bell was recovered while clearing Feature 3, from within the narrow niche. The cow bell is 8 cm tall,
54

with a handle 1 cm from the top of the bell. The bell was a maximum width of 7 cm, and the opening was
5 cm across. The bell appears to be relatively small to be a bell for cattle and may have more likely the
size used for sheep or goat. Due to the history of the plantation, it is likely that the bell is related to the
occupation by the Scanlin sisters.

Figure 6-5. Cow bell recovered from Feature 3.
A ceramic reed stem pipe bowl was also recovered from within the narrow niche on Feature 3 (Figure 66). The pipe bowl appears to be a stoneware ceramic with a lead glaze. The design of pipe bowl is very
similar to ones that were made in Point Pleasant, Clermont County, Ohio between 1838 and 1890
(Murphy 1976). It appears that Ohio was a larger producer of the reed pipes as other potters in the region
produced the wares between the early 1800s into the mid-1900s (Rams Horn Studio 2014). Similar
varieties were noted in a dump feature related to the Akron Smoking Pipe Co. in Mogadore, Ohio
(Murphy and Reich 1974). Other manufacturers were based out of Virgina (i.e. Pamplin Pipe Factory
1878-1951) (Schroder 2011). Although these potters have manufactured similar items, the pipe bowl
recovered from 41FB339 does not match the typical decoration design.

Another personal item was a cuprous clothing stud (Figure 6-7). Often, this type of closure is associated
with blue jeans. It is possible, but not definite, that the cuprous stud is from a pair of jeans.

Chapter 7 Discussion and Recommendations
The NRHP eligibility testing of Site 41FB339 was conducted over four days in August of 2014. The
investigation consisted of the excavation of one 1-x-1 meter test unit to gather a detailed understanding of
the stratigraphy of the site and backhoe trenching to reveal and determine the extent of the brick features.
The surface of the brick features was also cleared to attempt to define the function and use of the features.
Three brick features were recorded during the course of the project. Feature 1 was located in the southern
region of the site. It consisted of a narrow brick platform that was approximately 80 cm deep at the
highest point, and 1.5 meters wide. The feature was approximately 8 meters in length and extended to the
edge of the bank of Sawmill Lake. Feature 1 exhibited two sets of keyholes on the north and south
façades. These keyholes extend the entire width of the feature. A break in the brick alignment was noted
along the eastern portion of the feature.
The excavation of the 1-x-1 meter unit revealed much brick and mortar rubble against the northern wall of
Feature 2. Once the face of the wall was revealed, it was evident that the bricks had been white washed.
This may be the reason that the unit encountered pockets of lime in the matrix abutting the wall. The
artifact assemblage recovered during the excavation included a high density of bricks and brick
fragments, and mortar. Cut nails and faunal remains comprised a much smaller portion of the
assemblage. Overall, there was a lack of cultural material that gave definitive insight to the use of the
features uncovered.
Trenching around 41FB339 revealed that there were three brick features that comprise a larger area that
originally anticipated. The trenching also showed that the density of cultural materials decreased rapidly
beyond the brick features. Backhoe trenching beyond 4 meters from the brick features did not produce
cultural material, less a few fragments of bricks near the surface that may have been deposited during
flooding episodes at the site.
Clearing of the brick features revealed much about the construction and treatment of the site. The brick
features are situated in two alignments. Feature 1 was located perpendicular to Sawmill Lake and
composed a brick platform with two keyhole openings that spanned the width of the structure. The
platform appears to have been taller in the center, with the west edge stepped. The surface of Feature 1
was white washed. Feature 2 appears to be a brick foundation for a structure. The brick walls were three
courses of brick wide. At least two cross-walls were noted when clearing the surface of the feature. The
north wall of the feature was noted in Test Unit 1. The surfaces of the bricks in Feature 2 were white
washed. Feature 3 was located to the west of Feature 2. These two features are in an east-west
57

alignment, although Feature 2 appears to be slightly wider. The south walls of the feature line up. The
north walls of the features do not, with the outer edge of the north wall of Feature 2 being approximately
30 cm further to the north. The surfaces of the bricks associated with Feature 3 have all been white
washed.
Artifacts encountered during the clearing included a large quantity of brick and brick fragments, mortar
fragments, cut nails, ferrous fragments, lead fragments, metal brackets/plates, faunal remains, and an iron
rail fragment. A few items were collected during the clearing due to their unique nature. While clearing
the narrow niche on the surface of Feature 3, a glass bottle with a pontil mark, a cuprous rivet, a ferrous
cow bell, and a ceramic reed pipe bowl were collected. These items combined appear to date to the midto late 1800s. In addition, all the nails encountered at the site were cut nails that fell out of use by the
1890s. It would be safe to infer that the structure was constructed before 1890.
No machinery or other items that could specifically indicate that the brick features were part of a sawmill,
but the feature offers some hints. The few metal items encountered could be part of a large machine.
Historical accounts indicate that once a location had served its purpose, items of worth (such as a
sawmill) would have been removed to another location. The area would typically be cleared of all
associated material during the move. The rail fragment that was encountered may be related to a track
needed for a portion of the machinery associated with a sawmill.
The bricks at the site were all whitewashed. Whitewashing was a technique that was used for several
different reasons. Whitewash is typically composed of a mixture of lime and water, with a binder or other
additive to help improve durability and color. Whitewash is best used on rough, porous surfaces and
forms a thin film of plaster. Bricks would have been an ideal surface to whitewash. Whitewashing would
create a surface that was considered “sanitary” the lime mixture would deter the growth of bacteria and
mold. If whitewashing was used on wood, it would help to prevent decay. In addition to preventing
decay, whitewashing would act to protect the surfaces from insects (GSA 2014). This would be a benefit
if the site was used as a sawmill, creating sawdust that would attract insects.
The brick features were not large enough to support a structure that used water power to run the mill.
Rather, based on its size, the site may have been equipped with a small steam engine that serviced the
sawmill. The steam engine would have powered the sawmill, using the wood chips and scrap wood waste
products produced by the milling as fuel. A steam engine would be somewhat portable in the sense that it
was mounted on wheels and could be moved when the mill location needed. The saw would be mounted
on a platform with a moving cart to transport the logs. A close example of what may have operated at the
58

site is present at the Cradle of Forestry near Brevard, North Carolina. The sawmill represents one that
was likely constructed ca. 1889, although the technology was brought to North America by the 1820s
(Cooper 1994).
Even a sawmill this small could produce a decent quantity of lumber every day. It is likely that the mill
would have been producing wood planks during a time at the plantation when construction of housing,
storage facilities, stores, and commissary were underway. According to the history of the Arcola
Plantation, the peak of construction at the Arcola Plantation occurred during the 1880s when House, Jr.
worked to expand the plantation’s production after his father’s death (LifeontheBrazosRiver 2013). There
is a chance that the mill was functioning prior to then as the plantation had been in existence for
approximately 50 years prior, but since the feature does not appear on the 1890 or the 1907 maps of the
plantation, it probably was not in use at those dates.
The removal of the machinery and all associated material has severely affected the integrity of the site
and left little to warrant the nomination of the feature as eligible to the National Register of Historic
Places. Therefore, RKEI recommends that the site is not eligible for listing to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) because it lacks integrity.
