Report Title: Intensive Archaeological Survey of 19 Miles of the Liberty to Wink Petroleum Pipeline Project, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas
Report Date: August 2019
Report Number: 19-268
Agency: University Lands
Permit Number: TAC 8919
Project Description: Paleowest conducted archival research, agency coordination, a 100 percent
pedestrian survey, and extensive shovel testing of approximately 19 miles for the proposed Liberty
to Wink pipeline project, across a 300-foot survey corridor (approximately 702 acres) in Ward and
Winkler Counties, Texas. The entirety of the proposed pipeline corridor is owned by the University
Lands of the University of Texas system. The project was conducted consistent with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT, Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resource Code), the Rules of
Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Code (Title 13, Chapter 26 of the Texas Administrative Code [13 TAC 26]), and under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit 8919.
One archaeological site (41WK131) was recorded on University of Texas oil lease lands, adjacent to and overlapping the east edge of the survey corridor in Winkler County, Texas. The site
consists of a historic-age corral remnant and artifact scatter dating to ca. 1960. No residential
or other cultural features were observed. The artifact scatter is low density and confined to the
surface. Four potentially diagnostic glass bottles were collected and analyzed. Archival research
indicates no associations of the corral site with any specific owners other than the University
Lands. Site 41WK131 is recommended as not eligible as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for no further archaeological
investigations. A total of 801 negative shovel tests (STs) and Observed Test Locations (OTLs)
were mapped and recorded during the project. No other cultural sites were identified within the
survey area (702 acres).
Acres Surveyed: Approximately 702 acres
Project Number: 19-114
Project Location: Approximately 19 miles of proposed oil pipeline are identified beginning in
Ward County, Texas, at Interstate Highway (IH) 20, proceeding north into oil-developed lands
owned by the University of Texas, then north into Winkler County, and terminating near the tiny
oil community of Wink.

CHAPTER 1. MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PaleoWest, LLC. (PaleoWest), is supporting Salt Creek Midstream, LLC. (Salt Creek), and Quanta
Pipeline Services, Inc. (Quanta), in providing cultural resource coordination for a proposed crude
oil pipeline project in Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas (Figure 1). Paleowest conducted archival
research, agency coordination, a 100 percent pedestrian survey and extensive shovel testing of
approximately 19 miles for the proposed Liberty to Wink pipeline project across a 300-foot survey
corridor (approximately 702 acres). The entirety of the proposed pipeline right-of-way is owned by
the University Lands of the University of Texas system. The project was conducted consistent with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT, Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resource Code),
the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Code (Title 13, Chapter 26 of the
Texas Administrative Code [13 TAC 26]), and under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit 8919.
From Interstate Highway (IH) 20 to the northern project terminus (MP 21.1â39), a total of 670
negative shovel tests (STs) were excavated, and 131 Observed Test Locations (OTLs) were
mapped and recorded (Figures 2â5). One archaeological site (41WK131) was recorded, adjacent
to and overlapping the east edge of the survey corridor at approximately MP 37 (Figures 6 and
7; see Figure 2). The site consists of a historic-age corral remnant and artifact scatter dating
to ca. 1960. No residential or other cultural features were observed. The artifact scatter is low
density and confined to the surface. Four potentially diagnostic glass bottles were collected and
analyzed. Archival research indicates no associations of the corral site with any specific owners
other than the University Lands. Site 41WK131 is recommended not eligible as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) or for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for no
further archaeological investigations.
An interim letter summary report of these investigations was submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) on July 8, 2019. The letter requested concurrence with the recommendation for
site 41WK131. The interim letter requested concurrence that sufficient information was presented
in the report for the THC to grant permission for the 19-mile proposed pipeline project to proceed
with regard to the Antiquities Code of Texas. This request was based on the premise that a full
report of investigations and professional curation would follow to complete TAC Permit 8919. In
a response dated August 6, 2019, the THC concurred with the information provided in the interim
report, and that site 41WK131 is not eligible for designation as an SAL.
This final report is presented in partial completion of TAC Permit 8919 with professional curation
to follow of all project-related materials at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, to complete the TAC permit.

CHAPTER 2. INTRODUCTION
PaleoWest conducted intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of approximately 19 miles
of proposed oil pipeline beginning in Ward County, Texas at IH 20, proceeding north into oildeveloped lands owned by the University of Texas, then north into Winkler County, and terminating
near the tiny oil community of Wink. All of the lands north of IH 20 crossed by the proposed
pipeline are University of Texas lands (MP 21â40). The width of the survey corridor was 300 feet
and a total of approximately 702 acres were surveyed.
Project Area Description
The current project area is located in the Toyah Basin physical region, and the Trans-Pecos
ecoregion of Texas (TPWD 2018; TSHA 2018; USDA 2015). This region has evidence of a lengthy
but relatively undocumented sequence of cultural occupations spanning the Paleoindian, Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic, and the Formative/Late Prehistoric periods. Archaic, and Formative/
Late Prehistoric occupation sites can be found in the deep bottomlands adjacent to drainages such
as the Pecos River. Both occupation and lithic procurement/quarry sites may be in high, relatively
flat locations overlooking drainages and at natural resource outcroppings of chert. Rockshelter
and rock art sites may also be present. Historic-age occupations have also been found. Thus,
any proposed project areas must be intensively surveyed for both prehistoric and historic sites
including subsurface testing.
While settlement is generally not to be expected in areas of slope exceeding 12 percent, these areas
must be examined especially if densely vegetated, although shovel testing may not be necessary
or need not be conducted as systematically on these slopes. STs must be systematically placed to
the depth of Holocene deposits in the flat bottomlands, in relatively flat areas overlooking drainage
basins, and in all densely vegetated areas except where slopes exceed 12 percent. These slope areas
should be transected, but at lesser intervals than high probability or site areas. The horizontal extent
of areas with greater than 12 percent slope should be mapped with GPS units. Any discovered sites
should be shovel tested (see below).
Summary of Archaeological Work Performed
Prior to fieldwork, PaleoWest conducted background research using available publications, manuscripts, site records and state files (including NRHP site files) from the THC sites Atlas, historic General Land Office (GLO) maps, and United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic
quadrangle maps (both modern and historic). The purpose of the archival research was to identify
any previously recorded archaeological sites (to procure site forms), historic structures, districts,
markers, properties listed on the NRHP, and any SALs for the project area. PaleoWest obtained
copies of all necessary Texas site forms for archaeological sites in the area from the THC sites
Atlas for review and to update the forms if necessary based on survey results. PaleoWest was able
13

PaleoWest Archaeology

to document the land ownership and use of the land in the project area. Ownership was then compared to local, state, and federal histories to assist in determining NRHP eligibility with regard to
the potential association with important events or persons. USDA soil maps and USGS geologic
maps were consulted to determine the probability and relative depth of quaternary or Holocene
alluvial deposits in the environmental settings of the proposed project area.
PaleoWest conducted a complete pedestrian inventory of the project area using visual survey and
shovel testing. In the field, archaeologists followed predetermined transects, and ST spacing was
programmed into handheld Trimble GeoXT GPS units with submeter accuracy. When the field
crew encountered unexpected field conditions, adjustments were made in the field and noted, and
extreme deviations were recorded in the Trimble units. STs, sites, and features were recorded in
the field with the Trimble units. At times, heavy cloud cover reduced Trimble accuracy; thus, some
points were unable to be locked in with the GPS and had to be mapped by means of distance and
bearing. Less than one percent of points had to be recorded in this manner.
All field investigations were consistent with the requirements of Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the
NHPA of 1966 (as amended 1992) and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act of 1990, All work met acceptable professional and safety standards. PaleoWest personnel met
all requirements to carry out archaeological investigations on private lands, including those listed
under the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Archaeology and Historic Preservation.
All artifacts gathered in the field were temporarily transferred to the PaleoWest laboratory in
Austin, Texas, for processing and analysis. The artifacts were cleaned, cataloged, labeled, and
analyzed. This information was entered into an Excel spreadsheet for efficient organization and
data retrieval, and to facilitate analysis and report production. PaleoWest processed artifacts for
curation in accordance with 36 CFR Part 79 and in accordance with the curation agreement entered
into by PaleoWest and the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) curation facility/
facilities. Following completion of the project, all artifacts, notes and records will be curated at
TARL. These artifacts were processed, analyzed, and prepared for curation consistent with federal
and TARL standards. PaleoWest will retain a copy of all field notes, analyses, site forms, and other
data at the Austin office.
Personal Commitment
PaleoWest personnel commitment time consisted of pre-field archival research, fieldwork, report
preparation, and curation. The pre-field archival research consisted of two days in the Austin
office. The archaeological survey was conducted over the course of seven working days in May.
James Karbula functioned as Principal Investigator and Jeremy Loven as Project Archaeologist.
Field staff included Ben Shirar and Scott Cole. James Karbula and Nicole Inskeep prepared the
final report in August 2019. PaleoWest editor Lindsay Wygant edited and assembled the final
report. PaleoWest GIS specialist Kathleen Markam produced the report maps and illustrations.

CHAPTER 3. ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
A records and literature search was conducted for the proposed project location to identify any
previously conducted surveys, archaeological sites, or other cultural resources within 500 feet
of the pipeline centerline (1000-foot corridor centered on the pipeline centerline). PaleoWest
reviewed the THC and NRHP Atlas for information on previously recorded archaeological sites,
previous surveys, and Historic Properties (THC 2015). Six previously recorded archaeological
surveys intersect, overlap, or parallel the archival corridor (Table 1). Two of these are large
seismic surveys conducted on University of Texas lands. No previously recorded archaeological
sites, NRHP-eligible properties, cemeteries, SALs, historic markers, or Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks are located within the survey corridor.
Much of the approximately 19 miles of the proposed pipeline has been surveyed recently, is heavily
modified oil land (wells, access roads, petroleum storage tanks), or is a combination of the two,
with very low potential for intact prehistoric or historic-age archaeological sites.
Research was conducted at the Winkler County courthouse in Kermit, Texas, to determine land
ownership of the corral (41WK131). Records at the courthouse were organized by current landowner
and not legal description and little information was available. After a discussion with the University
of Texas Easements and Commercial Leases representatives from the Midland office of University
Lands Representatives, it was determined that the State acquired ownership of the Lands from
Mexico in 1836, and that these University Lands never left the sovereign of the State. The current
project area is part of over 2.1 million acres that were awarded to the University of Texas by the
Texas Constitution as Permanent University Fund (PUF) lands in 1876. There is no association of
the corral site with any specific person or owner other than the University. It is unknown how many
ranchers may have grazed that area, and whether they had any permits or leases to do so through
many years.

CHAPTER 4. PROJECT AREA CULTURE HISTORY
The current pipeline project in Winkler and Ward Counties, Texas, is located in the Chihuahuan
Basins and Playas ecoregion and the Toyah Basin physical region of Texas. This is part of the
larger Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, which extends nearly 500 miles south into Mexico. This
basin and playa ecoregion consists of alluvial fans, internally drained basins, and river valleys
located below 3500 feet, and the Toyah Basin is the remnant of a Quaternary-aged seabed (Griffith
et al. 2004; TSHA 2018). In Texas, the area west of (and partially including) Winkler and Crane
Counties is referred to as the Trans-Pecos (Griffith et al. 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; TPWD
2018). The Trans-Pecos region is divided into eastern and western segments. The western segment
includes El Paso, Hudspeth, and the western half of Culberson Counties, and is dominated by the
Jornada Mogollon culture of the greater southwest. The remaining counties (eastern Culberson,
Reeves, Jeff Davis, Presidio, Brewster, Pecos, Ward, Loving, Winkler and Crane, Ector and
Upton) make up the eastern Trans-Pecos region of Texas. This boundary is arbitrary and is marked
by the absence of ceramics and architecture found among the Jornada Mogollon culture to the
west (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The culture history presented in this report will focus on the
Trans-Pecos region as a whole, noting the eastern Trans-Pecos region when available, as that is the
region identified by the project area.
Prehistoric Adaptation Models: General Trends
The Trans-Pecos is documented as having a rich woodlands and grasslands environment with
reliable water sources in the mountain ranges through the end of the Pleistocene. At this time, a
drying trend, triggered by a large erosional event ca. 7000 B.C., persisted until the Middle Holocene
when semiarid climate trends and drought-resistant vegetation was becoming established. By the
Late Holocene, the desert conditions of today were present (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Paleoindian communities are typically viewed as being small, highly mobile bands that depended on
large mammal game for subsistence. Despite the harsh appearance of the Trans-Pecos, Paleoindian
inhabitants utilized the abundant flora and fauna of the ecoregion for daily use. Cacti, sotol, agave,
and screwbean mesquite were used for food, fiber, fuel, construction, and medicine. Faunal resources
consisted of rabbit, pronghorn deer, various reptiles, rodents, and fish. Megafauna including bison,
mastodon, and mammoth were used as primary sources of subsistence. As the semiarid trends of the
Chihuahuan desert became more established, these large mammals became extinct and the water
sources depleted. As regional conditions became more unpredictable, inhabitants undoubtedly
altered their subsistence and mobility patterns (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Prehistoric Culture History
The prehistoric period refers to the time of earliest human occupation in the area to the time of
European contact and Exploration. Across most of Texas, these time periods generally include
Paleoindian (10,000â6000 B.C.), Archaic (6000 B.C.âA.D. 200), and Formative period/Late
19

PaleoWest Archaeology

Prehistoric (A.D. 200â1450) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Due to the environmental and ecological diversity of Texas, these dates will vary depending on geographic location in the state. The
dates noted above are valid for our discussion in the Trans-Pecos region.
Paleoindian (10,000â6000 B.C.)
The extent of the Paleoindian prehistory in the Trans-Pecos region remains limited. This is
mostly due to the paucity of documented Paleoindian sites, as most artifacts have been limited to
isolated finds of diagnostic projectile points. Currently, the only chronometric date to support a
Paleoindian occupation in the Trans-Pecos region comes from a 9,000 year old hearth uncovered
one meter below the surface from Big Bend National Park. However, numerous manifestations of
a Paleoindian presence have been recorded along the Pecos River Valley, the Stockton Plateau,
the Big Bend region, the Marfa Plains, and in the Hueco/Tularosa Bolson. These assemblages
include diagnostic points and point fragments from Clovis, Folsom, and Midland Complexes, as
well as Late Paleoindian complexes such as Plainview, Firstview, Golodrina, Angostura, Eden,
and Scottsbluff. Lithic debitage, non-diagnostic points and point fragments, and steep-edged angle
tools were also among the recorded cultural material (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Seebach 2019).
Archaic (6,000 B.C.âA.D. 200)
The Archaic period encompasses more than six thousand years, which is generally divided into the
Early Archaic (6000â4000/3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000/3000â1200 B.C), and Late Archaic
(1200 B.C.âA.D. 200/900). Because these dates are based loosely upon paleoenvironment and
paleoclimate variables, they may vary between the Eastern and Western segments of the TransPecos (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Mallouf 1985).
Archaic sites have been documented throughout the region by investigating rockshelter and open
air sites, which have provided insight into evolved subsistence and mobility patterns to accommodate the more arid climates of the Trans-Pecos region. Some of the more notable adaptations
are the habitation of more permanent domiciles such as pithouses or âhutsâ and the use of rocks
in thermal features. Subsistence adaptations include the diversification of consumed flora, as well
as limited mobility ranges which may have contributed to the adoption of agriculture (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004).
Little is known about the Early Archaic period (6000â4000/3000 B.C.) in the Trans-Pecos region.
Evidence showing an Early Archaic occupation in the western segments is limited to a few surficial finds of diagnostic projectile points, shallow rockshelter deposits, and a limited number of
radiocarbon dates. The Eastern Trans-Pecos segment is limited to cross-referencing diagnostic
projectile points and a single radiocarbon date associated with the Phantom Springs site (41JD63)
dating from 5300â4700 B.C. Despite the lack of data regarding Early Archaic occupations, the
increased number of thermal features along with the appearance of ground stone tools suggests
an increase in plant processing. Additionally, dated thermal features provide evidence for the use
20

Intensive Archaeological Survey of
19 Miles of the Liberty to Wink Pipeline Project, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas

of rocks as heating elements (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). During this period, projectile point
forms evolve from the Paleoindian lanceolate form to a stemmed form (Jay, Uvalde, and Bajada),
marking a change in hafting technologies. Additional lithic changes include the use of a locally
sourced coarse-grained chert, which may indicate a more limited mobility pattern (Turner et al.
2011; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The Middle Archaic period (4000/3000â1200 B.C.) initially appears to be an extension of the
Early Archaic regarding subsistence and technological adaptations in the Trans-Pecos region.
Radiocarbon dates continue to be rare during the first half of the period until ca. 2500 B.C. when
dated cultural materials increase as the emergence of more permanent residential structures or
âhutsâ emerge (Keystone Dam 33, 41EP493). Site density in the eastern Trans-Pecos region
increases during this period, as do the size and number of thermal features at the sites, which
may indicate larger settlements. Additionally, lithic technologies noticeably change across the
Trans-Pecos region. Serrated or beveled blades are utilized, which are distinctive to the Middle
Archaic period, along with two prominent form modifications: a contracting stem with a rounded
or pointed base and an expanding stem with a concave base. This latter form is commonly used by
inhabitants of the western segment of the region. These tend to be of the Trans-Pecos, Coahuilan,
and Conhise traditions, whereas the contracting stem forms are favored by the eastern Trans-Pecos
inhabitants, who favor the Central Texas, Coahuilan, and Lower Pecos traditions (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Mallouf 1985; Turner et al. 2011).
The Late Archaic period dates to approximately 1200 B.C.âA.D. 200/900, depending on western
or eastern segment occupation. A hallmark of this period is a significant increase in site density
throughout the entirety of the Trans-Pecos region. Late Archaic components and occupations are
abundant in basin landforms, as well as alluvial fans where components have been recovered from
both surface and buried contexts. Rockshelters in both the western and eastern segments of the
region document considerable Late Archaic deposits, and new environmental settings are occupied
in the eastern segment including river terraces not prone to flooding, higher mountain elevations,
bolsons, and spring areas. This region-wide expanse in site density and environmental settings has
been attributed to a wetter environment which lasted until approximately 550 B.C. (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004; Mallouf 1985). The Late Archaic is also marked by the introduction of cultigens
in the western Trans-Pecos region. This introduction into horticulture can loosely be dated to ca.
1550â1050 B.C. and includes maize and beans. In the eastern segment of the region, hunting and
gathering continued to play a prominent role in subsistence. In the lowlands, hunting was restricted
to small game as the medium to large game had moved on (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Additionally, the Late Archaic period marks another significant modification to lithic projectile point forms
by incorporating corner- and side-notched forms as well as manufacturing smaller projectile points
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Turner et al. 2011).
Formative Period/Late Prehistoric (A.D. 200â1450)
The Formative period is restricted to the western segment of the Trans-Pecos region. The La Junta
District (near Big Bend National Park) in the southeastern portion of the eastern Trans-Pecos
21

PaleoWest Archaeology

region followed a similar pattern. However, occupants of more eastern regions of the Trans-Pecos
are not documented to same degree and generic Late Prehistoric intervals have been assigned.
The Formative period can be divided into three phases; Mesilla (A.D. 900â1100), Dona Ana (A.D.
1100â1200), and El Paso (A.D. 1200â1400). During the Mesilla phase, we see the emergence
of ceramics (El Paso Brown and nonlocal Mimbres White Ware), pithouse architecture, and the
continued use of hunting and gathering subsistence strategies. Cultigens during this time play a
minor role. During the Dona Ana phase, architecture begins to transition from pithouse to Puebloan-style dwellings, ceramic diversity is marked by the incorporation of color into the El Paso
ceramic tradition (El Paso plain brown, bichrome, and polychrome), and social exchange is noted
via the utilization of nonlocal ceramics. The El Paso phase is marked by agriculturally dependent communities, pueblo-style architecture, and settlement distributions centered around reliable
water sources (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The Late Prehistoric throughout much of the eastern
Trans-Pecos (excluding the La Junta District) is an extension of the Late Archaic. Considering the
adaptations adopted in the western segment of the region during the Formative period, most were
largely ignored in the east. The utilization of the bow-and-arrow was the one of the few exceptions. Late Archaic-type sites dominate the landscape in the east and include ring middens, hearths,
wickiups, tipi rings, as well as the use of rockshelters. Rock art is commonly depicted on shelters
walls (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Historic Culture History
Winkler County
Some of the first people to occupy the territory now known as Winkler County were the Anasazi
Indians ca. A.D. 900 (Smith 2016). The Apache soon followed, creating a trail from Monument
Springs in New Mexico to Shafter Lake, and the Comanche settled in the White Sandhills and Blue
Mountain area by the 1870âs. The shallow water table and interdunal ponds provided an easily
accessible water source for these tribes and encouraged their continued presence. By 1859, the US
military began occupying the county seeking a wagon route to California, and in 1852, Captain
John Pope surveyed the 32nd parallel (the Texas-New Mexico border) for possible railroad construction. By 1875, Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie launched a campaign to remove the Comanche from
Winkler County and the following year, Winkler County was officially opened for white settlement, as the threat of Comanche attack had been eliminated. Five years later, the Texas and Pacific
Railway was constructed south of Winkler in Ward County, bringing reliable transportation to
Winkler and encouraging a new industryâopen range ranching (Smith 2016).
In 1887, territory was culled from Tom Green County to form Winkler County and named after
Confederate Col. Clinton M. Winkler. Over the next 23 years, the population of Winkler County
increased when the government offered a âschool landsâ credit where four sections of land were
given to be used for the construction of a single school house, and the opportunity to gain land
was too good to pass up. The number of ranches and farms also increased, although small hay and
22

Intensive Archaeological Survey of
19 Miles of the Liberty to Wink Pipeline Project, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas

corn were the only crops harvested. Droughts came in 1916 and lasted for 10 years, shrinking the
population until oil was discovered by Roy Westbrook and Company in 1926 (Smith 2016).
The oil discovery increased the population yet again, establishing the town of Wink. This boom
caused food and housing shortages, which resulted in ephemeral towns and makeshift housing
that disappeared by 1929. In the 1950s, livestock production dominated agriculture and by 1969,
the value of livestock reached $1.25 million. The US census report listed a diverse population
totaling 13,652 residents, an all-time high for Winkler County. Over the next few decades, the oil
industry fluctuated, as did the population. Oil and ranching continued to be the top industries in
Winkler County, as is the case today, with most of the population residing in Kermit, the county
seat, or Wink.
Ward County
Ward County is located just north of the Pecos River, with the river serving as its southern border.
In 1887, the county was named after Thomas W. Ward, who earned the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Texas army and fought for Texas independence. He served in numerous government
positions for Texas and the Unites States including Mayor of Austin, the U.S. consul to Panama,
and was the second commissioner of the General Land Office. Ward never lived in the county of
his namesake. It was an honorary gift to commemorate his public service upon his death in 1872
(Humphrey 2018).
Among the Native peoples to have occupied or traveled through what is now Ward County are the
Jumano, the Apache, and the Comanche. Various lithic tools and beads have been recovered from
the sand hills near present day Monahans, Texas, where the Comanche frequented a reliable water
source. Encounters between these native peoples and early Spanish explorers were mentioned by
Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and Antonio de Espejo. The latter referred to the Jumano as âthe cow
nationâ in other texts (Justice and Leffler 2019).
In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway was constructed to travel through what is now Ward
County. The railway established train stations at Sand Hills, Monahans, Aroya, Pyote, Quito,
Quito Quarry, and Barstow. However, this was not enough to encourage new settlement in the
new county. By 1890, the population only included 75 residents. In 1892, the county was officially
organized with a newly constructed courthouse and Barstow named the county seat. By the turn of
the century, the U.S. census showed an economy revolving around the ranching industry including
1,451 residents and 167 farms and ranches encompassing 424,000 acres. Vineyards and orchards
emerged in Barstow utilizing the Pecos River for irrigation. Despite flood events and droughts, the
population of Ward County continued to increase and by 1920, Ward County accounted for 10,000
acres of cotton crop, 238 farms and ranches, and a population of 2,615 (Justice and Leffler 2019).
The 1920s continued to bring prosperity to the county. Hendrick Oilfield opened in 1926 and discovered oil in 1929 in Grandfalls, Texas. That same year, pipelines and railroad loading tanks were
constructed in Wickett, Pyote, and Monahans, and the town of Royalty was established to help
23

PaleoWest Archaeology

meet the demands of the rising population. As time progressed, county infrastructure developed
in the form of railroads and state highways, which assisted with the increased demand of the oil
and railroad industries. Monahans soon became the epicenter for economic growth as the oil, gas,
potash, and sodium sulfate industries developed. In 1938 Ward County had produced 9,720,000
barrels of crude oil, and by 1940, the population had risen to 9,575 residents and the county had
renamed Monahans the new county seat.
During World War II, Pyote saw an increase in population as well, as the Pyote Army Air Field
was established, and served as a bombardment crew training base. The base included five large
hangars, shops, warehouses, and living quarters, which were occupied by more than 6,500 troops
and civilian technicians in October of 1944. The Pyote Army Air Field was the largest bomber
installment in the country and was recognized for turning unskilled troops into effective bomber
crews (Colwell 2010).
In 1957, Ward County opened the Monahans Sandhills State Historic Park, which added tourist
revenues to the economic growth. By 1960, Ward County produced 22,235,000 barrels of crude
oil and reported a population of 14,917 residents. By 1982, Ward County reported 88 percent of
the land was being utilized for farms and ranches. Of that 88 percent, only 1 percent of the land
yielded crops, with cattle ranching being the main source of revenue in this industry. In 2014,
Ward County reported a diverse population of 11,625 residents living mostly in Monahans, which
hosts a number of seasonal events including fairs, parades, and pageants (Justice and Leffler 2019).

CHAPTER 5. PROJECT AREA NATURAL SETTING
The project area is located in the Trans-Pecos ecoregion and the Toyah Basin physical region
of Texas. The Toyah Basin is the remnant of a Quaternary-aged seabed and generally consists
of flat to gently sloping topography (TPWD 2018; TSHA 2018; USDA 2015). The surrounding
ecoregion is that of the Chihuahuan basins and playas, and consists of drought-tolerant vegetation
such as creosote bush, tarbush, blackbrush, and cacti. Lower elevations in the Trans-Pecos region
represent the hottest and most arid conditions in Texas and receive no more than 12 inches of
rainfall annually, most of which falls during July, August, and September (Griffith et al. 2004).
Geology, Soils, and Pedogenesis
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, the project area is dominated mostly by windblown
sand and silt (denoted as Qs on the map) with frequent inclusions of Quaternary-aged caliche that
has been stripped of covering material (Qcc). As the project area moves farther south towards the
Pecos River, alluvium deposits (Qal) appear (USGS 1976, 2019a, 2019b).
Several different soil series are represented in the project area. These include the Wickett-SharvanaPyote series, the Wickett-Simona-Sharvana-Delnorte series, and the Reeves-Holloman-Gypsum
Land series. In the vicinity of University lands, the sediments are shallow eolian deposits of sandy
loam that tend to form over calcareous beds. These soils are generally found on flat to gently
sloping topography on uplands, mesa tops, and low ridges. These landforms represent most of the
project area and exhibit shallow, if any, Holocene-age sediments, likely eolian, overlying ancient
strata. These are a mix of primarily ancient surfaces (Pleistocene or older) and younger, shallow
Holocene-age deposits with a moderate to low potential for intact surface sites and especially for
buried archaeological sites (USDA 2015; USGS 2019a, 2019b).
Hydrology
Hydrology resources near the project area include a series of small lakes, which lie approximately
2.5 miles southwest of the pipeline corridor, flanking IH-20. These include The Lake, China Lake,
and Horseshoe Lake. Additionally, the Pecos River and its associated tributaries are approximately 7
miles southwest of the pipeline terminus at IH-20, and serve as the southern border of Ward County.
No other hydrology resources are located in the vicinity of the current project (USGS 2019).
Current State and Disturbances
The most significant disturbance in the area is from the oil and gas industry including existing
subsurface pipelines and maintained rights-of-way. These previously buried pipelines overlap or
lie adjacent to most of the current pipeline corridor and were documented in the field by PaleoWest
archaeologists.

CHAPTER 6. SURVEY METHODS
Archaeology survey on University of Texas lands consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian archaeological survey conducted on three transects spaced 30 m apart within the 300-foot survey corridor.
STs were conducted according the CTA guidelines for linear surveys at 16 tests per mile per survey transect (approximately one test every 100 m).
Within the above framework, and per CTA guidelines, pedestrian survey and/or shovel testing
was not conducted in areas of exposed bedrock, in areas with greater than 30 percent ground
surface visibility in upland or erosional settings, on slopes greater than 20 percent, or in settings
with evidence of significant ground disturbance. STs were not conducted in heavily disturbed and
unsafe areas such as existing, maintained, buried pipeline rights-of-way. Disturbed areas, active
crop lands, and disturbed oil field areas were subject to limited field observation, documentation
of disturbance, and judgmental shovel testing.
Any identified archaeological sites were assessed at the survey level of effort for eligibility as an
SAL. A minimum of six STs were placed in all archaeological sites per THC survey standards.
Sufficient STs were placed to satisfy THC minimum survey standards and to assess site boundaries,
content, and context. Any identified archaeological sites, historic features, or artifact concentrations
were recorded, photographed, and mapped using a GPS unit with submeter accuracy, all diagnostic
artifacts were collected for further study. Limited archival and historical research was conducted to
determine the historical importance of any discovered historic-age archaeological sites.
Two types of data were collected on the handheld Trimble GPS units: 1) ST locations and 2)
observed test locations (OTLs). Prior to the survey, a grid of pre-plotted ST locations at 16 STs
per mile per 100-foot width, on three pedestrian transects, were uploaded into the Trimbles. Crews
followed along on transects to the pre-plotted locations to excavate STs. OTLs represent pre-plotted locations that could not be excavated due to ground conditions (disturbance, rock, etc.), or
locations that exhibited no Holocene soils and good ground surface visibility, or which represented
the existing buried pipeline. OTLs were collected as a secondary line of mapping data in support
of negative ST distributions, which also indicate no cultural materials present. Site and ST information was entered on iPads for efficient collection, transmission, and maintenance of the digital
data. The termination depth and reason for termination was recorded for all STs.
During this intensive survey with good ground surface visibility, archaeologists conducting the
100 percent pedestrian survey and following the pre-plotted ST grid, were also responsible for and
highly encouraged to place judgmental STs in areas that retained the potential for buried deposits
(e.g., dunes, playa margins, alluvial fans) based on their survey training and experience. Thus,
systematic coverage was obtained using a combination of the pre-plotted ST grid and judgmental
shovel testing in high probability areas in this desert terrain. Unfortunately, oil lease and grazing
activity for generations has resulted in few high probability areas remaining on these University
of Texas lands.

CHAPTER 7. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY NARRATIVE AND SITE 41WK131
The pedestrian survey was conducted from May 23â28, 2019, by three PaleoWest staff, led by
project archaeologist Jeremy Loven, and ably assisted by Ben Shirar and Scott Cole. Principal
Investigator James Karbula was on site during the initial field investigations to ensure that the
TAC permit methods were carefully followed and to observe project conditions. From the beginning of the survey, it was evident that an existing buried pipeline with a cleared, well-maintained
right-of-way significantly overlapped the survey corridor, running adjacent to or down the center
of the proposed new line for much of the length of the project. This was especially the case at the
north end of the proposed pipeline. At the north end, when the existing line overlapped two of the
proposed survey transects, one additional pedestrian transect was placed as an offset to expand the
survey corridor for additional project coverage, and to provide Salt Creek with additional flexibility in line placement. From IH 20 to the northern project terminus (MP 21.1â39), a total of 670
negative STs were excavated, and 131 OTLs were mapped and recorded (see Figures 2â5). One
archaeological site (41WK131) was recorded, adjacent to and overlapping the east edge of the survey corridor at approximately MP 37 (see Figures 2, 6, and 7). The site consists of a historic-age
corral and artifact scatter. There are no residential or other cultural features and no buried deposits.
The artifact scatter was low density and confined to the surface. Four potentially diagnostic bottles
were collected and returned to the PaleoWest laboratory for analysis. The site, artifacts, and related
archival research are described in detail below.
41WK131
Site Type: Historic, structural
Cultural and Temporal Affiliation: Historic period (A.D. 1923â1963)
Dimensions/Area: 91 m Ã 121 m (8,860 m2)
NRHP Eligibility Status: Not eligible
Site 41WK131 was newly identified during the current investigation and documented as a historic-era
sheep corral with an associated artifact scatter encompassed within a 91-m by 121-m (8,860 m2) area.
The site is on University of Texas land approximately 6.7 km southwest of Wink, Texas, and is
accessible via two-track roads and pipeline corridors. The far western portion of the site boundary
overlaps the current survey corridor, while the central and eastern portions of the site, including the
corral and most artifacts, are outside (east) of the survey corridor. At the nearest extent, the corral is
within 6 m of the survey corridorâs eastern boundary (see Figures 2, 6, and 7).
Environmental Setting and Surface Characteristics
The site is located in an area characterized by predominantly level terrain covered by a shallow
sandsheet, with some early-stage coppice dune formation. Vegetation observed within the site

boundary is moderate in density and includes mesquite, a variety of grasses and forbs, desert
sumac, and soaptree yucca. Surface visibility is greater than 50 percent and observed surface
sediments consist of light brown sand and loamy sand. The site is in an area heavily modified by
oil and gas development activity, but appears to be mostly unaffected by the activity. A two-track
road runs along the northeast section of the corral, but has not damaged the structure. Impacts
to the site caused by erosional processes also have been minimal. Despite these impacts, the site
retains moderate integrity and is at least 50 percent intact.
Features and Artifact Assemblage
Two features and a low-density artifact scatter were documented within the site boundary. Feature
1 is a sheep corral constructed of wooden posts and planks and metal fencing (Photo 1). The corral
consists of three contiguous holding pens accessible through internal and/or external gates and a
wooden chute (Photo 2). The area encompassed by the holding pens measures 30 m by 30 m (746
m2). The maximum dimensions of the chute are 12 m by 8 m. The structure is partially dilapidated
and in the process of collapse. Feature 2 is a pile of 20 weathered wooden posts and a few strands
of rusted barbed wire placed along the northeast portion of the corral (Photo 3).

The artifact assemblage is composed of four amber-colored vaccine bottles (100 CC/100 ml), dozens of amber glass fragments, one sanitary can, one spark plug, and dozens of miscellaneous metal
fragments (Table 2). The vaccine bottles (Photo 4) resemble the glass bottles used by the O. M.
Franklin Serum Company during the early to mid-20th century. The four bottles recovered from
the corral bear an Owens-Illinois makerâs mark on the base (an I-in-an-O). This makerâs mark
began circulation in 1954 and is still used by the company today (Lockhart et al. 2019).
However, historic aerial photos of the site, taken on May 5, 1954, do not show the corral. The corral
first appears in USGS Earth Explorer single frame aerial imagery on an image dated February 11,
1967 (Entity No. AR1VBQL00020069) (USGS 2019c; Photo 5). The corral appears to be in the
south central region of the photo, just southeast of an oil well pad. Because these two images (1954
and 1967) are the only two available from this source, the age of the corral is thought to be no older
than 65 years. No other historic aerial images were found.

Subsurface Investigations
In an attempt to investigate the potential for buried cultural deposits and examine the geomorphological
integrity at 41WK131, six STs were excavated within the site boundary (Table 3). All STs were
negative for cultural remains and exposed generally shallow deposits of light brown loamy sand
overlying a pre-cultural horizon with extensive calcium carbonate development. Based on the results
of the subsurface investigations, the site retains geomorphic integrity, but the absence of cultural
remains in any of the STs suggests that the potential for subsurface cultural deposits is minimal.

Site Summary and NRHP and SAL Eligibility Recommendation
Site 41WK131 consists of a historic-era sheep corral with associated artifacts. There are no
residential features or evidence of a residential occupation. The site has been assigned a historicperiod (A.D. 1923â1963) temporal affiliation due to the presence of diagnostic artifacts. Based on
the results of the current investigation, site 41WK131 does not meet the eligibility requirements
established under any criterion of 36 CFR 60.4 or the Antiquities Code of Texas. Consequently,
PaleoWest recommends the site as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or as an SAL.
Research was conducted at the Winkler County courthouse in Kermit, Texas, to determine land
ownership of the corral. Records at the courthouse were organized by current landowner and not
legal description and little information was available. After a discussion with the University of
Texas Easements and Commercial Leases representatives from the Midland office of University
Lands Representatives, it was determined that the State acquired ownership of the lands from
Mexico in 1836, and that these University Lands never left the sovereign of the State. The current
project area is part of over 2.1 million acres that were awarded to the University of Texas as
Permanent University Fund (PUF) lands in the mid to late 1800s. There is no association of the
corral site with any specific person or owner other than the university. It is unknown how many
ranchers may have grazed that area, and whether they had any permits or leases to do so.
Under the National Register Criteria for evaluation, the quality of significance in American
history, architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
The historic-age cultural remains documented at site 41WK131 cannot be associated with
significant events or persons due to the vague temporal affiliation and lack of any direct connection
to an owner or specific person or entity (Criteria A, B). The standing historic-age features at the
site are not distinctive, or sufficiently well-preserved to represent significant characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction, or artistic value, or work of a master (Criterion C). No
residential structures or domestic features other than the corral are present that might indicate
a residential location, and no unique or significant artifacts or artifact collection are present.
Therefore, the site is not significant under Criterion D.

CHAPTER 8. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Paleowest conducted archival research, agency coordination, a 100 percent pedestrian survey and
extensive shovel testing of approximately 19 miles for the proposed Liberty to Wink pipeline
project across a 300-foot survey corridor (approximately 702 acres) in Ward and Winkler Counties,
Texas. The entirety of the proposed pipeline right-of-way is owned by the University Lands of the
University of Texas system. The project was conducted consistent with the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT, Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resource Code), the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Code (Title 13, Chapter 26 of the Texas Administrative Code
[13 TAC 26]), and under TAC Permit 8919.
One archaeological site (41WK131) was recorded on University of Texas oil lease lands, adjacent
to and overlapping the east edge of the survey corridor in Winkler County, Texas. Site 41WK131 is
recommended as not eligible as an SAL or for listing in the NRHP and for no further archaeological
investigations.
An interim letter summary report of these investigations was submitted to the THC on July 8,
2019. The letter requested concurrence with the recommendation for site 41WK131. The interim
letter requested concurrence that sufficient information was presented in the interim report for the
THC to grant permission for the 19-mile proposed pipeline project to proceed with regard to the
Antiquities Code of Texas. This request was based on the premise that a full report of investigations
and professional curation would follow to complete TAC Permit 8919. In a response dated August
6, 2019, the THC concurred with the information provided in the interim report, and that site
41WK131 is not eligible for designation as an SAL.
This final report is presented in partial completion of TAC Permit 8919 with professional curation
to follow of all project-related materials at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, to complete the TAC permit.
