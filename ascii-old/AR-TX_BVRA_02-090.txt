INTRODUCTION
An archaeological survey of approximately 60 acres at the site of the
proposed Polk County Landfill Expansion project in central Polk County, Texas
(Figure 1) was conducted on July 5-6, 2001 by BVRA under antiquities permit
2636 issued by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission. The field
crew consisted of William E. Moore, James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist)
and two Field Assistants (Art Romine and Tom McMasters). The project area is
depicted on the 7.5' topographic quadrangle New Willard, Texas dated 1984
(Figure 2), and the project area showing the approximate location of shovel tests
and disturbed areas appears as Figure 3.
Prior to entering the field, a records check was made at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to identify all previously
recorded sites, if any, in the project area and vicinity. No sites were found to be
present within the project area. Significant archaeological sites are known to
occur in the general area, specifically along Kickapoo Creek (now under Lake
Livingston) and its tributaries to the south. Based on this records check and
personal experience in the area by the Principal Investigator it appeared that
there was a chance for the occurrence of archaeological sites in the project area.
This assumption was strengthened by the presence of sandy uplands
overlooking a tributary of Barnett Creek to the north. Based on the potential for
archaeological sites in the project area Polk County retained BVRA to conduct a
cultural resources survey. The project number assigned by BVRA is 01-12.

FIELD METHODS
The Phase I survey was conducted utilizing the pedestrian survey method
supported by shovel testing. During the field survey, the entire project area was
examined for surface and subsurface evidence of archaeological sites with
emphasis on those areas believed to be high probability for site occurrence.
Virtually all of the project area had been cleared by logging; therefore, the
surface exposure was excellent. In addition to land clearing, a borrow area, a dirt
stockpile, a large area which had been disturbed to clay, and an artificial ditch
were observed. These areas along with the approximate location of shovel tests
are depicted on Figure 3.
The entire tract was walked by the survey crew in transects at 30 meter
intervals; however, shovel tests were restricted to the areas not disturbed. All
earth excavated during shovel testing was screened through 1/4 inch hardware
cloth. In all, 32 shovel tests were dug throughout the project area (Appendix I).
Each shovel test was 30 x 50 cm in size and was dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels. A
backhoe was not considered necessary due to the lack of a floodplain in the
project area.
No engineering map was provided by Polk County. Therefore, a field map
was made (not to scale) with all locations of tests and disturbed areas shown as
approximations. In addition to the topographic quadrangle, the soils book for
Polk and San Jacinto counties was consulted during the survey (McEwen, et al.
1988). Figure 4 depicts the project area superimposed on the soils map.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in a county that contains significant
archaeological sites, both prehistoric and historic. A file search conducted at
TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no previously recorded sites in the project area.
Several sites have been reported south of the area along Lake Livingston. No
sites in the vicinity are listed in the National Register of Historic Places 1993
update or as State Archeological Landmarks. There is, however, a State
Archeological Landmark referred to the Lake Livingston Recreation Area to the
south of the current project area, but it appears that only one site (41PK21) may
be included.
According to a planning document prepared by the Department of
Antiquities Protection (now the Archeology Division), the project area is located in
the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2). At the time this document was
prepared Polk County contained 0.001 to 0.1 sites per square mile. This is the
lowest recorded site density of any county in Texas except for two counties with
no recorded sites.
The three archeological regions in the Eastern Planning Region exhibit
greater internal environmental homogeneity than does the planning region as a
whole and is characterized by considerable cultural diversity, both through time
and space (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:13). Early cultures in the region exhibit
a greater degree of similarity in lifeways than was the case for later cultures.
These early groups were probably hunters and gatherers utilizing site areas for
brief periods based on the widespread distribution of point styles, the frequent
occurrence of exotic raw materials, and the meagerness of occupational debris
found at excavated campsites (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:13-14). Through
time, group territories appear to have been reduced, perhaps due to increased
population. As territoriality of groups increased, greater internal diversity is
evidenced in the archeological record of the region (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:14). The diversity in the archeological record becomes quite pronounced
by the Late Prehistoric period, enabling researchers to distinguish the Late
Prehistoric from earlier periods. The discussion above was taken largely from the
planning document by the Department of Antiquities Protection.
Much of our current knowledge of the prehistory and history of Polk
County has resulted from cultural resource studies, primarily involving Lake
Livingston. The first major project to involve the reservoir area was the initial
survey (Nunley 1963), testing (McClurkan 1967), and mitigation (McClurkan
1968) of the proposed lake area by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(TASP) in the 1960s. Since that time a number of small projects have been
conducted. Typically, these are small area surveys by private contractors
working with the Corps of Engineers (COE) or in-house projects by COE staff.

Since the TASP investigations in the 1960s, only one major excavation
project has been conducted in the county. The Crawford site (41PK69) was
excavated by the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University,
under the direction of H. Blaine Ensor and David L. Carlson (1988) in 1984-1985.
Their work provided evidence that deeply stratified upland sites exist within the
region. The Crawford site was determined to have been inhabited during much
of the Holocene as Early, Middle, and Late Archaic occupations, as well as Early
and Late Ceramic Period components, were defined. The data suggest that the
latest deposits are Caddo related, and some occupational debris may be
attributed to the historic Bidai (Ensor and Carlson 1988:iii). The interested
researcher is advised to consult the above-mentioned sources for previous work
in Polk County.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A 100% pedestrian survey of the 60 acre project area did not locate any
archaeological sites. The project area consists of uplands adjacent to a tributary
of Barnett Creek to the north. Two small tributaries, probably erosional gullies,
enter the project area from this tributary. The area contains sandy soils
consisting of two types, Woodville fine sandy loam, 1 to 5% slopes (WoB) and
Woodville fine sandy loam, 5 to 12% slopes (WoD) (McEwen et al. 1988:Sheet
28). The WoD soils are found along the gullies, while the WoB soils comprise
the remainder of the project area. The WoB soils are a gently sloping soil found
on convex upland slopes. Typically, the surface layer is a fine sandy loam to a
depth of about six inches, below which is clay subsoil to depth of 70 inches
(McEwen et al. 1988:51-52). The WoD soils, found strictly along the creek, are a
sloping to strongly sloping soil on convex side slopes on uplands. Typically, the
surface layer is a brown fine sandy loam about five inches thick with mottled
brown and red clay subsoil to depth of 65 inches (McEwen et al. 1988:52).
Shovel testing revealed a shallow fine sandy loam throughout most of the project
area. In some areas, however, the shallow soils were the result of scraping of
the original land surface by heavy machinery.
Those areas believed to be the least disturbed received the most attention
in terms of shovel testing. A relatively undisturbed hill in the northwest corner of
the project area was examined by digging 14 shovel tests. The soil depth was
found to be very shallow with depths (fine sandy loam to clay) varying from 5 to
25 cm. This does not appear to be a suitable location for a significant prehistoric
site. It was estimated by the survey crew that 20 acres within the project area
were undisturbed at the time of the survey, 30 acres were disturbed, and 10
acres were associated with the active borrow pit.
It is the opinion of BVRA that no significant archaeological sites are
present within the project area, and it is recommended that Polk County be
allowed to proceed with development as planned. It is always possible that
cultural resources are missed during any archaeological survey. Should,
however, evidence of a site be encountered during construction all work should
cease until a decision can be made by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission in consultation with representatives of Polk County and Brazos
Valley Research Associates.
