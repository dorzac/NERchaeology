ABSTRACT

Raba-Kistner Consultants, Inc. (R-K) performed an intensive cultural resources survey on
approximately 27 total miles (65 total acres) of the proposed Sand Hills Pressure Zone (SHPZ)
water distribution system located in eastern El Paso County, Texas. The intensive survey was
conducted to ensure compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The cultural resources survey of the project area
consisted of visual inspection of the ground surface for cultural materials. Work was performed on
July 6 and July 7, 2010 under Antiquities Permit Number 5673.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the recording of one new site, 41EP6622, consisting of
four burned caliche scatters found on the ground surface and located in close proximity to each
other. No artifacts were found in the area of the caliche scatters. The site is not considered
significant and no additional work is recommended. No additional cultural resources were
identified on the ground surface during the investigation. Based on the paucity of observed and
recovered cultural materials, it is unlikely that significant cultural resources will be impacted by
the proposed project. Cultural resources clearance is recommended for the project.

INTRODUCTION

On behalf of the Lower Valley Water District (LVWD), CSA Engineers, Inc. contracted with
Raba-Kistner Consultants, Inc. (R-K) to perform an intensive cultural resources survey on
approximately 27 total miles and on 7.79 total acres for a proposed water distribution system
that is situated in rural El Paso County, located southeast of the city limits of Horizon City and
partly within the community of Agua Dulce. The Sand Hills Pressure Zone (SHPZ) is located
adjacent northeast of Interstate Highway 10 (IH-10). A Project Location Map is included as
Figure 1.
The Lower Valley Water District (LVWD) is a municipal utility district formed in 1986 that
currently provides potable water to the communities of San Elizario, Socorro, Clint and Horizon
City, Texas. The LVWD proposes to construct new water supply infrastructure that will provide
domestic potable water connections to 368 standard residences in communities within the
SHPZ which consists of a series of colonias (College Park, Ascension Park, Colonia Del Paso,
Darington Park, Dairyland, and Vista Larga) (Figure 2). This region typically lacks adequate
domestic and wastewater infrastructure. Residents in the region rely on potable water that is
hauled-in by truck. CSA Engineers was retained by the LVWD to design a new water
distribution system for the SHPZ.
Since the project involves federal funding sources, R-K is conducting an environmental review
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the Border Environmental
Cooperation Commission (BECC) and Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) so that we
may assess the environmental impacts for the construction of a proposed water distribution
system for the SHPZ. R-K performed a cultural resources survey of proposed water system to
ensure compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the investigation was to
determine if archeological sites are located within the project area, and if sites are present,
determine their potential eligibility for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) or
for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival and historic background review, an
100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area that entailed visual inspection of the ground
surface for cultural materials supplemented with shovel testing, and a report suitable for review
by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in accordance with the THCâs Rules of Practice and
Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologistsâ (CTA) Guidelines
for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Pollyanna Clark, Archaeologist was the Principal
Investigator for the project and Chris Murray, Archaeologist and Brian Strye, Environmental
Professional performed the cultural resources survey on July 6 and July 7, 2010. The work
entailed surface inspection for cultural materials, shovel testing, and scraping of profile
cutbacks. The high ground surface visibility precluded the need for shovel testing. Work was
performed under Antiquities Permit Number 5673.
The APE consists of approximately 144,100 linear feet (27 total miles) of the proposed waterline
route in addition to 5.31 acres for the Sand Hills Tank site and chlorination facilities and 2.48
acres at the Mitchell Tanks site where the proposed Mitchell Tank #3 will be built. An estimate
of depth of the project ranges from six to 11 feet. The width of the survey corridor is
approximately 20 feet (6 meters). The total acres surveyed consisted of approximately 65
acres. A map of the project site plotted on the Clint NW (3106-413), Clint NE (3106-414), Clint

(3106-412), and Clint SE (3106 411) USGS 7.5 minute United States Geological Survey
(USGS) topographic quadrangles is presented as Figure 3.
Approximately half of the APE has been previously surveyed for cultural resources resulting in
negative findings: Eleven of the 27 total miles as well as the 5.31 acres for the Sand Hills Tank
site and chlorination facilities within the APE were previously surveyed for cultural resources by
R-K in 2005.
The entire APE provided surface visibility sufficient to allow for detailed surface inspection.
Visibility ranged between 95 and 100 percent. The background study and previous work in the
area in 2005, revealed that all of previously recorded sites found within a one mile radius of the
project area had been identified from artifacts visible on the ground surface with little, if any,
depth of cultural deposits. The coppice dunal terrain and disturbance of the project area
generally precluded the need for subsurface probing (shovel testing or trenching). Most cultural
remains were exposed on the surface in areas where the soils have undergone deflation.
R-K excavated a total of three shovel tests and cleaned the profile of one cutback. The survey
resulted in the recording of one new site, 41EP6622, consisting of four, disarticulated and
deflated, burned caliche scatters found on the surface next to coppice dunes. No artifacts were
found in the area of the caliche scatters. The site is not considered significant and no further
work is recommended. No additional cultural materials, artifacts, or features were identified
during the survey. No further work is recommended and R-K recommends that LVWD proceed
with construction activities as planned.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

A.

Project Area Setting

The Sand Hills project area falls within the Hueco Bolson and is flanked by the Hueco
Mountains to the east, the Franklin Mountains toward the west, and the Sierra Juarez and Rio
Grande River to the south. Views of the project area are presented in Appendix A - Photos 1
through 6.
The Sand Hills project area is located in the Chihuahua Desert. Since prehistoric times
obtaining water in this region has been a problem. Landscape features that are often mistaken
for playas may yield water beneath the surface for some months following a heavy rainfall.
Subsurface or even transient sources have been critical to the inhabitants through time.
Modern use of the area may have dramatically lowered the water table. With a minor increase
in the amount of annual precipitation, standing water deposited in fault line depressions may
have collected for a longer period of time.
Inconclusive results from woodrat midden, faunal, and pollen studies fail to provide an accurate
model of the regionâs Paleoclimate or Paleoenvironmental trends. It is possible that Late
Holocene vegetation remained unchanged from the mid-Holocene to the present; however,
others disagree. Monger (1992) and Von Finger et al. (1992) argue that desert scrub, especially
mesquite, was widespread in the Hueco Bolson beginning from 7,000 B.P. and has persisted
until present. Gile and Hawley (1968) believe that the region consisted of desert grassland until
the grazing of domesticated animals in historic times disturbed the ground surface sufficiently
enough to cause the proliferation of desert scrub vegetation. Conclusions derived from
prehistoric charcoal analyses substantiate Monger and Von Fingerâs argument that mesquite

was the dominant form of vegetation and the preferred fuel for the areasâ inhabitants dating from
690 Â± 70 to 3800 Â± 60 years B.P.(OâLaughlin from Mauldin, Graves, and Bentley 1994).
Monger (1992) states that prehistoric materials may be connected with Organ II surfaces and
historic deposits may possess intact archaeological deposits. Mongerâs (1992) general
Holocene stratigraphy consists of:
1.)
2.)
3.)
4.)
5.)

Historic blows and with stratified eolian sediments dating 1850 A.D. to the present.
Organ III has no eolian strata, no carbonate filaments 100 to 1100 B.P.
Organ II is strata with faint Stage I caliche filaments 1100 to 21000 B.P.
Organ I has prominent Stage I filaments, 5 year hues, and Faint Clay Skins 2100 to
7000 B.P.
Lastly, the La Mesa indurated caliche strata.

Hydrology
The historic period may have caused a drop in the water table. In prehistoric times water may
have been more abundant when there was increase in precipitation and subsequently remained
standing for a longer time than is observed today. If not for the possibility of a more accessible
supply of ground or standing water in prehistoric times, inhabitants in the area would not have
been able to survive. Except for the existence of water in the nearby fault line depressions, the
nearest permanent water sources are the Rio Grande River to the south and the Hueco Tanks
in the northeast part of the county.
B.

Flora and Fauna

Flora
The natural vegetation in the project area is typical of the Chihuahuan Desert and El Paso
regions. According to the Texas Parks & Wildlife Departmentâs (TPWD) Vegetation Types of
Texas, the project site is found in âMesquite-sandsage shrub.â Common species include
Fourwing Saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Palmella (Yucca elata), Mormon tea (Ephedra
torreyana), Sotol (Dasylirion), Sand dropseed (Sporobolus Dryptandrus), Blue grama
(Bouteloua gracilis), Black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia
sarothrae), and Devils claw (Acacia neovernicosa).
Results of field visits conducted on July 6, 2010 and July 7, 2010 indicate that the project site is
consistent with the âMesquite-sandsage shrubâ designation. Results of vegetative sampling
indicated the following predominant vegetation types (tree, shrub, and herb layers): creosote
bush (Larrea tridentata), four-wing salt bush (Atriplex canescens), mesquite (Prosopis sp.),
broom snake weed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), woolly croton (Croton capitatus), and gramma grass
(Bouteloua sp.).
Fauna
In 1950, author W. F. Blair published the Biotic Provinces of Texas in the Journal of Science.
According to this publication, the project is located in the Chihuahuan Province. According to
Blair, approximately 83 species of mammals have been recorded to have lived in the
Chihuahuan Desert region of Texas. Many of the mammals of this province are species
characteristic of the Mexican tablelands and southwestern deserts. Fourteen species are limited

in Texas to the Chihuahuan province. These include: Mexican Long-nosed Bat (Leptonycteris
nivalis), Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis), long-legged myotis (Myotis volans), Small-footed
Myotis (Myotis subulatus), fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes), Western Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus
Hesperus), Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida macrotis), Western Mastiff Bat (Eumops perotis), Hooded
Skunk (Mephitis macroura), Desert Pocket Gopher (Geomys arenarius), Yellow-nosed Cotton
Rat (Sigmodon ochrognathus), Nelsonâs pocket mouse (Perognathus nelsoni), Merriam's
Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys merriami), and the now the locally extinct Grizzly Bear (Ursus
horribilis) (Blair 1950).
C.

Soils

The surface soils are described in detail by Jaco (1971) as types within the Hueco-Wink
Association. The ground surface of the survey area consists by and large of eolian sands
overlying sandy loam torripsament soils that cover caliche until encountering bedrock
associated with the Hueco Mountains. Core samples dug by the El Paso Water Company
supply a detailed description of the bedrock. The core samples provide data on ground water
availability at depths beneath the surface from the historic to the modern period. This data may
shed some insight in our understanding of prehistoric surface water availability (Peterson &
Willis 2000). A soils map is included as Figure 4.

METHODS

A.

Archival Research Methods

Background research included accessing the THCâs online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) as well as a review of survey reports, site files, and maps on file at the THC and Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) (THC 2010). These resources were examined in
order to identify previously recorded sites and past investigations within the vicinity of the project
area. The aerial photo, USGS 7.5 minute quad map, geologic map, and USDA soil survey
maps were also examined prior to the field investigation. These supplemented the background
research and helped provide information on topography, soils, vegetation, geology, the local
environment, and levels of development in and around the project area.
B.

Field Methods

The intensive survey included a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the APE in areas not
previously surveyed for cultural resources. The width of the APE was 6 meters (20 feet) and the
length of the APE was approximately 27 miles. Approximately 11 miles as well as 5.31 acres
for the Sand Hills Tank site and chlorination facilities had been previously surveyed for cultural
resources in 2005. Thus, the 2010 survey area consisted of 16 miles of proposed alignment not
previously surveyed for cultural resources and the 2.48 acres for the Mitchell Tank #3. Total
acres surveyed consisted of 65 acres. The ground surface was carefully inspected for cultural
resources while traversing the path of the proposed water system in parallel north/south or
east/west transects. The APE was documented. All work complied with THC and Council of
Texas Archaeologists (CTA) survey standards for the overall project area unless documented
field conditions warranted otherwise.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards requires a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects. Since all previously recorded sites within the project vicinity
had been initially identified from surficial artifact scatters and features, R-K deviated from the
Proposed Water Supply Infrastructure

survey standards by not excavating 16 shovel tests per mile. R-K visually inspected the ground
surface for artifacts, features, or other cultural materials. When artifacts were identified on the
surface, shovel tests were then dug to determine the depth of deposits, if any. Newly
discovered prehistoric and historic archeological sites were defined in compliance with
THC/CTA survey standards and policies including requirements for assessing historical sites
and cemeteries.
Field notes were maintained and included information pertaining to terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, and cultural material observed. Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms will include location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as
appropriate. The locations of all trenches, shovel tests, and profile cuts were recorded via
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) map datum. Newly
discovered prehistoric and historic archeological sites were defined in compliance with
THC/CTA survey standards and policies including requirements for assessing historical sites
and cemeteries.
This survey set out to employ a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Non-diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass) were described, sketched, and/or
photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in which they were found. In
the event that diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, marked historic materials)
were identified in the field, they were to be collected and placed in plastic bags labeled with
relevant provenience information. Non-diagnostic artifacts were photo-documented in the field.
Since no diagnostic artifacts were encountered in the survey, the proposed collection policy was
not implemented.

RESULTS

A.

Results of Archival Research

The results of the background research determined that portions of the water system had been
previously surveyed for cultural resources. In 2005 R-K performed a 100 percent pedestrian
survey for the originally-proposed water system that covered a total length of 11 miles as well as
the 5.31-acre tract in the northeast corner of the project area for the proposed Sand Hills Tank
Site and chlorination facilities. No cultural resources were identified during the 2005
investigation (Held and Darnell 2005).
Previous investigations in the region report that except in isolated areas of minimal deflation, for
example in mesquite coppice dunes or in areas with built-up terrain, archeological deposits
within interdunal areas have been conflated to the extent that there is a mixing of early and late
deposits rendering cultural and chronological contexts meaningless (Lynn et al 1975; Kauffman
1984; Graves and Peterson 1994; Peterson et al 2000).
No previously recorded sites are located within the APE, and few sites have been recorded
within project vicinity. The nearest recorded site, 41EP3036, is located one mile southeast of
project area (THC 2010).
Six sites were recorded during the Samalayuca Gas Pipeline Expansion Project. Four of the
sites (41EP3036, 41EP3041, 41EP3042, and 41EP3043) are located one mile to one and a half
miles southeast of the project area. All four sites are prehistoric open campsites and contain
charcoal stains and ceramic sherds (with the exception of site 41EP3042). Based on the
presence of Jornada brownware sherds, site 41EP3036 dates between AD 900 to AD 1300.
Sites 41EP3041 and 41EP3043 date between AD 900 and AD 1400 based on brownware and
Chupadera black on white sherds. Site 41EP3042 has been dated to the Archaic period based
on the lack of ceramics. Avoidance is recommended at all four of sites, but cultural significance
is limited with the exception of site 41EP3043 that has been recommended as potentially
eligible for inclusion on NRHP. Further testing of the site has been recommended if avoidance
is not possible. The other sites, 41EP5271 and 41EP5272, recorded during the Samalayuca
Gas Pipeline Expansion Project are located about one and a half miles northeast of the project
area. Both sites are also prehistoric open campsites. Site 41EP5271 contains subtle cultural
evidence and the recorder states that the siteâs potential may have been exhausted by the
survey. Site 41EP5272 possesses a high probability to contain buried cultural materials and
datable features. Further testing may yield radiocarbon dates and information regarding feature
function and occupational seasonality (THC 2010).
A second group of sites located less than one half mile south of the project area is situated near
the present-day Clint Landfill. Five sites (41EP2566, 41EP2567, 41EP2568, 41EP2569, and
41EP2570) have been recorded; however, not much information accompanies the site files.
Sites 41EP2566 and 41EP2567 have been interpreted as historic dumps dating to the 1930âs
based on the metal and glass historic artifacts and Anglo-American ceramics. The other three
sites, 41EP2568, 41EP2569, and 41EP2570 are prehistoric. Sites 41EP2568 and 41EP2570
contain prehistoric hearths, as well as, chipped stone artifacts (dart points, flakes) while site
41EP2570 also produced ceramics. Recommendations have not been made on any of these
sites. Two sites, 41EP406 and 41EP407, are located about two miles northwest of the survey
area, but no additional data has been recorded. No sites, currently listed in the NRHP or
designated as SALs occur within or immediately adjacent to the project area (THC 2010).

B.

Survey Results

R-K performed a 100 percent survey of the APE and visually inspected the ground surface for
artifacts, features, or other cultural materials. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards requires a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects. Since the
previously recorded sites within the project vicinity had been identified from surficial artifact
scatters and features, R-K deviated from the survey standards by not excavating 16 shovel
tests per mile.
The survey included the excavation of three shovel tests and the profile of a dunal cutback was
cut shovel scraped and examined for cultural materials. Each shovel test consisted of deep,
sandy soils and was excavated to 100 cmbs. No artifacts were identified in the shovel tests or in
the scraped profile. Views of the negative shovel test and cleaned profile cut are included in
Appendix A, Photos 7 and 8. Shovel test data is included in Appendix B.
One new archeological site, âSand Hills Site 1â, later recorded as trinomial 41EP6622 with
TARL, was identified during the survey. The site consists of four disarticulated, burned caliche
scatters found on the ground surface of the APE next to a coppice dune north/northwest of the
Darington Park colonia. Caliche Scatter 1 consists of approximately 50 pieces of burned caliche
spread across 36 square meters. None of the caliche fragments were larger than 20 cm.
Caliche Scatter 2 consists of 40 burned rocks, the largest one is 30 cm, and the scatter covers
six square meters. Caliche Scatter 3 consists of about 40 burned rock pieces - the largest rock
is 20 cm and covers four square meters. Caliche Scatter 4 is much larger than the others -It
consists of over a 100 pieces of burned rock and the largest piece is 40 cm and covers a 36
square meter area. Other than the burned rocks, no artifacts were found within the area of the
scatters. Views of site 41EP6622 are included in Appendix A, Photos 9 through 12. A map
showing the showing the previous surveys, shovel tests, scraped profile, and caliche scatters (site
41EP6622) is included as Figure 5. A more detailed site map of Sand Hills Site 1 (41EP6622) is
presented as Figure 6.

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

CSA Engineers, Inc. contracted with R-K to perform an intensive cultural resources survey on
approximately 27 total miles and on 7.79 total acres for the new SHPZ water distribution system
that is situated in rural El Paso County, located southeast of the city limits of Horizon City and
partly within the community of Agua Dulce. The proposed water system crosses a series of
colonias: College Park, Ascension Park, Colonia Del Paso, Darington Park, Dairyland, and Vista
Larga in El Paso County, Texas.
Results of the background study determined while that no previously recorded sites are located
within the APE, portions of the APE had been previously surveyed for cultural resources by R-K
in 2005. The nearest recorded site, 41EP3036, is located one mile southeast of project area.
No previously recorded sites currently listed in the NRHP or designated as SALs occur within or
adjacent to the project site (THC 2010). The 2005 survey area covered a total length of eleven
miles in addition to the 5.31-acre tract located in the northeast corner of the project area for the
Sand Hills Tank site and chlorination facilities. No cultural resources were identified during the
2005 survey (Held and Darnell 2005).
The project area consisted of sandy soils with between 95 and 100 percent ground surface
visibility. The survey revealed that portions of APE had been modified by clearing of mesquite
and land leveling related to the construction of the adjacent colonias and roadway construction.
The background study and previous work in the area in 2005, revealed that all of previously
recorded sites found within a one mile radius of the project area had been identified from
artifacts visible on the ground surface with little, if any, depth of cultural deposits. The coppice
dunal terrain and disturbance of the project area generally precluded the need for subsurface
probing (shovel testing or trenching). Most cultural remains were exposed on the surface in
areas where the soils have undergone deflation.
R-K performed a 100 percent survey of the APE and visually inspected the ground surface for
artifacts, features, or other cultural materials. Total acreage surveyed consisted of 65 acres.
The survey included the excavation of three shovel tests and the profile cleaning of a dunal
cutback. One new site was recorded in the survey. Sand Hills Site 1, later recorded as site
41EP6622 with TARL, consists of four burned caliche scatters, located on the ground surface
(depth of deposits was 0 cmbs) and are disarticulated and deflated. No artifacts or evidence of
soil staining were found within the area of the burned caliche scatters. Site 41EP6622 is not
considered significant or eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL and therefore, no further
work is recommended for 41EP6622.
Other than the discovery of the new site, no additional cultural materials (artifacts, features,
sites) were identified during the investigation. Based on the paucity of observed and recovered
cultural materials, it is unlikely that significant cultural resources will be impacted by the
proposed project. No further work is recommended.
The paucity of recorded sites within the Sand Hills project area may be due to lack of
accessible, sustainable water sources during prehistoric times. More suitable areas of
habitation are found to the north (Hueco Tanks area) and to the west (the Rio Grande River).
Prehistoric peoples would have found these places much more hospitable and may have only
passed through the project site.

Archeological Survey

R-K has determined that no significant archeological or historic sites [36 CFR 800.16.(l)] or
SALs (13 TAC Â§26.12) will be affected by this project. It is recommended that cultural
resources be cleared for the project. Upon receiving concurrence from the THC, R-K
recommends that LVWD may proceed with construction activities as planned. Should the
project area change, further work may be required.
In the unlikely event that cultural materials are encountered during construction, all work should
cease at the location of the findings, and an Archaeologist at the THC-Archeology Division
should be contacted. In such a case, work will not commence until authorized by the required
agencies.
