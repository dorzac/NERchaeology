Archeological Resource Survey of a 1,134 Foot Segment of Pipeline Corridor on GLO Land in
Reeves County, Texas

ABSTRACT
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. conducted an archeological resource survey on behalf of
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, LLC in advance of a 1,134-foot segment of
petroleum pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas. Although the proposed
pipeline is part of a larger privately-funded project, this segment is located on property
managed by the Texas General Land Office, and is subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas, thus requiring survey for archeological resources within the project footprint. All
work was carried out to conform to 36 CFR Part 800, and 13 TAC 26 which outline the
regulations for implementing the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Fieldwork was conducted from August 25, 2017 by AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.
(AmaTerra) under Antiquities Permit No. 8139. Fieldwork included a pedestrian survey
with 100-percent surface inspection of the proposed ROW. The surface was found to be
sparsely vegetated with mesquite, creosote bush, and isolated bunches of grass with 90 to
100-percent visible. No artifacts or archeological sites were identified within the project
footprint.
Work on the proposed pipeline is recommended to proceed with no further archeological
investigations. All materials produced while conducting fieldwork will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Facility in Austin, Texas.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT
SUMMARY
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc (AmaTerra) archeologists conducted an archeological
resource survey on behalf of Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, LLC (Flatrock) on
a proposed 1,134-foot segment of petroleum pipeline through land managed by the Texas
General Land Office (GLO) in western Reeves County, Texas. The segment is part of a
larger privately-funded pipeline project spanning from south of Loving, New Mexico to
north of Orla, Texas. The project is located on flat upland segment and is shown in
Figure 1 on the Screw Bean Draw NE, Texas USGS topographic map and on recently
aerial imagery in Figure 2. Because the GLO is a state agency, the 1,134-foot segment
was subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas, thus requiring survey for archeological
resources within the project footprint.
The project’s Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this survey consisted of the 75-foot
right-of-way (ROW) surrounding the proposed pipeline’s centerline, which totals
approximately two acres. AmaTerra archeologists Rachel Feit (Field Director) and Amy
Goldstein (Project Archeologist) expended four person-hours onsite during fieldwork on
August 26, 2017. All work was carried out to conform to 36 CFR Part 800, and 13 TAC
26 which outline the regulations for implementing the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT)
and was surveyed under Antiquities Permit 8139.
Because the survey was of short duration, a short distance, and produced no new
archeological discoveries, this document is laid out in short report format as defined
under the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resource
Reports (2017). Chapter Two will present the methodology used during fieldwork,
Chapter Three will summarize field observations and results, and Chapter Four will
provide recommendations for archeological clearance.

CHAPTER 2

METHODOLOGY
Archeological fieldwork consisted of a pedestrian survey with 100-percent surface
inspection of the proposed APE. Because surface visibility ranged from 80 to 100
percent, no shovel testing was carried out during fieldwork. Had an archeological site
been encountered, shovel tests were proposed in permitting to explore the depth and
extent of deposits.
The survey area was loaded onto handheld GPS units to aid in navigation within the
project APE. Finally, areas of disturbances were photographed and notes were made on
the conditions archeologists encountered during their investigations.
Although the eastern half of the APE was survey by SWCA in 2015, AmaTerra surveyed
the entire project area (Atlas 2017). Four transects were walked within the 75-foot wide
APE, providing a detailed surface inspection at a rate of approximately 20-foot (6-meter)
intervals, well exceeding the recommended maximum 100-foot (30-meter) transect width
recommended under THC guidelines.

CHAPTER 3

SURVEY RESULTS
Fieldwork took place on August 26, 2017. AmaTerra conducted a 100-percent pedestrian
survey of the entire APE. Conditions were cloudy, dry, and unseasonably cool with the
temperature around 85 degrees. The surface of the APE was found to be heavily impacted
in several areas by previous land-clearing, road construction, and pipeline installation
activities (Figures 3 and 4). The undisturbed portions of the project (roughly 80-percent)
consisted of sparsely vegetated clump grasses and broom weed, with scattered soaptree
yucca, mesquite and creosote brush (Figure 5). The ground surface consisted of sandy
soil with occasional caliche and limestone gravels scattered on the surface (Figure 6).
The entire project area was walked by archeologists in two transects walking east to west
and back again for a total of four 20-foot (6-meter) intervals. No archeological sites,
features, or artifacts were observed on the surface of the APE.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On August 26, 2017, AmaTerra archeologists carried out a 100-percent surface
inspection of the proposed 1,134-foot segment of proposed pipeline and its 75-foot ROW
on Texas GLO-managed property in western Reeves County, Texas. Disturbances were
noted in portions of the APE, although most it was clear of visible prior impacts. No
archeological sites, features, or artifacts were observed in the survey area during
fieldwork. AmaTerra recommends that no further work is necessary within the APE prior
to construction. All work was carried out to conform to 36 CFR Part 800, and 13 TAC 26
which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT. No artifacts were collected
during this survey. All records generated during fieldwork will be permanently curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
