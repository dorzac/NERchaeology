ABSTRACT
Archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University conducted
an archaeological survey in advance of the Horseshoe Bay National Recreational Trail project located
in the Llano and Burnet Counties, Texas. Work was conducted by Project Archaeologist Jacob Hooge
and field crewmember Spencer Lodge under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7351, assigned to
Principal Investigator Amy E. Reid.
The archaeological survey consisted of pedestrian survey, as well as the excavation of 32 shovel
tests within three separate but adjoining parcels of land totaling 61 acres located along the eastern
bank of Horseshoe Creek. As a result of the survey, one previously known prehistoric site, 41BT338
was revisited. One surface lithic scatter and three burned rock middens were found to be associated
with site 41BT338. However, no intact cultural strata or temporally diagnostic materials were
recovered. Furthermore, the middens have been impacted by the previous construction of a
mausoleum and by destructive looting activities. CAS recommends that the portion of site 41BT338
within the APE is not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) designation as the site fails to meet the criteria of significance and
integrity. It is very likely that site 41BT338 extends beyond the current APE into areas that have not
been surveyed for cultural resources. Therefore, the overall eligibility of site 41BT338 is considered
undetermined and it should be avoided during construction and protected by the City of Horseshoe
Bay as trail systems are developed and park visitation increases. The City has agreed to perform these
protective measures, and the project is recommended to proceed with no Historic Properties or State
Archeological Landmarks adversely affected and no further cultural resource coordination required.
All project-generated materials and artifacts will be curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies
and Texas State University.

INTRODUCTION
On July 22, 2015, archaeologists from the
Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State
University (CAS) conducted an archaeological
survey in advance of the Horseshoe Bay
National Recreation Trail Project on behalf of
the City of Horseshoe Bay (City). The project
area is located in both Burnet and Llano County
along the eastern bank of the lower 2 km of
Horseshoe Creek just before the creek passes
under HWY 2147 and enters Lake LBJ
(Figure 1). The City proposes to construct over 2
miles of public hiking trails with both natural
surfaces and accessible components over 61
acres of hill country canyon lands above Lake
LBJ (Figure 2). The project is funded by a grant
from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD).

provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code for any
development of City property. In addition, with
federal grant money awarded by the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department from Federal Highway
Administration, compliance with Section 106 is
required. Pursuant to Section 191.052, the City
is required to notify the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) of undertakings before
breaking ground on state or local public land.
Following coordination with the THC
concerning this undertaking, the THC
determined that the project had the potential to
impact possibly significant cultural resources
(Appendix A).Therefore, the THC required the
City to perform an archaeological survey of the
project area prior to any ground disturbing
activity. CAS, on the behalf of the City,
conducted an archaeological survey of the area
of potential effects (APE) defined as the 61 acre
parcel. All work was conducted under Texas

As a political subdivision of the State of
Texas, the City of Horseshoe Bay is subject to

the site cannot be protected.
Encountered cultural remains were also
evaluated relative to the criteria of eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). The criteria for evaluating
cultural resources and determining NRHP
eligibility is provided in 36CFR60 (United
States Congress 2004). The NRHP evaluation
criteria attempt to address the historical
significance of a wide variety of properties, both
historical and archaeological, including places,
structures and objects as stated in 36CR60.4:

As all cultural resources located in, on, or
under State-owned or controlled land are
considered eligible for SAL status, and not all
cultural resources are appropriately designated
as such or directly threatened by development,
the THC has criteria for practically assessing the

PROJECT AREA SETTING
The proposed Park is located straddling the
border between Llano and Burnet Counties in
central Texas (see Figure 1), within the Llano
Uplift physiographic province (Gould 1975)
(Figure 3). The Llano Uplift is within the
Balconian biotic province and is an intermixture
of the surrounding major provinces (Blair 1950).
Dominant vegetation in the area includes oak,
juniper, Texas persimmon, mesquite, little
bluestem, and prickly pear (Dittemore and
Allison 1979). The project area may also
include some riparian vegetation along
Horseshoe creek that may include cottonwood,
pecan, and elm (Gould 1975). The Balconian
province hosts as many as 57 mammalian
species, 16 species of lizard, 36 species of snake,
22 species of amphibians, and one land turtle.
Animals now missing from the landscape but

known to have inhabited the area prior to the
20th Century include beaver, black bear, bison,
wolf, and mountain lion (Blair 1950).
The topography of the area is relatively
rugged to undulating hills characterized by
igneous and metamorphic rock outcrops. There
are two types of soil in the APE; these are
Eckrant-Rock outcrop and Harper-Rock outcrop.
Eckrant series soils are shallow, well-drained
cobbly clays formed from weathered limestone
with slopes ranging from 1 to 20 percent; these
soils are rarely more than 30 cm in depth.
Harper series soils are shallow, well-drained
cobbly clays formed from weathered dolomite
with slopes ranging from 1 to 8 percent; these
soils are rarely more than 40 cm in depth
(Dittemore and Allison 1979).

CENTRAL TEXAS CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Human presence within the region is divided
into three periods: Prehistoric (including
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric),
Protohistoric, and Historic. Evidence for
prehistoric occupation in and around the project
area extends from the Clovis period,
approximately 11,500 radiocarbon years ago up
until the arrival of Spanish explorers almost 400
years ago.

recent research has suggested that early
Paleoindian
subsistence
patterns
were
considerably more diverse than previously
thought and included reliance on local fauna,
including turtles (Black 1989; Bousman et al.
2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983;
Lemke and Timperley 2008). Folsom cultures
are considered to be specialized bison hunters,
as inferred from the geographic location and
artifactual composition of sites (Collins 1995).

Prehistoric

The Late Paleoindian substage occurred
from ca. 10,200 to 8800 BP. Reliable evidence
for these dates was recovered from the WilsonLeonard site north of Austin (Bousman et al.
2004; Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard,
archaeologists excavated an occupation known
as Wilson, named for the unique corner-notched
projectile point. The dense occupation also
included a human burial (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). In addition to the Wilson
occupation, Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s
Hall components, dating between 9500 and 8800
BP, were excavated. Collins (1995) suggested
the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s
Hall components represent a transitional period
between the Paleoindian and Archaic Periods
due to the subtle presence of notched projectile
points and burned rock cooking features.

The Prehistoric period is divided into three
major temporal stages, the Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage
begins with the earliest known human
occupation of North America and extends to
approximately 8800 BP. The Archaic stage
follows, extending from ca. 8800 to 1250 BP,
and is generally seen as a time during which
humans made successful adaptations to changing
environmental conditions. The Late Prehistoric
stage begins ca. 1250 BP and is characterized by
a resurgence of grassland habitats and the
development of bow and arrow and ceramic
technologies.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dated the
Paleoindian period in Central Texas to 11,500–
8800 BP. The Paleoindian period is further
divided into Early (ca. 11,500–10,200 BP) and
Late (ca. 10,200–8800 BP) phases. Diagnostic
Early Paleoindian point types include Clovis,
Folsom and Midland. The Clovis culture is also
characterized by well-made prismatic blades
(Collins 1995; Green 1964). The Early
Paleoindian stage is generally characterized by
nomadic cultures that relied heavily on hunting
large game animals (Black 1989). However,

Archaic
According to Collins (1995, 2004), the
Archaic stage in Central Texas lasted
approximately 7500 years, from 8800 to
1200/1300 BP. He has divided the stage into
Early, Middle, and Late Archaic based on
Weir’s (1976) chronology. The Archaic stage is
characterized by several transitions including a
shift in hunting focus from Pleistocene
megafauna to smaller animals, the increased use

7

of plant food resources and use of ground stones
in food processing, intensified stone cooking
technology, increased use of organic materials
for tool manufacturing and growth in the number
and variety of lithic tools for woodworking, the
predominance of corner- and side-notched
projectile points, greater population stability and
less residential mobility, and systematic burial of
the dead. The markedly increased emphasis on
organic materials in tool technologies and diet is
likely a reflection of preservation bias.
Traditionally, scholars define the end of the
Archaic period by the appearance of bow and
arrow technology around 1200 BP. However,
Lohse and Cholak (2013) argue that this shift,

while important, was relatively insignificant in
comparison with other evidence for strong
cultural continuity until approximately 650 years
ago (Figure 4). Accordingly, the current project
considers the Archaic period as the 5,000 years
encompassing the end of the Early Archaic to
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric Toyah
interval (Table 1). This range is based on the
timing of projectile point styles, sporadic periods
of bison hunting, and, to a lesser degree, some
environmental conditions in the region. The
Archaic starts with the Calf Creek horizon
(including Bell and Andice types), representing
the terminal Early Archaic, and ends with
Scallorn.

available across Texas, although confirming data
are often lacking.

The Holocene marked a significant climate
change associated with the extinction of
megafauna, which stimulated a behavioral
change in land use. Early Archaic groups
focused more intensively on the exploitation of
local resources such as deer, fish, and plant
bulbs. This dietary adjustment is evidenced by
the increased number of ground stone artifacts,
burned-rock middens, and wood-working tools
such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe
bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–256).
Projectile points are dominated by bifurcated or
split-stem morphologies that often grade into
one another in terms of style and design.
Dillehay (1974) argued that bison were widely

The end of the Early Archaic dates to ca.
5750 B.P. (Lohse and Cholak 2013). This date
places the wide-spread Calf Creek horizon, a
brief period closely associated with bison
exploitation across the Southern Plains
(Wyckoff 1994, 1995) at the very end of the
Early Archaic. This placement reflects the close
stratigraphic association at Spring Lake of CalfCreek-related point types (Bell and Andice) with
bison remains as well as immediately preceding
types in the regional sequence, including Merrell
and Martindale. These two types are typical

best known instance in the entire state.

1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) provide
some evidence that populations increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45), although this pattern had begun by
ca. 6,500-7,000 B.P. (Hard and Katzenberg
2011; Ricklis 2005). Numerous projectile point
styles during this period suggest increases in
population pressure and social and technological
divisions between bands. Common styles
include Bulverde, Pedernales, and Marshall
(Late Archaic 1); Montell, Castroville, and
Marcos (Late Archaic 2); and Ensor, Fairland,
and Frio (Late Archaic 3). The Transitional
Archaic and Austin periods, together, represent
the last phase of Archaic lifeways in the region.
Except for the gradual (and poorly dated)
appearance of the bow and arrow, subsistence
practices, settlement patterns, and technological
behaviors appear to change slowly throughout
this period (see Black and Creel 1997; Houk and
Lohse 1993). Point styles that define this final
transitional interval include Darl and Scallorn.
Burials from this time reveal a high proportion
of arrow-wound deaths (Black 1989; Prewitt
1974), perhaps suggesting some disputes over
resource availability.

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic in Central Texas dates
from 5750-4200/4100 and is generally
associated with the Altithermal, a prolonged
period when the climate fluctuated from arid to
mesic, then back to arid in Central Texas.
Vegetation and wildlife regimes all fluctuated in
response to these environmental oscillations,
with human groups responding accordingly.
Large ungulates (bison) are absent from the
record during this time. The Middle Archaic is
characterized by two primary projectile point
style intervals: Early Triangular (Taylor and
Baird types), and Nolan and Travis. Taylor
bifaces are broad and triangular, similar to the
earlier Calf Creek Styles, but lacking any basal
notches. By the latter part of the Middle
Archaic, Nolan and Travis points predominate;
both are technologically and stylistically
dissimilar to the preceding styles (Collins 1995,
2004). The Nolan-Travis interval was also a
period when temperature and aridity were at
their peaks. Prehistoric inhabitants acclimated
themselves to peak aridity as seen through
increased utilization of xerophytes such as sotol
(Johnson and Goode 1994). These plants,
typically baked in earthen ovens, also reflect the
development of burned rock middens. During
more arid episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and
resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

Late Prehistoric
Historically, following J. Charles Kelley
(1947), archaeologists divide the Late
Prehistoric is into two phases, Austin and
Toyah. However, the present authors consider
the Central Texas Late Prehistoric to be limited
to the Toyah interval beginning at approximately
AD 1300 based on a sudden appearance of bison
in the regional record (Table 1). Dating the end
of Toyah is complicated, since material traits
clearly extend into the early part of the Historic
period (Arnn 2012). In general, this period is
marked by the (apparently) complete shift away
from the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow,
and by the incorporation of pottery throughout
the region (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47).
Importantly, Toyah peoples were interacting in a

broad network of exchange focused on bison and
bison by-products. This network appeared in
Southern Plains areas to the north (Spielman
1991), stretched from Pueblo areas to the west to
Mississippian villages in the east, and involved
agricultural goods, people (especially women),
exotic materials like obsidian, ceramics, and
other resources. Evidence for the movement of
peoples into the study area comes from stable
isotope values from a human burial from the
University campus; data show this woman from
coastal regions had moved to Central Texas as

to the establishment of Mission San Antonio de
Valero in 1718).
With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680,
El Camino Real (the King’s Road) was
established from Villa Santiago de la Monclova
in Mexico to East Texas. This roadway followed
established Native American trade routes and
trails and became a vital link between Mission
San Juan Bautista in Northern Mexico and the
Spanish settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas
(McGraw et al. 1991). Spanish priests
accompanying entradas provided the most
complete information of indigenous cultures of
early Texas. Those documented during the early
entradas include the Cantona, Muruam, Payaya,
Sana, and Yojuane, who were settled around the
springs at San Marcos and described as seminomadic bands. Other tribes encountered in the
Central Texas Region included mobile hunting
parties from villages in South and West Texas,
including Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading toward
bison hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies
(Foster 1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell
1992; Newcomb 1993). Later groups who
migrated into the region and displaced the earlier
groups or tribes included the Tonkawa from
Oklahoma and Lipan and Comanche from the
Plains (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Dunn
1911; Newcomb 1961, 1993).

The beginning of the Toyah period (650
B.P.) in Central Texas is marked by contracting
stem points and flaring, barbed shouldered
points. Perdiz is the most common example
(Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346), and this
type occasionally occurs on glass in mission
contexts (Lohse 1999:268). Toyah is also
characterized by its tools, like prismatic blades
and blade cores, which are considered part of a
specialized bison hunting and processing toolkit
(Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994). However, wide technological
variability is present, including both lithics and
ceramics, suggesting a diverse social landscape
(Arnn 2012).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)

Archaeological sites dated to this period
often contain a mix of both European imported
goods, such as metal objects and glass beads,
and traditional Native American artifacts, such
as manufactured stone tools.

In Texas, the Protohistoric period was
marked by Spanish entradas, the formal
expeditions from established forts and missions
in Northern Mexico into Central, Coastal, and
East Texas in the late seventeenth and early
eighteenth centuries. These encounters began
with the venture into Texas by the Spanish
explorer Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez
expedition in 1528. The period is generally
dated between AD 1500 and 1700 (or 1528, the
date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez expedition,

Historic
The Historic period in Texas began with
Coronado’s 1540-1542 expedition to the Plains
of Cibola located in the High Plains, northwest
of the project area. Most knowledge of this

11

period has been gained through the written
records of the early Spanish missionaries.
Coronado’s accounts and those of later Spanish
expeditions report that the region was occupied
by Apacha (Apache) people who had limited
sedentism and seasonal hunting and foraging.
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995).
Besides the mission town of San
Antonio, other Spanish settlements in the region
include San Marcos de Neve, established in
1808, four miles south of present day San
Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was abandoned in
1812 as a result of constant raids by local tribes
(Dobie 1932). During this time, massive
depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little
resistance. Those few indigenous people
remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

County) in 1846. In 1847 John O. Meusebach,
the leader of the German settlers, negotiated a
treaty with the Comanches to permit Germans to
live in the area of the Fisher-Miller Land Grant,
which included what is now Llano County
(TSHA online 2015).
Llano County was organized in 1856 after
the Texas legislature formed the county from the
Bexar District and Gillespie County. By 1858,
the population exceeded 1,000, and cattle, hides,
and pecans were being exported. Farming was
the chief occupation in the north and ranching in
the south. Germans predominated in the western
parts and Anglo-Americans in the other areas.
By 1860 the county had 89 farms, encompassing
59,744 acres. The agricultural census that year
reported 21,344 cattle and 1,492 sheep in Llano
County, and the corn harvest exceeded 23,500
bushels. The United States census found 1,101
people living in the county that year; of these, 21
were slaveholders and 54 were slaves (TSHA
online 2015).
When the Civil War came, several
companies were organized in the area, known as
the Third Frontier District. Many residents of
Burnet and Llano counties joined the
Confederate Army. Once the war was over,
settlers returned and new families immigrated
into the area. Residents in these counties
encountered many conflicts with the Comanche.

European presence in the region increased as
settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. The area that was later
established as Burnet County formed parts of
both the Robertson and Austin-Williams
Mexican Land-grant colonies. However, at the
time of Texas Independence, the majority of the
land in the region was still public domain and
unsettled. Settlement was difficult due to
continuation of hostilities with and raids by
Native American tribes. The Texas Rangers
provided protection from these conflicts after
Texas secured independence from Mexico in
1836.

In the 1880s, Llano County began
commercially producing minerals and building
stone for various uses nationwide. The most
profitable mineral that was mined here was
granite, which helped boost the county’s
economy along with the completion of the
railroad from Burnet in 1892 (Oatman 1970).

The first permanent settlers of European
origin in the area were brought in by the
Adelsverein. German settlers established the
town of New Braunfels (now in Comal County)
in 1845, and Fredericksburg (now in Gillespie

Like the rest of the Southwest, Llano County
was hit hard by depression and drought during
the 1930s. Government aid and construction
projects, like the Lower Colorado River

12

Authority dam construction projects, helped the
county to get through the depression in spite of
the general decline in agriculture.

Angora goats and turkey production were a
significant part of the economy in the 1970s. In
Burnet County, the economy was mostly formed
by cotton agriculture and stock rearing during
the nineteenth century. Today the area is popular
for deer hunting as well as tourism driven by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Enchanted Rock State
Natural Area and Lake L.B.J.

Though cattle ranching remains the single
most important element of Llano County's
agricultural economy, the county is also one of
the ten leading producers of hogs in Texas.

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
Previous archaeological investigations in
areas adjacent to the south and east side of Lake
LBJ have demonstrated that a high probability of
encountering historic and prehistoric resources
exists within the APE (THC Sites Atlas; Benfer
and Benfer 1965; Crawford 1965; Wernecke and
Collins 2009). The APE falls within the greater
Central Texas archaeological region. This region
is known for its rich and diverse prehistoric
cultural resources dating back at least 14,000
years (Collins 2004; Collins and Bradley 2008).
A review of the online Texas Archaeological
Sites Atlas indicated there are 5 recorded

archaeological sites within 2 km of the APE;
these are 41LL373, 41LL414, 41BT338,
41BT440, and 41BT454 (Figure 5). All five
sites are prehistoric sites characterized by
burned-rock middens with associated upland
lithic scatters. The closest site to the project area
is site 41BT338. According to the Atlas,
41BT338 is located approximately 50 m from
the present project boundary and consists of
three large burned rock middens and associated
lithic scatters as well as a cluster of limestone
boulders.

Texas-Austin.

Goals and Methods
The primary objectives of this investigation
were to identify any cultural resources on the
surface or subsurface of the APE. Information
gathered from this investigation is to be used to
determine the projected impacts to any located
archaeological resources. Eligibility for SAL
and NRHP listing was evaluated as well at the
potential need for further archaeological
investigations.

Results
Pedestrian Survey
The APE is located on the east bank of the
lower 2 km of Horseshoe Creek just before the
creek passes under HWY 2147 and enters Lake
LBJ. Vegetation in the area includes primarily
prickly pear, live oak and ashe juniper with
pockets of dense knee to chest high grasses
alongside and within the creek. A mausoleum is
located in the southwest end of the project area
and an existing concrete pathway connects the
structure to a gravel parking lot (Figure 5). The
majority of the APE consists of moderate to
steep slopes of exposed limestone/dolomite
bedrock oriented towards the creek. With the
exception of the southwest end along with
several small terraces adjacent to the creek, the
majority of the APE was determined to have
little to no potential for containing buried
cultural remains. No cultural materials other
than modern refuse were observed on the surface
north of the mausoleum during the pedestrian
survey.

Field Methods
Following
comprehensive
background
research, CAS archaeologists conducted a 100%
visual pedestrian survey augmented by
subsurface testing consisting of the excavation
of 33 shovel tests. Investigations were carried
out in accordance with and exceeded survey
standards developed by the CTA and adopted by
the THC. Due to the sloped topographic setting
and abundance of exposed bedrock within the
APE, shovel tests were opportunistically placed
in suitable, level areas containing sediment.
Tests were manually excavated in arbitrary 20centimeter levels to a depth of 100 cm below
surface, or until bedrock was reached. Tests
were 30 cm in diameter, and all excavated
sediments were screened through ¼- inch
hardware screen. All excavations were
backfilled upon completion and locations were
recorded with a Trimble GEO XT handheld GPS
unit. All cultural material within shovel tests
was collected as well as diagnostic material
encountered on the surface. Positive shovel tests
were further investigated by excavation of
additional tests in order to determine site
boundaries. Site boundaries were defined by
both surface and subsurface artifact and feature
distribution as well as topographic boundaries.
Sites were photographed and mapped, and all
site data was recorded on a Texsite form and
placed on file at the Texas Archaeological

During the pedestrian survey, three roughly
circular burned rock middens were encountered
in the southwest end of the APE in a thickly
wooded area all within several meters of the
concrete path leading to the mausoleum (Figures
6 and 7). The westernmost midden is the largest
at 16 to 18 m in diameter and possibly as high as
1.5 m above bedrock. The other two middens are
roughly equal in size at 12 to 15 m in diameter
and up to 0.5 m above bedrock. On the surface,
the middens appear to consist of only about 10
percent burned rock with the rest having very
rounded edges consistent with natural limestone
cobbles. Other than burned rock, only a tested
chert cobble and an Anheuser-Busch beer bottle
were present on the surface of the middens.

17

A surface scatter of lithic debitage
and mussel shell was identified
approximately 15 m northwest of the
northern-most midden on a small
bedrock exposure overlooking the creek
(see Figure 7). The cultural material in
this area is most likely deflated from the
nearby burned rock midden. No
diagnostic artifacts were encountered;
however, a sample of the larger
debitage
was
documented
and
photographed (Figure 8). The area in
which artifacts are visible on the surface
is approximately 15 to 25 m in
diameter.
Two other cultural features were

cobbles at the surface is likely a result of
weathering.
Subsurface Testing
Thirty-three shovel tests were placed on
stable landforms within the APE and 10 are
positive for prehistoric cultural material
(Figure 11, Table 2). Seventeen shovel tests
were placed in the APE’s southwest end near the
burned rock middens and in areas where bedrock
was not exposed at the surface in order to
identify the prehistoric site’s boundaries (see
Figure 7). Five shovel test excavations located
on the terrace southwest of the midden and
surface lithic scatter yielded prehistoric material.
Although no diagnostic artifacts were recovered,

Fifteen shovel tests were placed on terraces
along the eastern bank of Horseshoe Creek
within the northern portion of the APE
(Figure 12). Although the terraces are relatively
low and within close proximity to the creek, they
are the only landforms other than the southwest
end of the APE that were determined to have
possibly contained buried cultural material.
Shovel tests 22, 24 and 28 contained buried
cultural material indicating the site boundaries
for 41BT338 extend to the north at least as far as
shovel test 28.

northeast of this site, CAS has determined that
the site recorded during the present survey is the
correct location of 41BT338. The Texsite form

recorded in 1998 includes a sketch map which
shows the three middens in approximately the
same location relative to the mausoleum as
identified during the present pedestrian survey

Due to the presence of three burned rock
middens as well as prehistoric cultural material
visible from the surface and encountered within
shovel tests, a prehistoric site was recorded.

41BT338 is located approximately 400 m

exist in the stream terrace between the middens
and Horseshoe Creek as well as to the southwest
outside the APE. Though, these deposits are not
likely to be deeply buried since nearby shovel
tests terminated at bedrock or dense
concentrations of river-worn cobbles no deeper
than 40 cmbs. It should also be noted that the
presence of rounded/river worn cobbles
observed below 20 cm within the shovel tests
located on the stream terrace indicates that the
environment of deposition was relatively high in
energy and therefore the cultural deposits lack
adequate contextual integrity.

Site 41BT338 is a prehistoric site containing
a surface lithic scatter and three burned rock
middens. Though no temporally diagnostic
materials were recovered, the large size of the
burned rock middens indicates the site was
likely used for a relatively extended period of
time. Shovel tests adjacent to the middens
indicate that some buried cultural materials may

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Burned rock middens are a common feature
found in archaeological sites within the Central
Texas region. Burned rock middens represent
the accumulation of discarded rock material that
was used in earth oven cooking, open air
cooking and hearths during prehistoric times.
Without any diagnostic artifacts located, the
middens cannot be dated. We do know however
that stone cooking technology is a key
characteristic of the Archaic time period (~ 8800
– 1200 years bp) as transitions including a shift
from hunting Pleistocene megafauna to hunting
smaller mammals and the increased use of plant
food resources occurred. The presence of three
relatively large middens combined with
evidence for stone tool production (lithic scatter)
and proximity to a water source, suggests that a
habitation site is likely to have been located
nearby. However, the present survey did not
identify a site of this nature within the APE.

looting has already occurred, any trails that do
not involve ground disturbing construction
activities are unlikely to further impact the site.
With signage prohibiting visitors of a
prohibition on going off trail, digging, and/or
collecting, increased traffic may actually serve
to protect the site as many more witnesses to
illegal activities will be present than were
before.
The research value of the portion of site
41BT338 that was recorded by both pedestrian
and subsurface survey within the APE is
considered to be minimal due to shallow soils
limiting the potential for deeply buried deposits
as well as the lack of diagnostic artifacts and the
paucity of cultural material encountered in
shovel tests. Furthermore, because of the
common occurrence of upland lithic sites,
combined with their inability to strengthen our
understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the
region using current research methods, CAS has
determined that the portion of site 41BT338 that
exists within the APE does not meet eligibility
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP nor for SAL
designation.

Although three burned rock middens are
present at the site, they have been significantly
impacted previously by looting and the
construction of the mausoleum. The builders of
the mausoleum and concrete path were likely
aware of the middens as the path is routed
purposefully through the three features.
Although the construction surely impacted a
portion of the site’s subsurface deposits, some
care to avoid the middens was clearly taken. The
low concentration of artifacts other than burned
rock at the site could indicate several
possibilities. Much of the diagnostic material
may have been removed by relic hunters. It is
also possible habitation/activity areas associated
with the site exist either outside the APE or have
been completely deflated from the upland above.

Archaeological survey investigations of the
Horseshoe Bay Trail did not reveal cultural
resources that could be considered significant to
the City’s, State’s, or Country’s history. CAS
recommends that the portion of Site 41BT338
that exists within the APE is not considered
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for SAL
designation. However, with a high potential for
the boundaries of site 41BT338 to extend
outside of the present APE into areas that have
not been subject to archaeological survey, the
overall eligibility of site 41BT338 is considered
undetermined. As such, CAS recommends full
regulatory clearance for the present trail project

middle of the site already exists and some

and avoidance plan coordinated with and
approved by the THC (see Appendix A):

notifying the public about the
sensitive nature of archaeological
sites on public property and the
unlawfulness of disturbing them.
Signs should not contain specific
information about the location of site
41BT338.

1. The City should protect the site from
further disturbance and looting.
2. The City should ensure that trail
construction methods are non-ground

away from the burned rock midden
areas (Figure 14).

4. The City should continue to
coordinate future trail projects or
other development that will take
place near site 41BT338, whether
they are proposed within the present
project area or nearby City property.
