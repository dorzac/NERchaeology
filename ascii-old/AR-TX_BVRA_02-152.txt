ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey at several locations along an 8.8-mile (5.3 acres)
proposed water line in Anderson County, Texas was performed in August of 2005 by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) for the Poynor Water Supply Corporation
(WSC) under Antiquities Permit 3867. The project area was investigated by a field
assessment, 100% Pedestrian Survey, and shovel testing and probing. Previously
recorded site 41AN14 is depicted on the TARL maps as within the route of the water line.
Archival research revealed this plotting is not correct, and this was confirmed by the field
survey. No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found as a result of this
investigation. Two cemeteries (Foster and Pleasant Hill) are near the project area. The
Foster Cemetery contains graves dating from the 1800s and early 1900s. A State of
Texas marker depicts the site of the former grave of Cynthia Ann Parker within this
cemetery. Ms. Parker is known for living in captivity with the Comanche Indians and being
the mother of Comanche War Chief, Quanah Parker. The Pleasant Hill Cemetery is
modern with the oldest grave dating to 1964.

INTRODUCTION
The Poynor WSC plans to install new water line within the rights-of-way of county
roads along an 8.8 mile segment of rural Anderson County (Figure 1). Also, a water plant
will be constructed on a 100 x 100â site on the east side of County Road 3141. The project
area is depicted on the USGS topographic map Poynor dated 1978 and revised 1984
(figures 2-3). The water line will be PVC pipe and will vary in size from 2â to 6â in diameter.
The line will cross prime farmland, hydric soil, and potential wetlands. It will be installed in
the highway ROW parallel to existing lines when possible to provide additional flow and
pressure throughout the system. The ditches needed for the pipe will be 6â to 12â wide
and will be a minimum of 30â deep.
Anderson County is located in a part of Texas that contains numerous prehistoric
and historic sites, many of which have been considered to possess significant research
potential. This county is in the area once inhabited by the prehistoric Caddo Indians of
Northeast Texas. Many of these sites contain burials and pottery vessels of exceptional
quality. Vandalism of archaeological sites in this area is a serious problem, and the
number of intact Caddoan sites is rapidly decreasing.
The Texas Historical Society, Archeology Division, requested a cultural resources
survey be performed by a professional archaeologist prior to installation of the water line.
In order to comply with this request, the Poynor WSC retained BVRA of Bryan, Texas to
conduct this investigation. The project number assigned by BVRA is 05-11.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province as defined by Fenneman (1946) and the Austropriarian biotic province as defined
by Blair (1950:98-100). The reader is referred to Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of
Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for a more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area.
Data taken from the Texas Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris 1983) states that
the county receives 40.51 inches of annual rainfall. When combined with a January
minimum temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 94
degrees Fahrenheit, a growing season of 264 days results. Fauna known to be present
within the project area at various times of the year include fox and gray squirrel, armadillo,
raccoon, opossum, cottontail rabbits, white-tailed deer, coyote, beaver, and feral hogs.
Many birds utilize the site including dove, meadowlark, killdeers, various sparrows, great
blue herons, bluebirds, mockingbirds, and cardinals.
Much of the project area is in upland setting with elevations at or greater than 400
feet above mean sea level. A large portion of the project area was heavily wooded with
mixed hardwoods and various kinds of under story vegetation present. Some areas were
in pasture. No major creeks cross any of the roads within the project area. Only unnamed
tributaries and the upper reaches of tributaries are present. The soils were observed to be
sand over firm red clay.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Anderson County is located in the Northeast Texas Archeological Study Region of
the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the Department of Antiquities Protection in
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). According to the planning document, there were 121 sites recorded in the
county as of 1991 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:41). In the region, Anderson County was
16th in terms of numbers of sites recorded. Of the 121 recorded sites, 12 were considered
not significant, 41 were of unknown significance, 46 were probably significant, and 22 were
significant. Two sites (41AN19 and 41AN51) are listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. Site 41AN51, the Pace McDonald site, has been discussed in an unpublished
manuscript by Thurmond (1978) on file at TARL. At the time of this survey there were
approximately 160 recorded prehistoric and historic sites in the county.
The Archeological Bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas (Martin 1990)
cites 50 references for the county. Although many of these investigations have been small
area surveys, often resulting in negative findings, several major reservoir projects have
been conducted. These are the Blackburn Crossing Reservoir (Johnson 1958, 1961),
Palestine Reservoir (Anderson et al. 1974), Tennessee Colony Lake (Richner 1977;
Richner and Lee 1976, 1977), Trinity River Basin (Richner and Bagot 1978), and the
Trinity River Multiple Use Project (Sorrow 1973). Overviews of the area include works by
(Lynott and Richner 1977), Woodall (1972), and Story, et al. (1990).
Prehistoric occupations in the region cover all time periods from Paleoindian
through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:44).
The reader is referred to this comprehensive and well organized document for additional
information regarding the archaeological background for Anderson County and vicinity.
Numerous prehistoric sites have been recorded along Caddo Creek just to the
north of the project area in Anderson and Henderson counties and along Caney Branch to
the east in Anderson County. Several of these sites were investigated in the 1930s under
the direction of A. M. Woolsey and A. T. Jackson of The University of Texas at Austin.
Although collections were sometimes curated, site forms and formal reports may not exist.
Most of these sites have been described as Caddoan, and some contain burials with grave
goods. According to the few site forms that are present, the preferred location for sites
appears to be terraces adjacent to streams. Archaic hunting sites were recorded during
the Lake Palestine survey in 1960s and early 1970s (Anderson 1971). Sites found during
this study were predominantly associated with âstreamside locations near relatively fertile
soilsâ (Anderson 1971:iii).

METHODS
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Jean Hughes at TARL. The Principal Investigator and
Project Engineer drove the entire route of the proposed water line in an attempt to identify
high probability areas for survey. All creek crossings were evaluated, and one historic
cemetery and one modern cemetery were observed. Previously recorded site 41AN14 is
depicted on the TARL maps as being within the project area. The field assessment
identified this area as an unlikely setting for a prehistoric site based on an absence of a
nearby water source. The Principal Investigator and Project Engineer visited the Anderson
County Courthouse, Anderson County Tax Appraisal Office, and local abstract office to
check land ownership in the project area against the landowners mentioned on the site
map for 41AN14. It was learned that the site had been incorrectly plotted on the maps at
TARL.
Two important reports were reviewed during the planning stages of this project.
These are a planning document by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993) and an archeological bibliography for the Northeastern Region of
Texas (Martin 1990). The interested reader is referred to these sources for additional
information regarding the prehistory of this area.
Field Tasks
The field investigation was conducted on August 2, 2005. Five areas selected for
survey were investigated. Two creek crossings (Area 2 and Area 3) were investigated
through a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel probing. Shovel testing was performed in
Area 2. Exposed cut banks along the entire length of each of these areas were examined.
All dirt excavated by shovel testing was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth. A shovel
test log was maintained (Appendix I), and the approximate location of each test was
plotted on the field map. The two cemeteries were visited and photographed. The area
where site 41AN14 is plotted on the TARL maps was evaluated. This area was walked,
and a careful inspection of the disturbed surface was examined for cultural materials. Two
shovel tests were excavated, one on each side of the road. All five areas investigated
were documented with a hand-held GPS and photographed with a digital camera.

AREAS SURVEYED
Area 1
This is the area where site 41AN14 is plotted on the maps at TARL (Appendix II) as
being on both sides of County Road 3141 (Figure 4). A GPS position was established
from the topographic quadrangle plotting, and this area was visited and examined. At the
time of this survey, the road was deeply entrenched (2-3 feet) into the sandy soil and had
a ditch and sloped bank on each side. A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on both
sides of the road the entire length of the plotted site area. Surface visibility was estimated
at 60% to 70%. The proposed water line will be placed in the county road ROW. Two
shovel tests were excavated, one on each side of the road.

Figure 4. Area 1

Area 2
This area is a creek crossing on the north side of County Road 312 and both banks
of an unnamed tributary of Caddo Creek from the western upland margin to the eastern
upland margin (Figure 5). In this location the water line will not parallel existing line. New
line will be installed. At the time of this survey, the road was deeply cut into the slopes and
upland portions of the project area exposing a vertical cut bank profile. A mantle of sand
30 cm to 40 cm thick was present over the underlying red clay (Figure 6). The entire
length of this profile along Area 2 was visually examined. The proposed water line will
have to be placed in the ditch since the top of the bank was the edge of the ROW and the
ditch consists of very hard red clay. Sand deposits were observed east of the creek on a
flat terrace on which three houses had been built. Four shovel tests were excavated in
this sandy area.

Area 3
This area is a creek crossing on the north side of County Road 312 and both banks
of an unnamed tributary of Caddo Creek from the western upland margin to the eastern
upland margin (Figure 7). In this location the water line will not parallel existing line. New
line will be installed. At the time of this survey, the road was deeply cut into the slopes and
upland portions of the project area exposing a vertical cut bank profile. A mantle of sand
30 cm to 40 cm thick was present over the underlying red clay (Figure 7). The entire
length of this profile along Area 3 was visually examined, and tested with shovel probes.
The proposed water line will have to be placed in the ditch since the top of the bank was
the edge of the ROW and the ditch was in hard red clay on the slopes and upland areas.
Near the creek, shallow over bank deposit sand was present in the ROW, but recent
bulldozer work had disturbed the project area allowing for 100% visibility.

Area 4
The Foster Cemetery is on the north side of County Road 478 (Figure 9). At the
time of this survey, part of the cemetery had been mowed and fenced and was generally
well maintained. The entrance to the mowed part of the cemetery is 250 feet from the
road along a cleared area (Figure 10). A dense woods lies between the fenced cemetery
and the road. Graves were observed in these woods within 10 meters of the road. The
ROW and the graves in the woods are only separated by a few strands of barbed wire. In
the fenced area, graves dating to the 1800s and early 1900s were observed. A State of
Texas Historical Marker depicts the original gravesite of Cynthia Ann Parker. Ms. Parker
was the mother of Quanah Parker, war chief of the Comanche. According to Margaret
Schmidt Hacker (Handbook of Texas Online), Ms. Parker died near the Anderson and
Henderson county line and was buried in Fosterville Cemetery, and there are several
references to Fosterville Cemetery on early maps. In 1910, her son Quanah moved her
body to the Post Oak Cemetery near Cache, Oklahoma. Her body, as well as that of her
son Quanah, were later moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 1957. According to C. C. (Kip)
Camp of the Anderson County Historical Commission, the fenced cemetery contains the
remains of Anglos and Negroes. This investigation was not able to determine if the graves
in the woods are part of the fenced cemetery or if these are two different resting places.

Area 5
The Pleasant Hill Cemetery is located on the east side of County Road 3141
(Figure 11). The road curves at the southwest corner of the cemetery and comes within
four feet of the fence. Currently, only the western one-quarter of the cemetery has graves,
and these are separated into a north section and a south section. There are graves at the
southwest corner by the road. At the time of this survey, the cemetery was fenced and
had been mowed (Figure 12). The earliest grave observed was dated 1964. This
investigation was unable to determine the ethnicity of this cemetery.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Literature Review
The records check at TARL revealed that no professional investigations have been
conducted in the project area. Most of the sites recorded in Anderson County were
probably located during the Lake Palestine survey (Anderson 1971) and a survey of the
Trinity River basin (Richner and Bagot 1978). Both endeavors were conducted by
Southern Methodist University. According to Carolyn Spock (personal communication,
June 10, 1994), there was a surge of site recording for the county during 1979 (62 sites),
1980 (62 sites), and 1981 (79 sites). Most of these are believed to represent TARL
numbers being assigned to previously recorded sites by Southern Methodist University
from the Lake Palestine and Trinity River Basin projects. According to the site records at
TARL, one prehistoric site (41AN14) lies within the path of the water line as currently
proposed. The topographic maps also depict the presence of two cemeteries (Foster and
Pleasant Hill) near the path of the water line.
Field Survey
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found as a result of this survey.
Previously recorded site 41AN14 was found to be incorrectly plotted on the topographic
maps on file at TARL. A site map on file at TARL lists this site as been located on the
Gene and Isabel Donnell place. The area where the site is plotted is located in the Robert
Myers abstract (A-571, Block Number 705). The records search revealed that no persons
named Donnell owned property in this block in the 1930s when the site was investigated
by archaeologists from The University of Texas at Austin. Property owned by Frank
Donnell during the time this site was investigated was found to be to the north in the Alfred
Benge abstract (A-106, Block 707). According to the site records at TARL, 41AN14 is one
of a group of sites in Anderson County that were plotted on the topographic maps using
only sketchy records.
The field survey confirmed the location of the two cemeteries depicted on the
topographic map, Foster and Pleasant Hill. In the area of the Foster Cemetery, two
separate areas containing graves were identified. One is a fenced and mowed area
approximately 250 feet from the county road. This area is identified by a sign at the
entrance as the Foster Cemetery. There are additional graves in the woods (not fenced)
adjacent to the county road with the nearest grave approximately 10 meters from the road.
Mr. Camp of the Anderson County Historical Commission was not aware of this cemetery,
and he does not know if it represents a separate resting place or is part of the fenced
portion of Foster Cemetery to the north. The fenced cemetery contains the graves of
Negroes and Anglo-Americans and dates from the 1800s through early 1900s.

17

As discussed above, the site of the former grave of Cynthia Ann Parker is identified
by a State of Texas marker. Ms. Parker was the mother of Quanah Parker, famous
Comanche war chief. The cemetery in the woods contains graves dating to the 20th
Century, but no attempt was made to record the dates of every grave. Foster Cemetery
may be eligible for nomination as a Texas Historic Cemetery.
Pleasant Hill is a fenced and mowed cemetery near the community of Pleasant Hill
and is adjacent to County Road 3141. It contains graves dating to the 20th Century with
the oldest dated at 1964. It does not meet the age requirement for nomination as a Texas
Historic Cemetery.

18

RECOMMENDATIONS
Previously recorded site 41AN14 was found to be incorrectly plotted. Therefore,
construction of the water line in this area should be allowed to proceed as planned. Two
areas containing graves were identified in the area of the Foster Cemetery. Since the area
near the road is not fenced, it is recommended that the water line be placed across the
road. If the water line is placed on the same side of the road as the cemetery, scraping
under the supervision of a professional archaeologist is recommended. The Pleasant Hill
Cemetery was found to be fenced and modern in age (1960s and later). Since the water
line will be placed across the road from this cemetery, no scraping or monitoring is
necessary. It is recommended that no restrictions be placed on the installation of the
water line in the remainder of the project area.
