Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of the proposed TXMISolomon Cellular Tower in north-central Midland County, Texas. The Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required,
but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is 3,600 square feet (<0.09
acre), in addition to a 35-foot wide access and utility easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 21, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. A dispersed historic trash
scatter was discovered in a cultivated field where the tower and access/utility easement are to be
constructed. The historic trash scatter was subsequently designated as 41MD53.
Tierras Antiguas assessed the trash scatter as predominately surficial in nature, or otherwise
artifacts have been shallowly buried due to cultivation. As such, it is very heavily disturbed,
possesses minimal integrity at best, and is therefore considered to be non-significant.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

In December 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or
within one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

County that has apparently been used primarily for agricultural purposes, and has otherwise been
relatively undisturbed.

Project Environment
The Project Area lies in west Texas, within the northern area of Midland County, at the southern
edge of the High Plains, or Rolling Plains, (Osage Plains), an undulating plain with sometimes
steeply eroded canyons. Bordering the Project Area on the east is the Edwards Plateau in Central
Texas’ “Hill Country”, so named for its rugged, stream-eroded topography. The Rolling Plains,
with its silty clay loams and stony clays in the valleys overlying Permian-age silt and sandstone
beds, covers nearly 90 percent of Midland County, gradually changing into fine sandy loams on
the eroded slopes of the Edwards Plateau. Geologically, the extreme eastern area provides
abundant outcrops of limestone and gravels from the Edwards limestone and San Angelo
conglomerate formations. Physiographically, the region falls in the Northwest Margin of the
Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains province. Elevation in Midland County ranges from
2,550 to 2,900 feet above mean sea level (Fenneman 1931; Leffler 1996).
Modern and Historic Climate
The modern climate of the Midland County area is classified as semi-arid, though humidity, often
in excess of 40 percent, is high for such a characterization. Large fluctuations in temperature occur
throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from an average maximum 95 degrees
during the Summer to around 31 degrees in the Winter. The average annual precipitation is just
under 14 inches, though significant fluctuations are common. The combination of variable rainfall
and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture
(Hyde et al. 1973; Leffler 2014).
Hydrology
In modern times, there are no constantly flowing streams or permanent standing water in Midland
County. Although, there are numerous small playas that hold water from periodic rainfalls, and
abundant water is provided from wells. To the southeast in modern-day Reagan County, the ‘Big
Lake’ area was settled in 1905 on the west side of this large fresh-water filled. In the 1800s and
1900s, Big Lake was the only fresh water source between the Concho rivers near San Angelo to
the east, and Comanche Springs at Fort Stockton to the west.
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the TXMI-Solomon Tower is to be constructed in Amarillo fine sandy loam
(AfA), commonly found on 0 to 1 percent sloping uplands in this area of Midland County. These
are moderately deep, friable, sandy and loamy soils that developed from calcareous sediments on
slightly convex to plane uplands (Hyde et al. 1973; WebSoil Survey Online 2014), with a minimal
to moderate potential for intact archaeological deposits to exist as deep as about 40 inches below
the surface. A typical soil pedon of Amarillo fine sandy loam is as follows:
0 to 10 inches, reddish-brown fine sandy loam
3

10 to 24 inches, reddish-brown sandy clay loam
24 to 40 inches, yellowish-red, calcareous, sandy clay loam
40 to 51 inches, pink sandy clay loam, with 30% calcium carbonate
51 to 60 inches, light reddish-brown, highly calcareous

Cultural Chronology
The location of the TXMI-Solomon Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities
indigenous both to the western edge of the Central Texas region as well as intrusive influences
from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but differing
arguments for cultural chronologies for Central Texas and the Southern Great Plains extending
into northern Texas, and the Project Area. Using the earlier works of Suhm (1960), Johnson et al.
(1962) and Sorrow et al. (1967) as a springboard, Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981, 1985) sorted
through the archaeological data from central Texas and established a chronology defined by
4

phases. Although
some of their data has
been criticized as
unreliable and their
phases critiqued as
a c t u al p a t t e r n s ,
chronological
markers, and intervals
(e.g. Collins 1995;
Johnson 1987), they
energized fellow
colleagues to
investigate empirical
methods for inferring
cultural behavior.
Black (1989a,b)
synthesized the data
of high validity
available at the time
and offered a

of

accepted. Collins
(1995) reviewed the Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from Black

palynological evidence
for central Texas and offered new approximate dates for human occupation from the Paleoindian
through Historic periods.
The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the
North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently, the
Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should be
noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and
subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of change in central and south
Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Black (1995), Collins (1995), Hester
(1995), Johnson and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989), and adapted
from Nickels' (2000) synthesis of the literature. A brief discussion of the Transitional Archaic as
defined by Turner et al. (2011) and Hester (1995) is also presented. All dates are approximate and
given as years before present (B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. The argument that artifacts recovered from Levi Rockshelter in Travis
5

County are older than Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133-145) is not supported by clustered
radiocarbon dates or distinct artifact and extinct fauna assemblages within well-defined
stratigraphy (Collins 1995:380-381). Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from
Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger 1964) and mammoth bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic for the same reasons given for Levi Rockshelter. Although several skulls of
“pre-sapien ancestry with low sloping foreheads, a pronounced supra-orbital torus, and a marked
postorbital construction” were found in Hitzfelder Cave in northeast Bexar County, no
radiocarbon dates are available to substantiate their surmised antiquity. The Middle Archaic points
found with the burials suggest the skeletons are more likely 5,000 to 6,000 years old (Givens
1968a:219). At Lewisville Lake on the Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon
dates initially believed to be from burned charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof
of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable
landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts
stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing
conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins
and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. This phase spans the period
estimated at between ca. 11,500-8800 B.P. in central Texas (Collins 1995:381-383). The Southern
Great Plains were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom, and other complex peoples between
approximately 11,500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt
(1980) suggests an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic
artifacts include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type
points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of
the people who made them (e.g., Wenke 1990:201). Within Texas’ political boundaries, Meltzer
and Bever (2007) have documented the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts
associated with the Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and
ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin et al. 1973). Folsom artifacts are
6

fairly common in central Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been found south of Pavo
Real in Bexar County (Hester 1995:434-435).
Most Paleoindian finds in central Texas have consisted of surface lithic scatters on upland terraces
and ridges (Black 1989b:25, 1989c:48). A few Paleoindian components deeply buried in alluvium
have been discovered, such as the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), the Berger Bluff site
(Brown 1987; 2006), Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989), the Wilson-Leonard site (Collins
et al. 1993), and at excavations of the Richard Beene site (Thoms et al. 1996). A well-documented
Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains just northeast of the Project Area is the
McLean site in Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites
in the area include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and
the Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby
containing a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County
(Wormington 1957). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes three sites that have high-integrity
Paleoindian components resting on stable landforms: Kincaid Rockshelter, Horn Shelter, and
Wilson-Leonard. In addition, a late Paleoindian component with apparent high integrity has also
been reported at the St. Mary’s Hall site in Bexar County (Hester 1990:14-17; 1995:435). By far,
the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope,
and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological
shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
Collins (1995:383) dates the Early Archaic from 8800 to 6000 B.P. in central Texas, with three
divisions based on projectile point types. The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is
approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman 1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer
more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P.
The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the
Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the Prehistoric inhabitants (McKinney 1981). While
the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big
game hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central
Texas, such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
7

Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the Reagan County area was used more
frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to a “...decline
of bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains”. Story (1985), however, believes that
population densities were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals
in small bands with “...few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was
based on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as
prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
Collins (1995:383) defines this intermediate interval of the Archaic as lasting from about
6000-4000 B.P. in central Texas. The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from
changes in climate and subsistence is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P.
(Hofman 1989:45-47), and more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson
and Holliday 1986:46). The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period in central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128). The reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry
period (Altithermal) during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and
Hester 1972:338; Story 1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace
site suggest “...a time of ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration”
(Johnson 1995:285). Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the
Southern Great Plains decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. A shift to
concentrated, seasonal nut harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment in
central Texas seems to have occurred (Black 1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of
oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn
processing. He also believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now
began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
Other investigators doubt this conclusion (Black et al. 1997; Goode 1991), but the exact processes
which formed the burned rock middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black
et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated firecracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.

8

The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central Texas, at
least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974). There has
been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison (Prewitt 1981);
however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500 B.P. bison and
burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least in the southern
Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993). Collins (1995:Table 2)
recognizes only one site in central Texas that has a high integrity Middle Archaic component
resting on a stable landform: Landslide.
Late Archaic
Collins (1995:384) dates the final interval of the Archaic in central Texas to approximately 4000
- 800 B.P., while Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the
Southern Plains as 3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify
4500–2000 B.P. as the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe
populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations
remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that
the accumulation of burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however,
excavations at the Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek
midden at 41MS32 (Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995),
a series of middens at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site
in Bandera County (Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features
up to 15 m in diameter were still very much in use. Subsistence is assumed to have become less
specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black
1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains area, and
we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the Late
Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980) further
posits that population in the Reagan County area peaked during the Late Archaic with groups
moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the region
were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes three sites within
central Texas with high-integrity Late Archaic components resting on stable landforms: Anthon,
Loeve-Fox, and 41GT91.

9

Transitional Archaic
A late sub-period or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Weir (1976) defines the Terminal Archaic as 1650-1150 B.P., while
Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as 2250-1250 B.P. This Terminal
Archaic period is represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which
appear to overlap the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976)
believes this marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock
middens and bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and
McGraw 1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did
not disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which
also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in central Texas, while the term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the
Southern Great Plains. Collins (1995:385) recognizes that the commonly used date of 1200 B.P.
for the end of the Archaic and beginning of the Late Prehistoric in central Texas is arbitrary, and
Hester (1995:442) acknowledges the problematic issue of selected tools appearing at both Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites. A series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic
to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the
introduction of pottery to central Texas (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from
about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32). For
example, an excavation of a burial just north of San Antonio (41BX952) revealed an Edwards
point between two lumbar vertebra (Meissner 1991). Sites from the Austin phase include Quinta
Medina (Guderjan et al. 1992, 1993) and Panther Springs Creek, 41BX228 (Black and McGraw
1985). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes eight central Texas sites with high integrity Late
Prehistoric components resting on stable landforms: Loeve-Fox, Frisch Auf!, Smith, Rush,
Mustang Branch, Rocky Branch B, and Currie.
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. This phase is
characterized by the introduction of blade technology, the first ceramics in central Texas
(bone-tempered plainwares), the appearance of Perdiz arrow points, and alternately beveled bifaces
(Black 1989b:32; Huebner 1991:346). Prewitt (1985) and Black (1989b) suggest this technology
10

encroached from north-central Texas. Patterson (1988), however, notes the Perdiz point was first
seen in southeast Texas by about 1350 B.P., and was introduced to the west some 600-700 years
later. Hester (1995:444) recognizes this phase as the “...best documented Late Prehistoric
pattern...” throughout south Texas, with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P.
Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to central Texas resulted from a more
xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the
eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354-355). Sites from this period frequently
have associated bison (Black 1986; Black and McGraw 1985; Henderson 1978; Hulbert 1985;
Prewitt 1974). However, according to Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern
Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison
and vegetal matter, most likely due to the increased alkalinity in the region’s water sources. “It is
interesting to note that a Neo-Indian site characterized by Perdiz points is known from the South
Concho, but do not occur in the Middle Concho area. This might suggest that the Middle Concho
received scant visitation during this period, and insufficient use as to leave detectable archeological
evidence” (Hurt 1980:107).
The only archaeological evidence that domesticated plants were ever introduced in central Texas
is a single corncob found in Late Prehistoric context in Timmeron Rock Shelter (Harris 1985), one
found during excavations in Kyle Rockshelter in Hill County (Jelks 1962:113-114), and Zea mays
remains at the Wild Turkey Midden (41MI8) in Mills County (Holloway 1988:4,8). There is simply
not enough to postulate there was ever a significant presence of maize in the area. Only the arrival
of the Spanish brought significant cultivars to central Texas.
Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in both central Texas and the
Southern Plains in northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European
contact with indigenous groups. Collins (1995:386-387) offers that the Historic period then begins
ca. 260 B.P. in central Texas. However, Hester (1995:450-451) agrees with Adkins and Adkins
(1982:242) when he suggests that the indigenous groups may have been affected by European
influence but we are only able to observe the materials in the archaeological record because the
written accounts simply are not available. He would rather label this largely unknown period
“Protohistoric”. Hofman (1989:91) agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the
time when there were limited European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys,
but no proper history”. The cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely
conditioned by the presence of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous
small groups of Jumanos and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish
intrusions are addressed in many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester
1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers
1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
11

northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and remixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992). The establishment and relocation of Spanish Catholic missions along
the Concho, San Saba, and San Antonio Rivers in the late 1600s and early 1700s induced many
groups to seek the relative comfort and protection offered by a sedentary, apparently well-fed, and
peaceful coexistence (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1988; Habig 1968a,
1968b; Hard et al 1995; Inglis 1964). Although fear of the invading Apache and Comanche
pressured many of the Indians to seek the protection of missions, they were now exposed to the
exploitation of the Spanish (Campbell 1975:2, 1991:346-347).
In the autumn of 1785, a peace treaty with the Comanches signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow to the area to trade for
goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun repair (Poyo and
Hinojosa 1991:125-126). The few Comanches who entered the missions were apparently women
and children who were captured during punitive raids by Spanish soldiers (Campbell and Campbell
1985:26).
Meanwhile, the Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche Indians used the Midland County area as a hunting
ground, raiding local ranches well into the 1800s, but the area remained largely unsettled country
until the nineteenth century. The Comanches continued raiding along the Great Comanche War
Trail from modern-day Oklahoma, southward through modern-day Midland County. In 1839,
Mexican traders dares pass through the area when they blazed the Chihuahua Trail from Big
Spring in modern-day Howard County to Castle Gap in modern-day Upton County, and on to
Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River, in modern-day Pecos County. Later, the Emigrant Road
ran northeastward to the community of Preston in modern-day Grayson County. Otherwise, as
westward expansion continued, numerous wagon trails passed through the area (Leffler 1996).
Despite their considerable achievements in material culture and adaptation to their environment,
the Indians lost their domination of the region to the United States Army and the advancing tide
of white settlers in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1870s, buffalo hunters decimated the large numbers
on the southern Great Plains. By 1879, the Indians had all but removed from Midland County,
except for a few roving Comanches on hunting parties. The last documented skirmish in Midland
County took place in 1879 between a Comanche hunting party and Texas Rangers when the
Rangers came upon the Comanches eating a stolen horse (Leffler 1996).

12

By 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway had built a line through the area, and sheep ranching
became common, followed by cattle ranching. By 1885, there were 300 citizens living in the area
of what was to become Midland County. The city of Midland then became the county seat when
Midland County was cut from lands that were originally a part of Tom Green County. Within the
next few years a newspaper began publication and a schoolhouse was constructed. By 1900, cattle
ranching was the major industry in the county, and this continued until oil was discovered in the
1920s. Prolonged droughts in ly 1900s plagued the growth of ranching and farming, although
cotton farming remained a mainstay of the economy. The oil industry continued to bolster the
county’s economy and population, even through the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the 1940s,
the Midland County South Oil Pool was discovered in the Permian Basin, and the boom was on
(Leffler 1996). Due to new technology in drilling, that boom is now once again being realized in
the early part of the 21st century.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TXMI-Solomon Tower site had not been subjected
to a cultural resources survey. As shown in Figure 3, there had been no cultural resources surveys
nor archaeological sites recorded within one mile of the proposed TXMI-Solomon Cell Tower site
(Atlas 2014).
As of December 3, 2014,although there were only 48 documented archaeological sites in Midland
County, collectively they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited
over the past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian interval, perhaps as long as 11,500 years ago.
Of the 48 sites, 38 have been classified as prehistoric open campsites, ranging in age from the
Paleoindian through the early Historic periods, and many have been found nearby ancient playas.
Notably, the TXMI-Solomon Cell Tower site is situated just north of what appears to be a large
depression that is very likely both an ancient as well existing playa (see Figure 3).
An obsidian point was found at one of those open campsites, an indication of either long distance
trade or travel, likely from either the Querétaro area of central Mexico, the Jemez Mountains near
modern-day Santa Fe, New Mexico, or possibly even from as far away as the Malad source in
Idaho (e.g., Hester 2014). Ground stones were found at least one campsite, suggesting at least a
partial reliance on seeds for subsistence. Quite probably the most well-known of the prehistoric
sites in Midland County is what has become known as the “Midland Man Site”, some ten miles
south of the City of Midland. When the partial human skeletal remains of a female were first
documented at this site the 1950s, they were first interpreted to be perhaps the oldest skeletal
remains in North America. However, subsequent investigations convincingly argue that they are
most probably of Folsom age at the earliest (ca. 9,500 years old), and most probably later (e.g.,
Holliday and Meltzer 1993).

13

Six sites were classified as lithic scatters, once again likely early prehistoric through early historic
in age. Historic components documented in the county are multiple and diverse. Among others,
they include a WWII bombing range and targets, an abandoned school house, the Old Midland
Townsite, 1800s and 1900s farmsteads, house sites, and ranch headquarters, and an early 1900s
trash scatter.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site type,
distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the right-of-way was
conducted, with particular attention given to potential terrace deposits. In accordance with a
general “no collection” policy, cultural material observed on the surface that were of a redundant
nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully
documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for
diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the
interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian
diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to
the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or
other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and
included in this report of investigations.
Soils matrices from six shovel tests were screened through 1/4-inch wire. In accordance with a
designed research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were to not be
collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the
shovel tests were terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). The results of shovel
testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations, and are available upon request. Otherwise, the results are summarized in Table 1.
In addition, digital photographs representing the surveyed area in general, and photos of newly
documented archaeological site 41MD53 were captured, and an accompanying photo log was
maintained (available upon request from TAAI in Martindale, Texas).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the leased 3,600 square-foot tower area and additional 35-foot wide utility
and access right-of-way revealed a cultivated and machine-pushed surface. Six shovel tests placed
within the leased area and within the entryway from Hwy E County Road 140 (Figure 6) generally
revealed disturbed soils in the upper 15-18 centimeters. The only evidence of cultural material
found was on archaeological site 41MD53, described below.

41MD53
Description
41MD53 (Figures 6 and 7) is an ephemeral historic trash scatter situated on a relatively flat upland
area in a field that has been cultivated for at least 60 years. As such, there is no vegetation on the
site other than winter wheat and an occasional weed or grass stem. The exception is along the
northwestern edge of the site where prickly pear cactus is thriving on a recent machine push pile
(see Figures 6
and 7). Surface
visibility in
January 2015 was
estimated at
greater than 90
percent. Surface
elevation at the
site ranges from
2,742-2,743 feet
above mean sea
level (amsl). Soils
on the site are
mapped
as
Amarillo fine
sandy loam (Afa),
commonly found
on 1 to 1 percent
slopes in this area
of Midland
County.

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough examination of the heavily disturbed surface was conducted, and small animal backdirt
piles were examined. The artifacts were predominantly southeast of a machine push pile along the
northwestern edge of the site, and they were dispersed across an area covering roughly 375 square
meters (see Figures 6 and 7).
Artifacts observed were purple, aqua, brown, and clear glass, ferrous metal parts and unidentifiable
fragments, Albany and Bristol glazed stoneware sherds, one rounded red brick fragment, and one
burned rock. In our estimation, the artifacts in total on the site likely represented a very few
bottles, one or two pieces of dinnerware, and perhaps two stoneware vessels. Also observed were
an aluminum can, a plastic water jug, and a few PVC fragments. At Figure 8 is a photo of selected
artifacts.
The only artifacts discovered in any of the six shovel tests placed on and around the site were clear
and aqua bottle glass sherds, and an unidentifiable ferrous metal fragment. All were found in the
upper 10 centimeters, within the plow zone. The results of shovel testing are shown in Table 1.

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been a rarely used trash dump where broken glass and other household
debris was deposited in a vacant field beginning possibly as early as the 1930s. Over time, the trash
deposit was heavily disturbed by repeated plowing, discing, and planting. As shown in Figure 4,
the area was under cultivation in 1963.

18

In our assessment, the site is a heavily disturbed surficial scatter, with at best minimal research
potential. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the TXMI Solomon
Cell Tower and access/utility right-of-way as currently planned be allowed to proceed through the
site, with no further archaeological investigations.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated. The results of a surface survey and
subsequent shovel testing of archaeological site 41MD53 indicated that the cultural material is
generally surficial, and otherwise heavily disturbed.
In addition, there are no known archaeological sites, historic sites, nor historic markers within the
Visual APE of the tower site.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
