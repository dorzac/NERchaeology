MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 5 August 2008, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the approximately 2.26-acre Area of Potential Effect
(APE) for the proposed Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Barge Docks #7 and #8 on Carpenters
Bayou in Houston, Harris County, Texas. Although the undertaking is privately funded and
located on private property, impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As this is a federal
permit, the undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the survey at the request of Stanley
Engineering Company, Inc., on behalf of Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company, in compliance
with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the APE of the proposed barge docks and, if any existed,
to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey within the approximately 2.26-acre APE resulted
in entirely negative findings. No prehistoric or historic age cultural materials were observed on
the surface or within any of the 11 excavated shovel tests conducted within the APE. The
shovel testing regimen revealed an extremely shallow water table within the APE, with water
typically entering excavated shovel tests between 30 and 50 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Due to the shallow water table and the impracticality of excavating deep backhoe trenches
within the wet, sandy matrix, only shovel tests were conducted over the APE.
Based on the negative findings, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
find should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of
the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
approximately 2.26-acre Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the proposed Houston Fuel Oil
Terminal Barge Docks #7 and #8 on Carpenters Bayou in Houston, Harris County, Texas
(Figures 1 and 2). Although the undertaking is privately funded and located on private property,
impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will require
a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As this is a federal permit, the undertaking is also
regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Horizon conducted the survey at the request of Stanley Engineering Company, Inc.,
on behalf of Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company, in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA.
The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any archeological sites were located
within the APE of the proposed barge docks and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the approximately 2.26-acre APE, and the production of a report suitable
for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s
Principal Investigator.
Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technician) conducted the field
investigations on 5 August 2008.
The survey of the approximately 2.26-acre APE entailed intensive surface inspection
and subsurface shovel testing. Due to the presence of an extremely shallow water table within
the APE, backhoe trenching within the soupy wet sands of the APE was impractical and, as
such, was not implemented. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 to 3 shovel tests per acre for projects of this size. As such, a
total of 4 to 7 shovel tests were required to meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon
exceeded these minimum standards by conducting a total of 11 shovel tests over the APE.
The intensive cultural resources survey within the approximately 2.26-acre APE resulted
in entirely negative findings. No prehistoric or historic age cultural materials were observed on
the surface or within any of the 11 excavated shovel tests conducted within the APE. The

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The approximately 2.26-acre APE of the proposed Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Barge
Docks #7 and #8 is located approximately 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) west of where Carpenters
Bayou enters Buffalo Bayou in Harris County, Texas (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on
the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Highlands, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see
Figure 1). The undertaking will consist of the construction of two 30-x-60-foot barge docks on
Carpenters Bayou, access bridges to each dock, and pipe racks along each access bridge (see
Figures 1 and 2). The APE of the westernmost dock and access bridge totals approximately
0.09 acres, while the APE of the easternmost dock and access bridge totals approximately 0.12
acres. Portions of the area between the 2 docks and access bridges may also be utilized for
dredge material necessary for the construction project. This area between the 2 docks and
access bridges measures approximately 2.05 acres, resulting in the overall APE total of 2.26
acres.
Generally speaking, the bulk of the construction for the undertaking will occur within the
channel of Carpenters Bayou or within adjacent wetlands, thereby necessitating the USACE
permit for the project. Only small portions of the undertaking necessary for connecting the
access bridges to dry land are being constructed on dry uplands wherein an archeological
survey was feasible. For reference, engineering plans of the project design depicting areas of
water, wetlands, and uplands is provided in Figure 3. On-site photographs of the APE are
provided in Figures 4 through 7.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

Currently, the APE consists primarily of natural wooded areas along the banks of
Carpenters Bayou (Figures 4 though 7). It is covered with stands of pine, yaupon, Chinese
tallow, and American beauty berry trees. The understory consists of very dense underbrush
composed of a variety of vines, including green briar. The only obvious modern impacts within
the APE consist of the deposition of rubble along the southern extent of the APE, just north of
the roadway seen in Figures 1 and 2. This rubble appears to have been deposited to build up
an elevated area above the floodplain of Carpenters Bayou for modern development.
Immediately upon moving north from the roadway seen in Figures 1 and 2, the rubble forms a
steep slope down to the natural, low-lying terrace above Carpenters Bayou (Figure 6).

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The approximately 2.26-acre APE is situated along the south bank of Carpenters Bayou.
As stated earlier, the southern extent of the APE, just north of the roadway seen in Figures 1
and 2, consists of rubble deposits that appear to have been placed at this location to build up an
elevated area above the floodplain of Carpenters Bayou for modern development. Immediately
upon moving north from the roadway, the rubble forms a steep slope down to the natural, lowlying terrace above Carpenters Bayou. This low-lying terrace is moderately undulating with
pockets of wetland areas along the banks of the bayou. Surface elevation ranges from
approximately 0 to 20 feet above mean sea level, with the highest areas being on the elevated
rubble deposits and the lowest being adjacent to Carpenters Bayou (USGS 1982). The property
drains to the north into Carpenters Bayou, which empties into Buffalo Bayou approximately 2.8
kilometers (1.7 miles) to the east. From this confluence, Buffalo Bayou flows a short distance to
the northeast before meeting up with the San Jacinto River on the western edge of Burnet Bay.

SOILS

A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the approximately 2.26-acre APE. They are
presented in Table 1 below (NRCS 2008). Views of the typical soils encountered within shovel
tests within the APE, as well as the shallow water table, are presented in Figures 8 and 9.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 kilometers (km) (124 miles) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad
terms, much of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between
the Southern Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995;
Story 1990). Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of Southeast Texas. These 2 sub-regions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the
inland sub-region has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast
Texas comprises a zone about 25 kilometers (km) (16 miles) inland from the coast that covers
the area influenced by gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable
ecological variability characterizes this sub-region, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes,
wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland sub-region also encompasses
considerable ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney
woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PaleoIndian Period (10,000 to 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
3.2

Archaic Period (5000 BC to AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

12

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Barge Docks #7 and
#8 on Carpenters Bayou, Harris County, Texas

stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of ground stone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.
3.3

Early Ceramic Period (AD 100 to 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
129 km (80 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of
a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods
(Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility
ware throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown
Plain for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.
3.4

Late Prehistoric Period (AD 600 to 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in
Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland sub-region along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been
established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points
throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

Protohistoric Period (AD 1500 to 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco/Karankawa, and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson et al. 1993; Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in
identifying Historic Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and
possibly Fresno and Cuney points after AD 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites
are usually identified by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types
of pottery.
3.6

Historic Period (post AD 1700 )

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
The Atakapas lived on the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers. In 1746, they occupied
2 villages on opposite sides of the Neches near the site of present-day Beaumont. Orcoquiza
Indians occupied the area from the Neches River to halfway between the Trinity and the Brazos.
Six burial mounds have been discovered at Joseph Grigsby’s plantation at Port Neches on the
west bank of the Neches 12 miles below Beaumont, and pottery sherds have been found at

been attributed to migration and/or smallpox epidemics; most were gone by the 1820s, when
the first EuroAmerican settlers arrived.
The French and Spanish disputed ownership of the area during the 18th century.
Spanish claims were based on the 1528 expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and
French involvement began with La Salle in 1685. By 1730, French fur traders had crossed the
lower Sabine to trade with the Orcoquizas on the Trinity River; however, the area was rarely
visited by EuroAmerican traders because it was bounded on the east by unfordable rivers and
bayous and on the north by the Big Thicket. To prevent French penetration, the Spanish
established San Agustín de Ahumada Presidio and Nuestra Señora de la Luz Mission near the
mouth of the Trinity in 1756. In 1777, Antonio Gil Ibarbo conducted an expedition to investigate
the English presence in Spanish territory, and, in 1785, José de Evia camped at Sabine Pass
and mapped Sabine Lake and the Sabine and Neches rivers. By 1803, when the US acquired
Louisiana, the area of Orange County was under Spanish control as part of the Atascosito
District. In conjunction with filibustering efforts to discourage Spanish shipping after 1816, the
area provided a path for slave smuggling between Louisiana, Point Bolivar, and the Sabine
River until the 1830s. Pirate Jean Laffite maintained a slave barracks on the Sabine River
10 miles north of the site of present Orange to house black slaves in transit. In 1821,
filibustering efforts ceased when the Treaty of Córdova ended Spanish ownership in the region
and made it part of Mexico. Anglo-American colonization subsequently met both hostility and
encouragement from the Mexican government, as settlement efforts brought new families to the
area from 1821 to 1836.
Specific to the current project, the proposed barge docks and access bridges are located
on the south bank of Carpenters Bayou, approximately 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) west of where
Carpenters Bayou enters Buffalo Bayou near the San Jacinto Battleground State Park.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (2008), Carpenters Bayou was possibly named for
David Carpenter who was granted land along its banks in 1824.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
indicated no previously recorded archeological sites within a 1.2-km (1.0-mile) radius of the
current approximately 2.26-acre APE (Figure 10). There is 1 historical marker titled “Bayou
Bend” located approximately 1.0 km (0.6 miles) northeast of the APE. Its text reads as follows:
American heritage collection in mansion built 1927 by William Clifford (1875-1930), Ima
(b. 1882), and Mike Hogg (1885-1941), children of first native Texan Governor James
Stephen Hogg (1851-1906) and his wife Sarah Stinson. Will Hogg, attorney and
businessman, originator of a student loan program in numerous Texas colleges, 1914-16
chairman of Board of Regents of the University of Texas, developed River Oaks, where
Buffalo Bayou makes noted bend. Mike Hogg, Texas legislator (1927-31), joined sister in
establishing at the University of Texas the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health. Miss Ima
Hogg founded (1913) the Houston Symphony and (1929) Child Guidance Center of
Houston; also served 1943-49 on Houston School board; engaged in restoration and
preservation, creating Varner-Hogg State Park in West Columbia and Winedale Inn
complex in Fayette County. Miss Hogg and her brothers used their home in its 14-acre
setting of natural beauty to house paintings and American memorabilia, entertaining
national and international personages. Their collections span three centuries, from about
1650, filling 19 rooms. In 1957 Miss Hogg gave Bayou Bend, its park, and its treasures to
the Museum of Fine Arts of Houston (THC 2008).

No previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, or historical markers are located
within or immediately adjacent to the APE. According to the Atlas, at least half of the APE lies
within an expansive area previously surveyed for cultural resources in 1994 in response to a
USACE permitted project (Figure 10). Aside from producing negative findings within the current
APE (determined by the lack of documented sites within the denoted survey area), no other
details concerning the previous survey were available on the Atlas database.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the approximately
2.26-acre APE on 6 August 2008. This was accomplished by walking random transects over
the dry, upland extents of the property and consisted of subsurface shovel testing and surface
inspection. Wetland areas with standing water within the APE (which were numerous), as well
as the extents of the proposed barge docks into the channel of Carpenters Bayou, were not
assessed. Due to the presence of an extremely shallow water table within the upland portions
of the APE, backhoe trenching within the soupy wet sands of the APE was impractical and, as
such, was not implemented. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 to 3 shovel tests per acre for projects of this size. As such, a
total of 4 to 7 shovel tests were required to meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon
exceeded these minimum standards by conducting a total of 11 shovel tests over the APE. All
excavated matrices from these shovel tests were screened through 6.0-millimeter (mm) (0.25inch) mesh.
A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. If any non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) were observed on the surface or within
shovel tests, they were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, historic materials maker’s marks, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and further
documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel
tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed
for every shovel test, and included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. A
handheld GPS unit utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum was used
to record pertinent location data. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented in
Figures 11 and 12. Shovel test data are provided in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey within the approximately 2.26-acre APE resulted
in entirely negative findings. No prehistoric or historic age cultural materials were observed on
the surface or within any of the 11 excavated shovel tests conducted within the APE. The
shovel testing regimen revealed an extremely shallow water table within the APE, with water
typically entering excavated shovel tests between 30 and 50 cmbs. Due to the shallow water
table and the impracticality of excavating deep backhoe trenches within the wet, sandy matrix,
only shovel tests were conducted over the APE.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative findings, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
find should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of
the discovery.
