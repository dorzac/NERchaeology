MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an intensive pedestrian and backhoe trenching survey for Michael
Baker, Jr., Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Fort Worth
District of the proposed bridge replacement project along FM 1885 at Dry Creek in Parker
County. The cultural resources investigation consists of an intensive survey of approximately
400 feet of proposed bridge replacement and road rebuild along FM 1885. The scope of the
proposed construction is described as replacing the existing structure and approaches with
approximately 400 feet (0.9183 acre) of road rebuild. The proposed bridge will be a single-span
bridge with two 12-foot drive lanes and 8-foot shoulders. Metal beam guard fences will be added
to treat the bridge approach ends. Signing, delineators, and pavement markings will be included.
The work will be contained to the existing right-of-way, including a temporary haul road on the
upstream side of the bridge impacting approximately 1,000 square feet (0.0275 acre) of channel
(information supplied by client). The area of potential effect (APE) consists of the entire right-ofway, measuring 100 feet wide, and impacts should not exceed 3 feet deep except at the bridge
where impacts may go as deep as 25 feet. Total area surveyed is 0.9458 acres. This area
included the APE, based on construction plan schematics, as well as 250 ft along the cutbank of
Dry Creek on each side of the bridge location.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this construction project area was to
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists conducted fieldwork on January 30 and 31 of 2008 under GeoMarine project # 30575.00.06. Four backhoe trenches and seven shovel tests were dug within the
APE, resulting in the documentation of no new archeological sites. Three historic localities and
one prehistoric isolate locality were identified during the examination of the Dry Creek cutbank.
Three of these cultural resources lie outside the APE and all are recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Therefore, it is recommended that the proposed FM 1885 bridge replacement at Dry
Creek be found as having no effect on historic archeological properties in the APE and
construction may proceed. All notes, forms, and photographs obtained from the project are on
file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas
at Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive cultural resources pedestrian survey within
approximately 2 acres along Farm to Market (FM) road 1885 for the proposed bridge replacement
project at Dry Creek in Parker County in northcentral Texas (Figure 1). Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI),
under subcontract with Michael Baker, Jr., Inc. (GMI project # 30575.00.06), conducted survey
of this road-widening project in the Fort Worth District of the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT). The project consists of an intensive survey of approximately 400 feet
(ft) of proposed bridge replacement and road rebuild along FM 1885 at Dry Creek. The scope of
the proposed construction is described as replacing the existing structure and approaches with
approximately 400 ft (0.9183 acre [ac]) of road rebuild. The proposed bridge will be a singlespan bridge with two 12-ft drive lanes and 8-ft shoulders. Metal beam guard fences will be added
to treat the bridge approach ends. Signing, delineators, and pavement markings will be included.
The work will be contained to the existing right-of-way, including a temporary haul road on the
upstream side of the bridge impacting approximately 1,000 square ft (0.0275 ac) of channel,
based on information supplied by the client. The area of potential effect (APE) consists of the
entire right-of-way, measuring 100 ft wide, and impacts should not exceed 3 ft deep except at the
bridge where impacts may go as deep as 25 ft, for a total area surveyed of 0.9458 ac.
The cultural resources work for this project was undertaken on January 30â31, 2008, in order to
satisfy federal requirements governing cultural resources treatment under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470
et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
[42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852]. TxDOT, the ultimate client, created under
enabling state legislation and thus a political entity of the State of Texas, must comply with the
Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas];
therefore, the cultural resources investigation was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4789.
The purpose of the pedestrian survey was to identify and inventory all cultural resources
contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). GMI conducted the intensive pedestrian survey along the banks of Dry Creek,
250 ft (76 m) on each side of the FM 1885 bridge and on the embankments on each side of FM
1885 leading to the Dry Creek bridge (Figure 2). The project area is composed of existing ROW
for the FM 1885 bridge at Dry Creek.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located in the northwest quarter of Parker County, approximately 0.85 miles
southeast of the community of Adell on FM 1885. This chapter summarizes the modern natural
environmental conditions of the survey area by providing information about the topography and
hydrology, geology, soils, climate, and flora and fauna.

TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
Parker County is part of the Texan biotic province, defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces, and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. The project area lies on Dry Creek, which drains into Rock Creek, and
ultimately into the Brazos River. The project area falls inside the eastern edge of the Western
Cross Timbers subregion of the Oak Woods and Prairies region of northcentral Texas (Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department 2004).
Topographically, the Oak Woods and Prairies region consists of gently rolling to hilly terrain, and
vegetation consists of oak-hickory forest interdigitated with tall-grass prairies. Topography of the
main belt of the Western Cross Timbers subregion, in which the project area is located, rolls
gently (Dyksterhuis 1948). The main belt also consists of sandy soils with an overstory of post
oak and blackjack oak. Prehistorically, the understory was probably dominated by the mid grass
little bluestem, and to a lesser extent, by the tall grasses big bluestem and Indiangrass; however,
Dyksterhuis (1948) proposes that grazing by domestic livestock has altered the vegetation types
and their distributions.

GEOLOGY
The project area is underlain by Holocene alluvial deposits above the Lower Cretaceous Glen
Rose Formation, consisting mostly of limestone clays and sand, and the Twin Mountains
Formation, made of claystone and sandstone. The Glen Rose Formation varies between 40 and
200 ft thick, and the Twin Mountains Formation is approximately 150 ft thick (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1988).
5

SOILS
Three soil units are mapped within the project area (Greenwade et al. 1977). Frequently flooded
Yahola and Bunyan soils lie on either side of Dry Creek. Above the cutbank east of Dry Creek
are found occasionally flooded Bunyan fine sandy loams. To the west of Dry Creek on FM 1885
are Duffau and Weatherford soils with eroded 2 to 5 percent slopes.

CLIMATE
Parker County has a subtropical climate, with dry winters and hot and humid summers.
Temperatures in Parker County can change rapidly, but average around 13Â° Celsius (C; 56Â°
Fahrenheit [F]) during the winter months and 35Â°C (95Â°F) in the summer. Weatherford generally
has a freeze-free period of 225 days each year. Parker County averages 82 centimeters (cm; 32
inches [in]) of precipitation annually, with April and May being the wettest months (Greenwade
et al. 1977).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The predominant trees within the Cross Timbers ecoregion of Parker County include post oak and
blackjack oak with appearances of elm, pecan, and hackberry in riparian zones. This areaâs
herbaceous plants consist of beggarweed, perennial lespedeza, wild bean, greenbrier, little
bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, Texas wintergrass, cheatgrass, grama, Texas
cupgrass, and purpletop grasses (Greenwade et al. 1977; Griffith et al. 2004).
Parker County is home to a variety of animal species. These include birds such as quail, dove,
meadowlark, field sparrow, wild turkey, duck, geese, rail, and heron (Greenwade et al. 1997).
The Brazos River basin is home to over 93 fish species, of which a fair number, including chub
and catfish, and smaller fish like darters and minnows, likely inhabit Dry Creek. Crayfish and
several species of mussels have also been reported inhabiting the Brazos River (Benke and
Cushing 2005).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
This chapter includes two sections: Previous Archeological Investigations and Regional Culture
History. Previous Archeological Investigations provides an overview of the archeological
research conducted within Parker County, especially in the immediate vicinity of the project area.
The history of archeological research in this region spans the late 1800s to the present and
includes tens if not hundreds of both small- and large-scale studies. The purpose of this section is
not to provide an overview or summary of the entire chronology of the research conducted in the
region, but to provide information relative to archeological investigations and their findings
within the vicinity of the proposed project area. Regional Culture History, based on the regional
research projects, provides the historical overview generally accepted by the professional
archeological community.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to identify previously recorded archeological
sites within and near the present project corridor. The nearest sites to the project area are historic
military sites related to activity at Fort Wolters, located more than 3 miles west of the Dry Creek
bridge. Although the sites atlas lists 103 archeological sites for Parker County, most are clustered
around Lake Mineral Wells State Park and Fort Wolters in the northwest portion of the county.
These areas are also the locations of the two largest-scale archeological investigations in the
county. Except for a burial removal from 41PR12 on the south side of Burgess Creek north of
Anneta, Texas, and NRHP eligibility testing of four sites (41PR44, 41PR49, 41PR77, and
41PR90) at Fort Wolters, few archeological investigations beyond the survey phase have been
undertaken.

REGIONAL CULTURE HISTORY
Because most of the projects within this area have been limited to survey or test excavations,
knowledge of the prehistory of this region is very limited relative to other surrounding areas that
have been more thoroughly investigated. As Thurmond et al. (1981:35â37) and Thoms and
Montgomery (1977) have aptly noted, previous investigations within the central Brazos River
basin have revealed a complex, but poorly understood, array of cultural expressions that range in
age from the Late Pleistocene to the present.
The earliest attempt at cultural synthesis within the area was Kriegerâs (1946) definition of the
Henrietta focus. Although this formulation was based upon an inadequate recognition of
important cultural-stratigraphic units within the alluvial terrace deposits of the Harrell site
(41YN1), Krieger presented an early model for a Plains-oriented adaptation to Northcentral Texas
during the Late Prehistoric period (post-A.D. 1200).
Prior to the Late Prehistoric period, very little is known concerning the prehistoric adaptations
within the central Brazos River basin. Diagnostic points of the Paleo-Indian and Late Archaic
periods are commonly found associated with lithic scatters, but little is known about the nature of
the adaptations or their temporal framework. The absence of Early and Middle Archaic
components has also been of special interest to researchers in the area. Whether this absence is
related to a withdrawal from the area during a drier period following the end of the Pleistocene or
to problems in site detection for this time period has recently been addressed by investigations at
the proposed South Bend Reservoir in Throckmorton and Stephens counties (Saunders et al.
1992).
A report concerning the archeology of the central Brazos River basin (Brown et al. 1987) aptly
summarizes the history of archeological investigations within the drainage and the culturehistorical framework for the Brazos drainage below Parker County. Another recent report (Peter
and McGregor 1988), although concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin,
summarizes the history of investigations within the adjacent area to the east and provides a
culture-historical framework that is perhaps applicable to the Parker County area. Although the
prehistoric chronological framework for Northcentral Texas is not well developed, the available
data do allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). A brief summary of the
prehistoric human adaptations exhibited during these periods is presented below.

Prehistoric Era
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the central Brazos River basin is known primarily through the
presence of diagnostic projectile points in surface collections or from limited excavation of
primary site contexts. Representative sites of this period include Horn Shelters 1 and 2 (Watt
1968, 1978), the Ballew site (Watt and Agogino 1968), and the Acton site (Blaine et al. 1968).
Unfortunately, the Horn Shelters have provided the only data for this period that exhibit definite
contextual integrity. They seem to contain in situ Plainview material associated with a
radiocarbon date of 7310 B.C. (Agogino, in Leonhardy 1966:23). Charcoal and snail shells from
below the Plainview level have in turn yielded dates of 10,785 Â± 500 B.P. (SMU-762), 10,310 Â±
150 B.P. (Tx-1997), 10,300 Â± 130 B.P. (Tx-1998), 9980 Â± 370 B.P. (Tx-1722), and 9500 Â± 200 B.P.
(Tx-1830) (Watson and Brown 1987:5-4). Of other Paleo-Indian material in the area, the Ballew
site appears to represent a deflated, late Paleo-Indian occupation, and the Acton site contains a
mixed assemblage of projectile points that include types dating to the Late Paleo-Indian horizon
on typological grounds. Consequently, current knowledge of the settlement subsistence strategies
used by these early occupants is extremely limited. Whether these people focused on the hunting
of now extinct, big game species or had adopted a more generalized foraging subsistence system
remains to be documented.
Knowledge of the Archaic period in the central Brazos River basin is limited by the lack of data
from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods.
Components of these periods have either been buried deeply within the floodplain alluvium or
destroyed by erosional processes. Although Watson and Brown (1987:5-5 to 5-8) attempt to
apply the various chronological models for Central Texas (Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976) to the
central Brazos drainage, neither model is appropriate given the present state of knowledge. An
adequate characterization of the adaptations during this lengthy period is even more difficult. It is
apparent that a generalized hunting and gathering adaptation predominated throughout the
Archaic; however, it is not clear how this adaptation changed through time or if hypothesized
population increases for the Late Archaic period (Skinner et al. 1978) are indeed real.
The Late Prehistoric period in the central Brazos River basin is marked first by the appearance of
arrow points and subsequently by the introduction of ceramics. Common site types are
rockshelters, open sites, and cemeteries. Most researchers (e.g., Lynott 1977; Watson and Brown
1987) recognize an early (Austin) and late (Toyah) phase for this period. The early phase (A.D.
700â1200) is characterized by Scallorn and Alba arrow points, sand- and grog-tempered ceramics
appearing around A.D. 1000, and a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late
Archaic period. The late phase (A.D. 1200â600) reflects a Southern Plains influence with the
appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various unstemmed triangular points
(e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of horticulture and the
procurement of bison also appears in sites of this period.
Recent investigation of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) in Dallas
County has resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period in Northcentral Texas. The
Cobb-Pool site has yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba arrow points, grog-tempered
ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was
occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the
site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive
change appears to have occurred during the early phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Whether
the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change
remains to be documented.
9

The Protohistoric period is not well documented within the central Brazos River drainage.
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the earlier part of the
period in Northcentral Texas. Although several named Protohistoric archeological complexes
(Norteno, Garza, Tierra Blanca, Wheeler-Edwards) have been defined for the regions to the west
of the Trinity River basin, no archeological sites affiliated with these complexes are known to
exist. Historically, various bands of the Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, Lipan Apache, Kiowa, and
Comanche likely traversed the area, but exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric
data are almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a
limited number of sites, no Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and
characterizations of the Native American adaptations during this time period in Northcentral
Texas are conjectural at best.

Historic Occupation/Utilization
By the late 1840s when European Americans began to settle the region, Kiowa and Comanche
groups controlled the area. Other groups, such as the Tawakoni, Waco, and several Caddoan
groups were also present between 1778 and 1850 (Reese 1961; Watson and Brown 1987:510), and most likely, Tonkawan peoples remained as late as 1870 (Jelks 1970; Stephenson
1970). Aside from the Kiowa and Comanche, these groups, who were being forced westward
by the influx of Euro-American settlers, were relatively short-term visitors to the region.
An eruption of malaria in neighboring Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties, as well as
establishment of the Butterfield Overland Mail route during the early 1850s promoted
immigration into the area. In 1855, Isaac Parker and 224 other settlers petitioned the state
legislature to form a new county. Parker County was formed from portions of Bosque and
Navarro counties in December of that same year, and Weatherford was designated as the county
seat (Echeverria 2002). Weatherford was incorporated in 1858. In addition to serving as the
county seat, Weatherford offered refuge to county residents during frequent raids by Native
American groups, which continued until the early 1870s. By 1880, the Texas and Pacific
Railway extended to Weatherford, and two additional rail lines were introduced to the town by
the early 1890s. The transportation network helped establish the town as a shipping and retail
hub for the county (Minor 2004). For most of its history, the economy of Parker County has been
based in farming and ranching. Cotton, corn, wheat, and cattle were major products between
1870 and the Great Depression, and peach and watermelon agriculture became popular during the
first decades of the twentieth century. After World War II, a more diversified system of
agriculture that included peanuts, hay, various fruits and vegetables, livestock, and dairy cattle
was adopted. Oil production also became economically significant for Parker County by the mid1960s (Echeverria 2002). Construction of major highways and farm roads helped Weatherford
retain its position as a retail and shipping center for the county and encouraged growth in the
county as bedroom communities for the city of Fort Worth to the east (Echeverria 2002; Minor
2004).

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all previous cultural resources investigations in the vicinity
of the project area. This information was used to determine the locations of all known
archeological sites, standing structures, National Register properties, and National Historic
Landmarks that might be situated near the project area. The results of the research were used to
guide the field methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be
encountered, and to locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological deposits.
The data also served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could be
evaluated for significance.
The archival research and literature review were conducted by the Project Archeologist. Site
records maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas) and
the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin were
consulted to obtain information on previous investigations and known sites within or near the
current project areas. These efforts found no previously recorded sites within several miles of the
project area; however, no previous cultural resources surveys had been conducted in the area,
either. Early historic maps were consulted to form a background for the history of the area. An
1889 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) map of Parker County, printed in 1893, was consulted to
determine the locations of potential historic sites. This map revealed that the section of FM 1885
examined for this project did not exist in the late nineteenth century, although it appears that
much of FM 1885 heading southeast toward Weatherford overlaps with a road or trail present in
1889 (Figure 3). Also missing from the Parker County 1889 map is the town of Adell. Holland
(1937) reports that although settlement of Adell, which is located approximately 0.5 mile
southeast of the project area, began in the late 1880s and a grocery store was operating in the
town by 1889, the townâs post office did not arrive until 1890. Postal service to this area,
however, ceased in 1904.
A 1959 USGS map of the Adell quadrangle shows that the section FM 1885 absent from the 1889
map is in place at the time of that survey. The TxDOT Bridge Inventory and Inspection File for
the Dry Creek bridge on FM 1885 indicates that the bridge was built in 1955, which may also be
the construction year for this segment of the road.

Investigations of the FM 1885 bridge project area involved an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel
testing, and backhoe trenching by GMI archeologists. Survey of the project area included a
surface examination of the entire right-of-way, which comprises the APE. The shoulders and
grassy areas within 9 m (30 ft) of each side of FM 1885 extending 76 m (250 ft) from each end of
the bridge were studied. In addition, survey encompassed both sides of Dry Creek beneath the
bridge and along the creek 76 m (250 ft) from the bridge in both directions, paying special
attention to the cutbanks where eroding features and artifacts might be visible (see Figure 2).
GMI archeologists excavated a total of seven shovel tests. Two shovel tests were dug to gain a
preliminary sample of the areaâs sediments and site potential prior to the backhoe trenching.
Another five shovel tests were dug in areas not accessible to the backhoe, including four below
the bridge, on the west bank of Dry Creek. Each shovel test was dug to at least 80 cm below
surface, unless bedrock was reached first. These units were hand-excavated with shovels and the
fill was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth. A shovel test survey form was used
to record soil matrix descriptions and artifact findings for each excavated unit. Four backhoe
trenches were also dug for this survey. The trenches were placed at each of the bridgeâs four
corners, positioned as close to the bridge as the terrain would allow (Figure 4). Each trench
measured 4.6 m (15 ft) long and 3 m (10 ft) deep. Once dug, the trenches were profiled and
photographed. A sample of sediments from each visible sedimentary level was also screened
through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth. All trenches and shovel test units were backfilled
after the final recording process was complete.
The Project Archeologist maintained daily field notes that detailed the investigations and field
observations. Each crewmember was responsible for recording the results of each shovel test
excavated by that individual. Shovel test locations were recorded using a Trimble global
positioning system (GPS) unit. These points were corrected using base station files from the
Weatherford base station, operated by TxDOT and converted into shapefiles using Pathfinder 3.1
software. Digital maps plotting the survey areas and shovel tests were created using ESRI
ArcMap 9.1. Digital photographs were taken to record the general topography of these areas as
well as the activities related to the cultural resources investigations. The Project Archeologist
maintained a log of all photographs taken during the project.
A site was defined when materials were recovered from two or more shovel tests or, for surficial
materials, when five or more prehistoric artifacts were found in a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Any
cultural materials not meeting these criteria were referred to as localities.
All material, notes, and photographs obtained from this project are on file at TARL, University of
Texas at Austin.

RESULTS

The four trenches and six of the seven shovel tests were placed within the project area, either
adjacent to FM 1885 or below the bridge, along Dry Creek. The other shovel test (#4) was placed
just southwest of the project area, on the west bank of Dry Creek. The cutbanks, on each side of
the bridge, were also examined in order to obtain a better view of the areaâs depositional setting.
All cultural materials found during this survey were outside of the project area, along the
cutbanks.

RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

Trenching
Trenches #1 and #3, placed north of FM 1885, show evidence of repeated alluvial depositional
episodes, whereas Trenches #2 and #4, positioned south of the road, exhibit signs of a more stable
environment. Trenches #1 and #3 were also located closer to Dry Creek than Trenches #2 and
#4, because terrain and the presence of other recently constructed features (e.g., driveways,
culverts, fences, etc.) forced their placement farther from creek. None of the trenches displayed
evidence of historic or prehistoric cultural activity.

Trench #1
This trench was placed approximately 25 m east of the Dry Creek bridge, on the north side of FM
1885. Except for the sandy loam sediments in the first 50â60 cm, all of the sediments from this
trench consisted of sand (Table 2). The trenchâs profile indicated that at least three flood events
occurred, as represented by brown layers overlying lighter-colored soil zones (Figure 5). These
events were probably not very severe, as none of the layers displayed rocks or other large
materials.

Trench #4
Trench #4 was approximately 50 m west of the Dry Creek bridge, on the south side of FM 1885.
Like Trench #3, this trench displayed reddish sediments in its middle levels, but the boundaries
between layers were much more diffuse (Table 5, Figure 8). An olive yellow sand appeared in
the bottom 10 cm of this trench that was not seen elsewhere.

Shovel Testing
GMI archeologists excavated seven shovel tests for this project. Two were dug west of the Dry
Creek bridge in order to obtain a preliminary sample of the area prior to the excavation of the
trenches. Another shovel test was excavated near the bridgeâs southeast corner in order to assess
an area that the backhoe could not access. The final four shovel tests were dug on the west bank
of Dry Creek, beneath the bridge.

The three shovel tests placed on high ground above the creek cut were excavated to 80â100 cm
below surface (bs). The four shovel tests on the creek bank reached bedrock impasses at 50 cm
bs or higher. Along the creek bank, the shovel tests produced sand sediments. Above the creek,
sediments consisted mostly of sandy loam.
Shovel Test #5, located on Dry Creekâs west bank, north of the bridge, produced a broken
Edwards chert cobble. This cobble was found in the shovel testâs first 10 cm. The cobble is
small (< 5 cm long) and the breakage appears to be natural. None of the other shovel tests
produced any material that may have cultural use.
The shovel tests along FM 1885 (#1, #2, and #6) all had differing soil descriptions, but the
sediments found in the shovel tests along Dry Creek (#3, #4, #5, and #7) were generally uniform.
Shovel Test #1 contained a dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay loam A horizon through its upper 15 cm,
followed by a yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam until reaching 80 cm bs. At this point, a
reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy loam appeared with several limestone gravels.
Shovel Test #2 exhibited an 8-cm thick, brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam A horizon on its top layer.
This was followed by a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy loam layer that persisted until 20
cm bs. The bottom of this shovel test, from 20â80 cm bs, contained a reddish yellow sandy clay
loam.

20

Shovel Test #6, near the bridgeâs southeast corner, had a thin (5 cm), very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2), sandy loam A horizon. Below this layer was a brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam
that lasted to 55 cm bs. At this point, and continuing to the bottom of the shovel test (80 cm bs),
a white (10YR 8/1) sand was found intermixed with the sandy clay loam found in the previous
layer.
Shovel Tests #3, #4, #5, and #7, along the west bank of Dry Creek (Figure 9), all revealed a
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) to light yellow brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam with several pebbles
and small river cobbles through the first 20â35 cm bs. In Shovel Test #3, the next layer (30â
70 cm bs) included a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand before the bedrock was encountered.
Shovel Tests #4 and #5 each had a layer of pale olive (5Y 6/3) mixed with olive yellow (2/5Y
6/8) clay before large cobbles prevented further digging at approximately 45 cm bs. Shovel Test
#7 had a very compact yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sand layer between 30 and 40 cm bs. At
40 cm bs, sandstone rocks appeared in Shovel Test #7.

Locality #1
GMI archeologists found a piece of Edwards chert in Dry Creekâs east cutbank, approximately
1.5 m below the ridge top (Figure 11). This chert piece does not have attributes necessary for a
flake (e.g., bulb of percussion, eraillure scar, etc.), but there does appear to be evidence of edge
use. The flake shatter measures 2.5 cm x 2.0 cm and is 0.5 cm thick. Cortex is present on its
dorsal side.

Figure

11.

Locality #1âchert flake shatter found in cutbank, facing east

Figure 11. Locality #1âchert flake shatter found in cutbank, facing east.

The chert piece was found in a layer of the cutbank that exhibits evidence for a high flow period,
as several rocks and other larger materials are found in association with this sandy layer. Thus, it
is likely that this chert piece was transported from an upstream location. Therefore, even if this
material proved to have cultural origins, it would not have site integrity.

Locality #2
Locality #2 consists of several pieces of corrugated metal (Figure 12) and other metal scraps
located 50 m north of the Dry Creek bridge, on the slope east of the creek. None of the materials
at this locality has datable markings, but the corroded condition of the materials suggests an older
date, possibly 50 years or more.

23

Figure

Locality #2âcorrugated metal, facing southwest

Locality #3
A circular, galvanized metal cattle trough with long (> 2 m) pieces of corrugated metal and wood
scraps (Figure 13) was found at the top of the cutbank, approximately 60 m north of the Dry
Creek bridge. It appears that the trough once sat on the edge of the cutbank, but erosion has
caused the trough to fall downslope and into disrepair. The materials at this locality have no
datable markings, but the corrosion of the metal and the weathered condition of all the associated
materials suggest an older date, possibly even 50 years or more, for this locality. Nonetheless,
this localityâs integrity is not intact due to the poor condition of the trough and other materials.

Locality #4
Locality #4 consists of the FM 1885 bridge at Dry Creek (Figure 14). This bridge has a beam
(girder), continuous span design. Two sets of three upright steel girders hold up the concrete span
in the center. The bridgeâs base on the west end is reinforced with a wall of limestone slabs,
positioned horizontally on top of one another and cemented with concrete. Concrete also
reinforces the base of this wall, but erosion is undercutting the base and jeopardizing its stability.
Large, local limestone boulders help support the cutbank on the spanâs east end. The bridge
measures approximately 170 ft long and 20 ft wide. As mentioned previously, the bridgeâs
construction date is 1955. Consequently, it is more than 50 years old. In addition, its integrity
appears relatively intact.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP evaluations.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to determine
eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39
CFR Part 60].

26

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination of
whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or
more of the above-defined criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources
properties could yield further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research
questions. Therefore, adequate information on site function, context, and chronological
placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal
period, determination of site context and chronological placement of the cultural properties is a
particularly important objective during the inventory process.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Within the vicinity of the proposed FM 1885 bridge replacement at Dry Creek, one prehistoric
locality and three historic localities were identified. The prehistoric locality (#1) and two of the
historic localities (#2 and #3) lie along Dry Creekâs cutbank, outside of the APE and will not be
affected by the proposed project. Regardless, none of these localities retain their integrity. The
prehistoric flake shatter, Locality #1, likely comes from an upstream site; the historic trough and
metal debris, localities #2 and #3, are in disrepair and not necessarily in their original location.
Locality #4, the FM 1885 bridge at Dry Creek, is more than 50 years old, but fails to meet any of
the criteria for placement in the National Register of Historic Places. Consequently, these
localities are recommended not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
or for designation as Texas State Archeological Landmarks.
The area of potential effects (APE) includes the bridge location and its approaches in an area that
measures 400 feet long and 100 feet wide (0.9183 ac) and the 0.0275 ac for the temporary haul
road for a total of 0.9458 ac. No archeological deposits or remains were observed or identified in
any of the shovel test units or backhoe trenches excavated within the APE. The absence of other
cultural resources and any historic properties in the APE precludes any additional work under the
National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800) and the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas.
Therefore, there will be no effect on historic properties and the proposed action is recommended
to proceed.
In the unlikely event that evidence of archeological deposits is encountered during construction,
work within the project area shall immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff shall be
contacted in order to initiate accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the
Programmatic Agreement between TxDOT, Texas Historical Commission (THC), Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation; and the
Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and THC.
