ABSTRACT

On March 12, 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting (MAC) conducted
construction monitoring for the final construction stage of the Gregory-Lincoln Education
Center. These investigations were performed under the terms of a contract between
MAC and the client Houston Independent School District. The project was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4823 in order to satisfy stipulations of the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
The Project Area was located on the USGS Houston Heights, Texas quadrangle
(Figure 1) at the southeast corner of Dallas and Taft. The entire Project Area is contained
within the current school tract which, before demolition, included the building, asphaltpaved parking lots, and grass-covered areas.
Project Archeologist Kelly Schexnayder monitored the excavation of three
concrete footings which went below the select fill. No features or cultural remains were
recovered and no further cultural resource field investigations are recommended for the
Gregory-Lincoln Education Center.

INTRODUCTION

On March 12, 2008 Moore Archeological Consulting (MAC) monitored the
construction excavations occurring at the Gregory-Lincoln Education Center on the
southeast corner of Dallas and Taft Street. The entire Project Area is contained within
the current school tract which, before demolition, included the building, asphalt-paved
parking lots, and grass-covered areas. These investigations were performed under the
terms of a contract between MAC and Houston Independent School District. The project
was conducted under the Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4823 in order to satisfy
stipulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
The objectives of the monitoring investigation were (1) to confirm or deny
through direct archeological field investigations the presence or absence of significant
archeological deposits or features within the Project Area, (2) to adequately document
any remains exposed during construction excavation consistent with the limitations
inherent to construction monitoring, and (3) to ensure that sensitive remains such as
human burials are reported immediately to the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission.

Archeological monitoring was carried out for construction-

related excavations occurring anywhere within the proposed building footprint. The
proportion of the structure footprint subject to monitoring was determined to pertain to
only those footings that go below the select fill. Most of them end in select fill at 3 feet.
As a result, the track hoe excavation of three concrete footings was monitored, the
deepest measuring approximately 3 meters deep into the Pleistocene.
The archeological field results did not identify any locations where significant
archeological remains are preserved.
This report is divided into the following chapters: 1) Project Area Context, 2)
Urban Archeology in Southeast Texas, 3) Archeological Assessment and Field
Investigation, and 4) Results and Recommendations.

I. PROJECT AREA CONTEXT

Physical Setting

The Project Area is located in Houston, Texas on USGS Houston Heights
Quadrangle on the southeast corner of Taft and Dallas in the neighborhood known as the
Fourth Ward. The entire Project Area is contained within the current school tract which
before demolition included the building, asphalt-paved parking lots, and grass-covered
areas.

General Historical Context (contribution by Rebecca Carroll)

Located west of downtown Houston, the Fourth Ward was established as one of
the original four wards by the City of Houston in 1840, only 4 years after the founding of
the city by Augustus C. and John K. Allen (Streetman 2008). The Fourth Ward became
known as Freedmenâs Town after it became the first black settlement in Houston
following the Civil War. Emancipated slaves began to buy land along the Buffalo Bayou
upon which to build their homes, which resulted in a thriving community by 1870
(Houston Public Library 2008). The original community stretched from Buffalo Bayou
south to Sutton Street, and west from around Milam Street to Taft Street.
th

The

th

community continued to grow, expanding in the late 19 and 20 century to eventually
encompass 80 blocks of residential area as thousands of freed slaves flooded into the city
after emancipation (Texas Historical Commission 2008). Freedmenâs Town consisted of
hundreds of houses, many of which were known as âshotgunâ homes, which may refer to
the saying that if you fire a shotgun through the front doorway of this long, narrow style
home, the bullet will exit directly through the back door. The term âshotgunâ may also
have been a misinterpretation of the word to-gun, used by Haitians, which means, "place
of assembly" (Santa Monica Conservancy 2008). The style is characterized by a single
story with a gabled roof. Mail-order plans and parts for shotgun homes were widely
available at the turn-of-the-century, making it a popular, low-cost structure to build in
both urban and suburban settings. This style of architecture was common along the Gulf

2

Coast in Louisiana and Texas, most often associated with African-American
neighborhoods, and was one of the most popular styles of home in the Southern United
States from the end of the Civil War to the 1920s, with its popularity decreasing due to
the affordability of the automobile and air conditioning. Freedmenâs Town also featured
larger houses such as T-shaped and L-shaped houses, many of which were owned by the
community leaders (Texas Historical Commission 2008).

The neighborhood also

contained several corner grocery stores and restaurants, as well as boarding houses and
apartment buildings (Wintz 2008).

The Old City/ Founderâs cemetery was within

Freedmenâs Town; however, not all of the communityâs dead were buried there. Rural
burial patterns were common because many could not afford burial plots or to transport
the body to a cemetery, therefore some of the deceased were buried by their family in the
back yard, as laws of the day did not restrict where a person could be buried (Hutchinson
2008).
Freedmenâs Town became the cityâs most prominent African-American
community.

This area was home to Houstonâs first African-American schools and

churches and was considered to be the economic and cultural center of Houstonâs
African-American population. The neighborhood was home to a number of churches,
such as Antioch Missionary Baptist, Good Hope Missionary Baptist, Shiloh Missionary
Baptist, St. James United Methodist and Bethel Baptist, which played an important role
in the community. Some of the leading members of the community included the Rev.
Jack Yates, his son Rutherford B. Yates, Alfred Smith, the Rev. Jeremiah Smith and the
Rev. Ned P. Pullam. The strong community identity was largely due to Freedmenâs
Town churches and schools, as well the areaâs library, businesses, hospital and
newspaper (Texas Historical Commission 2008).

By the early twentieth century

Freedmenâs Town housed prominent educational institutions, such as the Gregory School
(1870), which was a consolidation of the Freedmen's Bureau schools and was the first
public school for blacks in Houston (Streetman 2008). The area also supported the
majority of the black physicians and attorneys. In 1915 all but one of the black doctors
and dentists in Houston, as well as 75 percent of the black lawyers, had offices in the
Fourth Ward; in 1910 a group of black physicians established Houston's first black
hospital, Union Hospital, on Andrews Street near San Felipe. Development of the Fourth

3

Ward was capped by the construction of the Pilgrim Building, a four-story structure
located at Bagby Street and West Dallas Avenue that housed offices, clubrooms,
ballrooms and a rooftop roller rink (Wintz 2008); it was designed in 1926 by Alfred Finn
(Texas Historical Commission 2008 ). Until the mid-1920s the Fourth Ward was home
to the only black high school in Houston; established in 1893, the Colored High School,
was located at 303 West Dallas and was later renamed Booker T. Washington High
School (Wintz 2008).
Houstonâs expanding size in the 20th century as well as urban growth changed the
boundaries and character of Freedmenâs Town.

In the 1930s it was considered the

economic center for African-American Houstonians, with a large percentage of cityâs
black-owned businesses located within Freedmenâs Town.

However, from 1940 to

present, developments such as urban renewal projects and highway construction have had
an adverse effect on Freedmenâs Town. In the 1980s the only residential area left in the
Fourth Ward, along West Dallas (formerly San Felipe) and West Gray, had become the
poorest African-American community in the city of Houston with 50% of the 4,400
residents below the poverty line and only 5% of residents owning their own homes
(Wintz 2008). Due to an effort largely by the community residents, 40 blocks of the
original Freedmenâs Town was listed in 1985 on the National Register of Historic Places
(Houston Public Library 2008).
Gregory-Lincoln Education Center
Gregory-Lincoln Education Center (formerly the site of Abraham Lincoln Junior
and Senior High School) is a combined primary and secondary school and was built in
1966. The name is a tribute to Abraham Lincoln and Edgar M. Gregory, a colonel in the
Civil War who served with the 91st Regiment and the New York volunteers. After the
war, Gregory was appointed assistant commissioner of the Freedmanâs Bureau, which
managed relief work, education, labor contract supervision, and court protection in the
South after the war (HISD 2008).

II. URBAN ARCHEOLOGY IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS

Urban Site Formation in Houston, Texas
Excerpt from paper presented by Roger G. Moore at Texas Archeological Society
Meeting, 2000, Galveston

Extensive exposure to urban site formation and alteration processes have
suggested that a handful of dominant stratigraphic contexts can be defined which
combine to represent most of what you can expect to see when you get below the surface
in a central business district.

The following are the various types of stratigraphic

contexts:

Accretional contexts - artificial deposition of successive, often relatively thin fills
resulting in classic layer-cake stratifications of preserved, successive occupational
surfaces. This is very useful when punctuated by documented events such as fires or
demolitions that can be directly related to specific stratifications.

Sealed contexts - the occupational or primary depositional surfaces wholly or partly intact
and sealed by subsequent construction.

Truncated contexts - the occupational surface and often some of subsoil missing; this is
the most common archeological context to be encountered on urban investigations.

âBlown awayâ contexts â an absence of in situ deposits due to some combination of
truncation into sterile subsoil and homogenizing mixing of pre-existing deposits and
imported fills, both often containing artifacts.

These deposits are archeologically

important mostly in the ability to recognize such contexts and not expend unnecessary
time.

Non-archeological contexts - which are essentially âmade landsâ to a depth far exceeding
practical or justifiable archeological investigations such as artificially filled stream

5

channel deposits. May contain artifacts from elsewhere and archeologically important
mostly in the ability to recognize such contexts from both documentary and field data and
not waste further time on them.

Related Sites within the Fourth Ward
Two significant archeological investigations in the Fourth Ward have contributed
immensely the history of the community.
The latest and most pertinent archeological investigation encompasses the Project
Area discussed in this report. Between 2005 and 2006, Hicks & Company undertook an
extensive archeological research project in advance of construction of the HISDâs
Gregory-Lincoln Education Center.

It involved ten blocks (41HR1008-10017) and

focused on determining whether graves were present in the project area as well as
documenting historic archeological remains associated with a late nineteenth and early
twentieth century community, comprised primarily of African Americans and Italian
immigrants. Testing consisted of 55 trenches and 32 square meters of test units. Fifty
three features were documented, primarily early twentieth century African American
households. No graves were identified. Although all artifacts from the project were
saved and cataloged, due to the redundant nature of many of the artifacts, only
representative and diagnostic artifacts were curated (Feit and Jones 2007).
Another significant investigation in the Fourth Ward began in 1998 within Allen
Parkway Village (41HR886). The project involved an archeological survey, monitoring,
and cemetery removal of burials. There were buried cultural deposits such as former
drainages and cisterns and extensive remains of a late nineteenth-century cemetery.
More than 400 possible burial features were excavated and analyzed, resulting in
bioarchaeological identification of a predominantly African American population. The
cemetery investigation also included material culture analysis of burial containers,
hardware, and personal effects recovered in association with individual burial features
(Foster and Nance 2002).

III. ARCHEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND FIELD INVESTIGATION

Preliminary Assessment

Significant archeological remains which could potentially have occurred within
the Project Area fell into two broad classes: (1) prehistoric (i.e. Indian) archeological
deposits and features and, (2) historical-period archeological deposits and features
relating to the settlement and development of the City of Houston.
It is often the case that archeologically investigations within urbanized areas are
impeded by a mantle of overburden consisting of fill, demolition debris, and paving
surfaces, and the proposed New Exhibit Hall Building property is no exception to that
generalization. The current Project Area is entirely contained within the current school
tract which, before demolition, included the building, asphalt-paved parking lots, and
grass-covered areas.
Removal of urban structures and overburden necessitates the use of heavy
machinery in order to break up foundations, pavements and remove other deposits that
overlie the natural soil surface potentially containing intact archeological deposits and
features. This debris and overburden removal, in the case of construction monitoring, is
carried out by the construction contractor(s) with an archeological monitor(s) present to
recognize and record any archeological features or deposits exposed during these
excavations.
Demolition and construction excavations for utility lines, foundations, piers, and
other building elements may expose preserved archeological features. Archeological
features constitute constructions such as building foundations, wells, cisterns, privy
vaults and burials. Trash pits and other ânon-architecturalâ excavations into the subsoil
are also defined as archeological features. These features were excavated into this natural
soil surface which constituted the occupational grade at the time of initial settlement.
Downcutting to the undisturbed natural soil grade permits recognition of these
archeological features. For example, generally dark, organically-stained trash pit features
will contrast in both color and soil texture with the undisturbed natural soil into which

7

they were excavated. Brick or stone architectural features will, of course, be much less
subtle in appearance.

Field Investigation

Field methods used during monitoring followed the general procedures outlined in
the Technical Proposal presented with the Antiquities Permit Application.
The field investigations were conducted by MAC personnel under the supervision
of Principal Investigator David Driver, Ph.D., and Project Archeologist Kelly
Schexnayder. The fundamental exploratory goal of the monitoring program was to look
for exposed archeological features within the investigated portions of the GregoryLincoln project.
On March 12, 2008 the Project Archeologist met with Pyramid Constructors in
order to monitor certain construction excavations. The proportion of the structure
footprint subject to monitoring was determined to pertain to only those footings that go
below the select fill.

The select fill measured one meter on top of black clay which

extended another meter into Pleistocene clay. The majority of the footings ended in the
select fill and therefore did not require the monitoring of their removal (Figure 3). As a
result, only the excavation of three concrete footings was monitored, the deepest
measuring approximately three meters deep with a base measuring 1.5 meters wide
(Figure 2). The other two bales measured three to four meters deep, barely below the
select fill. All of the bales were located in the southwest area of the building footprint
(along Taft Street), each one approximately eight meters apart.

In addition, a storm

sewer was excavated in the southwest corner of the Project Area to 4.3 meters below
surface.

IV. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

No significant cultural materials or deposits were encountered during the course
of the construction monitoring. It is, therefore, recommended that construction of the
proposed Gregory-Lincoln Education Center be permitted to proceed with no further
cultural resource investigations. Although no cultural remains were encountered within
the Project Area, should any be encountered during construction, it is advised that
construction cease in the immediate area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission be contacted for further consultation.
