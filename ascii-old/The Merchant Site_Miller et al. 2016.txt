ABSTRACT

The Carlsbad Field Office contracted Versar, Inc. to conduct remedial archaeological data
recovery excavations at the Merchant site (LA 43414), a complex village settlement in
southeastern New Mexico. The Merchant site was excavated by the Lea County Archaeological
Society (LCAS) from 1959 to 1965, but the results of the excavations were never fully reported.
The site was fundamental to the definition of the Ochoa phase, but the nature of the phase had
remained poorly known since the excavations in the 1960s. The 2015 fieldwork included a
Transect Recording Unit survey, surface mapping and collections, remote sensing, hand and
mechanical excavations, and geomorphic studies. The entire site of LA 43414 was surveyed
and mapped, identifying several areas of prehistoric occupations including possible agricultural
fields. The primary focus of the fieldwork was the village area excavated by the LCAS and the
possible agricultural fields located 100 meters to the north.
The primary occupation of the Merchant site consists of a group of domestic rooms with stone
foundation walls, two deep pit structures, and extensive trash middens located on an elevated
escarpment overlooking the Mescalero Plain of southeastern New Mexico. The LCAS
excavations revealed intriguing details on architecture, ceramics, projectile points, and flaked
stone artifacts. The remedial excavations were able to clarify some of the architectural details,
as well as providing a review of the material culture using contemporary perspectives.
Excavations in two large and deep pit structures excavated by the LCAS in 1959 and 1960 were
able to clarify some details of the architecture and remodeling history of the structures, as well
as obtaining chronometric dates. The backdirt deposits in and around those structures, as well
as other refuse areas, contained thousands of animal bones, lithic flakes, and other items.
Volumetric analyses of the bone and artifact densities in midden areas and the backdirt spoil
piles found that the Merchant site ranks exceptionally high on the scale of occupational
intensity.
One of the potentially most significant findings was the discovery of possible agricultural
gridded fields to the north of the LCAS village. Geomorphological, archaeological, and
botanical studies were conducted in two possible agricultural features but the results are
equivocal. If future investigations confirm the presence of such features, they will represent the
easternmost expression of Southwestern intensive farming practices.
The most significant finding of the reinvestigation of the site is that it truly reflects a hybrid of
prehistoric Plains and Southwest architectural forms and technologies. The analysis of these
details provides new insights into the nature of Late Prehistoric Ochoa phase settlements in
southeastern New Mexico.

PREFACE

The year 1965 witnessed the publication of two very short but important papers in the first
volume of the journal Transactions of the Regional Archeological Symposium for Southeastern
New Mexico and Western Texas. This wholly avocational journal was produced by the supporters
of several archaeological societies that had banded together to publish the results of studies by
various members. This action had become necessary because the region represented by these
societies was not receiving adequate interest and support by the few professional archaeologists
located in far-off universities and museums. The publication of the journal and annual meetings
of the archaeological societies, known collectively as the Southwest Federation of Archaeological
Societies (SWFAS) or “The Federation,” have continued to the present day.
The first seminal paper mentioned earlier is by John Corley and is entitled “Proposed Eastern
Extension of the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon Culture.” In this paper, Corley outlines the first
synthesis of the archaeology of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent parts of Texas. He uses
culture traits to propose a set of phases modeled after the two archaeological sequences that
Donald Lehmer (1948) established for the greater El Paso region of southcentral New Mexico, far
western Texas, and the northern part of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Accordingly, Corley
named three phases—Querecho, Maljamar, and Ochoa—that roughly correlate with Lehmer’s
(1948) southern sequence of Mesilla, Doña Ana, El Paso and northern sequence of Capitan, Three
Rivers, San Andres. Like Lehmer, Corley suggests that all three phase sequences derived from an
earlier Archaic phase called the Hueco. Corley also suggested that his individual phases each
started 50 years later than the corresponding Lehmer phases. Although a few house structures
had been excavated by the various SWFAS societies, pottery assemblages provided the primary
criterion for assigning sites to phases within the Corley sequence.
It is important to note that Robert H. “Bus” Leslie published an updated version of the Eastern
Extension sequence in a 1979 paper entitled “The Eastern Jornada Mogollon, Extreme
Southeastern New Mexico (A Summary).” He proposed expanding Corley’s original sequence to
include a total of ten periods and phases: Paleoindian; Early and Middle Archaic; Hueco;
Querecho; Maljamar; Post-Maljamar/Pre-Ochoa; Ochoa; Post-Ochoa; Early Military, Early
Ranching, and Homesteaders; and a recent historic period concerning the development of the oil
and potash industries as well as more recent ranching and farming. The reason for the PostMaljamar/Pre-Ochoa “phase” or interval is because Leslie was not sure that the Ochoa developed
out of the Maljamar as previously thought. Instead, he thought that the peoples responsible for
the Ochoa phase may have entered the region following the Maljamar phase. Leslie also greatly
expanded the cultural attribute lists and discussion for each phase.
The primary site investigated by the Lea County Archaeological Society and the associated
Lovington Junior Archaeological Society was the Merchant site. The second seminal paper
mentioned earlier is entitled “The Merchant Site, L.C.A.S. E-4” by Bus Leslie. This paper briefly
describes the architectural and artifactual results of the excavations at this most important Ochoa
phase site. And it is this site, the subject of the current report by Myles Miller and his team,
which comes first to the minds of all archaeologists when contemplating the prehistory and
archaeology of the “Eastern Extension” of southeastern New Mexico.
The current volume by Miller and his team presents the results of a detailed study of the current
state of knowledge about the Merchant site. In putting together this information, Miller draws
heavily on an unpublished manuscript produced by Bus Leslie, now long deceased, and combines
with it a series of innovative field studies and laboratory analyses completed in 2015-2016. The
xxi

archaeological profession and other interested parties owe a great debt of gratitude to Miller, the
Carlsbad Field Office of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the Historic Preservation
Division of the State of New Mexico, the Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement Fund, and the
companies and corporations of the oil and gas industry, all of whom made this effort possible.

ROBERT H. “BUS” LESLIE
Bus Leslie set out to understand the prehistoric past of southeastern New Mexico, especially Lea
County. In the beginning it was casual, just a weekend or two each month to search the sand hills
for “Indian camps” without any previous experience or knowledge of who these people were or
where they had come from or when they were occupying the region. However, the “whys” began
to get the best of his curiosity, and he started to search for answers to what he was finding. It was
not easy as there were few resources available relating to the area. But there were numerous
publications about the Pueblo culture of northern New Mexico and he began to recognize the
pottery described in the professional journals that were appearing in his discoveries.
Fortunately, he had a friend, John Corley, who shared his enthusiasm for arrowhead hunting and
who had already accumulated a large collection from Central Texas and was very aware of some
of the regional variations as well as the basic dating of Paleoindian, Archaic, and arrow points.
Together they began to recognize the different types of sites within the territory they were
searching. They had encountered other amateur archaeologists and started asking if there would
be an interest in meeting on a regular basis to share information and learn more about their finds.
The response was overwhelming and they founded the Lea County Archaeological Society in
1957 and guided it through its early years, directing the excavations at Boot Hill and selecting E4, the Merchant Site, as the primary project for the Society.
Bus was indefatigable in his efforts to gain as much as possible from every trip and he continued
to compare, evaluate, study, correlate, and analyze the pottery that was being found, at the
Merchant as well as other sites that had been surveyed. In the process he determined that the
Ochoa pottery was an indented ware and that it was, to his understanding, made locally. The
results of his research were presented at the first Southwestern Federation of Archaeological
Societies meeting held in Hobbs in 1965. He went on to dedicate a better part of his life to
interpreting the archeology of southeastern New Mexico and would have been overjoyed to see
that his work was worthwhile and that the investigations continue as exemplified by this report.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The investigations at the Merchant site and the results reported herein are the product of a
cooperative and dedicated effort among many archaeologists from southern New Mexico. First
and foremost, the Carlsbad Field Office deserves credit for developing the project under the
Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement and their support and encouragement during the course
of the project. Martin Stein and Bruce Boeke deserve credit, and without their support it would
not have been possible to produce this report.
As always, I feel that the result of any excavation project is only as good as the quality of the
information recorded by the field crew. And, as always, Tim Graves deserves enormous credit
for the success of the remedial fieldwork at the Merchant site. Tim’s ability to deal with the
subtleties of architecture and stratigraphy and his mandate that excavations be accurately and
properly documented were the basis of the outstanding results seen throughout this report. Tim
also compiled the databases and data tabulations used throughout the report. Tim was assisted by
a field crew who performed an exemplary level of documentation on such a difficult and complex
site: Juan Arias, Jeremy Loven, Nate Montalvo, and Scott Cole. The photographic record of the
fieldwork was managed by Juan Arias who also assisted with the total station mapping of the site.
The document could not have been produced without the support and assistance of numerous
supervisory and support staff of Versar (formerly Versar-GMI). Duane Peter (Vice-President,
Cultural Resources Division) enthusiastically supported the project from the beginning.
Additional office and management support was provided by Peter Condon. Bridget McGregor
edited the 500+ pages of text. Lillian Ponce served as laboratory manager and did a fantastic job
of cataloging the tens of thousands of animal bones and other artifacts. Lillian also provided
much help and assistance in locating artifacts for study or documentation. Photographs of the
artifacts collected during the 2015 fieldwork were taken by Juan Arias and Nate Montalvo of the
El Paso office.
Feature planviews and profiles and site maps were produced by Amanda Maldonado. Amanda
also redrafted Robert Leslie’s drawings of rooms and pit structures for inclusion in Chapters Five
and Six. Mark Willis produced the contour and aerial imagery, and Katherine Jones produced the
GIS site maps and artifact density maps. All of the figures required several modifications and
corrections to meet my standards and to reflect the accompanying text discussions. Amanda,
Katherine, and Mark never grew impatient with my requests for changes, additions, and deletions.
I am grateful for their efforts and dedication to produce graphics of the highest quality and
accuracy.
One of the more difficult aspects of producing this report involved the archive of 50-year-old
photographic images. I thank Lillian Ponce for digitally scanning the collections of color slide
photographs and black-and-white contact sheets from Robert Leslie’s archive. Amanda
Maldonado spent numerous hours organizing and cleaning up the backgrounds of artifact
photographs so projectile points and other items could be presented in Chapter Twelve.
Several specialists contributed to the study of the natural setting and remote sensing studies.
Charles Frederick conducted the geomorphic investigations in the playa below the site and in the
suspected agricultural features. His contributions and insights are a critical component of the
discussions regarding those features. Mark Willis and Chet Walker conducted the remote sensing
studies, including aerial photography and photogrammetry and the ground penetrating radar
survey. Although contracted for a single field session, they returned to the site three times to
xxiii

obtain additional aerial images of the ongoing excavations. The imagery they collected proved to
be an essential component for several pursuits, including the attempts to locate the LCAS
domestic rooms and examine the possible agricultural terraces.
In a similar fashion, the specialists in the identification and analysis of subsistence remains and
geochemical sourcing deserve credit: Phil Dering, Susan Smith, Jeremy Loven, John Speth, and
Linda Scott Cummings. Jeremey and John analyzed several thousand animal bones and reviewed
the results in Chapter Eleven. Phil Dering and Susan Smith analyzed the flotation and pollen
samples recovered from pit structures, possible agricultural features, and other contexts. As
always, they were open to discussion and debate regarding the interpretation of the results, and
their counsel and insights are greatly appreciated. Linda Scott Cummings analyzed the starch and
phytolith residues on four tools from hearths and the suspected agricultural features. Steve
Shackley performed the X-ray fluorescence analysis of obsidian artifacts. For several years I
have enjoyed collaborating with Jeff Ferguson of MURR during efforts to classify and identify
production areas using NAA data on ceramics from the southern Southwest, including Ochoa
wares from the Merchant site. I also thank my colleague from east Texas, Tim Perttula, for his
help in trying to identify an unusual ceramic sherd recovered during our fieldwork.
Four scholars and enthusiasts of southeastern New Mexico prehistory deserve mention. I would
like to thank Jim Railey for his encouragement and support for our efforts at the Merchant site as
well as his willingness to share his information and insights on the prehistory of southeastern
New Mexico. Regge Wiseman offered comments and insights based on several decades of
experience with the prehistory of southern New Mexico. Calvin Smith, who was a member of the
Lea County Archaeological Society and as a young adolescent actually participated in Merchant
site excavations, offered important historical insights. Calvin also helped identify the individuals
in photographs. Chris Lintz provided a review and insights on the discussion of architecture in
Chapter Thirteen
John Speth was retained as a consultant on the project to assist with the analysis and
interpretation of the animal bone. John’s counsel and contribution extended far beyond the faunal
analysis. His interest, experience, and fondness for the archaeology of southeastern New Mexico
was apparent throughout the project, and he provided many insights on the material culture and
the broader implications of what we found during our fieldwork and study of Robert Leslie’s
notes and photographs. John was always willing to provide a comment or a source of information
for a question regarding the architecture and material culture, even when the question arrived via
a late night email. John also reviewed several draft chapters and provided insights and editorial
comments.
I appreciate the counsel, contributions, insights, and support of everyone who contributed to the
realization of this report.
Finally, Robert Leslie and the members of the Lea County Archaeological Society deserve
mention and commendation. Robert “Bus” Leslie, John Corley, John Runyan, Calvin Smith, and
several unnamed members of the society spent five years excavating the site during their
weekends and other free time. They did so while the site was being pillaged and looted and still
managed to document critical architectural and stratigraphic features and the material culture of
the site. In my opinion, their work was commensurate with much of the professional and
academic work conducted during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and without their dedicated and
remarkable efforts to document the archaeology of southeastern New Mexico, the Merchant site
would have been lost to looting. This report is dedicated to their memory and to their work.

Introduction to the Merchant Site and Background of Investigations

Chapter One
Introduction to the Merchant Site and
Background of Investigations
Myles R. Miller

The Merchant site is a fourteenth and early fifteenth century pueblo settlement located near
Grama Ridge, a prominent escarpment near the boundary where the basin-and-range region
merges with the southern Plains in the southeastern corner of New Mexico. The Merchant site is
representative of the Ochoa phase, a poorly understood time period of southeastern New Mexico
dating from around A.D. 1300/1350 to 1450. The Ochoa phase, and the El Paso and Late Glencoe
phases of the closely related Jornada Mogollon region to the west, are contemporaneous with the
Pueblo IV period of the greater Southwest, the Antelope Creek phase of the southern Plains, and
the Toyah phase of central Texas. As such, Merchant and other Ochoa phase settlements were
part of the widespread patterns of population aggregation, migrations, and diasporas and
accompanying developments in social and ritual organization that occurred throughout the
Southwest, northern Mexico, and southern Plains during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Despite often and undeservedly being relegated to a peripheral status, southeastern New Mexico
was an integral part of the broader Pueblo IV world. The prehistoric societies of southeastern
New Mexico did not exist in a social vacuum apart from the rest of the Southwest and southern
Plains. The presence of ceramics, obsidian, shell, and other materials from distant regions attests
to the fact that prehistoric groups in the region had far-flung economic and social relationships.
Southeastern New Mexico offers important insights into how the profound demographic and
settlement changes of the fifteenth century involved much larger scales than we have often taken
into account.
The investigations at the Merchant site add to a number of recent studies of village occupations in
southeastern New Mexico, including Boot Hill (Brown 2011), Laguna Plata (Condon et al. 2010),
Henderson pueblo (Rocek and Speth 1984; Speth 2004a), Bloom Mound (Kelley 1984; Speth
2008; Speth and Newlander 2012), Fox Place (Wiseman 2002), and Rocky Arroyo (Wiseman
1985). The Merchant site, along with Laguna Plata and Boot Hill, differed in one significant
aspect from the other excavations. Each of these sites was investigated by the Lea County
Archaeological Society between 1957 and 1971 (Corley and Leslie 1960; Lea County
Archaeological Society 1971; Leslie 1965a). The membership of the Lea County Archaeological
Society (LCAS) consisted of several energetic and dedicated amateur or avocational
archaeologists. Several of the members—Robert “Bus” Leslie, John Corley, John Runyan, and
Calvin Smith—produced the bulk of the archaeological knowledge and publications for
1

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

southeastern New Mexico prior to the 1980s. Unfortunately, other members of the society were
energetic and dedicated artifact collectors. Both the avocational and collector factions
participated in the early investigations of the Merchant, Laguna Plata, and Boot Hill sites, and it
appears that there was some form of détente between the two groups and certain parties were
allowed to dig in certain areas and retain the artifacts they recovered. Several passages in Robert
Leslie’s unpublished manuscript on the Merchant site also refer to “diggers” that apparently were
a third group of much more zealous and destructive looters that destroyed large parts of the
Merchant site at the same time that the LCAS was attempting to conduct some form of controlled
excavation. It is unknown if the more fervent looters were affiliated with the society, but it seems
unlikely because they often looted the site during times when the LCAS members were absent.
The LCAS investigations at the Merchant site took place between 1959 and 1965. Robert Leslie
published a brief paper on the site in the 1965 Transactions of the First Regional Archaeological
Symposium for Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas. Since the publication of Leslie’s
paper the Merchant site attained a somewhat mythical status in New Mexico archaeology. This
status was partially due to the fact that the LCAS excavations and Leslie’s 1965 publication gave
tantalizing details on rooms with formal stone foundation walls (or cimientos), two large and
deep pit structures that were called rooms or pithouses but had intriguing similarities to civicceremonial rooms of prehistoric and historic Southwestern cultures, thousands of projectile points
and formal tools, a new and indigenous ceramic ware called Ochoa Indented, and ceramics and
marine shell obtained from distant sources. The mythical status was also due to the fact that the
abovementioned details were known among the avocational and professional archaeological
communities of southeastern New Mexico, but aside from Leslie’s brief and basic overview, little
was truly known of the site beyond an amalgamation of hearsay and oral traditions.
John Speth mapped and tested the Merchant site in 1984, and the site was recorded and mapped
during surveys of several seismic lines during the 1990s. One such survey combined the LCAS
excavation area with several other sites and artifact scatters into a larger entity designated LA
43414. Two studies of specific aspects of the material culture from Merchant were completed
during the 2000s, including a study of chipped stone raw materials (Gregory 2006) and neutron
activation analysis (NAA) of a sample of Ochoa Indented ceramics (Alvarado 2008). Despite
these research and survey efforts, the fundamental nature of the site, its architecture, material
culture, and subsistence base remained for the most part unknown.
In order to remedy this situation, the Carlsbad Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management
developed a task order under the Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement that would dedicate
funding to the remedial mitigation and investigation of the Merchant site. As implied by the
phrase “remedial mitigation and investigation,” the project was primarily intended to remediate
the damage done by the looting of the site and attempt to clarify and stabilize the excavations
done by the LCAS between 1959 and 1965. A second component involves certain research
pursuits, including an analysis of the extensive collections of animal bone, chronometric dates,
and general reviews of the ceramic, groundstone, and chipped stone collections.

Regulatory and Contractual Background
Archaeological investigations at the Merchant site were initiated at the request of the Carlsbad
Field Office of the Bureau of Land Management under Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement
(PBPA) IDIQ contract No. L15PA00001, Task Order No. L15PB000031 “Remediation at the
Merchant Site, Lea County, New Mexico.” Versar, Inc. performed the work to assist in
compliance with Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as
amended through 1992) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s implementing
regulations as set forth under 36 CFR Part 800, and the goals set forth under the PBPA.

Chapter One
Introduction to the Merchant Site and Background of Investigations

A research design and work plan for remedial mitigation, documentation, and public outreach
was prepared by Versar in September of 2014 and was reviewed by the BLM Technical Proposal
Evaluation Committee. The research design was accepted in November and ARPA Permit 1038152-14-5 was received on November 14, 2014. Fieldwork began soon after and continued
through the winter and spring months of 2015.
The Merchant site is located in southern Lea County, New Mexico (Figure 1.1). Its location at
the margins—or what should more fittingly be considered the boundaries and frontiers—of
several prehistoric culture regions of the eastern and southeastern Southwest and the southern
Plains is the focal point of archaeological inquiry and the foundation of the research design for
the investigations.

Figure 1.1. General location of the Merchant site in southeastern New Mexico.

As noted above, the location of the 1959-1965 LCAS excavations was combined with two nearby
sites and several artifacts scatters to form a large composite site (Gregory 2001; Seymour 2001).
The original Laboratory of Anthropology site number of the LCAS village area—LA 43414—
was extended to the larger site. This has resulted in some confusion over whether the “Merchant
site” refers to the location of the LCAS excavations (the original LA 43414) or the large
composite site (the present manifestation of LA 43414). In the following report, the “Merchant
site” refers to the LCAS village area and any other location of LA 43414 that may have been
associated with the village area. LA 43414 is used to refer to the larger, composite site. As
presently defined, LA 43414 measures 938 m northwest/southeast by 461 m northeast/southwest
and has a GIS-defined site area of 238,600 square meters.

The Merchant site proper was excavated by Robert “Bus” Leslie and the LCAS. The descriptions
of features and strata, the artifact data, and the interpretations of the site would never have been
possible without Leslie’s dedication to documenting the site. His written and photographic
archives were carefully examined, and many important aspects of the features and artifact
assemblages are presented in this report. John Speth recalled several discussions with Bus Leslie
in the field, and his recollections of those conversations provided additional insights into the
nature of the LCAS excavations. The Merchant site can be considered the apex of Bus Leslie’s
legacy in southeastern New Mexico. For this reason, and for many more reasons, we have
posthumously included him as a co-author on the report.

The Merchant site is located at the edge of the southern Plains in west-central Lea County, New
Mexico. The region of southeastern New Mexico encompassing the site lies within the Pecos
Valley section of the Southern Great Plains physiographic sub-province (Gustavson et al.
1991:477). At a more localized scale of reference, the site and its environs are located on the
Mescalero Plain (Hogan 2006:2.3), a pediment surface that slopes from the base of the Mescalero
Ridge westward to the Pecos River Valley (Figure 2.1). The Mescalero Plain extends southward
from the Portales Valley to the New Mexico-Texas border. The only significant drainage of the
Mescalero Plain is Monument Draw in far southeast Lea County. Otherwise, 80 percent of the
Mescalero Plain is mantled by the Mescalero Dunes. Small ephemeral drainages and sinks,
ridges and swales, and rock outcrops provide most of the topographic relief (Reeves 1972).

Regional Geomorphology
Hall (2002) identifies the Mescalero Plain as an eolian sand sheet and adopts the term Mescalero
Sands to characterize the surficial geology of the region. The sand sheet is partially stabilized by
Shinnery oak that promotes the formation of parabolic coppice dunes where the sand is thick.
Surficial deposits on the Mescalero Plain also include eolian sands of Holocene to Pleistocene
age, isolated patches of recent alluvium, older Pleistocene alluvium, and red beds of the Triassic
Chinle and Permian Artesia Groups.
Hall (2002) developed a map of geoarchaeological units in southeastern New Mexico. He
identified five surficial mapping units (IA, IB, IIA, IIB, and III). The Merchant site is located
within Unit IIB and Unit III. Unit IIB surfaces are complexes of young and old deposits that are
predominantly older than the archaeological record. Hall states these deposits are mostly
colluvial and eolian in origin and include large areas of Pleistocene eolian sand deposits and
sediments with calcic paleosols. Archaeological sites of all ages occur within this mapping unit.
Most are surficial and are heavily bioturbated. Unit III includes deposits of Pleistocene age or
older. The escarpment edge location of the Merchant site village is on the surface of the Unit III
mapping unit. The northeastern parts of the site are within the IIB unit, although it is clear that
recent eolian deposition and mesquite parabolic dunes are present throughout this area.

Topography
The Merchant site lies in rolling dissected land about 2.1 km south-southwest of Grama Ridge
and about 2.7 km southwest of the San Simon Ranch headquarters (Figure 2.2). This region is
locally referred to as the San Simon Swale (Nicholson and Clebsch 1961:8; Figure 3), which is a
large, southeastern trending depression about 100 square miles in area that lies below and is
bordered by Grama Ridge. The San Simon Swale as well as the San Simon Sink, which is the
lowest part of the swale and lies within it, are both thought to be collapse features created by
dissolution of Permian-age soluble salt beds in the subsurface (cf. Ege 1984:4-5; Nicholson and
Clebsch 1961:45-46). The San Simon Sink lies about 7 km southeast of the site. Grama Ridge,
which borders the northeast side of the San Simon Swale, is a southwestward facing scarp that is

the western flank of an outlier of the Ogallala Formation and the Southern High Plains surface,
sometimes locally referred to as the Grama Ridge Area (Figure 2.3). Although this feature is
somewhat ill-defined on this map, a more recent geologic map of this area (New Mexico Bureau
of Mines and Mineral Resources (2003) provides a more distinct boundary for the Grama Ridge
Area, as an outcrop of the Ogallala Formation.
Some of the previously recorded information concerning the site (Leslie 1965a; see also the
updated site form in Schultheis and Baunstein 2009) mistakenly places the Merchant site on
Grama Ridge, but that scarp is clearly denoted on the local USGS topographic maps to the north
of the Merchant site. Although the west-facing ridge upon which the site is situated is similar in
some respect to Grama Ridge, the geologic contexts of the two ridges are completely different.
As noted previously, Grama Ridge is the southwestern edge of the Ogallala Formation and
borders an outlier of the Southern High Plains surface. The ridge upon which the Merchant site is
situated is underlain by a caliche, but it is much younger and thinner than the Caprock Caliche
which armors the Southern High Plains surface. Unfortunately, the association of the Merchant
site and Grama Ridge have become somewhat entrenched in the literature.
The escarpment upon which the village area of the Merchant site is located is a prominent feature
on the landscape (Figure 2.4), rising twenty to fifty feet above the San Simon swale and providing
a vantage point and view shed of several hundred square miles of the surrounding plains (Figure
2.5). The elevation of the site is 3,540 ft amsl at the southern end and 3,570 ft amsl at the
northern end. The elevation of the San Simon swale below the escarpment averages 3,510 ft
amsl. A shallow drainage crosses the site from the northwest through the east-central boundary.
The drainage is less than a meter or so wide at its origin but widens to nearly three meters in
width at the eastern site boundary. A small playa lakebed is present in the swale around 100 m to
the west of the escarpment and may have held water for brief periods after summer rains.

Environment
Climate
The present climate of the Chihuahuan desert of southern New Mexico is a semiarid mesothermal
regime characterized by hot daytime temperatures, relatively cooler nights, and low humidity.
Thirty years of data collected at the Eunice, New Mexico, weather station, the closest such station
to the Merchant site, reports an annual precipitation of 15.61 inches, with the majority of the
rainfall occurring between the months of May and October. A few miles further to the south, the
Jal station reports an annual rainfall of 14.61 inches.
Precipitation in the region comes from two major seasonal movements of air masses (Bomar
1983). Winter moisture is associated with the southerly deflection of polar Pacific air which
delivers a generally prolonged, low-intensity winter precipitation to the area. During the summer
months, beginning at the end of May and lasting through mid-October, convective cells are
formed by the intersection of moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico with local air masses
uplifted by intense surface heating (Tuan et al. 1973). The resulting summer precipitation is
localized and generally concentrated in short, high intensity thunderstorms in the mid-afternoon
and evening that often produce substantial runoff water in arroyo drainages and standing pools of
water in playa depressions. Over 50 percent of the total annual precipitation in southeastern New
Mexico occurs in a three-month period from July through September.

Mean monthly temperatures range from a low of 29º F in January to 67º F in July with high
temperature ranging from 57º F to 94º F for the same months. Summer temperatures often
exceed 100° F, and freezing temperatures may occur during the late winter months. Relative
humidity in the area is quite low, averaging from 10–14 percent during the winter and spring and
22–24 percent in the fall months (Ruffner and Blair 1987). The number of frost-free days in the
southern portion of Lea County range from 190 to 205 days per year. However, the agricultural
and biomass productivity of the regional environment is primarily tied to moisture availability
rather than growing season temperature (Ludwig 1986, 1987; Ludwig and Whitford 1981).
Soils
The Merchant site and the larger area subsumed within LA 43414 are located on the edge of an
escarpment ridge and extends across the sloping terrain to the east. A variety of soils and
surfaces are present across the area. Surfaces closest to the escarpment edge are dominated by a
thin veneer of a sandy loam with moderate to high densities of caliche nodules. These surfaces
are classified as a component of the Midessa Series soils and are specifically assigned to the
Midessa-Wink fine sandy loam (Turner et al. 1974:Sheet 140-141). The Midessa soils are
classified as a dark grayish-brown loam (Turner et al. 1974:27). The surfaces located east and
northeast of the escarpment edge are dominated by light brown sands with traces of caliche and
are classified as Wink fine sands (Turner et al. 1974:41-42). Mesquite coppice dunes with
heights reaching up to two meters are present in these areas, and interdunal areas have sheet sand
deposits or deflated areas. Caliche surfaces reaching several feet in thickness are exposed along
the edge of the escarpment edge and overlie a layer of dark reddish clay loam. These and other
soils exposed along the slopes of the escarpment on the lower slopes are assigned to the Pyote
Series (Turner et al. 1974:Sheet 140-141). The specific sediments around the Merchant site are
described as Pyote and Maljamar fine sands. The Pyote soils are light brown sands, and the
Maljamar sands are yellowish red sand to loamy sand (Turner et al. 1974:25, 33).
Vegetation
The modern vegetation of southeastern New Mexico is included within the Chihuahua Desert
Biotic province and the Desert Grassland ecotone. The Merchant site is situated within the PalinMesa Shrubland zone (Dick-Peddie 1991; Resource Geographic Information System, Earth Data
Analysis Center 1997). Vegetation within this zone (see Brown 2004; Dick-Peddie 1993b:106–
107, 116–120) consists of the signature grassland and shrub communities of creosotebush (Larrea
tridentata) and a variety of grasses including dropseed (Sporobolus sp.), Black and Side oats
grama grass (Bouteloua eriopoda and curtipendula), fluff grass (Erioneuron pulchellum), tobosa
(Hilaria mutica), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius), bushmuhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), and
Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides).
Common shrubs and trees include Shinnery oak (Quercus havardii), honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), whitethorn (Acacia constricta), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom snakeweed
(Gutierrezia sarothrae), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus
nauseosus) and tarbush (Flourensia cernua).
Several cactus species are common in the area, including prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.),
pencil cholla (Opuntia leptocaulis), yucca (Yucca spp.), horse crippler cactus (Homalocephala
texensis), and rainbow cactus (Echinocereus dasyacanthus). Forbs include burweed (Ambrosia
acanthicarpa), gourds (Cucurbita spp.), fleabane (Erigeron sp.), and red globemallow
(Sphaeralcea coccinia).
The flora obscures roughly 30 percent of the site during the winter months. During the spring,
the bloom of perennial plants can be quite dense and obscure more than 60 to 70 percent of site

12

Culture History

surfaces. Mesquite coppice dunes ranging in size from 20 cm to 2 meters are present across the
northern and northeastern parts of the site (Figure 2.6).
Several studies have provided evidence of substantial transitions in regional vegetation from
Pleistocene to historic times in the northern Chihuahuan Desert (Betancourt et al. 1990; Freeman
1972; Van Devender 1990). These studies have identified cyclical periods of increased or
diminished precipitation that resulted in the expansion of grassland or desert shrub communities.
This phenomenon has been demonstrated in historic times, as overgrazing and drought during the
latter part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries resulted in severe soil degradation and
radically altered vegetation patterns throughout much of southern New Mexico and west Texas,
the most visible change being the widespread expansion of mesquite shrub communities
(Buffington and Herbel 1965; Dick-Peddie 1975; Gardner 1951; York and Dick-Peddie 1969).

Figure 2.6. Mesquite coppice dune terrain present across the northern and northeastern parts of LA 43414.

Fauna
A variety of fauna are present in the northern Chihuahuan Desert and southern Plains, many of
which were hunted and trapped by the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. A list of common
fauna in the region is provided in Brown (2004). Mammals found in the area during the past and
present times are associated with the Desert Grassland and Chihuahuan Desert Scrub. These
include the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), bison (Bison
bison), desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus),
spotted ground squirrel (Spermophilus spilosoma), woodrat (Neotoma spp.), coyote (Canis
latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus), and a variety of rodents. Bison are now extinct in the region
unless re-introduced by modern ranchers.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Various birds such as the scaled quail (Callipepla squamata), mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), raven
(Corvus sp.), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), and hawks are common in the region. The
western rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum), bullsnake (Pituophis
melanoleucus), western box turtle (Terrapene ornata), Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), and
various lizards are among the reptiles and amphibians present. Three native unionid bivalves
(mussels) were once native to the lower Pecos River of southeastern New Mexico, but only the
Texas hornshell (Popenaias popeii) is still extant in the area, occurring as far north as Chaves
County (Howells 2003:62; Lang 1996).
Stone Resources
The Ogallala and Chinle Formations provide accessible sources of sandstone, chert, and quartzite
for tool production. The exposures of Upper Chinle sandstone along the base of the escarpment
provided a readily accessible source of material for groundstone tools. The Mescalero caliche
formation provided a source of material for cookstones, the foundation walls of houses, and
perhaps was used as source of temper for the production of Ochoa wares. The caliche and
Ogallala formations underlying the site contain chert and quartzite gravels that were used for
flaked stone tools and hammerstones. Additional sources of raw materials for ground and flaked
stone tools are reviewed by Gregory (2006) and Vierra et al. (2013).

Geomorphological Context of the Merchant Site
At a local scale, the Merchant site is situated on an elevated piece of land, locally referred to as
the mesa, that is tilted gently to the southeast and that is bordered on the west by an abrupt
southwestward to westward facing scarp (Figure 2.7). This scarp is the eastern edge of a roughly
elliptical basin, the center of which lies about 0.5 mile (0.8 km) southwest of the core of
Merchant site and lies about 90 feet (27 m) below the highest part of the basin rim. This basin is
oriented south-southeast and is drained by two ephemeral streams, one that exits the basin almost
due south and that drains the east side of basin, and a second that flows out of the basin on its
southwest side. These two streams flow around either side of a broad hill (about 0.6 miles [1 km]
at its widest extent) that forms the southern side of the basin and then join on its south side, about
1.5 miles (2.5 km) south-southwest of the core of the Merchant site. This stream then ends in a
broad fan on the floor of San Simon Swale about 0.7 miles (1 km) south of their confluence. The
floor of the basin lies about 3,480 ft amsl and is an alluvial flat that has been referred to as a dry
lake bed or playa (LCAS article), but there is no evidence observable in the field of this feature
having ponded water for any significant time. Aerial images of the basin floor exhibit an area of
low albedo that is formed by more dense vegetation on the basin floor which today forms the
drainage divide between the two ephemeral streams that drain the basin. Between the mesa edge
and the basin floor is a dissected slope or beveled base, which consists of a thin mantle of
colluvium resting upon highly erodible Permian-Triassic red beds which have been dissected by
numerous small channels and gullies. The abrupt edge, flat floor, and general shape of this basin
suggest it may be a solution collapse feature that has been subsequently altered by erosion.

The mesa on the east side of the basin, upon which the site is situated, ranges from about 3,570 ft
amsl at the north end of the site to about 3,540 ft amsl at the south end of the site. The surface of
the mesa is a gently concave or water-gathering slope than drains to the southeast. The scarp that
forms the western edge of the mesa ranges from a short (<2 m) vertical cliff to a steep rounded
shoulder slope. Bedrock (caliche) dominates the ground surface right at the edge, and a short
distance to the east this surface becomes mantled with a thin veneer of eolian sand. This drape of
windblown sand generally thickens across the mesa and appears to be notably thicker east of the
drainage that occupies the center of the water gathering slope. The thickest part of the eolian
veneer is formed by mesquite coppice dunes which are taller and more coalesced on the east side
of the mesa.
Geology
The geology of this region has only been mapped at a broad level (1:500,000 scale) by the New
Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources (2003), and the entire site is identified as eolian
and piedmont deposits (Qep) that range in age from Holocene to middle Pleistocene. About 2 km
to the north of the site lies an outcrop of the Ogallala Formation, the southwestern edge of which
is defined by Grama Ridge, and this surface includes a wide range of cover sediments and calcic
15

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

soils present on the High Plains (e.g. Map Unit Qoa of New Mexico Bureau of Mines and
Mineral Resources (2003)). Reconnaissance of the site identified four geologic deposits present
(from oldest to youngest): 1) Permian/Triassic sandstone and shale, 2) Tertiary/Quaternary
Caliche conglomerate within which a petrocalcic horizon had formed, 3) Late Pleistocene and
Holocene alluvium and colluvium, and 4) Holocene eolian sand.
Permian/Triassic Sandstone and Shale: Although not specifically mapped in this region by the
New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, the bedrock exposed at the site and in this
general region are most likely members of the Triassic age Upper Chinle Group which includes
the Garita Creek, Trujillo, Bull Canyon and Redonda Formations which compose most of the
larger exposures of Permian/Triassic rocks in this region (New Mexico Bureau of Mines and
Mineral Resources 2003). Nicholson and Clebsch (1961:33-34) describe the geology of this
region in some detail, and they refer to these deposits as Permian or Triassic Redbeds,
undifferentiated.
These deposits are nicely exposed on the basin slope immediately west of the mesa, and three
units are present: 1) a light gray to light greenish gray sandstone, 2) pale green muds, and 3)
dusky red muds. The pale green muds are separated from the dusky red muds by a ledge forming
bed of sandstone and siltstone that dips gently to the southeast, and that is underlain by the dusky
red muds.
Caliche: The top of the mesa is underlain and armored by a calcium carbonate cemented
conglomerate that is composed primarily of rounded to subrounded clasts of reworked caliche as
well as a few siliceous clasts. The general appearance and composition of this deposit suggests it
was derived from erosion of the Ogallala Formation caprock caliche. A petrocalcic horizon has
formed within this deposit, and the top of this unit comprises a very undulate laminar calcic
horizon, which grades downward to a carbonate cemented conglomerate (a Stage IV Calcic
Horizon). The character of this deposit is shown in Figure 2.8.
This deposit is locally referred to as the Mescalero Caliche (Bachman 1984; Kennedy 1997), and
its stratigraphic position on a surface below the outcrop of the Ogallala Formation suggests that it
is a remnant of the Gatuña Formation, which is the name given to terrestrial deposits that began to
fill the Pecos River valley after it had been formed by erosion (Hawley 1993; Powers and Holt
1993). The deposits within which the petrocalcic horizon has formed on the site are not typical of
the Gatuña Formation but are consistent with this origin. The Mescalero paleosol, as described
by Hall and Goble (2006), appears to have formed between approximately 620,000 and 90,000
years B.P. based on the presence of the Lava Creek B tephra within the Gatuña Formation and the
oldest OSL age obtained by Hall and Goble (2006) for the eolian sediments covering the paleosol.
The Mescalero Caliche or paleosol observed at the Merchant Site and described regionally by
Kennedy (1997) is a considerably more advanced calcic horizon (typically a Stage IV to VI calcic
horizon) than that described as the Mescalero paleosol by Hall and Goble (2006:300-302), which
they describe as a Stage II to III. A loose cover of caliche gravel and cobbles rests on top of
laminar cap of the Mescalero Caliche across the mesa at the site.
Quaternary Alluvium and Colluvium: The slope that separates the mesa from the basin is
traversed by a network of drainage channels that converge as the gradient of the slope declines
toward the basin floor. The steeper slopes between these channels is mantled with a thin (<0.5 m)
veneer of colluvium. As the slope gradient declines to the west, isolated patches of alluvial
sediment start to appear and gradually become more frequent toward the basin floor, where the
fragments coalesce to eventually dominate the basin. The alluvial deposits share the dusky red
color of the Permian/Triassic sandstone and shale but contain coarse fragments mostly derived
from the caliche as well as the more resistant sandstone.

Eolian Sand: The top of the mesa is draped by a veneer of eolian sediment which appears to
consist of two deposits previously described by Hall and Goble (2006): the Upper Eolian Sand
and the modern eolian sand within which the coppice dunes have formed and that hereafter will
be referred to as the Recent Eolian Sand. The eolian cover sands are absent at the western edge
of the mesa and begin to mantle the caliche first as a thin sand sheet, gradually turning to a field
of mesquite coppice dunes, the size of which (both height and width) gradually increase across
the mesa to the east and north.
The Upper Eolian Sand
Hall and Goble (2006, 2011) report the Upper Eolian Sand is the main component of the
Mescalero Sands and ranges up to 4 to 5 meters thick. This sand was deposited between
approximately 5,000 and 9,000 years B.P. as determined by single aliquot optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) dating.
The Upper Eolian Sand is present across the mesa, but in most locations it was noted to be less
than 25 cm thick and rests directly upon the Mescalero Caliche. In such exposures, a welldeveloped A horizon (presumably the Loco Hills Paleosol) has formed through the deposit, and
this unit is a brown (7.5YR 3/3) fine sand to loamy fine sand with between 0.6 and 1.4 percent
organic matter and between 0.6 and 1.1 percent calcium carbonate.
The thickest exposure of this deposit was uncovered in an off-site control exposure immediately
north of the site but south of the pipeline that borders the site to the north. This exposure was
excavated into the side of a coppice dune and exposed 55 cm of the Upper Eolian Sand. Here the
Loco Hills Paleosol consisted of a 34 cm thick very faintly melanized brown (7.5YR 5/4) Ab
horizon, that in turn rested upon a light brown (7.5YR 6/4) AC horizon.
Recent Eolian Sand (post-Upper Eolian Sand)
The younger of the two eolian deposits at the Merchant site has not been named by Hall (2002)
and Hall and Goble (2006, 2011) but it comprises the sand associated with the coppice dunes that
are a ubiquitous component of the modern landscape. The age of this deposit is assumed by Hall
and Goble (2006) to be Historic, but only one single aliquot OSL date has been obtained from this
deposit by Hall and Goble (2011; from the “post-Upper Eolian Sand”) and the cited age of
620±40 years (UNL-2623) was determined using a minimum age model that excluded older
aliquots from the age calculation. The same sample yielded an age of 1430±130 years B.P. when
all of the aliquots were included. If the coppice dunes are as young as Hall and Goble (2006)
advocate (presumably <150 years), then the age obtained for this sample is too old, most likely
due to post-depositional bioturbation mixing of the Recent Eolian Sand with the underlying
Upper Eolian Sand. Single aliquot OSL dates on mixed grain age samples are known to yield
unreliable ages (cf. Bateman et al. 2007a, 2007b). To avoid such problems in settings where
post-depositional pedoturbation has occurred, only single grain OSL dating will yield reliable
ages.
At the Merchant Site, the Recent Eolian Sand is thickest (approaching a meter) where found in
association with mesquite coppice dunes, but most of the coppice dunes are less than 50 cm tall.
Between the coppice dunes, the Recent Eolian Sand is present everywhere across the mesa as a
thin (2–10 cm) sand sheet deposit. This deposit is a brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sand, with between
0.5 percent and 1 percent calcium carbonate and organic matter content ranging from values
similar to that obtained from the Loco Hills Paleosol beneath it (around 1 percent; but lacking any
evidence of melanization) to about half that amount (about 0.5 percent at its lowest). The greatest
organic matter content value obtained in the lab work came from the top 5 cm of a coppice dune
which had >1.2 percent, despite no visible darkening of the deposit nor obvious macro-organic
remains.

Prehistory and Early History of Southeastern New Mexico
A brief overview of the prehistory and early history of southeastern New Mexico is provided
here. Several recent overviews have been produced that offer more detailed discussions of the
prehistoric and historic cultural sequences. The two most notable sources are the Regional
Research Design (Hogan 2006) and a recent overview that incorporates analyses of radiocarbon
dates and site locational information (Railey 2015). Another relevant source is Miller and
Kenmotsu (2004) who review cultural developments in the neighboring Jornada and Trans-Pecos
regions, most of which are related to those in southeastern New Mexico. Table 2.1 lists the
primary cultural periods of interest in the following discussion.
Paleoindian Period
Although new discoveries and ensuing debates over the earliest presence of humans in North
America have been a common feature of archaeological and popular reports of the past two
decades, the earliest firmly-documented occurrence of human groups in southeastern New
Mexico dates to the Paleoindian tradition.
The Paleoindian period is divided into three subperiods reflecting changing environmental
conditions, hunting practices, and associated technologies and projectile point forms: Clovis
(11,500–10,800 B.C.), Folsom (10,800–9800 B.C.), and Late Paleoindian (9800–7000 B.C.).
Hunting practices focused on large game such as mammoth, mastodon, and bison, but plant
collecting also played a role in Paleoindian subsistence. Large, well-made lanceolate spear points
were the signature diagnostic items of the period. Formal bifacial tools and retouched end
scrapers reflect a mobile hunting tradition.

Archaic Period
The advent of the Archaic period took place as the Pleistocene epoch changed to the warmer and
drier climate of the Holocene around 7,000 B.C. Prehistoric groups inhabiting southeastern New
Mexico had to adapt to the changing environment, including different game sources and
distributions of plant foods and water. New technologies appeared such as plant baking pits,
grinding tools, and a variety of tool forms. The long Archaic interval is conventionally
subdivided into three subperiods: Early (7000–3200 B.C.), Middle (3200–1800 B.C.), and Late
(1800 B.C.–A.D. 200/500). The dating of these subperiods varies among publications both
within southeastern New Mexico and from surrounding regions but generally follows the outline
listed above.
The Early Archaic period is one of the most poorly-known periods across all of southern New
Mexico and western Texas (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Railey 2015). The archaeological period
19

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

is contemporaneous with the paleoenvironmental Altithermal period, an extremely warm and dry
period of the Holocene. As water sources dried up or became increasingly restricted and
unreliable, prehistoric groups abandoned much of the Chihuahua Desert lowlands. A few sites of
this period are known from the diagnostic stemmed projectile points such as Jay and Bajada, but
the numbers of recorded Early Archaic sites in southeastern New Mexico, as well as adjacent
areas of west Texas and northern Chihuahua, are fewer than the preceding Paleoindian period.
The first half of the Middle Archaic period appears similar to the Early Archaic, characterized by
warm and dry environmental conditions of the Altithermal and low population densities. During
the latter half, between 2500 and 2200 B.C., the first constellation of traits marking a consistently
identifiable Archaic settlement adaption and technological tradition appears in southern New
Mexico and western Texas. Notably, this interval coincides with the beginning of the Late
Holocene wet period. Village settlements, contracting stem dart points, agave baking pits, and
large communal plant baking pits appear at this time. There is new evidence for the appearance
of maize to the west in the Jornada region, although no evidence of Middle Archaic horticulture
has yet been found in southeastern New Mexico. The first well-dated rock art also occurs during
this interval (Loendorf et al. 2016). As noted by Miller (2016), the first widespread evidence of
placemaking on the landscape and communal gatherings occurs during the latter half of the
Middle Archaic, and it is during this period that several trends in social organization, landscape
use, and technology are established that persist throughout the next 4,000 years of the Archaic
and Formative/Ceramic periods.
The Late Archaic begins at circa 1800 B.C. and is marked by widespread changes in land use,
settlement intensity, and a diversity of technological adaptations. A widely noted aspect of Late
Archaic tool technology is the diversification of projectile point types, although most points have
hafted forms with side or corner notching and convex or flat bases. Maize agriculture is known
from the Sacramento/Sierra Blanca/Capitan highlands to the north and the Jornada region to the
west, but no clear evidence of Late Archaic agriculture has been found in southeastern New
Mexico. The presence of house structures, storage facilities, and dense refuse areas suggests that
an increase in the duration of settlements took place, along with a corresponding reduction in
mobility. The increasing numbers of radiocarbon dates and radiocarbon-dated contexts reflect
both a population increase and a more widespread use of environments during the period (Railey
2015). It is likely the social and technological developments of the preceding Middle Archaic
period continued to evolve, as well as expanding into a greater variety of environmental niches.
Formative-Ceramic Period
Conventionally, the end of the Archaic in the Southwest is demarcated by the appearance of
ceramic containers and the bow and arrow, and on these criteria the Jornada Archaic comes to a
close sometime between 1700 and 1500 cal. B.P. (A.D. 300 and 500).
A somewhat bewildering assortment of phase sequences has been proposed for the Formative
period across southern New Mexico (see Miller 2005 and Railey 2015). For convenience, we
follow Railey (2015) and review developments in southeastern New Mexico under two temporal
segments: Early Formative (A.D. 500 – 1150) and Late Formative (A.D. 1150 – 1450).
The Early Formative period is marked by the appearance of new technologies such as ceramics
and the bow and arrow that also denote significant changes in adaptation and lifeways. The first
undecorated brownwares appear at around A.D. 500. The appearance of the bow and arrow is
marked by the smaller size of projectile points such as Bonham, Scallorn, and Livermore types.
Despite the occurrence of ceramics, settlement mobility remained relatively high and settlements
were of short duration. The most common architectural forms were small brush huts and small,
shallow pit structures. In contrast to areas to the north and west, there is little evidence of
agriculture in the lowlands of southeastern New Mexico. A pronounced increase in radiocarbon
20

Chapter Two
Environment, Geomorphology, and
Culture History

dates and dated contexts occurs at around A.D. 600 (Railey 2015; Railey et al. 2009, 2011), a
similar pattern observed across the southern and northern Southwest and termed the “Neolithic
Demographic Transition” (Kohler and Reese 2014; Kohler et al. 2008). However, based on the
paucity of agricultural settlements it is likely that southeastern New Mexico was peripheral to—
but not unaffected by—such demographic and subsistence changes, and that whatever form the
NDT manifested in the region, it occurred later in time during the Late Formative.
It was during the Late Formative that the most pronounced and archaeologically visible
settlement, subsistence, and social developments took place. A variety of decorated ceramic
wares are present at sites of this period, including types manufactured in adjacent regions such as
Chupadero Black-on-white, Three-Rivers Red-on-terracotta, Lincoln Black-on-red, El Paso
Polychrome, Ramos Polychrome, and Rio Grande Glazewares, as well as new and distinctive
locally produced types like Ochoa Indented Corrugated.
By the fourteenth century, numerous large, permanent villages had been established. Settlement
types include pueblos and pithouse villages, and examples of civic-ceremonial architecture (also
called kivas or communal rooms) have been recorded at several such villages, including the deep
kiva room with a horned serpent painted on the plastered walls at the Fox Place site near Roswell
(Wiseman 2002). However, despite the presence of permanent village settlements, the number of
radiocarbon dates declines during this period, though this pattern may not apply to the Mescalero
Plain and the Roswell Oasis. Late Formative subsistence practices continue to be debated.
Whether maize-based farming contributed a substantial part of the prehistoric diet remains
uncertain, especially in light of evidence for increased big game hunting during this time.
One of the hallmarks of the Late Formative was that the Southwestern world was one of
movement: movement of people, food, trade goods, socially valued items, and ideas. The
prehistoric societies of southeastern New Mexico, once somewhat peripheral to such things, were
now an active participant and likely an active protagonist in such movements of goods and
people.
The Ochoa Phase of A.D. 1300-1450: Amidst several phases characterized for the Late Formative
period in southeastern New Mexico and adjoining areas, the Ochoa phase is of primary interest
for the present study. While the Ochoa phase is part of the local tradition of southeast New
Mexico, it is important to place the phase and the settlements of this period within a broader
geographic context. The Ochoa phase, and the El Paso and Late Glencoe phases of the Jornada
Mogollon region to the west, are contemporaneous with the Pueblo IV period of the greater
Southwest, the Antelope Creek phase of the southern Plains, and the Toyah phase of central
Texas. Ochoa phase settlements were part of the widespread patterns of population aggregation,
migrations and diasporas, and the accompanying developments in social and ritual organization
that occurred throughout the Southwest, northern Mexico, and southern Plains during the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Settlements of the Ochoa phase are located 150 km from the
Jornada El Paso phase pueblos of the Roswell Oasis and 200 km from those of the southern
Sacramento Mountains, yet constitute a unique geographic and temporal entity.
The Ochoa phase was primarily defined on the results of the LCAS excavations at the Merchant
site. Leslie (n.d.) describes additional Ochoa phase sites in the region, and Collin’s 1968
unpublished thesis provides additional details on the Salt Cedar site in nearby Andrews County,
Texas. However, these studies were conducted more than 50 years ago. Based on the
fragmentary information, Ochoa phase settlements generally have been interpreted as short-term
occupations by mobile populations with limited emphasis on agriculture and hunting, similar to
the patterns observed for several preceding millennia. Given that the geographic definition of the
Ochoa phase was in the center of all the economic and social interaction occurring across the
southern Plains and Southwest during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, this led to certain
21

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

questions of whether Ochoa phase sites truly were some form of fossilized, isolated huntergatherer society. The investigations of the Merchant site were intended to address these and other
issues.
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period begins with the widespread abandonment of village settlements,
and indeed most settlements, across southeastern New Mexico and the southern Plains around
A.D. 1450. The decline in the numbers of radiocarbon-dated contexts and numbers of sites
identified through survey (Railey 2015) are not restricted to southeastern New Mexico but reflect
a much broader geographic phenomenon across the southern Southwest and northern Chihuahua
(Miller 2001).
Sites of this period are difficult to identify because of the lack of diagnostic ceramics, tool forms,
architectural forms, and even settlements. Regional ceramic production ceases, and it also
appears that exchange of ceramics from settlements in northern New Mexico also ends. Rock
rings marking the locations of structures (wikiups, tipis) have been assigned to this period, but
they often lack secure associations with dates and diagnostic artifacts and cannot be conclusively
identified as dating to the Protohistoric interval. In fact, the numbers of sites and instances of
material culture are exceptionally rare, and this paucity of archaeological evidence is reflected in
the radiocarbon record that shows a dramatic decline in dates after A.D. 1450. In the plains to the
east, village groups may have shifted to a more nomadic adaptation based on bison hunting.
However, the abandonment of the Permian basin and other regions to the west does not appear to
reflect such a shift and instead seems to have been a regional depopulation and perhaps a
migration. It is unknown whether the inhabitants migrated to the plains, to the clusters of huge
Pueblo V period pueblo settlements in the northern Rio Grande region, to the mountains of
northern Chihuahua, or perhaps all three regions.
Early Historic Period
The Early Historic period, also known as the Spanish Colonial period, is marked by the entry of
Spanish explorers, colonists, and priests into northern Mexico and the American Southwest.
Early expeditions included Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (1528–1536), Francisco Vásquez de
Coronado (1540–1542), Chamuscado and Rodriguez (1580–1581), Antonio de Espejo (1582–
1583), and Gaspar Castaño de Sosa ( 1590) (Hammond and Rey 1966). The early entradas
documented native nomadic groups subsisting on cacti and bison. Colonization began in 1598
with the expedition of Juan de Oñate and the establishment of the first mission settlement in what
is now Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. The Salinas missions were established in the early 1600s, and
the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 led to the establishment of mission settlements in the Rio Grande
Valley south of El Paso. Throughout this period, the relations between the Spanish and pueblo
inhabitants fluctuated from mutual interaction to outright hostility. The situation was exacerbated
by the arrival of Apaches and other Athabaskan groups.

The Merchant site has been the subject of avocational and professional archaeological interest
since the late 1950s. Unfortunately, it was also of interest to looters and arrowhead collectors and
suffered considerable damage from uncontrolled excavations beginning with its discovery in the
late 1950s and through the ensuing two or three decades. The following chapter reviews the
history of investigations.
The “history of investigations” sections of many reports and for many sites are often somewhat
inconsequential to the design of research in contemporary times. In some cases they are simply
presented as a footnote of historical interest, for example, certain cases where a prominent
archaeologist may have worked on a site at one time or another. In the case of the Merchant site,
however, the 57 years of previous excavations, surveys, research studies, and looting are critical
to understanding the nature of the site, the present condition and data potential of its features and
deposits, and for the design of remedial fieldwork and future research. The long and varied
history of investigations is reviewed in the first section of the following chapter, along with a
review of Robert Leslie’s legacy at the Merchant site. The scope of work and research design for
the remedial mitigation work and research program are presented in the second section of the
chapter, along with reference to the list of tasks required by the Carlsbad Field Office as part of
Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement contract for investigations at the site.

Previous Investigations
The Merchant site is known by several temporary and provisional site numbers assigned by
Federal and State agencies, archaeological surveyors, and avocational archaeologists. In a
general approximation of the historic sequence, the numbers include Lea County Archaeological
Society (LCAS) Site E-4, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Site AR-30-6-31, and Laboratory
of Anthropology Site number LA 43414. Temporary numbers assigned during various survey
projects include PAC/Le-042, LCAS E-22, and LMAS 636-423. The original LCAS Merchant
site and two nearby sites, LA 43416 and LA 65936, were incorporated into a larger aggregate site
in 2001. The variety of temporary and permanent identification numbers is a testament to the fact
that the site has been excavated, surveyed, tested, and recorded numerous times.

23

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

1959-1965: Robert “Bus” Leslie and the Lea County Archaeological Society
Robert “Bus” Leslie1, an enthusiastic and dedicated avocational, first visited the Merchant site in
1959. He was guided to the site by two members of the newly formed Lea County
Archaeological Society who, along with other local amateurs and artifact collectors, had been
digging and screening midden mounds that had gained a reputation for having exceptionally rich
artifact deposits. Upon viewing the destruction and disorder caused by uncontrolled looting,
Leslie attempted to impose some degree of organization and archaeological structure at the site,
organizing numerous weekend excursions to excavate several of the more prominent and
significant features. At first he visited the site with his children, excavating Rooms 3 and 4 and
exploring various locations. Beginning in 1960 or 1961, a rather consistent group of LCAS
members and Lovington Junior Archaeological Society members numbering from six to twenty
would work at the site (Figure 3.1). Excavations continued through 1965, at which point it was
felt that a majority of the major features had been excavated and most of the midden deposits and
other contexts had been looted. Several of the early luminaries of southeastern New Mexico
archaeology, including John Corley, John Runyon, and Calvin Smith, participated in the
excavations (Figure 3.2).
Leslie and the LCAS did a commendable job of controlled excavations in units and levels,
describing stratigraphy and architectural features, and collecting and proveniencing artifact
assemblages. The efforts are even more admirable in light of the fact that features and deposits
across the site were being actively looted between and even during the LCAS excavations.
Leslie, in his unpublished manuscript and via the photographic record of his visits to the site,
documents the struggle to maintain consistent excavations against a constant onslaught of looting
and artifact mining.
Leslie first brought attention of the Merchant site to a broader audience by summarizing the
discoveries in a 1965 paper published in the Transactions of the First Regional Archaeological
Symposium for Southeastern New Mexico and Western Texas sponsored by the Southwest
Federation of Archaeological Societies (SWFAS) founded in the fall of 1964 by Corley, Leslie,
and Smith. The report included a site map (Figure 3.3) and plan maps of the two surface rooms
and deep pit structures, as well as photographs and descriptions of projectile points and ceramics.
Seven surface rooms with stone foundation walls were excavated, and several more rooms were
probed or described. Thousands of artifacts, including over 1,500 projectile points, were
mentioned in the brief site report.
For the next 50 years, the SWFAS article served as the primary source of information on the
Merchant site. A comprehensive report of the LCAS excavations was written by Bus Leslie but
never published (Leslie n.d.). Leslie gave a copy of the report to John Speth in 1984. Dr. Speth
gave Versar, Inc. a copy of the manuscript and the collection of Leslie’s slides and photographs
of the LCAS work in southeastern New Mexico. The unpublished manuscript has been typeset
and formatted and is included as Appendix A in this report. The manuscript includes an updated
site map (Figure 3.4) that differs in several ways from the map in the 1965 article, incorporating
new insights from his continued visits to the site and reconsideration of certain aspects of the
LCAS excavations. For 50 years, the fragmentary and tantalizing information in the 1965 report
has been part of the legend and lore of southeastern New Mexico prehistory.

History of Investigations, Research Design, and Field Methods

The Merchant site manuscript provided additional details on the 21 surface rooms, two pit
structures, refuse areas, bedrock mortar clusters, and other details of the site. The manuscript also
included discussion and images of artifacts that have proven invaluable since all the collections
were lost after Leslie’s death. His collection of slides and black-and-white contact sheets were an
invaluable contribution to the study of the architectural and stratigraphic details of the site as well
as the history of the LCAS fieldwork.
Several of Leslie’s photographs are labeled as having been taken in 1976 and 1984, showing that
he continued to visit the site for 20 years or more after the completion of the excavations in 1965.
It is also likely that looters and artifact collectors continued to pick through the deposits and
backdirt piles, but for the most part no professional and avocational work took place at the
Merchant site for the following two decades.
1984: Fieldwork by John D. Speth
For several days in 1984, Dr. John D. Speth of the University of Michigan, together with his
father Alfred A. Speth, visited the site. On one of those days they were joined by Bus Leslie
who graciously answered many questions about the original excavations, the fate of the various
artifacts and faunal remains, whether the LCAS excavators had observed any charred corn or
other cultigens, the possible locations of other structures on the site, and so forth. A permanent
datum was established, and one of the more accurate site maps was produced (Figure 3.5). The
open LCAS excavations and features and overall state of the site was documented. A test unit
was excavated in a suspected pithouse, and a sample of the backdirt surrounding the two open pit
structure excavations was screened. The test unit (Unit 84-1) measured 0.5 m by 2.85 m and was
excavated to a depth of 30 cm below surface. The excavation revealed a probable pithouse
structure. The datum established by Speth was located during the 2015 fieldwork and was the
basis for the grid system used during the 2015 investigations.

1983-2009: Cultural Resource Management Surveys
The resurgence of oil and gas exploration throughout the Permian Basin during the early 1980s
and the accompanying requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) to identify and manage cultural resources on federal (BLM) lands led to a new series of
field investigations at the Merchant site. Archaeological surveys of seismic oil and gas
29

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

exploration lines provided new information and updates on the status of the Merchant site as well
as several surrounding sites.
Two surveys in 1983 recorded artifacts to the west of the village area excavated by Leslie and the
LCAS. A survey by New Mexico Archaeological Services, Inc. recorded several isolated finds
and burned caliche scatters to the north and west (Hunt 1983:2). A second survey by the Agency
for Conservation Archaeology of Eastern New Mexico University examined seismic lines
crossing to the north and south of the LCAS village area (Hankins and Proper 1983) and recorded
a single isolated find of a biface, three flakes, and Chupadero Black-on-white sherd below the
escarpment (Hankins and Proper 1983:2).
Two archaeological sites were recorded near the Merchant site during later surveys of the area.
In 1987, Pecos Archeological Consultants documented Site PAC/Le-042 (LA 65936) about
300 m northeast of the Merchant site. The site was recorded as camp with two eroded burned
caliche features and a scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts distributed over a 300 by 300 m area
(Hunt and Martin 1987). Another site, LCAS E-22 (LA 43416), had been recorded by Robert
Leslie, John Corley, and Calvin Smith about 150 m northeast of the Merchant site. The site
measured over 10 acres in size and contained burned rock scatters, debitage, notched arrow points
and dart points, brownwares, and Chupadero Black-on-white sherds. LA 43416 (PAC/LE-114)
was surveyed a second time and updated in 1990 by Pecos Archeological Consultants as part of a
seismic survey (Hunt 1990). The site was recorded as a 40 m by 40 m scatter of groundstone,
chert and quartzite chipped stone, Jornada Brownware, and thermally altered caliche.
In 1991 the Merchant site, along with three other sites in the vicinity, was again surveyed and
evaluated (Gregory 2001). At this time the status of the LCAS excavation area was documented.
The village area was recorded as a 65 m by 56 m area with two open pit structure excavations,
eleven surface rooms, and a bedrock mortar. A 1 percent sample of lithic, groundstone, and
ceramic artifacts were analyzed in the field (Gregory 2001:16-19). Based on the sample, it was
estimated that hundreds of artifacts were present on the site surface. The open pit structure
excavations and visible surface rooms were mapped and assigned a new series of feature numbers
(Figure 3.6). Features 1 and 2 were the open pit structure excavations, a bedrock mortar to the
south was designated Feature 3, and surface rooms were designated Features 4 through 14.
Later in the same year the Merchant site and nearby sites were again surveyed and evaluated in
advance of planned seismic surveys. At this time, the original designation of LA 43414 was
expanded to subsume the two previously recorded sites LA 43416 and LA 65936, located within
300 m of the LCAS village area and three newly defined areas of surface artifacts and features
(Seymour 2001:169-174). The aggregate site area was expanded to 875 m by 625 m. Six loci
were defined (Figure 3.7). Locus 1 was an area of scattered hearths and low-density artifact
scatters at the southern edge of the site. Locus 2 was the designation for the original LA 43414
and the LCAS village area – the Merchant site proper. Locus 3 was previously recorded LA
65936 at the northwestern corner of the site. Locus 4 was 100 m northwest of Locus 2 and
contained two pithouses and a dense artifact scatter. Locus 5 was located just to the south of
Locus 3. It covered a 50 m by 50 m area with a scatter of caliche cobbles described as four
surface rooms of limestone masonry, two of which had conjoined walls. Locus 6 covered a large
portion of the northeast edge of the site where LA 43416 had been recorded during previous
surveys.
The LCAS village area appears to have been mapped a second time during this survey (Gregory
2006). The positions and orientations of some of the domestic rooms were revised, and a new
series of room numbers was assigned (Figure 3.8).

The most recent survey took place in 2009 (Allison et al. 2009:24-27). The site documentation
maintained the six loci and aggregate site boundary of LA 43414 established during 1991 survey.
Recent surveys of pipeline corridors passed by the northern edge of LA 43414 (Brown and
Brown 2015; Mavrick 2013). Small numbers of isolated artifacts were recorded along the survey
corridors, but they were not sufficient in number or density to warrant expanding the site
boundary. The pipeline corridor was rerouted 150 m to the north, and construction monitoring
was recommended to prevent inadvertent damage to LA 43414.
Recent Research
The Merchant site has continued to be of interest to several researchers. Daniel Gregory, who
supervised the seismic surveys in 1991, completed his M.A. thesis at Eastern New Mexico
University on the chipped stone raw materials used by the inhabitants of the Merchant site and
other Ochoa phase settlements (Gregory 2006). Luis Alvarado (2008, 2009) included 28 sherds
of Ochoa Indented Corrugated obtained from John Speth’s 1984 collections at the Merchant site
in his neutron activation analysis study of corrugated wares in southeastern New Mexico. The
results are published in his 2008 M.A. thesis from Texas State University.
The most recent investigation at the Merchant site involved the collection of radiocarbon samples
from three features by the Carlsbad Field Office of the BLM. The samples were collected as part
of a larger Permian Basin research project designed to improve the chronology of southeastern
New Mexico (Scott Cummings and Kováčik 2013). Two radiocarbon samples were obtained
from a small hearth, one sample was collected from a large stain thought to be the pithouse tested
by John Speth in 1984, and one sample was retrieved from a small shovel test in the backdirt
surrounding the open LCAS excavation of Pit Structure 1. The samples and radiocarbon age
estimates are reviewed in Chapter Nine.

The Work Plan and Research Design
Thus was the status of the Merchant site and LA 43414 as of 2015 when the contract for
documentation and remedial mitigation was awarded to VersarGMI. Several issues regarding the
status of the LCAS excavations, whether any features or deposits remained intact at the site, and
whether the LCAS village was related in some manner to the larger aggregate site area of LA
43414, were all unresolved. Given the undisputable significance of the site for southeastern New
Mexico prehistory – and likely Plains and Southwest prehistory as well – the BLM had a clear
statutory and scientific mandate to investigate, evaluate, remediate, and preserve the site.
Fortunately, the Permian Basin Programmatic Agreement provided a contracting and funding
vehicle that allowed them to satisfy that mandate.
Introduction to the Work Plan
The Merchant Site (LA 43414), a fourteenth to early fifteenth century village in southeastern
New Mexico, was investigated by the Lea County Archeological Society (LCAS) between 1959
and 1965 (Leslie 1965a, n.d.). The excavations were not backfilled and no comprehensive report
was produced. The architecture and material culture of this important site, as well as its social
and economic role in the prehistory of southeastern New Mexico and the greater Southwest and
southern Plains, remains poorly-known.
The site was the subject of continual uncontrolled looting before, after, and even during the
LCAS excavations (Leslie n.d.) and the condition of the features suffered accordingly. To make
matters worse, the LCAS artifact collections were lost when Robert Leslie’s artifact collections
and archives were disposed of after his death. In 1984, Dr. John Speth mapped the site, took
notes on the condition of the LCAS excavations and features, excavated a test unit in a suspected
pithouse, and screened a sample of the backdirt from the LCAS excavations around two large
pithouses. Additional investigations include Daniel Gregory’s (2006) thesis on raw material
34

Chapter Three
History of Investigations, Research Design, and Field Methods

types present in the chipped stone assemblage and Luis Alvarado’s (2008) thesis on neutron
activation analysis of ceramics from southeast New Mexico and the southern Plains that included
a sample of Ochoa Indented ceramics from the Merchant site. The site and surrounding area have
been surveyed several times for seismic lines (Gregory 2001; Seymour 2001). More recently, the
CFO collected soil and plant samples from backdirt piles and submitted four samples for
radiocarbon dating.
Architecture: The LCAS investigations identified 21 small, square pithouses or rooms with stone
foundations and two large pit structures. Several of the surface structures were contiguous. The
dimensions and morphology of the two large pit structures (Structures 1 and 2) are uncertain due
to the manner in which they were excavated and, as Leslie (n.d.) notes, the continual destruction
of the floors and walls by looters who dug the site during his absence. Floor features such as
hearths and roof support postholes, were rare among the small rooms. Hearths and postholes
were present in the large structures, but it is difficult to determine their morphology.
Fill deposits had evidence of multiple strata and possibly two floors, and deposits of refuse were
present, including a 12-inch (30 cm) thick layer of large mammal bones in the fill of Structure 1.
It appears that both structures were remodeled and reoccupied at least once.
The presence of both small rooms and large, subsurface structures measuring approximately 6 m
in length is intriguing. The two architectural forms may represent different occupational periods.
However, Leslie’s descriptions of the houses as large, rectangular structures are reminiscent of
community architecture typical of pueblo settlements to the west in the Sierra Blanca, Roswell,
Chupadera Mesa, and Jornada regions. The possibility that one or both structures served as
communal rooms or kivas was an important consideration, and the proposed excavation strategy
was intended to evaluate this possibility. The presence of community architecture at the
Merchant site has important implications for social organization, settlement function, and
connections with, or origins from, areas to the west.
Material Culture: The ceramics assemblages of the Merchant site and other Ochoa phase
settlements consist primarily of Ochoa wares (Ochoa Indented Corrugated, Plain Polished,
Corrugated, and smudged varieties). A NAA analysis of a sample of Ochoa Indented Corrugated
sherds from the site identified a distinct chemical compositional group that likely confirms the
ceramics were being manufactured at or near the site (Alvarado 2008; Miller and Ferguson 2014).
Other ceramics documented by Leslie and others include El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Blackon-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, Lincoln Black-on-red, Ramos Polychrome, Gila
Polychrome, Rio Grande Glaze A, Playas Incised, Roswell Brown, and an unidentified polished
and incised black ceramic (Leslie n.d.). Ochoa Indented Corrugated accounted for approximately
95 percent of the assemblage.
According to Leslie’s manuscript, animal bone was plentiful, although there was some concern
that most of the assemblage was lost or degraded after having been excavated and discarded in
backdirt deposits. Large mammals, lagomorphs, and bird bones were reported by Leslie (1965a).
One of the more intriguing finds was the 12-inch layer of large mammal bones deposited in the
fill of Structure 1. Refuse deposits usually have bone, ceramics, and other materials mixed
throughout the layers, but in this case the presence of such a dense and discrete deposit suggests it
may have been deposited after a feast or during the ritual closure and termination of the house
(which, of course, may have involved a communal feast). It was hoped that some remnant or
evidence of this deposit could be reconstructed to evaluate if it was a ritual deposit or feasting
event. However, the 2015 excavations determined that none of the interior stratigraphy of the
two pit structures remained intact.
Mussel shell was also noted, suggesting riverine environments were exploited by the inhabitants.
Charred acorns and mesquite seeds were recovered. Leslie (1965a) states that no corn was
35

The Merchant Site

recovered, but CFO archaeologists recovered a corn cupule from a hearth near the settlement.
The variety of animal and plant foods indicates that the inhabitants had a diverse subsistence
economy.
Leslie notes that several thousand projectile points were recovered by the LCAS and looters.
Leslie (n.d.) identified 13 types among the collection, and whether the variety of types was due to
functional uses or social factors was an interesting topic for consideration during the analysis of
the site. Other artifacts include groundstone, a variety of formal unifacial and bifacial flaked
stone tools, Olivella shell beads, carved and notched bone, and stone, shell, and ochre pendants.
The Merchant Site and the Prehistory of Southeast New Mexico
The Merchant site is representative of the Ochoa phase (A.D. 1300–1450) and represents an
atypical residential settlement in southeastern New Mexico, a region dominated by mobile
hunter-gatherer groups. The presence of such a site gives rise to several research questions. The
research questions involve multiple scales ranging from human adaptations to the local
environment of southeast New Mexico to the nature of the social groups that inhabited the site
and their relationships to broad patterns of social and economic interaction that took place across
the southern Southwest and southern Plains during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There
appears to be a distinctive blend of Plains and Southwest material culture, technology, and social
organization at the Merchant site. There is a strong hunting tradition evident in the chipped stone
tools and technology, while there are also intriguing architectural hints suggesting social
organization based on Southwestern traditions of communal architecture. Of course, the different
house forms may also be associated with multiple occupations. Ceramics and marine shell
indicate economic and social contacts with groups to the west in the Jornada and Salinas region.
The possibility that the site represents an actual migration of people from one of those western
regions must be considered given our current knowledge of widespread population movements
across the Southwest.
Unfortunately, it has been difficult or impossible to address these and other questions in full
because of the loss of information from the site and the variable quality of what little information
has been published (Leslie 1965a). The studies by Gregory (2006) and Alvarado (2008)
contributed important insights but were limited to material culture and could not reconcile the
confusing details on the architecture and other aspects of the site. The investigations proposed by
the CFO under the Permian Basin PA and described by VersarGMI in the following discussions
were designed to remedy this situation. Ultimately, the overarching goal of the project was to
allow the Merchant site to take its rightful place among the signature prehistoric settlements of
southern New Mexico.

The Scope of Work
To preface the discussion of the work plan and overall goals of the project, it must be emphasized
that the project was intended as a remedial mitigation effort. Some of the tasks and goals of
conventional mitigation and data recovery projects were set aside or accorded a secondary status
to the primary goal of examining and stabilizing the LCAS excavation areas, including the open
excavation units in the two pit structures.
The Scope of Work issued by the CFO listed 21 tasks. The tasks were organized under four
categories: (1) documentation; (2) remediation; (3) analysis and interpretation; and (4) public
outreach and education.

36

Documentation
Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 together composed an integrated approach to documenting the site and
establishing the foundation for subsequent intensive excavation, management and protective
procedures, and interpretations.
Task 1: TRU Survey and Site Boundary Definitions: The most recent characterization of the
Merchant site (LA 43414) defined in 1991 by Lone Mountain Archaeological Consultants Inc.
(Gregory 2001; Seymour 2001) consisted of the surface room and pithouse settlement originally
investigated by the LCAS, two previously recorded sites (LA 43416 and LA 65936), and three
loci of artifacts, hearths, and structural features. The site boundary listed on the 2009 and 2001
site forms measures 875 m north/south by 625 m east/west (546,875 square meters [135 acres]),
although the actual site area is smaller due to the narrow width of the southern half of the site.
The boundary subsumes the six loci (previously and newly recorded site areas) that are separated
from each other by distances of 60 to 400 meters. The area of the LCAS excavations and original
definition of LA 43414 were designated as Locus 2. Locus 3 is LA 65936, Locus 6 is LA 43416,
and Loci 1, 4 and 5 are feature and artifact areas recorded during the 2001 LMAS survey and
included in the overall site. No justification was provided in the LMAS report for combining the
previously recorded sites and newly identified loci into a single site.
Task 1 stipulated that a Transect Recording Unit (TRU) survey was to be conducted to evaluate
artifact distributions and the spatial and temporal relationships of the LCAS excavations and
other five loci comprising LA 43414 (see Chapter Four for a description of the TRU survey
method). Assuming a buffer area around the site and a rectangular TRU grid placed over the
2001 and 2009 site boundaries, an estimated 350,000 square meters (86 acres) was to be surveyed
using the TRU method. The entire 86-acre site was surveyed so that all six loci and intervening
spaces could be evaluated. In addition, the 86-acre survey allowed the TRU survey to be
correlated with the aerial photography and contour mapping (see Task 3 below).
Two modifications of the standard TRU methods were made to meet the requirements of Task 1.
First, the standard 15-x-15-m cell size utilized at Fort Bliss Military Reservation was reduced to
10-x-10-m cells for LA 43414. Second, the distance criterion for defining site boundaries was
modified. The GIS program using the 15-m distance criterion used to define and separate sites at
Fort Bliss was modified to use the 20-meter distance criterion for site definition as specified in
Chapter 1 Section A.6.b.2 of BLM Manual H-8100-1.
Beyond the basic TRU survey, an additional component of the investigation was to examine the
relationship of the structural features reported in Locus 3, 4, and 5 with those in the LCAS
settlement area of Locus 2. Additional surface structures had been reported for Locus 3 and 5,
and two pithouse depressions were described in Locus 3.
Task 2: EDM Mapping of the LCAS Excavation Area: A plan map of the LCAS excavation area
(Locus 2) was created using an electronic distance measurement (EDM) total station. An area of
approximately 1,700 square meters was mapped. Architectural features, hearths and other
features, excavations and backdirt piles from the LCAS investigations, and artifact distributions
were plotted. A permanent mapping datum was established (Speth’s 1984 site datum), georeferenced, and tied to the UTM grid of the TRU survey. The subdatum points of excavation
units were mapped during excavations. The total station was also used to maintain vertical
provenience during hand excavations.
Task 3: Topographic map of LA 43414: Prior to commencing with hand excavations,
VersarGMI and Archaeo-Geophysical Associates (AGA) conducted an intensive, low-altitude,
high-resolution aerial photography and three-dimensional contour mapping of the entire 86-acre
area of LA 43414. The data were designed to be presentable as both two-dimensional (2D) GIS
37

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

importable ortho-rectified images as well as textured three-dimensional (3D) contour models.
The natural setting of the site and other attributes are available for study using the high-resolution
aerial imagery. The aerial photogrammetry provided a high-resolution (up to 1 cm contour)
topographic map of the entire site and high-resolution aerial photographs of the site, prehistoric
features, and excavation areas.
Mapping was calibrated to a vertical contour resolution of 2 cm for the LCAS area (Locus 2) and
5 to 10 cm for the remainder of LA 43414. This level of resolution was possible through
advances in aerial photography and photogrammetry that allow for the collection and processing
of extremely high resolution low altitude aerial imagery. Using aerial platforms such as
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or “drones”) a number of transects could be flown across the
site while a series of overlapping digital photos were collected. While the individual highresolution photographs are useful for archaeological research, the added power of these
techniques lies in the ability to extract both 3D and orthographic data from the imagery. The
enhanced aerial techniques provided a means to examine LA 43414 and its landscape setting in
an unbiased fashion. The photographic and photogrammetric data revealed subtle variations in
the ground surface indicating the presence of buried pithouses, surface rooms and walls, and pits.
Furthermore, the datasets could be incorporated directly into a GIS system, thus allowing for the
information collected from the TRU survey and total data station (TDS) mapping to be layered
with the aerial imagery and contour maps.
For purposes of long-term management and preservation, one of the most important benefits to
the BLM of the proposed aerial photography and contour mapping was its potential as a
monitoring tool. The data provide a snapshot of LA 43414 during a single point in time in 2015.
Since the data contains both 3D and aerial imagery, it can be used to examine how the site
changes over time as a result of erosion, looting, damage by oil or seismic exploration, or
recreational use. It can also allow for the detailed exploration of information on the amount of fill
that has been added or removed from an area; something useful for exploring damage caused by
looting.
Task 4: Remote Sensing of Possible Pithouse Locations: The location of a suspected pithouse
and surface room features were surveyed using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The designated
location was where John Speth identified a possible buried structure in Unit 84-1. Unit 84-1 and
the suspected pithouse are located approximately 18 m northeast and across the dirt road from
LCAS Room 7. The two locations of possible houses were surveyed with GPR and the results are
reviewed in Chapter Four.
Remediation
Remediation involved the tasks designed to mitigate or reduce the impacts of the LCAS
investigations and the uncontrolled looting of the 1950s and 1960s and clarify features identified
during subsequent studies of the site by John Speth in 1984 and recent visits by BLM
archaeologists. Remediation tasks included Tasks 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11. As with the
documentation tasks, the group of remediation tasks were viewed as an integrated strategy
intended to mitigate impacts to the site from the looting and LCAS excavations and to extract
information from those investigations.
Task 5: Surface Collection and Re-Excavation of Two LCAS Pithouse Structures: Task 5 had
two components: collection of surface artifacts from the LCAS excavation area and reexcavation of two pit structures investigated by the LCAS.
As part of Task 5[a] all surface artifacts were to be collected from the approximate 1,700 square
meter area of the LCAS investigations. The majority of artifacts were exposed in backdirt piles
surrounding Pit Structures 1 and 2, but recent surveys noted additional artifacts around the
38

Chapter Three
History of Investigations, Research Design, and Field Methods

surface structures, extramural areas, and refuse areas. Concentrations of artifacts eroding from
backdirt piles were to be collected within 2-x-2 m provenience units tied to the TRU grid. This
task was modified and reduced in scope. Based on prior sample collections (Gregory 2001;
Seymour 2001), it was estimated that approximately 2,800 artifacts would be present on the
surface. None of the prior surveys mentioned the large numbers of animal bone in midden
deposits. The 2015 collection was initiated on the backdirt mound surrounding Pit Structure 1.
The surface collection involved twenty-two 2 m x 2 m units (88 square meters) and recovered a
total count of 1,089 bones and 345 artifacts. The 1,434 artifacts represented over 50 percent of
the total artifact count anticipated for the site but was obtained from less than 10 percent of the
1,700 square meter site area. Clearly, the numbers of surface artifacts far exceeded the counts
documented during the recent professional surveys. Accordingly, the task was modified and only
chronologically and technologically diagnostic artifacts were plotted and collected from the
village area. Substantial samples of all artifact classes were recovered from the subsurface
excavations.
Task 5[b] was one of the more critical investigations of the project. Pit Structure 1 and Pit
Structure 2 were unusual in that they were both exceptionally large and deep structures.
Determining the nature and social function of these structures was one of the most important
research issues for understanding the nature of the Merchant site and social organization of its
inhabitants.
The LCAS excavations and failure to backfill those excavations presented several problems for
excavation and interpretation. Leslie’s (n.d.) notes provided a different measurement for Pit
Structure 1 (16 by 18 feet) than illustrated in the LCAS article (20 feet diameter). Leslie noted
that excavators dug through and beyond the walls, a fact that may explain the size discrepancy. If
so, it was possible that the walls of the structure no longer existed and the dimensions would have
to be extrapolated from remnants of the floor. Shovel testing within the central backfill of the
structures by CFO archaeologists found that 20 to 30 cm of deposits were present above the
apparent floor levels.
The remediation of the two pit structures involved a full excavation of the interior fills (consisting
mostly of screened deposits from the surrounding backdirt mounds washed into the open
excavations), a search for remnant fill strata, walls and floors, and documentation of the
architectural attributes.
Task 6: Screening of LCAS Backdirt: Photographs of LCAS avocational members excavating
the Merchant site show that they utilized screens. However, given that counts of animal bone and
chipped stone debitage were not mentioned in the notes or manuscripts, it was concluded that the
screening process involved the collection of projectile points, ceramics, groundstone and formal
stone tools, and miscellaneous items such as marine shell. Most of the chipped stone debitage
and cores, small ceramics, and small bone were apparently discarded with the backdirt. The mass
of faunal material recovered from the stratum in Pit Structure 1 was dumped over the side of the
escarpment. In light of the evident collection bias, the screening of the LCAS and looter backdirt
piles could provide useful, albeit biased, assemblages of ceramics and chipped-stone debitage that
could partially compensate for the near total loss of artifact assemblages from the LCAS
investigations.
Task 6 was completed prior to Task 5b. Backdirt piles surrounding Pit Structure 1 and 2 were
screened prior to re-excavating the structures. Upon commencing with the excavation of the
backdirt mound surrounding Pit Structure 1, it was soon discovered that the refuse deposits at the
Merchant site have some of the highest densities of artifacts and animal bone recorded in
southern New Mexico. Moreover, the volumes of the backdirt deposits across the site had been
underestimated. New volumetric calculations estimated that counts of over 100,000 and perhaps
39

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

reaching 200,000 artifacts were present among the 130 square meters of backdirt deposits across
the site. Acknowledging the cost and curation burdens of such artifact quantities, the CFO
modified the task to include sample excavations of the four major backdirt deposits: Pit
Structure 1, Pit Structure 2, Refuse Area A, and Refuse Area B.
Task 8: Definition of Two Possible Pithouses Identified by the CFO: CFO archaeologists
identified two possible pithouse features within or near the periphery of the LCAS excavations.
A charred maize cupule was collected from one feature located northeast of the LCAS excavation
area. The second feature is located southeast of the LCAS area and has a depth of at least 40 cm.
The second feature may be the pithouse tested by John Speth in 1984 (see Task 9 below). The
possible pithouse tested by Speth was surveyed using GPR as part of Task 4. The two features
were investigated by excavating a 50-cm wide hand trench across the long axis. The profile
established the horizontal and vertical extent of each feature and revealed whether they were
pithouses, borrow pits with refuse fills, natural depressions filled with cultural deposits, or some
other feature. The stratigraphy was documented and nature of the fill deposits (natural, cultural
refuse) were described. The presence or absence of floor and subfloor features was documented
and this information assisted in determining whether the features were habitation structures.
Task 9: Definition of Possible Pithouse Identified by John Speth in 1984: Dr. Speth visited the
Merchant site in 1984 and identified a possible buried structure in a hand-excavated test trench
designated as Unit 84-1 (Speth n.d.). The unit measured 2.85 by 0.5 m and identified a possible
floor overlaid by a fill deposit of refuse. Unit 84-1 and the suspected house were located
approximately 18 m northeast and across the dirt road from LCAS Room 7. Once Speth’s site
datum was located, the location of Unit 84-1 could be identified with confidence. The location of
the pithouse and Room 7 were surveyed using GPR. Excavations determined that the possible
pithouse identified by the CFO to the southeast of the LCAS excavation area (Task 8) and the
Speth pithouse were the same feature. The feature was test excavated using the same method as
described for Task 8 above.
Task 10: EDM Post-Excavation Mapping of the LCAS Excavation Area: Upon completion of the
remedial excavation tasks, the LCAS area was be mapped a second time with the EDM. The
locations of new excavation units (including units excavated during previous investigations) and
newly discovered features were added to the previous mapping data. Subdatum points of
excavation units were plotted. All units, features, and datum points were geo-referenced to UTM
coordinates. An archaeological planview map of the LCAS village area was produced showing
the LCAS and VersarGMI excavations, habitation structures, and other cultural features.
Task 11: Backfilling of Excavation Units and Features: Upon completion of the excavation
work, the final remediation task was to backfill all features and deep excavation units with natural
and sterile caliche. The floors of the two pit structures and base levels of excavation units were
covered with filter cloth prior to backfilling. The caliche was obtained from a borrow pit located
on BLM lands near the site.
Analysis and Interpretation
Analysis and interpretation tasks included attempts to obtain artifact collections from professional
and avocational archaeologists, artifact collectors, museums, and other sources. Artifact
assemblages were catalogued, and certain artifacts and samples were submitted to specialist
laboratories for analysis. A small excavation and geomorphological study were intended to help
interpret areas of the site beyond the LCAS area. Analytical and interpretive tasks include Tasks
7, 12, 13, 14, and 15. In addition, an unspecified task involved some level of analysis of ceramic,
chipped stone, and ground stone artifacts and subsistence remains.

Task 7: Analysis of Faunal Collections: Animal bone collected during excavations was
subjected to a technical analysis. Specimens were identified to the highest resolution taxonomic
level possible. The number of individual specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals
(MNI) of species identified in the assemblages were reported by major provenience. Cultural
modifications such as burning, crushing, and cut marks were monitored and post-depositional and
taphonomic modifications were evaluated. The combined information from Leslie’s notes,
excavated specimens, and curated collections was studied and compared to other assemblages of
similar periods in southeast New Mexico. Dr. Speth reviewed the analysis results and compared
them to his database of 60,000 faunal specimens from southeast New Mexico, including
Henderson, Bloom Mound, Rocky Arroyo, and Fox Place. Procurement, butchering, food
preparation, and consumption patterns were reviewed.
Task 13: Public Announcement to Solicit Information: Despite Leslie’s commendable efforts to
establish some form of systematic excavation and controlled artifact recovery during the LCAS
excavations at the Merchant site (see Leslie n.d.), several LCAS members kept artifact collections
from the site or participated in uncontrolled excavations during Leslie’s absence. In an attempt to
locate and document such collections, VersarGMI in consultation with the CFO, developed and
issued public announcements requesting information on privately held collections by former
members of the LCAS or their families. Local print and visual media were contacted.
Task 12: Integrating Private and Institutional Artifact Collections: One of the great losses for
the archaeological research of southeastern New Mexico was the disposal and loss of Bus Leslie’s
collections and notes, including the artifact collections from the Merchant site. Several LCAS
members who participated in the Merchant site excavations retained some of the collections and
Task 13 above outlined the efforts made to contact them. Materials from the 1984 investigations
were also available for review through Dr. Speth.
Task 14: Geomorphological and Palynological Investigation of Alluvial Terrace: Dr. Charles
Frederick conducted a geomorphological investigation of the alluvial terrace below the
escarpment and the Merchant site. This task was modified to include geomorphological
investigations of possible agricultural terraces found in the northcentral area of LA 43414.
Fieldwork included a pedestrian reconnaissance followed by two days of exploration with a
backhoe and a single day of sampling. Four backhoe trenches were excavated, one of which was
an off-site control trench. A basic suite of laboratory work (including particle size/texture,
magnetic susceptibility, calcium carbonate content and organic matter content) was used to
document the physical properties of each alluvial deposit. Palynological examination for
evidence of past maize agriculture included samples collected from suspected agricultural
features and off-site control columns.
Task 15: Document Features in Locus 1: This task involved limited investigations in one of the
loci (Locus 1) incorporated into LA 43414 when the site boundaries were expanded during the
2001 LMAS survey. Several hearths and burned rock features were identified in Locus 1 during
the LMAS survey. Two of the features were excavated during the 2015 fieldwork.
Unnumbered Task – Analysis of Architecture, Artifact Assemblages, Chronology, and
Subsistence Remains: Some analyses of material culture were stipulated in the contract issued
by the CFO. A provision for XRF sourcing of obsidian artifacts was mentioned in Task 12. Task
15 required that radiocarbon, macrobotanical, phytolith, and starch residue samples be collected
and submitted from the two features in Locus 1 and that the results of these analyses are
incorporated into the report. Task 7 required a detailed analysis of faunal remains. Task 14
included the submission of chronometric dates, pollen samples, and sediment samples for
analysis.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

In addition to these analyses, VersarGMI proposed additional studies to assist in the study and
interpretation of the Merchant site. The primary goal of the project was to remediate the impacts
and effects of the LCAS investigations and illicit looting activities that took place during the
1950s and 1960s and to document and stabilize the site for management and preservation by the
CFO. However, the project was also an important opportunity to learn more about one of the
most unique and significant sites in southeast New Mexico. This goal would also enhance the
public outreach and education efforts set forth in Tasks 17, 18, and 19.
With these goals in mind, VersarGMI conducted additional analyses and studies. The
architecture was compared against architectural trends in adjacent regions, including the
Chupadero Mesa, Salinas and Sierra Blanca region, Roswell area, Jornada Mogollon, and
southern Plains. Chronometric dating and relative chronological indicators (ceramics and
projectile points) were used to determine if the large subsurface structures (Pit Structures 1 and
2), smaller surface structures, and possible pithouses identified by the CFO and Speth are
contemporaneous or represent two or more occupation periods. Leslie’s field notes and the
VersarGMI re-excavation data were carefully reviewed to evaluate the function of Pit Structures
1 and 2 as possible communal architecture. Additional flotation and pollen samples were
submitted from the pit structures and other contexts. Ceramic artifacts recovered during
fieldwork were analyzed and assigned to types. Representative examples were digitally
photographed. The ceramic assemblage was evaluated for potential compositional analysis and
recommendations are offered for future NAA and petrographic analyses. Projectile points were
photographed and assigned to current typologies. The Leslie (1978) typology will be examined
and correlated with current types as described by Justice (2002) and others working in southeast
New Mexico (Miller and Graves 2012; Adler and Speth 2004; Wiseman 2002). Chipped stone
debitage will be counted by type (flake, core, and shatter).
Task 16: Report of Investigations: The final analysis and interpretation task is the production of
the formal report of investigations for the Merchant site.
Public Outreach and Education
The final series of tasks were designed to increase public awareness of the site, the Permian Basin
program, and the issues surrounding looted sites on public lands.
Task 17: Creation of a Public Booklet or Brochure for the Public Outreach: VersarGMI
produced a 14-page booklet for public distribution. The nature of the Merchant site, the past and
present investigations, and the things we were able to learn about prehistoric lifeways in southeast
New Mexico from these investigations were presented in the brochure. In addition, the brochure
fully acknowledged and credited the CFO and Permian Basin PA for their support. The booklet
also included a subtle and non-confrontational discussion of the damage resulting from
uncontrolled and illicit looting of sites. As recommended by the CFO, the discussion addressed
the topics of looting, the loss of artifacts and context, and ultimately how we lose a piece of our
past and history that belongs to all citizens.
Task 18: Poster Presentation at a Professional Conference: This task recommended a poster
presentation at a professional conference. Instead, a mini-session consisting of four professional
papers was organized for the 2015 Biennial Jornada Mogollon Conference held in El Paso Texas.
Four papers were presented: An overview of the recent excavations and discoveries at the
Merchant site (Miller, Graves, and Speth), remote sensing investigations (Willis and Walker), the
possible agricultural features (Frederick, Willis, Graves, and Miller), and a preliminary review of
the faunal analysis (Loven).

Task 19: Public Lectures on the Merchant Site: VersarGMI presented a series of public lectures
on the past and present investigations at the Merchant site in Carlsbad, Artesia, Lovington, and
Hobbs, New Mexico, during the month of September 2016.
Task 20: Curation: All artifacts, samples, field notes, photographs, and maps were be curated at
the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe.
Task 21: Digital Files: A digital copy (PDF or other format) of the final report and the final
approved public education booklet was filed with the Digital Archaeological Record
(www.tDAR.org). The digital copy was redacted so that locational information on the Merchant
site was removed.

2015 Excavation Field Methods
Field methods specific to TRU survey, mapping, remote sensing, and other tasks are described in
Chapter Four. Excavation field methods were as follows:
Most excavation areas (pit structures, refuse areas, pithouses, hearths, or agricultural features)
were excavated in 1 m by 1 m or 1 m by 0.5 m subunits for horizontal control tied into 1984
WGS UTM coordinates for Speth’s 1984 site datum. The corners of excavation units were shot
in with an Electronic Distance Measuring (EDM) transit from that primary site datum. The field
coordinates were corrected to the New Mexico base coordinates in the laboratory.
One exception was the excavation and areas of the backdirt mound at the southern and eastern
sides of Pit Structure 1. Since the entire deposit was a completely mixed and disturbed mass of
previously excavated and screened fill from the structure, the excavation unit in the mound was
excavated as a single level and provenience. In contrast, the excavation units in other refuse
areas, such as Refuse Areas A and B, could have been located in undisturbed prehistoric deposits,
therefore they were excavated within controlled subunits and arbitrary levels.
All excavations were linked into a rebar datum near the excavation block and arbitrarily
designated an elevation of 100.00. Measurements were then taken from this arbitrary level
decreasing in elevation from the surface elevations. The exception was that the same datum used
for Refuse Area B was also used for the Pit Structure 2 excavation. The rebar subdatum points
were tied to the master site datum. Arbitrary 10-cm levels were maintained in undifferentiated
refuse and natural deposits. However, upon verifying that deposits within and surrounding the
two pit structures consisted of mixed and previously screened deposits, these units were
excavated in single arbitrary levels until a different form of deposit, a floor, or other form of
natural or cultural stratigraphic marker was encountered. All fill was screened through ⅛-inch
mesh with the exception of the massive and artifact-rich backdirt deposits in Pit Structures 1 and
2. These deposits were excavated using ¼-inch mesh, although samples of levels and units were
screened through ⅛-inch mesh to provide estimates of small bones and debitage.
By far, the excavation of the two pit structures was the most complex and demanding task. The
standard excavation procedure for the structures was to expose and define their limits in planview
by clearing the surface and defining the interior size and stratigraphy through the excavation of
trenches crossing the axis of the structure. Each structure was hand excavated through a 1-m
wide trench (divided into 1-m subunits) placed through the central axis. The trench began at least
one meter beyond the limits of the LCAS excavation in order to confirm that no walls or
structural segments existed beyond the LCAS exposures. The excavation trenches provided
profile exposures across each structure and allowed for any remnants of walls, floors, and
subfloor features to be identified. When necessary, a second trench was placed perpendicular to
the first trench.

43

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Once the reference points of floor or multiple floors, walls, and subfloor features were identified,
hand excavations proceeded to remove the interior fills. These fills consisted almost entirely of
backwashed backdirt spoil from the LCAS and looter backdirt mounds surrounding each
structure. Some remnants of floors and thin fill deposits were encountered. An attempt was
made to correlate the natural and cultural stratigraphy in the structures with the numerous strata
described in Leslie’s manuscript. However, this proved impossible since almost all the original
fill deposits had been removed during the excavations of 1959-1965.
Floors were cleared and carefully examined to identify subfloor features. Considering the size of
the structures, it was anticipated that remnants of primary support postholes and other subfloor
features might remain intact. If the structures had served as civic architecture (kiva, communal
room), special ritual features such as benches, subfloor caches, floor grooves, and sipapus could
be present. Accordingly, particular attention was paid to identifying ritual stratigraphy and ritual
deposits in floor and subfloor contexts. Such deposits could include objects such as fossils,
crystals, or minerals placed in subfloor pits or marine shell in dedicatory pits or below primary
postholes. The identification of such deposits would assist in interpreting whether the deep pit
structures served as civic architecture associated with the surface rooms. Upon completion of the
excavations, the structures were mapped in plan and profile and photographed. Levels below the
floors were probed, but sterile caliche conglomerate was encountered below each structure with
the exception of the southwestern corner of Pit Structure 2 where a deep caliche pipe or cultural
pit was encountered.

The Theoretical Background of the Merchant Site Investigations
Contrary to the usual practice of data recovery projects, a formal theoretical research program
was not developed for the present investigation. The fundamental intent of the project was to
remediate the damage and unconsolidated features and deposits of this remote site some five
decades after it had been excavated and looted. In addition to re-excavating, stabilizing, and
preserving the archaeological record of the Merchant site and LA 43414, the main goal was to
evaluate the site for its past and present research potential—but not to actually perform research
based on the site, its features, and its material culture. As noted above, with the exception of
faunal bone, attribute and technological analyses of ceramics, groundstone, flaked stone, and
other artifact classes were not included in the scope of work issued by the CFO. Other goals of
the project included a broader documentation and evaluation of LA 43414 for the purpose of
long-term management and preservation and public outreach.
Moreover, much of the information regarding the site and its material culture remained very
poorly known during the early stages of project design. Few researchers and CRM managers had
access to Leslie’s unpublished manuscript, and few were aware of Leslie’s archive of black-andwhite and color slide photographs.
While the preceding discussion might give the impression that the project was atheoretical in
scope, design, and performance, this would be an entirely inaccurate conception. The Merchant
site and Ochoa phase have been considered in several regional studies and syntheses (Boyd 1997;
Corley 1965; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wiseman 2000, 2009), including the Permian Basin
Regional Research Design (Hogan 2006). All who were involved with the project recognized the
potential significance of the Merchant site for understanding Late Prehistoric adaptation and
social evolution on the southern Plains. Moreover, it was hoped that data on architecture and
material culture might lend insight to the debates over whether certain cultural “complexes” in
southeastern New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, and central Texas reflected hunter-gatherers
adopting Southwestern agricultural and technological practices or migrants from the Southwest
moving to the Plains and adopting hunting strategies and associated tool technologies from extant
Plains groups. Or perhaps something more complex took place, involving movement of groups
into multi-ethnic communities that forged new forms of social identity. These related questions
were in the forefront during the fieldwork, laboratory studies, and production of this report, and
are reviewed in greater depth in the summary chapter.
44

Chapter Three
History of Investigations, Research Design, and Field Methods

The general theoretical perspective guiding the archaeological investigations at the Merchant site
was one expressed by Miller and Church (2009) for broader application throughout the Jornada
region of southern New Mexico. It is essentially an integration of several theoretical perspectives
rather than a focus on a single explanatory approach. This view is based on the recognition that
no single theory can achieve the goal of explaining prehistoric human behavior, social dynamics,
ecological adaptation, or cultural change and evolution, and that multiple perspectives can
enhance our understanding of the prehistoric settlement and material remains at the Merchant site.
Schiffer (1999: 167) perhaps best expresses this sentiment:
Given the wide range of current questions, we must acknowledge that theories from
diverse programs are needed to help answer them….No theoretical program in
archaeology – or elsewhere in the sciences – is comprehensive when it comes to
explaining variability and change in human behavior. [Emphasis in original]
The research perspective advocated for the Merchant site investigations derived many of its
foundational concepts from Processual archaeology. Behavioral archaeology formed another
critical component. The study of abandonment processes and ritual behavior in certain modes of
abandonment also provided several concepts for interpreting the archaeological remains at the
Merchant site. Social factors– long neglected by the focus on processual and cultural-ecological
models in the Jornada region and southeastern New Mexico–have been placed at the forefront;
concerns with social power, ritual, and internal social dynamics have been fully incorporated into
the processual agenda of culture change and adaptation, or what Hegmon (2003) refers to as
“processual plus.” It is an explicitly pragmatic approach and one that best incorporates the
extensive information on the ecological, behavioral and, more recently, the social dimensions of
prehistory as summarized below:
… to deny the role of environmental and ecological foundations of human technology
and social organization would be unrealistic. In turn, to gloss over or discount the
influence of human agency on culture change would be equally unwise. It is the
dynamic interplay between environment, ecology, and human agency that perhaps best
reveals the underlying processes of culture change and should thus be the focus of
analysis.
Recalling Schiffer’s admonition that no one theory can adequately explain the totality
of human culture and behavior, it is suggested that the most productive means of
advancing archaeological theory and method in [southeastern] New Mexico would
involve the adoption of several perspectives. These would be used to mutually
reinforce and support each other rather than to critique and discredit each other. The
research agenda envisioned under these criteria is best described as follows: a scientific
processual program, with its foundational archaeological observations and assumptions
strengthened by behavioral archaeology and human behavioral ecology, along with an
explicit consideration of the transformative role of social and ideological formations in
culture change and evolution [Miller and Church 2009:4-15, brackets added].
Another specific theoretical perspective guided one component of the research. Contemporary
archaeological theory on movement, migration, and coalescent communities was considered,
using the studies, models, and interpretations presented by Clark (2001), Duff (1998), Lyons
(2003), Mills (2011), and Ortman and Cameron (2011), to cite just a small sample of the
representative literature on the subject. It is possible that the structural remains and material
culture at the Merchant site reflect migration from pueblo settlements to the west, or a Plains
group from the east, or reflects an indigenous population strongly influenced by social
conventions of the Southwestern pueblo world, or a combination of the two with a pueblo

45

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

population merging with a resident hunter-gatherer group of the southern Plains. All of these
situations would have involved a high level of group movement.
One more perspective merits discussion: the role of public education and outreach. While more
of a contemporary concept rather than an anthropological/archaeological “theory,” it is still an
important issue. It is a contemporary idea regarding the relevance and importance of
archaeology, prehistory, and cultural resources management to the public and other stakeholders
in the Section 106 process, and the critical role of public outreach and engagement to demonstrate
such relevance and to “spread the gospel” to a broader range of interested parties and
stakeholders. Several tasks set forth on the RFP issued by the CFO involve public and
professional lectures and publications. Summaries of these tasks were reviewed in the list of
tasks above.
Regional Research Problems
The Regional Research Design (RRD) for southeastern New Mexico (Hogan 2006) sets forth
three primary research domains: Chronology and Culture History, Subsistence Strategies, and
Settlement Systems/Mobility Strategies. Data obtained from the remedial investigations at the
Merchant site were applied to these domains. Despite the unfortunate history of looting, underdocumented avocational work, and lost artifact collections, the Merchant site retained significant
data potential and the excavations yielded substantial data to address each of the major research
domains.
The chronology of the site was refined by obtaining radiocarbon age estimates from a range of
features and contexts. This helped establish the process of site formation and occupation history
and also aided in identifying the cultural historical processes of group migration. Subsistence
was examined via a detailed study of faunal remains recovered during fieldwork. The study
established patterns of faunal exploitation, diet breadth, and hunting strategies. Plant resources
exploited by the inhabitants were identified in flotation and pollen samples. These studies
evaluated the relative contributions of hunting, gathering, and agriculture to the subsistence
economy of the Merchant site residents. Settlement and mobility were examined by a review of
ceramic wares and chipped stone material types, in addition to inferences regarding settlement
duration, connections and movement of the resident population, and logical patterns of hunting.

In addition to the remedial excavations within the LCAS village area, several survey, mapping,
and remote sensing studies were conducted to better define the nature of the LCAS excavation
area and the larger site of LA 43414. These investigations were designed to assist in the
interpretation of prehistoric settlement on Grama Ridge and to provide detailed imagery and GIS
data to help monitor and manage the site. A high-resolution Transect Recording Unit (TRU)
survey and mapping of artifact and feature distributions was completed, along with a detailed
EDM mapping and surface artifact collection, of the LCAS village area. A drone-assisted aerial
photographic survey of the site and surrounding terrain was completed, including high-resolution
contour mapping, examination of images using spectral processing, and other photogrammetric
methods. A ground-penetrating radar survey was conducted at the southern edge of the LCAS
area to search for buried structures and other features. The methods and results of these
investigations are reviewed in the following chapter.

Transect Recording Unit Survey
The Lea County Archaeological Society excavation area of LCAS E-4 is part of a larger
archaeological site designated as LA 43414. Archaeological surveys conducted since the time of
the LCAS excavations identified areas of artifacts and features for some distance to the north,
south, and east of the escarpment ridge. As reviewed in Chapter Three, the current definition of
LA 43414 is based on a 2001 survey by Lone Mountain Archaeological Consultants (LMAS) and
consists of six loci that are separated from each other by distances ranging from 60 to 400 meters.
The area of the LCAS excavations and original boundary of LA 43414 was designated as
Locus 2. Locus 3 is previously recorded site LA 65936, and Locus 6 is another previously
recorded site, LA 43416. Locus 1, Locus 4, and Locus 5 are feature and artifact scatters along the
ridge to the north and south of the LCAS area recorded during the 2001 LMAS survey and
incorporated within the new site boundary. No justification was provided in the LMAS report for
combining the previously recorded sites and newly identified loci into a single site.
The current site boundary listed on the 2009 and 2001 site forms completed by LMAS subsumes
the six loci and measures 875 m north/south by 625 m east/west for an area of 546,875 square
meters, although the actual site area is smaller due to the narrow width of the southern half of the
site.
The first of the tasks stipulated by the Scope of Work issued by the Carlsbad Field Office for the
investigations at LA 43414 involved an intensive survey and evaluation of whether or not the
47

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

sites and loci composing the site should remain as a single site. Prior to the beginning the
excavations in the LCAS village area, a high-resolution TRU survey of the entire site and its
surroundings was completed to document artifact and feature distributions and the spatial and
temporal relationships of the LCAS excavation area and other five loci.
The TRU method is an intensive and comprehensive 100 percent inventory of designated survey
parcels developed, implemented, and refined at Fort Bliss Military Reservation in southcentral
New Mexico and far western Texas (see Graves et al. 2002; Kludt et al. 2007; Lukowski and
Stuart 1996; O’Leary et al. 1997; for early examples of the development of the method). The
TRU method uses global positioning system (GPS) units to position and maintain the locational
accuracy of survey cells along transects. Transect lines in survey blocks are oriented along the
north-south axis of the parcel. The grid system is positioned so that the southwest corner of the
transect grid is placed on the southwest corner of a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinate. A transect recording unit cell (TRU) typically measures 15 m by 15 m in size, but the
system can be modified to meet the standards of different agencies or projects. Each TRU (or
cell) along a contiguous transect line is examined by a crew member assigned to that transect.
The survey grid and transects are recorded as UTM coordinates. Each crew member is equipped
with a hand-held personal digital assistant (PDA) unit and GPS unit to document cultural and
natural observations within the TRU cell. The field supervisor is equipped with a high resolution
and high-accuracy Trimble™ GEO-XT handheld GPS unit to ensure that crew members maintain
consistency and accuracy in transect coverage and field documentation.
Features and architectural remains are measured and all artifacts within each TRU cell are tallied
by class. Features are assigned a number and the locality is plotted with a GPS unit for exact
provenience. In addition to prehistoric attributes, assessments of the immediate environment,
including geomorphic setting, surface exposure, vegetation, and modern impacts are made.
Obstacles that can obscure the discovery of cultural resources, such as dense vegetation or recent
alluvium, are also noted. The information on cultural materials and features and natural attributes
are recorded and saved into the PDA.
An important aspect of the method is that sites are not defined in the field but instead are defined
in the laboratory by processing the spatial data through GIS subroutines. Sites are defined
through specific density and distance criteria. The raw TRU cell data is processed through a
series of Boolean statements and site-positive TRU units (cells that met criteria for artifact
counts) are established. Sites are defined on a uniform distance criterion based on a set buffer
between positive cells. Once sites are defined, the boundaries and other TRU information are
converted to GIS shapefiles for further analysis and evaluation. The combination of standardized
field recording methods and GIS site definition serve to reduce considerably the subjective and
ambiguous nature of site boundary definition. Site boundaries are defined on the basis of
standardized distance criterion (e.g., 10, 15, or 20 m as determined by various agency and
archaeological requirements) between TRU cells that have been fully documented for artifact and
feature content. The effects of idiosyncratic and biased site definitions are considerably reduced
and, in some cases, eliminated by the use of GIS-based site definitions based on standard
distances between positive TRU cells.
The Merchant site TRU grid was positioned so that the southwest corner of the grid was placed
on the southwest corner of a one-meter UTM coordinate. Each TRU cell was 10-x-10-m in size
and was input as the exact UTM coordinate for the SW corner. The 10-m transect data from the
individual PDA units were downloaded into the Versar GIS system. Using the GIS programs and
routines, the site boundaries of the individual loci and the overall site boundary for LA 43414
were generated on the 20-meter distance criterion for site definition as specified in Chapter 1
Section A.6.b.2 of BLM Manual H-8100-1. Boundary information was converted to ArcView™

Results of TRU Survey at LA 43414
The TRU survey of LA 43414 was completed during two days of November of 2014 and the
results are illustrated in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2. The area within the boundaries defined by
LMAS in 2001 was examined as well as a 100-m buffer beyond those boundaries. A total of
5,282 10-m by 10-m TRU cells (528,200 square meters or 144 acres) were examined and
documented. Of the 5,282 TRU cells, 459 were positive for surface artifacts or features. Using
the 20-m distance criterion, the GIS site routine defined a boundary measuring approximately
938 m northwest/ southeast by 461 m northeast/southwest and subsuming 2,386 TRU cells
(Figure 4.1). Note that 27 positive cells were located more than 20 m from the nearest sitepositive cell and therefore plot outside the TRU-defined boundary and are considered isolated
artifacts.
Within the 459 positive TRU units, a count of 4,075 surface artifacts was recorded (Table 4.1).
The most common artifact classes accounting for nearly 82 percent of the total were fire-cracked
rock/caliche and animal bone, most of which was recorded in the LCAS village area (LMAS
Locus 2). Additional scatters of fire-cracked rock/caliche were observed in LMAS Locus 6
where site LA 43416 had been recorded.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Comparing the TRU site boundary with previous definitions, it is apparent that the 2001 LMAS
site boundary and the revised boundary are generally equivalent (see Figure 4.1). The minor
differences are due to the 20-m boundary criterion used to define the TRU site boundary. The
only major differences are found at the northern boundary where the TRU boundary is 100 m to
the south of the previous boundary and at the southern edge of the site where the TRU boundary
extends about 80 m to the west of the 2001 boundary. The northern TRU boundary excludes a
few positive artifact cells that do not fall within the 20-m distance criterion, and the southern
TRU boundary includes a few artifacts and boulder cupule locations found below the edge of the
escarpment.
The next analysis was to determine if the three sites and three loci identified during previous
surveys and combined into a single site should continue to be combined based on the TRU
distance criterion of 20 m. Figure 4.2 shows the relationship of the six loci to the TRU survey
cells and site boundary. With the exception of portions of Locus 3 and Locus 6, the previously
recorded loci can be incorporated within the overall site definition and boundary of LA 43414.
However, it is also evident that the distributions of both artifact-positive and feature-positive
TRU cells extend far beyond and between the loci, and accordingly, there is little or no
justification for maintaining the loci as separate and distinct areas of prehistoric occupation.
Surface features were mapped across the site, but it is clear that the greatest concentration of
features is found within Locus 2, the area of the LCAS excavations. The majority of the features
on the mesa outside of Locus 2 consisted of fire-cracked rock hearths and a few structural
features, while many of the features distributed along the slope and base of the escarpment were
bedrock mortars and cupules.
Beyond the issue of TRU boundary definitions, an important component of the investigation was
to examine the relationship of the possible structural features reported in Locus 3, 4, and 5 in
relation to the LCAS settlement area of Locus 2. Additional surface structures were reported for
Locus 3 and Locus 5 and two pithouse depressions were noted in Locus 3 (Allison et al. 2009;
Gregory 2001; Seymour 2001). The TRU survey and mapping efforts were intended to help
evaluate whether the structures in other loci were non-contemporaneous occupations or were part
of a larger community settlement along the ridge top. One area of particular interest was
identified between and to the east of Locus 4 and Locus 5 (see Figure 4.2). No evidence was
found of a pueblo roomblock near the eastern margin of Locus 5 described by the 2001 and 2009
surveys. Instead, scatters and pavements of caliche cobbles and several linear alignments of
cobbles were broadly distributed throughout a 170 m by 100 m area along the shallow drainage
passing through the northern third of the site. The TRU survey established the spatial and
locational foundations for the subsequent remote sensing and mapping efforts.

Aerial Photography and Photogrammetry
Prior to commencing with the hand excavations, Versar and Archaeo-Geophysical Associates
(AGA) conducted an intensive, low-altitude, high-resolution aerial photography and threedimensional contour mapping of the entire 86-acre boundary of LA 43414. A vertical contour
resolution of 2 cm was mapped for the LCAS village area (LMAS Locus 2) and a resolution of 5
to 10 cm for the remainder of the site. This high degree of resolution is possible through recent
advances in aerial photography and photogrammetry that allow for the collection and processing
of extremely high resolution low altitude aerial imagery. Using aerial platforms such as blimps,
kites, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or “drones”) a number of transects can be flown
across an archaeological site or landscape while a series of overlapping digital photos are
collected.
While the individual high-resolution photographs are useful for archaeological research, the
added power of these techniques lies in the ability to extract both 3D and orthographic data from
52

Chapter Four
Surface and Remote Sensing Investigations at LA 43414

the imagery. Millimeter-precision contour mapping is possible along with the ability to create
real-time aerial imagery that is fully georeferenced, undistorted, and available as custom layers
for use in GIS programs. Similar data quality is impossible with traditional Total Data Station
(TDS), transit, or theodolite mapping; and furthermore, the aerial photogrammetry can be
accomplished in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks.
The entirety of LA 43414 was aerially mapped before the remedial excavations were begun. The
first period of mapping took place in conjunction with the TRU survey (see below), allowing the
aerial and ground surveys to be coordinated and key locational points such as datum markers,
roomblocks, and open excavation units to be linked via GPS and GIS programs. A second field
session was completed to correct and improve some of the imagery from the first session that
suffered from unfavorable lighting conditions. A third session mapped the LCAS village area
during the first Versar excavations of the backdirt mounds around Pit Structure 1, and a fourth set
of images was obtained after Versar had completed the remedial excavation of the two LCAS pit
structures and several midden areas.
Equipment and Methods
The survey was completed during the months of November 2014 and January, April, and
November of 2015. Four surveys were completed: the first two mapping the entire area of LA
43414 and the latter two focusing on the LCAS excavation area and locations of remedial
excavations conducted in 2015. A combined area of 11 square kilometers was aerially surveyed
during the four sessions.
AGA used a Swinglet CAM, ready-to-deploy light-weight mini UAV, weighing 500g, with a
wing span of 80cm. This unit has an on-board system comprising a Sony DSC-WX220 18.2megapixel digital camera, a GPS, and a radio receiver, which is controlled by a ground-based
computer (semi-rugged laptop) via a 2.4GHz radio modem for data transfer. In addition to the
Swinglet Cam, aerial mapping was augmented with a 3DRobitics X8+ multirotor helicopter. The
X8+ is also a safe and lightweight machine that carries a Ricoh GR camera. The X8+, which is
made of carbon fiber and plastic, measures 60cm in diameter and weighs 2500 grams. The X8+
is best suited for short range, very low altitude missions. Ground control was established using a
sub-centimeter resolution Sokkia Radian IS RTK GPS system.
The UAVs, all peripherals, and the ground-based computer are stored in a single carrying case.
Flyovers of archaeological sites included multiple, overlapping passes at different elevations not
exceeding the altitude ceiling set by the FAA and the Academy of Model Aeronautics for
recreational remote control aircraft. For high-resolution mapping, the goal is to generate a very
dense digital terrain model (DTM) and to provide stereo-images for highly detailed architectural
mapping and mound volume measurements.
The first stage of data acquisition is accomplished through a digital process called
photogrammetry. Photogrammetry extracts 3D data from a series of overlapping stereo-pair
images, very much like a pair of human eyes. One image is photographed from a "right-eye"
perspective and another from the "left-eye" with approximately 70 percent overlap between the
two. Computer software compares the overlapping area from the photographs and then recreates
the topography of the region. Traditional photogrammetry requires fairly rigid control over the
way photographs are taken. The spatial relationship between the photographs also must be
known. In order to achieve this, the camera-mounted UAV is programed with a flight pattern that
uses a fore-and-aft overlap of 70 percent to minimize the influence of wind and to guarantee 100
percent stereo overlap for the area of interest. Spatial controls are established by five control
points marked with aerial photo targets placed across the site prior to flight.

53

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

After the flyovers are completed, ground control points (GCPs) were recorded using a X90 OPUS
static GPS receiver. The GCPs serve to geo-rectify the digital images, establishing the precise
location of the imagery to within +/- 10 centimeters under most conditions. The output includes a
series of digital photographs that are processed using commercial photo-merging software. The
software merges individual photographs by common points relative to the location of the camera.
The software then uses the estimated camera positions with the tiled images to derive a 3D
polygonal mesh of the ground surface. It ortho-rectifies the image series to establish a uniform
scale, remove any distortion, and produce digital orthophotos and DTMs that can be used in any
GIS (Global Information System) or 3D mapping software. A total of 3,604 photos were taken;
however, not all were used in the orthophoto or DTM production. Data was processed at the
AGA GIS Laboratory.
Examples of High Resolution and Photogrammetric Images
Flyovers were conducted at several points, including the beginning of fieldwork, during the
excavations of the LCAS village area, and after the excavations were completed and before the
two large pit structures were backfilled with sterile caliche. The enhanced aerial data provide
several useful ways to examine LA 43414 and its landscape setting. The photographic and
photogrammetric data reveals subtle variations in ground surfaces and vegetation. Furthermore,
the datasets can be incorporated directly into GIS layers, allowing for the information collected
from the TRU survey and TDS mapping to be layered with the aerial imagery and contour maps.
An example of this potential is provided by Figure 4.3, which shows the high-resolution aerial
image of the entire site. The TRU defined site boundary, linked to GPS UTM coordinates, has
been plotted over the aerial image. Modern roads are visible in the image and natural features
such as drainages and soil and vegetation changes can be examined. The exposures of white
caliche conglomerate along the edge of the escarpment are visible, as are the underlying
Permian/Triassic red clay beds.
Examples of photogrammetry and contour mapping are illustrated in Figure 4.4, including
variations of conventional topographic contour maps, digital elevation models (DEM), and
combinations of the two. The contours are of sufficient resolution and sensitivity that the two
open LCAS excavation units from the 1960s can be seen as small depressions on the DEM
images and as contours on the topographic maps. The prominent drainage beginning in the center
of the site and trending towards the southeast is noteworthy for the fact that the series of possible
agricultural features identified during TRU survey follow the contours of the drainage.
The high-resolution aerial images proved invaluable for detailed examination of the habitation
structures, possible agricultural features, and surrounding landscape of the Merchant site (Figure
4.5). The resolution of the images allows for wide-scale views of the LCAS village area showing
the open excavations of the two pit structures (Figure 4.5, upper panel) and allows for close-up
views of the domestic rooms that are of such resolution and quality that individual rocks of
foundation walls can be identified (Figure 4.5, lower panel). Several versions of aerial imagery
are used throughout the report to identify and study domestic rooms and roomblocks, the two
LCAS pit structures, and the nature of the possible agricultural features.

Transect Recording Site Mapping
The distributions of artifacts and surface features were mapped during the TRU survey, and
features were classified according to their surface attributes and morphology. A total of 121
features was plotted, classified, and documented (Table 4.2). One modern feature, a USGS ¼
section marker, was recorded beyond the northern boundary of the site. Individual features are
listed in Table 4.3. Feature 122 was a buried structure identified during the GPR survey.
The spatial distribution of the primary feature classes is illustrated in Figure 4.6. The larger
definition of LA 43414 includes a wide variety of feature types distributed across most of the site
and establishes that LA 43414 had a long and complex occupational history. Aside from the
cluster of surface rooms in the LCAS village area, a newly defined cluster of rooms was
identified 100 m to the south. Isolated surface rooms were mapped in Loci 4 and 5 in the general
locations where surface rooms had been observed during the previous LMAS surveys. Several
pithouse stains were mapped along the margins of the escarpment, burned rock features were
present across most of the site, and several bedrock features were plotted along and below the
escarpment. One of the more intriguing series of features are the possible agricultural grids and
check dams distributed along the drainage crossing the north-central part of the site. The primary
feature classes are reviewed in greater detail below.

Structures
The most common class of surface feature identified during TRU survey and mapping was
domestic structures. Domestic structures included 44 possible surface rooms similar to those
excavated by the LCAS (see Chapter Five) and 6 pithouses. Most of the surface rooms were in
the LCAS village area (the Merchant site proper). Additional rooms were identified in the
general locations within Locus 3 and Locus 5 where LMAS had found structures during the 1991
seismic line surveys. A possible room block was also identified 65 m south of the southern
portion of the original Merchant site and included a possible roomblock of four rooms with a fifth
room to the southeast. The rooms were outlined by 50 to 100 cobbles and measured from 4 m to
6 m in length. Few artifacts and no midden deposits were found around this location, and the
identification of the surface cobbles as rooms is uncertain.
Six pithouses or pit structures were visible on the site surface. Two of the structures are the large,
deep pit structures excavated by Leslie and the LCAS in the early 1960s. The excavation units
for these structures have remained open for the past 50 years and are clearly visible on the site
surface and in aerial views (see Figure 4.5).
The other four structures are smaller domestic pithouses. Two were found in Locus 4 and were
slight depressions with dark fills measuring 3 m in diameter. The other two pithouses include
Feature 80 in the northwest portion of the site and Feature 79 that is a pithouse between Locus 3
and Locus 5 that was identified by LMAS.
Refuse and Midden Areas
Refuse areas include prehistoric midden deposits and deposits of screened backdirt left by the
LCAS excavators and looters. It was often difficult to differentiate between the two types of
deposits because the LCAS members and looters usually screened feature fills over existing
midden areas, leaving churned and mixed deposits of both screened and unscreened fill. Most
refuse areas are not plotted on Figure 4.6. They are horizontally extensive features, several of
which measure from 100 to 300 square meters. The locations and nature of the refuse areas are
reviewed in greater detail in Chapter Five.
Refuse areas surrounded the open excavation units of Pit Structures 1 and 2, comprised several
mounded deposits to the north of the roomblocks, and included several small mounds of backdirt
adjacent to rooms and other features. Refuse Area A, Leslie’s designation of the midden areas
and backdirt mounds north of the roomblock, consisted of several mounds up to a meter in height.
The screened backdirt deposits were quite distinct, consisting of surface deposits covered by
caliche cobbles and gravels emptied from screens and having variable densities of artifacts and
animal bone.
Two small surface midden deposits were mapped, one of which (Feature 39) was found to be part
of the buried pithouse identified in Unit 84-1 by John Speth. The second feature (Feature 42)
appears to be associated with a small domestic habitation area.
Possible Agricultural Features
Possible agricultural grid gardens or terraces (n=9) and check dams (n=5) were documented
across the northwest and northcentral areas of LA 43414. The features are extensive patterned
distributions of caliche cobbles oriented from the northwest towards the southeast along the
margins of the main drainage channel traversing the site (Figure 4.7). Feature 91 was originally
identified as a small, four-room pueblo roomblock (Feature L5) in Locus 5 (Seymour 2001:173).
The gridded pattern of the possible fields and border walls do resemble collapsed and disturbed
foundation walls, and it is easy to see how they could be confused with pueblo rooms. However,

63

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

no midden deposits or dense artifact scatters typical of pueblo settlements were observed in or
around this location.

Figure 4.7. Locations of possible agricultural features. Feature 93 is a cluster of three cairns.

64

Chapter Four
Surface and Remote Sensing Investigations at LA 43414

The possible check dams or border walls consisted of two to five linear alignments of caliche
positioned across drainages and spaced 4 to 6 m apart (Figure 4.8). The exposed portions
measured around one or two meters in length, were 50 cm wide, and consisted of 20 or more
caliche cobbles. The ends of the features beyond the drainage channels were buried by eolian
sands; thus the actual length of the features could not be determined.
Two of the possible agricultural features (Feature 95 and Feature 108) were examined through
backhoe trenches and hand excavations. The results of these investigations are presented in
Chapter Seven.
Burned Rock Features
Burned rock features, including hearths and baking pits with burned caliche and burned limestone
cookstones, were distributed throughout most areas of the site. Twenty-two features were plotted,
three of which had evidence of intact organic deposits on the surface. Most of the features were
concentrated in the northwest and southern areas, and many were isolated from other features and
artifact distributions. Two of the burned rock features were classified as burned rock middens
(plant baking pits) and one example (Feature 52) was excavated during the 2015 fieldwork.
Cairns
A cluster of three possible cairn features were identified a few meters to the north of the possible
agricultural Feature 91 (see Figure 4.7). Each cairn is a mound of approximately 300 caliche
cobbles measuring 30 cm in height (Figure 4.9). The cobbles were clearly size-selected, and
therefore the features are considered to be cultural in origin. Similar features in the western
Jornada and Big Bend regions are often associated with human burials or caches (Mallouf 1987;
Miller 1990; Miller et al. 2012:116;). Whether the features at LA 43414 cover burials or caches
is unknown.
Bedrock Features
The final component of the prehistoric landscape of LA 43414 and the Merchant site was several
types of bedrock features. Leslie’s 1965 article and unpublished manuscript describe several
locations of bedrock mortars, bedrock metates or grinding slicks, and cupules (Figure 4.10). Two
groups were mapped to the north of the LCAS village area, and several other mortars were
mapped along the base of the escarpment (see Leslie’s site maps in Chapter Three). The two
northern clusters (termed Group 1 and Group 2 mortars) were not found during the TRU survey.
Photographs show that LCAS members had exposed the features by removing 30 or 40 cm of
soil, and apparently the features were reburied by the LCAS or natural infilling and are no longer
visible on the surface.
Other features identified during the 2015 TRU survey include cupules (n=16), mortars or bedrock
metates (n=11), and three sandstone boulders with possible rock art. All were situated in two
clusters in the southwest portion of the site below the escarpment. Large sandstone boulders
fallen from the stratum in the escarpment served as the foundation for the bedrock features. The
cupules measured 4 to 10 cm diameter and ranged from 2 to 6 cm deep. Mortars were 10 cm
diameter to one very large one at 41 cm by 49 cm diameter and ranged from few cm deep due to
them being infilled with sediment to as deep 35 cm associated with the largest mortar (Figure
4.11). Two bedrock metates were plotted below the escarpment. The most prominent rock art
feature was a line of 16 small circular cupules along the upper face of a sandstone boulder (Figure
4.11, lower right). The cupules measured 1 cm to 1.5 cm in diameter and were 1 cm deep. The
other two possible rock art features are suspect; one consists of a very faint spiral and the other is
some faint pecking on a boulder surface.

Surface Artifact Collections
Surface collections were conducted in the LCAS village area. The original plan was to collect all
surface artifacts from a 1,700-square meter area of domestic rooms, pit structures, and refuse
areas, including the backdirt mounds surrounding Pit Structures 1 and 2. The plan had to be
modified upon discovering that thousands of artifacts were present in the area.
The backdirt mound around and within Pit Structure 1 was collected. A 2-m by 2-m grid was
established over the open excavation unit and surrounding backdirt mounds and was tied to
Speth’s 1984 site datum using the EDM. The surface collection recovered 1,761 items (Table
4.4) from 48 units out of 53 collection units. Five units inside the structure lacked artifacts. The
average density was 8.3 artifacts per square meter. The highest densities were recorded on the
backdirt mounds; in some cases over 90 artifacts were collected within a single unit.
Almost 75 percent of the artifacts were animal bone, followed by ceramics, chipped stone, and
groundstone. Only seven projectile points were found. The difference in counts and proportions
among animal bone and projectile points immediately confirmed that the backdirt deposits
throughout the Merchant site had been selectively collected for the latter artifact type by the
LCAS investigators and looters. Ochoa Indented was the most common ceramic ware, and a
surprising number of groundstone tools and fragments were recovered.
The high artifact counts recovered from a 212-square meter area within the larger 1,700-square
meter village area indicated that further collections could amass over 13,000 artifacts. Moreover,
it was concluded that the planned excavation of the backdirt mounds and fill of the two pit
structures would recover suitable samples of all artifact classes and types. Accordingly, the
collection strategy was modified to focus on chronologically and functionally diagnostic artifacts.
A total of 349 artifacts were point-provenienced. As observed during the collection of Pit
Structure 1, animal bone was the most common item (30 percent of the plots), followed by
debitage (26 percent) and Ochoa Indented sherds (23 percent). Only five additional projectile
points were recovered from the surface of the LCAS excavation area. Most of the items were
found between the two pit structures and roomblocks.
One additional special collection was completed. The LCAS excavation of Pit Structure 1
encountered a 30-cm-thick mass of animal bone designated as Zone E. Leslie notes that the mass
of bone removed from Zone E was dumped off the edge of the escarpment to the west of the
structure. The escarpment slope was included within the boundaries of the TRU survey fieldwork
and the location of the bone dump was identified (see Chapter Five). Bones were plotted for a
distance of almost 25 meters, indicating that the large masses of bones from Zone E were
discarded during several trips and at several locations along the terrace. A total of 431 large and
medium mammal bone fragments were identified and collected for analysis.

Ground Penetrating Radar Survey
A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey was conducted at the Merchant site to supplement the
landscape remote sensing survey and archaeological excavations. GPR data collection was
conducted in areas chosen (and cleared of vegetation) by Versar archaeologists (Figure 4.12).
Collection area was chosen based on the high probability of buried structural features. The GPR
survey successfully recorded the presence of two possible buried structures and four possible
archaeological features.

Ground Penetrating Radar in Archaeology
GPR is an active, non-invasive technique that uses a shielded surface antenna to transmit pulses
of radar energy, generally high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) waves, that reflect off buried
objects, features, or geological bedding contacts and are detected using a receiving antenna
(Conyers 2004:23-28). The waves detected by the receiving antenna are recorded in nanoseconds
(ns) that reflect the two-way travel time of the radar energy. Fairly accurate approximations of
depth of recorded anomalies can be determined through velocity analysis (Conyers and Lucius
1996).
While GPR is one of the more widely used techniques in archaeogeophysics, its success, like that
of the other archaeogeophysics techniques, is largely based on such site conditions as soil type,
sediment mineralogy, and moisture content (Conyers 2004; Kvamme 2003). For example, ideal
soil types for GPR include dry homogenous soils with minimal clay. On the other extreme, radar
energy will become attenuated more quickly in more conductive mediums such as clay and
poorly drained soils or in mediums with high magnetic permeability (Conyers 2004).
Geophysical survey investigations have become an important part of the pursuit of North
American archaeology and employ a range of techniques for the non-destructive prospecting of
archaeological deposits (Gaffney and Gater 2003; Kvamme 2008). Several techniques have been
derived from geophysical prospecting and adopted for archaeological investigations through
rigorous field collection techniques and unique data processing programs specifically developed
for the study of the archaeogeophysical record (Kvamme 2003). Techniques used mostly for
archaeological research include soil resistivity, soil conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,
magnetometry, and ground-penetrating radar (Kvamme 2003). All produce different results and
require different equipment. Magnetometers record the net sum of all magnetic fields, both
induced and remnant, and GPR records relative dielectric permittivity.
The geophysical instruments are differentially affected by variables such as moisture, metal trash
or debris, and the transmission of signals such as cell phones and transmission lines. Data
collection is also impacted differently for each of the geophysical instruments by physical
impediments such as trees, pavement, fences, and vegetation. The different geophysical
techniques that have been used in archaeology have been discussed in a number of seminal books
and journal articles (Clark 1990; Conyers 2004; Gaffney 2008; Gaffney and Gater 2003; Scollar
et al. 1990; Weymouth 1986; Witten 2006).
Field methods for archaeogeophysical investigations vary in detail from technique to technique,
but there are several factors that are consistent with all techniques. The density of the dataset is
controlled by two factors: (1) traverse interval—the distance between the passes the instrument
makes as it is passed back and forth across the collection area; and (2) sample interval—the
distance between readings the instrument records as it passes along each traverse. Readings are
either collected in a known cycle (i.e., 5 readings per second) and the surveyor matches their sets
to their gait to establish the desired sample density (this is the case with the gradiometer), or a
calibrated survey wheel is used to record readings at set intervals (as is the case with the GPR).
While an important and useful means of data acquisition, geophysical prospecting is most
effective when combined with detailed understanding of the site-specific characteristics of
archaeological deposits. This has been demonstrated by numerous case studies (e.g.,Weymouth
1986). A growing body of literature addresses the use of geophysical prospecting as a primary
means of data collection when coupled with other data from previous and/or current excavations
and has been described by Kvamme (2003) as the future of archaeological geophysics. Each
method used in this project is described briefly below.

Field Methods and Data Processing
The GPR data was collected in square collection grids. Non-magnetic markers on two opposite
sides of the collection grid were used to guide the surveyor’s path back and forth across the
collection area. GPR data was collected with a 0.25 m traverse interval and at 64 readings/m.
All data were processed and filtered to remove extraneous false readings (spikes and drop-outs).
Data processing levels the datasets so that adjacent grids are combined into a single image with
no “grid lines.” Datasets were processed to enhance the visibility of the target features and
geophysical anomalies through statistical manipulation of the recorded data as well as through
image processing of the image file output.
The general goal of data processing is to lessen the effects of background “noise” and to enhance
the quality of the “signal” or “target.” In field geophysics in general, and archaeogeophysics in
particular, the term noise is used to discuss any return that is not a result of the object under
investigation—the latter being referred to as the “target” or “signal.” Hence, in some cases what
is discussed as noise can in another case become the signal or target (Milsom 2005:13-14).
Accuracy of the geophysical readings are not as important for resolving targets as is the contrast
between the target and its surrounding matrix.
The major data processing techniques are discussed in this section (see also the ArchaeoSurveyor
or GPR Slice user manuals), along with details on the specific data processing workflow applied
to each collection grid. Kvamme (2006:236) is followed in the general approach to data
processing. After each processing step, the results are closely compared to their previous state to
assure that data manipulation is not, in fact, decreasing the clarity and quality of the data and thus
ensures that the findings are not products of data processing.
GPR data was processed using GPR Slice. The initial data processing for the project involved the
generation of amplitude slice-maps (Conyers 2004). Amplitude slice-maps are a threedimensional tool for viewing differences in reflected amplitudes across a given surface at various
depths. Reflected radar amplitudes are of interest because they measure the degree of physical
and chemical differences in buried materials. Strong, or high amplitude, reflections often indicate
denser or different buried materials, such as archaeological features. Amplitude slice-maps are
generated through the comparison of reflected amplitudes between the reflections recorded in
vertical profiles. In this method, amplitude variations, recorded as digital values, are analyzed at
each location in a grid of many profiles where there is a reflection recorded. The amplitudes of
all traces are compared to the amplitudes of all nearby traces along each profile. This database
can then be “sliced” horizontally and displayed to show the variation in reflection amplitudes at a
sequence of depths in the ground. The result is a map that shows amplitudes in map view, but
also with depth. Often when this is done, changes in the soil related to disturbances such as trash
pits or dense clusters of rocks can become visible, making many features visible to the human eye
that may not be visible in individual profiles.
The data was also processed as GPR profiles or “radiograms.” The radiograms are the plots of
the raw data files presented as 2D vertical profiles. Radiograms were processed using a
background removal filter that removes the linear banding that is often visible in GPR profiles.
These radiograms were merged with the GPS coordinates, allowing for precise locations to be
generated for any anomaly located within the collection areas.
Survey Results
GPR data was collected in areas chosen and cleared of vegetation by Versar archaeologists (see
Figure 4.12). Collection area was chosen based on the high probability of buried structural
features. The GPR survey successfully recorded the presence of two possible buried structures

and four possible archaeological features (Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14). Table 4.5. lists the

The individual GPR amplitude time slices (Figure 4.15 through Figure 4.18) show varying
degrees of patterning consistent with possible archaeological structures. Slices 2–4 (Figures
4.15–4.16) have high amplitude reflections that throughout the signal depth have a general
rectilinear pattern. These areas are interpreted here as possible structures (see Table 4.5 for UTM
coordinates). Several areas surrounding these two possible structures are also of interest;
however, they do not conform to any easily definable cultural pattern. These anomalies are
interpreted as possible archaeological features. They are consistent with trash pits or possibly
thermally altered features.
The location of Structure 2 is the same as Room 7 identified by Leslie and Speth. The 2014
mapping effort noted the presence of foundation walls along the northern and eastern sides of the
room. Leslie and the LCAS excavated only the uppermost roof fall, leaving the remainder of the
fill and floor intact, and surprisingly this room escaped the attention of looters and is mostly
intact.
The GPR survey confirmed that the known locations of unexcavated rooms (Room 7; GPR
Structure 1) can be detected, and previously unknown buried rooms (newly designated Room M;
GPR Structure 2) can be detected as well. Future excavations at the Merchant site would benefit
from a comprehensive GPR survey prior to initiating excavations.

Spatial and Distributional Analysis
Using the GIS routines and TRU survey data, TRU cell count and kernel density maps were
created for lithic, ceramics, groundstone, burned rock, and animal bones (Figure 4.19 through
Figure 4.27). Cell count maps simply show the counts of certain artifact types within the TRU
cells. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric technique to measure artifact density
by placing a two-dimensional probability density function (the ‘kernel’) across observed data
points to create an approximation of the overall artifact distributions and densities. The density
value for each grid cell is then established by adding together values of density distributions that
overlie the grid cell (Conolly and Lake 2006: 175). The purpose of using a KDE is to smooth the
data in such a way that visual displays of artifact populations can be made based on finite samples
allowing for the locations of clustered and random distributions to be identified across a grid or
site. Higher KDE values indicate non-random clustering of artifacts while lower values represent
random distributions.
Most of the plots display similar patterns, showing the LCAS village area having much higher
artifact densities than surrounding areas within LA 43414 and clearly establish that the pueblo
roomblocks and pit structures were the most dominant settlement location of this part of Grama
Ridge. Yet several less prominent but equally significant patterns provide insights into the nature
of settlement across the prehistoric landscape of LA 43414.
The plot of TRU cell counts for lithic artifacts is displayed in Figure 4.19, and a kernel density
map derived from those data is shown in Figure 4.20. Lithic artifacts are widely distributed
across the site, with the interesting exception that most of the TRU cells with possible agricultural
features have few or no lithic items. The greatest densities by far are centered on the LCAS
village area, a pattern that is repeated among each of the following artifact class plots. A few
minor dense areas are evident, most of which correspond to locations of habitation structures
identified through TRU mapping as well as during earlier seismic line surveys. A small area in
the northeast corner of the site is of interest because very few features aside from some isolated
hearths were recorded in this area.
The plots and kernel density maps for ceramics (Figure 4.21 and Figure 4.22) display a more
restricted distribution than the lithic items. Almost all TRU cells are concentrated within the
LCAS area. A few isolated sherds or sherd scatters are present at the northwest and northeast
areas of the site where some isolated habitation structure were mapped. Interestingly, no TRU
cells with ceramics are present to the south of the LCAS area. The isolated cluster to the west of
the LCAS village is small pot break scattered along the slope of the escarpment.
The distribution and densities plots of groundstone artifacts (Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24) are one
of the more surprising findings from the TRU mapping and GIS analysis. As with the abovementioned distributions, the highest density of groundstone tools and fragments is centered on the
LCAS village. However, positive TRU cells for groundstone items are present across almost the
entire northern two-thirds of the site, and many TRU cells contain multiple groundstone artifacts.
Also noteworthy is that, as noted for lithics and ceramics, most of the TRU cells where
agricultural features were plotted lack groundstone items. As seen in the ceramic plots,
groundstone tools are mostly absent to the south of the LCAS village. The absence of
groundstone and ceramics in the southern one-third of the site may indicate that the isolated
hearths in this area represent a different adaption or temporal component, a premise at least
partially supported by the Protohistoric or early Historic radiocarbon date obtained from hearth
Feature 64 in this area (see Chapter Eight).

The TRU and kernel density plots for burned rock, including burned limestone and caliche, are
illustrated in Figure 4.25 and Figure 4.26. Burned rock is widely distributed across the site, and,
unsurprisingly, the distributions mirror the locations of burned rock features. The greatest
densities are in the LCAS village area and a few isolated locations in the vicinity of habitation
structures to the northwest. As with other artifact classes, very few TRU cells with burned rock
were recorded in the areas of TRU cells where agricultural features had been plotted. Several
burned rock TRU cells are present in the southern one-third of the site, and again match the plots
of several burned rock hearths and a burned rock midden feature. The absence or scarcity of
other artifact classes in association with these features is of interest.
Finally the plot of bone artifacts is displayed (see Figure 4.27). There is no need to display a
kernel density map because the only TRU cells with surface animal bone were recorded within
the LCAS village. The positive TRU cells for animal bone were centered on the domestic rooms,
backdirt mounds surrounding pit structures, refuse areas, and generally the locations where
surface collections recovered high quantities of bone.
The GIS spatial mapping of LA 43414 and the Merchant site proper (LCAS village area) revealed
several important aspects of the larger prehistoric landscape. A wide range of features, artifact
patterns, and occupation areas are reflected in the distributions, and some provide additional
evidence for preliminary interpretations of certain features or areas. Perhaps the most noteworthy
finding is the relative absence of surface lithic, ceramic, and groundstone artifacts in TRU cells
among the suspected agricultural features. It should be noted that subsequent excavations in
these features found that all three artifact classes are present in subsurface contexts.
Nevertheless, when viewed in terms relative to the rest of the site, the surface densities are
probably related to subsurface densities, and thus the areas of possible agricultural features may
indeed have much lower artifact counts compared to habitation areas of the site.
The LCAS village area has by far the greatest densities of all artifact classes, including animal
bone. A few areas with moderate densities relate to the locations of habitation structures. The
widespread distribution of numerous groundstone artifacts was, at first, particularly surprising.
Viewing these distributions in light of the findings of subsistence studies presented later in this
report, it is apparent that many or most of the occupations at the Merchant site (the LCAS village
area) and the larger area of LA 43414 were agricultural in nature. The clear exception is the
southern one-third of the site that appears to consist of isolated, short-term occupations, most of
which may were probably unrelated to the northern settlement areas.

Mapping the LCAS Excavation Area
The final pre-excavation task involved the careful inspection of the 1,700 square meter LCAS
village area (the Merchant site proper) and mapping the features using an electronic distance
measurement (EDM) total station. This would be the most recent of a series of site maps
beginning in 1965 (Leslie 1965a), continuing through the early 1980s (Leslie n.d.; Speth 1984),
with the most recent maps produced during the surveys of the early 1990s (Gregory 2001;
Seymour 2001).
Speth’s 1984 rebar datum was found intact. It was buttressed with two additional rebar, and a
rebar backsite datum was established 20 m true south across the dirt road. Both datum points
were geo-referenced and tied to the UTM coordinates of the TRU survey, the aerial drone
surveys, the surface collection grid, and the GPR survey parcel. All subsequent mapping and
excavation tasks were referenced to the Speth 1984 datum. Architectural features such as
foundation wall segments, open LCAS excavation units, refuse areas, hearths, and other features
were mapped. The backdirt piles from the LCAS investigations were also mapped. The EDM
was used to maintain vertical levels and provenience during the excavation of the deep backdirt
deposits in the two pit structures.
The task proved more difficult than anticipated. Locating and mapping the surface rooms
excavated or mapped by Robert Leslie proved to be a difficult and often frustrating endeavor.
The locations and plots of Pit Structures 1 and 2 were not a problem since the large pits of the
LCAS excavations remained open. The location of Room 7 was also easily identified on the
surface. A common wall segment of Rooms 9 and 10 was visible on the surface, as were wall
segments of some of the isolated rooms, including a well-preserved set of four walls located
around 15 meters to the north of the Pit Structure 1 excavation
While some rooms could be identified, problems arose while attempting to link Leslie’s map and
other maps of the domestic rooms to our surface observations. It was determined that the plot of
Room 6 by Leslie and other surveyors was an error that apparently led to a series of compounded
errors. Leslie mapped Room 6 as isolated from the northern roomblock and the location of this
room has often been one of the keys or anchor points that researchers have used to orient Leslie’s
map and identify nearby rooms.
However, these identifications are open to question. Our review of the surface feature previously
identified as Room 6 does not match the room and its foundation walls described and illustrated
by Leslie (Figure 4.28; see also Chapter Five). As described by Leslie, only a portion of the
eastern wall and southeast corner of Room 6 remained intact; the western wall was completely
absent and the northern and southern walls were reconstructed by laying out lines of loose
cobbles Figure 4.28, left side panel). In contrast, the present-day surface room that has been
identified as Room 6 has long, intact segments of at least three substantial walls (Figure 4.28,
right side panel). Given the passage of 50 years since lines of loose cobbles were placed to
reconstruct the outline of Room 6, it is highly doubtful that anything remains intact of the room
aside from a possible segment of the eastern wall.
Lacking the “anchor” of Room 6, a new approach to locating and mapping the LCAS rooms was
attempted. The first technique involved making translucent versions of the various maps created
by Leslie (two versions), during the LMAS seismic line surveys, and Speth’s 1984 field visit, and
superimposing those maps on high-resolution aerial photographs. Mark Willis produced the
images and the examples of this technique are displayed in Figure 4.29 through Figure 4.33.

Figure 4.28. Photograph of Room 6 excavated in 1963 (left panel) compared to the photograph of
foundation walls of a room (taken in 2015) that has been identified as Room 6 during previous surveys.

Leslie’s two maps vary considerably in the locations of the pit structure and rooms. His early
map of the site (Leslie 1965a) plots Pit Structure 1 approximately 10 meters to the south of its
true location (Figure 4.29), although both pit structures are accurately plotted in his manuscript
map (Figure 4.30). Room 7 is incorrectly plotted by 15 meters in the 1965 map and by almost 30
meters in his manuscript map. The most troublesome problem is that the locations and
orientations of the surface rooms and roomblocks change from one map to the other. The
differences in Leslie’s maps lead us to conclude that he may have reconstructed the locations of
the surface rooms in one or both maps from memory and the plots may not be accurate.
Speth’s 1984 map (Figure 4.31) is the most accurate of the series, having been mapped using a
transit referenced to a permanent datum. The location of Room 7 is correctly plotted, as are the
two pit structures and several surface rooms and wall segments. The dimensions of the open pit
structure excavations are mapped correctly.
The two LMAS maps of the 1990s exhibit some of the same patterns of previous mapping efforts
(Figure 4.32 and Figure 4.33). The two open excavations are accurately plotted, but again there is
some variation in the placement and orientation of the surface rooms. Room 7 is incorrectly
plotted on the 2006 map.

As deduced from the series of mapping efforts, locating the LCAS surface rooms has proven
difficult. It is apparent that the latter maps used one or another of Leslie’s maps as a template and
then anchored the map to the open pit structure excavations and perhaps to the well-preserved
surface room that we have concluded as misidentified as Room 6.
Noting the problem with Room 6 as well as other discrepancies between the 2015 mapping
results and earlier efforts, it was decided to begin anew and attempt to map the site without using
a template or preconceptions regarding the locations of rooms and roomblocks. The careful
inspection of the surface of the LCAS village area noted distinct patterns of caliche cobbles
between the primary refuse areas and open pit structure excavations. The caliche cobbles likely
represent displaced foundation wall stones. The patterns are subtle but apparent in the highresolution aerial photographs (Figure 4.34). Note the two “corridors” of caliche cobbles
delineated within the black lines. It is important to note that few cobbles are present in the “Vnotch” between the two corridors. Several visible wall segments are located within the corridors,
including the walls of Rooms 9 and 10 and the well-preserved room walls previously identified as
Room 6. Several more subtle wall segments and partially exposed alignments of cobbles were
present but are not visible on the aerial photograph.
Using the combination of aerial imagery and surface plots, the map of surface rooms and
roomblocks was produced (Figure 4.35). The individual rooms were then correlated with Leslie’s
site maps and room planviews. The solution is not perfect and questions remain over the
locations of certain rooms. The only way to truly resolve the matter and develop an accurate map
of the rooms at the Merchant site will be through broad-scale excavations.

Surface and Remote Sensing Investigations at LA 43414

Chapter Summary –
The Prehistoric and Historic Landscape of LA 43414
Two general conclusions can be drawn based on the composite results of the remote sensing and
mapping projects. First of all, we try to maintain a distinction between the Merchant site
proper—the location of the 1959-1965 LCAS excavations—and the larger aggregate site of LA
43414. Merchant site should refer to the LCAS area. However, if the possible agricultural
features are proven to be such features and are related to the occupation and subsistence economy
of the Merchant site, then perhaps that area should be combined with the LCAS area. Of course,
this brings up further issue: what if in the future one of the habitation areas of Loci 3, 4, or 5 are
linked to the LCAS village? These problems will have to be confronted when and if future
excavations take place. For the present time, we refer to the Merchant site interchangeably as the
LCAS village area or the LCAS excavation area and refer to the features and occupation areas of
the larger aggregate site as LA 43414.
The second conclusion, drawn from the first, is that LA 43414 consists of a highly varied and
complex assortment of occupations, features, technologies, and adaptations. Overall, LA 43414
is truly a composite landscape of a succession of occupations and use episodes, all of which
reflect broader adaption and settlement patterns across southeastern New Mexico.
One final benefit of the remote sensing and mapping tasks should be noted. For purposes of longterm management and preservation, one of the most important benefits to the CFO is the utility of
aerial photography and contour mapping as a monitoring tool. The data provides a snapshot of
LA 43414 at four different times between November of 2014 and the spring of 2015. Since the
data contains both 3D and aerial imagery, it can be used to examine how the site changes over
time as a result from erosion, looting, inadvertent damage by oil or seismic exploration, or
recreational use. It can also allow for the detailed exploration of information on the amount of fill
that has been added or removed from an area; something useful for exploring damage caused by
looting. These data are concrete documents that can withstand legal scrutiny and can assist
damage assessments for use in court cases.

Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site

Chapter Five
Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the
Merchant Site
Myles R. Miller, Tim Graves, and Robert H. Leslie

Robert Leslie and the Lea County Archaeological Society documented 21 surface domestic rooms
at the Merchant site and excavated a sample of seven rooms. The primary habitation area of
surface rooms and middens was thoroughly documented during the present project. The area was
surface mapped and remote sensing studies were conducted, including high-resolution aerial
photography and ground penetrating radar. Additional rooms were identified during these
investigations. Refuse areas were located among the domestic structures, including sheet
middens or shallow mounds of prehistoric trash and mounds of modern backdirt from the LCAS
and looter excavations. Sample excavations were completed in the refuse areas. The domestic
and refuse features are the subject of the following chapter.

A Word on the Original Photographs from the Merchant Site
The Merchant site was excavated in the early 1960s, and photographs of the site, features,
excavations, and LCAS participants were taken using the technology of the era: bulky 35 mm
cameras using analog film. Having become accustomed to the high resolution images provide by
digital cameras, we were somewhat taken aback when confronted by the photographic archive
available for the Merchant site.
The photographs displayed in this chapter and following chapters were obtained from several
sources. The two primary sources of photographs are 20 black-and-white contact sheets and two
boxes containing 200 color slides, of which 178 are of features, artifacts, and people at the
Merchant site. The individual photos on the black-and-white contact sheets and the 178 color
slides were digitally scanned and enhanced. Both forms of photographs suffer from one or more
problems. Many of the photographs on the black-and-white contact sheets suffer from problems
typical of inexperienced 35 mm photographers, including unfocused shots and over- or underexposed images. The collection of color slides tends to be better focused and better framed.
However, the images have been affected by color shifts, some of which are extreme, during the
past 50 years of storage. Many of the color slides have a pronounced color shift on the yellow
spectrum; some tend towards red-brown, while a small number of slides retain the original colors
of rocks, soils, and vegetation. It is likely that Leslie and other photographers used different film
brands or exposure speeds. The images presented in the report have been calibrated and adjusted
for color shifts as best as possible, but there is some degree of hue and tint problems that could
not be corrected.

103

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Additionally, we found that certain photographs in the Leslie manuscript were missing from both
the black-and-white contact sheets and color slide collection. One example is the two
photographs of the floor hearth in Room 6. A grainy image of this feature is included in the
Leslie manuscript, but we were unable to locate the original photograph among the contact sheets
and color slides. Accordingly, our only option was to incorporate a scan of the grainy manuscript
image in this chapter.
Given the variety of image types available for the site and the inconsistencies in what type of
photos were available or missing for various contexts, the photographic documentation of certain
features include combinations of black-and-white and color images. Scans from color slides were
used whenever possible; if color images were unavailable, we used scans of images from the
black-and-white contact sheets. Additionally, some of the color images for a feature include
variations in hue, tint, and saturation arising from the corrections for color shifts.

LCAS Surface Rooms
Leslie’s field notes and manuscript provide descriptions of varying detail for 21 surface rooms.
As with all the other features and contexts at the Merchant site, Leslie’s notes and manuscript
describe a continual destruction of rooms and deposits by looters. Some rooms were first
exposed in potholes left by looters and were cleaned and documented by Leslie and LCAS
members, while other rooms in the process of being excavated were damaged by looters while
LCAS members were away from the site. Leslie’s notes indicate that most of the rooms were
damaged by looters. The uncontrolled excavations loosened and displaced the cobbles of room
walls and often penetrated through floors, making it difficult for the LCAS excavators to recover
architectural information.
Both contiguous and isolated rooms were identified. The contiguous rooms were arranged within
two linear roomblocks, one oriented north-to-south and the second roughly oriented east-to-west
(Figure 5.1). The northern roomblock shared a common wall construction beginning with the
northern wall of Room 4 and extending east for approximate 25 m and forming the northern walls
of Rooms 5 , 19, 20, 21, and 22. The northern and western roomblocks appeared to be separated
by a narrow corridor. Leslie’s notes indicate the presence of another common foundation wall
beginning with the faint wall of Room 23 at the southern end of the western roomblock and
serving as the western foundation wall for several undefined rooms.
Four isolated rooms were identified to the south and southwest of the roomblocks. Room 6 was
located a few meters to the south of the northern roomblock and Rooms 12, 13, and 14 were
located around the large pit structure designated as Pithouse 2. Rooms 7 and 14 were mapped a
few meters further to the south of the main habitation area.
Rooms 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 were excavated by Robert Leslie and family members or by Leslie
and members of the LCAS. With the exception of Room 11, the other 13 rooms were probed,
tested, or had upper fill deposits excavated. Small test units were placed against a wall edge and
dug to the floor of some rooms, while in other rooms the floor was not encountered or, if it was,
there is no documentation of that fact. The walls and interior of Room 7 were completely
exposed, but the excavations extended only to the top of the roof fall layer. Room 22 was
discovered when walls were encountered during excavation of a test unit in Refuse Area A and
was not excavated further. Room 14 was almost completely removed during excavations of
prehistoric midden deposits to the west of Pithouse 2 and only a small 6 square foot (75 by
75 cm) remnant could be documented. Room 11 had been pothunted during the 1960s, leaving a
one-meter diameter pothole in the center. Leslie backfilled the hole, but during a visit to the site
in 1975 found that the room had been pothunted again, a testament to the fact that looting
continued for many years after the end of the LCAS investigations. Leslie noted the looter pits
had filled with natural sediments by 1984.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Aerial photography and surface mapping during the 2015 investigations identified additional
rooms and revised the locations of most of the previously mapped rooms (Figure 5.2 and Figure
5.3). As illustrated by Figure 5.2, shallow depressions from the excavation of Rooms 3, 4, and 5
remain, and a few linear arrangements of cobbles marking room walls can still be seen on the
surface and through inspection of the aerial images.
The two roomblocks were found to connect at the northwestern corner (Figure 5.3) and form a
single pueblo in the shape of an inverted “L.” The northern roomblock is oriented at an azimuth
of 120 degrees instead of directly east-west at 90 degrees. The locations or suspected locations of
twelve new rooms (Rooms A through L) were mapped and established that the northern and
western roomblocks consist of two tiers of rooms. Room 6, once considered an isolated southern
room, is now part of the northern roomblock. Two new isolated rooms were mapped (Rooms D
and J), but the small remnant of Room 14 could not be identified among the disturbed midden
deposits to the west of Pit Structure 2. Room 7 is now plotted 130 m south of the main
roomblocks and effectively constitutes a separate habitation area. As noted in Chapter Four, an
additional habitation structure and possible pit features were identified in this area during GPR
investigations.
The condition of the roomblocks and individual rooms in 2015 was variable but overall is
assessed as generally poor. A substantial amount of the surface architecture was disturbed,
obscured, or in some cases destroyed by pothunting and the LCAS excavations. The excavation
and documentation of Room 6 provides an example of the problems encountered by Leslie. The
photograph of Room 6 (discussed below) shows two walls consisting of single lines of loose wall
cobbles, one relatively intact wall, and one wall lacking any construction cobbles. Leslie notes
that the walls of Room 6 were intact when first exposed, but that by the time the photo “…was
taken two weeks later many of these had been disturbed (There were usually several kids with
their parents and several of these seem to have thrived on tearing things up).” Fifty years later,
whatever cobbles once formed the walls of Room 6 have been scattered across the northern
roomblock.
As of 2015, the shallow depressions of some LCAS room excavations can be seen (Figure 5.4),
and a few wall segments remain intact or can be estimated from linear rock arrangements, but the
majority of walls and rooms have been heavily disturbed. Construction cobbles are scattered
throughout and beyond the roomblock locations (Figure 5.5). Accordingly, the locations of some
rooms are inferred from linear patterns of disturbed cobbles and are somewhat conjectural. The
walls of the isolated rooms to the south are in better condition and can be identified in the highresolution aerial photographs and inspection of the site surface. It is likely that some rooms, such
as Room 14, are completely destroyed, while others appear to retain some degree of integrity.
Comparing the upper panel and lower panels of Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5, it is apparent that some
amount of the backdirt and displaced cobbles surrounding the room excavations was backfilled
into the excavated rooms, resulting in artifact mixing and other problems for future excavations.
Some of the photographs show LCAS members screening fill from one house inside an adjacent
house. Despite these observations, a substantial amount of mounded backdirt is located to the
north of the roomblock. It is difficult to differentiate between looted and excavated deposits and
intact prehistoric midden areas, and it is apparent that cultural deposits inside structures and in
extramural refuse areas have been mixed with modern backdirt and spoil piles to varying degrees.
Although it is impossible to determine the original provenience of artifacts and faunal remains
recovered from the LCAS and looter backdirt piles, the materials do provide for a site-level
analysis of subsistence and technological practices.

General Attributes of Domestic Rooms
Leslie’s notes and manuscript provide dimensions for the excavated rooms and some of the tested
or partially excavated rooms, as well the sizes of floor hearths and other interior features.
Summary data for the rooms is provided in Table 5.1. Room walls range from 2.1 to 3.4 m in
length and the rooms have average floor areas of 6.7 square meters with a range of 4.3 to 10.2
square meters. These room dimensions are small when compared to Jornada pueblos and other
Southwestern pueblo settlements. Floor areas of domestic rooms at Jornada pueblos range from 8
to 34 square meters, with an average of 18 square meters (Miller and Graves 2009:364).
The rooms composing the northern and western roomblocks appear to have been constructed
along continuous foundation walls, a typical Southwestern practice of orienting and building a
series of adjoining rooms. Wall foundations consisted of series of caliche cobbles and slabs. The
examples of intact walls measured 25–30 cm in thickness, and a few retained evidence that some
form of caliche and clay mortar had been used to cement and stabilize the foundation.
Some degree of variation is apparent among the orientation of the foundation cobbles, although it
is difficult to determine whether some of the observed variation is due to the continual
disturbance and displacement of walls by looters and some of the avocational archaeologists. The
walls of Rooms 4 and 5 have formal arrangements of slabs and cobbles that alternate direction.
Part of the wall between Rooms 20 and 21 consists of a series of parallel caliche slabs placed
perpendicular to the axis of the wall, while Room 10 had two rows of slabs placed in line parallel
to the wall axis. The foundations of some rooms appear to have been constructed of a single line
of round cobbles, although in some cases the walls may have been disturbed prior to their
mapping and photographing. Entryways were difficult to identify among the disturbed walls, but
gaps in the foundation stones may indicate the presence of entries in some of the rooms.

According to Leslie, the upper fills of rooms consisted of a reddish clay that was interpreted as
roof and wall melt. The thickness of this layer ranged from 13 to 20 cm. Small numbers of
artifacts were present in the clay strata, but trash deposits were mostly restricted to thin, 2.5 to
5 cm layers of refuse on and above the floors of the rooms. Leslie notes that the lower refuse
levels were often a darker reddish hue than the overlying adobe melt layer. Room floors were not
formally prepared and consisted of compacted natural clay sediments with no evidence of formal
plastering or remodeling. Evidence of roof construction was found in two rooms: a small
remnant of a wood support post was found in Room 9 and the partial excavation of Room 13
exposed a series of burned roof latillas or jacal sticks measuring 1 to 3.5 cm in diameter.
Subfloor features were rare, although it must be noted that such features are often difficult to
identify, and postholes, subfloor pits, and other features may have been overlooked by the
avocational excavators or destroyed by looting. Formal floor hearths were present in each of the
excavated rooms with the exception of Room 4. These features were described in some detail by
Leslie, and their attributes are summarized in Table 5.2. Only one extramural feature was
observed: a trash pit (Refuse D) was found outside Room 3 and below the northern wall of Room
4.

Comments

The thin layers of trash on room floors appear to consist primarily of secondary refuse. The few
cases of de facto refuse observed by Leslie and the LCAS excavators include flat caliche
“flagstones” in several rooms, a cache of Chupadero Black-on-white sherds from several vessels
found on the floor of the southeast corner of Room 4, three groundstone tools placed upright
against the wall of Room 9, and a few additional grinding tools in various rooms.
Evidence of stratified occupations was observed in at least two locations. Room 4 was found to
have been constructed over Room 3 and Room 15 was built over Room 8.
Descriptions of Excavated Rooms
Rooms 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 were excavated by LCAS members. All of the rooms have some
form of field and photographic documentation. Rooms 3 and 4 were excavated by Bus Leslie and
his children, Mark and Cindy; the remaining rooms were excavated by the LCAS.
Room 3: Room 3 was excavated by Robert Leslie and his children in 1960. It was described as a
buried room measuring 2.1 m by 2.6 m with floor area of 5.5 square meters (Figure 5.6). It was
positioned below and extends beyond the northern wall of Room 4 and is one of the few
examples of stratified occupations in the LCAS village area. According to the notes and crosssection, a thin layer of refuse fill separated the floors of Rooms 3 and 4. The fill included a 15- to
17.5-cm layer of weathered natural fill (after the room was abandoned) over a 8-cm layer of
reddish clay consisting of wall and roof melt. A 5-cm layer of trash and numerous artifacts was
present above the floor. The roof was surmised to have been constructed of brush and clay
because of the excessive amount of clay above the floors.
Room 3 had an unprepared earthen floor of compact reddish clay with a single floor hearth that
measured 38 by 28 cm and was 18 cm deep. The field notes describe a raised collar 2.5 to 5.1 cm
above the floor (Figure 5.7). The hearth fill consisted of ashy sediments. No entry was detected.
Aside from the floor hearth, the only floor feature was several flat caliche slabs, called
“flagstones” in the field notes, located near the eastern and western walls in line with the central
floor hearth. These were also described as possible support pads for roof support posts or as
112

supports for ceramic pots. A small pit designated as Refuse Area D was located just outside the
eastern wall of Room 3.
Room 4: Room 4 was also excavated in 1960. It was a square surface room between
unexcavated Rooms 18 and 19 and was constructed over Room 3 and its extramural pit, Refuse D
(Figure 5.6). Leslie describes the room as measuring 2.59 m east/west by 2.44 m north/south
with a floor area of 6.3 square meters.
Fill deposits included a 10-cm layer of weathered natural fill (after the room was abandoned) over
a 15-cm layer of reddish clay consisting of wall and roof melt. A 5-cm layer of trash and
numerous artifacts was present above the floor. The roof was surmised to have been constructed
of brush and clay because of the amount of clay in the layer of roof and wall melt.
The western and eastern foundation walls consisted of a single row of caliche cobbles, while the
northern and southern foundations consisted of a double row of caliche slabs and cobbles in
alternating orientations. These walls were 25 to 30.5 cm thick, 25 cm high, and were cemented
with caliche mortar. An entryway was present in the western wall shared with Room 18. Room 4
was the only excavated room that lacked a floor hearth.

Disappointingly few photographs of Room 4 are available. The only useful image is shown in
Figure 5.8 that shows the partially excavated room with the northern wall exposed and the
northern half of the fill cleared. Despite the absence of a floor hearth, Room 4 was one of the few
rooms with de facto artifacts on the floor. A cache of Chupadero Black-on-white bowl sherds
(Figure 5.9) were piled on the southeastern corner of the floor, and a mano and metate were lying
on the northeastern corner on the floor.

Room 4.

Room 5: Room 5 was excavated by the LCAS and individually by Leslie over a period of two
years. The upper fill, thought to be the floor by LCAS members, was excavated in February of
1963. Leslie determined that the LCAS members had exposed the top of the layer or roof and
wall fall, and returned 18 months later in September of 1964 to complete the excavation of the
remainder of the fill and some floor features. The final definition and documentation took place
in March of 1965 and was Leslie’s final excavation work at the site.
Leslie defined Room 5 as a square surface room measuring 2.74 m east/west by 2.49 m
north/south with a floor area of 6.8 square meters (Figure 5.10). Fill deposits included a layer of
weathered natural fill of unknown depth over a 13-cm layer of reddish clay consisting of wall and
roof melt. A thin layer of trash and artifacts was present above the floor.
The northern, western, and part of the eastern foundation walls were of double-coursed caliche
cobbles and slabs placed in alternating directions. The northern wall was 25 cm wide and 31–
35 cm high. The eastern and western walls were 20 cm wide and 25 cm high. The southern half
of the eastern wall was a series of parallel caliche slabs (Figure 5.10 and Figure 5.11). Only a
few scattered cobbles marked the southern wall and a possible entryway in the southeast corner.
All of the walls were cemented with a caliche and clay mortar.
A collared floor hearth was present in the center of the room. In a similar manner to Room 3, flat
caliche slabs had been placed within the floor on opposite sides of the hearth next to the eastern
and western walls.
Room 5 was the deepest and best preserved of the domestic rooms at the Merchant site. The
remnants of the foundation walls were visible during the 2015 investigations (Figure 5.12).

Room 6: Room 6 was excavated during a single weekend in February of 1963 and was
apparently excavated by LCAS members without the assistance or presence of Robert Leslie.
Leslie’s manuscript describes the room as located 3.7 m southeast of Room 5 and isolated from
other rooms. However, a 1963 photograph shows Room 6 sharing a common wall with Room 22
and perhaps the southeast corner of Room 21 (Figure 5.13).
Leslie’s description of the room is based on accounts provided by the LCAS excavators. A
collared floor hearth was present in the center of the room. Several heating stones were present in
the fill of the hearth (Figure 5.14). No other floor features or artifacts were present. The room
was a square surface room measuring 2.54 m northwest/southeast and 2.13 m northeast/southwest
with a floor area of 5.4 square meters (Figure 5.15). A thin layer of natural sediment was present
a thin layer of wall or roof melt and a thin lens of trash was present above the dark red clay floor.
The fill of Room 6 was very shallow compared to other houses in the northern roomblock.
The room was surrounded by a single row of caliche cobbles and was 15 to 20 cm high except in
the northwest corner where a possible entryway was present. As seen in Figure 5.16 of the
completed excavation, most of the foundation cobbles were displaced, and with the exception of
the southeastern corner the wall outlines in the maps and photographs are a reconstruction.

Room 8: Rooms 8, 9, and 10 are part of the western roomblock and were excavated by Leslie and
the LCAS during a couple of weekends in the fall of 1964. Room 8 appears to have been a
deeper pit room, while the other rooms were typical surface rooms. As seen in the photograph of
LCAS members excavating Room 8 (Figure 5.17), the surface rooms had the typical foundation
walls constructed using rough caliche cobbles.

Figure 5.17. LCAS members excavating the western roomblock in 1964. View is facing to the south.
Previously excavated Room 4 is in the foreground below the screened backdirt pile. Individual taking a
photograph is standing at the edge of Room 8 within surface Room 15, and the young boy is kneeling in
Room 16 with Rooms 10 and 9 beyond. The large circular mound of backdirt around Pit Structure 1 can be
seen in the far left background.

Room 8 was discovered in July of 1964 when Leslie and LCAS members discovered that a
looter’s pit at the edge of the escarpment had exposed cultural deposits that were deeper than had
been noted in the surrounding site area. Further exploration discovered that the looter’s pit had
revealed a deep pithouse and had also penetrated through an overlying surface room (Room 15).
It is unclear if the entire subsurface room was excavated. The feature had been cut into the
caliche bedrock and was approximately 51 cm below the surface. The walls of the structure were
defined in the southwest corner. Measurements of the room were taken off the plan map (Figure
5.18). The structure appeared to be an irregular or perhaps oval-shaped house measuring 2.49 m
along the long axis from the southwest to the northeast and 2.18 m along the shorter axis and
having a floor area of at least 4.3 square meters.
Leslie describes a 5- to 8-cm thick clay floor above the caliche bedrock. A thin layer of ash,
burned soil, and artifacts was present on the floor. The fill consisted of-an 8 cm layer of roof or
wall melt below a 5- to 8-cm deposit of natural light red eolian sand. The uppermost stratum
consisted of 10 to 13 cm of sediments mixed with small caliche rocks. The floor of Room 15 was
positioned above that layer. A floor hearth was present in the northeastern corner. The floor was
removed, revealing that the floor hearth had been cut into the underlying caliche bedrock (Figure
120

5.19). Leslie notes that most of the materials recovered during the excavation of Room 8 may
have been associated with Room 15.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Room 9: Room 9 was excavated over a weekend in August of 1964. Leslie notes that foot traffic
and erosion resulting from five years of work at the site had exposed the walls of Room 9, leading
to further investigations of the western roomblock. The room was defined as a square
construction measuring 2.90 m north/south by 2.74 m east/west with a floor area of 7.9 square
meters (Figure 5.20). The northern and southern foundation walls were among the best preserved
examples at the site and consisted of double courses of caliche slabs placed in parallel lines and
measuring 15 to 25 in width (Figure 5.20). A deposit of clay mortar was noted between the
courses. The northern and southern walls were single lines of caliche slabs. A 76 cm-wide gap
was present in the eastern wall and may have been an entryway.
The caliche rocks forming the walls were rectangular in shape and extended 20 cm above a red
clay floor. A 2.5 to 5 cm thick layer of refuse was above the floor and was covered by a thin
layer of reddish to light tan find sands. The roof and wall melt appeared to be mounded in the
central part of the room.
Two floor features and several artifacts were present on the floor of Room 9 (Figure 5.21). A 46cm-diameter floor hearth with a prominent collar was present in the north-center of the room. A
12.7 cm-diameter post mold was located adjacent to the floor hearth. The decomposed remains
of a wood support post were found inside the small pit. A flat caliche rock 25-cm wide had been
set into the floor next to the hearth and was interpreted as a pot rest. Two quartzite hammerstones
were found on the northwest corner of the floor and a cluster of two manos and a basin metate
were propped against the northeast wall.
Room 10: Room 10 was excavated during the same weekend in 1964 as Room 9. The room was
first observed as a few continuous caliche rocks adjacent to Room 9. Excavations revealed a
square surface room measuring 2.74 m north/south by 2.79 m east/west with a floor area of 7.7
square meters (Figure 5.22). The room fill consisted of 2.5 to 5 cm of cultural debris (flakes,
ceramics, and bone slivers) and ash and charcoal above the 10-cm thick clay floor. Above the
floor trash was an 18- to 20-cm layer of wall and roof melt.
The southern wall was shared with Room 9 and had the double-course construction of caliche
slabs. A northeastern remnant of the northern wall appeared to have the same construction, while
the eastern and western walls consisted of single courses of rectangular caliche slabs. A 76-cmwide entryway was present in the northern part of the western wall. Large flat caliche slabs
measuring 60 by 30 cm had been set in the floors on each side of the entryway.
A 46-cm-diameter collared floor hearth was present in the northeast corner of the room. Artifacts
on the floor included a basin metate, a small mano, a grooved abrader, and a bone awl.
Apparently either no photographs were taken or the photographs were misplaced because Leslie
does not include a photo of the room in his manuscript.
The walls of Room 9 and adjacent Room 10 have been affected by erosion and displacement of
the foundation wall cobbles. However, the southern wall of Room 10 and common western wall
of Rooms 9 and 10 could be clearly seen on the site surface during the 2015 fieldwork (Figure
5.23).

Partially Excavated and Looted Rooms
The majority of the domestic rooms at the Merchant site were partially excavated. Some of the
excavations were conducted by Leslie and LCAS members to examine damaged rooms after
looters had exposed portions of walls or fills. Other excavations were more exploratory in nature
and involved clearing the upper fill to define the boundaries of the room or small units dug into
the fill to find floors and artifacts. With the exception of Room 7, none of the rooms were
photographed or mapped and the only documentation on the rooms is provided in Leslie’s
manuscript.
Room 7: Room 7 was partially excavated in February of 1963 during the same period of
fieldwork as Rooms 5 and 6. Room 7 is an isolated room at the far southeastern edge of the
LCAS site, approximately 130 m from the primary roomblocks. Leslie removed the upper layer
of natural fill using a broom and exposed the reddish layer of wall and roof melt but did not
excavate any further into the fill (Figure 5.24). The room measured 3.35 m north/south by 3.05 m
east/west and has a floor area of 10.2 square meters. It is the largest of the domestic rooms
investigated by Leslie and the LCAS and may be the largest of the domestic rooms at the site.
The presence of ash deposits in center of the fill indicates that a central floor hearth is present.
Leslie observed small segments of the northern and eastern foundation walls and noted that
additional cobbles had been displaced around the structure.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Figure 5.24. View of the excavation of the uppermost natural fill of Room 7 in 1963. Portions of the eastern
and northern foundation walls are exposed but most of the walls remain buried.

The 2015 investigations included a GPR survey around Room 7 (see Chapter Four). The structure
is located downslope from the main LCAS village area, and it appears that Room 7 and other
houses are partially or completely buried in this area. The GPR survey identified two probable
structures and several possible pit features, one of which is the buried outlines of Room 7.
Surface inspection of Room 7 also noted that erosion has exposed the eastern part of the structure
and revealed that the entire eastern foundation wall remains intact and buried.
Room 11: Room 11 is another isolated room located near the edge of the escarpment about 20 m
south of Refuse Area B (see Figure 5.3). Erosion had exposed the four walls of the structure and
approximately two-thirds of the interior was “potted” between 1965 and 1976. The potholes
penetrated through the floor and even penetrated to the caliche bedrock in one part of the room.
The walls were not disturbed, allowing for the dimensions to be estimated. The walls were not
measured, but Leslie provides estimates that the room was 2.44 m north/south by 2.75 m
east/west with a floor area of 6.7 square meters. No cultural materials were formally collected
from the room, and Leslie notes that the potholes had infilled by 1984.
Room 12: Room 12 was located at the far eastern edge of the northern roomblock. Leslie’s map
places the room a bit north of Pit Structure 2 and several meters south of the northern roomblock.
The 2015 mapping effort places the room in line with the northern roomblock a bit east of newly
defined rooms H and K. The room was partially excavated by a LCAS member after erosion had
exposed the southern wall as well as the southern segments of the eastern and western walls. The
exposed southern part of the room measured 2.34 m in width, but the length was not determined.
Leslie’s notes state that an LCAS member began the excavation but failed to complete the work.
Leslie noted a clay floor in the room but no further information was available.
126

Chapter Five
Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site

Room 13: Room 13 was an isolated room located at the edge of the refuse deposits between Pit
Structures 1 and 2. While excavating along the western margins of Refuse Area B, Leslie
encountered a deeper stratum with a clay floor approximately 50 cm below the surface. He
excavated a 60-cm trench along the northern edge and a 76-cm trench along the eastern wall,
defining a pithouse structure. The room is notable for being the only example that had burned
construction material (roof latillas or jacal sticks) on the floor. The series of burned wood
branches were positioned 2.5 to 5 cm above the floor, spaced at 5- to 10-cm intervals, and were 1
to 3.5 cm in diameter. The branches were found within a layer of burned clay (daub?) and
organic material. Burned branches and branch impressions were observed in some of the
fragments, along with burned lines or “streaks” that Leslie surmised might be burned grass
thatching. A few items were recovered from the room including a mano and two large rim sherds
from an Ochoa indented jar. According to Leslie’s manuscript, the room was reburied and
remained mostly undisturbed and therefore offers a promising context for future excavation.
Room 14: Room 14 was found during excavations of Refuse Area B to the south of Pit Structure
2. The room was not discovered until most of the structure was removed during excavation of
midden and all that remained intact was a 0.6 square meter remnant of the floor and 76 cm
segment of the northern wall.
Room 15: Room 15 was a square surface room at the northern edge of the western roomblock.
The majority of the room was removed during excavation of the underlying Room 8 and only the
walls were documented (Figure 5.25; see also Figure 5.19). The eastern wall was a solid line of
caliche cobbles mortared with clay 13 cm above the clay floor. A single line of cobbles formed
the southern wall, and the western and northern walls retained only a few cobbles. The room
measured 2.44 m east/west by 2.59 m north/south with a floor area of 6.3 square meters. The fill
was a 10- to 13-cm layer of soil with few artifacts. Leslie notes that artifacts from Room 15 were
likely mixed with Room 8.

8 (mislabeled as Room 4 in the photo).

Room 16: Room 16 adjoined the eastern wall of Room 15 at the northern end of the western
roomblock. The presence of the room was suggested on the basis of small test excavations
around Rooms 8 and 10 and small wall stubs leading from the eastern wall of Room 15. The
room was not investigated and the size and depth and other attributes remain unknown, although
Leslie includes some artifacts from the room in his description.
Room 17: Room 17 was located at the southern end of the western roomblock and was identified
in a small test unit placed south of Room 9. The size of the test excavation was not described
other than noting it was placed along the southern wall of Room 9. The floor of the room
consisted of a dark red clay and was encountered 13 to 15 cm below the surface. No foundation
walls were described in Leslie’s manuscript, but during the 2015 investigations wall outlines were
observed on the western and southern sides of the room (Figure 5.26). Aside from the small test
excavation, the room remains intact and undisturbed.

Figure 5.26. Room 17 as it appeared in 2015 with outlines of the western and southern foundation walls
visible on the surface.

Room 18: Room 18 was located to the west side of Room 4 at the northwest corner of the two
room blocks. Eolian erosion had exposed the southern wall, and LCAS members excavated a 60by-60-cm unit in the southeastern corner. A floor was contacted at 15 cm below the surface and
consisted of a dark red clay that could be easily differentiated from the lighter fill above. Much
of the room had been covered by backdirt during the excavation of adjacent rooms (while this
resulted in some mixing of deposits, it also served to protect the room from looters). The room
was not excavated and most of the deposits remain intact. The 2015 investigations noted that
continued erosion has exposed the eastern, western, and northern walls of the room (Figure 5.27).
Room 19: Room 19 adjoined the eastern wall of Room 4 and shared a common southern fountain
wall with Rooms 4, 5, 20, 21, and 22. Leslie excavated two areas in the room and encountered a
dark red clay floor in both locations, one along the northern wall and the second in the southwest
corner. The depths of the fill and floor were not described, and the only artifacts were from a
small pocket of refuse near the northern wall. The only information on walls is from the shared
wall with Room 4. Inspection of the area during the 2015 fieldwork noted a slight depression and
lines of disturbed construction cobbles in this area of Room 19 (Figure 5.28).

Room 20: Room 20 adjoined the western wall of Room 5 in the northern roomblock. A 60-by60-cm unit was placed along the center of the eastern wall, exposing a 20-cm thick layer of roof
and wall melt. Several artifacts were found on the floor below the fill. The northern wall was
quite apparent during the 2015 investigations.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Room 21: Room 21 adjoined the eastern wall of Room 5 and the shared common wall and
southern foundation wall were apparent to Leslie during the excavations. A 46-cm wide by 1.20m long trench was excavated from the northern wall to the southwest corner of the room. The fill
consisted of weathered natural deposits overlying a layer of roof and wall melt with a thin layer
of trash and a floor below. The remainder of the room was not excavated and remains in good
condition.
Room 22: Room 22 was located next to Room 21 and adjoins the northern wall of Room 6 (see
Figure 5.13). The presence of the room was unknown until 1965 and was one of the places where
LCAS members parked their vehicles during excavations. Leslie also notes that the line of rocks
marking the walls of Rooms 21 and 22 were placed there by children. However, a close
inspection seems to show the rocks firmly embedded in the hard clay. No formal excavations
were conducted in the room. Leslie describes a somewhat chaotic scene of 25 LCAS members
and non-members working at the site one weekend when one couple started to dig
indiscriminately in an area north of Room 6 and encountered some deposits that remain
undescribed. There is also a description of LCAS members tracing the northern wall of Room 22
and finding that it continued further to the east, indicating that additional rooms were present at
the eastern end of the roomblock. The 2015 investigations verified the presence those additional
rooms (Room H, I, and K).
Room 23: Room 23 was located as the southernmost room of the western roomblock at the
southwest corner of Room 17. A 90-cm-long section along the southeastern corner was cleared
exposing several cobbles. A floor was contacted 14 cm below the surface. Only the southeastern
corner was exposed and the size of the room could not be determined. Continued erosion has
exposed the walls of this house, and the western and southern walls could be clearly seen on the
site surface during the 2015 fieldwork.
Rooms Identified during 2015 Fieldwork
Surface inspection, site mapping, aerial photography, and GPR survey conducted during the 2015
investigations identified 13 new or possible rooms in the LCAS village area. Several of the
rooms were where Leslie and LCAS members suspected additional rooms existed on the basis of
faint wall segments seen eroding from the surface or exposed during excavations of other rooms.
For example, Leslie noted a line of cobbles approximately 2.4 m to the west of the western walls
of Rooms 9 and 10 and near the edge of the escarpment. Brushing away the topsoil revealed two
segments of foundation walls measuring 1.1 and 1.8 meters in length. The walls were included on
his site map (see Figure 5.1) and indicated that the western roomblock consisted of two tiers of
rooms. Our investigations in 2015 verified that another wall and three rooms (designated Rooms
A, B, and C) are present in that area between Rooms 15 and 23.
We also found what we suspect are additional rooms adjoining the northern walls of Rooms 5, 19
and 20 (Room E, F, and G) and additional rooms at the eastern edge of the northern roomblock
(Rooms H, I, K, and L). Two more isolated rooms (Rooms D and J) were also recorded. As
noted earlier, many of the foundation walls were disturbed in the past and cobbles are scattered
throughout the village area. However, close inspection can often identify the faint outlines of
wall remnants, such as seen for newly identified Room K (Figure 5.29).
In the absence of excavation, the only information that could be documented for the new rooms is
their location and estimated surface dimensions. These data are provided below in Table 5.3. It is
also noted that GPR survey of the parcel surrounding Room 7 at the southern edge of the LCAS
area identified what is suspected to be an additional buried house (Room M).

Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site
Leslie mapped and documented four areas described as “refuse areas” (Figure 5.30) Refuse
Areas A, B, and C were broad distributions of artifacts, bone, and other trash deposits; Refuse
Area D was a trash pit outside Room 3 and overlaid by the wall of Room 4. Refuse Area A was
located to the north of the northern roomblock, and Refuse Area B was a broad area of sheet
middens and low mounds around Pit Structure 2 and to the west and south of the structure.
Refuse Area C was a thick layer of trash spread along the gully cutting into the escarpment at the
southern edge of the LCAS habitation area. Additional areas of backdirt and refuse were mapped
and recorded during the 2015 investigations. The refuse and backdirt mounds are summarized in
Table 5.4.
The practice of screening fill deposits from rooms and middens and other features adjacent to the
location being excavated resulted in a situation where the prehistoric refuse deposits were often
mixed with and buried under piles of screened backdirt. In many locations, and particularly
Refuse Area A, it is difficult or impossible to distinguish between the prehistoric midden deposits
and modern backdirt deposits. If all or most artifacts had been collected from the screened
deposits it might be possible to differentiate between the sterile screened deposits and the artifactrich prehistoric midden deposits. However, our excavations in areas that were clearly modern
backdirt piles recovered thousands of artifacts, establishing that only select artifacts like projectile
points or groundstone tools were collected from the screened cultural deposits.
Leslie also notes that some of the prehistoric refuse areas were mounded, but again, it is
impossible to differentiate prehistoric refuse mounds from the extensive backdirt mounds across
much of the site. The backdirt mounds in Refuse Area A contain large quantities of caliche
cobbles that must have been part of the foundation walls that had collapsed into the fill of
structures. The stones were removed during the excavation of the room fills and were discarded
among the backdirt mounds at the edge of the northern roomblock.
In addition to the combination of prehistoric refuse deposits and modern backdirt deposits
comprising Refuse Areas A, B, and C, several additional locations of modern backdirt were
mapped during the 2015 investigations. Finally, Leslie describes how the mass of animal bone
from Zone E of Pit Structure 1 was dumped off the edge of the escarpment to the west of the pit
structure. This area was surveyed and hundreds of large and medium mammal bone fragments
were identified across the surface of the sloping terrace.

Refuse Area A (Feature 104)
Refuse Area A was located along the northern edge of the northern roomblock and around the
northwestern corner near Room 3. Leslie’s map shows the area as a 22.9 m east/west by 9.1 to
12.2 m north/south midden area. The deposit ranged from 46 to 51 cm in depth in the center and
thinning towards the margins. Leslie found no evidence of mounded deposits but noted that the
area had been heavily disturbed by looters and collectors. Two LCAS members stated that a
shallow mound was once visible. Leslie documented and classified the artifacts excavated by the
LCAS members.
During the LCAS excavations of rooms in the northern roomblock, the fills from room interiors
and extramural areas were screened over this refuse area, forming several large mounds of soil
and debris that are visible today. The deposits extend over an irregular area measuring 14.6 m
east/west by 10.0 m north/south and covering approximately 92 square meters as calculated by
GIS. The mounds range from 20 to 40 cm in height and consist of dark charcoal-stained midden
soils, artifacts, and fire-cracked rock. The deposits also contained large quantities of caliche
cobbles that were probably disturbed components of foundation walls found in fills and outside
rooms that were tossed on top of the backdirt piles (Figure 5.31).

134

Chapter Five
Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site

Figure 5.31. View of the eastern half of Refuse Area A showing the mound of midden soils, debris, and
quantities of caliche cobbles that were probably from collapsed and disturbed foundation walls.

Surface collections of Refuse Area A were limited to diagnostic and unique artifacts. The
collections included 19 Ochoa Indented sherds, a Harrell projectile point, and a few stone and
groundstone tools. Numerous flakes, fire-cracked rock, and small bone fragments were present
on the surface. Some of the midden mounds were covered by a layer of caliche cobbles that may
have helped preserved the underlying deposits. The layer of rocks also seemed to have served as
a catchment for fine sediments and preserved an underlying layer of fine and relatively sterile
sediments that actually served to hide the substantial artifact densities in the deposits from
detection during surface survey.
Excavation unit 3 was a 1 m by 4 m unit placed in one of the larger mounds in the eastern half of
the refuse area (Figure 5.32). The unit was excavated in 1 m by 2 m subunits and as a single
cultural level that ranged from 4 cm deep at the edges to 38 cm deep in the mounded center. The
sediments consisted of a uniformly dark and charcoal-stained deposit of reddish-brown sandy
loam with moderate amounts of natural gravels and numerous caliche cobbles.
A surprising find was a sheet of black plastic encountered at the base of the excavation unit. The
plastic marked the boundary between the cultural deposits and underlying stratum of sterile
reddish-brown sandy loam (Figure 5.33). Leslie does not mention any practice of placing sheet
plastic before or during excavations. Our conclusion (based on details provided below) is that the
sheet was used during some aspect of the LCAS or collector excavations (cover a house or used
to sort artifacts?), was discarded and subsequently buried by the uncontrolled excavations in the
surrounding refuse areas and by backdirt from the adjacent rooms.

Figure 5.33. View of the profile of the excavation through a portion of Refuse Area A. Note the black plastic
that was left by the LCAS excavators or collectors sometime in the early 1960s. The stratum of reddishbrown soil below the plastic sheet was culturally sterile.

The majority of the refuse deposit was screened through a ¼-inch wire mesh with a small sample
screened through a 1/8-inch mesh. Very high counts of small tertiary thinning flakes were
recovered from the sample screened through the smaller mesh, a finding that is consistent with
the very high numbers of projectile points recovered from the Merchant site. Aside from the
tertiary flakes, the excavation of Unit 3 recovered 822 items, including 355 chipped stone
artifacts, 5 projectile points, 47 groundstone items, 167 ceramic sherds, 247 bones, and 1 piece of
pigment. Additionally, 245 small fire-cracked rock fragments weighing 15.1 kg were noted in the
unit.
The volume of excavated sediment was 0.81 cubic meters that yields density calculations of 710
artifacts and 305 bones per cubic meter of sediment. Based on these densities and an estimated
total volume of 18.6 cubic meters, Refuse Area A could contain approximately 13,206 artifacts
and 5,673 bone specimens.
Yet is must be noted that these counts and densities are biased as a result of the uncontrolled
excavations that took place in the 1960s. Several attributes of the overall assemblage are
noteworthy in this regard. Perhaps the most conspicuous evidence of assemblage bias is the fact
that only 4 projectile points were recovered. This represents less than 0.5 percent of the artifacts
and certainly does come near to the count of 433 projectile points reported by Leslie for the
uncontrolled excavations in Refuse Area A. Very few sherds measuring over 4 or 5 cm in
diameter were present, nor were many complete groundstone tools recovered. The fill also
contained numerous fragments of clear and amber bottle glass and one Budweiser beer can.
137

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

The mounded deposits of Refuse Area A and perhaps most of the refuse area consist of a mix of
heavily disturbed prehistoric midden deposits mixed with backdirt from adjacent rooms. Based
on the presence of the black plastic sheet overlying sterile soils, it is apparent that the entire
deposit is a mixed modern formation. Both the prehistoric midden and room fills had been
screened by collectors and LCAS members, and projectile points, large sherds, whole
groundstone tools, and certain formal chipped stone tools were selectively removed. Animal
bone, broken groundstone, fire-cracked rock, and most of the chipped stone debitage and was
ignored and returned to the deposits.
Refuse Area B (Feature 110)
Refuse Area B was located in the east-central area of the LCAS village area around Pit Structure
2. Leslie’s map shows the area as a 15.2 m east/west by 18.3 m north/south midden area with a
slight mound near the southeastern edge that was 61 cm high. The deposit averaged about 60 cm
in depth in the center and thinning towards the margins to depths of around 15 cm and also
covered Pit Structure 2 to a depth of 31 cm. Leslie found no evidence of mounded deposits but
noted that the area had been heavily disturbed by looters and collectors. Two LCAS members
stated that a shallow mound was once visible. Leslie documented and classified the artifacts
excavated by the LCAS members.
The LCAS worked in Refuse Area B at the same time as Area A, and the same practices of
uncontrolled excavation and backdirt dumping took place (Figure 5.34). During the LCAS
excavations of Pit Structure 2 and Room 14, a large quantity of backdirt was spread over portions
of Refuse Area B, forming several large mounds of soil and debris that are visible today (Figure
5.35). Additional artifact screening and collecting throughout the deposit created additional
mounds and trenches. Through time, the mounds grew in distance and size to cover the walls of
surface Room 14 to a depth of 15 to 20 cm. Room 13 may have been constructed over a thin
layer of early midden deposits in this area and was buried by 25 to 30 cm of disturbed deposits
and backdirt. Leslie was able to document some of the LCAS collections from Refuse Area B
and collected samples of artifact exposed on backdirt piles after rainstorms.
In 2015, the deposits were mapped and found to extend over an irregular area measuring 19.2 m
east/west by 30 m north/south and covering approximately 500 square meters. The deposits
include the ring of backdirt around Pit Structure 2, extend 12 m westward to the edge of the
northern roomblock and almost 20 m to the south around Room 14. The mounds range from 40
cm in height to almost 60 cm around the structure and consist of dark charcoal-stained midden
soils, artifacts, and fire-cracked rock. As noted for Refuse Area A, the deposits contained large
quantities of caliche cobbles that were probably components of foundation walls (see Figure
5.35).

Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site

Surface collections of Refuse Area A were limited to diagnostic and unique artifacts. The
collections included 13 Ochoa Indented sherds and a few stone and groundstone tools. Numerous
flakes, fire-cracked rock, and small bone fragments were present on the surface.
Excavation unit 4 was a 1 m by 2 m unit placed in one of the larger mounds near the southern
edge of the refuse area (Figure 5.36). The unit was excavated in two levels that ranged from 18
cm deep at the edges to 57 cm deep in the mounded center. The first level was from 2 to 42 cm
deep. The sediments consisted of a uniformly dark and charcoal-stained deposit of reddish-brown
sandy loam with moderate amounts of natural gravels and caliche cobbles. Excavation of the
level was ended at that depth because, unlike the situation observed in Refuse Area A, intact
prehistoric midden deposits were found. Level 2 was excavated another 14 to 18 cm to a light tan
sandy loam with caliche inclusions that was sterile.
In the northeast corner of the unit, the upper level of a baking pit feature was encountered (Figure
5.37). This feature, designated as B.1, had several large cobbles lining the perimeter and an
interior of dark gray charcoal-stained sediments. The feature was not excavated but was sampled
for radiocarbon and provided an inception date for the overlying midden deposits.
The refuse deposits of Unit 4 were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh and recovered 1,304
items, including 537 chipped stone artifacts, 5 projectile points, 34 groundstone items, 243
ceramic sherds, and 485 bones. Additionally, 147 small fire-cracked rock fragments weighing
12 kg were noted in the unit. The volume of excavated sediment was 0.80 cubic meters that
yields density calculations of 1,024 artifacts and 606 bones per cubic meter of sediment. Based
on these densities and an estimated total volume of 38.2 cubic meters, Refuse Area B would
contain approximately 39,116 artifacts and 23,149 bone specimens.
As noted for Refuse Area A, these counts and densities are biased as a result of the uncontrolled
excavations. Again, the low projectile point counts are conspicuous. Only 5 projectile points
were recovered, representing less than 0.4 percent of the artifacts recovered during the 2015
excavation. Leslie notes that the LCAS recovered at least 219 points from the area. Modern
trash was found throughout the upper level but was absent from the lower level, again indicating
that some midden areas may remain intact. However, most of Refuse Area B is evaluated as a
disturbed prehistoric midden deposit mixed with screened backdirt from adjacent room
excavations with the majority of projectile points, large sherds, and intact groundstone tools
collected by the LCAS and artifact collectors.
Feature B.1: Feature B.1 was identified at the base of Level 2 in Unit 2. The exposed portion
measured 0.84 m by 0.76 m and was classified as a baking pit. The feature was left intact and
reburied. Charcoal recovered from the top of the feature was submitted for radiocarbon dating.
The age estimate is 610 ± 30 B.P. (Beta 434520; δ13C = -23.3 ‰), cal A.D. 1290 to 1410
(calibrated at 2σ). The age estimate establishes that the baking pit and formation of the overlying
midden deposits were generally contemporaneous with the occupation of Pit Structure 1 and the
domestic rooms in the LCAS area.

Refuse Area C
A broad and relatively deep gully is present along the escarpment about 22 m southeast of Pit
Structure 1 and 20 m to the south of Pit Structure 2. This area seemed to have been a favored
location for trash disposal throughout the occupation of the village area. Leslie designated the
location as Refuse Area C and noted that an unknown individual had dug a few potholes in the
area, exposing dense and deep midden deposits. Leslie excavated a 3-by-6-foot (90-by-180-cm)
unit. The unit was excavated to a depth of 115 cm below the surface, at which point the sterile
Pleistocene-age red clay substrate was encountered (Figure 5.38). His profile of the unit shows
several angled and alternating layers of refuse and natural deposits that are parallel to the slope
and contours of the gully.

Figure 5.38. Redrafted version of Leslie’s profile of a test unit placed in Refuse Area C.

Leslie notes that the collections from Refuse Area C may be the best preserved of the midden
deposits at the site and may provide the more representative examples of artifacts from refuse
deposits. He also hints that material from earlier occupations may be in stratified contexts below
materials deposited during later occupations. The area was examined during the 2015 fieldwork.
Fifty years of erosion and deposition had altered the surface appearance of the deposits, and it
appears that much of the original stratigraphy and organic sediments were eroded, leaving only
scatters of artifacts across the Pleistocene clay strata. It is possible, however, that some remnants
of the prehistoric midden remain intact and buried by a thin mantle of alluvial sediment.

144

Chapter Five
Surface Rooms and Refuse Areas at the Merchant Site

Refuse Area D
Refuse Area D was a small basin-shaped pit or pocket of refuse just outside the eastern edge of
Room 3 (Figure 5.39). The common foundation wall of Rooms 4 and 19 had been constructed
over the pit. Leslie described the pit as a natural depression in the caliche bedrock that was filled
with trash. It measured 102 cm east/west by 81 cm north/south and was 46 cm deep. A variety of
artifacts was found within the pit, including ceramics, projectile points, lithic and groundstone
tools, a complete bone awl, partial bone rasp, and several charred acorns.

Figure 5.39. Redrafted version of Leslie’s planview and profile of Refuse Area D, a trash pit outside Room
3. No scale was provided on the original figure.

Bone Dump along Escarpment and Modern Backdirt Mounds
The final areas of trash to be described are modern creations. The LCAS excavation of Pit
Structure 1 encountered a 30-cm-thick mass of faunal remains designated as Zone E. Leslie notes
that the mass of bone removed from Zone E was dumped off the edge of the escarpment to the
west of the structure. The nature of the bone in this deposit is a critical point of interest for
interpreting what may have been an act of ritual closure or a feasting deposit.
The escarpment slope was surveyed during the 2015 fieldwork and the location of the bone dump
was identified (Figure 5.40). Bones were plotted for a distance of almost 25 meters, indicating
that the large masses of bones from Zone E were discarded during several trips and at several
locations along the terrace. A total of 431 large and medium mammal bone fragments were
identified and collected for analysis.

In addition to Refuse Areas A, B, C, and D described by Leslie, the 2015 investigations mapped
several additional areas of backdirt left from the LCAS excavations of rooms (see Figure 5.30 and
Table 5.4). Backdirt mounds were easily identified by the presence of mounded deposits
containing high densities of caliche nodules and cobbles and fire-cracked rock that are typical of
screened deposits. The mounds also contained quantities of animal bone, chipped stone debitage,
and small sherds that were not collected by the LCAS crews or looters. The five newly mapped
areas include small shallow backdirt mounds near Rooms 7, 10, and J, a small area to the west of
Pit Structure 2, and a small area at the northwestern edge of Refuse Area A. The backdirt areas
near structures and rooms were small, thin mounds of screened room fill ranging from 3 to 16
square meters in areas and 5 to 10 cm in height.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the
Merchant Site
Tim Graves, Myles R. Miller, and Robert H. Leslie

Among the many and varied features at the Merchant site, perhaps the most intriguing are the two
large and deep pit structures investigated by Robert Leslie and the Lea County Archaeological
Society. The two structures, designated as Room 1 and Room 2 by Leslie and the LCAS, were
located to the south and east of the main roomblock. We have chosen to refer to the two
structures as pit structures. Pit structure is a relatively neutral term describing an architectural
structure constructed as a pit or within a pit. We avoid the use of the terms “pithouse” and
“room” since they tend to assign or connote a domestic function to the structure. When these
structures are compared to the domestic rooms described in the previous chapter, it is clear that
they represent a very different form of construction and function.
To anyone familiar with prehistoric and historic Southwest settlements, the two structures appear
to be kivas or a similar form of communal architecture. Domestic structures are rarely as large as
the two pit structures, nor are domestic structures typically excavated through nearly a meter of
carbonate-cemented caliche conglomerate topped by laminated indurated caliche. Yet, lacking
detailed excavation data, the nature of the two structures has remained speculative. To determine
whether or not they served as communal architecture requires detailed information on the
construction details, the floor and subfloor features, and the manner in which they were
abandoned.
Unfortunately, such efforts are hindered by the history of looting that took place at the Merchant
site. Leslie describes a constant struggle to maintain consistent excavations and provenience and
document the architecture of the two pit structures against a constant onslaught of looting and
artifact mining throughout the interior deposits. In one passage he describes how the LCAS
attempted to excavate a particular location in stratigraphic levels, being careful to screen the dirt
outside the structure. Upon returning to the site, Leslie found that looters had undermined part of
their excavation and had left screened backdirt inside the structure and spread across their
excavation area. He noted that the backdirt contained many bone and chipped stone artifacts and
thus it was apparent that the fill had been mined for the artifacts, “goodies and pretty items” as he
called them.
The looters often caused substantial damage. Leslie also describes how looters would follow a
layer of refuse (a productive context for projectile points and other collectible artifacts) like
miners, digging sloping shafts and adits into the sides of the exposed refuse deposits. The holes
would then collapse, leaving large chunks of fill and debris inside the rooms. Of course,
147

attempting to identity and trace walls proved futile under such circumstances and the size of the
structures had to be estimated from the partial floor surfaces exposed in the pits.
The two pit structures are discussed in sequence. For each structure, the LCAS excavations are
reviewed first, followed by the 2015 re-excavation efforts to remove backwashed refuse deposits
and identify any remnants of floors and floor features. The LCAS excavations are described in
some detail, as are the unfortunate effects of looting and artifact collecting. The ability to
interpret the form and function of the two structures as well as their remodeling and abandonment
histories are, in a large part, contingent upon how badly certain fill strata and architectural
attributes were damaged by looting.
The intent of this chapter is to provide a descriptive account of the two excavations of pit
structures that were conducted fifty years apart. Interpretations regarding the possible form and
function of the two structures are presented in the summary chapter of the report. Basic
tabulations of artifacts counts are provided, but as with the previous chapter on domestic rooms
and refuse areas, the primary artifact data are reviewed in greater detail in Chapter Twelve.

PIT STRUCTURE 1
LCAS Excavation of Pit Structure 1
Upon first arriving at the Merchant site in 1959, Leslie noted that a large area of midden deposits
and artifacts near the edge of the escarpment was being looted. The first photograph of the
location (Figure 6.1) shows two looter pits measuring around 1.5 to 2 m in length and perhaps a
meter or more in depth. Leslie and several members of the LCAS decided to salvage what
information was possible from the site before it was destroyed by looters and collectors. The
following Saturday, the LCAS crew returned to the site and began working in what was
designated “Room 1.” The excavations continued sporadically over the following 12 months
with LCAS crews ranging from two to six members.
The LCAS crew first expanded the excavation around the two pits and observed that the fill had a
clearly defined stratigraphy and what appeared to be a floor surface could be seen in the walls at a
depth of around one meter. Realizing that they were competing for time against several looters,
Leslie and the LCAS developed a strategy of excavating small units, 12 inches wide (30.5 cm),
through the meter of fill deposits to the floor. The reasoning was that it would be futile to attempt
to remove the entire fill level by level given that large areas of the fill and stratigraphy could be
destroyed by looting during any weekend that the LCAS was not working at the site, and thus it
would be best to obtain stratigraphic data from one small section at a time. Deposits were
screened through ¼-inch mesh, except for certain features or unusual areas that were screened
through ⅛-inch mesh. Artifacts were bagged and labeled according to unit and level or stratum.
Stratigraphy of Pit Structure 1
Leslie identified several strata in Pit Structure 1 and designated them as “zones.” Apparently the
stratigraphy and zones were identified through the small-scale excavations and by examining the
intact strata exposed in the profiles of looter pits. Nine strata and two floor surfaces were
identified (Figure 6.2; Table 6.1). Leslie provides detailed and often insightful descriptions of the
strata, including measurements, soil descriptions, and artifact counts. Unfortunately, very few
photographs of the LCAS excavations of the looter pits clearly show the stratigraphy. The
stratigraphy of Pit Structure 1 is reviewed first because the following discussion of the sequence
of LCAS excavations alternating with episodes of looting continually refers to these strata.

The nine strata include natural deposits of eolian and backwashed sediments or caliche eroded
from the conglomerate layer, refuse deposits, floor fill, and roof fall. The strata and floors reflect
two occupations that were followed by periods of abandonment or disuse. Zones I, H, and G
were associated with the first floor and subsequent abandonment; Zones E, C, B, and A occurred
after the occupation and abandonment of the second floor. Zone C appears to be a major episode
or interval of trash dumping along the eastern wall that was soon followed by another major
depositional event represented by the mass of faunal remains comprising Zone E. According to
the cross-section Zone D was a stratigraphic unconformity as it appears to cut through the second
floor, but it is likely that construction of the second floor simply ended at the point where the
builders encountered the mass of caliche.
Zone A: Zone A was the uppermost layer of natural fill consisting of accumulations of eolian
sediments and clay and caliche sediments washed in from the surrounding ground surface. It
ranged in thickness from 45 cm in the center of the structure to 15 cm around the edges. Artifact
counts were considerably lower than the underlying refuse layers, with comparatively small
counts of 50 projectile points and 81 ceramics recovered. The deposit was cemented by caliche
and clay, was very hard to excavate, and was easily differentiated from the softer and more friable
deposits of Zone B below. Figure 6.3 shows several solid masses of Zone A deposits that had
fallen into the room after looters had undermined the stratum by digging into the artifact-rich
Zone B refuse deposits.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Figure 6.3. Sections of Zone A deposits collapsed into Pit Structure 1 after looters had dug out the
underlying Zone B and C refuse deposits. Mark Leslie serves as a scale allowing the size and extent of the
disturbances to be estimated.

Zone B: Zone B was a 15- to 25-cm thick deposit of refuse consisting of many large and small
bone fragments, ceramics, chipped stone, sand and some ash. Leslie notes that Zone B differed
from Zone C by having greater numbers of large bone fragments and from Zone E in having
artifact refuse while Zone E was almost entirely faunal remains. Leslie suggests that the stratum
was a mix of refuse, bone from Zone E, and natural sediments from Zone A. Artifact counts
increased slightly from the mostly natural deposits in Zone A, with totals of 71 projectile points
and 491 ceramics collected.
151

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Zone C: Zone C consisted of a dense trash deposit that covered the eastern end of the room from
a point about 15 cm below the surface and sloping towards the upper floor for a distance of 1.5 m
from the east wall. The stratum was thickest near the wall and measured 90 cm at that point.
Dense concentrations of trash were found throughout the deposit, including many artifacts and
faunal remains. Although the volume of Zone C was less than several other zones, the highest
count of projectile points (244) and second highest number of ceramic sherds (1,383) were
recovered from the deposit. Unlike other strata throughout the structure, Zone C was mostly
undisturbed by looters and offers a relatively unbiased assemblage.
Zone D: Zone D was a small layer of caliche weathered from the top of the walls and deposited
along the eastern side of the pit structure. Leslie interprets the deposit as forming after first
abandonment of the structure since the roof fall associated with the first floor was
stratigraphically positioned below the caliche. Leslie also notes that the second floor was built
over the caliche, but his profile shows the second floor abutting the upper part of Zone D. No
artifacts or faunal remains were recovered from the level.
Zone E: Zone E was an interesting stratum measuring 38 cm in thickness and consisting almost
entirely of animal bone. The majority of the bone was described as large animals that Leslie
tentatively identified as bison, deer, and antelope. A minor quantity of small bones from rabbits
and other small mammals was present. The bone was mixed within a matrix of sandy clay.
While the deposit contained thousands of animal bones, the count of 18 projectile points is lower
and the count of 124 ceramics is only slightly higher than the numbers recovered from the natural
deposits of Zone A.
Zone F: Zone F is a 15-cm thick layer of sediment and artifacts lying on the uppermost of two
floors in the structure. The upper 10 cm consisted of reddish sandy clay that was sterile. The
lower 5 cm in contact with the floor had several trash areas with moderate artifact densities.
Totals of 92 projectile points and 531 sherds were recovered from the lower 5 cm.
Floor 2: The second of two floors was positioned below Zone F and above Zone G. No
description of the floor was provided in the site manuscript, but one photograph shows the floor
as a smooth and level 2-cm thick surface of compact clay.
Zone G: Zone G was an almost entirely sterile deposit situated below the upper floor and the roof
fall stratum associated with the lower (first) floor. The deposit averaged 15 cm in thickness,
consisted of loose reddish clay, and was completely sterile. Leslie suggested that Zone G was
wind-deposited sediments accumulated after abandonment of the first floor.
Zone H: Zone H was a layer of roof fall associated with the occupation of the lower floor. Some
burned caliche and unburned caliche gravels were present in the upper part of the stratum, and the
lower portion appeared to consist of reddish roofing clay. No wood construction elements
remained intact, but Leslie states that they noticed a couple of areas of soil with a different color
that may have been caused by decayed construction wood. Remnants of the clay roof were found
at the eastern edge of the deposit below the Zone D caliche. The roof fragments were 8 cm thick
and were up to 20 cm in diameter. Impressions of latillas and possibly small cross-section
branches were visible on one side of the roof fragments. The reverse sides had numerous small
streaks that resembled impression left by grass thatching. Few artifacts were recovered from
Zone H, and Leslie combined the artifacts from this stratum with the inventory of material
recovered from Zone I.
Zone I: Zone I is the lowermost floor with approximately 5 cm of floor contact artifacts and
refuse on the floor. The highest count of ceramics (1,691) and second highest count of projectile
points (102) were recovered from the combined Zones H and I. An inverted sandstone metate
with a mano underneath was found in Zone I on the floor.
152

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Floor 1: The first and lowermost of the floors was positioned below Zone I and the caliche
conglomerate substrate. The floor was described as a smooth surface of compacted soil
consisting of a mix of caliche and clay that was exceptionally hard when mixed with water.
Arbitrary Levels in Unit C-2: Leslie excavated a 1.5 m by 1.5 m (5 by 5 feet) section near the
eastern wall around Zone C in arbitrary 6 inch (15 cm) levels. The excavation was designated as
C-2, and the fill and artifact contents of each level were described. Since the horizontal extent of
Zone C became progressively larger with depth, little of the deposit was present in the uppermost
levels while the lower levels consisted mostly of Zone C refuse deposits. The upper surface to 15
cm was within Zone A and contained a few artifacts. A small part of the 15–30 cm level was in
Zone C while the remainder consisted of more Zone A deposits. Thirty-two ceramics and eight
projectile points were recovered. The 30–45 cm level was approximately 50 percent Zone C and
50 percent Zone A, and 63 ceramics and 12 projectile points were recovered. Approximately 60
percent of the 45–60 cm level consisted of Zone C refuse deposits, including a dense pocket of
white ash (Figure 6.4) that was interpreted as the cleaned and discarded contents of a firepit.
Small fragments of charred bone and 22 charred acorn fragments were in the ash deposit.
Artifact counts from the level included 82 ceramics and 15 projectile points.

Figure 6.4. Deposit of ash in Unit C-2 in Zone C. Whether this deposit was found in the 45-60 cm level or
the 75-90 cm level cannot be determined from Leslie’s photographic log.

153

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

The 60–75 cm level consisted mostly of Zone C deposits and contained 96 ceramics and 19
projectile points. The 75–90 cm level was entirely Zone C deposits. The level contained an ash
deposit with charred bone and acorn fragments similar to that noted for the 45–60 cm level.
Artifacts from this level included 90 ceramics and 13 projectile points. The final level was from
90–105 cm and ended at Floor 2. The entire level was Zone C refuse deposits and a thin layer of
sand and what may have been roof fall. Artifacts from this level included 128 ceramics and 18
projectile points.
LCAS Excavation of Pit Structure 1
As noted earlier, the LCAS members encountered two looter pits in Pit Structure 1 and began
their excavations by expanding the two pits towards the walls of the structure (Figure 6.5). Leslie
and his son Mark (seen in several photographs of Pit Structure 1) expanded one of the looter pits
towards the eastern wall, discovering that the natural Zone A sediments covered a concentrated
deposit of refuse against the eastern wall. The trash deposit was designated Zone C, and a small
section was excavated to a depth of a little over one meter, at which point they encountered a
compacted floor. In order to obtain a stratified sequence of artifacts, they then excavated a 5 foot
by 5 foot (1.5 by 1.5 m) area (here referred to as Unit C-2) in 6 inch (15 cm) levels to the floor
(Figure 6.6). The remainder of the refuse deposit of Zone C was then excavated as a single zone.

smooth, compacted surface of the upper floor (Floor 2) is visible and a collection of bone fragments
collected from the Zone C refuse deposit can be seen at the lower right.

The LCAS excavations in Pit Structure 1 proceeded without incident over the course of five
weekends. A substantial portion of the upper fill deposits of Zones A, B, C, D, and E from the
surface to Floor 2 were systematically excavated, including most of the center and eastern wall of
the structure. The area along the northern wall had been excavated as a general unit. Leslie notes
that backdirt was screened outside of the rooms (several pictures confirm this) and that the
excavated areas were cleared and left clean of excavation dirt and debris.
Upon returning to the site, Leslie and the LCAS crew found that looters had struck again. Fill
deposits along the southern and western walls (and probably parts of the walls) had been
excavated and mined for collectible artifacts. The LCAS excavation surfaces and structure
interior were covered by screened backdirt left by the looters. As noted previously, the looters
followed the artifact-rich refuse deposits of Zones B, C, and E into the side walls of the
excavations, undermining the overlying natural Zone A deposits. The entire southern and
western sections of the Zone A deposits then collapsed in large sections into the room. The two
upper panels of Figure 6.7 (see also Figure 6.3) show some of the results of the looting event.
Leslie examined the backdirt and noted that it was full of animal bone, chipped stone, and small
ceramics, confirming that the deposits had been mined for the projectile points, large painted
sherds, and other “goodies.” The collapsed Zone A sections contained very little cultural material
and were shoveled out of the room.

of controlled LCAS excavations; lower left, deep looter pit in fill; lower right, removing looted deposits
(Leslie’s photo log entry reads “oteenth and last time to shovel out Room 1”).

The looting event was cause for a change in methods. Fearing that future controlled excavations
could be compromised or destroyed during any absence from the site, Leslie and the crew decided
to excavate only small areas of deposits and to leave some amounts of backdirt in the room in an
attempt to thwart future looting efforts, or at least to delay and reduce the extent of the damage
caused by looting. The strategy was somewhat successful, as Leslie noted that subsequent looting
episodes were restricted to small areas of the fill.
The remaining portion of Zone C had not been disturbed because it was covered by a layer of
backdirt. The LCAS crew removed the backdirt and finished excavating Zone C and completed
excavation of the last section of the fill remaining against the northern wall. They decided to no
longer separate the fill from this area by zone and provenienced the artifacts as “upper fill” or
“upper floor.” The manuscript does not specify which zones were assigned to the two categories,
although it would be logical to assume that they simply separated artifacts in the fill from those
found on or within a few centimeters of the upper floor.
After removing the overlying refuse deposits of Zone E and Zone C, Floor 2 was described as a
compacted layer of dark reddish brown clay similar to the deposits of Pleistocene-aged clay
exposed below the caliche conglomerate along the flanks of the escarpment. The floor was
cleaned and examined for subfloor features. Figure 6.8 shows the floor and a schematic of the
various fill excavations (e.g., controlled excavations in zones, looted deposits). Two floor hearths
were recorded along the central east-west axis of the room, each approximately one meter from
the eastern and western walls. The eastern hearth was intact and consisted of a ring of caliche

156

Chapter Six

slabs or cobbles with an exterior diameter measuring 40 cm and an interior pit measuring 25 cm
in diameter. A dark layer of soil was present on the interior at floor level. The western hearth
retained only a small arc of rocks with the remainder scattered across the floor. It had a similar
construction to the eastern hearth but with a slightly larger pit of 33 cm. Each hearth was
positioned atop the floor and the pits did not penetrate below the floor. A suspected entry ramp
extended from the southeastern corner.
Two circular posthole stains were found approximately 60 cm from the northwestern and
northeastern corners, each measuring approximately 20 cm in diameter. During later excavations
of the underlying fill and Floor 1, examination of the underlying fill discovered a third posthole in
the southwest corner and found that the holes extended from 25 to 36 cm deep. The size and
depth of the postholes in Pit Structure 1 correspond to that of primary roof support posts in
Jornada pueblos (Miller and Graves 2009).
Upon completion of Floor 2, Leslie and the crew believed that the excavation of the room was
complete and that all the floor features had been excavated. They planned to return to the site and
Pit Structure 1 a final time, clean the floor and walls, and complete a thorough photographic
documentation of the structure. All of the screened backdirt piled around the sides of Pit
Structure 1 was then dumped over the escarpment to the south.
The Second Period of Excavation and the Lower Floor: Again, however, the looters struck
during their absence. Upon returning to the site in 1963, Leslie found that looters had continued
digging in the structure and had penetrated through the upper floor, revealing additional deposits
and another floor surface below. The structure was filled with screened dirt, and most of the
walls had been destroyed by the looters who apparently did not recognize the walls or limits of
the structure. Examination of the looter pits dug through parts of the northern and southern fills
157

The Merchant Site

and floors noted that a floor was present 60 cm below Floor 2 and separated by a layer of roof fall
and trash from the first floor.
The fill deposits between the two floors were designated as Zone G and Zone H and were
excavated over the course of several weekend sessions. Aside from the looter pits, most of the
fill deposits comprising these zones was systematically excavated and screened. Zone G was
mostly natural sediments, and Zone H consisted of floor fill. Most of Floor 1 was intact and
documented (Figure 6.9).
Floor 1 was described as a compacted layer of fine caliche mixed with reddish brown clay that
formed a very hard layer when moistened. Figure 6.10 shows the floor and a schematic of the
various fill excavations. A single floor hearth was present along the central east-west axis about
60 cm from the western wall. The hearth was constructed in the same manner as the two hearths
in Floor 2, with a ring of caliche cobbles measuring 45 cm on the outside with an interior pit
measuring 30 cm diameter. A small layer of ash and burned soil was present on the interior. A
primary posthole measuring 30 cm in diameter and 28 cm deep was present in the center of the
floor. A sloping entry ramp extended from the southeastern corner but was not excavated. Three
exterior postholes were found in disturbed contexts outside the limits of the floor.

1.

The Dimensions of Structure 1 based on the LCAS Excavations: Pit Structure 1 appears to have
been square in shape. The size, depth, and floor area of the structure are difficult to determine.
Looting events destroyed portions of the walls in the 1960s, and the following 50 years of erosion
further destroyed any sections of walls that remained intact. Leslie notes that most of the walls
were disturbed by looters at various times during the four years the structure remained open, and
Leslie included very few details on the construction and attributes of the walls in his manuscript.
As a result of these problems, Leslie calculated the room dimensions on the basis on the exposed
floor surfaces. Floor 2 (the upper floor) measured 4.9 m (16 feet) north-south and 5.5 m (18 feet)
east-west for a floor area of 26.9 square meters. The dimensions of the lower floor (Floor 1) were
approximately the same as the upper floor, although Leslie’s plan map shows the north-south
length at approximately 5.8 m (19 feet). Floor 2 was 1.52 m below the surface and Floor 1 was
the deepest part of the structure at 1.83 m.

2015 Excavation of Pit Structure 1
Pit structure 1 had been left as an open excavation since the final fieldwork was completed in
1964. Leslie visited the site several times over the following two decades and took pictures of
certain excavation areas. The photograph in the upper panel of Figure 6.11 shows how the open
structure appeared in 1976, twelve years after the LCAS excavations. The lower panel shows the
structure after another 38 years had elapsed. The effects of five decades of exposure and erosion
can be appraised by comparing the two photos. The ring of backdirt left around the structure had
leveled a bit and spread out horizontally and it appeared that some amount had backwashed into
the structure. The amount of vegetation, consisting mostly of creosote, had increased and the
creosote bushes had grown in size and stature. The contours of the upper levels of the exposed
caliche sides of the excavation unit walls were smoothed by erosion and fragments of caliche had
eroded into the exposed excavation along with backdirt.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Archaeologists with the BLM Carlsbad Field Office visited the site in 2012. The intent of the
visit was to inspect and evaluate the condition of the site, as well as to collect radiocarbon and
subsistence samples as part of Permian Basin MOA Task Order 10 (see Scott Cummings and
Kováčik 2013:65). A small shovel test was placed along the western side of the backdirt ring and
artifact and organic samples were collected. A radiocarbon age estimate was obtained from a
sample of mesquite wood charcoal, providing the first absolute chronometric age estimate for the
Merchant site (see Chapter Nine).
Versar returned to the Merchant site in 2015 and began remedial excavations in Pit Structure 1.
The first step was to remove the dense vegetation growing inside the open excavation and across
the ring of backdirt (Figure 6.12). After the vegetation was cleared, a 2-m by 2 -m collection and
excavation grid was established and tied to the UTM coordinates of Speth’s 1984 datum. The
vegetation removal also allowed the dimensions of the backdirt ring and depth of the excavation
to be estimated. The cleared backdirt ring measured approximately 18 m by 18 m. Subtracting
the 124 square meter LCAS excavation unit, the backdirt ring covered an area of approximately
200 square meters. The mounds ranged in height from 17 to 30 cm above the original ground
surface with most of the mounds measuring around 30 cm. Based on the depth and size, it is
estimated that the backdirt ring consisted of 30.5 cubic meters of screened fill deposits from the
LCAS and looter excavations. The open excavation area measured 11.2 by 11.0 m and at its
deepest point was 1.63 m below the ground surface.
Surface Collection and Excavation of the Ring of Backdirt
Surface collections were conducted over the entire backdirt mound and open excavation area
within 53 2 m by 2 m units. Of the five units lacking artifacts, four were inside the structure in
areas buried by recent eolian sediments. The 48 positive units yielded a total of 1,865 artifacts
for an average density of 9.7 items per square meter. The artifact total included 1,415 bone
fragments, 214 chipped stone and 7 projectile points, 123 ceramic sherds, and 106 ground or
battered stone items. The surface artifact densities were quite high and established that the
screened backdirt contained substantial quantities of artifacts and very large numbers of animal
bones. The quantity of bone material recovered from the surface was unanticipated.
Upon completion of the surface collection, the next task was to excavate and screen the ring of
LCAS and looter backdirt surrounding the structure. The initial strategy was to excavate the ring
of backdirt in four quadrants along the southern, northern, eastern, and western sides of the open
excavation. Removal of one quadrant would also provide a space to screen the sediments from
the interior of the structure. A 1 m by 7 m unit was placed across the width of the southern side
of the backdirt ring (Figure 6.13). At the northern end of the unit, another 1 m by 5 m unit was
established to cross the eastern side of the ring. These units would provide the first exposure of
the southeastern quadrant. Since the deposits had been thoroughly mixed and disturbed during
the various excavations of the 1960s, there was no need to maintain vertical provenience and the
deposits were excavated and screened as a single level to the sterile substrate. Approximately
half of the fill was screened using ⅛-inch mesh screen and half through ¼-inch mesh.
The backdirt deposit was a homogenous layer of dark brown sandy loam with varying quantities
of natural caliche gravels. A brown sandy loam of intact prehistoric deposits was encountered
below the backdirt near the eastern edge of the unit. The maximum depth ranged from 22 to
30 cm (Figure 6.14).

deposits.

Figure 6.14. Profile of the southern quadrant of backdirt exposed in the excavation trench.

In addition to the 1,865 items collected from the total surface, an exceptionally high number of
5,141 artifacts was recovered from the sample excavation of the deposit. The counts include
3,739 bone fragments, 1,082 chipped stone items, 16 projectile points, 54 ground or battered
stone items, 243 sherds, and 7 miscellaneous objects. The ceramics were mostly Ochoa varieties,
but a small number of decorated sherds (and the projectile points) had been overlooked by the
looters and LCAS. Miscellaneous artifacts include five polishing stones, two fragments of
freshwater shell, a piece of what looked like plaster, and a modern shotgun shell.
A total of 14.3 square meters was excavated and 2.37 cubic meters of fill was screened evenly
using ¼- and ⅛-inch mesh. Based on these values, artifact densities in the backdirt are calculated
as 592 artifacts and 1,578 bone items per cubic meter. The overall size of the backdirt ring is
estimated at 123 square meters with an average depth of 17 cm. Based on these estimates, the
backdirt mound of Pit Structure 1 consists of 30.5 cubic meters of screened fill and at least 18,056
artifacts and 48,000 fragments of animal bone are contained within the deposit.
The statement of work for the Merchant site remediation stipulated that all screened backdirt from
the 1960 excavations located around and inside Pit Structures 1 and 2 was to be re-screened.
Based on the results of the initial work in the backdirt deposits of Pit Structure 1, it was
immediately apparent that this would be unrealistic given the labor and curation costs required to
deal with so many artifacts. Consultation with the CFO resolved that the sample of the two units
in the southeastern quadrant constituted a sufficient and representative sample of materials in the
backdirt and further excavations were unwarranted. Moreover, based on the recovery rates from
the exterior backdirt deposits, it was certain that similar quantities would be recovered during
excavation of the interior deposits.

Excavation of the Interior Backdirt Deposits
Excavation of the backdirt deposits within the open excavation of Pit Structure 1 began with a
single 1 m by 7 m north-south hand trench traversing the eastern half of the structure. The
interior unit was positioned so that, when linked with the southern backdirt unit, the two units
would provide a continuous profile of backdirt and interior. The trench was excavated in two
natural levels, and materials were provenienced to 1 m by 1 m subunits. The two natural levels
consisted of a 30 to 40 cm thick upper layer of laminated eolian sands and a lower level
consisting of 20 to 30 cm dark sandy loam that extended to the floor (Figure 6.15). The depth of
at least 70 cm was unanticipated, and as with the exterior backdirt mounds, the interior fill
contained exceptionally high artifact counts. Several banded layers of sediment were observed in
the two deposits when moist, indicating that the backwashed fill had been deposited over the
course of many erosional episodes. As with the exterior backdirt mounds, the interior deposits
were thoroughly mixed and redeposited and, despite the natural stratigraphy created by the
episodic infilling of the structure, none of the artifacts were in primary stratigraphic context. The
remaining deposits were excavated in a single arbitrary level.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

A second trench was excavated across the east-west axis of the structure, revealing a similar
series of deposits to depths reaching 82 cm below the interior surface. The two trenches revealed
the general stratigraphy of the interior deposits. Figure 6.16 best illustrates these strata.
Excluding the cultural strata associated with the floor and subfloor levels, three primary strata
were observed in the fill. Above the sloping caliche conglomerate bedrock around the margins of
the interior floor area was a deposit of grayish dark brown sandy loam. Large quantities of
caliche gravels and nodules were present throughout the stratum, as were several large cobbles
and boulder-sized fragments of caliche that had fallen from the exposed caliche conglomerate
surrounding the interior.

the upper two strata of dark sandy loam and the lowermost laminated layers resulting from episodic infilling
of the interior.

Intermixed with the gravelly loam at the edges and forming the upper 15 to 45 cm of the interior
fill was a layer of light brown to brown eolian sand. The stratum had multiple laminations
consisting of alternating layers of grayish and brown sands. Small amounts of caliche pebbles
and a few cobbles were present in the deposits but in much lower quantities than observed in the
gravelly stratum around the margins of the excavation area. Beneath the laminated eolian stratum
and mostly restricted to what appeared to be the original floor area of the pit structure was a 20to 30-cm thick deposit of gray-brown sandy loam that become increasingly compact near the
floor. The lowermost part of the stratum was dark clay above the floor.
Modern artifacts from the late 1950s and early 1960s were recovered throughout all three strata.
The artifacts included metal soda cans, .22 and .30 caliber cartridges, canned meat tins, metal
crown tops, bottle glass, and fragments of milled wood. A few modern aluminum beer cans were
165

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

found in the upper levels, suggesting that the site continued to be visited (and perhaps looted) for
years after the LCAS excavations. Of course, the most significant aspect of the modern materials
is that their presence confirmed that all three major strata were of modern origin.
The nature and relative positions of the stratigraphic layers recorded in the two trenches (Figure
6.17) determined that the lowermost and central part of the structure was filled with organic-rich
backdirt. It is possible that the floor and lower level of the exposed pit structure was backfilled
by the LCAS using screened fill deposits, forming the lowermost stratum observed during the
2015 excavations. It is also possible that the deposit consists of screened deposits left by looters
who continued to dig the exposed excavation after the LCAS had departed. However, Leslie does
not mention any backfilling, nor does he mention that looters continued to visit the structure.
Thus the origin of the lowermost stratum remains conjectural. Regardless, it clearly formed
during the early stages of backfilling after the end of the LCAS excavations.
Over the following four or five decades, the open excavation was filled with numerous layers of
eolian and eroded backdirt deposits reaching depths of up to 82 cm. Fine-grained sediments
tended to accumulate in the center, forming the laminated deposits, while the gravelly deposits
around the margins were formed through erosion of the surrounding backdirt mounds and caliche
conglomerate unit walls. Some degree of bioturbation by animal burrows had also taken place.

Structure 1.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Despite the history of excavation and looting and natural disturbances, an intact plastered floor
and several floor features were revealed in the exploratory trench excavations (Figure 6.18). The
floor consisted of compacted clay around 5 mm thick with a caliche-plastered surface. A
complete bifacial mano was found on the floor against one of the floor features. The presence of
such a collectible artifact verified that the floor and its features were intact, since Leslie and the
LCAS crews documented and collected any whole groundstone tools found on room floors.

Figure 6.18. View of the floor and floor features when first exposed: upper left, plastered floor and floor
features below layer of backwashed fill and caliche debris; upper right, two subfloor pits; lower left, bifacial
mano resting on plastered floor; lower right, compacted floor with remnants of caliche plaster.

After documenting the two exploratory trenches the remainder of backdirt fill was excavated to
expose the entire floor surface. Thirty-four 1 m by 1 m units were excavated to the floor or along
the caliche conglomerate bedrock exposures around the margins of the floor. All were removed
in a single arbitrary level and screened through ¼-inch mesh with a 10 percent sample screened
through ⅛-inch mesh. The floor appeared to be mostly intact in the western half of the structure
but the eastern half lacked a plastered surface. The final excavation consisted of removing the 0.5
to 3 m of floor matrix and some plaster to help define floor features. A total of 14 floor features
were defined and excavated partially or in their entirety.
As documented elsewhere in midden and backdirt deposits, the material culture densities inside
Pit Structure 1 were exceptionally high, and, again, the nature of the assemblages reflected the
fact that the deposits had been screened and selectively collected for projectile points and other
prominent artifacts. The artifact counts included 2,354 chipped stone items and 51 projectile
points, 15,296 bone fragments, 1,298 ceramic sherds, and 174 ground or battered stones. A
167

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

volume of 18.8 cubic meters of backdirt sediment was screened. Based on these values, artifact
densities in the backdirt are calculated as 206 artifacts and 814 bone items per cubic meter. The
artifact densities are even more significant considering that the deposits had already been
screened by the LCAS and various looters.
The Lower Floor and Subfloor Features of Pit Structure 1
The completed excavation of the fill and exposed floor surface of Pit Structure 1 is shown in
Figure 6.19. Unfortunately parts of the floor were saturated by water ponded in the depression
from a rainstorm that passed over the site the previous evening, but remnants of a plastered floor
surface can be seen. Also visible in this and following images is the surrounding caliche
conglomerate stratum forming the boundaries of the LCAS excavation unit. The damage and
pitting caused by the looter excavations is clearly evident in the photographs of the cleared and
cleaned excavation unit.

Figure 6.19. View of the completed 2015 excavations in Pit Structure 1 showing some of the defined wall
margins and remnants of plastered floor (dark grey areas). View faces towards the east.

The combined effects of looting and the attempts by the LCAS excavators to trace the walls and
floor have compromised much of the integrity of those architectural attributes. Careful cleaning
and examination of the contact areas between the floor surface and surrounding conglomerate
were able to delineate segments of what was probably the original extent of the floor (Figure
6.20). In the view towards the west in the upper panel of the figure, a remnant of the southern
edge of the floor can be seen against the caliche at the right center of the photograph. A similar
boundary between floor and caliche can be seen along the northern side of the unit in the lower
panel.

The lower floor surface is used to estimate the dimensions of the structure as measuring 4.56 m
north-south by 4.48 m east-west. These are more than a meter smaller than Leslie’s
measurements of 5.8 m by 5.5 m. Based on the measurements from the 2015 excavations, the
floor area is 20.4 square meters as opposed to Leslie’s area of 31.9 square meters. It is difficult to
determine the actual size of the pit structure, but we feel that the 2015 measurements are more
realistic given that the caliche conglomerate “walls” surrounding the floors were mostly
destroyed by looters and occasionally by the LCAS excavators. A rock-lined floor hearth was
found where Leslie had identified an entry, indicating that the floor extended a bit farther to the
southeast.
The shape of the structure has proven difficult to reconstruct. The apparent square shape (and
larger dimensions) seen in the aerial view of the open LCAS excavation (see Figure 6.13) as
defined by the caliche conglomerate is misleading. Only the segments of the uppermost caliche
surface surrounding the open excavation retained what appears to be a square shape. As
illustrated in Figure 6.21, below the uppermost level the caliche conglomerate was a very
irregular and sloping surface to the depth of the floor.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Because of the extensive damage from looters around the interior perimeter of the room, only
small portions of the junction of the lower floor and walls could be identified during the 2015
excavations, and it is not possible to determine if the structure was round or square in shape based
on those excavations. Leslie’s planviews and manuscript describe the structure as square in
shape, and in later conversations with John Speth he claimed that the apparent round
configuration was an artificial creation resulting from the extensive damage to walls and interior
surfaces by the looters (John Speth, personal communication 2016). We note that Leslie had a
good eye for strata and features and paid attention to the detail of his excavations. While our
excavation data cannot confirm or deny his statements regarding the shape of Pit Structure 1, we
also have no reason or evidence to disregard his documentation and interpretations.
The depth of the floor is 1.57 m below the upper caliche surface. Given that an additional 10 to
20 cm of topsoil was present over the structure, the total depth of 1.67 to 1.77 meters is close to
Leslie’s reported depth of 1.83 m for Floor 1. The floor was partially plastered with a mix of clay
and caliche daub across the western half of the structure. The upper plastered surface was
missing in the eastern half and may have been removed during the LCAS excavations. The
nature of the walls could not be determined since the entire periphery of caliche conglomerate
was pitted by looters. Based on the few non-pitted, areas it is surmised that the walls were
probably straight-sided.
Floor Features: Fourteen floor features were exposed during the clearance of the floor (Figure
6.22). All were either bisected or completely excavated. The architectural and cultural features
included two floor hearths (Feature 1.2 and Feature 1.4), one pit (Feature 1.3), two ash pits
(Feature 1.6 and Feature 1.9), and six postholes (Features 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.10, and 1.14).
Natural features included two fill lenses or slight depressions below the floor (Feature 1.11 and
1.13) and one irregular pit that was probably a rodent burrow (Feature 1.12). The attributes of the
floor features are described in Table 6.2.
The floor features were clearly associated with the occupation of the lower floor (Floor 1). Most
of the features contained artifacts in the fill, including an intact mano in Feature 1.3. Numerous
plant remains and pollen remains were identified in subsistence samples from the fills. The
features are described below.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Feature 1.1: Feature 1.1 was a posthole in the southeast quadrant of Pit Structure 1. The fill
consisted of a dark gray brown sandy loam with scattered charcoal (Figure 6.23).
Feature 1.2: Feature 1.2 was a small floor hearth located 1 m north of the southern wall with a
slight remnant of an adobe collar. The hearth measured 40 cm by 45 cm and was 8 cm below the
floor (Figure 6.24). The fill consisted of a dark brown sandy loam with charcoal chunks. Two
small burned bone fragments were recovered.
Feature 1.3: Feature 1.3 was a large and relatively deep storage pit in the east-central part of the
room. The western margin was difficult to discern due to rodent activity and having been cut
through by looters or LCAS excavators. The intact portion measured 1.11 m by 0.82 m and was
0.23 m deep (Figure 6.25). The fill consisted of a gray ashy loam with some charcoal with a
dense layer of charcoal at the base. The feature contained 13 flakes, 45 bone fragments, a
complete bifacial mano, and 28 fire-cracked rock fragments weighing 7 kg. The macrobotanical
samples yielded two Zea mays cupules, nine Prosopis sp. seed fragments, and one Yucca sp. seed
all of which were charred. Maize, sunflower, and Liliaceae family pollen was found the soil
sample collected from the base of the pit below the mano.
Feature 1.4: Feature 1.4 was a large floor hearth located against the southern wall. The feature
was surrounded by an ash dump (Feature 1.9). The hearth measured 96 cm by 54 cm and 19 cm
deep and contained a large quantity of fire-cracked rock throughout the fill and around the sides.
The fill was a dark gray to black charcoal-stained sandy loam with a high density of charcoal
(Figure 6.26). The margins of the pit were lined with clay that was oxidized. Zea mays
cupule/cob fragments and Prosopis sp. seed fragments were identified in the flotation sample.

Feature 1.5: Feature 1.5 was a secondary post hole or socket adjacent to another post socket
(Feature 1.7) in the northeast corner. The feature measured 36 cm by 26 cm and extended 11 cm
below the floor. The feature had several large cobbles and a fire-cracked rock fragment that were
probably used as shims for the roof support post. The consisted of a dark brown charcoal-stained
sandy loam. A single polishing stone was found in the upper fill. Four Prosopis sp. seed
fragments were found in the flotation sample.
Feature 1.6: Feature 1.6 was a circular ash deposit that was clearly visible in the southeast
quadrant of the structure (Figure 6.27). It measured 89 cm in diameter and was only 6 cm deep.
The fill consisted of a dark brown to black charcoal-stained sandy loam with charcoal chunks.
Bone fragments and an Ochoa Indented sherd were in the fill, and a flotation sample yielded
charred Prosopis sp. seed fragments.
Feature 1.7: Feature 1.7 was a secondary post socket or rodent burrow in the caliche wall of the
northeast corner of the structure. The feature was 25 cm in diameter and extended at 17 cm into
the caliche . The fill consisted of a dark brown sandy loam and four flakes, 38 bone fragments
and 11 gypsum crystals were recovered from the fill.
Feature 1.8: Feature 1.8 was a secondary post socket set into the caliche wall in the southeast
corner of the structure. The feature measured 34 cm by 28 cm wide and extended more than
33 cm into the caliche. The fill consisted of a brown sandy loam. A utilized flake and 2 bone
fragments were in the fill. A Zea mays cupule fragment and two Prosopis sp. seed fragments
were found in the flotation sample.

175

Figure 6.27. Ash pit Feature 1.6 as first exposed in the lower floor.

Feature 1.9: Feature 1.9 was a basin-shaped depression around the margins of floor hearth
Feature 1.4 and appeared to be an ash dump associated with the hearth. It was irregular in shape
and was 1.5 m long and 1.0 wide and 14 cm deep. The fill consisted of a dark brown clay
interspersed with ash lenses. A bone fragment, utilized flake, and 10 small fire-cracked rocks
were in the fill, and two Zea mays cupule fragments and 12 Prosopis sp. seed fragments were
identified in the flotation sample.
Feature 1.10: Feature 1.10 was a circular posthole at the southcentral margin of the floor. The
feature was 22 cm in diameter and extended 15 cm below the floor. The fill consisted of a dark
gray charcoal-stained sandy loam. Cobbles along the walls probably served as shims. Ten bone
fragments were recovered from the fill, and one Zea mays cupule fragments and 13 Prosopis sp.
seed fragments were identified in the flotation sample.
Feature 1.11: Feature 1.11 was an irregular shaped and thin lens of cultural fill below the floor.
It measured 40 cm in diameter and was only 2 cm thick. The fill was a dark brown sandy loam.
No artifacts were found within the fill.
Feature 1.12: Feature 1.12 was an irregular shaped lens or depression against the northcentral
margins of the floor. The fill was a mix of natural and cultural deposits. The undulating base
was from 2 to 23 cm deep and the lens measured a minimum of 76 cm by 46 cm. One metate
fragment and one Ochoa Indented sherd were in the fill. Several unusual plant species, including
honeysuckle, spectacle pod, and cattail, were identified in a pollen sample brushed from the
metate fragment.

176

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Feature 1.13: Feature 1.13 was an irregular shaped lens or depression against the southern wall.
The feature measured 1 m by 0.7 m and had a maximum depth of 10 cm below the floor. The fill
consisted of a dark brown sandy loam with scattered charcoal. Three flakes and a bone fragment
were recovered. Features 1.12 and 1.13 appear to be thin lenses of occupation debris that were
plastered over when the floor was refurbished.
Feature 1.14: Feature 1.14 was a cylindrical posthole against the southwest margin of the floor.
The feature measured 18 cm by 15 cm and extended 12 cm below the floor. The fill consisted of
a dark gray brown charcoal-stained sandy loam. Cobbles set along the interior walls were
probably shims to stabilize the support post. No artifacts were recovered from the fill of this
feature, but four Prosopis sp. seed fragments were found in the flotation sample.

PIT STRUCTURE 2
Pit Structure 2 was located within Refuse Area B approximately 20 m beyond the eastern edge of
the northern roomblock and a few meters from the two-track road along the eastern margins of
the site. The documentary and photographic records for Pit Structure 2 are less complete and
extensive than those available for Pit Structure 1. While it was challenging to decipher the
sequence of excavations, looting events, and the strata and features encountered during the
excavation of Pit Structure 1, Pit Structure 2 proved to be even more difficult. Furthermore,
instead of clarifying the nature of the structure, the findings of the 2015 excavations actually
created more problems for evaluation and interpretation.

LCAS Excavation of Pit Structure 2
Leslie and the LCAS had suspected that a structure of some kind existed near the northeastern
margins of Refuse Area B because the looting and artifact mining in that location had
encountered deposits that extended much deeper than other parts of the midden that generally
encountered the caliche bedrock at a depth of 30 cm. Some of the potholes in the area extended
to depths of two feet (60 cm). During one of the field sessions to excavate Pit Structure 1 in the
early 1960s, Leslie noted that the pace of looting had increased around the location and what
appeared to be walls had been exposed along the eastern and southern sides. As often happened,
the screened backdirt had been piled around and inside the structure. Leslie and the crew decided
to explore the newly disturbed areas and spent two days in 1960 excavating a portion of the fill
and interior features.
The LCAS crew first cleared and screened the looter backdirt in and around the looter pit, noting
that only bone slivers and sherds were recovered. Following the edge of a suspected wall
exposed by the looters, they traced the walls by removing the overlying backdirt and
approximately 30 cm of soils and midden deposits down to the caliche conglomerate (Figure
6.28).
By exposing the upper caliche surface and the “walls” formed by the conglomerate bedrock, the
outlines of the structure were revealed. Looters had dug through the southern part of the structure
and uppermost floor surface (Figure 6.29). The western walls were disturbed by looting and
some wall segments had collapsed into the fill, but much of the eastern wall remained relatively
intact. At this point, the structure measured 3.66 m north-south by 2.44 m east-west. The eastern
wall extended another 1.83 m to form a 1.07-m wide feature that was thought to be an
antechamber or entryway. Further excavation of this feature found it was a ramped entry that
sloped from a few centimeters below the caliche to a point 30 cm above the lower of two floors in
the structure. A relatively intact corner was noted in the entry (Figure 6.30).

Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Figure 6.30. Corner of caliche conglomerate wall in the entryway.

The stratigraphy of the upper fill of the structure was difficult to define due to disturbances from
the uncontrolled excavations across Refuse Area B, but some basic stratigraphic zones were
described. The stratum above the structure consisted of midden deposits similar those found
throughout Refuse Area B. These deposits ranged from 30 to 45 cm in depth and extended to the
caliche conglomerate bedrock. The interior fill of the room consisted of a deposit similar to
Zones B and C of Pit Structure 1. The fill was a mix of eolian and clay sediments with large
numbers of artifacts, animal bone, and pockets of ash or concentrated masses of bone. Burned
caliche rocks were common, as were natural caliche pebbles and gravels eroded from the
surrounding conglomerate.
A deposit similar to Zone C-2 of Pit Structure 1 was present in the northern entryway fill of Pit
Structure 2. The deposit had fewer artifacts but contained several dense ash deposits, one of
which also contained charred acorns. Leslie notes that the four contexts having charred acorns
were associated with dense white ash that appeared to be the contents of emptied firepits. The
southern half of the entryway fill had dense concentrations of animal bone within a fine grayish
brown fill that was similar to Zone E of Pit Structure 1.
A section of the caliche conglomerate forming the western “wall” had broken off and was found
within the upper fill. The caliche boulder was encountered in a small unit and was initially
thought to be bedrock, but further excavation determined it was a fragment of the surrounding
conglomerate. Around 8 cm below the boulder a floor was encountered (Figure 6.31).

Figure 6.31. Filtered and enhanced version of Leslie’s underexposed slide E4_134. The upper floor of Pit
Structure 2 is shown (facing northwest), including the caliche conglomerate “boulder” wall segment found
resting a few centimeters above the floor. A collared floor hearth or primary posthole can be seen to the right
of the boulder.

The floor was a surface of dark red clay positioned approximately 107 cm below the ground
surface. Approximately 30 percent of the floor in the southern part of the room had been
destroyed by looting, but the remainder was intact. Leslie states that the floor was not examined
for the presence of interior postholes or floor features. Our review of the photographic record
discovered that a collared floor hearth or primary posthole is clearly visible in an enhanced (slide)
photograph of the floor (see Figure 6.31). In his SW Federation article, Leslie (1965a:27)
mentions that hearths were present in both of the “pit rooms” but no further information on the
provenience of the hearths is provided.
The LCAS crew removed more of the overburden deposits around the edges of the structure,
revealing several exterior postholes in the caliche conglomerate (Figure 6.32). Six postholes
were present around 30 cm from the wall edges on the eastern, western, and southern walls. The
postholes averaged 20 cm in diameter and had been cut 25 to 30 cm deep into the caliche.
After clearing the floor surface, Leslie did no more work in Pit Structure 2, devoting his attention
to Structure 1 and the domestic rooms. The room remained open for the next four or five years
until the spring of 1964 or 19652 when two unnamed people dug through the floor and screened
additional fill deposits found below the floor. Leslie obtained two bags of bones and artifacts but
very little of the artifact content could be described. He also obtained a basic description of the
2

Leslie’s manuscript states that the excavation of the lower fill and floor took place in 1965 but his figure
includes the statement “Excavated 1964” within those lower strata.

floor and fill associated with the earlier occupation of the structure that he included in his crosssection maps (see Figure 6.32). According to the excavators, the floor was a surface of hard,
smooth caliche encountered around 1.8 m below the surface. No floor features were described.
The overlying fill was similar to the strata observed above Floor 1 of Pit Structure 1, consisting of
an upper layer of somewhat sterile eolian sand and a lower 30 cm of trash and caliche debris
mixed with the sandy sediments.
The stratigraphic sequence of artifacts and the artifact types from Pit Structure 2 are not as
thoroughly described as for Pit Structure 1. The upper fill and floor contact deposits yielded 57
projectile points, 1,050 ceramic sherds, and a mussel shell pendant. A collection of
miscellaneous chipped and groundstone artifacts is mentioned, as well as quantities of animal
bone, but as happened elsewhere across the site, these artifact classes were not collected in a
systematic manner. Apparently the lower fill and floor was mined for projectile points and other
noteworthy artifacts and Leslie could only report a ceramic count of 900 sherds.
As usual, approximately 95 percent of the ceramic assemblage consisted of Ochoa wares.
However, the non-Ochoa ceramics listed by Leslie are intriguing because several types dating to
the late 1400s and early 1500s are noted. Along with the common Roswell and El Paso
brownwares, Chupadero Black-on-white, and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta were several sherds
of Lincoln Black-on-red and eight sherds identified as varieties of Glaze A. Sherds from distant
sources in western New Mexico and northern Chihuahua, such as Gila and Ramos Polychrome,
were also present. Based on the ceramic dating, it would appear that the fill deposits of Pit
Structure 2 were younger in age than those of Pit Structure 1. This possibility is explored in
greater detail in Chapter Thirteen.

2015 Excavation of Pit Structure 2
As with Pit Structure 1, Pit Structure 2 had been left as an open excavation since the last episode
of fieldwork in 1964 or 1965. The same effects of five decades of exposure and erosion were
visible: the ring of backdirt surrounding the structure had leveled a bit and spread out
horizontally and quite of bit of the backdirt had washed into the interior of the structure.
Versar began remedial excavations in Pit Structure 2 by first removing the dense vegetation
growing inside the open excavation and across the ring of backdirt (Figure 6.33). After the
vegetation was cleared, a 2 m by 2 m collection and excavation grid was established and tied to
the UTM coordinates of Speth’s 1984 datum. The vegetation removal also allowed the
dimensions of the backdirt ring and depth of the excavation area to be estimated. The size of the
cleared backdirt ring was smaller than the one around Pit Structure 1. The largest backdirt
mounds were present on the east and west sides of the open excavation unit and covered
approximately 16 square meters and averaged 5 cm in height. Diagnostic artifacts and tools were
collected, but based on the previous collection of Pit Structure 1, a systematic collection of
artifacts from the surface of the backdirt mounds was considered unnecessary.
No excavations were conducted in the backdirt mounds surrounding the structure. Excavation of
Pit Structure 1 had demonstrated that the interior fill was derived from the surrounding backdirt,
and excavation and collection of the interior fill would provide a substantial and representative
sample of artifacts and bone.

conglomerate “boulder” found near the upper floor during the 1960 excavation remains intact.

Excavation of the Interior Backdirt Deposits
Excavation of the backdirt deposits within the open excavation of Pit Structure 2 began with a
1 m by 7 m north-south hand trench that crossed from the southwest to northeast corner (Figure
6.34). As the excavation proceeded and the underlying sediments and contours of the floor and
walls were defined, the excavation of certain subunits was discontinued upon encountering
surfaces of caliche conglomerate. Excavations began in the northern three 1 m by 1 m subunits in
an attempt to find the floor encountered by the LCAS. A wall area was found, and accordingly
the southern subunits were excavated, revealing a wall on the other side. Having defined the
walls on two sides, another series of units was opened towards the southern wall. The two
adjacent trenches defined the major wall areas originally cleared by Leslie and the LCAS, as well
as tracing the underlying conglomerate bedrock. No remnants of either the upper or lower floors
described by Leslie were identified in the severely disturbed structure.

Figure 6.34. View of excavation trench in Pit Structure 2 facing south. Note the caliche debris throughout
the fill and the deep excavation at the southwest corner.

The interior stratigraphy and fill deposits were similar to those of Pit Structure 1. Profiles show a
primary stratum of dark brown sandy loam with charcoal and moderate densities of caliche
gravels overlying a layer of laminated light tan to brown sandy loam (Figure 6.35). Gravels and
cobbles eroded from the surrounding caliche conglomerate were present around the sides of the
interior fill. The base of the trench and conglomerate bedrock surface was highly uneven. No
floor surface could be seen in the profiles, but a basin-shaped depression with a possible subfloor
pit was observed in the western profile. Another noteworthy aspect is that the southwestern
corner of the unit extended more than a meter below the bedrock across the room.
All units were excavated as a single cultural level to culturally sterile sediments. The deposits
were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh, with an approximate 10 percent sample of each subunit
screened through ⅛-inch mesh. As noted in other refuse deposits, numerous small tertiary
thinning flakes were recovered during the fine screening. A total of 5 square meters were
excavated to expose the remnants of walls and lower surfaces of the structure and a volume of 3.4
cubic meters of fill was screened.

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

Figure 6.35. Profiles of the west and east walls of the excavation trench across Pit Structure 2.

The material culture densities inside Pit Structure 2 were not as high as those observed for Pit
Structure 1 and other refuse areas, but relatively high numbers were recovered. The nature of the
assemblage, such as the low projectile point numbers, reflect the fact that the deposits had been
screened and selectively collected for projectile points and other prominent artifacts. The artifact
counts included 128 chipped stone items and 6 projectile points, 448 bone fragments, 66 ceramic
sherds, and 8 ground or battered stones. A volume of 3.4 cubic meters of backdirt sediment was
screened. Based on these values, artifact densities in the backdirt are calculated as 61 artifacts
and 132 bone items per cubic meter. The artifact densities are even more significant considering
that the deposits had already been screened by the LCAS and various looters. A total of 110 firecracked rock pieces were recorded. Numerous modern artifacts, including metal soda cans and
containers, nails, wire, and other objects were found throughout the deposits (Figure 6.36),
verifying that the interior fill was modern backdirt from the surrounding mounds.

No remnants of the two floor surfaces described by Leslie and the LCAS excavators were found.
The upper floor had been entirely removed by the two unnamed 1964 or 1965 excavators. If a
lower surface existed, it had also been destroyed, leaving an uneven and pitted caliche bedrock
surface. While the actual upper floor surface was missing, the remnant of a possible floor feature
was defined in the 2015 excavation trench.
Feature 2.1: The remnants of a possible subfloor feature were exposed at a depth of 105 cm
below the surface in the trench in the northwestern quadrant of the pit structure. Feature 2.1 was
shallow basin-shaped surface measuring 66 cm in diameter and 14 cm in depth. The fill consisted
of a dark brown sandy loam with scattered charcoal and some gravel inclusions. No artifacts
were present, but a charcoal sample was collected from the fill.
The charcoal sample yielded a 2-sigma calibrated age of A.D. 1660–1950 (see Chapter Nine).
This age estimate postdates the occupation of Pit Structure 2 as inferred from ceramics, projectile
points, and the surrounding settlement by at least two centuries and up to as many as five
centuries. Feature 2.1 was a remnant of an undetermined floor feature that had been mostly
destroyed along with the floor of Pit Structure 2 and had subsequently in-filled with backdirt and
modern debris. It is possible that the charcoal was redeposited by looters.
Deep Deposits in the Southwestern Corner
In the introduction to his discussion of Pit Structure 2, Leslie makes a passing statement about
their decision to explore the deep midden deposits in Refuse Area B: “…so we spent the next
two days trying to establish if this was a room or just a fault in the caliche trash filled (sic).”
As noted above, a deep pit was encountered in the southwestern corner of Pit Structure 2. The pit
extended far below the elevations where the LCAS excavators had reported floor surfaces. The
pit was filled with multiple layers of natural fine-grained and coarse-grained sediments (Figure
6.37). Modern artifacts were found throughout the layers, establishing that the entire fill
sequence was modern in origin. A Grape Nehi soda can was found at a depth of 1.1 m below the
interior fill surface (see Figure 6.36), and a modern milled lumber 2x4 beam was found at the
bottom of the pit at the rather astonishing depths of 1.6 m below the interior fill surface and 2.2 m
(nearly 7 feet) below the original ground surface.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

There are two explanations for the nature of the fissure, neither of which is completely satisfying.
The pit may be a natural fissure in the caliche conglomerate. Such natural fissures, or “pipes,”
are a common feature of karst landforms such as the caliche and caliche conglomerate
geomorphological units across southeastern New Mexico and west Texas. A similar trash-filled
pipe was identified in a backhoe trench at LA 99437 (Heilen and Murrell 2015:69-72) where a
natural pipe more than a meter in depth had been used as a storage feature. Leslie’s comment
regarding the possibility that the deep refuse in Area B was a trash-filled “fault” in the caliche
suggests that he had encountered such features somewhere else in southeastern New Mexico.
Another explanation is that the deep pit was a storage pit that was mostly destroyed by the looters
who dug through the southern part of Pit Structure 2. It is possible that the looters followed an
artifact-rich deposit deep into the substrate, destroying the subfloor storage pit in the process and
leaving an irregular and deep hole through the caliche.
Both explanations have some plausibility based on the fact that, while searching for “goodies and
pretty items,” looters at the Merchant site followed artifact-rich deposits wherever they went—
underneath and undermining sterile overburden layers, through and below walls, and even into
the caliche bedrock. The looters of Pit Structure 2 followed something to a depth of nearly 7 feet
below the surface and afterwards left a 2x4 wood beam at the base of the pit.
There is no mention of the pit in Leslie’s paper or draft manuscript. It is somewhat puzzling how
this feature escaped his detection. He surely would have noticed such a deep pit during the LCAS
excavations of 1964–1965 or during one of his many return visits to the site between 1965 and
1984. The laminated sediments and modern artifacts in the fill offer some clues. The darker
coarse-grained sediments with small caliche gravels represent relatively high-energy sediments
that may have been deposited during strong rain storms or periods of strong storms. The lighter
fine-grained sediments were probably a combination of eolian and eroded clay sediments. The
presence of modern artifacts suggests that the pit may have been backfilled by the looters or
perhaps an LCAS crew, though it is difficult to imagine how the process of filling the pit with dirt
from the heavily mixed screened backdirt deposits around the structure could have left such
discretely formed strata within the pit.
Pit Structure 2 and the Floor Surfaces
The definition of the dimensions, depth, and architectural attributes of Pit Structure 2 was for the
most part unsuccessful. Most of the walls, the floor surfaces, and even the subfloor basal
substrate had been severely disturbed by looters, and whatever features had been exposed by
Leslie and the LCAS in the upper fill and floor had been dug through by looters or by a pair of
careless LCAS members in 1964 or 1965. Photographs show that even the dense caliche “walls”
bounding the structure were full of holes and pits dug by looters. Whatever lower floor had been
encountered by the unnamed excavators was also mostly gone. Interpretation of the archeological
and architectural data is further confounded by the A.D. 1660–1950 radiocarbon age estimate
from the remnant floor feature.
The remnants of the straight eastern wall seen in the LCAS photographs and 2015 exposures
indicate that some form of formal pit structure had been cut through the caliche conglomerate.
The 1960 LCAS excavations established that the structure had a prepared floor and at least one
major floor feature. However, defining the actual shape, dimensions, and floor of the pit structure
has proven to be difficult based on the LCAS documentation, and the 2015 excavations of the
fragmentary remnants of the structure did little to clarify the situation.
Based on the partial caliche “walls” exposed in the 2015 units, the structure measured 3.0 m in
width and up to 3.6 m in length for an approximate floor area of 10.8 square meters. These
dimensions roughly match those reported by Leslie, although he describes a smaller width by
188

Chapter Six
Excavation of Two Pit Structures at the Merchant Site

around 60 cm. The difference in widths is probably due to the extensive disturbance of the walls
and basal surfaces across the western half of the structure.
Because no remnant floor surfaces were identified, it was difficult to reconstruct the positions and
depths of the upper and lower floors from the 2015 excavation data. Furthermore, the depths of
the floors in Leslie’s cross-section of the structure do not match the descriptions in the text.
Based on the scale of the drawings in Figure 6.32, Leslie’s cross-sections place the upper floor at
a depth of around 65–75 cm below the surface, as opposed to the 107 cm depth described in the
text. The lower floor is placed at 180 cm below the surface, a depth that matches that provided
by the unnamed excavators of the lower deposits. Based on these measurements, the fill deposits
between the floors would have been 105 to 115 cm thick.
These measurements do not match the depths recorded during the 2015 excavation. The caliche
boulder described by Leslie remains in situ and was measured. The top was approximately 10 cm
below the caliche surface, and the boulder measured 45–50 cm from top to bottom. If the upper
floor was 7 to 8 cm below the bottom of the boulder and another 20 to 30 cm of Refuse Area B
deposits overlaid the entire structure, we estimate that the upper floor was positioned between 85
and 100 cm below the ground surface. We feel that this estimate falls within an acceptable
measurement error, given that Leslie and the LCAS did not have access to a transit, theodolite,
line levels, and other means of accurately measuring depth and distance. The remnant floor
feature (Feature 2.1) was encountered at a depth of 105 cm below surface, which makes sense
given its position at the base of and extending below the upper floor.
It should also be noted that the depth of the floor below the ground surface (Refuse B deposits)
and the depth below the caliche surface will differ by 20 to 30 cm. The depth of the caliche, with
perhaps a few cm of topsoil, may be a more accurate representation of the prehistoric depths of
the floor surfaces.
While the position of the upper floor can be reconstructed with an acceptable degree of error, the
lower floor presents a different set of problems. According to Leslie’s informants, the depth of
the lower floor was 1.8 m below the surface. The 2015 excavations across the majority of the
structure interior found very little fill below the upper floor and the uneven caliche conglomerate
bedrock. It is possible that a few centimeters of fill existed between the upper floor and a lower
floor, but we found little evidence to support this or the presence of any remnant of a lower floor.
It simply is not possible that a 30 to 100 cm layer of fill existed below the upper floor and the
caliche bedrock our 2015 excavations found positioned a few centimeters below the floor.
Instead, the 2015 excavations encountered an exceptionally deep excavation in the southeastern
corner of the structure. A modern 2x4 wood beam was encountered at a depth of 1.6 m below the
caliche level and 2.2 m below the ground surface. The depth of the wood beam at 1.8 m as
described by Leslie’s informants, presumably left at the deepest point of the looter excavation,
falls within the 1.6 to 2.2 m depths of the 2015 excavations. It is our conclusion that the verbal
account of the fill deposit and floor surface provided by the unnamed informants refers to the
excavation of the laminated sediments filling the caliche pipe or storage facility in the
southeastern corner of the room. Their description of the floor as “hard, smooth caliche” does not
match the compacted red clay composition of the upper floor of Pit Structure 2, nor the floors of
the other pit structures and domestic rooms, but it does match the bottom of the deep excavation
unit. Of course, this conclusion leads to another conclusion: that the deep excavation was done
in 1964 or 1965 and not during a later period.
Surely, given his keen sense of observation and detail, if Leslie had personally witnessed the deep
excavation he would have included the details of its location and depth in his manuscript. Taking
into account that Leslie probably had only a verbal report from the unnamed excavators, it would
be prudent to place little faith in that account. Leslie’s cross-section of Structure 2 is probably a
189

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

schematic impression based on the informant description, which explains why it is shown as
extending across the room interior.
Our interpretation of Pit Structure 2 is that it had a single floor at or near the elevation of the
upper floor described by Leslie. Unlike Pit Structure 1, there is no evidence of remodeling and
constructing a second floor in Pit Structure 2. The shape and dimensions are also troublesome,
and the 2015 excavations were unable to resolve the atypical shape of the walls and the position
of the entryway. Pit Structure 2 had the same conditions of heavily disturbed walls and deeply
pitted caliche conglomerate surfaces around the interior perimeter as observed for Pit Structure 1,
and the original shape and dimensions could not be determined.
The discordant radiocarbon age estimate from the remnant floor feature or lens of backwashed fill
presents another problem and is examined in greater detail in Chapter Nine. It is concluded that
the charcoal sample derived from a looter campfire that incorporated mesquite deadwood from
the site surface or was charcoal from a Protohistoric or Early Historic feature or deposit that
somehow became mixed with the backdirt that infilled Feature 2.1.

SUMMARY OF PIT STRUCTURE EXCAVATIONS
Two of the most intriguing and significant features at the Merchant site are the large and deep pit
structures investigated by Robert Leslie and the Lea County Archaeological Society in the early
1960s. The 2015 excavations were designed to establish if any architectural attributes or features
remained intact, to clarify the size, depth, and shape of the structures, to examine the nature of the
fill and backdirt deposits, and to obtain chronometric and subsistence samples. In turn, these
studies would contribute to interpretations of the social function of the structures, their life
histories (after Walker 1995, 2002), and evidence of ritual closure or termination.
The 2015 re-excavation efforts removed the backwashed refuse deposits and traced remnants of
floors and floor features. The results of these excavations were then correlated with the LCAS
investigations in an attempt to reconstruct the morphology, life history, and function of the two
pit structures. The ability to interpret the form and function of the two structures and their
remodeling and abandonment histories was partially contingent upon how badly certain fill strata
and architectural attributes were damaged by looting. Nevertheless, some attributes were defined,
such as the fact that Pit Structure 2 did not have an earlier, lower, floor.

Several areas of LA 43414 beyond the LCAS village area were investigated during the 2014 and
2015 fieldwork, including pithouses, bedrock mortars and cupules, and isolated hearth features.
The most intriguing and potentially significant of these investigations were focused on several
areas of patterned surface concentrations of caliche cobbles that were tentatively identified as
agricultural features.
Surface rooms and roomblocks had been recorded to the north and northwest of the LCAS village
area during seismic line surveys in 1991 and 2009 (Allison et al. 2009; Gregory 2001; Seymour
2001). Several surface structures were identified within Locus 3 (LA 65396) at the northwestern
corner of LA 43414 and a 24 m by 17 m area of contiguous rooms and foundation walls was
recorded at the southern margins of Locus 5. Two surface structures were identified in Locus 3
during the TRU survey and site mapping conducted in 2014. Several areas of dense surface
concentrations of caliche cobbles were observed within and to the southeast of Locus 5.
However, no evidence of midden areas and dense artifact distributions typical of pueblo
settlements was found in association with the cobble concentrations.
Instead, Mark Willis, Charles Frederick, and other members of the project team with experience
working with ak chin fields in Arizona, cobble terraces in Chihuahua, and mulch or grid gardens
in the northern Rio Grande, Jemez, and Chama valleys of New Mexico suggested that the
seemingly patterned distributions of cobbles resembled mulch gardens, grid gardens, or cobble
mound terraces associated with agricultural settlements throughout the US Southwest and
northern Chihuahua (Doolittle 2000). Certain areas within the caliche concentrations appeared to
have linear and rectangular boundaries (Figure 7.1) similar to grid or mulch gardens. In addition
to the caliche concentrations, a series of linear caliche mounds arranged across the drainage in the
center of the site were mapped during the TRU survey.

Chapter Seven
Geomorphological and Archaeological Investigations of Possible
Agricultural Features

Together these features suggest that a landscape of intensive agricultural features may have
existed to the north and northwest of the LCAS village and other settlement areas at LA 43414.
The reality of this became more apparent as the results of pollen analysis and flotation from the
excavation of Pit Structure 1 revealed that maize pollen and cupule, kernel, and cob fragments
were present throughout the fill and floor features. The high counts and sample ubiquity
measurements for maize plant parts and the presence of maize pollen confirmed that corn was
grown somewhere in the vicinity of the Merchant site
If grid gardens, mulch fields, or terraces existed at LA 43414, they would represent the
easternmost expression of such intensive agricultural technologies in the Southwest.
Accordingly, an integrated geomorphological and archaeological investigation of the possible
agricultural features was proposed to the CFO, and a contract modification and additional funding
was granted to study the features in greater detail. The study included geomorphological
investigations of trench profiles excavated through segments of the features, manual excavation
of two features (Figure 7.2), and analyses of a series of pollen, soil, and chronometric samples. A
shallow ponding area, or playa, west of the escarpment was also trenched and examined for
agricultural potential.

Geoarchaeological Investigations: Searching for Prehistoric Agricultural
Fields
One of the principle remits of the geoarchaeological study was to assess the environment around
the Merchant site for places where agriculture could have been practiced by the site’s inhabitants.
Prior to the initiation of fieldwork, this work was directed toward the alluvial deposits associated
with the small basin playa to the west of the site. But following the aerial survey and the
discovery of cobble stone alignments on the mesa within and adjacent to the site, the work was
refocused and directed toward two locations: 1) a portion of the basin floor that appears dark on
aerial images and was often referred to as a playa, and 2) the mesa surface within and east of the
site. After examining both locations in the field, the majority of the field effort was redirected to
the linear stone features on the mesa.
Trench Excavations
Four backhoe trenches were excavated to provide subsurface profiles of possible agricultural
features and the playa landform to the west of the site (Table 7.1, Figure 7.3).
Backhoe Trench 1 was placed at the margins of a suspected playa 698 m southwest of the LCAS
village area. Backhoe Trench 2 was placed in the northwest area of the site across a portion of
Feature 95, a possible agricultural terrace. Backhoe Trench 3 was placed through Feature 90,
another possible agriculture feature. Backhoe Trench 4 was a small trench placed 40 m beyond
the northern site boundary. The trench was excavated in eolian sheet sand and coppice dune
deposits to provide a control profile and pollen and soil sampling column to compare against
similar series of samples collected from the suspected agricultural features.
The Playa
A single backhoe trench (Trench 1) was excavated into the basin floor in the vicinity of the dark
colored (low albedo) area visible on aerial photographs (Figure 7.3). Upon arriving at this
location, it was immediately apparent that the term “playa” is not an appropriate description of
the basin floor. Although the surface of the San Simon Swale in the region around the site
exhibits many poorly drained depressions that are easily visible on aerial images such as those
available through Google Earth, most of these are solution/collapse depressions that are clearly
internally drained. As noted previously, the basin may also be a karstic collapse or solution
feature, but today this depression is clearly drained by alluvial channels and this is likely to

have been the case for a considerable period of time. The area of dark albedo appeared to be
caused by slightly denser vegetation, and there was no evidence on the surface of water ponding
in this area. To be sure, these ephemeral channels that drain the north and east sides of the basin
undoubtedly delivered abundant water to the basin floor at times in the past, and this landscape
provides numerous small patches that would have been easily amenable to passive water
harvesting techniques. Likewise, it would have required little effort to block and or divert runoff
to areas for irrigation; and such features, if made by past inhabitants, would have very little
probability of being preserved in the long term.
The trench excavated on the basin floor exhibited two alluvial deposits (Table 7.2; Figure 7.4).
The upper 16 cm (Zone 1) consisted of a silt loam to silty clay loam with a small amount of fine
gravel, primarily redeposited caliche fragments, and within which a weak soil had formed. This
AC horizon was inferred to be of recent age (most likely Historic) and was probably not present
at the time the site was inhabited. Beneath this was an alluvial deposit that appears to have begun
deposition in the late Pleistocene and probably aggraded incrementally throughout the Holocene.
This deposit exhibited an A-AB-Bk soil profile, where the A horizon (Zone 2) was a cumulic
dusky red silty clay. A few fine reworked caliche gravels were present in the A and AB (Zone 3)
horizons. The Bk horizon (Zone 4) comprised a dusky red clay within which a weak Stage II
(nodular) calcic horizon had formed. This zone contained 5-7 percent calcium carbonate
filaments, and few to common (1-5 percent) medium (5-7 mm) hard, irregular-shaped calcium
carbonate nodules. The degree of calcic horizon development suggests that this alluvial deposit
began to aggrade either in the early Holocene or late Pleistocene. No cultural material was
observed within this trench exposure.

The Mesa
Prior to the geoarchaeological fieldwork, TRU surface survey of the site by Tim Graves and
aerial surveys by Mark Willis identified linear concentrations of cobble-sized stones on the
surface of the mesa in the northern part of the site and to the east of the site that may be indicative
of prehistoric agricultural features. These “features” appeared to be linear groups of stones less
than 1 m wide that were primarily visible cropping out between the coppice dunes and in the
center of the very gently concave water gathering slope that occurs in the north part of the site
(Figure 7.5, upper panel) west of the previously identified Locus 6 and within and southeast of
Locus 5. Similar features were also observed outside the site boundary to the north exposed
within the two-track dirt road that joins the pipeline that runs east-west immediately north of the
site (Figure 7.5, lower panel). By comparison, the area between these linear concentrations of
gravel and cobbles are relatively stone free and appear to be enclosed by the cobble stone
concentrations. “Appear” is the most appropriate word, because the coppice dunes preclude any
kind of clear view of these features and it was impossible to see the true spatial pattern associated
with these stone alignments. The initial impression was that these features may be prehistoric
agricultural terraces, but the occurrence of alignments in orientations other than perpendicular to
downslope overland flow suggests that they are more akin to grid gardens or rock-bordered grids
(cf. Doolittle 2000:239-253; Wiseman and Ware 1996).

These cobble stone alignments were investigated initially by two shallow backhoe trenches that
were placed transverse to some of these alignments. Trench 2 was situated across a suite of
approximately three of these alignments (Figure 7.6). This map also shows one significant
attribute of these features, namely that they occur in lines that are parallel to topographic contours
(grey arrow indicates slope) as well as perpendicular to it, which is not a common feature of
terraces. Also notable on this figure is how the coppice dunes and recent dune sand obscure
visibility of these stone features. Hence, obtaining a clear image of the features, be it from an
aerial photograph or on the ground, was exceedingly difficult.

Trench 2 revealed several interesting observations (Figure 7.7; Table 7.3;). First, the deposits
exposed consisted of a thin (<10 cm) drape of Recent Eolian Sand across the areas between the
coppice dunes, and this deposit thickened considerably to form the coppice dunes. The Recent
Eolian Sand rested unconformably upon an A-horizon formed in the Upper Eolian Sand. This
deposit was generally less than 30 cm thick and rested unconformably upon the laminar cap of the
Mescalero Paleosol/Caliche. In most places, the top of the calcrete was mantled with a scatter of
loose rounded to subrounded calcrete cobbles and gravel and some of the cobbles were also
observed suspended in the eolian sand. The stone alignments appeared to clearly be places where
these loose clasts were stacked (or at least multiple clasts resting one upon another).

Comment: This hand-excavated exposure was located on the north side of the site near the pipeline road. It was
intended to be off site, but given the extensive coppice dunes in this area, it is not clear if it is. A pollen sample was
collected from a depth of 45-50 cm within Zone 2.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Two such alignments are visible in Figure 7.8, one at the left (south) end of the drawing, under
the coppice dune, and another at the right (north side) of this drawing. The concentration of
cobbles at the south end, beneath the coppice dune appeared to coincide with an elevated part of
the laminar calcrete, whereas the cobble concentration on the right side of the drawing was not
associated with any significant variation in the calcrete surface. Between the two cobble stone
alignments was a patch of relatively stone-free soil, which had a small number of stones
suspended within it (highlighted by the brown tone on Figure 7.8).
Two soil samples were collected from Trench 2 for pollen analysis to determine if any pollen of
cultigens was present. The first sample was collected from near the top of the paleosol about 2 m
north from the south end of the trench; whereas the second was collected about 6.5 m north of the
south end of the trench. Smith (see Chapter Ten) reports that these samples exhibited relatively
low pollen concentration (2150 to 2580 grains/gram), a significant number of degraded grains
(15.4% and 22.7%) and were dominated by Asteraceae (sunflower family) and Cheno-am pollen,
with minor amounts of mustard family, yucca type, juniper and Tidestromia (possibly wooly
honeysweet) pollen. No evidence of domesticated pollen was observed.
Following the trench excavations, a small bock of hand excavated units (Block 10) was placed
around one of the alignments near Trench 2 and was designated Feature 95. The results of this
excavation are described later in this chapter.
Trench 3 was excavated across another series of linear stone piles, and a segment of this trench
profile is profiled Figure 7.9. The stratigraphy is similar to Trench 2, and like Trench 2, the rocks
visible on the ground surface appear to represent clast-supported piles of rock separated by areas
of sandy soil lacking many rocks (Figure 7.10). Unlike Trench 2, the area of soil between the
rock piles in this trench contained numerous rocks beneath the eolian sand resting directly upon
the caliche, which is similar to the results obtained from the hand excavation of Feature 95.
Two soil samples were collected from the relatively stone-free soil formed at the top of the Upper
Eolian Sand in Trench 3 and were submitted for pollen analysis. The first of these was located
approximately 0.75 m from the west end of the trench, and the second was located about 2.35 m
from the west end of the trench; both samples were collected from 5 to 10 cm below the top of the
paleosol. These samples had lower pollen concentration than the samples from Trench 2 (961
and 1285 grains/gram) but surprisingly exhibited the greatest taxon richness. The first sample
contained 15 different taxa and was dominated by Asteraceae and Cheno-am pollen. It also
included fir, pine and alder, which presumably are vestiges of Pleistocene vegetation. Neither
sample revealed any pollen from domesticated plants.
In addition to the trench excavations focused on the presumed agricultural features, an informal
excavation was made outside the site in an attempt to expose a profile that had been unaffected by
prehistoric agriculture. Given the degree to which the coppice dunes obscure the ground surface
in this area, it is impossible to be completely certain that this area was outside the area of
potential cultivation. This resulting profile, termed the control profile, was excavated into the
side of a coppice dune immediately south of the pipeline that lies immediately north of the site,
and this excavated section exposed 95 cm of sand resting upon calcrete. The soil profile exposed
exhibited a C-2Ab-2AC-3K soil profile (see Table 7.3) where the C horizon at the top was
composed of the Recent Eolian Sand, which was slightly less than 40 cm thick (on the flank of
the coppice dune). The buried soil beneath the coppice dune was weakly expressed, 30 cm thick,
and formed within the Upper Eolian Sand. This buried soil was significantly less melanized than
the buried soil exposed by Trenches 2 and 3. A 25-cm thick AC horizon separated the bottom of
the buried soil from the top of the Mescalero calcrete.

A single pollen sample was collected from the paleosol in the control profile, and like the
samples collected from Trenches 2 and 3, did not yield any evidence of domesticated plants.
Like the other samples, this sample also had a low pollen concentration (1214 grains/gram),
numerous degraded grains, and was dominated by Asteraceae, Cheno-am, and grass pollen.
Comparison of Possible Agricultural Fields and the Control Profile
In addition to examining the stratigraphy associated with the possible agricultural features, a
suite of soil samples were collected from each trench as well as the control profile in order to
permit direct comparison of the deposits.
Methods: A suite of 71 soil samples were collected in four profiles from three excavations
(Trenches 2, 3, and the control profile), and these were subjected to laboratory analysis in order
to determine the texture, magnetic susceptibility, organic matter content, and calcium carbonate
content. Samples were primarily collected in the field in 2.5 cm plastic paleomagnetic sample
boxes. Particle size analysis was determined using a Beckman-Coulter LS 13-320 laser particle
size analyzer, whereas the organic matter and carbonate content were determined by loss-onignition in a muffle furnace at 500˚ and 1000˚ C, respectively. The magnetic susceptibility was
determined on a Bartington MS2 meter using an MS2b sensor. The results of these analyses are
provided in Table 7.4 and in graphic form in Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12.

Chapter Seven
Geomorphological and Archaeological Investigations of Possible
Agricultural Features

Trench 2: Two short columns of soil samples were collected from Trench 2 in order to
document the nature of the deposits (see Figure 7.8 for locations of the columns). Column 1
was located through the coppice dune at the south end of the trench, whereas Column 2 was
placed through one of the relatively stone-free areas about 1.5 m north of Column 1. Column 1
demonstrated that the Recent Eolian Sand is slightly coarser textured than the soil formed in the
Upper Eolian Sand beneath it. The coppice dune samples are all fine sand (mean particle size of
2.4 to 2.6 phi; fine sand) whereas the underlying soil is a loamy fine sand with a mean particle
size ranging between 2.6 to 2.9 phi, and about twice as much silt (8.7% to 12.4%) and clay (5%
to 6.5%) as the overlying Recent Eolian Sand (3.6% to 6.2% silt; 2.7% to 2.6% clay). In
Column 1, the Recent Eolian sand of the coppice dune exhibited a lower magnetic susceptibility
than the underlying soil formed in the Upper Eolian Sand (which is within expectations). But in
Column 2, the opposite trend was present, with the drape of Recent Eolian Sand having a higher
magnetic susceptibility than all but the uppermost sample of the soil formed in the Upper Eolian
Sand.
Trench 3: A column of soil samples was also collected from one of the relatively stone-free
areas in Trench 3, and the results of the lab analysis of these samples is depicted on Figure 7.11.
The results of this work were similar to those obtained from Column 2 in Trench 2.
Control Column: A suite of 34 soil samples was collected from this control profile and analyzed
in the lab. The results of this work are shown on Figure 7.12. In general terms, the results are
similar to those observed from the trench excavations in regards to the texture of the two
different eolian deposits, showing that the Upper Eolian Sand is slightly finer textured than the
Recent Eolian Sand. When compared to the possible agricultural fields, the organic matter in
the control profile is less for both eolian stratigraphic units, as is the magnetic susceptibility. It
is possible that the thinner (20-30 cm) solum of the Upper Eolian Sand in the trench profiles
more effectively concentrated the organic matter in this soil than the nearly 60 cm thick profile
in the control column. The calcium carbonate shows a steady but minor increase from the
ground surface down toward the base of the paleosol formed at the top of the Upper Eolian
Sand and then declines dramatically in the AC horizon that rests directly upon the calcrete. The
dramatic decline in soil carbonate here is unusual for a natural soil A horizon, which typically
have very gradual increases with depth.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Hand Excavation of Two Features
Two of the possible agricultural features were investigated through the excavation of small hand
units. Feature 108 was located near the northeastern margin of the possible features and was
situated among deep eolian sands and coppice dunes. Feature 95 was the location examined by
Backhoe Trench 2 near the southwestern margin of the features and was positioned on the sloping
terrain along the shallow drainage crossing through the center of the site.
Hand excavations were intended to expose portions of the linear cobble alignments in planview to
complement the profiles exposed in backhoe trenches. The excavations would provide contexts
for additional pollen and radiocarbon sampling.
Feature 108
Feature 108 was recorded during TRU survey as series of linear cobble concentrations across the
shallow drainage. The features were thought to be possible check dams or rubble mounds
bordering garden areas. The feature covered a 20-by-20 meter area and over 100 caliche cobbles
were exposed in the surface concentrations and linear patterns.
A 3-m by 3-m excavation block was established over the northeast corner of the caliche
concentration to examine one linear alignment of caliche cobbles. Only a single artifact, a
unimarginally retouched tool, had been recorded near this area during the TRU survey. The
block was excavated as a single level through 3 to 10 cm of eolian sand to a layer of brown sandy
loam and sediments were screened through ⅛-inch mesh. The excavation exposed a semi-circular
alignment of caliche cobbles in the northern 2 m by 6 m portion of the block (Figure 7.13). The
alignment measured 2.6 m in diameter. The center of the alignment was clear of caliche cobbles,
measured 1.6 m in diameter, and had an opening to the west. The interior fill within the semicircular alignment of caliche cobbles consisted of a dark brown sandy loam.
No artifacts were present on the surface of the block, but excavation recovered a relatively high
quantity of materials, including 89 debitage, 10 utilized flakes, three unimarginal core tools
(chopper), one uniface, one biface, four projectile points, one core, two metate fragments, and
three Jornada/Roswell Brown and two Ochoa Indented sherds. The projectile points included one
Harrell, one Palmillas, and an unidentified base and tip.
A float sample was collected from the interior fill, but only a trace of unidentifiable wood
charcoal was recovered. The charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon dating, yielding an
conventional age estimate of 1110 ± 30 BP that calibrates to A.D. 880-1010 at 2-sigma.
Feature 95
Feature 95 was first recorded as four linear alignments of over 5,000 caliche cobbles distributed
across a 40 m by 20 m area. As with other linear cobble alignments, the long axis of Feature 95
was oriented from the southeast to the northwest at an approximate azimuth of 135 degrees. The
items observed on the surface during TRU survey were two sandstone slab metate fragments.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

The northeastern edge of the feature was exposed in Backhoe Trench 2 (see Figure 7.6) and
identified as a possible agricultural cobble terrace based on the absence of caliche cobbles
between mounded linear alignments of cobbles. The excavation block for Feature 95 was placed
3 m to the south of Backhoe Trench 2 to determine if the cobble mounds observed in the trench
profile extended beyond the trench. A 2 m north/south by 4 m east/west block was established
and excavated in 1 m subunits. Sediments were screened through ⅛-inch mesh. Surface deposits
consisted of unconsolidated eolian sands with two clusters of caliche cobbles that extended
outside the unit (Figure 7.14).

Figure 7.14. View of Feature 95 on the surface with excavation unit. The line of caliche at the right side of
the photograph is material excavated from and backfilled into Backhoe Trench 2.

The block was excavated in two arbitrary levels. The first removed the upper 2 cm to 10 cm of
eolian sand and exposed two clusters of caliche cobbles with an empty area between them similar
to Feature 108 (Figure 7.15). Based on the presence of additional rocks outside the block
exposure, the alignments extend at least 2 m to the north and south beyond the unit (Figure 7.16).
Excavation of Level 2 further defined the feature and revealed that the morphology of the
alignments exposed in Level 1 was misleading. Another 2 to 12 cm of brown sandy loam was
removed, exposing a single mounded alignment of caliche cobbles (Figure 7.15 and Figure 7.16).
The portion of the feature exposed in the block measured 2.0 meters in width and at least 2.6 m in
length and extended 34 cm below the surface. A key observation is that the cobbles were stacked
upon each other forming a linear mound of cobbles and the areas to the east and west of the
mound were mostly devoid of cobbles (Figure 7.16, lower right panel). It is also noteworthy that
the alignment extended three to four meters to the north where a mounded terrace feature was
mapped in the profile of Backhoe Trench 2.

cobble mound. The image at the lower right provides a close up view of the mounded cobbles.

Another key attribute of Feature 95 is that no charcoal-stained sediments or charcoal fragments
were observed anywhere throughout the fill or among the mounded cobbles. While this
observation provides a key point for interpreting the feature, it was not possible to obtain a
radiocarbon date for the feature due to the absence of charcoal.
As with Feature 108, while no artifacts were present on the surface of the excavation unit, a
moderate quantity of materials was recovered during excavation. The material recovered
includes 39 flakes, one uniface, one biface, one projectile point (a reworked corner-notch type), a
sandstone slab metate fragment, and three El Paso Brownware sherds. Most of the items were
recovered from Level 1, but several flakes and the metate fragment were from the deeper deposits
just above the caliche cobble mound.

Discussion
In order to assess the origin of these linear stone features, it is best to reduce them to their most
fundamental attributes as documented through the geomorphological investigations:
1) The features consist of what appear to be linear clast-supported piles of gravel and
cobbles;
2) they rest on the Mescalero calcrete;
3) they are composed of rounded caliche cobbles and gravel;
4) the features exhibit a wide range of orientations (parallel and perpendicular to
topographic contours);
5) the areas between stone alignments often (but not always) have many fewer stones, and
the stones in these areas are often matrix supported;
6) the coppice dunes hinder a clear view of their plan arrangement.
214

Chapter Seven
Geomorphological and Archaeological Investigations of Possible
Agricultural Features

A Natural Origin?
At the start of this discussion it is a good idea to consider what, if any, natural processes could
create such features. The only natural features that come to mind are sorted stone circles and
stripes that are created by periglacial conditions, which in this case would have to be relicts of the
Pleistocene. Such features are created in regions subject to permafrost and are formed by the
repeated freezing and thawing of the soil in the active layer which differentially moves rocks,
resulting in a bewildering array of repetitive stone alignments and patterns. Examination of
regional summaries (e.g. Hawley 2005) that might record such features in this landscape reveals
no reference to such features in this region (although he does note them in higher altitude
settings). Discussion with geomorphologists with extensive experience within the region
concurred that none have ever been recorded (Vance Holliday [University of Arizona] and Dustin
Sweet [Texas Tech University], personal communication, 2016). So it seems unlikely that these
are periglacial relicts from the Pleistocene.
The low gradient surface that characterizes part of the mesa surface where these features are
found is most likely too flat for rocks of this size to be moved substantially by overland flow.
And even if they could be moved by overland flow, that process would be unlikely to stack them
multiple clasts high.
The rocks that comprise the stone alignments are most likely clasts derived from the Mescalero
Caliche, which in many places comprises subrounded to subangular cobbles and gravel of
caliche. That these rocks are loose on the top of the laminar calcrete and not cemented to it
suggests that they are a byproduct of erosion and/or disturbance of the caliche. This loose veneer
of gravel and cobbles could be formed by at least two processes: bioturbation and channelized
erosion. Walking across the site, it was noted than burrowing animals are capable of penetrating
the caliche and casting the resulting rocks onto the ground surface (Figure 7.17). One would
expect that such clasts would be mixed with the eolian sand and possibly form a matrix-supported
deposit, but one would also expect such rocks to be fairly angular. Solution etching of the caliche
fragments once they had been enveloped by the eolian sand could explain some of the rounding.
The second possible origin is channelized erosion of the calcrete. Although these clasts appear to
be too large to be moved about by overland flow, their origin may be a product of more
channelized erosion of the caliche prior to the deposition of the eolian sand that mantles this
surface today. But no evidence of such erosion of the caliche was noted during the fieldwork,
and it is unlikely that channelized movement of gravels across this surface would result in this
wide range of orientations visible today. Hence, it is probable that the clasts that comprise these
alignments are derived from disturbance of the caliche, and that the linear piles are most likely
the product of human activity which moved loose gravel clasts that were scattered across the top
of the Mescalero caliche and within the Upper Eolian Sand into linear piles.
The Archaeological Evidence
The archaeological excavations provided additional details, albeit somewhat ambiguous and
contradictory, on the morphology, artifact associations, and chronology of the features. The
nature of Feature 108 remains uncertain. It could be a disturbed cobble mound or perhaps even
the remains of a domestic structure. We have a more concise impression of the morphology and
function of Feature 95. Excavation revealed a linear arrangement of stacked and mounded
caliche cobbles extending across the surface of the excavation unit and backhoe trench profile.
Areas on both sides of the mound were mostly devoid of cobbles, and no charcoal-stained cultural
sediments were associated with the feature. Feature 95 and other features exposed in the backhoe
trenches and excavation units at LA 43414 have some similarities with boundary walls of grid

215

animal has excavated through the eolian cover and into the caliche. The scatter of caliche clasts exhumed
by this burrow is about 2 m wide.

gardens and mulch fields in northern New Mexico. For example, Camilli and Banet’s (2012) test
excavation of several fields on river valley terraces at the confluence of the Chama and Rio
Grande rivers in New Mexico exposed segments of boundary walls that, while more formally
constructed of large, smoothed river cobbles, have similar arrangements of stacked cobbles as
seen in the excavation and planviews at LA 43414. Accordingly, we suggest that Feature 95
represents what a grid or mulch garden might look like on the plains of southeastern New
Mexico. It is not as formal or extensive as examples from other regions of the Southwest but
nevertheless reflects a less intensive form of grid garden.
Other observations from the excavations pose additional problems for interpretation. A
surprising number and variety of artifacts were recovered from both features, including each of
the major functional artifact classes of chipped stone debitage and tools, projectile points,
groundstone, and ceramics. The only major artifact category absent among these features was
faunal bone, which of itself may be an important insight that they did not have a residential
function. We are not quite certain why the full suite of domestic artifact classes was present in
these features, but it is clear that the presence of numerous artifacts in an area where none were
expected indicates that this section of the LA 43414 landscape was actively used by the
prehistoric inhabitants.
However, our presumption that prehistoric Southwestern farming societies maintained a
distinction between field and home may be unwarranted. Most prehistoric groups performed
various activities in and around fields, including field maintenance and auxiliary production tasks
like projectile point manufacture conducted while guarding fields, garden hunting, and even the
occupation of field houses. The above-mentioned excavation of mulch fields in the Chama and
216

Chapter Seven
Geomorphological and Archaeological Investigations of Possible
Agricultural Features

Rio Grande valleys recovered quantities of ceramic and chipped stone artifacts (Camilli and
Banet 2012) similar to those recovered from Features 95 and 108. One possible but speculative
explanation is that small, ephemeral field houses were constructed among the grid gardens to
monitor and guard the crops against predators. This might explain the presence of chipped stone
and ceramic artifacts and absence of processed animal bone. This explanation may be critiqued
by fact that the possible agricultural gardens are located a distance of only 100 to 125 meters
from the LCAS village. However, similar patterns of field houses located near agricultural fields
only a couple hundred meters from pueblo roomblocks are documented in the Pajarito Plateau
and other regions of the Southwest (Gauthier and Herhahn 2005; Gauthier et al. 2007; Kohler
2004; Powers and Orcutt 1999).
Last, but by no means of least importance, is the fact that the age of the two excavated features
remains uncertain. The single radiocarbon age estimate of A.D. 880–1010 from Feature 108
predates the occupation of the LCAS village area by a minimum of three centuries. The date was
obtained from a tiny fragment of wood charcoal, and the origin of the sample is somewhat
questionable. Ochoa Indented ceramics, a Harrell-type projectile point, and a Palmillas-type
point were recovered from the unit, each of which either predates or postdates the radiocarbon
date. An equally ambiguous assortment of temporally diagnostic artifacts was recovered from
Feature 95, including a reworked Late Archaic point and El Paso Brownware body sherds that
may date from A.D. 500 to 1450. No radiocarbon date could be obtained for the feature. At this
point the chronological placement of the two features cannot be determined with certainty.
Anthropogenic origins?
The general appearance of these features led us to initially think they were possibly cobble
agricultural terraces similar to those described by Fish et al. (1986) and subsequently illustrated
by Doolittle (2000:292), but closer inspection made it clear that these concentrations of stone
occurred in a wide range of orientations beyond those typically observed with terraces, which
raises questions about their origin and function. After excavation of the trench profiles across
these features and the discovery of the relatively stone-free areas of soil between them, they
began to seem more like clearance features associated with grid gardens rather than terraces. This
is not to say that water retention could not be one of their functions, but rather that the
interpretation of these linear stone piles as terraces does not fully account for their apparent
morphology.
In his compilation of Native American agricultural practices, Doolittle (2000:246-248), in the
chapter on dry farming, describes the widespread occurrence of rock-bordered grids which range
from rectangular areas bordered with a single line of stones to linear piles of rocks. In some cases
these features have been mistaken for prehistoric buildings (e.g. Greenlee 1933:13; and Skinner
1965; as cited in Doolittle 200:246; Wiseman and Ware 1996) as may have been the case here as
well for Locus 5.
Doolittle (2000:243) notes “all of them date between AD 1200 … and the arrival of Europeans …
with most being used in the 1400s…” This general age assessment is in good agreement with the
occupation of the LCAS village area as determined by radiocarbon assays (Chapter Nine), but as
noted above, the dating of the actual features was inconclusive.
Soil Analysis
Comparison of the physical attributes of the presumably agricultural field soils with the control
profile provides a means of assessing the possible lasting effects of ancient agricultural uses of
these soils. Previous studies have examined changes in soils associated with prehistoric
agriculture (e.g. Sandor et al 2008; Homburg and Sandor 2011) and have identified both positive
and negative results. Among the more common signs of soil degradation observed in formerly
217

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

cultivated soils are decreases in organic matter (and resulting lighter color) and nutrients (such as
total nitrogen) and increases in bulk density. Comparison of the presumed agricultural soils with
the control profile here reveals several differences. In specific, the presumed agricultural soils are
generally more organic-rich, darker colored, slightly finer textured, and exhibit higher magnetic
susceptibility values than the control profile. Many of these differences are opposite of what
might be expected from agricultural use and may simply reflect variations in the properties of the
deposits across the site, especially as a function of deposit thickness.
Pollen Analysis
The use of palynology to confirm agricultural use of a specific location has been employed for
quite some time and the results range from positive to unsatisfactory. The use of this method
assumes that pollen preservation is excellent, that the pollen found reflects activity on this surface
and is not a function of long distance transport, and that the assemblage has not been altered by
differential preservation. The latter is perhaps the most problematic issue. Differential pollen
preservation complicates the assumption that preserved fossil pollen is an adequate way to
identify former agricultural fields (Bryant et al. 1994:57; Pearsall 2014) given that such
deterioration does not affect all types pollen equally, thereby distorting the record. Bryant et al.
(1994) note that the most significant clues to degraded pollen assemblages are 1) the percentage
of indeterminate grains, 2) low pollen concentration, and 3) low diversity. High levels of
indeterminate pollen, coupled with low concentration and low diversity, indicate a compromised
pollen assemblage which should be viewed with caution. Somewhat paradoxically, the project
sample with the lowest pollen concentration (BT3-1) had the highest richness and the lowest
number of degraded or indeterminate grains. No evidence of domesticated pollen was observed
within these samples, but the attributes of the pollen data compiled by Smith (Chapter Ten)
suggest that differential preservation may be an issue here and the results should be considered
cautiously. Smith also notes that maize pollen is often concentrated in the uppermost soil levels
of agricultural fields. In the case of the Merchant site, the uppermost level might have degraded
pollen assemblages typical of constantly mixed and churned eolian sediments. Additional
sampling of near-surface deposits will be required to evaluate this problem. In their summary of
similar findings from agricultural fields in the Mimbres region, Homburg and Sandor (2011)
invoke Carl Sagan’s quote “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”
Residue Analysis
The soil and organic samples from the two possible agricultural fields were also unsuitable for
FTIR or protein residue analysis. A metate fragment from Feature 95 and a core tool (chopper)
from Feature 108 were submitted for starch grain and phytolith analysis. The results of the
analysis are presented in Appendix C. No starch grain residues were present on the tools.
Phytoliths identified on the tools include several grass species and a dicot tentatively identified as
creosote. No phytoliths from known economic or subsistence plants were found on the tools.

Summary
The work reported here examined the landscape around the Merchant site for locations where
agriculture may have been practiced. A single trench was placed into the floor of the basin, and
this trench revealed evidence of two alluvial deposits, one recent and one that has probably
accumulated throughout the Holocene. The suite of alluvial deposits that occupy the basin slope
and floor are far more complex than time permitted to document, but several points were clear.
Examination of numerous cutbanks adjacent to the modern stream channels, as well as the profile
of Trench 1, failed to reveal any evidence of ponded or lacustrine sediment. This basin has most
likely not ponded water in any significant amounts for a very long time. It is possible that this
may have occurred in the early stages of the development of this depression, but that would have
been long before the site was inhabited. Although there was no evidence of agricultural use of
218

Agricultural Features

the basin floor, this setting would have been amenable to such use and may well have formed part
of a risk minimization strategy when combined with use of the mesa top.
The results of the work done on the mesa in conjunction with the linear stone alignments suggest
that these features are probably the result of human agency, presumably for agricultural purposes.
Their morphology is most consistent with grid gardens or rock-bordered grids which are most
common in the Rio Chama, Jemez, and Galisteo basins (Camilli et al. 2012; Buge 1984; Cordell
et al. 1984; Doolittle 2000:245; Lang 1995; Lightfoot and Eddy 1995). Most of the work that has
been done with such features has examined the use of stone mulches, whereas the “rock-bordered
grids that do not contain a gravel layer are far more numerous and widespread than mulched
fields, but absolutely nothing is known about them” (Doolittle 2000:252). Although Doolittle
does not comment specifically about where features such as this have been found, low-gradient
shallow drainages on the top of mesas are one of the most common settings for prehistoric
terraces (Doolittle 2000:294).
Examination of trench exposures across two sets of these features suggests that the relatively
rock-free soil in between the linear stone piles are an artifact of rocks having been taken from
these areas and moved to the piles, and therefore, at least to some degree, these features may
represent clearance cairns. The soils between the linear stone piles exhibit more organic matter,
slightly finer textures, and higher magnetic susceptibility than the same deposits in the control
profile, but whether these differences are due to agricultural use or are more due to other soil
formation processes is unclear at this time. Analysis of nine pollen samples collected from the
presumed fields failed to yield any evidence of pollen from maize or other domesticated plants.
While pollen analysis of the possible agricultural features was inconclusive, the results from the
LCAS habitation area were much more revealing. As proven by the pollen and macrobotanical
record of Pit Structure 1, there is little doubt that the occupants of the Merchant site were
agriculturalists, and thus there is also little doubt that maize fields once existed somewhere in the
vicinity of the LCAS village. The water ponding area to the west of the site proved to be an
unlikely location for intensive maize farming and thus begs the question: if not around the
ponding area, then where were the gardens and fields used by the site’s inhabitants?
In the final analysis, there is much about these features that remains unclear. The spatial pattern
of these features is largely obscured by the coppice dunes, so even the most fundamental
attributes are somewhat murky. But the setting and arrangement of the stone piles seems to be
beyond any natural process operative at this location in the late Holocene, so they are most likely
anthropogenic in origin, and an agricultural purpose would seem to be the most likely use.

The Scope of Work issued by the Carlsbad Field Office stipulated that four features located
within or outside of the LCAS village area were to be investigated to better characterize the range
of occupations at LA 43414. The features included the probable pithouse identified during
Speth’s 1984 fieldwork and shovel tested by the CFO as part of the Permian Basin radiocarbon
study, a second feature shovel tested by the CFO, and two fire-cracked rock features at southern
edge of LA 43414 within or near Locus 1 as defined by the LMAS survey (Figure 8.1).

Feature 39
Feature 39 was first investigated by John Speth during his 1984 field investigation. Speth’s Test
Unit 84-1 was placed in a surface stain located a distance of 16.8 m and an angle of 28 degrees
from surface Room 7 and 4.3 m east of the two-track dirt road (see Figure 8.1). The unit
measured 2.85 m by 0.5 m. A 0.95 m-long segment at the southern edge of the unit penetrated
through midden fill deposits to a depth of 1.55 m below the surface where a possible floor was
encountered.
In 2013, archaeologists with the Carlsbad Field Office excavated a shovel test in Feature 39 as
part of the effort to obtain chronometric samples from the Permian Basin PA region. The feature
was described as a large charcoal stain, and macrobotanical and radiocarbon samples were
collected from the fill. The samples were submitted to PaleoResearch Institute, and a charred
acorn cap (Quercus sp.) was radiocarbon dated (Scott Cummings and Kováčik 2013:65), yielding
an age estimate of 571±21 BP (PRI 13-050-406; δ13C = -25.34; cal A.D. 1310 to 1418 at 2sigma).
Task 9 of the current scope of work issued by the CFO stipulated that additional investigations be
conducted to define the possible pithouse. During the TRU survey, Feature 39 was recorded on
the surface as a midden area measuring 17 m by 13 m with charcoal-stained deposits and a fairly
high density of cultural materials. Artifacts collected from a 10-m area surrounding the feature
included six lithic flakes, one utilized flake, one metate fragment, and one Ochoa Indented
corrugated sherd.
Part of Feature 39 was included in the GPR survey. A 5-m by 25-m area was cleared of
vegetation from Feature 39 to a few meters west of Feature 7. Although the GPR identified
buried structures below Feature 7 and between Feature 7 and Feature 39, no evidence of a buried
structure was detected around Feature 39. The GPR survey covered the southern part of the
Feature 39 midden area, and subsequent excavations found that the pithouse was located just
outside the GPR survey area.

Chapter Eight
Miscellaneous Excavations

The final task for Feature 39 was to conduct a small excavation in the feature to characterize its
morphology and function. The location of Speth’s Unit 84-1 was estimated by measuring from
Room 7 and from the 1984 datum. Speth’s field notes indicate the test unit was located at a
distance of 74 m and an azimuth of 210 degrees (magnetic north) from the datum. The 2015 test
unit was placed at a distance of 74 m at an angle of 221 degrees (true north, with 11 degrees to
account for declination). The excavation unit measured 7.0 m in length and 0.5 m in width. The
measured location of Speth’s Unit 84-1 was within the boundaries of the unit, and the CFO
shovel test was 2 m from the northern boundary of the unit. The unit was excavated in 1 m by
0.5 m subunits for horizontal control and arbitrary 10 cm levels. A total of 1.35 cubic meters of
fill was screened through ⅛-inch mesh.
Surface soils consisted of eolian sands with variable amounts of caliche nodules. No surface
artifacts were present. A natural deposit of brown sandy loam was present at the northern and
southern margins of the unit to depths of at least 50 cm below the surface. The deposit exposed
in the four northern subunits consisted of a dark brown and gray sandy loam with scattered
charcoal (Figure 8.2). This deposit was encountered at 1 to 2 cm below the surface and extended
to a depth of 40 cm and defined the extent of pithouse Feature 39.
Feature 39 measured 3.69 m in length along the unit exposure and based on that measurement is
assumed to have a circular shape and a diameter of approximately 3.7 m and a floor area of
approximately 10.7 square meters. It was a basin-shaped structure with steep walls and was at
least 38 cm deep. A basin-shaped floor hearth (Feature 39.1) measuring 42 cm in length and
18 cm deep was exposed in the center of the unit profile (Figure 8.2 and Figure 8.3). The fill of
the hearth was a dark charcoal-stained sandy loam with a high density of charcoal.
Both the 1984 and 2015 excavations encountered a pithouse in the same location and the latter
investigations encountered a floor at 38 to 40 cm. Speth’s Unit 84-1 was excavated to a depth of
1.55 m below the surface. The source for this discrepancy is unclear, but it is possible that the
location of Unit 84-1 was offset from the 2015 unit by a meter or two and that Unit 84-1
encountered a second, deeper pithouse below Feature 39. It is also conceivable that Unit 84-1
had exposed a deep subfloor pit of Feature 39.
Artifacts recovered from the natural sediments outside of the pithouse included two flakes, one
marginally retouched lithic tool, one metate fragment, two Ochoa Indented sherds, and 51 pieces
of fire-cracked rock weighting 1.35 kg. In contrast, 161 artifacts were recovered from the narrow
excavation unit in the pithouse fill. The artifact count included 132 flakes, two utilized flakes,
two marginally retouched tools, one tested pebble, three groundstone fragment, a polishing stone,
twelve Ochoa Indented sherds ceramics, two undifferentiated brownware sherds, six bone
fragments, and 77 pieces of fire-cracked rock weighing 1.91 kg. No artifacts were found resting
on the floor of the pithouse.

Feature 52
Feature 52 was identified as a possible burned rock midden in the southern portion of the site
around 140 m south of the LCAS village. It was originally recorded as Feature 7 during survey
of seismic lines across the site (Seymour 2001:170). At that time, Feature 7 was described as a 5m diameter concentration of 100 pieces of burned caliche and fire-cracked rock. As part of the
TRU survey of LA 43414, the feature was designated Feature 52 and was located a few meters to
the north of LMAS Locus 1. The surface manifestation was a 6.0 by 5.2 m distribution of 64
pieces of burned sandstone and burned caliche arranged in a ring around a central pit area of
stained sediments (Figure 8.4). A low density scatter of artifacts was mapped around the feature
during the TRU survey, including a hammerstone and a tested cobble core. Feature 64, a small
hearth, was located a few meters to the northeast.

Chapter Eight
Miscellaneous Excavations

The method for excavating burned rock midden features used for 70 such features on Fort Bliss
Military Reservation (Miller et al. 2011) was utilized for Feature 52. Two cross-trenches were
excavated to examine the ring or midden of discarded burned rock and to locate the central
baking pit. The north-south trench was 6 m in length and 0.5 m wide, and the east-west trench
was 3 m by 0.5 m. The trenches were excavated in 1 m subunits and a total of 6 square meters
(0.77 cubic meters) of fill was removed and screened through ⅛-inch mesh. Subunits were
excavated in a single arbitrary level that averaged 10 to 14 cm in depth. The fill within and
outside the burned rock discard ring consisted of a light tan to pinkish white loam with a very
high proportion of caliche gravels. A total of 74 burned caliche and fire-cracked sandstone
fragments were counted with a weight of 0.61 kg. Artifacts recovered from the excavation
included nine flakes and one marginally retouched tool.
No formal lined baking pit was present but a faint charcoal stain measuring 45 cm diameter and 2
to 5 cm in depth was exposed in the center of the discard ring and cross-trenches (Figure 8.5).
The entire 5.5 liter volume of the fill was collected for a flotation sample, but no charcoal was
present in the light fraction. A unifacial tool recovered from the midden area was submitted for
starch grain and phytolith analysis. No starch grain residues were present, and phytoliths
included several grass species and a dicot tentatively identified as creosote.
Based on the very low burned rock quantities and artifact counts as well as the absence of a
formal baking pit, it can be surmised that the feature was not an intensively used processing
feature and represents a very short-term use of the southern half of LA 43414.

Feature 64
Feature 64 was located 135 m south of the LCAS village area near the northern boundary of
LMAS Locus 1 and 10 meters to the northeast of Feature 59. It is believed to represent Feature 6
defined by the LMAS survey.
On the surface, Feature 64 appeared as a circular 80-cm diameter charcoal stain with several large
pieces of fire-cracked rock (Figure 8.6, top). The feature was bisected, and the southern portion
of the fill was collected as a float sample. Excavation revealed a basin-shaped pit measuring
14 cm deep (Figure 8.6, bottom). A total of 28 pieces of burned rock weighing 5.5 kg was
removed from the bisected half of the feature. Two metate fragments, one round hammerstone,
and an agave knife were recovered from the fill.
A total of 26 liters of fill was recovered and processed. Nine grams of charcoal was collected
from the sample, and 5 grams of Atriplex sp. charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon dating. The
sample yielded an age estimate of 250 ± 30 B.P. (Beta 434523; charred material; δ13C = -11.8
‰), that calibrates from AD 1520 to 1950 at two-sigma, or the equivalent of post-Pueblo through
modern times. The agave knife recovered from the hearth was submitted for starch grain and
phytolith analysis. No starch grain residues were present, and phytoliths included several grass
species and a dicot tentatively identified as creosote.
Feature 64 was a small hearth representing an isolated Protohistoric or Early Historic occupation
of LA 43414. The recovery of several stone tools, including an agave knife and hammerstone,
from the small feature fill suggests it may have been used to process yucca and agave.

Feature 109
Feature 109 was located 27 m to the northwest of the LCAS excavation area. In 2013,
archaeologists with the Carlsbad Field Office excavated a shovel test in Feature 109 as part of the
effort to obtain chronometric samples from the Permian Basin PA region. The feature was
described as a large fire-cracked rock concentration and charcoal stain, and macrobotanical and
radiocarbon samples were collected from the fill. Two radiocarbon samples, a Zea mays cupule
and Prosopis sp. wood charcoal, were submitted to PaleoResearch Institute (Cummings and
Kováčik 2013:65-66). The age estimates are discussed in Chapter Nine.
During the TRU survey, Feature 109 was described as a 2-m diameter scatter of 40 pieces of firecracked rock and burned caliche intermixed with some charcoal-stained sediments. The location
of the CFO shovel test could be seen on the surface. A single piece of debitage was the only
artifact found near the feature.
A 3.0 by 0.5 m excavation unit was opened over the center of the feature and included the
location of the BLM shovel test. The unit was excavated in 1 m subunits for horizontal control
and was excavated in two levels, the first level removing 10-14 cm of overburden soils to expose
the limits of the feature. Soil deposits outside the limits of Feature 109 were very shallow (Figure
8.7). A second 10-cm level was excavated in the southern units, defining a circular pit containing
quantities of burned caliche and charcoal-stained soil. A total of 0.15 cubic meters of fill was
excavated and screened through ⅛-inch mesh.
Feature 109 was a basin-shaped hearth feature or baking pit measuring 90 cm in diameter with a
depth of 10 cm. The base was partially lined with burned rock (see Figure 8.7). A total of 8.5
liters of fill was floated from which 38 grams of light fraction and 2 grams of charcoal were
recovered. No artifacts were recovered from the sample of excavated fill. Artifacts recovered
from the exterior of the pit included two Ochoa indented/corrugated sherds, one flake, one core,
and one utilized flake. In addition, 48 pieces of fire-cracked rock weighing one kilogram were
recorded in Level 1.
Summary of Miscellaneous Excavations
While the primary focus of the 2015 investigations at LA 43414 were concerned with the LCAS
village area and the possible agricultural features to the north, the excavation of pithouse and
burned rock features provided important insights into other dimensions of prehistoric and possible
historic settlement of the larger site.
Feature 39 confirmed the findings of John Speth’s 1984 investigations that pithouse architecture
existed at the site, and the identification of additional pithouse stains during the TRU survey
established that additional pithouse occupations exist along the escarpment edge. Excavation of
three burned rock features revealed that both plant baking pits and small domestic hearths are
present at the site. The existence of plant baking pits indicates that the inhabitants of the
Merchant site baked cacti and succulent plants for food and perhaps for fermented mescal.
Feature 64 yielded a post-pueblo period date and establishes that some areas of LA 43414 were
occupied many years after abandonment of the main village area. When considered as a whole,
the excavation of a small sample of miscellaneous pithouse and burned rock features was highly
productive and demonstrates that LA 43414 is a composite of a long and complex occupational
history.

Chronometrics and Chronology

Chapter Nine
Chronometrics and Chronology
of the Merchant Site
Myles R. Miller

The results of chronometric and relative chronological studies are reviewed in the following
chapter. The chronology of the LCAS excavation area and several features throughout other
areas of LA 43414 is based primarily on radiocarbon dating along with supporting relative
chronological data provided by ceramic wares and projectile point types.
The bulk of the samples are from Pit Structure 1 simply by the fact that the most intensive
excavation work and greatest numbers of features, artifacts, and samples were recovered from
that context. It follows that Pit Structure 1 is the primary focus of the chronometric and
subsistence analyses. Moreover, seven of the eight dates from Pit Structure 1 are from Floor 1
and thus are associated with the first of two floor and occupation episodes of the structure.
Accordingly, it must be kept in mind that the dating and subsistence results are weighted towards
the interior occupation features and post-occupational refuse deposits of the first occupation of a
single large pit structure and may not reflect other habitation areas in the LCAS village area or
throughout the site as a whole. Yet, given that refuse deposits tend to be a composite formation
reflecting behaviors and material culture discard patterns from across a site, it may be assumed
that the samples from Pit Structure 1 represent an acceptable cross-section of the occupational
history of a significant segment of the LCAS excavation area.

Radiocarbon Chronology of LA 43414 and the Merchant Site
Fifteen radiocarbon age estimates have been obtained from LA 43414. Eleven of the dates were
obtained from samples collected during the 2015 excavations, while four dates were part of an
earlier regional chronology project sponsored by the Carlsbad Field Office under the Permian
Basin Programmatic Agreement (Scott Cummings and Kováčik 2013). Eleven dates are from the
Merchant site proper (the LCAS village area) and four are from features located in other loci
across LA 43414. The dates and corresponding information on context and sample type are listed
in Table 9.1. Laboratory report forms are provided in Appendix B.
The 11 dated contexts in the LCAS area include 7 dates from floor features associated with
Floor 1 (lower floor) of Pit Structure 1. One additional date was obtained from the backdirt ring
around the structure by the CFO as part of the above-mentioned regional chronology study. One
date was obtained from the remnant feature or lens in Pit Structure 2, and single dates were
obtained from the baking pit below Refuse Area B and from Feature 39. Dated contexts beyond
the LCAS include a possible agricultural terrace (Feature 108), an isolated hearth (Feature 64),
and two dates from another hearth feature (Feature 109) obtained by the CFO.

Chapter Nine
Chronometrics and Chronology
of the Merchant Site

The fifteen estimates are graphically illustrated in Figure 9.1. The eight dates from Pit
Structure 1, including floor and disturbed backdirt fill contexts, display an exceptionally high
degree of consistency and concordance. The dates were obtained from a variety of sample
materials such as corn cupules and cob fragments, mesquite seeds, and mesquite wood charcoal
from five floor and fill contexts. All of the dates are statistically contemporaneous using the chisquare test of Ward and Wilson (1978), and their calibrated age ranges fall between A.D. 1300
and 1450.
The calibrated age estimate of A.D. 1300 to 1400 from Feature B.1, the baking pit at the base of
Refuse Area B, establishes a minimum age for the formation of the midden deposits overlying the
eastern half of the LCAS area and Pit Structure 2. The date for Feature 39 falls within the same
period as the other LCAS contexts within the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The date
obtained from a charred acorn in isolated hearth Feature 109 located a few meters to the northeast
of the LCAS village also dates to this period, although a second date on mesquite wood charcoal
is a bit earlier.
While the majority of the age estimates fall within the primary occupation period of A.D. 13001450, three contexts have discordant dates. Feature 64 is a small, isolated hearth on the southern
edge of LA 43414. A sample of four-wing saltbush (Atriplex sp.) charcoal from the fill yielded a
2-sigma calibrated age range of A.D. 1530 to 1950 with a calibrated intercept of A.D. 1650 and a
median of the calibrated age range of A.D. 1680. It is likely that the feature represents a brief and
low-intensity Protohistoric or early Historic occupation of the prominent landform of Grama
Ridge.
The age estimates from Feature 108 and Feature 2.1 are more problematic. The 2-sigma
calibrated age range of A.D. 880-1010 from Feature 108, a possible agricultural terrace, is much
earlier than anticipated given the presumed association with the agricultural village excavated in
the LCAS area. The latter years of the calibrated age range (circa A.D. 1010) are a minimum of
three centuries earlier than the earliest possible occupation of the LCAS village at circa A.D.
1300. The sample material was a very small fragment of unidentified wood, and it is possible
that the age is biased by old wood effects. Old wood may be a potential source of bias given that
fuel and construction wood is a premium resource on the dry, mostly treeless environment of
Grama Ridge. An old wood offset can be seen in the paired dates from Feature 109. The paired
samples of wood charcoal (695 +/- 21 B.P.) and acorn (546 +/- 22 B.P.) are not statistically
contemporaneous (df=2, t=23.98, critical x2=3.8), demonstrating an age offset of approximately
150 years for the wood charcoal. However, this offset is not as pronounced as the 300+ year
disjunction between the observed and expected age of Feature 108. Moreover, no old wood bias
is present in the three samples from floor Feature 1.3 of Pit Structure 1. Given the small sample
of cases from the Merchant site, it is not possible to come to a reliable statement regarding
systematic old wood effects. Diagnostic artifacts from Feature 108 include a mixed collection of
late and early points (Palmillas and Harrell-style forms) and ceramics (Ochoa and
Jornada/Roswell Brown), and thus the chronology of this feature remains uncertain.
On the other side of the temporal scale, the age estimate of 160 +/- 30 B.P. from wood charcoal
recovered in the remnant floor feature of Pit Structure 2 is thought to be far too young. The 2sigma calibrated age range is A.D. 1660 to 1950. The segment of the dendrochronological
calibration curve of this period has several inversions (or is “wiggly”), and thus the 160 B.P. age
has multiple calibrated intercepts of A.D. 1680, 1735, 1755, 1760, 1800, 1935, and modern. The
median of the calibrated age range is A.D. 1780. Because of the wide spread of the intercepts and
calibrated age range, there are little to no statistical grounds to argue that any specific occupation
has greater probability than another, and the true calendar age of the charcoal sample lies
anywhere between A.D. 1680 and 1950.

clearly out of sequence with the dates from Pit Structure 1 and Refuse Area B. Several scenarios
ranging from laboratory errors to modern redeposition of charcoal can be presented to explain this
discrepancy, none of which is entirely satisfactory. Ruling out laboratory contamination (at
Versar) or laboratory measurement error (at Beta Analytic), it is felt that two possible processes
or events could have led to the age disjunction.

Both explanations involve redeposition of modern or historic charcoal through a combination of
the extensive looting and redeposition of deposits within the structure and the surrounding
midden deposits. Noting that tin food cans were found throughout the backfilled deposits in both
pit structures, it is possible that the looters or LCAS members made cooking fires during their
visits and charcoal from one of the fires was tossed into or washed into the exposed excavation.
The laminated sand deposits in the bottom of the structure include lenses of fine charcoal
sediments with occasional flecks and fragments.
The LCAS excavation took place in 1960 and the destruction of the floor by looters occurred in
1964 or 1965. Fuel wood obtained from living or recently deceased trees and shrubs would have
a pronounced “bomb carbon” signature from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons
beginning in the 1950s (Sarachine Falso and Buchholz 2013; de Vries 1958). In other words, any
radiocarbon measurement from a sample of wood or wood charcoal from the early 1960s would
be in excess of the modern 1950 standard, demonstrating the presence of bomb carbon. It is
possible that deadwood was collected from trees and shrubs that had ceased metabolism and
intake of 14C, thus yielding an historic age range.
A second scenario is that charcoal from a Protohistoric or Historic occupation within the LCAS
village area was backfilled or backwashed into the base of the structure. As discussed and
illustrated in Chapter Five, the midden and occupation deposits of Refuse Area B around and
above Pit Structure 2 were severely disturbed by looting. Photographs show most of the refuse
area dug to depths of 50 cm or more and backdirt and screen spoil piles throughout. Perhaps
another small post-A.D. 1450 occupation such as noted for Feature 64 existed in Refuse Area B,
and charcoal from that deposit was mixed into the base of Pit Structure 2 when it was looted.
Of course, a third explanation is that Pit Structure 2 was cleaned of roof and wall fall and natural
sediments and was briefly occupied 200 to 400 years after the main village area was abandoned
between A.D. 1350 and 1450. There is no artifactual evidence to support or refute this. One of
the recommendations for future work at the Merchant site is to obtain additional dates from
specimens of animal bone recovered from the fill and backdirt deposits.
Returning to the primary location and interval of settlement, the age range of A.D. 1300–1450
helps securely place the LCAS village in the Ochoa phase, or the analogous El Paso and Lincoln
phases of the Jornada region to the west. However, this 150-year-long calibrated age range lacks
precision, and therefore some attempts were made to refine the age of occupation. Unfortunately,
attempts to refine and narrow the occupation age are hindered by the fact that the prehistoric
occupation of the Merchant site occurred during a segment of the calibration curve with a major
inversion, or “‘wiggle.” The presence of the large inversion between 560 and 600 B.P. means that
essentially any conventional radiocarbon age falling within that interval will yield multiple
intercepts and form pronounced bimodal calibrated probability distributions (Figure 9.2).
Calibration of even the very precise dates with standard errors of +/- 21 years, such as the date
from the backdirt ring (PRI-13-050-407, see Table 9.1), will result in two probability curves
(Figure 9.2, inset).
The spread of age ranges across multiple intercepts creates several obstacles for advanced
statistical procedures. Nevertheless, an attempt was made to narrow the age ranges and inferred
period of occupation through the application of Bayesian statistical methods (Buck et al. 1991,
1992). In order to understand the potential of a Bayesian approach, some background to the
statistical theory is in order, particularly since it represents a fundamentally different, yet
compatible approach to statistical interpretation. The fundamentals of the theorem were outlined
in a paper presented by Thomas Bayes, a Presbyterian Minister, in 1763. The publication of his
paper An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances was posthumously
presented by a friend two years after his death (see Jeffreys 1973).

Bayes Theorem is mathematically expressed by the formula:
𝜌(𝜃 |𝒳) =

ρ(𝒳 |𝜃)𝜌(𝜃)
∫ρ(𝒳 |θ)ρ(𝜃)𝒹𝜃

While the thetas and X symbols appear rather daunting at first, the literal translation of the
formula is actually simple and intuitive:
P(parameters | data) = P(data | parameters) x P(parameters)
P(data)

Or in plain language: Posterior beliefs (probabilities) = standardized likelihood X prior beliefs
(probabilities).

Chronometrics and Chronology

In general, the Bayesian approach differs from classical or formal inferential statistics by the
inclusion of some prior knowledge or beliefs that are used to modify probabilities. The Bayesian
approach offers a means of evaluating series of age estimates within a robust and consistent
statistical framework and can be thought of, in essence, as what Buck et al. (1991:819) term a
"disciplined uncertainty accounting" that combines archaeological, chronological, and statistical
information into a coherent model. Bayesian models and analyses have been applied to
chronometric studies in the region, including establishing phase boundaries and refining
occupation periods for El Paso Phase pueblos (Miller 2005; Miller and Graves 2012; Miller et al.
2009), partitioning and defining occupational intervals at a multicomponent terminal Late
Archaic and early Mesilla village (Graves et al. 2016), and are currently being used to revise and
refine chronologies for the Mimbres region of south-central New Mexico (Miller and Nash 2016).
The eight radiocarbon dates from Pit Structure 1 were analyzed using a Sequential Phase model
(after Buck et al. 1994) that assumes the occupation of the lower floor of Pit Structure 1 was a
single episode with no overlap with other occupational periods and that an unknown period of
time separated it from other periods (see also Bronk Ramsey 2009). The original calibrated
radiocarbon age distributions are the prior probabilities incorporated into the analysis. The model
establishes the mathematical constraints (the prior knowledge of the ordering of events), allowing
for the temporal boundaries of the phase period to be estimated. By applying the prior knowledge
of the ordering of events, the posterior probabilities can be derived and the beginning and ending
boundaries of the phase can be estimated. Owing to the nature of radiocarbon sampling
populations, probabilities, calibration curves, and other factors, the calibrated age ranges of
multiple age estimates will overestimate the true calendar span of the target archaeological event
being dated (Bayliss et al. 2011). The use of Bayesian methods and mathematical procedures
takes the sampling phenomena into account to arrive at a more refined probabilistic estimate of
the true age span of the group of dates.
Note that the use of “phase” in Bayesian models does not specifically refer to the conventional
definition of an archaeological or chronological time period, but rather defines a group of dated
events that are related to each other but for which there is no assumption of chronological
ordering. In the present case, the dates from the floor features of Pit Structure 1 are a group of
dated events that are related to each other, but there is no assumption that any feature predates or
postdates another feature. There is no assumption, for example, that Feature 1.3 is older or
younger than Feature 1.4.
The sequential phase model and results are illustrated in Figure 9.3 and are listed in Table 9.2.
Two distributions are shown for the dates in Figure 9.3: the lightly shaded areas are the prior
probabilities (calibrated 2-sigma distributions) and the darker shaded areas represent the modelled
posterior probability distributions based on the Bayesian calculations. The first analysis found
that the date obtained on a mesquite seed from Feature 1.3 (Beta 434664) had a poor agreement
index value with the overall model. The date was marked as an outlier for the second analysis.
The agreement indices for the second analysis (model = 91.6; overall = 94.0) are listed in Table
9.2 and confirm that the model has a high degree of internal consistency.
The series of Bayesian analyses include Phase Boundaries (beginning and end) and estimates for
the First and Last dates. The Interval is an estimate of duration of the phase, taking into account
sampling biases and an assumption that not all related events were dated (the 8 dates represent
only a fraction of the potential dated events associated with the feature). In contrast, Span is an
estimate of the duration for the actual series of age estimates from the dated events. Median
values are included in the table of results but the median dates constitute only a small fraction of
the overall distributions and accordingly should not be accorded much weight or significance for
interpretations.

While it was hoped that the Bayesian analysis would narrow the age range of the lower floor of
Pit Structure 1, it is evident that the effects of the calibration curve inversions create an
insurmountable obstacle. The phase boundary probability distributions show the same bimodal
distributions as the original calibrated probability distributions. The Bayesian analysis offers a
slight improvement in the probabilistic estimates for the phase boundaries as well as for several
of the individual dates. However, the radiocarbon chronology for Pit Structure 1 can only place
the occupation of the feature within a general time frame of A.D. 1300 to 1450.
In terms of age estimates with reasonably secure contexts, the radiocarbon chronology for Pit
Structure 1 is actually a chronology of the first occupation associated with Floor 1 and prior to the
remodeling and addition of Floor 2. One of the eight dates is from a charred mesquite seed
recovered from the LCAS backdirt ring. The date is contemporaneous with the other seven age
estimates, but it lacks a secure context and could have been unearthed from any of the refuse
deposits, floor fills, or floor features associated with either occupation interval of the pit structure.
In the absence of absolute radiocarbon dates from the second floor, relative age estimates based
on ceramics and projectile points from the upper and lower occupations will have to be examined.

Ceramic Chronology
Leslie describes a rather remarkable range of imported ceramic wares and types from the LCAS
excavations. The variety of ceramic types recovered during the excavations of the early 1960s
included Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Redware, and El Paso Polychrome from the
northern and southern Jornada regions and Chupadera Mesa, Medio Period types from northcentral Chihuahua, Roosevelt Redware (formerly Salado Redware) from southwestern New
Mexico and southeastern Arizona, and Rio Grande Glazeware from northcentral New Mexico.
Most of the ceramic wares and types described by Leslie were also identified in the assemblages
recovered from the backdirt and refuse deposits investigated during the 2015 fieldwork. The
exceptions are that no Playas Redware, Gila Polychrome, or Rio Grande Glaze A sherds were
found during the recent fieldwork. Given the similarities between Glaze A and Lincoln Blackon-red, it is possible, though unlikely, that some of the sherds from the LCAS excavations were
misidentified, but that cannot be confirmed since the LCAS collections were lost. Jornada
Brownware is not included among the ceramic wares in Leslie’s lists. As with Glaze A and
Lincoln Black-on-red, it is possible that Roswell Brown sherds are actually Jornada Brownware
(Wiseman 2004; 2012).
The ceramic assemblages and the distributions and associations of ceramic wares are reviewed in
greater detail in Chapter Twelve and in the summary chapter of the report. The present review is
concerned with the relative chronological information provided by ceramics. Table 9.3 lists the
most current estimates of the production ages for the various wares and types. Considered in its
entirety, the imported assemblage is typical of fourteenth and early fifteenth century settlements
throughout southern New Mexico.
Ceramic types with production periods predating A.D. 1300, indicating either an earlier
occupation or sherds that were scavenged and recycled by the inhabitants of the Merchant site,
are notable by their almost complete absence. Pueblo settlements in the Jornada region usually
have a scattering of earlier sherds such as Mimbres Black-on-white, Viejo Period textured and
decorated types, early Cibola whitewares, or El Paso Brown or Bichrome from nearby pithouse
occupations or deposited through recycling behaviors. With the possible exceptions of early
varieties of Chupadero Black-on-white and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta dating as early as A.D.
1150, the general absence of ceramic sherds pre-dating A.D. 1300 is noteworthy.

On the other end of the occupation interval for the Merchant site, ceramic types postdating A.D.
1450 are also rare, and in each case the production period for the type spans both the 1300–1450
and post-1450 time periods. In other words, none of the ceramic wares from the site have
production periods that occurred exclusively after A.D. 1450. The manufacture of Glaze A,
Chupadero Black-on-white, and Lincoln Black-on-red may have continued for a few decades
after A.D. 1450, but the primary period of production for each type occurred between A.D. 1300
and 1450. Moreover, the post-A.D. 1450 terminal production dates for these types have never
been conclusively established. In summary, there is little to no ceramic evidence for occupation
of LA 43414 and the LCAS village area before A.D. 1300 or after A.D. 1450.

Projectile Point Chronology
Leslie describes an extraordinary count of 1,567 projectile points from the LCAS excavations.
Using his relatively objective system based on morphological attributes, Leslie classified the
points as Type 1 and Type 2 (Figure 9.4. Leslie’s line drawings of the major projectile point
types he identified at the Merchant site.) and variants of those types with letter designations (A,
B, C, D). Considering the most common types of Leslie’s classification found at the site, 854
(54.6 percent) of the points were assigned to Types 2B-C that represent minor morphological
variants of point styles generally identified as Washita and Types 2D-E that represent minor
variants of the Harrell style. Another 545 (35.0 percent) of the points were assigned to Types 1AC which describe several minor variants of the Fresno or Cottonwood Triangular type. Two
subtypes representing other conventional stylistic types were identified. Eighty-two (5.2 percent)
of the points were assigned to Type 2F which is similar to the Toyah type, and 31 (2.0 percent)
points were classified as Type 1D which resembles the Garza type but may also be a simple
basal-notched preform. The remaining 50 points include a variety of miscellaneous types, most
of which are associated with earlier time periods and were probably scavenged and recycled.
The points recovered during the 2015 investigations include several of the variants of
Fresno/Cottonwood and Washita (Figure 9.5), although the proportions of the major types
differed from Leslie’s tabulations. Basal-notched Harrell (Leslie’s Type 2D-E) points were less
common than Washita types (Leslie’s Type 2B-C). The projectile point assemblages are
examined in greater detail in Chapter Twelve. As with the preceding ceramic discussion, the
present discussion is concerned with the relative chronological information provided by projectile
points.
As noted for the ceramic assemblage, the three major point types recovered from the Merchant
site, Fresno/Cottonwood, Washita, and Harrell, are ubiquitous among pithouse and pueblo
settlements dating from A.D. 1300 to 1450 across southern and southeastern New Mexico. These
types comprise the majority of projectiles at Henderson pueblo, Bloom Mound, and the Fox Place
site near Roswell (Adler and Speth 2004; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wiseman 2002) and the
Block Lookout and Phillips sites in the Capitan Mountains (Kelley 1984: 212, 275), as well as
Sacramento Pueblo in the southern Sacramento Mountains (Miller and Graves 2012).
Fresno points (Leslie Types 1A-C) are triangular forms with straight, concave, or slightly convex
bases and often have slightly expanding haft areas that are wider than the base of the blade (see
Figures 9.4 and 9.5). Whether the Fresno/Cottonwood type represents a preform stage in the
manufacture of Harrell and other small triangular points or was a true projectile point has been
the subject of debate (Adler and Speth 2004; Whittaker 1987). Several of the specimens in the
Sacramento Pueblo collection had broken tips with impact fractures, indicating their use as
projectiles, but others were relatively crude, thick and unshaped and could have been preforms
(Miller and Graves 2012).
The second most common type is a small, triangular point with side notches and a straight or
slightly concave base (Leslie Types 2B-C and 2D-E). These types have been designated as
Washita and Harrell (Bell 1958; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm and Krieger 1954; Turner and
Hester 1993) and Desert Side Notched or Pueblo Side Notched (Justice 2002). In addition, the
Toyah type (Leslie’s Type 2F) is another variant with a small basal notch and serrated blade.
These two projectile point forms have been identified as Late Prehistoric or Late Formative
period types in the western Jornada, but it is important to note that Harrell and Toyah may have
later dates across the southern Plains. A spatial and contextual analysis of the different point
forms is reviewed in Chapter Thirteen.

Chronometrics and Chronology
of the Merchant Site

In the Jornada region, chronometric dates associated with the points have been compiled by Tim
Graves (Graves et al. 2012). This database is proving useful for refining age estimates for certain
projectile point types in the Jornada region (Miller 2016). Over 250 Fresno/Cottonwood
Triangular points are listed, 35 of which are associated with absolute chronometric dates. The
dated examples range from as early as 400 B.C. to as late as A.D. 1680. A closer inspection of the
database does find that 80 percent of the points of this type are associated with Late Doña Ana
and El Paso phase occupations in the southern Jornada and Late Glencoe and Lincoln phase
settlements in the northern Jornada and thus have an inferred production range of circa A.D. 1150
to 1450. It is relatively certain that many of the pre-A.D. 1150 and post-A.D. 1450 dates were due
to mixed, multicomponent contexts, artifact scavenging, or because certain Fresno points were
preforms for other types.
A total of 322 Harrell/Washita/Pueblo Side Notched points are documented. Given the
association of such points with pithouse and pueblo settlements, it is surprising that only 20 are
associated with absolute chronometric dates. The age distribution of this type is similar to that of
the Fresno points discussed above, with over 80 percent of the specimens dating to between A.D.
1000 and 1450.
Unlike the ceramic assemblage, a comparatively small and minor number of point types predating
A.D. 1300 were recovered from the Merchant site. A few Livermore points and several sidenotched and corner-notched dart points were found. The dart points were mostly Late Archaic
forms and were probably scavenged from long abandoned sites across southeast New Mexico.
These earlier types account for a fraction of the projectile point assemblage, and over 97 percent
of the point types are typical of Late Prehistoric occupations throughout New Mexico, Texas, and
the Great Basin.

Dating the Merchant Site
Radiocarbon age estimates, ceramic production dates, and projectile point dates mutually support
and corroborate an inferred fourteenth and early fifteenth century occupation for the LCAS
village area of LA 43414. The summed probability distribution of the radiocarbon dates (Figure
9.6) displays two pronounced bimodal peaks between A.D. 1300 and 1450. Ceramic wares and
projectile point types recovered from the domestic rooms, pit structures, and refuse deposits of
the LCAS village area consistently date to the same period. The single discordant age estimate
from the heavily disturbed base of Pit Structure 2 may have resulted from charcoal from an
unknown source having been redeposited at the base of the structure through the combined effects
of widespread looting, backfilling, and natural infilling with looted deposits.
A minor Protohistoric occupation was identified through excavation and dating of Feature 64 at
the far southern edge of LA 43414. The small, isolated hearth feature and small collection of
associated artifacts reflects a very low-intensity occupation. The early outlier date of A.D. 8801010 is associated with the possible agricultural feature or house remains designated as Feature
108. Diagnostic projectile points and ceramics from the excavation have production spans that
include both A.D. 500 to 1000 and A.D. 1300 to 1450. Lacking additional excavation data or
absolute dates, the chronology of Feature 108 remains unresolved. The chronology, site
formation, and occupational history of the Merchant site is examined in further detail in Chapter
Thirteen.

Chapter Ten
Plant and Pollen Remains from the
Merchant Site
Phil Dering and Susan J. Smith

The results of analysis of plant subsistence at the Merchant site are reviewed in the following
chapter. Subsistence analyses include macrobotanical plant remains identified in flotation
samples and pollen recovered from soil samples. Additionally, artifacts and soils from two
isolated hearth features were submitted for phytolith and starch residue analysis.
The analyses yielded several important insights, the most significant of which is the high sample
ubiquity values for maize and mesquite seeds. Maize sample ubiquity was high among both
macrobotanical and pollen samples, establishing that the inhabitants of the LCAS village area
were farmers in addition to game hunters and that maize and perhaps other cultigens were grown
in fields in the vicinity of the settlement.
It should be noted, however, that the results of the macrobotanical and pollen studies are
conditioned to a degree by sampling biases. The remedial excavations within the LCAS village
area were restricted to backdirt deposits in and around the two pit structures and limited test
excavations in two midden deposits and a pithouse. Excavations outside the LCAS village
focused on two possible agricultural features and three isolated burned rock features. The
primary focus of excavations in pit structures and agricultural features is reflected in the contexts
of the subsistence samples submitted for analysis: 11 of 16 (69 percent) flotation samples are
from subfloor and fill contexts in Pit Structure 1 and 10 of the 13 (77 percent) pollen samples are
from backhoe trench profiles or excavation units in the agricultural features. The remaining three
pollen samples are from subfloor contexts in Pit Structure 1. No excavations were conducted in
or around the domestic rooms, and accordingly subsistence samples from rooms are notable by
their absence.
Despite the contextual bias of the subsistence samples, it should also be noted that several of the
flotation samples represent intermixed refuse deposits from the domestic rooms. The backdirt
deposits in and around Pit Structure 1 were once part of the stratified fill deposits inside the
structure that included several layers of domestic refuse disposal and one probable ritual deposit.
Several small areas of white ash, charcoal, and charred plant remains that were likely the emptied
contents of domestic hearths were noted in the denser strata of refuse in Pit Structure 1 (see
Chapter Six). So while the context of the samples is biased towards the pit structure, the actual
content of the samples may be considered a reasonably representative sample of charred plant
remains across the settlement.

Plant Remains from the Merchant Site
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an assessment of the botanical assemblages from the
Merchant Site, LA 43414. Both flotation and macrobotanical samples were submitted for
analysis. The data will be utilized to assess the nature and condition of the plant remains from
these sites and provide some evidence for plant utilization and local environmental conditions.
Methods
Flotation is a method of recovering organic remains from archeological sediments by using water
to separate heavy or soluble inorganic particles from plant parts and small animal bone. The
material floating to the surface is called the light fraction, and this is caught on a fine mesh screen
or strainer. The material that sinks to the bottom is the heavy fraction, and it is also caught on a
fine mesh screen. Most of the soil including clay and silt is suspended in water, passes through
the screens, and is discarded. In most cases, only the light fraction is submitted for analysis after
the heavy fraction has been examined for plant materials.
Macrobotanical samples are carbonized plant remains that are separated from the rest of the
archaeological material by hand. Macrobotanical samples are collected either from an
excavator’s screen or are point-collected and plotted individually in the field. They are often
labeled 14C or radiocarbon samples.
The analysis follows standard archaeobotanical laboratory procedures. The light fraction of each
flotation sample is passed through a nested set of screens of 4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, and 0.450 mm
mesh and examined for charred material, which is separated for identification. Plant remains are
sorted into two categories: wood fragments and seed/fruit fragments including maize or agave
parts when present. Identification of carbonized wood is accomplished by using the snap
technique, examining the transverse section of the fragments at 8 to 45 magnifications with a
hand lens or a binocular stereo-microscope, and comparing the material to samples in the
archaeobotanical herbarium. All seed identifications are made using seed manuals and reference
collections at Shumla Archeobotanical Services. Only charred plant material is included in the
analysis because uncarbonized material is consumed by insects, fungi, and bacteria and does not
survive more than a few years in the deposits of open sites.
Up to 25 wood charcoal fragments large enough to be manipulated are examined and identified
from each flotation sample. Fragments smaller than 2 or 3 mm cannot be manipulated and are
usually placed in the indeterminate category. When a sample contains more than 25 fragments,
the rest of the material is scanned to make sure that no other taxa are present. Fragment counts
and mass of wood charcoal for each sample are presented in tabular format.
Seed or maize fragments are presented as particle counts and presence values. Presence value, or
ubiquity, is defined as the percentage of all analyzed samples, both productive (with seeds) and
unproductive (wood charcoal only or no charcoal), in which a particular taxon is present. This
was the primary method utilized to evaluate the occurrence of the major food plant resources
identified in the samples.
Presence value provides a means of determining how widespread a taxon is throughout the
samples recovered from a site; however, its utility is limited when only a few samples are
analyzed. For example, if mesquite pod fragments were noted in five of 20 samples, the presence
value is 25 percent. If they are noted in only four of 20 samples, then the value is 20 percent, so
the values change in 5 percent increments. If only four samples were analyzed, and mesquite is
recovered in one sample, the presence value is 25 percent. If mesquite is found in two samples
the presence value rises to 50 percent, so the values change in 25 percent increments, greatly
reducing the resolution and utility of the dataset. For this reason, presence value has not been
utilized in studies with fewer than five samples.

Disturbance Indicators: Sample content may be affected by various biological disturbance
factors, including insect or small mammal activity and plant root growth. In an effort to assess
this impact, the amounts of insect parts, termite pellets, gastropods, leaves, mammal remains
(including fecal pellets), and modern uncharred seeds are estimated for each flotation sample.
These estimates are reported on a scale of 1-5 (+), 6-25 (++), 26-50 (+++), and over 50 (++++).
In this study, disturbance indicators included lagomorph feces (pellets), uncarbonized seeds,
roots, and insect parts.
Results and Discussion
Results of the analysis are presented in Table 10.1 and Table 10.2. Table 10.1 lists the sample
proveniences along with seed taxa counts and seed counts from each sample. Identifications and
counts of plant material recovered from each sample, including the macrobotanical samples,
appear in Table 10.2.
Recovery of charred plant material in the flotation samples was variable. The total charcoal in
each sample varies from no charred plant material in Feature 108, to 8.5 g in Feature 1.9, an ash
pit. Disturbance indicators are abundant. Roots and insect parts constitute the majority of the
disturbance indicators, and four samples contain uncharred seeds.
Mesquite seeds and maize fragments are present in both flotation and macrobotanical samples. A
single sample contains a yucca seed. Sixteen samples contain mesquite wood fragments, and nine
samples contain saltbush-type wood charcoal.
Feature Types
Ashpits: Light fractions were examined from Features 1.6 and 1.9. The sample from Feature 1.6
contains both mesquite seed fragments and wood from mesquite, saltbush, and ocotillo. Feature
1.9 contains both mesquite seeds and maize fragments. Both mesquite and saltbush wood were
recovered from this feature. The ocotillo wood most likely came from burned structural
elements, while the mesquite may be structural or a fuel wood. The charred seeds and maize
fragments likely were discarded from processing activities, although maize cobs may have been
used as fuel.
Postholes: Plant materials from three postholes were examined in this analysis (Features 1.5, 1.8,
and 1.14). These were relatively productive samples, containing 10 mesquite seed fragments and
a single maize cupule. Wood types include ocotillo, mesquite, and saltbush.
Floor hearths: Two samples from floor hearths, Features 1.2 and 1.4, produced some interesting
results. The sample from Feature 1.2 does not contain any seeds or maize fragments, but it does
contain the only example of juniper wood recovered from the site. Feature 1.4 has more maize
fragments than any other sample in this analysis. Additionally, these samples contain a mix of
ocotillo, mesquite, and saltbush wood types.

Storage Pit: Storage pits seldom contain archaeological materials in their original context, unless
a catastrophic fire occurred while the structure was still in use. The plant materials recovered
from Feature 1.3, including maize cupules, mesquite seeds, and a single yucca seed, likely were
deposited after the pit was emptied. Wood types include saltbush and mesquite.
Cultural Lenses and Other Features: Features 1.12 and 1.13 contain an abundance of mesquite
wood. In addition to a concentration of carbonized mesquite wood, the samples from Feature 39
and Room 1 contain mesquite seed fragments. The plant material from the Feature 64 light
fraction is almost completely composed of saltbush wood. The remaining features contain an
abundance of the mesquite wood type, most likely the primary wood used in the vertical elements
of the structure.
Conclusions
The relative abundance of mesquite seeds and maize and the presence of yucca seed provide
evidence of a mixed gathering/farming economy typical of the region. As seen below in Table
10.3, the ubiquity values for mesquite are higher than for maize. The mesocarp of mesquite fruits
was pounded into meal or flour, and the seeds and endocarps were usually discarded (Bell and
Castetter 1937; Felger 1977). Therefore, mesquite bean processing may have occurred at this site
during late summer.

A single yucca seed recovered from Feature 1.3 would have been discarded during processing.
The seed is from a fleshy fruited yucca, possibly datil (Yucca baccata). Datil, or banana yucca, is
a thick-leaved yucca that produces an edible fruit. The fruits were harvested and either roasted or
baked. After baking, the seeds were stripped from the fruit and the remaining flesh was pounded
into a pulp, shaped into flatcakes, and sun-dried (Bell and Castetter 1941; Castetter and Opler
1936).

One plant species, in part notable by its absence in the present study, is Quercus sp. acorn
fragments. Leslie noted that charred acorn fragments (husks and caps) were recovered in several
locations in domestic rooms and the fill of Pit Structures 1 and 2, and a charred acorn was also
recovered from the test pit excavated by CFO archaeologists in Feature 39. Leslie noted that the
acorns from the refuse fills of the structures were mostly restricted to small deposits of charcoal
and white ash that were probably the discarded contents of domestic hearths. Therefore their
absence among the current suite of samples may be due to the fact that our features did not
include the emptied and discarded contents of domestic hearths.
Much of the carbonized wood, especially the mesquite, may be from vertical elements in the
pithouse structure. Ocotillo, recovered from three samples, also was likely part of the structure.
Saltbush, which is unusually abundant in some samples, may have been used to cover the
framework. The high presence value of mesquite seeds and the abundance of mesquite wood
charcoal suggest that mesquite was plentiful in the immediate surroundings of the site.

Analysis of Pollen Samples from the Merchant Site
Thirteen pollen samples were analyzed from the Merchant Site (LA 43414). The samples were
submitted in two batches, the first consisting of five samples from backhoe trench profiles during
the first investigation of possible agricultural features; the second batch consisting of eight
samples obtained during hand excavations in Pit Structure 1 and the possible agricultural Feature
108. Modern vegetation around the site is a mixture of grassland and shrubs where creosote
(Larrea tridentata) is dominant with mesquite (Prosopis sp.), soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), oak
(Quercus), and small cacti. Dune sands in the northeastern portion of the site add a separate
microhabitat element.
Methods
Sediment samples were processed at the Palynology Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College
Station, Texas, utilizing protocols developed and tested by Dr. Vaughn Bryant, Jr. The Texas
A&M procedure is summarized below.
Subsamples (10 grams) were taken from the sample bags and spiked with a known concentration
(18,853 spores) of club moss (Lycopodium) to monitor degradation from laboratory chemicals
and to enable pollen concentration calculations. Pretreatment steps included sieving to remove
coarse material (rocks, roots, charcoal etc.) and hydrochloric acid to dissolve carbonates. Next,
samples were treated with hydrofluoric acid to reduce silicates, followed by a density separation
in zinc bromide. Lignin and other organic plant material were oxidized by a chemical procedure
called acetolysis, and the residues transferred to vials and stored in glycerol.
Drops from the extracted samples were spread and sealed onto microscope slides and analyzed on
a Reichert Microstar compound microscope at 400x magnification. For each sample, pollen
grains were counted to a sum of 200 grains or greater and then the entire slide was scanned at
253

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

100x magnification to record additional taxa. At 100x magnification, pollen grains larger than
approximately 30 µm (0.03 mm) can be identified, which includes maize, cotton, squash, and
agave as well as native cacti, pines, and some herbs. Pollen identifications were made to the
lowest taxonomic level possible based on published keys (Fægri and Iversen 1989; Kapp et al.
2000). Aggregates (clumps of the same pollen type) were counted as one grain per occurrence,
and the taxon and largest aggregate recorded separately. For example, for a sample containing
two aggregates of grass pollen, one of four grains and the second of eight grains, the data would
be entered as “Grass Aggregates 2(8)”.
Three numerical measures were calculated from the data: pollen percentages, taxon richness, and
pollen concentration. Percentages represent the relative importance of each taxon in a sample
([pollen counted/sample pollen sum]*100), and taxon richness is the number of different pollen
types identified per sample. Pollen concentration is an estimate of the absolute abundance or
density of pollen contained in sample sediments. Concentrations are calculated by taking the
ratio of the pollen count to the tracer count and multiplying by the initial tracer concentration.
Dividing this result by the sample weight yields the number of pollen grains per gram of sediment
abbreviated gr/gm.
Two rare and unique pollen types were identified. Spectacle pod (Brassicaceae Family,
Dimorphocarpa sp.) pollen is separated from other mustard family grains on the basis of five or
more equatorial colpi (stephanocolpate) and a tectate, coarse-reticulate exine. This grain
morphology is similar to the mint family (Lamiaceae family) and pepperweed (Lesquerella
family) (another mustard), except the majority of mint and pepperweed grains display finereticulate exines. The second unique pollen taxon is honeysuckle (Caprifoliaceae Family,
Lonicera sp.) identified from a single grain in one sample (Feature 1.12). A microphotograph of
the relatively large pollen grain (longest dimension 70 µm,) shows the diagnostic short tricolpate
apertures crossed by transverse thinning and the echinate to clavate exine (Figure 10.1).

Plant and Pollen Remains from the Merchant Site

Defining the Economic Pollen Signature, Analytical Criteria
Evaluation of economic pollen representation is based on recognizing when abundance exceeds
expectations of natural background pollen rain tempered by knowledge of the function, integrity,
and history of sampled contexts (Adams and Smith 2011). For the majority of resources
interpreted in this analysis, ethnobotanical significance is further defined by pollination ecology
(wind or insect) and ethnographic accounts documenting cultural use. Pollen from windpollinated plants is more likely to become incorporated in surface soils, than insect-pollinated
species, because the plant’s reproductive strategy (anemophily) is to produce abundant pollen
dispersed by wind currents. Insect-pollinated plants (entomophily) produce small quantities of
pollen carried plant-to-plant by insects.
Results
The results are presented as pollen percentages by taxon in Table 10.4, Table 10.5, and Table
10.6, along with detailed sample provenience information, summary measures of pollen
concentration and taxon richness, and pollen aggregate data. Thirty-one taxa were identified and
are listed by common and scientific names organized by interpreted ethnobotanical and ecological
categories. Discussion of individual feature results is presented below.
Pit Structure 1: Pit Structure 1 was labeled a pithouse or room by the LCAS volunteer excavators
working at the site in the 1960s, but the 6-foot-deep structure depression punched through hard
caliche, contained interior artifacts, a fill stratum consisting of animal bone, and other features
indicating that it functioned as something more than a domestic structure. Three features were
sampled for pollen (Table 10.4): dirt encasing a mano found inside a subfloor storage pit
(Feature 1.3), an intact floor hearth that contained fire-cracked rock and burned clay (Feature
1.4), and sediment brushed from a metate fragment found in a shallow depression with floor fill
(Feature 1.12) along the northcentral margin of the structure. The floor surface capping Feature
1.12 had been plastered.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Maize pollen was recovered from all three samples and at moderate values of one percent in the
floor pit and hearth. Lily family, which probably reflects local yucca, was identified only in the
floor pit sample; cattail and an unusual occurrence of honeysuckle pollen were documented from
the metate fragment in Feature 1.12. These three native taxa were not found in sediment
collected from Feature 108 or from the off-site control sample and are interpreted as economic
resources brought into Pit Structure 1. The presence of cattail suggests a local water source, such
as a spring or permanent to semi-permanent seep that provided at least seasonal habitat for cattail.
The association of cattail with Feature 1.12 might also relate water to mud used in plastering the
floor surface. It is also possible that the presence of maize and cattail pollen relate to ritual use of
the structure.
The honeysuckle pollen identified from Feature 1.12 is a first for archaeobotanical records from
the region, based on pollen data from southern New Mexico (author’s data) and a review of
macrobotanical and phytolith data from the New Mexico Permian Basin (Cummings and Kováčik
2013). Honeysuckle is an insect-pollinated plant, and it is unlikely pollen entered Feature 1.12
sediments through natural vectors. Modern distribution maps indicate there are three possible
species with ranges across the Southwest from western Texas to Arizona (U.S. Department of
Agriculture 2016): Lonicera albiflora (western white honeysuckle), L. arizonica (Arizona
honeysuckle) and L. utahensis (Utah fly honeysuckle). Habitats for all three species are typically
at elevations above about 6,000 feet in shady forests or wooded slopes (Carter 1997; U.S.
Department of Agriculture 2016). Western white honeysuckle (Lonicera albiflora) is the most
likely species represented, as it is a common trailing-shrub or vine in western Texas described as
growing in cedar breaks, along cliff edges, rocky or sandy soils, and often on limestone (Texas
A&M 2016). Ethnographic accounts document use of honeysuckle bark, twigs, and leaves to
concoct strong medicines for a variety of skin conditions and sores in addition to use of the
flexible stems in basketry and the berries and flowers for food (Moerman 1998).
Among the common and abundant pollen types counted in project samples, two stand out in Pit
Structure 1 as enriched over background pollen rain (Table 10.4). Cheno-am and grass
percentages are two to three times higher in Pit Structure 1 samples than Feature 108, which is
compelling evidence for cultural use, although an alternative source for Cheno-am could be from
field weeds associated with growing maize. The grass signature is especially robust. Grasses
have a long history of use in the American Southwest (Doebley 1984) including consumption of
the grains for food, use of moist grass plants as a protective layer during roasting of larger
resources, and for packaging, insulation, thatch, and textiles. The grass pollen may have
originated from grass thatching and closing material used to construct the roof. A third enriched
pollen type is Tidestroemia, a ground-hugging annual that might represent another camp-follower
weed from maize fields.
Possible Agricultural Terraces: Two groups of pollen samples were submitted from the possible
agricultural features at LA 43414. The first group of samples was collected during the
geomorphological investigation of backhoe trenches across a selection of possible terraces (Table
10.5). The second group of samples was collected during hand excavations of Feature 108, a
suspected terrace feature (Table 10.6).
Four pollen samples were analyzed from possible rock terraces documented in Backhoe Trench 2
and 3 (Figure 10.2). An off-site control sample was also collected from modern dune sediments
to the north of the site. The pollen analysis was undertaken to search for evidence of cultigen
pollen. Modern vegetation in the site vicinity is grassland with yucca and mesquite.

Figure 10.2. View of possible agricultural feature and pollen sampling Location 1 in Backhoe Trench 3.

The results are presented as pollen percentage data in Table 10.5 along with summary measures
of pollen concentration and taxon richness. Twenty-two pollen types were identified, and these
are listed by common and scientific names. Pollen is scarce in the samples, as reflected by low
concentrations of less than 2600 gr/gm, and frequencies of degraded grains are high (range 10 to
27 percent). These two traits are characteristic of terrestrial samples taken from some depth
below ground surface (Hall 1991).
No cultigen pollen was recovered from the project samples, and assemblages are dominated by
sunflower family with moderate Cheno-am and grass. Sunflower family is a broad category that
subsumes a range of native desert shrubs (e.g. rabbitbrush [Chrysothamnus] and snakeweed
[Gutierrezia]) and herbaceous plants. There is no definitive contrast between the control sample
from BHT 4 and the other four samples, except for a higher frequency of grass pollen in the
control.
The interesting data are the pollen spectra recovered from the two BHT 3 samples. These
samples contain a mixed assemblage of what is interpreted as the local vegetation component
(sunflower family, Cheno-am, and grass with mustards and other herbs), and a non-local signal,
especially from Sample 1, characterized by conifers and rose family types with trace amounts of
spruce, fir, alder, and birch. In general, the project samples were described as collected from
darker soils containing higher organic fractions (see Table 10.2)
The second group of samples was collected during hand excavation of Feature 108. The nature of
the feature is inconclusive, as it could represent a rubble terrace or a portion of a house structure.
Five pollen samples collected from sediment described as cultural fill did not produce any
cultigen pollen and there is no other indication of agriculture or cultural activities, for example
irrigation or field weed signatures (see Table 10.6). Introduced exotic taxa are notable in one or
261

The Merchant Site

more of four samples, and include two wind-pollinated trees, elm and pecan, and the insectpollinated herb Erodium. There are native Erodium species, but the pollen type recovered from
shallow soils is generally attributed to the widespread Erodium cicutarium, a species that may
have been introduced with early Spanish explorers. There are no native elms in New Mexico, and
it is likely the occurrence of elm pollen in two samples reflects wind-dispersal from the popular
shade tree, Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), or the closely related Chinese elm (Ulmus parviflora).
Wind transport is also a reasonable explanation for pecan pollen in three samples with sources in
regional to local orchards and gardens.
Although the samples from Feature 108 did not reveal evidence of agriculture, the recovered
spectra provide an excellent view of on-site resources and the natural pollen imprint that can be
used to test the samples from Pit Structure 1 for cultural signatures (Table 10.7). Visible
economic resources in Feature 108 include prickly pear, mesquite, and spectacle pod
(Dimorphocarpa), a mustard that produces a spicy edible seed. Gish (1993:474) interpreted
spectacle pod pollen from archaeological sites in southern Arizona as representing cultural use.
Spectacle pod is one of the many inconspicuous native herbs that were likely abundant before
historic livestock over-grazing. Other mustard family pollen is also present in Feature 108 at
moderate percentages, and it is probable people harvested local species for early spring greens
and seeds.

Mesquite pollen in Feature 108 reflects a modern presence and the Pit Structure 1 macrobotanical
assemblages reviewed earlier in this chapter indicates a food source used by prehistoric residents.
Mesquite is one of the most dependable of desert foods because deep root systems tap
groundwater thereby buffering trees from droughts, although late frosts or high winds can destroy
a season’s seed crop (Hodgson 2001). The prized food is not the seeds, but the pods, which are
filled with a soft mesocarp tissue composed of sweet carbohydrates that surrounds and insulates
the seeds. Mesquite pods are gathered, usually after dropping to the ground, dried in various
ways, and then pounded in a mortar (Hodgson 2001), which frees the hard seeds and shreds the
mesocarp into a fine meal or flour separated by winnowing or screening. The stone-hard seeds
were also processed to meal but usually in crushers using gyratory grinders (see Felger and Moser
1985:340). Other valuable mesquite products include medicines made from saps, the pounded
roots, and inner bark, all manner of wooden tools and gadgets, and a black hair dye (Hodgson
2001; Moerman 1998).
Conclusions
The results from the analysis of pollen samples from two investigations do not support an
agricultural origin for the sampled areas. It is possible the sample depths were too deep to sense
potential agricultural levels. Pollen studies of ancient (ca. A.D. 1000 and 1400) field systems on
262

Chapter Ten
Plant and Pollen Remains from the Merchant Site

the northern Colorado Plateau have documented that cultigen pollen typically occurs within the
first 10 cm below ground surface (Smith 2008). The interesting results are the pollen spectra
recovered from the BHT 3 samples that suggest at this location deposits carry mixed signatures.
The age of the sampled levels at BHT 3 is unknown, but the presence of birch and alder and
significant percentages of conifer pollen indicate a past environment distinct from the modern
desert grassland or in some unknown way a pulse of higher elevation sediment accumulated. It is
possible that a Late Pleistocene to early Holocene grassland is represented within Backhoe
Trench 3 that was closer to forested communities than modern.
Pollen results from eight samples from two features excavated at the Merchant site confirm maize
was grown near the site, but probably not at Feature 108, a suspected farming terrace. There is no
pollen evidence from Feature 108 of cultigens or field weeds. However, the pollen samples
document presence of native mesquite, mustard family, prickly pear, and spectacle pod
(Dimorphocarpa) that were probably harvested from around the site for various food and other
practical products.
Maize pollen is concentrated in interior contexts from the deep Pit Structure 1 and occurs at
significant percentages in all three samples. Other interpreted subsistence plants interpreted from
Pit Structure 1 are lily family, which probably represents local yucca, Cheno-am, grasses, cattail,
possibly Tidestroemia, and a special record of honeysuckle (Lonicera). The presence of cattail
pollen indicates an accessible water source, but honeysuckle was probably not growing nearby.
The honeysuckle pollen suggests an imported trade item or plants gathered during trips to other
ecosystems. Taken together, it is also possible that the presence of maize, cattail, and
honeysuckle pollen relates to a ritual use of the structure.

Residue Analysis
As stipulated in the scope of work issued by the CFO, the excavation and study of two isolated
burned rock features in the southern part of LA 43414 (Feature 52 and 64) would include residue
analysis. The two features did not yield a wide range of soil or organic samples or artifact types
suitable for FTIR or protein residue analysis. Consultations with PaleoResearch, Inc. concluded
that the most suitable approach would be the analysis of starch grains and phytoliths embedded in
the edges and fractures of stone tools. A unifacial tool from burned rock midden Feature 52 and
an agave knife recovered from the small hearth Feature 64 were submitted for analysis.
The soil and organic samples from the two possible agricultural fields were also unsuitable for
FTIR or protein residue analysis. A metate fragment from Feature 95 and a core tool (chopper)
from Feature 108 were submitted for starch grain and phytolith analysis. The results of the
analysis are presented in Appendix C. No starch grain residues were present on the tools.
Phytoliths identified on the tools include several grass species and a dicot tentatively identified as
creosote. No phytoliths from known economic or subsistence plants were found on the tools.

Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site
Jeremy Loven and John D. Speth

Approximately 23,000 faunal specimens were recovered during the 2015 excavations of the
Merchant site. A sample representing 26 percent (n = 6,005) of the recovered animal remains has
been analyzed and is discussed in detail in this chapter. Of these, 4,088 (68 percent) were
identifiable to, at minimum, the level of size and class (Table 11.1). The remaining 1,917
specimens were categorized as unidentified vertebrate. The vast majority (n=4,070 [99.6
percent]) of the animal remains are mammalian in origin. The remaining specimens (18 [0.4
percent]) are all from either birds or reptiles. No fish or amphibians were identified within the
analyzed Merchant faunal assemblage.
The faunal remains from Merchant were primarily recovered from disturbed contexts, such as
backdirt piles created by the LCAS during their 1950s and 1960s excavations. It appears from
the nature of the material analyzed here, and this is corroborated by conversations with Bus Leslie
in the 1980s, that practically all of the animal remains, except for the bone artifacts, that were
encountered by the amateurs during the LCAS excavations were not collected and were left
behind on the site in backdirt piles, in sediment fill that has eroded back into the features, and
along the surface of the site and associated escarpment. The selective collection biases are most
clearly demonstrated by comparing the proportions of projectile points and bone specimens
tabulated for the LCAS excavations (1,527 projectile points and less than 100 bone items) against
the 2015 investigations (less than 100 projectile points and over 23,000 bone specimens).
Unfortunately, the excavations by the LCAS, as well as decades of looting activity, destroyed
much of the artifactual context at Merchant and have made it difficult to determine exactly which
bones or artifacts are associated with which features. However, we can assume with some
confidence that the material from the backdirt piles around, and within, Pit Structure 1 were
associated with the original stratified refuse deposits in the structure. The same is likely true for
Pit Structure 2 as well. Considering the location of Refuse Area A, it is also reasonable to infer
that the material comprising this refuse area was associated with the domestic room blocks,
although it is impossible to determine exact room provenience. We also know from notes taken
by Leslie during the LCAS excavation that the bones strewn along the surface of the escarpment
originated from Pit Structure 1. Despite some of the analytical limitations caused by past
activities at the site, much can still be learned about the utilization of faunal resources by the
inhabitants of Merchant.

One feature of the faunal assemblage that becomes strikingly clear is that the prehistoric
inhabitants of the site relied predominantly on large mammals for protein, fat, and hides. Large
mammals identified within the Merchant faunal assemblage include bison, pronghorn, and deer.
Remains from large artiodactyls (bison) and from medium artiodactyls (deer/pronghorn) are
present in similar quantities; however, given the substantially larger size of bison, they would
have been the most important source of meat and fat for the villagers. While artiodactyls were a
crucial food resource for the people of Merchant, the meat, fat, and hides of bison, deer, and
pronghorn were also likely important trade goods used in exchange systems with western Pueblo
villages located in the Sierra Blanca region of the Sacramento Mountains.

266

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Analytical Methods and Assemblage Characteristics
Identification
Identifications of the 6,005 analyzed faunal specimens that were recovered from the Merchant
site were made by using the analyst’s (Jeremy Loven) personal comparative collection, the
comparative collection located in the Department of Anthropology and Applied Archaeology at
Eastern New Mexico University (Portales), and when necessary, by referencing Gilbert (1990).
The initial step in the analysis of the faunal specimens involved identifying the particular skeletal
element from which the specimens originated. Specimens (complete bones or bone fragments, or
complete teeth or tooth fragments) in which the element could be identified were subsequently
assigned to a particular taxonomic group. These groupings include the animal’s order, family,
genus, or species. For specimens where the element could not be identified, an attempt was made
to identify the size and class of animal that the specimen originated from, such as large mammal,
small mammal, large bird, or small bird. All specimens in which neither the taxa nor a size and
class determination could be made were categorized as unidentified vertebrate. For each
identifiable specimen an attempt was made to classify it to the lowest taxonomic level possible.
During the analysis, each specimen was analyzed and identified on its own merit, and taxonomic
identifications were determined by using diagnostic features present on the bones. Grouping and
identifying by association was generally avoided. The grouping of bones together based solely
on context and association can be quite problematic (Driver 2011), and is typically based on a
level of assumption.
In addition to identifying the element and taxon, or the size and class, of each identifiable
specimen, numerous other attributes and modifications were recorded when possible. These
included provenience, condition, portion, side, fusion, burning, artifact type, gnawing, natural
modification, butchering marks, and total specimen counts. For the purpose of identifying more
discreet traits potentially present on the bones, such as gnaw marks and cut marks, a hand lens
and/or magnifying lamp were used when necessary.
Quantification
For this analysis, the primary method of calculation is the number of identified specimens (NISP),
and it is used to quantify the abundance and frequency of the taxa comprising the faunal
assemblage (Grayson 1984:17). Despite some flaws and problems with the NISP, it is the most
widely utilized quantification method for calculating taxonomic abundance in current faunal
analyses. Grayson (1984) clearly outlined the problems with the NISP, but the most significant
issues with this method concern bone fragmentation and interdependence. Excessive bone
fragmentation can potentially inflate NISP values, sometimes greatly. This can particularly
impact large mammal specimens, whose “bones tend to be broken into more pieces than those of
smaller mammals, and thus over-exaggerate the importance of larger mammals” (Driver
1985:11). To partially alleviate the problem of bone fragmentation on NISP values, bone
fragments were refit when possible.
In addition to the total bone counts, the NISP was used to calculate the Artiodactyl Index and the
Lagomorph Index for the Merchant faunal assemblage. These two indices are commonly used to
interpret faunal assemblages recovered from archaeological sites located in the U.S. Southwest.
Both are important for providing insight into the relative abundance of artiodactyls and
lagomorphs within the environment and the frequencies in which these animals were utilized by
past populations.
The Artiodactyl Index (AI), as developed by Bayham (1982), compares the relative abundance of
artiodactyls and lagomorphs (Szuter and Bayham 1989:83), and is essentially an index used to
determine the ratio of large mammals (usually antelope and deer) to the two most abundant small
267

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

mammals most often recovered from archaeological sites (cottontails and jackrabbits). For the
purposes of this study, the Artiodactyl Index has been modified to incorporate animals
categorized as "large mammal" and "very large mammal" into the artiodactyl category. During
the late Prehistoric period in this region of the Southwest, it is extremely unlikely that any
animals identified as "large mammal" or "very large mammal" would belong to any order of
animals other than Artiodactyla. Thus, the modification of the original AI formula in this
instance is appropriate. The AI ranges from 0 (all lagomorphs, no artiodactyls) to 1 (all
artiodactyls, no lagomorphs). To calculate the AI the following formula is used:
Artiodactyl Index (AI) = artiodactyls + large mammals / (artiodactyls + large mammals) + lagomorphs

The Lagomorph Index is a ratio of cottontails to total lagomorphs (cottontails plus jackrabbits),
and is useful for calculating the relative abundance of cottontails and jackrabbits within a faunal
assemblage (Driver and Woiderski 2007:7). It is scored on a scale of 0 to 1. A score of 1 is
indicative of all cottontails, while a score of 0 is indicative of all jackrabbits. The formula used
for calculating the Lagomorph Index is:
Lagomorph Index (LI) = cottontails / (cottontails + jackrabbits)

The Lagomorph Index can provide insight not only into the subsistence patterns of a local
population in regards to the consumption of the two rabbit types, but can also be used to illustrate
certain ecological realities within a particular location. Cottontails and jackrabbits thrive in
different ecological conditions. Cottontails avoid predation by hiding or occupying burrows
(Bailey 1931:54, 55) and prefer habitats thick with brush and grasses, while jackrabbits typically
avoid predation by outrunning their predators (Driver and Woiderski 2007:5) and survive and
reproduce most successfully on more open landscapes. Generally, cottontails are more successful
than jackrabbits in lusher environments, such as riverine/floodplain environments (Dean
2007:15).
The Lagomorph Index can function to provide a better understanding of the local
paleoenvironment that surrounded an archaeological site and the relative abundance of cottontails
and jackrabbits within that environment, but factors other than local ecology must also be
considered when interpreting the results. Although LI values can represent a direct correlation
between lagomorph abundance and natural environment, they are often influenced by cultural
factors as well. Human behaviors and actions, such as communal hunting, alteration of the
natural environment and vegetation through agriculture and irrigation, increases in human
population density and long-term habitations, and prey choice can all potentially affect LI values
(Dean 2007; Driver and Woiderski 2007). Thus, when interpreting the results of the Lagomorph
Index, it is imperative to consider all potential factors, both natural and cultural, that could be
influencing the results.

The faunal remains collected from the Merchant site were recovered from a variety of contexts,
including the backdirt pile around Pit Structure 1 and the redeposited fill within Pit Structure 1,
Refuse Area A, Refuse Area B, the fill from Pit Structure 2, the Escarpment, and an extramural
hearth. A complete analysis was conducted on the faunal remains recovered from all contexts
except for those associated with Pit Structure 1. Due to the vast quantity of animal bones
recovered from the backdirt pile and the redeposited fill within Pit Structure 1, only a sample of
these remains was analyzed; however, at minimum a sample from each excavation unit
containing identifiable faunal remains was analyzed.
All of the sediment and fill removed during the 2015 excavation site was screened. The majority
of the faunal remains recovered during the 2015 excavation, including the sample analyzed for
this report, were collected directly while excavating or through screening the sediment fill
268

Chapter Eleven

through wire mesh. The majority of the backdirt was passed through ¼-inch mesh, with
approximately 10 percent of the fill from the various levels and units being passed through ⅛inch mesh.
Fill from archaeological sites in much of the U.S. is most commonly screened through ¼-inch
mesh. Although this is significantly more efficient than screening though smaller mesh sizes and
is completely satisfactory for recovering faunal specimens originating from larger animals, it does
function to bias faunal assemblages. Specimens from smaller animals, particularly those
weighing less than 340 grams, or smaller than a gray squirrel size, will almost certainly be
underrepresented (Shaffer 1992:131). This is primarily due to the small size of small animal
bones, causing some bones and bone fragments from these animals to fall through the screen
unnoticed. Controlled experiments by Shaffer and Sanchez (1994) produced results indicating
that only “taxa larger than 4,500 grams (fox sized) will have the potential for nearly total
recovery” (Shaffer and Sanchez 1994:525). Their (Shaffer and Sanchez 1994) experiments were
performed using complete bones predominantly from adult specimens. The recovery of bones
from small animals becomes even more problematic and limited with increasing bone
fragmentation.
Although the potential for sample bias against small animal specimens exists, the impact is surely
minimal. The use of ⅛-inch mesh to screen at least a tenth of the fill during the excavation of
Merchant, as well as the skill and experience of the excavators in identifying faunal remains,
assisted in limiting potential bias.
Fragmentation
The animal remains comprising the Merchant faunal assemblage have a high degree of
fragmentation caused by both pre-depositional and post-depositional processes, and the
substantial fragmentation of the faunal remains has made identification of the skeletal elements
quite difficult and in many instances impossible. Much of the pre-depositional fragmentation of
bone, particularly in regards to large mammals, is probably the result of marrow and grease
extraction activities. Bones from large mammals are commonly fractured in various ways to
obtain marrow (Binford 1981:148-162), and sometimes broken into smaller fragments to increase
the rate of grease extraction from the bones (Church and Lyman 2003:1083). Post-depositional
processes that affect bone fragmentation include natural taphonomic processes, such as
weathering and erosion, and trampling and recovery damage caused during excavation and
looting activities that have occurred at the Merchant site.
Overall, 90 percent of the faunal specimens are less than one-quarter complete, and degree of
completeness is much less with larger mammals than smaller mammals. Approximately 27
percent of all lagomorph specimens are less than one-quarter complete, whereas over 90 percent
of all artiodactyl specimens are less than one-quarter complete. This disparity is due to
differences in pre-depositional processing of the bones and in recovery bias during excavation.
While the marrow- and grease-rich bones of the pronghorn, deer, and bison appear to have been
subjected to purposeful breakage to extract these resources, it is doubtful that many, or any, of the
lagomorph bones were purposefully subjected to this level of processing. The prehistoric
inhabitants of Merchant were probably rich enough in large mammal protein and fat from the
muscle, organs, and bones of these animals, that there was no need or incentive to invest
substantial time and energy in hyperprocessing rabbit bones. Recovery bias may also have
influenced the percentage of lagomorph remains less than one-quarter complete, as remains of
this size are likely to fall through the wire mesh during screening. In contrast, artiodactyl remains
are large enough, even when less than one-quarter complete, to be captured by ¼-inch wire mesh
and hence to be collected during the screening process.

Taxonomic Composition
Taxonomic groups represented within the Merchant faunal assemblage include artiodactyls,
lagomorphs, carnivores, rodents, birds and reptiles. Mammals were the most important fauna for
the people of Merchant, and account for over 99 percent of all identified faunal remains. No fish
or amphibian remains were identified, and their absence indicates that they were likely seldom, if
ever, used as a food source by the prehistoric inhabitants of Merchant.
Artiodactyls
Artiodactyls are the most abundant taxa identified within in the Merchant faunal assemblage and
account for over 13 percent (NISP = 542) of all identified remains. Additionally, 70 percent of
all specimens are classified as large mammal (deer size) or very large mammal (bison size), and
all of these bones most likely originate from artiodactyls. The only other mammals in the area
large enough in size to possibly be mistaken for artiodactyls are bears, mountain lions, and
humans. Black bears (Ursus americanus) and mountain lions (Felis concolor) inhabit the
Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains today (Findley et al. 1975:293, 318) and certainly did so
prehistorically as well. As such, the inhabitants of Merchant probably could have had access to
these animals, either through hunting or trade. However, none of the Merchant faunal remains
were positively identified as bear or mountain lion, and it is doubtful that many, if any, of the
faunal specimens identified as “large mammal” originate from either of these taxa. Human
remains of course are possible as well, but even in fragmentary condition, human bones are often
readily distinguishable from those of other mammals. Thus, it is generally safe to consider that
all of the specimens classified as “large mammal” and “very large mammal” are bison, deer, or
pronghorn in nature.
Represented among the 542 bones positively identified as artiodactyls are specimens originating
from mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), indeterminate deer (Odocoileus sp.), pronghorn
(Antilocapra americana), and bison (Bison bison) (Figure 11.1 and Figure 11.2). All of these
taxa were significant food resources for the inhabitants of Merchant and probably were also
important as sources of hides. The medium-sized artiodactyls (deer and pronghorn) and the large
artiodactyl (bison) are present in similar numbers in terms of NISP values; however, given the
much larger size of bison, it certainly contributed more meat to the diet than deer and pronghorn
and was probably considered a more valued resource. Bison have a body mass ranging from
about 318 to 545 kg for females and about 544 to 907 kg from males (Meagher 1986:1), whereas
the maximum weight for a pronghorn is approximately 60 kg.
Both mule deer and white-tailed deer inhabit southeastern New Mexico today (Findley et al.
1975:328-332), and specimens from both species are probably present within the Merchant faunal
assemblage. Differentiating mule deer bones from those of white-tailed deer is extremely
difficult, especially when fragmentary. One specimen was positively identified as being from a
mule deer, but the remaining 31 deer specimens could only be identified to the level of genus
(Odocoileus).
Pronghorn specimens (NISP = 48) are more abundant than deer in the Merchant assemblage.
Pronghorn are well adapted to the plains region of southeastern New Mexico and as late as 1899
ranged over most of the open plains and valley country (Bailey 1931:22); they are still plentiful
today on the eastern plains of New Mexico. They undoubtedly were plentiful on the plains
during the late prehistoric period as well, as they have been documented in plentiful numbers at
numerous archaeological sites, including Merchant, Henderson (Speth 2004b), Rocky Arroyo
(Wiseman 2013), and Bloom Mound (Driver 1985; Kelley 1984). These herd animals exist by
grazing on grasses and forbs and thrive on open grassland plains and valleys where they can use
their speed to escape predation (Bailey 1931:26). Pronghorn are also well-adapted to xeric
conditions and require less water than deer (Driver 1985:15).
270

Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Although some of the medium ungulate specimens could be identified to the genus and species
level, the majority of all medium ungulate remains could only by identified to the more basic
levels of Odocoileus/Antilocapra (NISP = 179) or medium artiodactyl (NISP = 32). The
Odocoileus/Antilocapra designation is used for specimens in which the skeletal element could be
identified, but differentiating between the two genera was uncertain or impossible. The medium
artiodactyl category consists primarily of heavily fragmented rib and enamel fragments that could
not be positively assigned as Odocoileus/Antilocapra. It is extremely likely that the medium

Figure 11.2. Various bison bones recovered during the 2015 excavations of the Merchant site.

artiodactyl specimens are from these two taxa, but the possibility exists they could be from
bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) or even javelina (Dicotyles tajacu). Bighorn sheep are known to
have inhabited the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains historically (Findley et al. 1975:335336), and they also most likely roamed these areas during the time period corresponding with the
occupation of Merchant. The javelina was common in the sand dunes of extreme southeastern
New Mexico into the very early twentieth century (Bailey 1931:10-11) and was probably
common during the late prehistoric period as well. However, none of the animal remains were
positively identified as javelina or bighorn sheep, so it is probably safe to assume that all of the
medium artiodactyl specimens are deer or pronghorn.
Bison remains (NISP = 59) are present in slightly greater numbers than pronghorn and deer. Of
all taxa identified within the Merchant assemblage, only the black-tailed jackrabbit produced a
higher NISP value (153). In addition to the 59 specimens positively identified as bison, another
192 bones were classified as “very large artiodactyl,” all of which are almost certainly bison.
Additionally, bison were extremely plentiful on the eastern plains of New Mexico during the time
Merchant was inhabited and were still abundant when the Spanish explorer Antonio de Espejo
traveled through the Pecos River valley and described passing through great herds of buffalo
(Bailey 1931:12). However, by 1859 few wild bison remained in New Mexico, and the last four
were reported killed in 1884 in the far southeastern corner of New Mexico (Bailey 1931:14). The
only other extant animal in the late prehistoric American Southwest large enough to be placed
272

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

into the “very large artiodactyl” category was the elk. Although elk apparently did inhabit the
Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains during this time period, none of the faunal remains from
Merchant could be positively identified as elk. Additionally, elk almost never appear in late
prehistoric archaeological contexts in the region.
Lagomorphs
After artiodactyls, the most common taxa identified were lagomorphs (NISP = 170), which
account for just over 4 percent of all identified remains. An additional 2.8 percent (n = 116) of all
specimens were categorized as "small mammal" and originated from animals ranging in size from
that of a prairie dog to jackrabbit; however, the majority of these specimens are likely of
lagomorph origin. Together, lagomorph and lagomorph-size remains total almost 7 percent of the
assemblage.
Lagomorph specimens from the genera Lepus (jackrabbits) and Sylvilagus (cottontails) are both
represented within the Merchant faunal assemblage. The vast majority of the lagomorph remains
(NISP = 153) are from the genus Lepus, with all of these probably being from the species Lepus
californicus (black-tailed jackrabbit). Sixteen of the lagomorph specimens are identified as
Sylvilagus audubonii (desert cottontail). The black-tailed jackrabbit and the desert cottontail are
the only species of rabbits that currently inhabit far southeastern New Mexico (Findley et al.
1975:83-97) and were almost certainly the only species to have inhabited the area during the late
prehistoric period as well. In addition to the lagomorph specimens identified to species, one
lagomorph specimen could only be identified to the level of order and is classified as
indeterminate lagomorph.
The Lagomorph Index (LI) value of 0.09 is extremely low. This is probably due to both natural
and cultural processes. The environment around Merchant currently provides, and surely did 700
years ago, suitable habitats for both cottontails and jackrabbits. However, the somewhat sparsely
vegetated environs and open landscape directly surrounding Merchant probably provided a
habitat slightly more preferential for jackrabbits. This naturally preferential habitat could have
increased and expanded during the occupation of Merchant, if the occupation was large enough
and continuous enough to allow for significant anthropogenic alterations to the local
environment, particularly changes that would influence lagomorph populations. Permanent and
intense occupations of a site result in the clearing of land and destroying of ground cover,
encouraging a decrease in the ratio of cottontails to jackrabbits (Szuter and Bayham 1989:93).
Excessive fuel consumption can contribute to this as well.
The low LI value is possibly also influenced by other cultural activities such as communal
hunting. Rabbit drives were typically employed by communal parties sweeping through a
previously defined area and beating the bushes and grasses and forcing the jackrabbits, along with
some cottontails, into nets or restricted killing fields or by killing the rabbits as they were flushed
(Beaglehole 1936:12; Szuter and Bayham 1989:92). Although some cottontails were taken
during communal hunts, jackrabbits were the principal targets (Russell 1908:82).
The practice of communal hunting for rabbits, which likely occurred at Merchant and helps to
explain the low LI value, could have been performed for purposes other than to secure meat and
skins. Among the Hopi, for example, it was customary for young boys to be initiated into the
rabbit hunting field before being given the opportunity to hunt for large game, and hunting
initiation wasn't achieved until a boy killed his first jackrabbit (Beaglehole 1936:14-15).
Communal rabbit drives practiced by groups such as the Hopi and Havasupai generally
comprised only male participants (Beaglehole 1936:13; Whiting 1985:34); however, the Hopi had
a tradition of occasionally having rabbit hunts where unmarried girls joined the hunters for the
purpose of encouraging courtship activity (Beaglehole 1936:13). Although, communal hunting
certainly was performed with the intent of capturing jackrabbits for their meat and skins, it is very
273

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

possible that communal hunts were equally conducted with the objective of initiating and training
young boys into the methodological and cultural practices of hunting, and possibly to provide an
avenue for social activities similar to those practiced by the Hopi.
Carnivores
Carnivore specimens are extremely rare and are represented by only 13 total bones. All but one
of the bones has been identified as being from the genus Canis, and all of these certainly originate
from either dogs or coyotes. The other specimen is from a red fox (Vulpes vulpes). One of the
dog/coyote bones is charred and one is calcined, suggesting possible use as a food source by the
inhabitants of Merchant. Although dogs are known to have been eaten by prehistoric populations
throughout the Southwest, the small quantity of canid remains identified within the Merchant
faunal assemblage suggests they were rarely eaten at Merchant.
Rodents
Remains from rodents are also very rare (NISP = 6). However, despite the low NISP value, this
order of animal displays surprising richness. Three different genera of rodents are identified
within the faunal assemblage: Dipodomys (kangaroo rat), Geomys (pocket gopher), and Neotoma
(woodrat). The genera Dipodomys and Geomys are represented by only one specimen each. The
remaining four specimens are all from woodrats, with three of those specimens identified as being
from the species Neotoma albigula (White-throated woodrat). None of the rodent specimens
display evidence of processing and are probably noncultural intrusions to the site.
Birds
Only four avian specimens were identified within the faunal assemblage. This includes three
bones identified as turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and one bone that could only be identified as
being from a small bird. None of these avian remains show signs of cultural modification.
Reptiles
Twelve reptile specimens were identified, and all of these are turtle carapace fragments. One of
the carapace fragments was exposed to fire and is calcined. Five of the specimens could only be
identified to the genus level (Testudinata), while the other seven specimens are identified as
being from the ornate box turtle, also known as the western box turtle (Terrapene ornata). Dense
populations of ornate box turtles are common in the sandy desert areas of southeast New Mexico
(Degenhardt and Christiansen 1974:32) where the soils are suitable for burrowing (Degenhardt et
al. 1996:105).
Although turtles were possibly used as a food source at Merchant, it is more likely that they were
primarily of non-dietary importance, especially considering no other skeletal elements from
turtles were identified within the faunal assemblage. The turtle carapaces could be pieces from
cups or dippers or could have been used as dance rattles. Ethnographically, turtles are known to
have been collected by prehistoric peoples in the Southwest for the purpose of using the turtle
shells as dance rattles (Beaglehole 1936:22; Parsons 1939:384-385), and this could have been the
original function of the turtle shell fragments recovered from Merchant.

Modified Bone
Burned and Butchered Bone
The frequency of burned bone is low within the Merchant faunal assemblage and few of the
bones have obvious cut marks (Table 11.2). Only 6.5 percent (n = 266) of the identified animal
remains have discoloration due to burning. The majority (n = 200) of the burned specimens

were charred black. Sixty-three of the bones were calcined, which is caused by exposure to
intense heat. Two additional specimens were calcined and charred, and a single bone was brown
as a result of exposure to heat.
Cut marks from butchering are extremely rare and are present on only eight of the faunal
specimens. Three of the specimens displaying cut marks are large mammal shaft fragments, one
bone is a scapula fragment from a mule deer, another bone is a scapula fragment from a deer or
pronghorn, one is a femur fragment from a bison, one specimen is a metapodial fragment from a
medium-sized artiodactyl, and the remaining bone possessing cut marks is a tibia from a
jackrabbit. As for the large mammals, it is very likely that a much higher percentage of bones
displayed cut marks at the time of initial discard, but these marks have since been obliterated by
taphonomic processes as a result of exposure, increased fragmentation, and trampling caused by
excavations and looting activities that occurred during the mid-twentieth century.
Bones from small mammals and other non-mammalian classes of animals recovered from
Southwest archaeological sites infrequently possess cut marks, as the skeletons of these animals
can easily be disarticulated by hand and without the use of tools. Additionally, the preparation of
small animals often requires little to no dismemberment prior to cooking. Prehistorically,
indigenous populations of the American Southwest commonly cooked animals such as rabbits
and prairie dogs by stewing or roasting them whole (Beaglehole 1936:14; Speth 2000:102).
Bone Artifacts
Only three worked bone specimens were identified in the faunal assemblage collected during the
current investigation. These include two awl fragments fashioned from large mammal bones.
Both of these fragments are the tip portion of the awls. A worked jackrabbit tibia also was
identified; however, the exact function of the artifact could not be determined.
A total of 104 bone artifacts were recorded during the LCAS excavations during the early 1960s.
Examples of these artifacts are illustrated in Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4. Identified artifact types
included awls (n = 47), notched bone (n = 47), carved/incised bone (n = 7), and antler billets (n =
3); additionally, three pieces of utilized antler were reported by Leslie. Unfortunately, the LCAS
collection of bone artifacts is lost and could not be reanalyzed for this report. The collection
practices of the LCAS, as well as the removal of artifacts from the Merchant site by looters, have
resulted in the apparent scarcity of worked bone items recovered during the current work at
Merchant.

Intrasite Assemblage Variability
Faunal remains were recovered from several contexts and features during the 2015 investigations.
Most of the contexts were backdirt deposits that had been screened by the LCAS crews. The
majority of the faunal remains were recovered from Pit Structure 1, primarily because the fill
from Pit Structure 1 contained a significantly larger quantity of bone, but also because
substantially more of the fill from this feature was screened and examined than from any other
feature. However, a significant amount of bone also was collected from Pit Structure 2, Refuse
Area A, and Refuse Area B, and this allows for some interesting comparisons and insights. The
faunal assemblages recovered from all of these contexts contained bison, deer/pronghorn,
jackrabbit, and cottontail. All but one of the dog/coyote specimens were from Pit Structure 1.
All of the bird remains were found in Pit Structure 1, while the turtle remains were recovered
from Pit Structure 1 and the refuse areas.

Figure 11.4. Bone tools recovered during the LCAS excavations of the Merchant site. The scale at the right
applies only to the rasps.

The Artiodactyl Index (AI) calculated for each of the different features is very similar to the
overall site-wide AI of 0.95. The faunal assemblage recovered from Pit Structure 1 produced an
identical AI of 0.95, the AI for Pit Structure 2 is 0.90, the AI for Refuse Area A is 0.93, and the
AI for Refuse Area B is 0.92. This is important because it implies that the high AI value
calculated for the total assemblage is not being biased and artificially inflated by the dense layer
of bone that Leslie documented in Pit Structure 1. The similarly large frequencies of artiodactyl
remains recovered from the various contexts suggests that the inhabitants of Merchant were

277

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

actually relying primarily on artiodactyl resources, specifically bison, pronghorn, and deer, for the
vast bulk of their animal protein and fat needs.

Regional Context and Comparison
The Merchant faunal assemblage is very similar to those that have been documented at other late
prehistoric architectural sites located on the plains of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent
areas of west Texas (Figure 11.5). In general, these assemblages are dominated by artiodactyls
and lagomorphs, with other taxonomic orders either present in much smaller quantities or
altogether absent. Fish appear to have been a highly utilized food resource at the Roswell sites
(Akins 2002:146; Speth et al. 2004:306; Wiseman 2013:52) and were seemingly available in
large numbers in the western tributary rivers that flowed into the Pecos River (Speth et al.
2004:305). In contrast, fish are entirely absent from the Merchant site and from the Andrew Lake
Locality Salt Cedar site (Collins 1968:116-119), an Ochoa settlement located in Andrews County,
Texas, in close proximity to Merchant. The lack of fish remains at these sites is no doubt due to
their being located long distances from permanent fish-bearing rivers or lakes. Birds, especially
waterfowl such as American coot (Fulica americana), but also various owls, raptors, and
passerines, are fairly numerous in the Roswell sites, while turkeys, though present, are
conspicuous by their scarcity. Reptiles, represented mostly by turtle carapace fragments, are
present as well, especially in the form of small disc-shaped and lozenge-shaped “gaming pieces.”

278

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Of primary interest for the current faunal study is the utilization of lagomorph and artiodactyl
resources. At Merchant and Rocky Arroyo, jackrabbits are the dominant lagomorph, but at
Bloom Mound and Henderson, cottontails produced much higher NISP values (Table 11.3; Figure
11.6). The high ratio of cottontails to jackrabbits at Henderson (LI = 0.7) and Bloom Mound
(LI = 0.72) is likely a reflection of their relative abundance in the environment during the
occupation of these sites. During the late prehistoric period and prior to A.D. 1900, the Roswell
region was well watered and the areas along the rivers might have provided habitats more
favorable for cottontails. Cottontails generally prefer areas around water and with thicker
vegetation (Szuter and Bayham 1989:92). The Rocky Arroyo assemblage contained slightly
more jackrabbits than cottontails. It is interesting that the LI for Rocky Arroyo (LI = 0.43) differs
from the LI values from Henderson and Bloom Mound, considering it is located in close
proximity to the other Roswell sites and occupies a similar environment. The Rocky Arroyo LI
value could be an accurate reflection of natural conditions surrounding the site that for some
reason favored greater numbers of jackrabbits than at the other Roswell sites, or it might instead
denote differences in cultural practices, such as the more frequent use of communal drives, that
biased the assemblage against cottontails. On the other hand, the ratio may reflect little more than
recovery bias. Rocky Arroyo was looted by local avocational archaeologists. While it appears
that the looters screened, recovering a lot of faunal remains in the process, they subsequently
discarded the bones, abandoning (apparently) everything in large buckets on the surface of the
site. It is quite likely that many of the diminutive rabbit bones recovered in their screens either
escaped the attention of the excavators or were deemed uninteresting and not collected from the
screens. The Merchant LI value (LI = 0.09) is extremely low, and does not seem to be suffering
to any great degree from sample bias. Considering that much of the fill screened during the
current project was passed through ⅛-inch mesh, it is unlikely that screening practices introduced
significant bias. The low LI value for Merchant is probably being influenced by both the natural
ecology of the area and hunting strategies, as well as other cultural practices.

Additionally, 75 percent of the cottontail bones analyzed were greater than 25 percent complete,
so it does not appear that excessive fragmentation of cottontail bones has greatly influenced the
quantity of cottontail specimens recovered, except for the tiny bones of the forelimb. As sample
bias is probably not influencing the lagomorph ratios, at least to any appreciable degree, the
accuracy of the low LI value can be accepted with reasonable confidence. Thus, the wide
difference in the LI values between Merchant and the Roswell sites is likely caused by
differences in local ecology and possibly in hunting practices as well. Another factor
contributing to the low LI value at Merchant could be geological. The Merchant site rests on a
surface with shallow sediments covering caliche bedrock. The shallow sediments at the site and
areas surrounding the site probably limit or prevent burrowing by cottontails and other small
mammals. As such, the inability of cottontails to hide in burrows to avoid predators could have
limited their abundance in the environment near Merchant.
The artiodactyl index values for Merchant (AI = 0.95), Rocky Arroyo (AI = 0.96), and Henderson
(AI = 0.51) (see Table 11.3) display the importance of large mammal resources to the inhabitants
of these villages, especially at Merchant and Rocky Arroyo. At these three sites, bison,
pronghorn, and deer were crucial and valuable dietary resources, and bison almost certainly
functioned as an important resource used for trade with Puebloan villages in the upland areas to
the west. Almost the inverse is true for Bloom Mound, where the AI value is a paltry 0.2. Bloom
Mound is believed to have been occupied slightly after Rocky Arroyo and Henderson, and
possibly after Merchant as well, and this is directly correlated with the low AI value. During the
Bloom Mound occupation, bison hunting, particularly long-distance bison hunting, virtually
collapsed (Speth and Staro 2012:19). This is apparently due to increasing competition with
280

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Plains groups and the concomitant dangers of violence and warfare. Thus, the low AI value
calculated for Bloom Mound is most likely a reflection of cultural factors and not natural changes
in the environment, climate, or natural abundance of bison on the plains.
When placed into context with sites from the greater Jornada region, including upland Jornada
sites located in the Sacramento Mountains and the lowland Jornada sites of the Tularosa Basin,
the AI and LI values for Merchant and Rocky Arroyo appear even more unique (Figure 11.7).
Both have high AI values similar to those calculated for most upland Jornada sites but have low
LI values that resemble many lowland Jornada sites. The similarities in AI values between
Merchant and the upland Jornada sites are likely a reflection of the greater natural abundance of
medium and large artiodactyls in the mountains and on the plains than in the desert basin
environments. The reasons for the comparable LI values for Merchant and Rocky Arroyo, and
many of the lowland Jornada sites, are more complicated to determine and explain, but the values
are all probably being influenced by a combination of natural and cultural factors.

settlements and lowland and upland settlements of the western Jornada.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

A calculation of various utility index values (Table 11.4), including the food utility index (FUI)
(Metcalfe and Jones 1998), the modified general utility index (MGUI) (Binford 1978), and the
unsaturated marrow index (UMI) (Morin 2007), for Merchant and the Roswell sites produced
higher utility values for large ungulates (bison-sized) than for medium ungulates
(deer/pronghorn-sized) for all sites, except for Bloom Mound. Essentially, these indices were
designed to “predict various butchering and transport decisions, and to provide archaeologists
with a set of expectations about how different hunting and subsistence strategies should be
reflected in the frequency of faunal elements in archaeological assemblages” (Metcalfe and Jones
1988:486). Higher utility values within a faunal assemblage implies that there was a focus on
selecting and transporting higher utility elements, or those containing larger amounts of meat,
marrow, and/or bone grease, such as upper limb bones and ribs. The choice to focus on the
higher utility elements for bison probably reflects a combination of greater body size and field
culling of lower utility elements (skull, phalanges, carpals/tarsals) prior to transport back to the
settlements. Another factor potentially influencing the higher utility values for bison is transport
distance. It is possible that bison were being encountered at a greater distance from the
settlements than were deer or pronghorn, resulting in a greater proportion of the bison carcasses
being left at the kill site than those from deer and pronghorn.

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

Bison Goods and Trade at the Merchant Site
Large mammal resources were of considerable importance to the inhabitants of Merchant and
were probably a determining factor or reason for why this site was originally occupied and
continued to be occupied for over 100 years. The large quantity of bison, deer, and pronghorn
remains recovered from the Merchant site, as well as the high ratio of artiodactyls to lagomorphs,
illustrates the importance of large mammal resources to this population. They also support the
assumption that these mammals were likely abundant in the regional environment during the
occupation of Merchant.
Although all of the ungulates served as valuable local resources and were utilized extensively by
the local population for meat, fat, hide, sinew, and bone tools, the bison also was likely a very
important trade resource. Trade networks with Puebloan groups to the west are apparent,
considering the presence of Puebloan ceramics and other nonlocal resources such as obsidian in
the Merchant artifact assemblage. In exchange, the Merchant people presumably traded
perishables, such as bison meat, fat, and hides.
Dried bison rib units and meat were probably traded into villages in the Sierra Blanca region of
the Sacramento Mountains (Driver 1985:61) and possibly to the Salinas region farther west.
Bison were unlikely to have inhabited those regions prehistorically, thus, long-distance transport
would have been required to bring bison remains into these villages (Driver 1985:60).
Excavation of sites in the Sierra Blanca and Salinas regions have produced faunal assemblages in
which the bison remains are dominated by ribs and vertebrae and have few postcranial elements
(Speth and Rautman 2004:128; Speth and Staro 2012:22). In contrast, bison ribs are very scarce
at Merchant and the Roswell sites (Henderson, Rocky Arroyo, Bloom Mound), relative to other
postcranial elements (Table 11.5). This difference in skeletal element representation between the
mountain uplands and lowland sites of the Pecos valley suggests the potential for trade in bison
goods from the Roswell sites (Speth and Rautman 2004:128-131; Speth and Staro 2012:22) and
the Merchant site (Driver, personal communication 2016) into the upland village sites.

Another factor that should be examined as an explanation for the paucity of ribs at Merchant is
carnivore activity, particularly from domesticated dogs. If carnivore activity was the culprit, then
the smaller and more fragile ribs from the medium ungulates (deer/pronghorn) should be present
in significantly lower percentages than the more robust ribs of the large ungulates (bison) (Speth
and Rautman 2004:128). Ribs account for 3.2 percent (NISP = 34) of all large ungulate
specimens, while ribs originating from medium ungulates comprise 2.3 percent (NISP = 56) of all
medium ungulate remains. Given the similar proportion of rib elements between the large and
medium ungulates, it is unlikely that dogs are responsible for the low percentages of rib elements
at Merchant. Also, if carnivore destruction of bone was significant at the site, then evidence of
carnivore gnawing on bones should be abundant. Only one bone, a large artiodactyl humerus,

283

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

displays evidence of carnivore gnawing. It is therefore doubtful that dogs contributed
significantly to the destruction or modification of faunal remains at the Merchant site.

Ritual Use of Fauna at the Merchant Site
The utilization of animals and animal remains for ritual purposes was a common practice by
many cultures and societies throughout the late prehistoric Southwest. Numerous taxa of animal
were used in rituals and ceremonies or found in ritual contexts, including bison, antelope, deer,
and dogs. Dog burials have been recorded from many late prehistoric pueblo sites in the U.S.
Southwest (Olsen 1968:33); however, there were no known articulated dog burials uncovered
during any of the excavations at Merchant. Speth (2004b) reported no dog burials from the
Henderson site near Roswell, nor have any been reported from any of the other Roswell sites.
The burial of dogs appears to be a ritualistic practice not embraced by the pueblo and pithouse
village societies in southeast New Mexico. However, Speth (2004b) does suggest that dogs were
utilized at Henderson as a valued food source during communal feasts and ceremonies (Bigelow
and Speth 2004:222-223), and they could have served a similar function at Merchant.
Artiodactyls almost certainly functioned in ritual, in addition to their role as a source of food and
hides. The notched bones (bone rasps) recovered from various contexts throughout the site
during the LCAS excavations probably functioned as a form of musical instrument during
ceremonies. They also could have been used as grave goods. No burials have been uncovered at
or directly near the Merchant site, but Leslie (n.d.) did uncover a human burial at the Bell Lake
site that contained a complete deer or pronghorn bone rasp associated with the burial. Bone rasps
also have been found in ceremonial contexts throughout the greater region, such as at Paquimé,
where a bison rib bone rasp was located in the stairway of the walk-in-well (Di Peso et al.
1974:4:377-379).
Artiodactyl bones also appear to have been used in a ceremonial closure of Pit Structure 1. Leslie
(n.d.; also personal communication 1984) noted encountering an approximately 12-inch thick
layer of almost solid bone in Zone E of this structure during the LCAS excavation (see Chapter
Six). He described the layer as predominantly consisting of large mammal remains and
specifically notes the presence of bison and deer/pronghorn bones and teeth among the remains.
Leslie (personal communication 1984) also stated in his unpublished manuscript on the Merchant
site that the large mammal bones from Zone E appeared to have been deposited individually and
purposefully, as opposed to the animal remains present in other layers of Pit Structure 1 that were
more indicative of regular accumulations of trash. Thus, it seems that bones from medium and
large ungulates were accumulated, either over time or during a large feasting ceremony, and
deliberately placed within Pit Structure 1 as a ritual deposit.
All but one of the identified dog/coyote bones was recovered from fill associated with Pit
Structure 1. Unfortunately, Leslie did not specifically document finding canid remains within the
dense bone layer. As such, it is impossible to determine if these bones were deposited
ceremonially during the closing of Pit Structure 1 or if they are merely common refuse that
accumulated within the structure at a different time.

Summary
The faunal assemblage recovered from Merchant during the 2015 excavation is in most aspects
similar to assemblages recovered from other late prehistoric archaeological sites located along the
Pecos River valley and on the plains of southeastern New Mexico and west Texas. The animal
remains composing these assemblages are all dominated by lagomorphs and artiodactyls and are
reflective of the natural environments of these regions. Bison, deer, and pronghorn were likely
present in great numbers on the plains throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and were
certainly important to the indigenous peoples that established and occupied these pueblos. Large
284

Chapter Eleven
Faunal Remains from the Merchant Site

mammals served as a valuable source for food and hides to the local populations and also
probably as an important trade commodity. Meat and hides from these animals were likely traded
into pueblos in the Sierra Blanca region in exchange for items from the west, such as ceramics,
obsidian, and other perishable items.
In addition to their value as food and trade commodities, large mammals, and possibly dogs,
appear to have been utilized for important ritual purposes as well. The solid layer of bone
documented by Leslie in Pit Structure 1 is almost certainly ritualistic in nature and was probably
deliberately placed as an offering during the ceremonial closing of the structure.

The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site
Myles R. Miller, Tim Graves, and Robert H. Leslie

The material culture of the Merchant site holds several keys to understanding the nature of
settlement and subsistence, the economic and social relationships of the inhabitants with those
residing in adjacent regions, and the social identity of the inhabitants themselves. The projectile
point, ceramic, and chipped and ground tool assemblages from the Merchant site are reviewed in
the following chapter. Again, it must be reiterated that the presentation, discussion, and analysis
of material culture from the Merchant site is conditioned by the fact that the entire collection of
projectile points, ceramics, groundstone, and other artifacts excavated and collected by Leslie and
the LCAS was lost. The materials cannot be reexamined to check for typological or provenience
inconsistencies or reanalyzed using modern analytical attributes and techniques. The only record
of the artifacts is contained within Leslie’s manuscript and the photographic archive of black-andwhite contact sheets and color slides. These images have been enhanced and incorporated
wherever possible, but many artifact classes and types are missing from the photographic record.
To some degree the 2015 excavations helped to remedy this unfortunate situation. Most of the
primary artifact classes, with the exception of freshwater and marine shell, were recovered during
the excavations in refuse areas and the backdirt deposits in the two pit structures. Additionally,
most of the artifact types within the classes were recovered, although there are some notable
discrepancies between the proportions of certain types, as well as the fact that some ceramic types
reported by Leslie are absent from the 2015 ceramic assemblage.
The projectile point collections are reviewed first, followed by the ceramic assemblages. The
chipped and groundstone tool collections are briefly described, and the small collection of shell
artifacts is presented at the end of the chapter.
Errors in Artifact Counts
Provenience tabulations for projectile point types, ceramic types, and other artifact classes are
provided in this chapter. As part of the analysis and review process, Tim Graves created data
files that list the artifact counts for each provenience described in Leslie’s manuscript. In other
words, a database was created listing the counts for all artifact types for each domestic room, the
two pit structures, and the four refuse areas. When we tallied the counts for projectile points,
ceramics, and other types, we discovered that our totals differed from the totals in Leslie’s
summary tables.
We have been unable to determine the source of the errors in Leslie’s summary tables. At first
we thought that perhaps Leslie had included miscellaneous contexts and collections beyond the
domestic rooms, pit structures, and refuse areas. This explanation does not work because his
tables have counts that are both greater and fewer than our totals. If he had included other
287

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

contexts, his tabulated totals would have all been greater in number. The most parsimonious
explanation is that Leslie simply made some errors while adding up the artifact counts from the
21 provenience descriptions in his manuscript, as well as the various stratigraphic zones within
specific proveniences. Accordingly, the artifact totals presented in this chapter are based on the
sums of the 21 individual provenience descriptions (and stratigraphic zones if present) in the
manuscript. The corrected provenience tables in this chapter provide the data for stratigraphic
and spatial analyses of projectile points and ceramics presented in the following interpretative
chapters.

The Projectile Point Assemblages from the Merchant Site
One of the more significant aspects of the Merchant site is the exceptionally high number of
projectile points recovered by the LCAS excavators from 1959 to 1965. Leslie describes the type
assignment and general provenience of 1,608 projectile points recovered from the pit structures,
domestic rooms, and refuse areas of the village area. This total is even more striking considering
that an unknown number of points, perhaps a thousand or more, were looted from those deposits
before they were documented by Leslie and the LCAS. In his 1965 article, Leslie (1965a:28)
states that, based on statements from several informants, over 3,000 points were collected from
the site. Points were recovered from domestic rooms, extramural refuse areas, pit structure floors,
and hundreds were present throughout the fill deposits of the two pit structures (Figure 12.1).
During the 2015 excavations, a count of 89 projectile points was recovered from backdirt deposits
that had been thoroughly screened (sometimes more than once) by LCAS members and looters.

288

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

The projectile point assemblages are examined in some detail in the following discussion. It is
important to keep in mind that the collections were lost, and therefore Leslie’s manuscript and his
photographic archive are the only records of the dart and arrow point collections. We have
incorporated enhanced versions of Leslie’s photographs and line drawings wherever possible.
Leslie applied his southeastern New Mexico typology (Leslie 1978) to the projectile specimens
from the Merchant site. His types, designated Type 1, Type 2, and so forth, were based on the
basic morphological attributes of size, blade shape, basal form, and presence or absence of
notches. Each type has one or more subtypes such as Type 1-A or Type 2-C that were defined on
minor variations in basal form, notch location, and the number of notches.
Leslie’s classification has the benefit of being a relatively objective approach that avoids the
ambiguities and errors in type names and production dates that often arise when extra-regional
projectile point taxonomies are utilized. On the other hand, some caution must be exercised in
using Leslie’s taxonomy because it can lead to an erroneous impression that all points classified
within a type are related to each other. In other words, certain projectile point types that are
chronologically and/or geographically unrelated may be subsumed within a single type. For
example, Leslie’s Type 1 includes one subtype that would be classified as Fresno or Cottonwood
Triangular and another that would be assigned to the Garza/Soto type, both of which were
produced at different times in the Southwest and southern Plains.
The review and analysis of projectile points from the 1959–1965 LCAS excavations and 2015
excavations are arranged by Leslie’s typology and includes observations on each type from his
unpublished manuscript. Line drawings of each type from Leslie’s manuscript and photographs,
if available, are included among the type descriptions. The typology and implications of the
typological variation of the projectile assemblage will be reviewed at the end of the section.
More detailed spatial and stratigraphic analyses of the projectile point types and their
distributions at the Merchant site are reviewed in Chapter Thirteen.
Leslie Type 1
Analogs: Fresno, Cottonwood Triangular, Young, and Garza/Soto
General morphology and variation: Triangular to ovate blade with no side or corner notches,
although one subtype has a wide basal notch. Four subtypes based on minor variations of the
base: Type 1-A has a convex base, Type 1-B has a straight base, Type 1-C a concave base, and
Type 1-D is characterized by a wide notch or V-shaped concave base similar to the Garza and
Soto forms.
There is some debate over whether this form served as preforms or blanks for other triangular
projectile forms. Leslie states that a “large number” of the Type 1 points from Merchant
appeared to be manufacturing failures but also notes that some of the specimens were basal
fragments removed from shafts. The sample of Type 1 points recovered during the 2015
excavations includes a few specimens with impact fractures, indicating their use as hafted
projectiles.

289

Type 1-A (Figure 12.2)
Blade: Sub-triangular or ovate with slightly convex or straight sides
Notches: None
Base: Convex
Length: range 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm, average of 2.3 cm
Width: range 1.0 cm to 1.7 cm, average of 1.4 cm
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.4 cm
Comments: Type 1-A was one of the least common variants. Leslie suggests it is a late type and
appeared at the site in tandem with Type 1-D and Type 2-F (Garza/Soto and Toyah forms).
However, Leslie also notes that this style, along with several styles of arrow points with convex
bases, were common on sites occupied during the Querecho and Maljamar Phases that precede
the Ochoa phase occupation of the Merchant site. Leslie suggests that this type is more common
in the western Jornada, but an examination of the literature finds few examples of this type
among western and northern Jornada pithouse and pueblo settlements.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Comments: Type 1-B was found throughout the site and within all of Leslie’s proposed
occupational periods. Like Type 1-A, this type first appeared in the eastern Jornada area along
with the first straight base corner-notched arrow points and continued throughout all of the
ceramic and arrow point periods until the abandonment of the Merchant Site and end of the
Ochoa phase. Leslie suggests it was a possible preform for Type 2-B and Type 2-D. It has
morphological similarities to the Fresno type (Suhm and Jelks 1962) and Cottonwood Triangular
Cluster (Justice 2002) consisting of a wide range of morphologically similar or identical types
across the western United States, Texas, and northeastern Mexico. It is common among Jornada
pueblos in the Sacramento Mountains or Roswell region (Adler and Speth 2004; Kelley 1984;
Miller and Graves 2009; Wiseman 2002).
Type 1-C (Figure 12.4)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex, straight, and recurved sides. Recurved edges were more
common among this variant
Notches: None
Base: Slight to moderately concave. A number of specimens are flared at the base.
Length: range 1.6 cm to 3.5 cm, average of 2.5 cm
Width: range 1.0 cm to 1.8 cm, average of 1.4 cm
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.3 cm
Comments: Type 1-C was the most common subtype of Type 1 points at the Merchant site and
throughout southeastern New Mexico. It first appeared within the eastern Jornada along with
Type 2-C as the first concave base arrow point style beginning in A.D. 1200 until the
abandonment of the Merchant site and end of the Ochoa phase. Type 1-C differs from Type 1-B
only by having a concave rather than straight base, and Leslie suggests both types may have been
preforms for Type 2-B and Type 2-D points. It has morphological similarities to the Fresno type
(Suhm and Jelks 1962) and Cottonwood Triangular Cluster (Justice 2002) consisting of a wide
range of morphologically similar or identical types across the western United States, Texas, and
northeastern Mexico. It is common among Jornada pueblos in the Sacramento Mountains or
Roswell region (Adler and Speth 2004; Kelley 1984; Miller and Graves 2012; Wiseman 2002).

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Type 1-D (Figure 12.5)
Blade: Triangular with convex and straight sides, seldom recurved.
Notches: None
Based: Broad indentation or V-shaped concave base. Rare specimens have a concave base with a
central notch.
Length: range 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm, average of 2.5 cm
Width: range 1.0 cm to 1.6 cm, average of 1.2 cm
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm, average of 0.4 cm
Comments: Leslie suggests that Type 1-D first appeared in the eastern Jornada near the end of
the Merchant site occupation and Ochoa phase, possibly sometime after A.D. 1400. It is
interesting in that he notes that Type 1-D points were not found at any other Ochoa phase sites in
the local area.
The Type 1-D points have morphological similarities to Garza (Runkles 1964) and Soto (Fritz
1969; Krone 1979; Phelps 1964, 1987). Garza points are common across the southern Llano
Estacado but tend to be associated with occupations postdating A.D. 1500 (Johnson et al. 1977;
Parry and Speth 1984). Soto is a regional variant of Garza found at sites in the Trans-Pecos and
Big Bend regions of west Texas and the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Coahuila. Few
of the sites in Texas and Mexico have been dated and therefore the relationship between Soto and
Garza remains unclear, but given the morphological similarities, it is likely they are the same
type. Turner and Hester (1999) suggest that Garza is a variant of Toyah, and Leslie suggests that
Type 1-D was a preform stage for Type 2-F, the local Toyah analog. Whether Type 1-D
represents Garza, Soto, or a Toyah preform, the presence of this type at the Merchant site is
intriguing and may indicate that a later component is present.
Leslie Type 2
Analogs: Harrell, Washita, Desert, Toyah, Pueblo Side-Notched Cluster
General morphology and variation: Triangular blade with slightly convex or straight sides and
well-defined corner notches. Two of the subtypes have well-defined basal notches. The subtypes
were defined on variations in basal form and basal notches: Type 2-A has a convex base, Type 2B has a flat base, and Type 2-C has a concave base. The other three subtypes have some form of
notch or indentation in the base: Type 2-D has a flat base with a central notch, and Type 2-E has
a concave base with central notch. Type 2-F is characterized by an irregular or serrated blade
with somewhat rounded side notches and two basal configurations: an indented base or a
concave V-shaped concave base. Type 2-F is similar to the Toyah type and could be assigned to
a different group than Type 2 but has been retained in Type 2 to maintain consistency with
Leslie’s classification.

Figure 12.5. Photograph and drawing of Type 1-D points from the Merchant site. The specimen labeled E481 in the bottom row of the photograph is from Merchant, but an unknown number of the points in the
photograph are from other sites in southeast New Mexico.

The Type 2 subtypes can be assigned to the broader Pueblo Side-Notched Cluster of the
Southwest (Justice 2002). However, Justice’s typology is centered on the Southwest and does not
take into account similar or identical morphological variants on the southern Plains and
throughout Texas that have been conventionally assigned to the Harrell and Washita types.
Moreover, the two subtypes lacking basal notches may be separated from the two subtypes with
basal notches, or what is sometimes referred to as a “tri-notch” form.
Type 2-A
Type 2-A is a variant having a convex base and relatively wide and rounded side notches. It
resembles types found at earlier Maljamar phase components in the Jornada and southeastern
New Mexico (e.g., the Boot Hill site; Corley and Leslie 1960) and was not present at the
Merchant site.

295

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Type 2-B (Figure 12.6)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex or straight sides
Notches: Side opposed
Base: Straight
Length: range 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm, average of 2.5 cm
Width: range 1.2 cm to 2.2 cm, average of 1.5 cm
Thickness: range 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.4 cm
Comments: Type 2-B is one of the most common forms of side-notched points in southeastern
New Mexico as well as the Southwest and southern Plains, although Leslie suggests it is much
less common that the similar Type 2-C. As seen in Figure 12.6, there is some degree of variation
in the shape of the base for this subtype, and while the line drawings show a series of specimens
with straight bases, the photograph of this type displays a series of points with slightly concave
base configurations. Leslie offers some insight into this apparent discrepancy, noting that the
classification criterion of a straight base was overly restrictive and some slight variations in
concave and convex shapes were assigned to this subtype. Accordingly, there is probably enough
overlap between Type 2-B and 2-C (see below) to propose that both forms might be considered a
single type and can be classified under the definition of Washita (Bell 1958). Combined with
Type 2-C, this side-notched triangular form is the most common arrow point found at pueblo
settlements in the northern Jornada and Roswell area (Adler and Speth 2004; Kelley 1984; Miller
and Graves 2009; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wiseman 2002).
Type 2-C (Figure 12.7)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex, straight, or recurved sides
Notches: Side opposed
Base: Concave, ranging from slight to deep curves
Length: range 1.8 cm to 3.2 cm, average of 2.5 cm
Width: range 0.9 cm to 1.8 cm, average of 1.5 cm
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.3 cm
Comments: Type 2-C is the most common of the Type 2 points, as well as all projectile point
types, at the Merchant site and is also one of the most common forms of side-notched arrow
points across the Southwest and Plains. Leslie suggests the type arrives in southeastern New
Mexico late in the Maljamar phase around A.D. 1250 and notes it is common throughout Late
Prehistoric and early historic components of the Southwest and southern Plains.
As noted above, Type 2-C differs from Type 2-B solely on the basis of having a more pronounced
concave base, and it is here suggested that the two forms should be considered a single type
classified under the definition of Washita (Bell 1958). The combined Type 2-B/C projectile point
is the most common arrow point found at pueblo settlements in the northern Jornada and Roswell
area (Adler and Speth 2004; Kelley 1984; Miller and Graves 2009; Speth and Newlander 2012;
Wiseman 2002).

Type 2-D (Figure 12.8)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex or straight sides. Recurved edges are rare.
Notches: Side opposed
Base: Straight with center notch
Length: range 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm, average of 2.2 cm
Width: range 1.0 cm to 1.7 cm, average of 1.5 cm. It is usually widest at base.
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.3 cm
Comments: Leslie suggests that Type 2-D, along with similar basally-notched forms 2-E and 2-F,
appeared late in the occupation of the Merchant site around A.D. 1400 or later and notes that these
subtypes of 2 are absent among earlier (pre-A.D. 1400?) settlements in southeastern New Mexico.
Type 2-D (and Type 2-E below) is differentiated from Type 2-B/C on the basis of having a notch
in the straight base. A search of the Merchant site photographic archive found only two examples
that could be classified as Type 2-D (Figure 12.8). Unlike all of the other forms that had at least
one photograph showing multiple examples of a type arranged in rows, there was no such
dedicated photograph for this subtype. It is unclear if this was an oversight, if the photograph
image was lost, or if there were very few representative specimens. As with the proposed
combination of Types 2-B and 2-C mentioned above, it is here proposed that Type 2-D and 2-E
should be combined into a single type under the reference of Harrell (Bell 1958; Suhm and Jelks
1962).

isolated examples of side-notched points with a notched flat base were present in the photographic archive.

Type 2-E (Figure 12.9)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex sides, occasionally recurved.
Notches: Side opposed
Base: Straight to deeply concave with center notch
Length: range 1.7 cm to 4.2 cm, average of 2.8 cm
Width: range 1.3 cm to 2.2 cm, average of 1.6 cm.
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm, average of 0.3 cm
Comments: Type 2-E is one of the more common subtypes and was recovered from most
contexts at the Merchant site. Leslie suggests that the type was associated with the final
occupation (Period 3, surface rooms) of the site, but it should be noted that Type 2-E points were
found in most contexts with the exception of the lower refuse deposits and floor (Floor 1) of Pit
Structure 1. As noted above, Type 2-E differs from Type 2-D solely on the basis of having a
concave (or a more pronounced concave), base and there is probably enough overlap between the
types to suggest that the two forms should be considered a single type (Type 2-D/E) classified
under the definition of Harrell (Bell 1958; Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Type 2-F (Figure 12.10)
Blade: Triangular with slightly convex or straight sides, with several examples having irregular or
serrated blade edges
Notches: Side opposed
Base: Indented or deep V-notch
Length: range 2 cm to 4 cm, average of 2.5 cm
Width: range 1.2 cm to 1.6 cm (usually widest at base), average of 1.5 cm.
Thickness: range 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm, average of 0.4 cm
Comments: Leslie considers Type 2-F another of the late types at the Merchant site and
characteristic of the last decades of the Ochoa phase. Leslie further subdivided Type 2-F into two
varieties, one having an indented base and the second having a broad V-notch shape. Examining
the variation in Figure 12.10, it is questionable whether these variations are consistent enough to
warrant separation. Leslie even notes that both varieties can be placed within the conventional
Toyah type based on the characteristic narrow serrated blade edges. Several of the V-notch
variants in Figure 12.10 share some general morphological similarities with Type 2-D but can be
differentiated on the basis of the narrow blade and neck widths. Most of Type 2-F specimens
would classify as Toyah (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1999).

Leslie Type 3
Type 3 points were found in small numbers among various contexts at the Merchant site. Most of
the types and subtypes are considered to pre-date the A.D. 1300 occupation of the site, and it is
likely that the points were scavenged and recycled from earlier settlements in the vicinity of the
Merchant site. Leslie notes that Type 3 points were usually recovered from occupations in
southeastern New Mexico dating between A.D. 1000 and 1200.
Type 3 is a group of thin, stemmed, corner-notched arrow points. Several well-known types of
different time periods were subsumed within Type 3, and it should be considered a catch-all
category for stemmed, corner-notch arrow points. Leslie (1978) identified six subtypes, three of
which were recovered at the Merchant site. Of the 19 Type 3 specimens from Merchant, 6 were
classified to a subtype, and the remaining 13 points were identified only as Type 3. The six
classified points and subtype classifications are illustrated in Figure 12.11 (only one Type 3
specimen from the Merchant site [LCAS E-4] was found among the photographic archive).
Type 3-A (Figure 12.11 a, b, c): thin corner-notched arrow points with expanding stems and
convex bases. Leslie notes that Type 3-A is usually associated with early plain brownwares, redon-brown sherds and occasional Mimbres and Chupadero Black-on-white sherds.
Type 3-E (Figure 12.11 d): long slender blade with barbs projecting from the blade at right
angles and a straight narrow stem. Type 3-E is typical of the Livermore type (Suhm and Jelks
(1962) and perhaps is a variant lacking a serrated blade.
Type 3-F (Figure 12.11 e, f): similar to Type 3-E with long slender blade with serrated edges
and a slightly expanding stem with a convex base. Type 3-F is also typical of the classic
Livermore type with a serrated blade.

Leslie Type 8 Dart Points
The final category includes 32 dart points recovered from the Merchant site. Leslie classified 31
of the specimens as Type 8. The one exception is a contracting stem type typical of Middle
Archaic occupations across the western United States as was undoubtedly scavenged from an
earlier occupation in the vicinity.
Type 8 is a group of stemmed, corner-notched dart points with straight or convex bases. As with
Type 3, Leslie subsumed several well-known types of different time periods within Type 8, and
accordingly, it should be considered a general category of stemmed, corner-notched, flat/convex
base dart points. Leslie (1978) identified four subtypes among the Merchant site collection.
Most of the subtypes are considered to pre-date the A.D. 1300 occupation of the site, and it is
303

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

likely that the points were scavenged and recycled from earlier settlements in the vicinity of the
Merchant site.
Of the 31 Type 8 specimens, 15 were classified as Type 8-D and 9 were classified only as Type 8
without a subtype designation (most of these were reworked). The remaining 7 points were
classified as Types 8-A, 8-B, and 8-C. These subtypes are illustrated in Figure 12.12 and Figure
12.13 (one Type 8-C specimen and six Type 8-D points from the Merchant site [LCAS E-4]
could confidently be identified among the photographic archive).
Type 8-A (Figure 12.12 a and b): corner-notched dart with expanding stem and convex base.
The length of this type is usually about 3.5 cm and the width about 2.5 cm. This is the most
common style of Type 8 points throughout the western and eastern Jornada regions and would be
classified as Ellis according to the central Texas sequence (Suhm and Jelks (1962).
Type 8-B (Figure 12.12 c and d): similar to Type 8-A with a corner notch, expanding stem,
straight or slightly convex base, and prominent shoulder barbs. This type would also be classified
as the Ellis type. Types 8-A and 8-B could be combined.
Type 8-C (Figure 12.12 e ,f, g): prominent shoulders with barbs, corner notches, and rounded
convex bases. This type is common throughout the western and eastern Jornada regions and
would be classified as Palmillas or Williams types (Suhm and Jelks 1962).

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Type 8-D (Carlsbad Point) (Figure 12.13): Type 8-D is the most common dart form recovered
from the Merchant site. In his manuscript Leslie devoted some attention to this type despite the
fact that the type is generally associated with occupations that predate the Merchant site by
several centuries. The Carlsbad point is based on Leslie’s (1978:133) definition:
Blade: Triangular with convex, straight, or concave margins, sometimes with different shapes on
two sides of the same point. Reworked and resharpened blades are very common, and the blades
of many specimens have been reworked into small nubs. Leslie notes that dull edges were
present on some specimens, indicating their use as hafted bifaces.
Shoulder: pronounced shoulders with strong barbs
Notches: Leslie describes the location of the notches as “corner wide.” Most specimens have
deep corner notches angled in such a manner so that some specimens with broken barbs appear to
have a combination of side and corner-notching.
Base: Some of the photographed and drawn examples have straight bases, but the majority of
Type 8-D Carlsbad points have a strongly convex base. It is also clear that the base and notches
were created from an oval or ovate preform and retain the rounded base of that preform shape.
Length: range 3.0 cm to 6.0 cm, average of 5.0 cm
Width: range 2.0 cm to 2.5 cm, average of 2.4 cm at the shoulder
Thickness: range 0.4 cm to 0.9 cm, average of 0.6 cm

most of the specimens.

305

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Comments: Leslie notes that his examination of thousands of projectile points from private
collections in southeast New Mexico found that this type was one of the most common within a
100-mile radius of Carlsbad, New Mexico, but was rarely found in collections outside that radius
in the Trans-Pecos and Panhandle of Texas and the western Jornada. A review of projectile point
collections from the Jornada does confirm that points with similar base and notch configurations
are rare.
One of the more common attributes of this type is extensively worn and reworked blades. Most
of the examples from the Merchant site (see Figure 12.13) have heavily worn and reworked
blades, several of which are clearly asymmetrical with the length of the haft element. Leslie
notes that 8 of the 15 specimens had missing tips but the blade margins continued to be utilized.
All of the specimens had at least some evidence of reworked blades and wear patterns. Parry and
Speth (1984) describe similar patterns of reuse and reworking on a large collection of
morphologically similar points from the Garnsey Spring site near Roswell, noting that the points
“appear to have been used for a variety of heavy cutting, scraping and piercing tasks, and
probably did not serve exclusively or even primarily as weapon points” (Parry and Speth
1984:56). Leslie also notes that a much greater variety of raw materials were used for Carlsbad
points, including material sources located as far as the Guadalupe and Sacramento mountains.
Together, these data suggest that Type 8-D points were more commonly used as tools and were
scavenged from earlier sites in the vicinity. They most commonly appear on aceramic sites in the
region, and Leslie suggests a production date before A.D. 900.
Projectile Points from the 2015 Excavations
Ninety-eight projectile points or point fragments were recovered during the 2015 excavations in
the two pit structures and refuse areas of the Merchant site. This is a rather remarkable number
given that the backdirt deposits had been thoroughly screened and picked through by the LCAS
members and looters. Of the total, 39 consisted of tips, fragments, or otherwise unidentifiable
specimens. Fifty-seven points could be assigned to one of Leslie’s types and two were classified
as other forms that do not match Leslie’s types.
The types generally match those recovered during the 1959–1965 LCAS excavations and
documented by Leslie, although the proportions of the types vary somewhat. Projectile point
Types 1-B and 1-C have been combined into a single Type 1-B/C (Fresno) group, and this
collection is illustrated in Figure 12.14, along with one of the few examples of a Type 1-A point.
Many of the Type 1 points are broken along the distal or medial segments. It is difficult to
determine if they are manufacturing or impact breaks, although several of the broken and
unbroken items are relatively thick and crude, suggesting they were either preforms or an early
manufacturing stage.
Several of Leslie’s Type 2 subtypes were also combined. Types 2-B and 2-C have been
combined into Type 2-B/C (Washita) and Types 2-D and 2-E have been subsumed within Type 2D/E (Harrell). Examples of Type 2 points are illustrated in Figure 12.15. These three types
account for 37 of the 57 (65 percent) specimens of the 2015 collection that could be assigned to a
specific type. It is clear that Type 2-B/C (Washita) points are by far the most common of the
Type 2 subtypes.

No examples of Type 3 points were recovered during the 2015 fieldwork. It is possible that one
or more Type 3 points are represented among the several small tips and fragments in the
collection, but none of the classified points were assigned to this type. On the other hand, five
dart points similar to the Leslie’s Type 8 group were recovered (Figure 12.16). A sixth dart point
308

(Figure 12.16, lower right) does not match any of Leslie’s types at the Merchant site. Only one of
the six dart points was recovered from the LCAS village area. Notably, this single specimen has
a heavily reworked tip and dull blade margins and had been scavenged and recycled as a tool.
The other five dart points were recovered durign the excavations of possible agricutlural features
or during surface collections across isolated areas of the site.

Projectile Point Provenience and Comparative Data
Two general conclusions can be drawn from the review of the projectile point collections from
the 1959–1965 LCAS excavations and 2015 fieldwork. First, the LCAS village area is almost
entirely a small arrow point assemblage. It is unlikely that dart points were associated with the
village settlement and probably represent scavenging and recycling behaviors. Second, the arrow
point collections include several subtypes. The arrow point assemblage consists predominantly
of Fresno (Type 1-B/C) and Washita (Type 2-B/C) points, with small numbers of Harrell and
possible Garza and Toyah points. Projectile point counts for the LCAS proveniences and the
2015 excavations are listed in Table 12.1 and Table 12.2 below.

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Before proceeding with more intensive quantitative analyses, it is first necessary to compare the
projectile point assemblages recovered during the 1959–1965 LCAS excavations against the
assemblage collected during the 2015 excavations. Reiterating that the majority of the 2015
excavations focused on backdirt deposits that had been screened and selectively collected for
certain artifact classes by the LCAS crews (and looters), it is possible that the proportions of
projectile point types may have been affected by collection bias. In previous chapters we have
noted biases in certain material classes, such as the extreme discrepancies between the numbers
and weights of animal bone opposed to projectile point counts per cubic meter volume present in
the LCAS artifact tables and recovered during the 2015 fieldwork. If technical, attribute, and
compositional studies are to be conducted on the 2015 assemblages, the nature of bias among
those collections must first be understood.
In order to assess potential assemblage bias among the projectile points, the collections from Pit
Structure 1 will be utilized. Pit Structure 1 was selected because it has by far the greatest sample
numbers of projectile points for both the LCAS and the 2015 excavations. A review of Table
12.2 finds that of the six major contexts investigated during the 2015 fieldwork, only Pit Structure
1 has a sample of projectile points greater than six. Moreover, it is reasonably certain that the
deposits excavated in Pit Structure 1 during the 2015 fieldwork are the same that were excavated
and screened by the LCAS in 1959, and thus we have a relatively direct comparison of 2015
recovery rates for artifact types as opposed to the original excavations in the 1960s. The
proportions of the 11 projectile point types recovered from Pit Structure 1 are graphed in Figure
12.17. The upper fill and floor, lower fill and floor, and total proportions of points in the LCAS
collection are shown, along with the proportions of point types identified in the 2015 assemblage.
A close inspection of Figure 12.17 finds that there is a remarkable degree of concordance
between the 1959-1965 collection and 2015 collection for many of the projectile point types.
There is very little proportional variation among minor types such as 1-A, 1-D, 2-D, 2-E, 2-F, 3,
and 8 between the LCAS and 2015 collections, and what little variation does exist can be readily
attributed to stochastic (random) sampling bias.
However, there are two rather pronounced differences among the more common types (1-B, 1-C,
2-B, and 2-C). The 2015 assemblage has greater proportions of Type 1-B and 1-C (Fresno)
points and lower proportions of Type 2-B and 2-C (Washita) points. If these types are combined
as proposed earlier in this chapter, the 2015 collection has more Type 1-B/C (Fresno) points
(+11.6 differences) and fewer Type 2-B/C (Washita) points (-18.1 difference). A two-tailed
difference of proportions test (Sokal and Rohlf 2012) determines that the differences among the
two collections for the proportions of Fresno points is not significant (p=.147) while the
difference for Washita is significant (p=.019).
Several explanations may account for these discrepancies, but we feel that two are the most
realistic. First, the 2015 collection of Type 1-B/C (Fresno) points includes quite a few crude
preforms and broken specimens (see Figure 12.14), and perhaps these were discarded by the
looters and LCAS crew who were often pursing the “pretties and goodies” as phrased by Leslie.
Few of the specimens in Figure 12.14 would be considered collectible. If such items were tossed
into the backdirt, the presence of several discarded specimens would inflate the proportions of
Fresno points recovered during the 2015 excavation of Pit Structure 1. Recalling that the sample
size of classified points is only 43, the presence of 5 or 10 discarded crude Fresno points would
easily skew their proportional representation by 10 or 20 percent. So we suggest that the
assemblage from the screened backdirt has a higher proportion of discarded crude Fresno blanks
and fragments. A second explanation is that it is possible that our classification criterion for what
constitutes a basal notch may differ from that used by Leslie, and thus our counts of Type 2-B/C
points may have been biased accordingly.

Figure 12.17. Comparison of projectile point types recovered from Pit Structure 1 during the 1959 LCAS
and 2015 excavations.

A related issue is the extremely low number of unidentified or unclassified points in Leslie’s
tables. Leslie lists a total of only 7 specimens as “untyped,” a count that represents 0.4 percent of
the 1,608 points he examined. In stark contrast 39 of the 98 points recovered in 2015 are
unclassified, a proportion of 39.8 percent. The unclassified specimens in the 2015 collection
include small tip, medial blade, or basal fragments as well as several irregular and highly
reworked specimens that cannot be assigned to a type with confidence. Given the disparity in the
proportions of unclassified specimens in the two collections, it can be reasonably concluded that
the LCAS excavators and looters retained only complete or mostly complete projectile points and
returned small fragments to the backdirt piles along with animal bone and chipped stone debitage.
Aside from the issues of inter-assemblage biases, some intriguing stratigraphic differences can be
seen in the distributions of projectile point types in Pit Structure 1. As proposed in this chapter,
several of the subtype classifications based on minor differences in the shape of the base have
been combined. These types also correlate with conventional type names used in Texas, New
Mexico, the Plains, and elsewhere. Types 1-B and C are combined into Type 1-B/C and referred
to as Fresno. Types 2-B and C are combined into Type 2-BC and are collectively known as
Washita points, while Types 2-D and E are combined into Type 2-D/E and match the Harrell
type.
The proportional distributions of these types among the upper fill, lower fill, total assemblage,
and 2015 assemblage from Pit Structure 1 are shown in Figure 12.18. Again, the different
proportions of Fresno and Washita between the LCAS and 2015 collection are apparent. What is
more intriguing is the absence of certain point types in the lower fill and floor context of the
structure. Type 1-A, 1-D (Garza), 2-D (Harrell), and 2-F (Toyah) are indicated by textured red
bars in the figure, and each of these types is absent in the lower fill and floor strata (Zones H and
I) of the structure. These patterns are explored in greater detail in the Chapter Thirteen.

The Ceramic Assemblage from the Merchant Site
Ceramic sherds were second only to bone in quantity and density among the rooms, pit structures,
and refuse areas at the Merchant site. Based on tabulations of Leslie’s provenience counts, a total
of 10,536 ceramic sherds was recovered from the domestic rooms, two pit structures, and four
refuse areas. During the 2015 excavations, 2,140 sherds were recovered from backdirt deposits in
the two pit structures that had previously been thoroughly screened by LCAS members and
looters. Additional ceramic collections were recovered from Refuse Areas A and B and a small
number from Feature 39.
The LCAS ceramic assemblage as tabulated by Leslie is listed in Table 12.3. The assemblage
was examined by John Runyan who was very familiar with El Paso Brownware (see Runyan and
Hedrick 1973) and other regional ceramic traditions. Accordingly, most of the type
identifications in Table 12.3 are considered reasonably secure and accurate.
At first glance it is apparent that the assemblage is dominated by Ochoa wares. This is a common
pattern, as most pithouse and pueblo settlements in the western Jornada have similar proportions
of locally-produced El Paso Brownware. Ochoa Indented Corrugated is the most common type,
with polished, corrugated, and smudged variants of Ochoa ware present in small quantities.
Twelve imported wares or types were identified in the LCAS collections. The majority of these
types are typical of ceramic assemblages from the southeastern Southwest during the fourteenth
and early fifteenth centuries. Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and
Lincoln Black-on-red were widely distributed throughout the western and northern Jornada
regions, western Trans-Pecos Texas, Chupadera Mesa, the Roswell “oasis,” and southeastern
317

New Mexico. Chupadero Black-on-white has an even broader distribution, having been recorded
at several sites on the southern Plains and the eastern Trans-Pecos.

Gila Polychrome (Roosevelt Redware) and Ramos Polychrome originate from regions a bit
further to the west, while El Paso Polychrome was produced throughout the Jornada region and
perhaps as far east as Culberson County (Miller and Ferguson 2014). Two varieties of Rio Grande
Glaze A were identified: Agua Fria Glaze-on-red and Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow. One type
remains unidentified. Leslie also describes two sherds of a highly polished black ware with
incised designs.
Roswell Brown and Roswell corrugated wares were thought to have been produced along the
Middle Pecos River in the vicinity of Roswell (Jelenik 1967). However, recent petrographic
analysis has identified several igneous rock types in Roswell Brown tempers, indicating that
production areas were located to the west of the Pecos Valley (Hill 2014; Wiseman 2004).
Moreover, based on an examination of numerous collections from southeastern New Mexico,
Wiseman (2012) concludes that Roswell Brown cannot be distinguished from Jornada
Brownware on the basis of temper and finish attributes. In this report, the previous identifications
of Roswell Brown sherds are described as Jornada/Roswell Brown.

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Ochoa Ware
Ochoa wares account for slightly over 95 percent of the LCAS ceramic assemblage. Ochoa
Indented Corrugated (often incorrectly shortened to Ochoa Indented) was first named and
described in the “Facts and Artifacts” Newsletter of the Lea County Archaeological Society
(Leslie 1965b). A second type description was provided in Michael Collin’s 1968 M.A. thesis on
the Andrews Lake Locality (Collins 1968). The type description developed by Leslie is based on
the materials excavated from the Merchant site, and, accordingly, Merchant is considered the
“type site” for the ware. Leslie notes that the name was taken from the nearby ghost town
community of Ochoa, a town known throughout the region during the Prohibition era and early
oil boom of the 1920s for producing bootleg “Ochoa Whiskey.”
Ochoa wares were distributed from southeastern Eddy County, across Lea County, and as far as
southeastern Chaves County in New Mexico and are also found in Loving, Winkler, Gaines,
Andrews, and Dawson counties of Trans-Pecos and panhandle Texas. The distribution is mostly
to the east of the Pecos River. Leslie originally proposed a production period of A.D. 1375 to
1425 based on associations with imported dated types, while Collins proposed a longer span of
A.D. 1300 to 1500. The dating of Ochoa wares has not improved with 50 years of more refined
production dates for imported wares. Based on the current knowledge of production spans for the
imported ceramics and the radiocarbon age estimates from the Merchant site (see Chapter Nine),
Ochoa wares were probably produced between A.D. 1300 and 1450 and possibly through the late
1400s.
Construction: Coil and scrape with smoothing and polishing of plain surfaces and the addition of
indentations on exterior corrugations.
Paste and texture: All vessels have a moderately compact to friable paste texture. Jar pastes
range from black to dark brown and light gray to tan. Jar exteriors have residues and darkened
exteriors resulting from use as cooking vessels. Bowls were not used as cooking vessels and have
a wider range of paste colors including gray, reddish-tan, light to dark tan, and light brown to
dark black. It is clear that the ware was produced under low-temperature reducing fires which
accounts for the wide range of variation in paste colors.
Temper: Leslie describes the temper of Ochoa ware as consisting of medium to very coarse
crushed caliche fragments. Some temper particles are so large (5 mm) that they protrude through
one and sometimes both surfaces of vessel walls, but most temper grains average 3 mm in size.
Intriguingly, Leslie notes that many of the larger temper grains are not caliche and have smooth
rounded edges on one or more sides. He suggests these are small crushed gravels that are usually
dark gray to black in color. A few small flakes of light colored biotite mica are present in some
sherds, as well as fine to medium rounded sand grains. Leslie notes all these materials are
available in local sandstone outcrops (such as the layer below the terrace of the Merchant site—
see Chapter Two) and suggests that crushed sandstone and crushed burned and unburned caliche
were being used to temper the Ochoa pastes.
Walls: Wall thickness varies from 0.4 to 1.0 cm. Most of the variation in thickness is attributable
to the depth of indentations. Leslie noted little difference in thickness between bowl and jar
sherds.
Exterior Surface Finish: Coils on the exterior of vessels are indented (Figure 12.19). Some
indentations are very uniform while others were irregular and haphazard (Figure 12.20). The
uniform indentations are more common on upper portions of vessels such as the necks and rims
of jars and rims of bowls. Various forms of rubbing, scraping, and raking of indentations can be

seen on many sherds, often resulting in the obliteration of the indentations and leaving an uneven
bumpy surface. The uniform indentations on necks graduate to rubbed and scraped finishes along
the shoulder and bottom of vessels. Leslie examined several hundred Ochoa Indented sherds and
concluded that the impressions were not formed through finger impressions but rather by the use
of small end scrapers.
Interior Surface Finish: Jar interiors are always smoothed and rarely polished. Bowls interiors
are semi-polished and seldom only smoothed. About 20 percent of bowl interiors have
intentional smudging with a well-executed polish.
Vessel Forms: Very few complete or reconstructed Ochoa ware vessels have been recovered, and
thus the range of size and shape of vessels is mostly unknown and must be inferred from restored
rim segments. Leslie notes that small- and medium-sized bowls are present, but the measurement
for those terms are not provided. Collins (1968:Figure 28) illustrates a partially reconstructed jar.
It is a globular form with a restricted neck and everted rim measuring 25 cm in height, 35 cm in
diameter, with an orifice diameter of 15.5 cm. Leslie suggests a similar form is the most common
jar represented among the Ochoa ware rims from the Merchant site. The most common jar form
was a globular jar with a short outcurved neck and everted rim with rounded lips. In addition,
Leslie notes that several sherds recovered from Refuse Area A and adjacent domestic rooms
could be reconstructed and formed a small jar with a rounded base, long neck, and flaring
constricted rim. Another rare form included jars with outcurved necks and straight rims. Based
on rim sherds and limited reconstruction of a few vessels, Leslie determined that two primary
bowl forms were present at Merchant: a medium-sized bowl with vertical walls and slightly
incurved rims with rounded lips, and a slightly smaller bowl with slightly outcurved walls and
straight rims with rounded or beveled lips.

321

The Merchant Site

Leslie describes several variants of Ochoa wares. All have identical manufacturing and firing
attributes to Ochoa Indented Corrugated but have variations in surface finish. Ochoa Plain has
smoothed and polished vessel exteriors. Ochoa Corrugated has partially smoothed coils similar to
Roswell Corrugated (see Figure 12.19). Ochoa Indented Corrugated Smudged is a subtype of
bowl vessels with smudged and polished interiors.
Imported Ceramics
Leslie’s classification and tabulation describes twelve imported ceramic wares or types.
Unfortunately, no photographs of these types could be found among in the archives, and only
three line drawings of Chupadero Black-on-white sherds were included in Leslie’s manuscript.
Due to the absence of photographs, the accuracy of the type identifications cannot be evaluated,
but it is reasonably certain that the majority of ceramics were correctly identified by Robert
Leslie and John Runyan.
The twelve types are well-represented throughout prehistoric southern New Mexico. Type
descriptions and discussions are available in numerous reports and articles and do not need to be
repeated here. The reader is referred to Wiseman (2002, 2004) and Wiseman et al. (1999) for
analysis and discussion of several of the most common imported types such as Three Rivers Redon-terracotta, Lincoln Black-on-red, Roswell brownwares, and Chupadero Black-on-white.
Descriptions and analyses of Chupadero Black-on-white are available in Mera (1931), Hayes
(1981), Wiseman (2014), Kelley (1984), and Clark (2006). El Paso Polychrome is reviewed by
Perttula et al. (1995), and Miller and Graves (2012) provide new neutron activation analysis
(NAA) data on Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta and Chupadero Black-on-white from southeastern
New Mexico. Roswell Brown and corrugated types were first described by Jelenik (1952, 1967);
more recent studies place this type within Jornada Brownware (Hill 2014; Wiseman 2012). The
original type description for Lincoln Black-on-red is provided Mera and Stallings (1931). Type
descriptions for Ramos Polychrome and Ramos Black are reviewed in Di Peso et al. (1974:6).
Finally, the most recent review of Rio Grande Glaze A and other glaze wares is available in
Wilson (2005).
Chupadero Black-on-white: The most common imported ware was Chupadero Black-on-white
(Figure 12.21) with 169 sherds (1.6 percent of the assemblage). Sherds were recovered from
Rooms 3, 4, 5, and 6, Refuse areas A, B, C, and D, Pit Structure 2, and the upper and lower
occupations of Pit Structure 1. Based on Leslie’s calculations, slightly over 20 percent of the
sherds derived from bowl vessels with the remainder from jars, proportions that generally match
those recorded at sites throughout southern New Mexico. Two jar handles were present. Most of
the bowl sherds were from a cache of sherds and other items outside Room 4 (Refuse Area D; see
Figure 5.4).
A recent NAA of Chupadero Black-on-white included two sherds from the Merchant site and one
from Andrew Lake. The three sherds could not be assigned to a known compositional group
(Clark 2006:184). Based on the NAA results from other sites in southeast New Mexico (Clark
2006; Miller and Graves 20012), it is likely that the vessels from which the sherds derived from
were produced somewhere in the Capitan/Sierra Blanca production region rather than the primary
Salinas production areas.

322

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Figure 12.21. Line drawings of Chupadero Black-on-white sherds from Refuse Area C.

El Paso Polychrome: Eighty-seven sherds of El Paso Polychrome were recovered from Rooms 3,
4, 5, 6, and 8, the two pit structures, and all refuse areas. All derived from jar vessels. Leslie
notes that many sherds were small and had only red or black paint or were unpainted. Under
modern classifications, these would be assigned, respectively, to the El Paso Decorated and El
Paso Undifferentiated Brownware types. The eighteen rim sherds were everted forms
characteristic of Classic El Paso Polychrome with production dates of A.D. 1300 to 1450 (Perttula
et al. 1995). Leslie makes a curious statement that Runyan identified gypsum and quartz sand
tempers among the El Paso Polychrome from Merchant and other sites in the area. Petrographic
studies of El Paso Polychrome ceramics found at sites in southeastern New Mexico have not
identified gypsum as a temper constituent (Hill 2014).
Roswell Plain and Corrugated Brownware: Leslie and Runyan identified twenty-nine sherds of
Roswell Plain and 11 sherds of Roswell Corrugated based on the type definitions of Jelenik
(1967). These types had a more restricted distribution than Chupadero and El Paso wares,
recovered only from Rooms 4 and 6, Refuse Areas B and C, and the lower occupation strata of Pit
Structure 1. Leslie makes an interesting statement that Roswell plain and corrugated brownwares
were not separated from Jornada Brownware in the Merchant collection, and that some of the
characteristic tempers of the latter type may have been present among the Roswell sherds. In
light of Hill’s petrographic studies and Wiseman’s conclusions regarding Roswell Brown, it is
likewise concluded that the Roswell Brown sherds identified by Leslie and Runyan were actually
Jornada Brownware. Additionally, the corrugated variety of Roswell brownware described as
having rubbed and semi-obliterated corrugations on bowl and jar exteriors must be a Late
Prehistoric corrugated ware from elsewhere in the Southwest.
Three Rivers Redware: Sixteen sherds of Three River Red-on-terracotta were recovered during
the LCAS excavations in Refuse Areas B, C, and D and the lower occupation strata of Pit
Structure 1. No sherds were found in the fills or floors of domestic rooms. Typical of this type,
all sherds from the Merchant site derived from bowls. Thirty-two sherds of Lincoln Black-on-red
323

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

were recovered from Room 8, all refuse areas, Pit Structure 2, and the upper and lower fills of Pit
Structure 1. All the sherds derived from bowls.
Roosevelt Redware: Thirty-three sherds were classified as Gila Polychrome. Both bowl and jar
sherds were present, indicating that more than one vessel was present at the site. Despite the
relatively small count of sherds, Gila Polychrome was recovered from Rooms 3, 4, and 5, Refuse
Areas B and C, Pit Structure 2, and the upper and lower occupation strata of Pit Structure 1.
Ramos Polychrome and Playas Red Incised: Two ceramic types produced in the Casas Grandes
region of northern Chihuahua were recovered. Nineteen Ramos Polychrome sherds were
recovered. Despite the small count, the sherds were widely distributed among Room 6, Refuse
Areas A, B, and C, Pit Structure 2, and the lower and upper occupation strata of Pit Structure 1.
Based on differences of rim shape and designs, Leslie suggests that two vessels are represented.
The ten Playas Red Incised sherds are from jar vessels. Based on similarities of firing, finish, and
decoration, Leslie suggests that the Playas Incised sherds derived from a single vessel. Sherds of
this type were found only in the lower occupation strata of Pit Structure 1 and Refuse Area C.
Rio Grande Glaze A: Seventy-eight sherds of Rio Grande Glaze A were recovered, making it the
third most common imported ceramic ware. Two types were identified: Agua Fria Glaze-on-red
(51 sherds) and Cieneguilla Glaze-on-yellow (27 sherds). Jar and bowl sherds of both types were
present. Sherds of these types were recovered from Rooms 3, 5, 8, and 21, Refuse Areas A, B,
and C, Pit Structure 2, and the upper and lower fills of Pit Structure 1. The nearest production
source of Glaze A ceramics was the Galisteo basin of New Mexico but Glaze A was produced
throughout central New Mexico. Leslie notes that Glaze A is one of the rarest types in
southeastern New Mexico. Collins (1968) describes a small collection of Glaze A sherds from
Andrews Lake, another Ochoa phase site located south of Merchant.
Classification of early Rio Grande Glazewares is based primarily on chronological changes in rim
form (Franklin 2007; Wilson 2005). Given that only 11 rim sherds were present, the
identification of the 67 body sherds was somewhat speculative on the part of Leslie and Runyan.
However, it could be assumed that the collection of body sherds derived from the same vessels as
the rim sherds.
Incised Polished Blackware: The final type described by Leslie is two sherds from the lower
occupation of Pit Structure 1 that had a highly polished black finish with incised designs. The
sherds were not classified. The surface finish resembles Ramos Black (Sayles 1936), several
sherds of which were recovered during the 2015 excavations in Refuse Area A and the backdirt of
Pit Structure 1. An incised variety of Ramos Black is described by Di Peso et al. (1974:6:160168), and it is here concluded that the two sherds described by Leslie can be assigned to Ramos
Black.
The 2015 Ceramic Assemblage
The 2015 excavations in pit structures and refuse areas recovered a total of 2,140 sherds. With
one notable exception—Rio Grande Glaze A—all the imported types described by Leslie were
recovered during the 2015 fieldwork (Table 12.4). Newly identified types include Jornada
Brownware, Ramos Black, and El Paso Undifferentiated Brownware. From the discussions
above, it is certain that sherds of each of these types were present among the LCAS collection but
were lumped with Roswell Brownware, Unidentified incised polished blackware, and El Paso
Polychrome, respectively, by Leslie and Runyan.

The individual proportions of Ochoa wares and imported wares documented among the 19591965 and 2015 investigations show some slight variations, but most of this variation is
attributable to the fact that 3.9 percent of the latter collection consisted of unclassified
brownwares as opposed to the LCAS collection that had no unclassified sherds. The most notable
difference among the two assemblages is the somewhat glaring absence of Rio Grande Glaze A
sherds in the 2015 collection.
Befitting the status of the Merchant site as the “type site” for Ochoa wares, the typical Ochoa
Indented Corrugated ceramics were recovered from all contexts and stratigraphic zones (Figure
12.22). Examples of the decorated imported types Chupadero Black-on-white, Ramos
Polychrome, Ramos Black, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and Lincoln Black-on-red are
illustrated in Figure 12.23.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

One of the most intriguing finds of the 2015 excavations is a small fragment of a patterned
incised brownware vessel recovered from Pit Structure 1 (Figure 12.24). The senior author
consulted with several ceramic specialists from the Caddo and Plains regions and none were able
to identify the sherd. The speculation is that it originates somewhere in the Midwestern or
southeastern United States.
Ceramic Provenience and Comparative Data
Detailed attribute analyses were not conducted on the ceramic assemblage, nor were any ceramic
sherds submitted for geochemical compositional analysis (NAA, ICP) and source identification.
The LCAS ceramic collection is lost and the 2015 collection consists mostly of Ochoa wares.
Moreover, attribute analyses and other intensive artifact analyses were not included among the
remedial mitigation tasks stipulated by the CFO in the Merchant project contract.

Aside from the typological analysis presented in this chapter, we can proceed with a comparative
analysis of the LCAS and 2015 collections in a similar manner to that conducted earlier on the
projectile point collections. If sometime in the future a series of technical, attribute, and
compositional studies are to be conducted on the 2015 ceramic assemblage, the nature of
collection biases among these collections of Ochoa and Chupadero and other types must first be
understood. Ceramic counts for the LCAS proveniences and the 2015 excavations are listed in
Table 12.5 and Table 12.6 below.

Chapter Twelve
The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

The first analysis compares the proportions of Ochoa wares (Figure 12.25). It is evident that the
proportions of Ochoa Indented Corrugated are highly consistent across all major proveniences
investigated by the LCAS. The 2015 collections show similar proportions of total Ochoa wares,
but have different proportions of some of the Ochoa variants, particularly the indented corrugated
smudged variety and plain polished variety. We do not consider this an example of collection
bias, but rather a factor of inter-analyst variability due to a greater familiarity with smudged
ceramic finishes. Examples of the smudged variety of Ochoa Indented Corrugated bowls are
provided in Figure 12.26.

333

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

The imported ceramic assemblages are compared in the Figure 12.27. The most striking
difference is the much higher proportion of undifferentiated brownware sherds and presence of
Jornada Brownware in the 2015 collection. As with the proportions of Ochoa wares discussed in
the preceding paragraph, we feel that this is an example of inter-analyst variation rather than
collection bias. The proportions of almost all other imported types are relatively consistent
among the two collections. A slightly higher proportion of Chupadero Black-on-white is present
in the LCAS collections, but the difference of less than 1.0% is not statistically significant.
Realistically, there are only two major differences in imported wares among the two collections:
the low proportion of Ramos Black (or incised polished blackware) in the LCAS collection and
the absence of Rio Grande Glaze A in the 2015 assemblage. It is difficult to determine if these
variations are due to collection bias, but it does appear that the LCAS crews collected all the Rio
Grande Glazeware sherds while leaving a good number of Ramos Black sherds in the spoil piles.

Figure 12.27. Comparison of proportions of imported wares and types in the LCAS and 2015 ceramic
collections.

Finally, a more focused comparison of ceramic collections from Pit Structure 1 is illustrated in
Figure 12.28. Roswell Corrugated is absent among all the collections. The 2015 collection lacks
Glaze A and Playas Red Incised. In light of the small sample sizes for several of the types the
absence of Playas Red Incised can probably be attributed to random variation. The absence of
Rio Grande Glaze A reflects the site-wide pattern noted above for the 2015 assemblage.
Examining the two bar clusters at the left side that display the proportions of ceramic types by the
upper and lower occupational strata, it is seen that Jornada/Roswell Brown, Three Rivers Red-onterracotta, Playas Red Incised, and Ramos Black are absent from the upper occupational strata. It
is uncertain if this reflects a subtle temporal difference or is due to bioturbation and other random
processes.

The Groundstone Assemblage
Several types of grinding, battering, and abrading tools were recovered from the Merchant site,
the majority of which were from refuse deposits in midden areas and Pit Structure 1.
Based on tabulations of Leslie’s provenience counts, a total of 258 groundstone items were
recovered from the domestic rooms, two pit structures, and four refuse areas. During the 2015
excavations, a higher count of 423 items was collected, nearly 80 percent of which were from
backdirt deposits from Pit Structure 1 that had been screened by LCAS members. The LCAS and
2015 groundstone assemblages are listed Table 12.7.
Leslie’s original classification and tool terms have been retained for the most part, but certain
types have been combined or grouped using the classification and descriptive terms described by
Adams (2002) for groundstone tools.
Grinding and Pulverizing Tools – Manos and Metates
Slab and Basin Metates: Along with manos, metate and metate fragments account for the
majority of groundstone artifacts in both the LCAS and 2015 collections (19.8 and 48.4 percent
of groundstone items, respectively). Thirty complete or mostly complete metates and 21
fragments were recovered by the LCAS crews; 1 complete or mostly complete metate and 204
fragments were recovered in 2015. A ratio of 1.5 whole specimens to fragments is present in the
LCAS collection, while the ratio is 0.005 whole specimens to fragments in the 2015 collection.
The discrepancy represents another case of collection bias and can almost certainly be explained
by the fact that LCAS members discarded small fragments and retained only complete or mostly
complete items. Metates and metate fragments were recovered from all major contexts but were
found in higher proportions in refuse areas.

Basin metates in the LCAS collection were both oval and rectangular in outline; the interior
grinding surfaces were almost exclusively oval-shaped (Figure 12.29). Most of the specimens
were symmetrically shaped by pecking and grinding. The largest examples measured 45 cm in
length with an average of 25 cm, and widths ranged from 13 to 25 cm. One example had been
ground through the base and discarded in a refuse area. Slab metates were similar in shape and
size but had flat rather than indented oval grinding surfaces (Figure 12.30). A partially shaped
blank metate that apparently was not suitable for collection by the LCAS was recovered from the
backdirt ring of Pit Structure 1 in 2015 (Figure 12.31).
Leslie states that all metates from the Merchant collection were manufactured from the local
sandstone outcrops at the base of the escarpment. Inspection of the examples in the figures seems
to support the statement, as most specimens clearly have a grainy texture similar to the local
sandstone.
Manos: Manos and mano fragments account for the highest percentage of groundstone artifacts
in both the LCAS and 2015 collections (50.8 and 15.9 percent of the groundstone items,
respectively). Twenty-eight complete or mostly complete manos and 103 fragments were
recovered by the LCAS crews; 13 complete or mostly complete manos and 54 fragments were
recovered in 2015. A ratio of 0.3 whole specimens to fragments is present in the LCAS
collection, while the ratio is 0.2 whole specimens to fragments in the 2015 collection. The
discrepancy between whole specimens and fragments noted among the metate collections is not
repeated among the manos.

Convex manos in the LCAS collection were the most common form (Figure 12.32). Only two of
the specimens had two grinding surfaces and all were one-handed types used with basin metates.
Flat manos have a single grinding surface. The shapes and dimensions are similar to convex
types, but the intensely worn edges of convex manos are lacking on flat specimens. All were
one-handed types used with slab metates. The shapes of the manos ranged from rectangular to
oval, the final shape partially dependent upon the amount of use. The whole specimens ranged
from 12 to 17 cm in length, 9 to 12 cm in width, and averaged 5 cm in thickness. A similar
variety of convex and flat manos was recovered during the 2015 investigations (Figure 12.33).
As noted for the metates, the majority of mano specimens were manufactured from the local
sandstone outcrops at the base of the escarpment. Mano and mano fragments were recovered
from all major contexts but were found in higher proportions in refuse areas with particularly
high counts noted in the upper and lower occupational strata of Pit Structure 1.
Pestles: Three pestles were recovered by the LCAS crews in refuse areas and from a cluster of
bedrock mortars located to the north of the habitation area. A single pestle was collected during
the 2015 excavations of Pit Structure 1. One of the LCAS specimens had a circular cross-section,
and the other had oval cross-sections that generally match the shapes of bedrock mortars in the
vicinity of the settlement. Raw materials included sandstone, indurated caliche, and dolomite.
Based on the number of bedrock mortars in the area, Leslie suggests that many more pestles were
present at the Merchant site but most had been taken by looters.
Large Percussion and Hafted Percussion Tools
Leslie describes several types of large percussion and digging tools, including 12 choppers, 2
hand picks, 9 digging stones, and 5 mauls. This class of groundstone tool represents 11 percent
of the LCAS groundstone tools, but no such tools were recovered during the 2015 excavations in
the village area.
Choppers and Hand Picks: These are round and oval cobbles of indurated caliche or quartzite
that were roughly flaked on one edge to create chopping and digging edges (Figure 12.34). The
criteria Leslie used to differentiate between the two tool forms are unclear and few photographs
exist to help clarify matters. Leslie notes that two specimens were larger and would have
required the use of two hands and perhaps that is the criterion he used to classify the two hand
picks. The two types are probably similar enough in form and function to be considered a single
tool. The tools vary widely in size, ranging from 22 to 122 cm in length, 7 to 12 cm in width, and
3 to 6 cm in thickness. One tool was notched near the smaller end and may have been hafted.
Digging Tool: From an inspection of the few photographs of items with the identifier “digging
stone,” we conclude that Leslie used this term to describe tabular knives or similar tool forms (see
Figure 12.34). The tools could have been used to excavate hearth pits or room outlines, and they
may also have been used as agave knives. No examples of this tool were recovered during the
2015 excavations in the LCAS village area, but one specimen was recovered from Feature 64, a
small Protohistoric hearth located 135 m south of the village.
Maul: Five large stone mauls were recovered during the LCAS excavations of refuse areas and
Pit Structure 1. This tool form is a large, heavy, elongated cobble of dolomite or quartzite with
both ends battered, pitted, and abraded from heavy use (Figure 12.35). All five specimens had
concave centers and two had evidence of pecking to form a groove for hafting. Measurements
ranged from 20 to 28 cm in length and 8 to 12 cm in width. Leslie notes that heavy mauls were
common at eastern Jornada settlements that had pit structures dug into bedrock caliche. This
impression is supported by the fact that two of the mauls at the Merchant site were recovered
from Pit Structure 1. Such tools would have been necessary to dig through the extremely hard
layer of caliche conglomerate.

specimen is likely the one that measured 20 cm length.

Small Percussion Tools
Hammerstone: Hammerstones were one of the more common groundstone tools, a fact that is not
surprising considering the huge quantities of chipped stone debitage and projectile points at the
Merchant site. Fifty-four tools were collected by the LCAS crews and 11 were recovered in
2015. They were present in all contexts with the somewhat surprising exception of Pit
Structure 2. Most of the items in both collections are manufactured from hard quartzite nodules
obtained from the local conglomerate or from Ogallala formation outcrops a few miles to the east
of the site (Figure 12.36). Battered and fractured surfaces were present on one or two facets. The
343

The Merchant Site

damage on some specimens is quite extensive, with large whitish areas resulting from heavy and
repeated impacts that collapsed the quartz grains on the tool surface. Based on the examples in
photographs, a few specimens appear to have a ground surface and may have been used as small
handstones for working hides or grinding small substances.
Abrading, Smoothing, and Polishing Tools
Two types of abrading, smoothing, or polishing tools were recovered during the LCAS and 2015
excavations: grooved abraders and polishing stones.
Grooved Abraders: Leslie lists three grooved abraders from domestic rooms and refuse deposits.
They are modified mano fragments with a shallow groove in the center (Figure 12.37). One
broken item has a second shallow groove. Two were made of quartzite and one of sandstone.
The grooved abraders from the Merchant site differ from forms usually described as shaft
abraders and shaft smoothers. The grooves of the Merchant examples are much smaller and
much shallower than the grooves of typical shaft abrading tools (Adams 2002).
Polishing stones: Twenty-three polishing stones were collected from refuse and backdirt deposits
during the 2015 excavations, 20 of which were from Pit Structure 1. Leslie’s tabulations of
groundstone artifacts do not include this tool type. However, slide photograph E4_87 displays a
number of small, smoothed quartzite nodules that would be classified as polishing stones under
the present classification (Figure 12.38). If Leslie subsumed these items with hammerstones, that
would partially explain the much higher proportion of hammerstone in the LCAS assemblage
compared to the 2015 assemblage.
Indeterminate Groundstone Fragments
A total of 113 items with ground or battered surfaces that could not be classified to a specific tool
form was recovered during the 2015 excavations. Leslie lists only two indeterminate specimens.
The discrepancy is related to the different proportions of metate fragments discussed above and
resulted from LCAS members discarding small fragments.
Groundstone Provenience and Comparative Data
Tabulations of groundstone tool types by provenience and stratigraphic zone for the LCAS
excavations are provided in Table 12.8. The groundstone counts for the 2015 investigations are
listed in Table 12.9. As with projectile points and ceramics, the LCAS and 2015 assemblages are
compared in order to identify potential sources of bias. The proportions of tool types identified in
the two collections are plotted in Figure 12.39.
As with previous analyses, several discrepancies are evident in the graph. Large tool forms such
as mauls and choppers are absent in the 2015 collection, while significantly greater proportions of
indeterminate fragments are present in the 2015 assemblage. The LCAS collection has a
significantly higher proportion of hammerstones. These discrepancies are another example of
collection bias resulting from the selective collection of large and whole tools by the LCAS crew
members while discarding large numbers of small and broken items. The apparent absence of
polishing stones in the LCAS collections is probably due to Leslie’s inclusion of polishing stones
with hammerstones (as indicated by his photo log description for Slide E4_87). The combination
of polishing stones with hammerstones would also explain to some extent the significant
differences in hammerstone proportions between the two collections.

Figure 12.39. Bar chart illustrating proportions of groundstone tool types recovered during the LCAS and
2015 excavations.

The Flaked Stone Assemblage
Several types of grinding, battering, and abrading tools were recovered the Merchant site, the
majority of which were from refuse deposits in midden areas and Pit Structure 1.
Based on tabulations of Leslie’s provenience counts, a total of 1,893 flaked stone tools were
collected during excavations in the village area (Table 12.10), of which 1,608 (85%) were
projectile points. A much higher count of 4,686 artifacts was recovered during the 2015
excavations, but 4,489 of those items consist of debitage, cores, and flake tools, many of which
were collected from backirt deposits where they had been discarded by the LCAS excavators.
Subtracting these items from the total leaves a collection of 113 formal tools, a much smaller total
than Leslie’s count.
Leslie’s collection of flaked stone tools consists almost entirely of formal unifacial and bifacial
tools, and it is also apparent that the majority of the specimens are complete. In contrast, the
collection of bifacial tools from the 2015 fieldwork consists of many fragments and partial tools,
again reflecting the pervasive collection bias present in the backdirt deposits left by the LCAS
excavators and looters.
Leslie’s original classification and tool terms have been retained in the data tables, but certain
types have been combined or grouped using the classification and descriptive terms described by
Andrefsky (2005) and others. The 2015 classification also differiented between unimarginal and
unifacial tools and bimarginal and bifacial tools. Unimarginal and bimarginal tools include
similar shapes and edge forms as unifaces and bifaces, but were flaked across only one-third or
less of the dorsal and/or ventral sides. In contrast, unifacial and bifacial tools were flaked across

more than one-third of one or both sides. In the case of the Merchant site collections, the
difference is rather inconsequential. A close inspection of the photographs of unifacial end
scrapers in Leslie’s archive finds that a few of the tools could be classified as unimarginal
scrapers. In the case of bimarginal tools, only a single specimen was noted among the 4,704
flaked stone artifacts in the 2015 assemblage.
Leslie’s manuscript displays several grainy black-and-white photographs and a single line
drawing of formal bifacial tools, but a search of the photographic archives was unable to locate
any of the original photographs. The manuscript versions have been cleaned and enhanced for
inclusion in the following discussion, but the quality and clarity of the images remains poor.

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Chipped Stone Raw Materials
A wide variety of raw material types and textures was identified in the assemblage (

Table 12.11). A combined chert/chalcedony category accounts for nearly 77 percent of the
chipped stone items. This category was applied to the thousands of pieces of flake debitage that
were too small to be consistently identified as chert or chalcedony on the basis of macroscopic
observations of texture, color, and inclusions. Based on the approximate 5:1 ratio of chert to
chalcedony identified in larger artifacts, it is likely that chert accounts for around 80 percent of
the chert/chalcedony material group. As would be expected for a chipped stone assemblage
heavily oriented towards bifacial and unifacial tools, fine-grained materials such as chert,
chalcedony, and obsidian account for almost 89 percent of the assemblage. Many of the materials
documented in the regional study of stone material sources (Vierra et al. 2013) are present in the
Merchant site assemblage, with the exception of opalized caliche.
Medium-grained materials, including limestone, basalt, siltstone, and tuff, account for less than 5
percent of the artifacts, while medium- to coarse-grained material (quartzite, sandstone, rhyolite)
accounts for 6 percent. A few quartz flakes were also identified. Most of the medium- and
coarse-grained materials were identified among hammerstones and hammerstone fragments, core
tools, large bifaces, and other large, expedient tool types.
A few patterns were noted. All of the obsidian artifacts were found in Pit Structure 1. Tuff,
shale, sandstone, and rhyolite were more common among the possible agricultural features and
the peripheral hearth features at the southern edge of LA 43414. Informal flakes, tools, and large
expedient tools were also more common in these features, and flake debitage was less common.
The patterns of tool use and corresponding material types in and around the agricultural features
and peripheral hearths reflect different functional uses as opposed to the LCAS village area.

The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Figure 12.40 provides a bar chart of the adjusted standardized residuals of raw materials by the
major tool and debitage artifact classes. The adjusted standardized residuals are the differences
between observed and expected cell counts in a contigency table (crosstabulation) standardized to
z (standard deviation) scores. Values greater than 1.97 or less than -1.97 are statistically
significant. Chalcedony and chert were the preferred materials for projectile points, while chert
was preferred for the other formal tool types as well as utilized flakes. The “other” category,
consiting of medium- and coarse-grained materials, was rarely utilized for bifacial tools and
utilized flakes and occurs mostly among hammestones.

Unifacial Tools
Leslie subdivided the class of unifacial tools into several types based on size and the location of
the worked edge. The types include small end scraper (152), side scraper (39), side/end scraper
(20), medium end scraper (1), and graver (1). Descriptions of medium end scraper and graver
were not included in his manuscript, perhaps because each type is represented by a single
specimen.
Side scrapers and side/end scrapers are small unifacial tools with oval, triangular, and rectangular
shapes (Figure 12.41). One or two sides were modified to produce a straight or slightly convex
working edge with a steep edge angle. The tools were manufactured from thick flake blanks, as
indicated by the presence of striking platforms and percussion bulbs on many specimens. Sizes
average between 1.5 and 2.5 mm, with a few specimens measuring 3 cm in length. Local chert

The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

gravels and white quartzite were preferred for the tools although a small number were
manufactured of a different dark-colored siliceous material that Leslie describes as a siliceous
quartzite (Figure 12.42). Leslie also notes that larger tools were manufactured from non-local
cherts, including possible Edwards Plateau varieties. The group of tools identified as side scrapers
appears to have been a slightly larger (average 7 cm, thickness 2 cm) unifacial tool with a single,
steep-angled working edge flaked along one side of the long axis of the tool.
Unifacial tools were the most common type of formal tool at the Merchant site. At least one, and
usually several, unifacial tools were recovered from every room, pit structure, and refuse deposit,
with the notable exception of Zone E, the deposit of animal bone in Pit Structure 1.

Figure 12.42. Additional examples of unifacial tools of different raw materials.

Bifacial Tools
As with the unifacial tools, Leslie assigned bifaces to several subtypes based on differences in
shape. For clarify of discussion, these have been combined into three general types: drills and
perforators, knives, and a special form of beveled bifacial knife common to Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric Plains toolkits. Projectile points, another form of bifacial tool, were reviewed
earlier in the chapter.
Drills and Perforators: Seventeen bifacial drills and perforating tools were recovered (Figure
12.43). Despite the obvious domestic function of such tools, most specimens were recovered
from refuse areas rather than domestic rooms or pit structures. Most were fragmentary with
either the base or drill segment missing. Two of the drills were reworked projectile points. The
length of whole specimens ranged from 4.0 to 7.5 cm. Leslie notes that small specimens were
manufactured of local cherts; the larger examples were made from non-local varieties.
357

The Merchant Site

Figure 12.43. Examples of drills and perforators. Item at the lower left is a reworked projectile point.

Bifacial Blades or Knives: Leslie subdivided this group into three types based on shape: leafshaped, oval, and triangular. Examples of various bifacial tool forms are illustrated in Figure
12.444 and Figure 12.45 along with a line drawing of bifaces and the four-beveled knife
illustrated in Figure 12.46. Several miscellaneous biface forms were recovered that Leslie
describes as thick blanks or crude bifacial tools.
Bifaces were rarely recovered from domestic rooms, with only two items found in Room 10.
Most were recovered from refuse deposits, although an unusually high number of such tools were
recovered from Zone F, the upper floor fill of Pit Structure 1. The leaf-shaped type has pointed
and rounded working edges and measures from 6 to 10 cm in length and averages 2 cm in
thickness. Oval bifaces have working edges around the entire perimeter. Triangular bifaces are
similar to oval forms except for having a single straight edge.
As observed among other tool types, Leslie notes that smaller tools were made from local cherts
while larger specimens were manufactured from non-local raw materials such as Edwards Plateau
chert. The exception is the subtype of triangular forms, all of which appeared to be made of
Edwards Plateau chert or other non-local cherts.

Harahey knife
Figure 12.46. Leslie’s line drawing of bifacial tools. Inset is a photograph of the Harahey knife illustrated at
the lower left.

Harahey Knife (Four-bladed beveled knife): Ten examples of this unique tool form were
recovered: one from Room 4, three from refuse areas, two from Pit Structure 2, and four from
Zone F (upper floor) of Pit Structure 1. A line drawing of a whole specimen from the Merchant
site is included at the lower left of Figure 12.46. Leslie states that only four specimens were
complete, the remainder having evidence of intense use to the point of having been exhausted and
discarded in refuse areas. Average length of the whole specimens was 8.0 cm. All ten tools were
made from a light to dark gray chert that was not of local origin.
Leslie notes that this type of knife is very rare in southeastern New Mexico, although Collins
(1968) reports five such tools from the Salt Cedar site near Andrews Lake. Beyond southeastern
New Mexico, Harahey knives are a distinctive tool found throughout the Plains from central
Texas to North Dakota (Perino 1985; Turner and Hester 1999:274-276). They are a diagnostic
artifact type of the Protohistoric Garza Complex in the northern Texas Panhandle (Boyd 1997;
Boyd et al. 1997). The tools are diamond-shaped with four edges, each having a distinctive
pattern of alternating beveling from continual resharpening. Some researchers (e.g., Brosowske
2005) have proposed that Harahey knives were formed through intensive use of ovate bifaces and
are simply a stage along the trajectory from manufacture to discard. Their presence at the
Merchant and Salt Cedar sites of the Ochoa phase is intriguing and merits further investigation.

The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

Flaked Stone Provenience and Comparative Data
Tabulations of flaked stone artifacts and tool type by provenience and stratigraphic zone for the
LCAS excavations are provided in Table 12.12. The counts for the 2015 assemblage are listed in
Table 12.13.
Variations in content between the LCAS and 2015 assemblages have been discussed throughout
the preceding section. During the 2015 excavations, the flaked stone debitage, flake tools, and
cores were collected from backdirt deposits. It is likely that most of these artifacts were present
in the screens of LCAS members and the looters, but were considered undesirable artifacts and
were discarded back into the spoil piles. The collection of flake debitage also led to the
identification of numerous flake tools, establishing that this informal tool form was a significant
component of the Merchant toolkit.
The formal tool assemblages are compared separately. To facilitate the comparison, the
unimarginal tools have been combined with unifaces and the single bimarginal tool was added to
the group of bifaces. Separating projectile points from the formal tool counts, totals of 213
unifaces and 69 bifaces were recovered by the LCAS crews, representing a ratio of 3.1 unifaces to
bifaces. For the 2015 collection, 23 unifaces and 75 bifaces and formal tools were identified,
representing a uniface-to-biface ratio of 0.3. It is unclear why the LCAS assemblage has a much
higher proportion of unifaces. Perhaps one or more of the LCAS members had a personal
preference for collecting this artifact type, or, perhaps certain members retained many of the
formal and stylized bifacial tools in their personal collections. Leslie notes several times
throughout his manuscript how many artifacts from Merchant were taken from the site by looters
and LCAS members and were not available for analysis or counting. It is reasonable to assume
that the greater the visual appeal and collectability of the artifact, the more likely the item would
have been retained by a crew member or looter. It is also possible that the higher proportion of
bifaces in the 2015 assemblage is inflated by the fact that small fragments of bifacial tools were
discarded by the LCAS crew and looters.

The Material Culture of the Merchant Site

These impressions are supported by the nature of the tools recovered during the 2015 excavations
(Figure 12.47). A few well-formed unifacial tools were recovered, but the majority were broken
or less formal unifaces with a single working edge. The collection of bifaces was mostly
fragmetary and represented tools broken during manufacture or use. Few of the 2015 tools
resemble the 1959-1965 collection in terms of completeness and formality of manufacture, and is
is inferred that the 2015 collection consists mostly of unappealing tools that were discarded by
the LCAS excavators.

Artifacts of Shell, Bone, Shaped Stone, and Pigments
A total of 163 miscellaneous items were recovered during the LCAS and 2015 excavations.
Among this total are a wide variety of artifacts crafted from freshwater and marine shell, animal
bone, and stone, as well as several pieces of pigment. All but one of the 163 items was collected
by the LCAS; the 2015 fieldwork recovered a single piece of pigment. These items are critical
for understanding the broader social and ritual lives of the inhabitants of the settlement.
Freshwater Shell
Twenty-seven items of modified freshwater mussel shell were recovered by Leslie and the LCAS
crews. Most of the items were small pendants or beads made from drilled or shaped pieces of
mussel shell valves (Figure 12.48). Forms include simple rectangular or oval pendant shapes and
more complex carved and shaped pieces, including a fragment pendant that appears to have been
an effigy.
Leslie notes that numerous unmodified mussel shell valves and valve fragments were found in
deposits and screens during the LCAS excavations but that most of the finds were discarded and
only 14 specimens were collected. The most commonly cited source for freshwater mussel shell
is the Pecos River valley. Leslie, however, makes an interesting observation that mussel bivalves
may have been collected from freshwater playas in the vicinity.
No freshwater or marine shell artifacts were recovered during the 2015 excavations in refuse
areas and backdirt deposits in the two pit structures. It is likely that all modified pieces were
collected by the LCAS and looters, but that doesn’t explain the absence of unmodified pieces that
were left in the backdirt piles. Leslie notes that mussel shells he observed around playa
shorelines in the area would decompose into small slivers, and perhaps the unmodified shell
fragments did not survive 50 years of exposure in shallow backdirt deposits.
Marine Shell
Ten Olivella shell beads and four shell disk beads were recovered by the LCAS crews. The
Olivella shell had been ground at the ends to expose the hollow inner cavity for stringing. The
Olivella sp. shells at the Merchant site were not identified to species, and it is unknown whether
they represent species procured along the California Pacific coast or Texas Gulf coast, but in
either case, they reflect participation in long-distance exchange networks across the southern
Plains.

and shapes; the right panel shows a color image of the effigy pendant.

Stone Pendants
Five shaped and drilled stone pendants measuring 2 to 3 cm in length were recovered. Shapes
included rectangular, oval, and triangular, and all had been drilled from both sides. The pendants
were made of quartzite (2), sandstone (2), and hematite (1).
Modified Animal Bone
Examples of modified animal bone were reviewed in Chapter Eleven. Modified bones include
artiodactyl antler fragments, bone awls, carved bones, and notched bone fragments.
Five antler tips (billets?) with evidence of use-wear were recovered (see Figure 11.3 for
examples). The rarity of this tool type is surprising given the numbers of projectile points
manufactured by the inhabitants of the Merchant site.
In contrast to the low number of antler billets, a total of 47 bone awls were recovered (Figure
12.49, see also Figure 11.4). The lengths of complete specimens vary from 6 to 16 cm.
Somewhat surprisingly, most of the awls were recovered from refuse deposits outside domestic
rooms and within the two pit structures, as opposed to within domestic rooms.
Forty-eight fragments of notched bone (rasps) were recovered, the largest measuring nine cm in
length with most specimens averaging four to five cm (Figure 12.50). Rib bones were the most
common element used, along with a few long bones. Notches were carved 1.5 to 2 cm apart
along the flat curved side of the rib. The original size of the implements at the Merchant site is
unknown, but Leslie notes that a complete notched bone rasp found with a burial at the Bell Lake
site measured 39 cm in length.
Seven fragments of animal bone with carved lines or designs were recovered. Most measured 2.5
cm in diameter and had one or two shallow grooves carved around the perimeter of the bone near
the distal end that had been ground or worn smooth. Crude geometric designs were carved on
one medial fragment.

Pigments
Two pieces of hematite (red ochre) pigment were recovered from Rooms 5 and 23 by the LCAS.
A single piece of limonite (yellow) pigment was collected from Refuse Area A during the 2015
excavations. The piece from Room 5 is an exceptionally large sample measuring over 8 cm in
length and has several ground and striated surfaces (Figure 12.51).
The presence of these pigments is intriguing because there would have been little or no
connection to painted ceramics. The locally produced Ochoa wares were decorated with textured
surfaces, but there is no account of any painted decorations for this ware. The presence of such
large pieces of pigment is suggestive of ritual use of this material.

Provenience and Comparative Data
Tabulations of miscellaneous artifacts by provenience and stratigraphic zone for the LCAS
excavations are provided in Table 12.14. A single fragment of limonite pigment was collected
from Refuse Area A during the 2015 fieldwork. Given that only a single pigment specimen was
recovered in 2015, the primary conclusion of an inter-assemblage comparison is that the LCAS
crews were very thorough in their collection of shell and bone artifacts. A review of Table 12.14
finds little evidence of patterned distributions among domestic rooms, refuse areas, and pit
structures.

Summary: The Material Culture of the Merchant Site
The intent of the preceding discussions was twofold: to describe the morphological, typological,
and technological variation among the projectile point, ceramic, groundstone, flaked stone, and
miscellaneous artifact assemblages recovered during the 1959-1965 LCAS excavations and 2015
fieldwork, and to compare the two collections to identify collection bias. The latter component of
the discussion is important because the biases observed among counts and proportions of artifact
classes or types in both collections, some of which are rather severe, will, in turn, affect
interpretations regarding the technological, economic, and social domains of the Merchant site
and its inhabitants. This problem is magnified by the fact that the LCAS collections are lost, and
thus the only materials avaiable for future technological or attribute analyses are those recovered
during the 2015 fieldwork.
Several interassemblage biases were identified. There is one overarching source of bias: the
2015 assemblage was recovered from screened backdirt deposits and consists mostly of items that
were ignored, discarded, and in some cases, such as the small number of whole projectile points,
missed by the LCAS crews and looters. Across all material classes, the very low counts of
unassigned or unidentified artifacts in the LCAS tabulations are troubling and indicate that
broken or unappealing artifacts were usually not collected.
Differences among the collections of projectile points and ceramics were mostly minor, and some
may be attributable to random processes rather than collection bias. The 2015 assemblage has a
greater proportion of Type 1-B/C (Fresno) and fewer Type 2-B/C (Washita) points, a difference
that may be partially explained by the fact that the LCAS excavators discarded broken and
unappealing Fresno points, thus inflating their proportional representation in the 2015 collection.
The two ceramic collections are remarkably consistent. A greater proportion of Ochoa Indented
Corrugated smudged bowl sherds was identified in the 2015 assemblage, but that is due to
differences in analytical classification rather than collection bias. The only significant difference
was the absence of Rio Grande Glazeware A in the 2015 assemblage.

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

A more pervasive pattern of collection bias was evident among the groundstone collections.
Large tool forms such as mauls and choppers are absent in the 2015 collection, while significantly
greater proportions of indeterminate fragments are present in the 2015 assemblage. The LCAS
collection also has a significantly higher proportion of hammerstones. These discrepancies are
another example of collection bias resulting from the selective collection of large and whole tools
by the LCAS crew members while discarding large numbers of small and broken items.
The most profound biases were detected among the flaked stone assemblages. Leslie provides
qualitative statements on the amounts of waste flakes in certain deposits. For example, he notes
that “few” flakes were observed in Zone A of Pit Structure 1 while “many” were seen in Zone I.
However, none of the debitage and informal flake tools were collected and only three cores were
retained. In contrast, the 2015 assemblage has 4,309 pieces of debitage, 149 flake tools, and 41
cores. The 2015 collection provides a robust sample of debitage, informal tools, and cores for
technological attribute analysis. On the other side of the tool spectrum, Leslie’s report describes
counts of 69 formal bifacial tools and 213 unifacial tools. A variety of shape, hafting, and
working edge configurations were present among the bifaces, including beveled Harahey knives.
None of these visually striking artifacts were found during the 2015 excavation. It is reasonable
to assume that the greater the visual appeal and collectability of the artifact, the more likely the
item would have been retained by a LCAS crew member or looter. This interpretation is
supported by the fact that very few of the tools recovered during the 2015 fieldwork resemble the
1959-1965 collection in terms of completeness and formality of manufacture, and is is inferred
that the 2015 collection consists mostly of unappealing tools that were discarded by the LCAS
excavators.
Of course, if there is one material class that truly demonstrates the selective collection of artifacts,
it would be animal bone and particularly the unmodified animal bone. The LCAS assemblage
consists of 107 modified items: antler tips, awls, notched bones, and incised bones. The 2015
excavation of a sample of the backdirt mound of Pit Structure 1 and the interior backdirt fills of
Pit Structures 1 and 2 recovered 20,898 bones. The total would have been many times greater if
the entire backdirt mounds surrounding the two structures had been excavated (based on
volumetric densities, it is estimated that another 100,000 to 200,000 bones may be present in the
remaining backdirt mounds around the two structures). It is perhaps fortunate that bone was not
collected by the LCAS or it would have ended up lost with the other collections.
Despite the problems of assemblage bias, the two collections from the Merchant site offer
important insights into the nature of settlement and subsistence, the economic and social
relationships of the inhabitants with those residing in adjacent regions, and the social identity of
the inhabitants themselves. Thanks to Leslie’s dedicated efforts, we have a detailed record of the
material culture and its context. There are several intriguing aspects of the collections. The
ceramics derive from Southwestern traditions, the projectile points reflect the widespread bow
and arrow traditions after A.D. 1200 or 1300 present among both Plains and Pueblo settlements
across southern New Mexico and western Texas, and the flaked tool forms are a signature Plains
tool assemblage of small end scrapers and bifacial knives. The presence of several imported
ceramics from southern New Mexico, northern and central New Mexico, and northern
Chihuahua, the incised sherd from somewhere to the east, Olivella shell beads, and obsidian
indicate participation in regional exchange and communication networks. Finally, the
constellation of artifact types at the Merchant site were also identified at the Salt Cedar site
(Collins 1968). Considered together, this observation establishes that Ochoa phase material
culture was a consistent spatial and temporal phenomenon of southeastern New Mexico during
the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.

The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and
Foresight
Myles R. Miller

The Merchant site is a fourteenth and early fifteenth century pueblo settlement located near
Grama Ridge, a prominent escarpment near the boundary where the basin-and-range region
merges with the southern Plains. The Merchant site is representative of the Ochoa phase, a
poorly understood time period of southeastern New Mexico dating from A.D. 1300 to 1450. The
Ochoa phase, and the El Paso and Late Glencoe phases of the Jornada Mogollon region to the
west, are contemporaneous with the Pueblo IV period of the greater Southwest, the Antelope
Creek phase of the southern Plains, and the Toyah phase of central Texas. As such, Merchant and
other Ochoa phase settlements were part of the widespread patterns of population aggregation,
migrations, changing hunting practices, and accompanying developments in social and ritual
organization that occurred throughout the Southwest, northern Mexico, and southern Plains
during the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.
The preceding twelve chapters have reviewed the history of investigations, features, chronology
and subsistence remains, and artifacts. The 2015 excavations in the two deep pit structures
excavated by the LCAS in 1959 and 1960 were able to clarify some details of the architecture and
remodeling history of the structures, as well as obtaining chronometric dates. The backdirt
deposits in and around those structures, as well as other refuse areas, contained thousands of
animal bones, lithic flakes, and ceramics.
Robert Leslie’s written and photographic archives were carefully examined, and many important
aspects of the stratigraphy, features, and artifact assemblages are presented in this report. The
more recent excavations in the LCAS backdirt deposits determined that the LCAS collections are
strongly affected by collection biases towards specific classes and types of artifacts. However,
most of the material classes and types discarded by the LCAS crews and looters were recovered
during the excavations conducted as part of the present project. The artifact collections recovered
during the 2015 fieldwork provide a useful cross-check and complement to the LCAS collections
that were tragically lost.
At the outset of the project, there was some concern among members of the project team and
several of our southeastern New Mexico colleagues whether much in the way of relevant or
useful information could be extracted from an investigation of remnants of a site that was
excavated by avocational archaeologists 50 years ago while being heavily looted, with only an
unpublished manuscript written by a dedicated but untrained avocational archaeologist to guide
the work. To our pleasant surprise, all these doubts proved unfounded. The past and present—
and perhaps future—research at the Merchant site offers one of the more outstanding and
revelatory datasets from southeastern New Mexico.

379

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

This final chapter will bring these revelations to light. I explore several topics: the status of
Leslie’s excavation data, the nature of the two pit structures and domestic architecture, artifact
densities and settlement intensity, agriculture, regional interaction, the unique nature of Ochoa
wares, and the spatial patterning and possible chronological implications of projectile point
associations. The summary statement draws together these topics to explore new concepts and
interpretations of Late Prehistoric settlement and social processes on the southern Plains.

The Nature of the LCAS Excavations and Robert Leslie’s Archive
The fundamental prerequisite for the analysis and interpretation of the Merchant site is the nature
of the descriptive and photographic archive of Robert Leslie. The history of the investigations and
nature of the LCAS archaeological inventory creates a dilemma in how to describe this body of
work in light of modern sensibilities. It is necessary to find a balance between describing what
transpired at the Merchant site during the late 1950s and early 1960s while also describing the
commendable work of Leslie and the LCAS. In other words, I must offer a candid appraisal of
the LCAS excavations and data so that archaeologists have an understanding of the potential and
the limitations of the Merchant data—the collection biases, incomplete written and photographic
documentation of certain critical features and strata, and heavily disturbed and mixed deposits—
while also maintaining some sense of balance so that I am not overly critical of Leslie and the
LCAS. Their efforts truly merit commendation. A key idea to keep in mind is that Leslie
successfully imposed some order and organization at the Merchant site, and without such efforts
the site would just be another example of a disastrously looted site in southern New Mexico.
Calvin Smith (personal communication 2016) notes that Leslie, Corley, and Runyan did not have
any formal training, but each were members of local and statewide archaeological societies, were
voracious readers of whatever archaeological literature could be obtained, and willingly shared
their discoveries with others. Calvin offered another observation that Leslie and Corley were
World War II veterans and, like many of that generation, had the drive and determination to do
things right, and even recalls a conversation with Leslie during which he stated that he wanted to
perform a standard of archaeological work in distant southeastern New Mexico that would be
accepted by academics and professionals working in adjacent, more popular regions of Texas and
the Southwest.
It is clear from discussions throughout Chapters Five, Six, and Twelve that there are problems
with the material. The photographic archive is spotty; there are few photographs of stratigraphy
in the pit structures; many of the domestic rooms lack any photographs; and photographs of
artifacts often included items from numerous sites, making it difficult or impossible to identify
tools recovered from the Merchant site. The LCAS excavators may have missed some of the
subtle floor features in rooms and pit structures (although that is a common problem among
inexperienced professionals too). The artifact collections described and tabulated by Leslie are
affected by collection biases and the indeterminate numbers of items that were taken from the site
by looters and the faction of LCAS members who chose to keep their goodies. Many of the areas
excavated by the LCAS were mixed deposits consisting of screened fill from adjacent rooms or
refuse areas, some of which may have involved multiple episodes of excavation and screening.
And of course, one of the greatest problems is that the artifact collections retained and cataloged
by Leslie were lost when Leslie’s eyesight began to fail and he was compelled to move from his
long-time home in Hobbs, New Mexico to Oklahoma. In preparation for the move, well-meaning
relatives cleaned out his garage, where most of the Merchant collection was stored in ordinary
cardboard boxes, and disposed of everything in the Hobbs city landfill after his death in 1992.
Nevertheless, anyone who examines the Merchant archives will come away truly impressed with
the accomplishments of Leslie and the LCAS, particularly in the context of the rampant looting
and artifact mining that took place between, and sometimes during, their field sessions. I am
380

Chapter Thirteen

singularly impressed with Bus Leslie’s intuitive and perceptive observations on the stratigraphy
of the site, processes of site formation and spatial organization, and artifact attributes, many of
which are equivalent to modern professionals and academics. Yes, Chapters Five, Six, and
Twelve describe some problems with the fieldwork and documentation, but it is also true that
those and the other chapters of the report establish that the Merchant site offers a wealth of data
and has much to offer for understanding the prehistory of southeastern New Mexico.
We have a natural tendency to view the LCAS work and other avocational work of the midtwentieth century through our contemporary lens of knowledge, methods, and technology, and it
is easy to slip into this mode and become frustrated, dismissive, and critical. It must be kept in
mind that the Merchant site excavations took place over 50 years ago. I can pull several of the
classic volumes of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s on Mogollon and Jornada archaeology from my
bookshelf, thumb through them, and see a lot of professional and academic excavation work that
presents no more detail or clarity than Bus Leslie’s typewritten manuscript. I am particularly
impressed with his documentation of stratigraphy in Pit Structure 1. You don’t see much in the
way of pithouse stratigraphy in those early Mogollon and Jornada volumes, and it is apparent that
the excavators often shoveled out the fill to get to the floor architecture and artifacts. Calvin
Smith recalled that Bus Leslie and the LCAS members hoped to achieve a standard of
archaeological fieldwork that would be acceptable to professional archaeologists. Having spent a
year working on the site and with the archives, it is my verdict that they accomplished that goal,
and with that statement I begin the review of the Merchant site and what it all means.

Leslie’s Documentation of the Stratigraphy of Pit Structure 1
Leslie’s description of the stratigraphy of Pit Structure 1 can perhaps be considered his signature
archaeological achievement at the site. A series of stratigraphic zones associated with, or postdating, two occupational floors were documented (see Chapter Six). The strata include deposits
of natural eolian and water-borne sediments (Zones D and G), dense trash fills (Zones A, B, C),
and fills directly on or above the two floors (Zones F and H-I). The most important stratum is
Zone E, a 30-cm-thick layer of animal bone.
Unfortunately, few photographs of the stratigraphy are available, and the schematic cross-section
is the only illustration. The absence of any photographs of the bone layer is particularly
troublesome. The lack of extensive and detailed documentation can lead to some doubt or
question regarding the certainty of the stratigraphic zones. My impression, having closely
examined all the available photographs, is that the descriptions were fundamentally sound,
although I had some concerns how the uppermost two or three zones were differentiated. The
best view of the interior stratigraphy (see Figure 6.6) clearly shows at least two major strata
several feet in thickness overlying a prepared floor with another stratum of trash fill below the
floor. Moreover, the presence of a sterile, natural deposit among the upper fill layers is
corroborated by Leslie’s descriptions and accompanying photographic documentation (see Figure
6.3 and 6.7) that, while following artifact-rich deposits, the looters had dug below the sterile level
and undermined overlying deposits that subsequently collapsed.
To further explore the stratigraphic sequence the projectile point and ceramic totals for each
stratigraphic zone were tabulated (Figure 13.1). Projectile point and ceramic counts are positively
correlated (r = .790, r2 = .623), although inspection of the residuals finds that there is a
disproportionate number of ceramics in Zone H-I and a disproportionate number of projectile
points in Zone C, an observation of interest for later discussion. No artifacts were tabulated for
the natural deposits in Zones D and G. Despite the mass of animal bone in Zone E, few artifacts
were present, which further testifies to the distinctiveness of that stratum. Additional confirmation
for the presence of the mass bone deposit is provided by the fact that thousands of animal bones

were recovered from the backdirt in the structure, and it is estimated that tens of thousands of
bones remain in the unexcavated backdirt deposits. According to John Speth, Leslie told him that
when LCAS members dug the layer, bone was so dense that they dumped wheelbarrow loads
over the edge of the nearby bluff (as noted in Chapter Five, the location of this dump was found
during the 2015 fieldwork). The final observation is that the highest artifact counts are associated
with stratigraphic zones described as consisting of dense refuse deposits. In addition to the
abovementioned photographic and documentary evidence, the artifact counts clearly support the
stratigraphic sequence. The verdict is that there is no evidence that the stratigraphic sequence
cannot be used to derive and support inferences regarding the nature of the pit structure and
meaning of its fill deposits.

Intensity of Settlement at the Merchant Site
Village sites in southeastern New Mexico have conventionally been interpreted as short-term
settlements occupied by mobile hunter-gatherer/horticulturalists (Hogan 2006). While this is an
accurate appraisal of pithouse settlements across the region, the data from Merchant site suggests
that Ochoa phase was something different. A frequently overlooked but critical quality of the
Merchant site is the remarkable numbers and densities of artifacts and animal bones in feature
fills and refuse deposits.
382

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

Thousands of animal bones were recovered during the 2015 excavations of the LCAS backdirt in
Pit Structures 1 and 2 and Refuse Areas A and B. Nearly 20,500 bones were recovered from the
interior backdirt deposits and small sample of the exterior backdirt mound of Pit Structure 1.
Estimates of the total numbers of animal bones can be extrapolated by taking the volumetric
density calculations of excavated bone specimens and multiplying those values by the estimated
cubic meter volume of a refuse or backdirt deposit. These calculations result in estimates of
5,673 bones in Refuse Area A, 23,149 in Refuse Area B, and an astonishing total of 67,000 bones
in the backdirt mound surrounding Pit Structure 1. These totals do not include the domestic
rooms, Refuse Area C, and hundreds of bones discarded along the escarpment edge. Based on
these totals, a conservative estimate is that 100,000 to 150,000 animal bones were discarded in
refuse areas at the Merchant site.
Similar quantities of flaked stone debitage and tools are present. An exceptional number of 1,608
projectile points was documented and Leslie estimated that over 3,000 were present at the site but
were removed by looters. Leslie documented nearly 300 formal tools from the LCAS excavations
and nearly 150 tools were recovered during the 2015 fieldwork. Reflecting these large numbers
of points and tools, nearly 4,500 pieces of debitage were recovered from the backdirt deposits
excavated in 2015. This total would have been multiplied threefold if 1/8-inch mesh screen had
been utilized throughout the excavation and thousands of small retouch and bifacial
manufacturing flakes were collected.
Over 10,000 ceramic sherds were recovered during the LCAS excavations. An additional 2,140
sherds were collected during the 2015 fieldwork, mostly from deposits that had been screened
and collected by the LCAS and looters. Nearly 700 ground and battered stone tools were
recovered during the LCAS and 2015 excavations. This total includes 454 mano and metate tools
and fragments, counts that are usually associated with agricultural villages across the Southwest.
These artifact counts are not the counts typically encountered at short-term residential
settlements. To illustrate this fact, the artifact densities at the Merchant site are compared against
a sample of 84 refuse middens in the western Jornada (Figure 13.2). The middens include
intensively occupied pithouse settlements of Early and Late Doña Ana phases and pueblos of the
El Paso phase. The five major contexts excavated in 2015 are compared against a summed group
representing Jornada middens using a series of median boxplots.
With few exceptions, the artifact and bone densities of the five Merchant site contexts uniformly
plot within the upper interquartile range of the Jornada midden sample (meaning that
approximately 25 percent of the Jornada sample has higher values and 50 percent have lower
values). The flaked stone densities actually fall within the upper quartile or plot among the
statistical outliers of the Jornada sample, demonstrating that flaked stone artifact densities at the
Merchant site are among the highest in southern New Mexico. The densities of animal bone also
plot among the higher ranges of the Jornada sample, with the notable exception of the exterior
backdirt mound of Pit Structure 1 that represents the highest value of the entire dataset
The plots illustrated in Figure 13.2 are noteworthy as is, but even more extraordinary is the fact
that all the plots substantially underestimate the Merchant values. Two factors must be kept in
mind when considering the boxplots. First, the bone densities are by counts, not weights. The
bone densities in the Jornada sample are based on samples consisting of 90 to 95% rabbit and
small or medium mammal bone, most of which is highly fragmentary. The majority of the
Merchant sample consists of bison, deer, antelope, and other medium and large mammal bone. A
single bison bone fragment can weigh as much as a bag of 200 small fragments of rabbit bone.
Therefore, the density values presented in Figure 13.2 do not give a realistic impression of the
weight or volume of animal bone at the Merchant site. Unfortunately, data on bone weights is
unavailable for the Jornada sample. Hypothetically, if such data were available and we were able
383

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

to compare bone weights, the differences between the Jornada and Merchant weight/density
values would be truly off the chart.
The second factor to keep in mind is that the 2015 data used in these graphs is derived from
artifact counts recovered from previously screened deposits from which hundreds of artifacts
were collected by the LCAS and looters. As shown in Chapter Twelve, the 2015 excavations
recovered samples that were severely affected by such collection biases. Only the flaked stone
graph of Figure 13.2 is an accurate representation because the LCAS did not collect the
unappealing debitage, flake tools, cores, and biface fragments. If we were able to accurately
measure the volume of sediments excavated by the LCAS and use their count to calculate
densities, the ceramic and total artifact plots for the Merchant site would range among the outliers
in the Jornada sample.

Figure 13.2. Comparison of material culture densities at the Merchant site against a sample of 84 refuse
middens associated with Late Prehistoric pithouse and pueblos settlements in the western Jornada region.

Clearly, the Merchant site does not fit, in any dimension or form, the standard model of shortterm settlements with low artifact densities. Densities of artifacts and animal bones at Merchant
are equivalent to those documented among intensively-occupied pithouse villages and pueblo
settlements in the western Jornada. These are important observations for a deeper understanding
of the Merchant site. The Merchant site has roomblocks and refuse deposits that reflect long
settlement durations and intensive occupations by multiple family groups. When considered in
384

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

light of the stratigraphy of Pit Structure 1 and the “biography” of that structure (sensu Kopytoff
1986) in terms of its relationship to the social world of the settlement, we begin to see a broader
picture emerging. This leads to the following discussion of the nature of Pit Structures 1 and 2.

What Were Pit Structures 1 and 2?
In the opening to his classic treatment of Southwestern kivas, Watson Smith (1952:154)
observed: “There are many pitfalls for the unwary Southwesternist, but perhaps the easiest to fall
into and most difficult to climb out of is that of the kiva.” I am pretty sure that the pitfalls are
magnified considerably for anyone attempting to drag the concept of a kiva across the southern
Plains. The differentiation of kivas and protokivas from pit structures was the subject of a long
and somewhat still simmering debate (Blinman 1989; Lekson 1988, 1989; Wilshusen 1986, 1988,
1989), and the range of forms and expressions of kivas are still uncertain in certain regions.
The intent here is not to debate the nature of, or the existence of, kivas per se, but rather to
explore the possibility, or more truthfully the probability, that one and perhaps both of the deep
structures excavated by the LCAS and re-excavated in 2015 were a form of civic-ceremonial
architecture at the Merchant site. Leslie (n.d., 1965a) refers to the two structures as rooms or
pithouses, and those terms have been repeated wherever the Merchant site has been referenced
(e.g., Boyd 1997:352; Gregory 2006:7). However, several individuals familiar with the site, as
well as Calvin Smith who participated in the 1959 and 1960 excavations of the two structures,
expressed their opinion that the two deep structures were something analogous to kivas. In the
present report, the generic term “pit structure” was deliberately used when referring to the
structures, thus avoiding any connotations or preconceptions that might have resulted from the
use of the terms “pithouse,” “civic-ceremonial structure,” or “kiva.” In the following discussion
the case for interpreting Pit Structure 1 as a civic-ceremonial structure is presented.
The term civic-ceremonial structure is used here as a generic descriptive term for several forms of
specialized civic architecture that was constructed and used for various social and ritual practices.
Kivas, communal rooms, communal pithouses, socio-religious rooms, shrine rooms, and even
rock-lined dance circles can be considered variants of civic-ceremonial structures. The term is
preferred for the two Merchant site structures because it avoids the specific architectural
attributes and social/ritual functions associated with use of the term kiva in Southwestern pueblo
settlements. Pit Structures 1 and 2 at the Merchant site may very well have been formal
Southwestern kivas, but until another example of such a structure is documented through
controlled excavations it is perhaps best to use a less value-laden term.
Putting aside the terminological issues, there are several lines of evidence that individually and
collectively indicate that Pit Structure 1 had a special function apart from that of domestic rooms.
The most visible and striking aspect is the construction process that involved digging through
almost two feet (60 cm) of caliche conglomerate and indurated calcrete, a difficult feat to
accomplish even using modern tools. The presence of large stone mauls with heavily battered
edges is a testament to the work involved 3 to excavate the pit for the structure. A significant
labor investment—far beyond that required to build a small domestic room—was required to dig
through the caliche, dig another meter or more through clays and loams, prepare a floor, and
construct the superstructure. It is unlikely that a single family or extended family would have
3

Leslie makes an interesting observation regarding the stone mauls at Merchant. He notes that prior to the
availability of pneumatic tools, the historic ranchers and settlers of SE NM dug water wells much in the
same manner as the prehistoric inhabitants of the Merchant site dug the pit structures: using dense and
heavy tools to break up and break through the caliche caprock.

385

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

expended the effort, and it is assumed that construction of the structures was organized at the
supra-household level and involved the inhabitants of several rooms.
The depth of the two structures is significantly deeper than any of the domestic rooms. The lower
floor surface of Pit Structure 1 was at least 1.7 m below the surface. The single floor of Pit
Structure 2 was approximately 1.0 meter below the ground surface, although the presence of
midden deposits surrounding the structure makes it difficult to estimate the position of the
original ground surface. In contrast, Room 8, the deepest of the excavated rooms, was only
50 cm to the floor and most of the rooms averaged 30 cm in depth.
The results of macrobotanical and pollen analysis provide additional insights. Maize was
identified in 10 of the 11 flotation samples from floor features and fill of Pit Structure 1, yielding
a remarkable sample ubiquity value of 91 percent. The macrobotanical results are corroborated
by the pollen analysis, with three out of three samples having significant counts of maize pollen.
Maize pollen is notoriously difficult to recover from sites in southern New Mexico and is often
found in ritual contexts (e.g., Miller and Graves 2009). Perhaps more significant is the
identification of pollen from two unusual plant species. Along with maize, honeysuckle and
cattail pollen were found in a soil sample brushed from a mano fragment on the lower floor.
Cattail (Typha latifolia) pollen has been recovered from several plant baking pits in the
Sacramento Mountains, and Miller et al. (2011) provide a review of ritual uses of this plant. The
Mescalero Apache applied cattail pollen in a cross-shaped design to selected mescal (agave)
crowns before placing them in baking pits (Castetter et al. 1938). Cattail pollen is documented as
both a ritual and food item among several southwestern groups (Moerman 1998; Rea 1997).
Cattail pollen and occasionally pine pollen are second only to maize pollen in the frequency of
mention in ethnographic and ethnobotanical accounts. Moreover, the use of cattail pollen likely
predates the use of maize pollen in the Southwest by a millennium or more and may have abstract
and metaphorical allusions to the watery underworld that was ultimately derived from
Mesoamerica. For example, Cushing (1896, 1988) and Stevenson (1904) note the presence of
cattail reeds around springs as evidence of supernatural origins and through this they allude to
their cosmological point of origin.
The sample from Pit Structure 1 is the first time honeysuckle pollen has been identified in
southern New Mexico. Ethnographic accounts document use of honeysuckle bark, twigs, and
leaves to concoct strong medicines for a variety of skin conditions and sores (Moerman 1998).
Neither plant species grows in the vicinity of the Merchant site, and the presence of these plants
along with corn pollen suggests that something other than mundane, domestic behavior took place
in association with the lower floor.
It is acknowledged that some attributes, or absence of attributes, argue against a special function
or social role for Pit Structure 1. It is somewhat puzzling that large primary support postholes
were missing in Pit Structure 2 and Floor 1 of Pit Structure 1. This may simply be a matter of the
small size of the structures and that large posts were not required to support a relatively light and
thin roof. Small roof support post holes were found in the upper floor (Floor 2) of Pit Structure 1
and at least one small post hole was discovered in the photograph of Pit Structure 2 (see Figure
6.31).
A more substantial issue is none of the special floor or subfloor features typical of Southwestern
kivas (Wilshusen 1989) were found during the 2015 excavations. Such features were present in
the floor of the outstanding civic-ceremonial structure of the Fox Place (Wiseman 2002) near
Roswell, New Mexico, and their absence among the Merchant site structures is troubling. One
explanation is that the subtle floor grooves, small sipapu pits, and other such features were
destroyed by looters or overlooked by the LCAS excavators. Indeed, few floor features of any
386

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

type, including primary roof support postholes and storage or dedicatory pits, were found by the
LCAS crews.
On the other hand, keeping in mind that the Merchant structures are considered a variant of civicceremonial structures as opposed to truly formal Southwestern kivas, it is perhaps unwarranted to
apply the excessively stringent criteria used to classify Southwestern kivas to less formal civicceremonial structures found in peripheral regions such as southeastern New Mexico.. It should be
noted that special floor features are usually absent in the communal rooms (civic-ceremonial
structures) of pueblos in the western Jornada (Lowry 2005; Miller and Graves 2009; O’Laughlin
2001).
The most direct and conclusive evidence of a special function of Pit Structure 1 is the 30-cm layer
of animal bone of Zone E. John Speth (personal communication, 2016) recalls a conversation
with Bus Leslie regarding the nature of the deposit and bone contained within. Leslie noted that
the bones appeared to have been intentionally placed in the deposit one piece over another and
not tossed in haphazardly as typically found among the refuse deposits at the site. Moreover,
Loven and Speth’s analysis of the faunal remains from the 2015 excavations found that 12 of 13
dog bones were recovered from the backdirt of Pit Structure 1 and it is possible that some or all of
the specimens were once part of Zone E. Speth (2004b; see also Bigelow and Speth 2004)
suggests that dogs were a valued food source during communal feasts and ceremonies at
Henderson Pueblo, and they could have served a similar function at Merchant.
The mass bone deposit in Zone E was a form of ritual deposit associated with a feasting event or
the ritual closure of public architecture, and it is possible that the two events were essentially one
and the same. Several studies of the past decade have illuminated the ritual closure or
termination of public architecture or spaces in the Southwest (Adams 2016; Creel and Anyon
2003), including the western Jornada and the Roswell oasis (Miller and Graves 2009; Moore
1946; Speth 2004c).
Pit Structure 2 is more difficult to interpret. A similar labor investment to that of Pit Structure 1
would have been required to excavate and build the structure. Otherwise, the shape of the
structure is highly irregular, the fills and walls were affected by intensive looting, and the LCAS
excavation was much less detailed than for Pit Structure 1. No bone layer is mentioned by Leslie,
and the absence of such a deposit is corroborated by the lower numbers of animal bone recovered
during the 2015 excavations. No unusual artifacts, plant species, or anything else of note was
identified among the material culture from the structure. The only unusual aspect of the structure
is the deep hole or fissure in the southwest corner. Whether or not that feature was of some
significance is unknown.

Domestic Architecture
The domestic architecture of the Merchant site is difficult to fully characterize because many of
the attributes were not fully documented and some rooms were disturbed. The primary
architectural attribute of the domestic rooms are the foundation walls constructed of caliche slabs
and cobbles. However, even this distinguishing attribute is difficult to characterize because the
nature of the foundation walls displayed in some of Leslie’s planview drawings are difficult to
reconcile with the photographic record. With the exception of Room 6, Leslie’s planviews show
well-preserved foundations with formal arrangements of slabs and cobbles, but photographs of
some of the rooms do not appear to show such formal arrangements. For example, the north and
south walls of Room 4 are drawn with highly patterned arrangements of slabs and cobbles in
alternating orientations. There are few photographs of Room 4, and the one or two that do exist
show a single wall with a seemingly disturbed jumble of stones.

387

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

However, the drawings and photographs of some rooms do match. Like Room 4, Leslie’s
drawing of Room 5 shows slabs in alternating orientations and an eastern wall that has a series of
parallel slabs perpendicular to the axis of the wall. The photographs of Room 5 confirm these
construction traits (Figure 13.3; see also Figure 5.11). The north and south walls of Room 9 were
drawn as two parallel lines of caliche slabs. This form of cimiento construction is confirmed by
the photograph of the room (Figure 13.3). It should be noted that Room 4 was one of the first
rooms excavated by Leslie (accompanied by his children), and both the excavation and
documentation of the room may not have followed the standards he imposed during the later
LCAS fieldwork.

Figure 13.3. Two of the better-preserved foundation walls. Left panel, wall of Room 5 showing alternating
orientations of foundation slabs; right panel, Room 9 showing parallel alignment of slabs.

The architecture of the domestic rooms at the Merchant site is of interest because it does not
resemble typical room construction methods in the western or northern Jornada areas or the
Salinas/Chupadera Mesa area. Formal stone slab masonry walls are known in the Jornada
highlands (Kelley 1984) and Salinas pueblos; coursed adobe walls were the primary construction
method for pueblo rooms throughout the lowland Jornada. Aside from a few cases of cimiento
walls in the San Andres Mountains (Browning 1991), the construction form has seldom been
found in the Jornada region.
Interestingly, the method of wall construction at the Merchant site is most similar to slab
foundation constructions associated with several contemporary cultural complexes in the northern
Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma such as Antelope Creek (Brooks 2004; Duffield 1964;
Lintz 1986). Walls of domestic structures at Buried City (Hughes 1991) show similar patterns of
slabs placed in alternating orientations (Figure 13.4). It is noted that the overall dimensions,
interior floor features, presence of conjoined small rooms or storage facilities, and other attributes
of Antelope Creek and other Plains domestic rooms set them apart from the less formal and
complex rooms at the Merchant site. Yet the similarities in wall construction are still of interest.
The Antelope Creek sites have similar Plains tool kits with bifacial and beveled knives and
settlements of the period exhibit a wide range of social and economic contexts (Brosowske 2005).

County, Texas, with foundation wall constructed of slabs and cobbles with alternating orientations (from
Hughes 2002).

Agriculture and Agricultural Features
If dragging kivas across the plains is fraught with pitfalls and dangers, then dragging
Southwestern grid gardens across the plains is even more so. It is acknowledged that the subject
of agricultural features at LA 43414 will be the most controversial topic of this report and the
2015 investigations. Indeed, I conducted an informal survey of the confidence level of project
participants and specialists that the agricultural features are valid and have been correctly
interpreted. The confidence levels ranged from highs of around 70 percent to a low of 30 percent,
so, depending upon one’s personal bias and/or optimism, we have a two-in-three chance of being
right or a two-in-three chance of being wrong.
Admittedly, the nature of the caliche cobble scatters and features across the northwestern part of
LA 43414 remains unsettled. The investigation of the linear stone alignments suggests that they
are probably the result of human agency, presumably for agricultural purposes, but the combined
archaeological, geomorphological, and palynological data are ambiguous. The excavation
exposures and pollen sampling were too limited; excavation, geomorphological analysis, and
pollen sampling of much broader exposures will be required to settle the issue.
The analysis of subsistence samples offers corroborative evidence through the identification of
very high sample ubiquity values for maize macrobotanical specimens and maize pollen. As
proven by the pollen and macrobotanical record of Pit Structure 1, there is little doubt that the
occupants of the Merchant site were agriculturalists in addition to big game hunters, and thus
there is also little doubt that maize fields once existed somewhere in the vicinity of the LCAS
village. The proportion of maize in the subsistence base of the Merchant site also disproves the
conventional interpretation of Ochoa phase sites as non-agricultural.
389

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

The Merchant Site and the Late Prehistoric Southwest and Plains
The fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries of the prehistoric Southwest and Plains were a period
of movement— movement of people, movement of goods and valuables, and movement of ideas
and ideologies. Large-scale population movements of people from the northern to the southern
Southwest have been identified in the archaeological record of southern Arizona, northern New
Mexico, and central New Mexico (Clark 2001; Clark and Laumbach 2011; Lekson et al. 2002;
Lyons 2003). New technologies and archaeological complexes are recognized across the
southern Plains and central Texas (Boyd 1997; Kelley 1947; Johnson 1994; Kenmotsu and Boyd
2012; Lintz 1986). At a more local frame of reference, Jornada groups moved out of the
Sacramento highlands to the Roswell oasis (Kelley 1984; Speth 2004b, 2008). Food, hides,
ceramics, and other materials were exchanged across broad areas (Creel 1991; Creel et al. 2002;
Rocek and Rautman 2007; Speth 2008; Spielmann 1983, 1991). These patterns of movement and
interaction are reflected in the archaeological record through the presence of food remains, valued
goods, ceramics, and even iconographic symbols.
The inhabitants of the Merchant site were part of this movement of people, materials, and ideas.
While the Merchant site and other Ochoa phase settlements could reflect migration of a
Southwest group or Plains group into southeastern New Mexico, we have no data that can
unambiguously resolve that question. While the “movement of people” question remains
unanswered, it is certain the Merchant site inhabitants did participate in the widespread
movement of goods. Ceramics from production areas in northern Chihuahua, southcentral New
Mexico, central New Mexico, and the Roswell oasis were traded to the Merchant site inhabitants.
Gregory (2006:107) identified lithic materials from the Sacramento and Pedernal mountains of
central and northern New Mexico, the northern Texas Panhandle, and Edwards Plateau of central
Texas. The presence of Olivella shell from the Pacific Coast or Gulf Coast reflects the transport
and exchange of this social-valued good across the western United States and northern Mexico
(Bradley 1999, 2000).
Seven obsidian artifacts from the 2015 excavations were submitted for XRF analysis (Appendix
D). Three are identified as Cerro Toledo (Obsidian Ridge), two as coming from the Valles (Cerro
del Medio) source, one was too small for measurement, and one was identified as a vitrophyre.
The proportion of Valles obsidian (33.3 percent) in the Merchant sample is slightly higher than
the 23.9 percent obsidian identified in the sample of 140 obsidian source identifications from
southeast New Mexico (data on file, Carlsbad Field Office), but we should not place much
emphasis on this difference given the small sample number of source-identified items from
Merchant (n=6).
Very few items from the Merchant collections carry any form of iconographic expression that
could be used to link the inhabitants to fourteenth century ideological movements of the western
Jornada, the greater Southwest, or other regions. One item, a freshwater shell pendant, is of
interest4. If the item is oriented with the prongs facing to the side it appears to have a semblance
of a crudely-executed horned serpent (Figure 13.5), though I must confess that this perception
may be more wishful thinking from my Jornada iconographic bias than reality. If the
identification as a horned serpent is correct, a fascinating and critical connection to Southwestern
ideology would be established, as well as a crucial piece of the puzzle regarding the origin of the
Merchant site inhabitants.

It has not been possible to determine the provenience of the artifact. The item has an apparent specimen
number (E4-45), but the LCAS specimen log sheet was lost with the other materials from Leslie’s archives.

There are other means of social signaling and expressing identity, one of which is through the
plastic medium of ceramics. The nature of the Ochoa ceramic tradition is reviewed in the
following section.

The Unique Nature and Origin of Ochoa Ware
Ochoa ware, including Indented Corrugated, Polished, Corrugated, and smudged varieties, is the
signature and diagnostic material associated with the Merchant site, the Salt Cedar site (Collins
1968), and other Ochoa phase settlements on the Mescalero Plain. Technologically, Ochoa ware
is a low-fired, coarse-tempered plainware and thus differs little from Alma Plainware, El Paso
Brownware, Jornada Brownware, Convento wares, and other plainware and textured ceramic
traditions across southern Southwest. Its distinctive feature lies with the mode and style of the
textured designs on vessel exteriors. The indented corrugated surface is a visually and texturally
prominent type of decoration that is quite distinctive among textured wares in the southern
Southwest (Figure 13.6). While Ochoa wares can be included among, and likely derived from,
the long tradition of prehistoric textured Southwestern ceramics, it nevertheless is both a
technologically and stylistically unique expression of that tradition.
Moreover, Ochoa wares are geochemically and compositionally unique. Several compositional
analyses have been conducted on ceramics from the southeastern Southwest and southern Plains.
Boyd and others (2002) describe the NAA and petrographic analysis of plain and textured wares
from Protohistoric occupations in Texas Panhandle-Plains, and Neff and Glascock (1999) report
the results of NAA analysis of brownwares from additional Late Prehistoric sites submitted by
Rex Harris of the University of Texas at San Antonio. Under a Permian Basin PA research grant,
Hill (2014) conducted petrographic analysis on ceramics from several sites in southeastern New
Mexico.

A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

Figure 13.6. Ochoa Indented Corrugated sherds from Speth’s 1984 investigations at the Merchant site (from
Alvarado 2009).

The most extensive analysis was completed by Luis Alvarado of Texas State University.
Alvarado (2008, 2009) submitted 94 sherds of Ochoa Indented Corrugated, Corona Corrugated,
Jornada/Roswell Brown, McKenzie Brown, and Middle Pecos Micaceous Brown from several
sites in Lea, Chaves, and De Baca counties of far southeastern New Mexico and adjacent counties
of the southern Texas Panhandle. The largest single sample consisted of 28 sherds of Ochoa
Indented Corrugated from the Merchant site collected during John Speth’s 1984 brief sampling of
backdirt at the site. The samples were analyzed at the Missouri University Research Reactor, and
the results were reported by Ferguson and Glascock (2007) and reviewed in Alvarado’s 2008
M.A. thesis. Five compositional groups were defined, of which Group 1 consisted entirely of
Ochoa Indented Corrugated sherds from Merchant (Figure 13.7). Alvarado’s study established
that Ochoa wares and other common textured and plainware ceramics from southeastern New
Mexico and the southern Panhandle were produced locally and were not imported from other
regions.
Alvarado’s significant conclusions were confirmed during a reanalysis of the Merchant data that
was part of a larger classification study of plain and textured ceramics of the southeastern
Southwest (Miller and Ferguson 2014). A total of 2,151 sherd samples of plain, textured, and
redware ceramics from the Mimbres, Casas Grandes, Jornada (west and north), La Junta,
Panhandle-Plains, and southeast New Mexico had been submitted for NAA over the past twenty
years. Given the disparities among the dozens of classifications of NAA data conducted over the
years, a single, systematic classification and provenance assignment was urgently needed. The
entire dataset was analyzed using the standard quantitative protocols based on base-10
logarithmic transformed element concentration data, reduction of the dimensionality and
392

complexity of datasets using principal components analysis, and calculation of probabilities of
group membership using Mahalanobis distance measures (Bishop and Neff 1989; Neff 2002).

Ellipses represent a 90% confidence level for membership in the group.

A subset of the analysis results are presented here with the intent of demonstrating the
compositional distinctiveness of Ochoa wares from the Merchant site. Miller and Ferguson
defined seven consistent and stable geochemical compositional groups among the NAA samples
submitted from southeastern New Mexico, the Middle Pecos, and Panhandle-Plains (Table 13.1).
The qualifying phrase “consistent and stable” indicates that the suite of discriminating elements
of a compositional group remained consistent throughout multiple iterations and that the
probabilities of group membership for specimens assigned to the group also remained stable
through multiple analyses. Additional compositional groups may exist among numerous
unassigned sherds, some of which may form new compositional groups with the addition of new
samples in the future, but the groups listed in Table 13.1 represent the current suite of
quantitatively robust groups. The group numbers (91 to 99) are the original groups from the
classification study. Geographic provenance names have been assigned to these groups.

Ochoa Indented Corrugated production group centered at the Merchant
site.

Two groups are defined for southeast New Mexico, including the collection of Ochoa wares (SE
NM 1) from the Merchant site included in Alvarado’s study. Group SE NM 2 includes several
textured types from Henderson pueblo and other sites in the region. The three Middle Pecos
groups include Corona Corrugated from Henderson pueblo and other sites and the two
Panhandle-Plains sites consist of plain brownwares from sites in the Texas Panhandle that were
submitted by Rex Harris in 1999.
Figure 13.8 displays the plot of SE NM Groups 1 and 2 and three Middle Pecos groups against
the major El Paso and Jornada Brownware geographic groups. The El Paso or Jornada
Brownware compositional groups from the Tularosa-Hueco Basin, Sacramento Mountains and
Otero Mesa, and Guadalupe Mountains have been combined for clarity of presentation. The
Ochoa wares from the Merchant site and SE NM Group 2 clearly separate from the El Paso and
Jornada Brownwares. The two compositional groups of southeast New Mexico can be classified
and identified on the basis of a single element, sodium (Na). In fact, a comparison of the
Merchant Ochoa Indented Corrugated samples finds that the collection has the lowest sodium
element concentrations of the entire Southwest dataset of 2,151 sherds.
The chemical composition of the sherds would support Leslie’s type description of Ochoa wares
as tempered with crushed caliche. Sodium concentrations in prehistoric and historic
Southwestern ceramics usually derive from the use of igneous rock rich in plagioclase (sodic)
feldspars as tempering material or the use of clays consisting of decomposed feldspar from such
igneous sources. Moreover, Ferguson and Glascock (2007) noted high calcium concentrations in
the samples from southeast New Mexico that required the application of a standard correction
factor. The exceptionally low sodium concentrations are most likely related to the use of caliche
rather than igneous rock as temper.
At any rate, it is evident that Ochoa wares were among the most chemically distinctive ceramics
produced in southern New Mexico and surrounding regions of west Texas. To further explore the
compositional variation at a more local level, a principal components analysis was conducted on
the seven most powerful discriminatory elements listed in Table 13.1: Na, Cr, Cs, Eu, Dy, Sr,
and Sc. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 13.2, where it is seen that three
principal components account for 73 percent of the variation in the dataset. Principal component
1 has high positive loadings on chromium, europium, strontium, and scandium; principal
component 2 loads primarily on the sodium concentrations that separate the two southeast New
Mexico groups from others.

Figure 13.9 displays southeast New Mexico, Middle Pecos, and Panhandle-Plains groups plotted
on principal components 1 and 2. Again, the two southeast groups are clearly partitioned from
other groups in southern New Mexico and the Panhandle. Southeast NM 2 is somewhat diffuse
compared to the tightly clustered grouping of Ochoa sherds from the Merchant site. This would
395

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

be expected given the group consists of small sherd samples from numerous sites and likely
represents more than one production locale. Of final interest is that five sherds from sites in the
Hueco Bolson near El Paso, Texas, were assigned to SE New Mexico Group 2. The sherds are
from two Late Prehistoric (El Paso phase) sites, a pueblo and a cluster of adobe surface rooms,
and indicate some level of exchange and interaction between the western Jornada and
southeastern New Mexico during the 1400s.

Figure 13.9. Bivariate plot of principal components 1 and 2 comparing southeast New Mexico, Middle
Pecos, and Panhandle-Plains compositional groups. Note also the plot of 5 sherds from the Hueco Bolson
of the western Jornada that classify with Southeast NM Group

Summarizing the compositional and provenance analyses for Ochoa wares from the Merchant
site, it becomes clear that Ochoa phase ceramics represent a Southwestern textured ceramic
tradition transplanted to the southern Plains. There is little dispute over the fact that textured
ceramics were a prehistoric Southwestern technological and stylistic innovation. Across most
regions of the Southwest (the Jornada being a notable exception), cooking vessels changed from
plain pots to textured and corrugated pots between A.D. 600 and 1000 and then changed back to
plain vessels during the 1400s (Pierce 2005). Ochoa ware was clearly part of the larger
Southwestern tradition, with corrugated surface treatments similar to Tusayan Indented
Corrugated (or specifically Medicine Gray Indented Corrugated) from the Tusayan region of
northern Arizona (Colton 1955) and Reserve Indented Corrugated from the Mogollon region of
New Mexico and Arizona (Rinaldo and Bluhm 1956). Both of these Tusayan and Mogollon
types predate the occupation of the Merchant site and production period of Ochoa Indented
Corrugated, and they also lack the distinctive smoothing or flattening of the indentations typical
of Ochoa ware. This distinctive surface treatment renders Ochoa ware a unique style in and of
itself, and its distinctive chemical attributes, likely reflecting the use of a distinctive temper,
establish that Ochoa Indented Corrugated was an indigenous ceramic ware of the Late Prehistoric
period of southeastern New Mexico.

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

Projectile Points, Stratigraphy, and Occupational History
In several places throughout his manuscript, Robert Leslie refers to the presence of different
occupational periods at the Merchant site. He proposed that three occupation periods took place
at the site, inferring that the two pit structures were occupied first, followed by several of the
domestic rooms such as Rooms 3 and 8 that were superimposed by later constructions, and finally
a third occupation consisting of many of the domestic rooms and refuse areas.
The closure, remodeling and reoccupation, and subsequent second closure of Pit Structure 1, as
well as the deposits of trash found throughout the fills of both pit structures, clearly demonstrate
that the village had a long and complex occupational history. Whether that history took place
over the course of a couple decades or less, or took place over the span of a century and included
punctuated intervals of occupation and abandonment, is difficult to determine with any degree of
confidence. The radiocarbon and ceramic chronologies are of insufficient resolution and
precision to address such issues. Other methods of investigating site formation and site
occupational histories such as ceramic refitting or spatial analysis of subtle distributional patterns
among refuse deposits cannot be undertaken because so many deposits were destroyed or mixed
by looters and the LCAS artifact collections are unavailable for inspection. In fact, few people
who reviewed the history of investigations and archive of information, including myself, were of
the opinion that any information regarding site formation and occupational history could be
extracted and reconstructed.
Yet all may not be lost. As described in the preceding chapter, an intriguing aspect of the
projectile point assemblage is that there is some hint of a seriation among the stratigraphic zones
of Pit Structure 1 and perhaps other contexts. Indeed, one of the more striking spatial patterns is
the absence of apparent “later” projectile point types—Garza, Toyah, and Harrell—from the
lower fill and floor deposits of Pit Structure 1.
With this preliminary observation in mind, and considering Bus Leslie’s comments with a revived
sense of purpose, a detailed study of projectile point distributions was undertaken. Data from 21
contexts listed in Table 12.1 having five or more projectile points were reviewed. The contexts
include Rooms 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 21; Refuse Areas A, B, C, and D; Pit Structure 2; and
Zones A, B, C, E, F, and H-I of Pit Structure 1 (plus a general upper fill context subsuming
Zones A through F).
The relative proportions of six projectile point types documented in each context were tabulated.
As proposed in Chapter 12, Leslie’s subtypes that are based on minor variations in the shape of
the base have been combined, such as Type 2B and 2C are now combined into Type 2B/C. The
six Leslie types used in the analysis, as well as the most common name for each type in the
literature, are as follows: Type 1A (Cameron or a perform), Type 1B/C (Fresno), Type 1D
(Garza), Type 2B/C (Washita), Type 2D/E (Harrell), and Type 2F (Toyah). Each of the 21
contexts was examined, and the proportion of each point type was calculated. Two analyses were
performed on the data: principal components and multidimensional scaling.
The results of the analyses are plotted in Figure 13.10. Both quantitative methods identified
similar partitions among the six projectile point types. Principal component 1 strongly
discriminates Washita and Fresno from the other types. These two point forms are also separated
from other types on Dimension 1 of the multidimensional scaling graph. Both analyses partition
the Harrell and Garza types from Toyah and Cameron (or the Type 1A preform), although it
should be noted that principal component 2 explains less than 16 percent of the variance of the
dataset. Of these groups, the separation of Fresno and Washita from the other four types appears
to be the most robust and consistent of the patterns.

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

Having established that at least two and perhaps three projectile point associations were present
among the contexts at the Merchant site, the next analysis focused on the spatial patterning of
those associations. Another principal components analysis was performed to reduce the
dimensionality of the dataset (Table 13.3), but for the second analysis the data axes were
transposed so that the component loadings were saved for the 21 contexts rather than the six
projectile types. Two principal components account for 97 percent of the variance of the dataset.
A varimax rotation of the data was completed to improve and simplify the variable loadings. On
the rotated matrix, types 1A, 1D, 2D/E, and 2F have the highest loadings on principal component
1 and types 1B/C and 2B/C have the highest on principal component 2.
The component loadings for the 21 contexts are plotted in Figure 13.11. The somewhat positive
linear correlation of the plots indicates that the two principal components are autocorrelated to
some degree. Principal component 2 has high loadings on Washita and Fresno and lower
loadings on Garza, Harrell, and Toyah. However, Washita and Fresno are by far the most
common point types across the site and have very high sample numbers relative to other types.
Accordingly, all contexts generally have high loadings on Fresno and Washita which contributes
to the patterning in Figure 13.11.

Figure 13.11. Plot of principal components of pit structure fills and refuse areas.

A clear partition is visible in the plots. For simplicity we can refer to the two groups as “early”
and “late.” What is intriguing and potentially significant is that there is an intuitive correlation
between contexts with negative loadings for “late” types and their stratigraphic positions. The
lowermost stratum and occupation of Pit Structure 1 (Zone H-I), Refuse D (superimposed by
Room 4), and Zones E and F (lowermost fill of the upper occupation of PS 1 before and during
the closure event of Zone E) have negative loadings on principal component 1, reflecting the fact
that all have few, and in some cases no, “late” projectile point types.
In contrast, the post-closure deposits of Pit Structure 1 (Zone B and C and the composite upper
fill group), Refuse Area A, Pit Structure 2 and the adjacent Refuse Area B have positive loadings
on principal component 1, reflecting the finding that ”late” point types such as Garza, Harrell,
and Toyah were more common among these contexts. The solution is not perfect as Zone A, the
uppermost stratum of Pit Structure 1, has an anomalous plot that, according to the temporal
assumptions of the model, should be on the positive axis of principal component 1. Also of
interest is that Zone E, the bone layer deposited during the ritual closure of the civic-ceremonial
room, plots separately from all the contexts.
The next question is whether similar patterning can be detected among the domestic rooms
(Figure 13.12). The plot of domestic rooms on the two axes exhibits a greater degree of dispersal
and variation, or statistical “noise,” than the preceding plot. Nevertheless, again, we can detect
patterns that make intuitive sense when considered against the archaeological and stratigraphic
record provided by Robert Leslie. First, Rooms 3 and 8 plot among the “early” cluster of
projectile points and contexts. Recalling from Chapter Five that these two structures were
superimposed by the later construction of Rooms 4 and 15, respectively, the correlation of these
400

Chapter Thirteen

rooms with the “early” point group further confirms that the statistical model reflects an
underlying archaeological reality. Note that Room 3 plots very close to Refuse D, an extramural
pit that was probably associated with the occupation of that room.

Rooms plotting among the “later” point group and contexts include Room 4, which was built over
Room 3, and Rooms 9 and 10 that adjoined Room 15 that was constructed over “early” Room 3.
It is difficult to evaluate Rooms 5, 6, and 21 since there is little architectural, spatial, or
stratigraphic information to provide a foundation for interpreting these rooms. Room 7 plots
among the “late” group, and it is interesting to note that this room is located more than 75 m
south of the roomblocks and pit structures.
The analysis is not perfect, and there are questions regarding the possible mixing of assemblages,
incorrect provenience assignments from looted rooms or strata, and other matters. It is also
evident that there is some degree of statistical noise in the study. Despite all the problems with
the excavations and data, it was nevertheless still possible to identify some patterning in the
projectile point data. Quite frankly, it is rather astonishing that any form or manifestation of
robust and meaningful patterning could be extracted from the LCAS excavation data. The
patterns brought to light in the discussion offer intriguing insights into site formation and the
history of occupation at the Merchant site, suggesting that things were much more complex than a
simple dichotomy between pit structures and surface rooms. These matters are the subject of the
final statements on the site.

401

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

What the Merchant Site Means
Despite the initial concern whether the remedial mitigation of the Merchant site would yield new
information and insights, all who were involved with the project recognized the potential
significance of the site for understanding Late Prehistoric adaptation and social evolution on the
southern Plains. Moreover, it was hoped that data on architecture and material culture might lend
new insights to the debates over whether certain cultural “complexes” in southeastern New
Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, and central Texas reflected hunter-gatherers adopting
Southwestern agricultural and technological practices, or migrants from the Southwest moving to
the Plains and adopting hunting strategies and associated tool technologies from extant Plains
groups. Or perhaps something more complex took place, involving movement of groups into
multi-ethnic communities. Each of these would have necessitated new practices of adaptation
and enculturation that forged new forms of social identity. These related questions were in the
forefront during the fieldwork, laboratory studies, and production of this report, and have been
reviewed throughout this summary chapter.
Clearly the architecture and material culture of the Merchant site and other Ochoa phase
settlements represents a mixture or hybrid or something entirely new of Southwest and Plains
traditions. The final summary statement draws together the information on architecture,
chronology, subsistence, artifacts, and other material culture to arrive at a revised and refined
conception of Ochoa phase settlement in southeastern New Mexico.
The location of the Merchant site at the margins—or what should more fittingly be considered the
boundaries and frontiers—of several prehistoric culture regions of the eastern and southeastern
Southwest and the southern Plains was a focal point of archaeological inquiry and the foundation
of the research design for the investigations. During the field and laboratory work, while
examining Leslie’s archives, and particularly while discussing the site among various staff,
specialists, and researchers, one term was consistently repeated: “outlier.” The large and deep pit
structures were similar to kivas and other civic-ceremonial structures of the Southwest and thus
represent an “outlier” for the expression of this architectural form. The possible agricultural grid
gardens would represent another outlier, as does the local production of a unique corrugated ware
that may have derived from other Southwestern corrugated ceramic traditions. On the other
hand—or perhaps more appropriately phrased as on the other direction—the presence of a variety
of formal unifacial and stylized bifacial tool forms are straight out of Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric Plains big game hunting traditions and thus might be considered a western outlier of
such technology.
I approach this debate with some trepidation. Coming from a Southwest background, I have
some concern that my interpretations are influenced by my Southwest experience and biases.
Specialists in the Late Prehistoric period of the southern Plains will probably see Plains things at
the Merchant site, Southwestern researchers will see Southwest things, and both may consciously
or subconsciously perceive their group as the adopter and not the adoptee of the other’s
technology and culture.
It should also be noted that these questions and concepts are not new. Collins (1968) interpreted
the features and material culture from the Ochoa phase Salt Cedar site as migrants from
Southwestern agricultural communities, while Wiseman (2000) views the Merchant site as Plains
groups that adopted Southwestern horticultural practices and ceramic technology.
One might argue that the balance of the evidence leans to the Southwest: the civic-ceremonial
structures and ritual retirement of such structures, corrugated ceramics, possible gridded
agricultural fields, and perhaps even components of prehistoric Southwestern iconography and
ideology are expressed at the Merchant site. Yet it must also be acknowledged that full-blown
Plains unifacial and bifacial tool technologies are not simply “adopted” by a social group and do
402

Chapter Thirteen
The Merchant Site in Hindsight and Foresight

not simply appear at their settlement. The enculturative practices surrounding the incorporation
of new technologies requires some period of prior exposure and experience, often spanning more
than one generation. The domestic architecture also seems to have more of a Plains flavor or
derivation.
Given the present state of knowledge, the problem of Southwest or Plains origins of the Ochoa
phase people may be irresolvable, that is, unless and until DNA analysis on burial populations or
some other means of directly identifying and tracking the human populations of southeast New
Mexico can be attempted. But here I take a different path. Perhaps the debate over “Southwest
migrants becoming Plains” or “Plains migrants becoming Southwesterners” should not be the
primary focus of inquiry. There is something much more complex and much more intriguing for
understanding prehistoric adaptation and social evolution on the southern Plains.
Technological change and social production quite often occur at the peripheries, margins, and
frontiers of so-called core areas, and some of the findings at Merchant may reflect such frontier
processes. Several essential qualities of the Merchant site, some of which are new and
unexpected revelations, were outlined in the preceding topical discussions of this chapter. The
Merchant site was an intensively occupied pueblo-like settlement comprised of multiple
households and had a complex history of occupation. Civic-ceremonial structures were
constructed, used, and retired by the inhabitants. The subsistence base was a mix of maize-based
agriculture, wild plant foods such as mesquite and acorns, and big game hunting.
Social processes were interwoven throughout all these components. The most visible expression
of this is found in the biography of Pit Structure 1. The lower floor marks the first use of this
civic-ceremonial structure. At some time the floor was abandoned and covered by deposits of
trash followed by a layer of natural sediment. It cannot be determined whether the infilling was
intentional or if the structure was simply abandoned for some period of time. A second floor was
built and this too was abandoned. The evidence for ritual retirement of the structure as part of the
second occupation is stronger. A layer of trash was again deposited, followed by a layer of mass
animal bone that the available evidence confirms was an intentional depositional event. These
deposits were then buried by another natural deposit followed by three layers of refuse.
At some time during one or another of the two occupations of Pit Structure 1, the construction of
Pit Structure 2 was begun. Whether or not that structure was finished is unresolved. Also
unresolved are the chronological and settlement relationships between the three pit structure
events and the surrounding rooms and roomblocks, although the distributions of projectile points
offer some critical clues, indicating that certain rooms and pit structure use episodes can be
divided into at least two periods. There may have even been a change in the resident social
groups during the latter occupation or at the end of that occupation.
These are interesting patterns, but the current suite of dates and dating methods do not have the
chronometric resolution to confirm or refute these observations. Perhaps careful stratigraphic
excavation of rooms and refuse areas might provide age estimates from annual plant remains and
XAD-purified collagen from animal bones that would be amenable to terminus post quem and
terminus ante quem constraints in Bayesian analysis, but that is something for future excavators
to decide.
Despite the chronological issues with site formation and specific details of the occupational
history of Pit Structure 1 and the Merchant site as a whole, there nevertheless are several
observations that lead to key conclusions regarding migration, ethnogenesis, and ethnicity during
the Late Prehistoric period on the southern Plains. Kivas and civic-ceremonial structures serve to
both define and mirror the relationships among resident social groups as well as serving to
integrate those groups, and are “… constructed by people in response to their needs and their
conception of how both their community and universe are ordered (Hegmon 1989:5).” Therefore,
403

The Merchant Site
A Late Prehistoric Ochoa Phase Settlement in Southeastern New Mexico

in a larger sense, architecture does not only reflect social structure, but actively reproduces and
reinforces that structure, and thus it may be stated that social relationships and social production
are materialized through architecture.
Social production via kivas and civic-ceremonial structures continued throughout the life history
of such structures, including their retirement, closure, or termination. The retirement of kivas and
civic-ceremonial structures in the southern Southwest was directly linked to changes in resident
social organization or the abandonment of villages (Adams 2016; Creel and Anyon 2003; Miller
and Graves 2009; Varien 1999), and it can be assumed with some confidence that similar social
processes prevailed at the Merchant site. The remodeling and closure events seen in Pit
Structure 1 reflect changes in the social order of the Merchant site. The retirement and closure of
the lower floor and subsequent remodeling and use of Pit Structure 1 may have been linked to the
arrival of another group and expansion of the roomblock. How Pit Structure 2 may have related
to these events—if it was even constructed and used at all during the time of Pit Structure 1—
remains uncertain, but it certainly was a further architectural manifestation of social processes at
the site.
The Zone E deposit of mass animal bone in Pit Structure 1 is one of the most fascinating and
significant components of the site, and was related to what was probably one the most fascinating
and significant social events in the biography of the Merchant site. Unfortunately, we lack the
precise chronological and stratigraphic-artifactual data to fully place the deposit in a proper
context. All the available evidence points to the fact the deposit was not a simple layer of trash,
but rather was a structured or ritual deposit (Richards and Thomas 1984; Thomas 1991; Walker
1995, 1996, 2002) created through an act of ritual retirement and closure. The question is: what
kind of ritual retirement and by whom was it performed? By the residents of the Merchant site in
response to a change in the social order who then constructed Pit Structure 2? By the residents of
the Merchant site merging with another group? By a new resident group who performed some
fashion of costly signaling by closing the civic architecture of the previous or displaced residents
with a mass of bone from a feasting event? We don’t have the answer to this question, and given
the circumstances of the excavation and collections, it may not be possible to answer it.
However, it provides for some interesting speculation. A central question is how the mass of
animal bone, almost certainly related to a feast of large game, was related to the retirement of the
civic-ceremonial structure. Feasting is a form of commensal politics with a host of entangled
social, ritual, labor, and economic components (Adams 2004; Dietler and Hayden 2001), all of
which were present in the prehispanic Southwest (Wills et al. 2004). The typical process of
structural retirement in the Southwest was through burning, along with acts such as the placement
of termination objects and layers of ash, collapse of walls, and covering with layers of domestic
trash.
Perhaps we are seeing something different at the frontier of the Southwest and the Plains. At the
Henderson site, Speth (2004b, 2004c) describes large roasting pit complexes that had been
emptied of fill, had closure offerings of articulated turkeys placed below, and were then covered
in deposits of trash, burned rock, and most of the bison bone from the site. As with other large
pueblo villages of the Southwest, the open plaza of the Henderson site and its roasting pit
complexes served as socially-integrative spaces, and the closure and retirement of that space with
a structured deposit of mass bison bone is very reminiscent of Zone E at the Merchant site, the
only tangible difference being that the closure rituals at Henderson pueblo were manifested at a
larger social and spatial scale.
The alternative to civic architecture, feasting, and other integrative and communal social
processes is often conflict. There is clear evidence of violence at Bloom Mound and Smokey Bear
ruin (Speth and Newlander 2012; Wiseman 1997), as well as within the Ochoa settlement sphere
404

itself as observed among burials with embedded projectile points at the Salt Cedar site (Collins
1968). Whether these episodes of violence were related to displaced populations or conflict over
bison hunting territories and how they related temporally and culturally to the closure deposits at
Merchant and Henderson is a question for future research.
While there are many unanswered questions and much speculation surrounding the Merchant site
and its inhabitants, there is one overarching conclusion that can be drawn from the 1959-1965 and
2015 investigations: The collective observations on architecture and material culture establish
that the inhabitants of the Merchant site—whether involving one or several resident groups—
forged new social identities and perhaps even some manner of hybrid material culture on the
southern Plains of the 1300s and early 1400s. Whatever groups occupied the site, and wherever
they came from, they merged architectural forms and technologies from surrounding regions into
a new aggregate and hybrid expression of social identity and the materialized expression of that
identity (Arnn 2012; Liebmann 2013). In a recent analysis of migration and ethnicity in the
prehispanic Southwest, Stone (2015) presents a model outlining how decisions made by social
agents among migrant and indigenous communities acting within the constraints of existing social
formations may result in different patterns of ethnic expression.
In the case of the Merchant site, the key to identifying this process lies with the Ochoa ceramic
tradition. As noted earlier in this chapter, Ochoa Indented Corrugated is a visually and texturally
unique type of decoration that is a distinct technological and stylistic expression of Southwestern
corrugated ceramics. The creation of this unique ware among the Ochoa phase people of
southeastern New Mexico is a visible and prominent identifier of the new social identity of the
Ochoa phase migrant communities.
Moreover, if the shell pendant was a crudely executed portrayal of a horned serpent, it would
signal the transport of at least one prominent component of Southwest cosmology to the southern
Plains. Placemaking is another component of the formation of social identity and plays an
important role in migration. Migrants often transport their cosmology and associated landscape
topology that link landscape features of their new surroundings to geographic features and
associated cosmologies of their homelands (Eiselt 2012).
And finally, we should not lose sight of the environmental and ecological contexts of the Ochoa
phase and cultural developments of the 1300s and 1400s across southern New Mexico, TransPecos Texas, and the southern Plains (Railey et al. 2009, 2011). The drastic decline in
radiocarbon age estimates during the Medieval Warm Period and subsequent expansion of pueblo
agricultural traditions and bison hunting traditions were undoubtedly related to changes in
precipitation and biomass, including the expansion or contraction of grasslands versus desert
shrub communities and the attendant expansion and contraction of bison, deer, and antelope
foraging ranges. The environmental conditions were also related to the expansion of agricultural
pueblo settlements throughout the Jornada and Salinas regions.
The manner in which the Plains hunters and pueblo agriculturalists interacted—whether
symbiotically through exchange, by merging and creating new expressions of ethnicity and
identity, or through conflict and warfare—is an important and fascinating topic of investigation
for Southwestern and Plains prehistory and broader anthropological theory. The Merchant site
and other Ochoa phase settlements of southeastern New Mexico have much to offer for such
pursuits.
