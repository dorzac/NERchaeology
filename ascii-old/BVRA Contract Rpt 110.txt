ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a Phase I archaeological
survey of a 142 acre tract in southern Galveston County, Texas in November 2002
under the supervision of William E. Moore (Principal Investigator) and James E. Warren
(Project Archaeologist). This work was sponsored by developer Frank Jones of Gifford
Builders, Inc. in Houston, Texas under United States Army Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District, permit number 22590. The project area, an upland ridge five feet
above the low-lying marsh to the north, had not been previously examined by
professional archaeologists. The survey crew concentrated their efforts on this upland
area, a setting where significant archaeological sites are known to occur. One
prehistoric site (41GV148) consisting of six chert flakes between 30 and 40 cm in a fine
sand was found in the southwest corner of the project area on high ground overlooking
Tucker Bayou to the south. The flakes are similar enough to speculate that they came
from the same core. This site is not significant and does not warrant further work. The
only historic evidence in the project area consists of a foundation construction with shell
and concrete (shellcrete) adjacent to modern pens used for the cattle that currently
graze on this tract. The age of the foundation is not known, and it is believed to have
supported an out building such as a shed. It is not significant. BVRA recommends that
Gifford Builders, Inc. be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Copies of the
report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division; the Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District; the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, Texas; and BVRA in Bryan, Texas. The artifact return is meager and not worthy
of permanent curation at TARL. Since the site is on private property, the flakes were
given to the landowner.

INTRODUCTION
Developer Frank Jones of Houston, Texas is applying for a Corps of Engineers
(COE) permit to develop the Anchor Bay Subdivision on west Galveston Island (Figure
1) in southern Galveston County, Texas. Although the entire area owned by Mr. Jones
is 500 acres, only 142 acres are being reviewed by the COE for a building permit.
Water sources in the area consist of West Bay on the north, Tucker Bayou on the south,
Oxen Bayou on the east, and Melager Cove and Mentzel Bayou on the west (Figure 2).
Mentzel Bayou is referred to as Mensell Bayou in the soil survey for Galveston County.
The 142 acre tract is situated on the high ground, marked by the five foot contour on the
topographic map, and overlooks the lower, marsh to the north. Although construction at
this site will take many forms, the most disturbance will be in the form of new canals that
will connect the subdivision with the existing Spanish Grant Canal.
The project area is depicted on the United States Geological Survey 7.5'
quadrangle map Lake Como provisional edition dated 1994 (Figure 3). Additionally, the
project area is depicted on sheets 30 and 34 of the Soil Survey of Galveston County,
Texas authored by Gerald W. Crenwelge, et al. (1988). The United States Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District and the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division, are the federal and state agencies overseeing this project with the Corps of
Engineers the lead reviewer.
The purpose of the archaeological investigation is to identify and assess any
sites in the 142 acre project area. This part of Galveston County is located in a high
probability for the presence of significant archaeological sites. In fact, a prehistoric
cemetery (41GV66) is located approximately 2000 meters southwest of the project area
on a similar landform. Because of the high probability of a significant site within the
project area, a Phase I archaeological survey was recommended by the COE. In order
to satisfy this requirement, Gifford Builders, Inc. of Houston, Texas retained BVRA to
perform this investigation. A Phase I survey was conducted by BVRA on November 1921, 2002 under COE permit 22590.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information is taken from the soil survey for Galveston County
(Crenwelge et al. 1988:1). Galveston County is located in the southeast part of Texas
along the Gulf of Mexico and has a total area of 424,961 acres. Generally, the land
surface is characterized as broad and nearly level with elevation ranges from sea level
to about 45 feet in the northwest part of the county.
The modern climate of Galveston County consists of hot and humid summers
and mild winters. In winter, the average temperature is 47 degrees Fahrenheit, and the
average daily temperature is 33 degrees. In summer, the average temperature is 83
degrees, and the average daily temperature is 87 degrees. Total annual precipitation is
39.73 inches. Of this amount, 23 inches (60%) usually falls in April through September.
A check of the soil survey for Galveston County revealed four soil types within
the current project area (Figure 4). These are Mustang fine sand (Mn); Mustang Nasscomplex (Mt); Mustang fine sand, slightly saline-strongly saline complex (Ms); and
Karankawa mucky loam (Ka). The majority of the project area is in the uplands in Mn
soils above the five foot contour line above the Ms, Mt, and Ka soils.
Mustang fine sand (Mn) soils are nearly level, poorly drained, non-saline, and
sandy. It is located in the coastal areas (Crenwelge et al. 36). Typically, this soil has a
surface layer that is mildly alkaline, dark gray fine sand about three inches thick. The
upper part of the underlying material, to a depth of seven inches, is moderately alkaline,
grayish-brown fine sand. The lower part to a depth of 60 inches is moderately alkaline,
gray fine sand. This soil is rapidly permeable above the high water table, and surface
runoff is very slow. The high water table is within one foot of the surface during most of
the year.
Mustang Nass-complex (Mt) consists of gently undulating, poorly drained and
very poorly drained, non-saline to moderately saline, sandy soils (Crenwelge et al. 3839). These soils are on a series of old, abandoned beach ridges and in wet swales that
parallel the Gulf of Mexico. The soils in this complex are rapidly permeable above the
high water table. The surface runoff is very slow.
Mustang fine sand, slightly saline-strongly saline complex (Ms) is a nearly level to
gently sloping, poorly drained, non-saline and saline, sandy soil (Crenwelge et al. 3738). It generally parallels the area immediately above the tidal influence of the bays that
are associated with Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Typically, this soil has a
surface layer of dark grayish-brown fine sand about 18 inches thick. The underlying
material, to a depth of 60 inches, is fine sand that is grayish-brown in the upper part and
gray in the lower part. This soil is moderately alkaline throughout. The soils in this
mapping unit are rapidly permeable above the high water table. Surface runoff is very
slow.

The marshy area consists of Ka soils (Crenwelge et al. 1988:22-23). This is a
nearly level, very poorly drained, saline, loamy soil that has a loamy subsoil and is
found in the tidal marshes. Typically this soil has a surface layer that is about 18 inches
thick. It is a dark gray mucky loam in the upper 10 inches and dark gray mucky fine
sandy loam in the lower part. The upper part of the underlying material, to a depth of 38
inches, is light gray fine sandy loam. The lowest part to a depth of 60 inches is light
gray loamy fine sand. This soil is moderately rapidly permeable. The surface runoff is
very slow. The high water table allows for very little water movement through the soil.
This soil remains saturated throughout the year. It is covered daily with 2 to 12 inches
of water during high tide and is frequently flooded by spring tides, storm tides, and
rainstorms.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the site records by Allegra Azulay, Assistant Curator of Records at
TARL in Austin, Texas, revealed no previous investigations by professional
archaeologists had been conducted in the project area. Numerous archaeological
studies have, however, been conducted in the county. The earliest account of
archaeological remains on Galveston Island were noted by Simmons (1908) who
reported human remains in a letter from James Douglas in the Bulletin of the American
Geographical Society. In 1957, Thomas Nolan Campbell (1957) reported on the Caplen
site. His work represents the first professional study of a Galveston County site. In the
1960s, studies were conducted at the Jamaica Beach site (41GV5) on Galveston Island
(Aten 1965).
The first large scale study in the county centered around the Clear Creek Flood
Control Project in Galveston and Harris counties and included survey (McGuff and Cox
1973; Mercado-Allinger et al. 1984; Howard et al. 1992) and testing (Fields and Jackson
1984; Bailey et al. 1987; Howard and Freeman 1990; Howard et al. 1991; Hines 1992).
In the immediate area, one very thorough study by Robert A. Ricklis (1994)
resulted in the recording of a prehistoric cemetery and camp site (41GV66)
approximately 2000 meters to the southwest of the current project area. This site, first
recorded in 1974 by Houston Archeological Society member Louis Fullen. In the 1970s,
the Mitchell Ridge site was examined by Rice University, the Texas Archeological
Society, and the Houston Archeological Society. Later, extensive excavations were
conducted in 1992 by Coastal Archaeological Research, Inc. for the Woodlands
Corporation. Two separate areas yielding refuse from domestic use and a prehistoric
cemetery were examined. In all, four small aboriginal cemeteries were investigated
dating to the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Early Historic periods. Of special
interest is the apparent mixing of European and Native Americans in the cemeteries.
According to radiocarbon dates on hearth features and burials, "occupation was scant
prior to A.D. 700/800, after which time it apparently intensified, to continue into the Early
Historic Period" (Ricklis 1994:iii). In addition to the detailed monograph by Ricklis
(1994), the interested reader is referred to two major works that discuss in detail the
archaeology of Southeast Texas. These are Indians of the Upper Texas Coast by
Lawrence E. Aten (1983) and The Archeology and Bioarcheology of the Gulf Plain
(Story et al. 1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator discussed the project with the
lead reviewer for this project, Tiffany Terneny, Staff Archaeologist of the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.
According to Ms Terneny, no
archaeological sites are known to exist in the project area. Ed Baker, reviewer at the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, was also contacted. Mr. Baker
elected to defer to the COE regarding the manner in which the field survey would be
conducted. Next, relevant reports involving previous archaeological research on the
island and elsewhere in the county were reviewed in order to become familiar with the
kinds of sites known to occur in the area.
The Phase I Intensive Field Survey was performed using the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing. The field survey crew concentrated their efforts on
an upland ridge in the approximate center of the project area. Based on previous
archaeological work in this part of the county, this landform is viewed to be the most
likely area for the occurrence of prehistoric sites. The survey crew followed east-west
transects of varying widths. The more common method of 30 meter transects was not
considered practicable because of obstacles such as the private road on the property,
highlines, fences, and fire ant mounds. Distances between shovel tests were measured
with a 30-meter tape and the bearings between tests were taken with a hand-held
compass. Most tests were dug at 40-meter intervals with some exceptions. Two areas
were recommended for shovel testing by COE Archaeologist Tiffany Terneny. These
are the main project area at or above the five foot contour (Area A), and a narrow
peninsula adjacent to Mentzel Bayou (Area B). Area B was found to be greatly
disturbed by the presence of a large dredge spoil pile which covered much of this
landform. The rest of Area B was under water, making it impossible to investigate.
These two areas are illustrated on the project area map (Figure 2).
Shovel tests were 30 x 50 cm in size and dug to a maximum depth of 70 cm;
some tests were terminated earlier due to the shallow water table or the presence of
shell that was viewed as a possible relict beach. Each test was recorded on a shovel
test log (Appendix I) and discussed in the project notes. The excavated matrix was
screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth. In all, 40 shovel tests were excavated. The
locations of all shovel tests are depicted on the project area map (Figure 2). After
finding six chert flakes in Shovel Test 6, eight additional tests were dug in the four
cardinal directions in order to define the site boundaries, recover diagnostic artifacts,
and locate any features that might be present. Profiles were drawn of the shovel tests.
Since the tests consist of homogenous sand throughout the tests, profiles of these tests
are not presented in this report.

Although the flakes at site 4GV148 are viewed by BVRA as an isolated find, a
TARL trinomial was assigned. It is possible that additional cultural materials may be
present in the site area; however, only one in nine shovel tests yielded cultural
materials. Because of the small size of this collection no formal analysis of the flakes
was conducted.
The field survey crew also looked for the presence of historic sites that might be
visible in the form of features or artifact scatters on the surface. One such feature was
found. This is a shell and concrete foundation near some modern cattle pens. This
foundation, believed to be the support for an outbuilding such as a shed was not viewed
as significant. It was measured and noted on the project area map. No photographs
were taken.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This investigation covered the 142-acre area proposed for a subdivision in
southern Galveston County, Texas. A review of site records at the Texas Archeological
Laboratory in Austin, Texas revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area. According to Tiffany Terneny, Staff Archaeologist of the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, no formal investigations by professional
archaeologists have been conducted in the current project area. A major prehistoric site
containing camp refuse and four cemeteries (41GV66) is located on a similar landform
approximately 2000 meters to the southwest of the project area.
Shovel testing recovered six chert flakes in one test (ST 6), and no diagnostic
artifacts or features were observed. This locality, given the temporary number TS-1 in
the field, has been recorded with TARL as site 41GV148 (Figure 5). Based on the
limited number of artifacts found in a small area (one shovel test), not much can be said
regarding this site. The six flakes are chert and incomplete (i.e., flake fragments). They
are all interior flakes lacking cortex. The color is a brownish chert. The only activity that
can be associated with these specimens is some form of tool manufacture or retouch.
That eight additional shovel tests in the immediate area were negative helps support the
hypothesis that this is an isolated activity area where no long term occupation took
place.
The only evidence of historic activity in the project area other than the current
use of the site as a pasture for cattle is the presence of a foundation made of shell and
concrete. It is believed that this served as the support for an outbuilding such as a
shed. The feature was measured in the field as 630 cm x 730 cm with a height of 15
cm. This foundation is not significant.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant archaeological sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that Gifford Builders, Inc. be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be found during construction in
areas not mentioned in this report, all work must cease until the situation can be
evaluated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Staff Archeologist, in
conjunction with BVRA and Gifford Builders, Inc.
