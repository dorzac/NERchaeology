Cultural Resources Survey of the NextDecade, LLC, Rio Grande Liquefied Natural Gas Export Terminal,
Port of Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Ecology and Environment, Inc. and NextDecade, LLC, SWCA conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the proposed 1,000-acre Rio Grande Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Export
Terminal Project (Project) in Cameron County, Texas, along the Brownsville Ship Channel in the Rio
Grande Delta. Because the Project will occur on land owned by the Port of Brownsville (a political
subdivision of Texas), the Project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Cultural resources
investigations were therefore conducted to comply with the ACT under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
7249. Additionally, the Project is anticipated to require permits issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Accordingly, the investigations were also
conducted to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) and its implementing regulations
(36 Code of Federal Regulations 800). The area of potential direct effects is anticipated to cover the entire
1,000-acre LNG facility with deep impacts expected. Assessment of indirect effects was not conducted as
part of these investigations, but would be conducted if the site is deemed feasible for the facility locale.
A review of geological maps, soil surveys, historic maps and aerials revealed the vast majority of the
Project area consists of either artificial lands formed by dredge or existing water bodies. Over 84 percent
of the property consists of tidal flats, water, artificial levees, or dredge that filled in shallow bays, areas
with a low potential for cultural resources. As such, the areas likely to contain intact cultural material
were limited to a few landforms, most notably lomas, that cover 163 acres of the 1,000-acre Project area.
A background literature review identified one previous intensive survey and two informal surveys that
overlap portions of the current Project area. The investigations recorded three archaeological sites within
the 1,000-acre Project area; an additional five sites are within a 0.5-mile radius of the Project area. The
three sites within the Project area include 41CF8, 41CF135, and 41CF191, all prehistoric or historic
Native American sites. Site 41CF8, the Garcia Pasture site, is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) as a heavily eroded and looted historical Indian camp and burial ground. A small portion
of site 41CF8 is recorded as extending into the Project area. Site 41CF135 is a secondarily deposited
scatter of prehistoric artifacts identified within dredge spoils along with thousands of Rangia and oyster
shells. Site 41CF191 consists of a small concentration of approximately a dozen unworked shell
fragments, but no clearly associated cultural materials. A review of historic maps determined there are no
historic-age structures or features within or adjacent to the APE and that the area has been subject to
extensive modification since dredging of the Brownsville Ship Channel began around 1930.
During the cultural resources survey, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 1,000-acre tract with
specific focus on proposed locations of 47 geotechnical and geophysical borehole locations, previously
recorded archaeological sites, and loma formations identified as having a high probability to contain
cultural material. The Garcia Pasture site and its slight extension into the Project area was a primary
concern. A total of 144 shovel tests were excavated during the investigations, only one of which was
positive for cultural material on site 41CF8. Based on the results of the investigation, which included the
excavation of 60 shovel tests in and around 41CF8, the portion of site 41CF8 within the Rio Grande LNG
Project area does not contribute to the siteâs overall NRHP significance. As such, SWCA recommends no
additional investigations for the portion of site 41CF8 within the current Project area.
No cultural material was encountered in the locations of sites 41CF135 and 41CF191, both of which have
been substantially affected by erosion. Site 41CF135 was reported in an entirely disturbed secondary
depositional context and may have been further buried by subsequent dredge materials. 41CF191 was
originally documented as a site despite the absence of cultural material. Shovel tests placed at each of the
47 bore locales were all negative, yielding no cultural materials. The shovel testing combined with often
abundant surface exposures provided extensive coverage of the Project area. Based on the negative results
of SWCAâs investigations of these areas, neither site is recommended as eligible for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark or for the NRHP. Accordingly, no further investigation is recommended for the
1,000-acre Project area.

process for its Rio Grande LNG Project. FERC
granted this request on March 23, 2015, and
assigned Pre-Filing Docket Number PF15-20-000.
As a preliminary assessment of the suitability of
the site, the geotechnical firm Fugro will be
conduct 47 geophysical and geotechnical borehole
tests to assess the geological integrity of the
Project area.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Ecology and Environment, Inc. and
NextDecade, LLC, SWCA conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the proposed Rio
Grande Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal
Project (Project) along the Brownsville Ship
Channel (BSC) in eastern Cameron County, Texas
(Figure 1). NextDecade is requesting authorization
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) to construct, own, and operate a natural
gas liquefaction and LNG export facility and an
associated
pipeline
system,
respectively.
Consequently, the survey was conducted in
compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (54 U.S.C.
306108) and its implementing regulations (36 Code
of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800). Additionally,
since the facility will be located on lands owned by
the Port of Brownsville, a political subdivision of
the state, the investigations were conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT) under Antiquities Permit 7249.

The area of potential effects (APE) is defined (at
36 CFR 800.16) as the geographic area within
which an undertaking may directly or indirectly
cause alterations in the character or use of historic
properties. The direct APE is expected to include
the entire 1,000-acre site, in which deep grounddisturbing activities will occur. The APE for
indirect effects will be defined at a later date after
the siteâs feasibility is determined. The assessment
of indirect effects is not part of the current study.

OVERVIEW OF INVESTIGATIONS
SWCAâs cultural resources investigations included
a background review and intensive pedestrian
survey with subsurface investigations of 47
predetermined borehole locations, all previously
documented archaeological sites, and natural intact
portions of the Project area. A review of historic
maps and aerials revealed lomas (stabilized clay
dunes) are among the few intact areas in the 1,000acre site. Regional site distribution patterns
strongly correlate with these topographical high
points in the otherwise nearly level landscape.
Dredge, levees, and other modifications have
substantially altered the area. Focusing on intact
areas, the purpose of the work was to locate and
identify cultural resources in the Project area,
establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as
appropriate with regard to the Project area, and
evaluate the significance and eligibility for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) for all sites recorded within the
Project area. SWCA archaeologists Matthew
Stotts, Laura Acuna, Matt Carter, Shannon Smith,
and Melissa Garcia conducted the fieldwork on
April 13â17, 2015.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND AREA OF
POTENTIAL EFFECTS
The proposed facility will be constructed within a
1,000-acre area on the north side of the BSC and is
sited between the eastern end of the main channel
at Laguna Madre and the turning basin at the
western end of the BSC. The terminal will have
six LNG liquefaction trains, each with a nominal
capacity of 4.5 million metric tons per annum
approximately 0.6 billion cubic feet per day, four
LNG storage tanks, two marine jetties for oceangoing LNG vessels, and on-site power generation.
The terminal will receive natural gas via the Rio
Bravo Pipeline. The natural gas will then be
treated, liquefied, and stored on site at the facility
or loaded onto vessels for export overseas.
On March 20, 2015, NextDecade submitted an
official request to FERC to initiate the Pre-Filing

the Port of Brownsville waterway. Barrada clays
are found on tidal flats covering approximately 27
percent of the Project area. These poorly drained
soils consist of clayey to loamy alluvium. Point
Isabel clay loam, found on lomas where the
majority of prehistoric sites have been recorded in
the area, consists of clayey eolian deposits on the
shoulder and backslope of rises. These soils are up
to 65 inches thick.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Project is on the Rio Grande Delta in the
coastal plain and barrier island area of southern
Texas, approximately 7 miles northeast of
Brownsville. The BSC runs along the southern
margin of the Project area, and State Highway
(SH) 48 runs along the northern margin (Figure 2).
The 1,000-acre area comprises three main
landforms: low-lying tidal areas and water bodies;
flats that are predominantly covered with
spoil/dredge; and lomas. Impacts to the tract
related to dredging of the BSC are extensive.
Additional modern impacts include the
construction of SH 48 and adjacent levee, and
discrete surficial impacts as a result of barbed wire
fence lines and two-track access roads.

The remaining three mapping units that comprise
roughly 12 percent of the Project area include two
soil units and open water bodies. Sejita silty clay
loam (SE) makes up 3.5 percent of the total
Project area and is typically found only a few feet
above sea level along the high water mark. The
surface layer is a light brownish-gray calcareous
silt loam that is 2 inches thick. Below, to a depth
of 20 inches, is a light-gray silty clay loam. The
underlying material, to a depth of 40 inches, is a
very pale brown stratified silty loam, silty clay
loam, or clay loam (NRCS 2015). Lomalta clay
(LM) makes up 2.4 percent of the total Project
area and is typically found in depressions. The
surface layer is a light-gray clay that is found to a
depth of 53 inches. Below, to a depth of 57 inches,
is a light brownish-gray silty clay loam. The
underlying material, found to a depth of 72 inches,
is a stratified pale brown silt loam (NRCS 2015).
Water covers about 6 percent, mainly minor
portions of the north western and southern margins
of the Project area.

SOILS
There are six soil units mapped within the Project
area (see Figure 2) (Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2015). Of these six,
three units make up more than 88 percent of the
Project area. These three soil units in order of
prevalence include Ustifluvents (dredge material,
USX), Barrada clay (BA), and Point Isabel clay
loam (PO) (Table 1).
Ustifluvents make up over 44 percent of the area
and consist of clayey dredge materials secondarily
deposited during construction of nearby canals and

(1950). Many species of mammals, birds, reptiles,
and amphibians occupy or historically occupied
this biotic province; their distribution and densities
vary considerably and are mainly dependent upon
the local vegetation community and available
water resources.

GEOLOGY
Geologically, the Project area consists of Fill and
Spoil (F S), Quaternary Tidal Flat areas (Qal), and
Quaternary Wind-blown (Qcd) deposits (Figure 3).
Approximately half of the Project area is mapped
as fill and spoil deposits consisting of dredged
material along waterways. These sediments
include mud, silt, sand and shell (Fisher 1976)
and, based on their dredged origin, have no
potential to contain intact cultural materials,
although secondary deposits occur within the
formation. Tidal flats include clay, silt, sand,
gravel, and organic matter, but predominantly
mud. Windblown formations include Quaternary
dunes of clay, silt, and sand on elongate
landforms, which represent the areas within the
Project area with the highest potential for
containing intact cultural deposits.

According to Davis and Schmidly (1994),
common small mammals that may occur in the
Project area include the pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), southern plains woodrat
(Neotoma micropus), desert cottontail (Sylvilagus
audubonii), and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus). Large mammal species that occur or
have the potential to occur within the Project area
include
white-tailed
deer
(Odocoileus
virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx
rufus), and javelina (Tayassu tajacu). Ocelot
(Leopardus pardalis) and jaguarondi (Felis
yagouaroundi) are also known to inhabit the dense
thorny scrub of the Rio Grande delta (Davis and
Schmidly 1994; Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988) and
a green bridge was constructed just south of the
Project area in order to connect habitat on Puerta
de Trancas that is otherwise bisected by SH 48.

VEGETATION
The Rio Grande Delta lies within Gould's (1969)
South Texas Plains vegetation region. An
agricultural center since the early part of the
twentieth century, the Rio Grande Delta region
possesses a vegetation community vastly different
from its indigenous species (Jahrsdoerfer and
Leslie 1988). Described by Blair (1950) and
Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie (1988) as Tamaulipan, the
indigenous flora âwould have been composed of
riparian lands and bottom lands deciduous forestsâ
(Kibler and Freeman 1993:3). Today, the regional
vegetation is brush land dominated by mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) and acacia (Acacia sp.).
Other scrub and brush species found in the region
include prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri),
Barbados cherry, or Mexican myrtle, (Malpighia
glabra), and saw greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox).
Portions of the Project area were densely
vegetated, whereas other portions were entirely
denuded, creating a stark contrast in surface
visibility.

Bird species present in the area are typical of the
brush and scrub vegetational community.
Common resident species include the mourning
dove (Zenaida macroura), northern mockingbird
(Mimus polyglottos), house sparrow (Passer
domesticus),
olive
sparrow
(Arremonops
rufivirgatus), the northern bobwhite (Colinus
virginianus), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis),
and long-billed thrasher (Toxostoma longirostre).
Reptiles include the reticulated collared lizard
(Crotaphytus reticulatus), Texas horned lizard
(Phrynosoma cornutum), blue spiny lizard
(Sceloporus
cyanogenys),
mesquite
lizard
(Sceloporus
grammicus),
Texas
tortoise
(Gopherus berlandieri), Kempâs ridley sea turtle
(Lepidochelys kempii), Texas indigo snake
(Drymarchon corais), giant toad (Bufo marinus),
and the Rio Grande lesser siren (Siren intermedia).

WILDLIFE
The proposed Project area lies within the
Tamaulipan biotic province as defined by Blair

Evidence of Paleoindian use of the coastal zone
also comes from isolated finds in eroded or
disturbed contexts. The erosion is in part the result
of a dramatic sea level change associated with the
end of the last glaciation. At that time, sea level
was much lower than today, and the Gulf shoreline
was appreciably farther south of its present
position (Ricklis 2004:1766). As sea level began
to rise, it likely inundated many Paleoindian sites.
Both artifacts and fossil bones have been
recovered from Texas beaches and are believed to
be eroding from submerged, relict deltaic
landforms that contain these ancient sites.

CULTURAL SETTING
Cameron County lies within the South Texas
Plains that is divided into five biogeographical
subareas. The Project area falls within the Rio
Grande Delta subarea. Despite the amount of
previous archaeological research performed in the
Rio Grande Delta, the region lacks well-defined
phases, assemblages, and a projectile point
chronology. The sites recorded in or near the
Project area are Late Archaic to historic sites.
Accordingly, the following overview of the
regional cultural chronology focuses on these later
periods that are most relevant to the findings. The
cultural chronology provides a wider geographical
extent than solely the lower Rio Grande, including
the broader South Texas and Coastal regions.

Toward the end of the Paleoindian period, a
disruption in large game populations may have
precipitated a greater reliance on a broad-based
subsistence strategy. This presumed but probably
overstated change in subsistence strategy has been
used to mark the beginning of the Archaic period.
There also is evidence of climatic fluctuations and
additional episodes of sea level rise within this
period.

PALEOINDIAN
The Paleoindian period marks the arrival of the
first peoples in the final stages of Late Glacial
times when sea levels were substantially lower
than current conditions. Evidence of human
occupation in the Rio Grande Delta is scarce; one
Folsom point recovered from 41CF54 near Laguna
Atascosa is among the few Paleoindian diagnostic
artifacts found in the counties comprising the Rio
Grande Delta. More substantial evidence of
occupations attributable to the period are found
farther inland.

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic from 8800 to 6000 B.P. is
distinguished from the earlier Paleoindian period
by increasing adaptation to regional environments,
more intensive processing of local resources, and
diversification of artifact types and technologies.
The temporal division between Paleoindian and
Archaic patterns is generally around 8800 B.P.
(radiocarbon years) based on several chronologies
and well-dated sites (e.g., Thoms and Clabaugh
2011:85), although a number of authors place the
advent of Archaic ways later in time. Hester
(2004:137) defines the advent of the earliest
clearly Archaic technologies as beginning around
8000 B.P. In coastal areas of South Texas, Ricklis
(2004:161) begins the Early Archaic at
approximately 7500 B.P. when sea level was still
well below current levels. The terminus of the
South Texas Early Archaic is around 6000 to 5500
B.P., but others have it continuing to 4500 to 4200
B.P. (Hester 2004:137; Ricklis 2004:161). Recent
dating of bison bone place of the Calf Creek
horizon, which falls within Hesterâs final horizon
of the Early Archaic, from 5955 to 5815 B.P. in
calibrated calendrical years or about 5100 to 5200

The earliest occupation of the coastal plain
occurred in the Paleoindian period ca. 11,500 to
8,800 years ago. The first half of this period is
marked by the occurrence of Clovis and Folsom
dart points, almost always in isolated contexts.
Although few early sites have been systematically
excavated in the delta, there have been excavated
Paleoindian components on the central coastal
plain of Texas, including the deep terrace sites of
Buckner Ranch located in Bee County, the Berger
Bluff site in Goliad County, and the JohnstonHeller and J-2 Ranch sites in Victoria County. The
Buckner Ranch site produced late Pleistocene
fauna and hearth-like clusters of burned rocks, as
well as Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and
Angostura points (Sellards 1940).

radiocarbon years (Lohse et al. 2014). Considering
the discrepancy between radiocarbon and
calendrical years of about 1000 years at this time,
the different estimated termini of 5500 and 4500
B.P. may be attributable to conversion factors.

LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic period from 4000 to 1000 B.P. is
far better understood than preceding Archaic and
Paleoindian periods and is marked by a
continuation and intensification of adaptations
established in the previous times, but also
coincided with the development of new
technologies and social identities. There were
major environmental fluctuations during the time,
but the general trend was towards conditions that
roughly equate to the historic setting. The period
began with a rapid rise in sea level around 4,000
years ago, submerging river valleys and reaching
the modern stable sea level by about 3,000 years
ago (Ricklis 2004:157). In the course of these
events, barrier islands developed creating
protected
bays
and
extensive
estuarine
environments with high densities of diverse
species. Many models indicate dry conditions in
the beginning that gradually ameliorated to
increasing mesic conditions. Faunal data from
Halls Cave and Bering Sinkhole on the southern
margin of Central Texas indicate relative dry
conditions until 2700 to 2500 B.P. before the shift
to wetter conditions (Toomey et al. 1993:309).
Based on the faunal data, inland environments
were short-grass grassland or desert grassland,
turning to wetter mixed grasslands after circa 2500
to 2000 B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993:309).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC
Data from the comparatively brief Middle Archaic
are unclear on many aspects, engendering very
contradictory interpretations on the nature of
cultural adaptations and the climatic setting during
this mid-Holocene period. Well-documented sites,
such as the Richard Beene site component dating
from 4500 to 4100 years ago, are few and yield
sparse remains, often with the inclusion of
diagnostic artifacts from other periods. Based on
Central Texas data, Johnson and Goode (1994:26)
see the period as having mesic but drying
conditions, and Thoms and Clabaugh (2011:91)
interpret the period as fluctuating between drier
conditions but concluding between 4500 and 4100
B.P. with a cooler wetter climate. Along the
coastal regions, Ricklis identified the period from
5800 to 4200 B.P. as the Middle Holocene
stillstand, a period of stable sea levels, before the
rapid sea level rise beginning around 4200 B.P.
(Ricklis 2004:164). During this stillstand, a period
he originally placed within the Early Archaic but
would now fall within his Middle Archaic based
on his later revised timeframe (e.g., Ricklis
2011:38, see discussion below), Ricklis notes a
prominent increase in the number of
archaeological components. Consequently, in
some areas, site frequency appears to increase, and
in others the archaeological record suggests
perhaps a decline, but such a trend is unclear.

The Late Archaic, as defined here, covers a longer
span of time than many authors have it, three
millennia, beginning earlier than previous
chronologies (e.g., Hall et al. 1986; Hester 2004;
Ricklis 2004:165). The temporal span and cultural
developments in this revised Late Archaic period
are consistent with recent revisions and
improvements in radiocarbon dating that place the
advent around 4000 B.P. (e.g., Lohse et al. 2014;
Ricklis 2011:38). Many cultural and temporal
subdivisions have been devised to partition the
Late Archaic into finer divisions, but there is still
much debate on the validity of various phases,
complexes, and foci. One of the more enduring
divisions is the Aransas focus defined by
Campbell (1947, 1952), and more recently refined
by Weinstein (2002) based on excavations at the
Guadalupe Bay site (41CL2). Weinstein (2002)
defines the Aransas I (2500 to 2100 B.P.), II (2100
to 1900 B.P.), and III (1900 to 1200/1300 B.P.) as

The appearance of projectile point types typical of
other regions (e.g., Bell, Andice, and Pandale) and
marine shell originating from outside the area
suggest an expansion of trade/exchange networks
in the region, although as previously discussed the
Early Archaic Buckeye Knoll site indicates such
networks were already well-established (Ricklis
2011).

covering the final part of the Archaic period.
Ricklis (2011:38) breaks the Late Archaic into
sub-periods I (4000 to circa 2700 B.P.), II (2700 to
1900 B.P.), and III (1900 to 1200 B.P.). His Late
Archaic II roughly corresponds temporally with
Weinsteinâs Aransas I and II, and the Late Archaic
III corresponds temporally with Aransas III.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The technological innovations of ceramics and the
bow and arrow are typically regarded as marking
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric (1,150â350
B.P.) (Black 1989:51; Hester 2004). Prehistoric
sites from this period are often the best preserved,
most distinctive, and visible of all periods in South
Texas. Ceramics dating to this period are generally
bone tempered (Black 1989:52). Late Prehistoric
settlement patterns suggest increased mobility,
perhaps an effect of greater reliance on bison as a
subsistence mainstay. Faunal assemblages dating
to the Late Prehistoric show an increased
consumption of bison, deer, and antelope (Black
1989; Hester 2004). At the Hinojosa Site in Jim
Wells County, the well-preserved faunal remains
associated with a Toyah occupation showed
dependence on deer and antelope, and to a lesser
extent, bison (Black 1986). Adoption and use of
the bow and arrow may have facilitated the shift in
balance between animal and plant foods. In South
Texas, common arrow point types include Perdiz,
Scallorn, Fresno, Starr, and Zavala. The social and
material culture of the period can be inferred to
some degree by the ethnohistorical record, as
discussed below.

Technological hallmarks of the time include
hearths, ovens, burned rock middens, ground stone
such as manos and metates, bedrock mortars,
projectile points, bifaces, bone and shell tools, and
various formal types of gouges, scrapers, and
adzes. Projectile points from the Late Archaic
include Bulverde, Pedernales, Marcos, Shumla,
Ensor, Frio, Fairland, Montell, Morhiss,
Castroville, and Ellis. There is a gradual decrease
in point size from the broad-bladed forms that
predominate until approximately 2200 B.P. with
the advent of the Ensor-Frio-Fairland series.
Coastal sites such as Mustang Lake (41CL3) on
San Antonio Bay and 41SP43 along Ingleside
Cove on Corpus Christi Bay have yielded
evidence to support âa significant intensification
of estuarine resource useâ in Late Archaic, with an
increase in shellfish gathering around 3000 B.P.
and a substantial increase in the reliance on fish by
around 2000 B.P. (Ricklis 2004:165). In the
Aransas Bay area, Campbell (1947, 1952)
designated this period of intensive exploitation of
estuarine resources as the Aransas Focus. Inland,
the presence of grinding implements and large
deposits of burned rocks at the Choke Canyon
sites suggest continued, intensive exploitation of
plant resources in addition to a broad range of
animal species (Hester 2004:140).

In the Rio Grande delta a distinctive but vaguely
understood complex designated the Brownsville
Complex is commonly surmised to have emerged
around A.D. 1250 to 1300, continuing for a couple
centuries until A.D. 1500, although a reanalysis of
the long-held construct shows it is not so easily
defined (Terneny 2005:1). The âcomplex,â for
lack of a better term is primarily defined as a
mortuary complex based on several large
cemeteries in the region (e.g., Ayala [41HG1] and
Floyd Morris [41CF2]) and the extensive use of
shell in implements and decorations. The complex
is called the Barrill Complex in the coastal areas
of Mexico immediately south of Texas, rendering
the boundary between the two an arbitrary one
(Terneny 2005:212, 214). Additionally, the
temporal boundary is also arbitrary since there are
few dates to clearly define it, and the traits
associated with the complex have been shown to
occur in preceding Archaic contexts.

Burial of the dead in cemeteries appears to be
more common in this period as evidenced by
major burial grounds such as the Loma Sandia site
in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley 1995),
Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), Crestmont (Hall 2002),
and numerous other sites.
Distinctive shell tools such as Busycon whorl
scrapers and columella gouges mark Aransas sites.
Similar tools have been recovered from shell
midden sites as far north along the coast as Lavaca
Bay and the lower reach of Caney Creek in
Matagorda County (Fritz 1975:129).

Accordingly, Terneny (2005:211) recommends
abandoning the construct, although there is still a

or drowned while crossing rivers. A few survivors
of the âthe wreck of the 300â made it to the Rio
Grande Delta, but only two ultimately made it
back to the colonial outpost.

configuration of archaeological traits that warrant
further definition. While the use of cemeteries is
often considered evidence of increased social
complexity, in this case cemeteries may have
evolved as a result of limited territoriality and
constrained mobility, not necessarily from
increasingly hierarchical society. For example,
Hester (1969:163) presents a model of huntergatherer fishers in the area maintaining limited
mobility as a result of the rich concentration of
estuarine, riverine, and coastal resourcesâthe
need for long-range movement to exploit dispersed
resources was unnecessary in such a setting.
Additional work is needed to address the
economic basis of society in the area, not only the
subsistence basis but also commerce evident by
the high quantity of trade goods going into (e.g.,
jadeite beads) and out of (e.g., marine shell beads
and ornaments). These exotic goods suggest a
vibrant trade sphere centered at this critical
juncture of environmental and economic contexts.

A group under Jacinto GarcÃ­a de Sepulveda was
sent to explore the area in August 1638; they
crossed the Rio Grande near Mier and marched
down the north bank of the river as far as the site
of present Brownsville (Garza and Long 2015).
Also, on February 27, 1747, JosÃ© de EscandÃ³n
built a raft to sound the Rio Grande just north of
the modern day Matamoros and Brownsville area.
A royal inspection made in 1757 by JosÃ© Tienda
de Cuervo recommended that titles to the land in
the area be given to the colonists, and EscandÃ³n
helped found the colonies of Reynosa (1749),
Camargo (1749), Mier (1750), Revilla (1752), and
Laredo (1755). Down the Rio Grande to the south
of these colonies, San Juan de los Esteros was
established in 1765. After 30 years of tenuous
existence, San Juan de los Esteros was
emboldened by Nuevo LeÃ³n immigrants and
renamed Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Refugio. After
Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821,
Nuestra SeÃ±ora del Refugio was renamed
Matamoros.

HISTORIC PERIOD
(A.D. 1519 TO PRESENT)
The Historic Period for the Brownsville area
begins with the first Spanish entradas when the
first Europeans began to explore and colonize the
region. In 1519, Alonso Alvarez de Pineda was the
first European to reach the Rio Grande delta,
(Scott 1970; Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954).
Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca is cited to have
passed through the area in 1528 (Scott 1970), but
the evidence that he traveled through the Rio
Grande Delta is tenuous.

Mexican independence ushered in a prosperous
time of settlement for the Rio Grande Delta
region. Most of these early settlers were Mexican
ranchers who, in turn, attracted American and
European merchants. Matamoros was established
as a seaport in 1823, and this significantly
increased the economic vitality of the region. This
vitality was largely unaffected by the Texas War
for Independence, since military campaigns were
concentrated further north and west (Webb 1952).

In 1554, a Spanish fleet of four ships laden with
treasures from the New World set sail from
Veracruz heading home to Spain. The fleet carried
over 400 people and a rich cargo. En route to
Cuba, its first harbor along the homeward journey,
a fierce storm drove three ships aground along the
Texas coast off Padre Island a short distance south
of Corpus Christi. One captain managed to salvage
a crippled ship and tenuously returned to
Veracruz, but three hundred passengers were
forced ashore, an unknown number drowning in
the effort. The survivors began to walk southward
along the shoreline hoping to reach the colonial
outpost of Tampico thought to be a only short
distance away. In, the trek back, however, most
survivors were either killed by indigenous groups

The same cannot be said for the Mexican War,
whose formal opening occurred along the Rio
Grande at Matamoros. General Zachary Taylorâs
forces established themselves on the northern side
of the Rio Grande opposite Matamoros in March
of 1846. Responding to the placement of Mexican
artillery, Taylor ordered the construction of a fort,
which included defensive works in the form of sixsided, moated earthworks 800 yards in
circumference and 9 feet tall (Mahr-Yanez and
Pertulla 1995). Mexican artillery fired on the fort
May 3, 1846, while Taylor and the bulk of his

10

railroads turned Brownsville into a major port
during the nineteenth century. In 1837 Charles
Morgan established the first steamship line
between New Orleans and Galveston, which
became the basis for further expansion of the lines
throughout Texas into the southern coast by the
1840s (Baughman 2015). After interruption during
the Civil War, Morgan began integrating railroad
and maritime transport, developing railways that
connected to ports. These developments led to the
founding of Morgan's Louisiana and Texas
Railroad and Steamship Company in 1877.

forces had marched downstream to Port Isabel.
After several days of heavy fighting, the Mexican
troops were turned back. Major Jacob Brown, the
interim commander, died during the attack and
General Taylor, upon hearing this, ordered the fort
to be named Fort Brown (see further discussion
below). The Mexican War ended on July 4, 1848,
after two years of heavy fighting in Mexico.
Immediately following the war, Cameron County
was formed from the Nueces Land District and
named after Ewe Cameron, a Texas soldier
executed in the Black Bean Massacre. Local
merchant and silver mine owner Charles Stillman
bought 4,676 acres adjacent to Fort Brown and, on
December 9, 1848, established the Brownsville
Town Company. The city was incorporated in
1850 and was named the county seat soon after
(Mahr-Yanez and Pertulla 1995).

Rail continued to be a major economic force
throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
According to railroad records, Cameron County
produced 761 freight car shipments of produce in
1907, when the first flood control project was
completed. Shipments totaled 6,307 in 1920, and
in 1930 annual shipments reached 28,113 (Watson
1931).

Business continued to improve up to the beginning
of the Civil War. Confederate forces, under the
direction of General H. P. Bee, assumed control of
Brownsville in 1861 after the peaceful withdrawal
of General Twiggâs Union forces. Brownsville
returned to Union control in November of 1863
after a sizable Union force landed on Brazos
Island, which compelled General Bee to abandon
and burn Fort Brown (Pierce 1917). The
Confederate forces regained Fort Brown in July of
1864 and held it until the end of the war. The last
battle of the Civil War occurred on Palmito Ranch
near Brownsville south of the Project area. On
May 13, 1865, more than a month after Robert E.
Leeâs surrender, opposing forces met for the final
time as the Confederates pushed back federal
troops until reinforcements arrived and a truce was
negotiated.

The Project area landscape was transformed by the
adjacent ship channel and its history of
construction and maintenance. In 1928, residents
of the area approved funds to establish the
Brownsville Navigation District and construct a
ship channel from Brazos Santiago Pass to allow
deep-water vessels to dock in Brownsville. The
voter-approved $2 million provided the initial
impetus, but progress was slow. It was not until
the Public Works Administration provided
additional funds that the 17-mile-long channel,
turning basin and terminal facilities were
completed. The port of Brownsville opened on
May 15, 1936. The channel connects Brownsville
with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and SH 48
runs alongside the channel for most of its length.
The completion of the port made Brownsville the
shipping center for the lower Rio Grande valley
and northeastern Mexico and helped the city to
weather the worst effects of the Great Depression.

The economy of Brownsville and the Rio Grande
Delta suffered after the Civil War, and disorder
escalated following the collapsed fortunes of many
in the area (Rogers 1996). This prompted Union
troops, under the command of General Phillip
Sheridan, to restore order to the region
immediately after the war (Webb 1952).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW

The regional economy grew slowly but steadily
throughout the rest of the nineteenth century until
flood control and irrigation projects contributed to
the success of regional agriculture. Shipping and

Project area to determine the locations and content
of any previous archaeological surveys and
recorded archaeological sites in or near the Project
area. The study included a search of the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database
for surveys, archaeological sites, NRHP
properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical
Markers (OTHMs), Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood
surveys. As a part of the review, an SWCA
archaeologist also reviewed the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay, a
mapping/geographic information system with
historic maps and resource information covering
most portions of the state (Foster et al. 2006).

The shovel tests were approximately 30
centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated to
culturally sterile deposits or impassible basal clay,
whichever came first. The matrix from each shovel
test was screened through Â¼-inch mesh, and the
location of each excavation was plotted using a
hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver. Each shovel test was recorded on a
standardized, electronic form to document the
excavations.
SWCA performed a non-collection survey.
Artifacts encountered were tabulated, analyzed,
and documented in the field, but not collected.

FIELD METHODS

RESULTS

SWCAâs investigations began with defining areas
of specific concern to the Project and areas with a
high probability for containing cultural material
based on the results of previous investigations in
the area as well as the history of landscape
modification (Figure 4). Field investigation
targeted all predetermined geophysical and
geotechnical borehole locations (n=47) within the
1,000-acre tract, with additional systematic
pedestrian
inspection
and
subsurface
investigations within 163 acres covering eolian
lomas,
which
strongly
correlate
with
archaeological site distribution patterns in the area.
Archaeologists examined the ground surface and
erosional profiles and exposures for cultural
resources. For areal projects, the Texas Historical
Commissionâs (THCâs) survey standards require a
minimum of one shovel test per 3 acres for
projects greater than 100 acres in size, dependent
on variables such as surface visibility, disturbance,
and soils. Based on the size of the area determined
to have a high probability of containing cultural
material, 54 shovel tests were required; some of
which coincide with the locations of the
geotechnical and geophysical borehole locations
specified by NextDecade. Many of the borehole
locations, however, are located across the tidal
flats and/or dredge spoils, but shovel tests were

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background literature review identified three
previously recorded sites within the 1,000-acre
Project area, and an additional five sites within a
0.5-mile radius (see Figure 4). The three sites
within the Project area (41CF8, 41CF135, and
41CF191) are prehistoric or historic Native
American sites. The background review also
identified one previous intensive cultural resources
survey area that overlaps a small part of the
current Project area.
In 2004, Coastal Environments, Inc. conducted
surveys of select high probability areas along SH
48 on behalf of TxDOT. The survey covered a
very minor portion (less than 1 acre) of the
northwest corner of the Project area as well as a
small area in the northeastern corner of the APE.
The informal surveys include site documentation
by Curtis Tunnel with the THC in 1969, and a
survey by avocational archaeologist C. K.
Chandler with the Texas Archeological Society in
1974. The sites recorded in these efforts are
discussed as follows.

In addition to the sites recorded within the Project
area, five sites and a shipwreck are recorded
within 0.5 mile. Sites 41CF18, 41CF19, and
41CF100 are all located on Loma Ochoa on the
southern side of the ship channel. 41CF18 is a
Confederate camp, and the other two sites are
small prehistoric sites. Site 41CF49 is a faunal
scatter. Finally, 41CF190 is on the northern side of
SH 48 near the northwestern corner of the Project
area. Like the adjacent site (41CF191) within the
Project area, 41CF190 is a cluster of shells
possibly associated with human occupation, along
with a flaked Rangia cuneata valve (Weinstein et
al. 2005). The shipwreck Pt. Brownsville is about
0.5 mile southeast of the Project area along the
southern side of the ship channel. The OTHM for
the Port of Brownsville, located approximately 10
miles southwest of the Project area,
commemorates the construction of the BSC
beginning in 1934 and Port dedication in 1936
(Atlas 2015).

Recorded in 1969 by Curtis Tunnell and H. P.
Jensen, the Garcia Pasture site (41CF8) was
documented as a heavily eroded and looted
historical Indian camp and burial ground. An
informant reported of several small triangular
glass arrow points, as well as one of shell and
another of brass. The locational information is
vague, and consequently a large area is recorded in
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) site files. The southwestern margin of the
site overlaps the Project area. The site was listed in
1972 as a National Register District. Its period of
significance ranges from A.D. 1000 to 1749 and is
associated with the Brownsville complex, Barril
complex, and historic phases.
Site 41CF135, recorded by C. K. Chandler in
1974, is designated the Channel Spill site, and is
within an area mapped as dredge material.
Thousands of disarticulated Rangia cuneata
valves, one bifacial perforator, two Matamoros
and one Abasolo dart points, and lithic debitage
were noted on the site. Kumpe et al. (1998) state
that there is no clear association between the
cultural material and the shell and that the cultural
material is presumed to have been deeply buried
before the material was dredged and dumped in its
current location. No recommendations on
eligibility or significance are provided on the site
form (Atlas 2015).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps
determined there are no historic-age structures
within or adjacent to the APE (Foster et al. 2006).
Furthermore, a review of historic topographic
maps and aerial photography did not identify any
historic-age structures within the Project area. The
review did, however, identify land ownership of
the Project area for different years.

Site 41CF191, located near the northern margin of
the southwestern end of the APE, was recorded as
a possible minor aboriginal occupation on the
unnamed Puerta de Trancas âloma islandâ south of
SH 48 (Weinstein et al. 2005). Coastal
Environments, Inc. recorded the site in 2004 as
part of the above-mentioned survey of SH 48
(Weinstein et al. 2005). The investigations
identified âa cluster of numerous half-naked pen
shells mixed with a few oystersâ that is likely of
natural origin but possibly cultural (Weinstein et
al. 2005). No cultural material was documented by
Coastal Environments Inc., however, one flaked
Rangia cuneata valve was reportedly found by an
avocational archaeologist immediately north of SH
48 (41CF190) at which time a small unifacial
scraper was found in the 41CF191 area (Weinstein
et al. 2005:55â56). No recommendations
regarding the siteâs SAL or NRHP eligibility or
significance are provided.

The earliest maps reviewed of the Project area are
an 1867 H. Holtz map of Texas and an 1853 map
of the U.S.-Mexico Border for Guadalupe and
Hidalgo. These maps illustrate a single trail
intersecting the western portion of the Project
from the southeast to the northwest. This trail is a
part of a network of trails that cover the state of
Texas and parts of Mexico. The eastern portion of
the Project area is illustrated as entering Laguna
De La Madre, or Laguna Madre, and resting on
Isla del Padre. A later 1911 P. Krober Map of the
Rio Grande Frontier also depicts the Project area
as within the same setting (Foster et al. 2006).
Three maps of Cameron County from 1873, 1880,
and 1884 depict land grants within the Project
area. The 1873 E. Schutze map identifies the
eastern portion of the Project area as land grant

survey of select portions of the Rio Grande LNG
Project APE. Access was unrestricted for the
1,000-acre tract, where standing water and dense
vegetation presented the only limitations, but these
areas were nevertheless surveyed and shovel tested
(Figures 7 and 8). Investigators first covered the
Project area by completing investigation of the 47
predetermined borehole locations, which were
spread across the tract. Additional pedestrian
inspection and shovel testing was then conducted
on all lomas and previously documented sites
within the area (Figure 9).

1.418 Heirs of Rafael Garcia, also known as
âPotrero de la Santa Isabel.â The eastern portion
of the Project area covers Laguna Madre and
Padre Island. The 1880 General Land Office map
shows the western half of the Project area within
the Potrero de la Santa Isabel, and the eastern half
with Laguna Madre waters and Padre Island. The
1884 J.J. Cocke map places the western portion of
the Project area within the Rafael Garcia land
grant, known as Santa Isabel. The eastern portion
of the Project area crosses Laguna Madre onto
Padre Island, which is marked as Spanish land
(Foster et al. 2006).

The field investigations encountered several
distinct microenvironments within the 1,000-acre
tract, which are specific to the various landforms
present. The most common setting within the
Project area is that of the low-lying tidal flats.
These areas exhibit little to no topographic relief
and have relatively dense, leafy wetland
vegetation with scattered mesquite trees and cacti.
Ground surface visibility across the flats was
typically around 30 percent. As previously noted,
a large percentage of the low flats were inundated
at the time of survey (see Figure 7 and Figure 10).
Typical soils encountered within the tidal flats
consist of brown to dark grayish brown clay with
soft calcium carbonate nodules. Shovel tests in
tidal areas were typically terminated at the water
table or as a result of thick, sticky and saturated
clay (Appendix A).

According to the Port of Brownsville Historical
Marker text (Atlas 2015), dredging of the BSC
began in 1934 and the port was officially opened
in 1936. A review of the Laguna Vista 1929 and
1936, Port Isabel 1929 and 1934, and Brownsville
1953 and 1962 U.S. Geological Survey
topographic maps indicates that prior to the
dredging of the BSC and the construction of SH
48 (initially constructed in 1952 [Weinstein et al.
2005]), the southwestern half of the APE
(southwest of Loma del Rincon Chiquito) was
mapped as water within the mouth of the Laguna
Madre (Figure 5). As such, all portions of the
Project area southwest of Loma del Rincon
Chiquito that are currently elevated above the tidal
flats are manmade, as a result of modern
construction activity, with the exception of a small
loma island that is bisected by SH 48.
Modification within the northeastern half of the
Project area includes northeastern extension of the
barrier island from the southeastern edge of Loma
del Rincon Chiquito into Paso Corvinas. The
earliest available aerial imagery for the Project
area (1950) serves to illustrate the extensive
disturbance within the Project area (Figure 6).
Tidal flats and artificial landforms composed of
dredge have a low to negligible potential for intact
cultural resources.

Along the BSC, channel dredging has resulted in
an accumulation of mottled, clayey spoils (Figure
11). Vegetation is absent along the majority of the
BSC and there is a consistent presence of historic
to modern glass, ceramic, metal, and plastic as
well as oyster and clam shells scattered across the
surface of the spoils (Figure 12). As this mix of
natural and cultural material is a result of dredging
and accumulated storm debris, it was not
documented as an archaeological site. Shovel tests
excavated within the mapped areas of dredge
spoils typically encountered heavily mottled
brown and dark grayish brown clay with
occasional calcium carbonate filaments (Appendix
A).

such, ground surface visibility on the lomas
averaged around 20 to 30 percent at the time of
survey. Soil encountered on the lomas is typically
brown sandy clay loam over light grayish brown,
compact clay loam with calcium carbonate
concretions and filaments (Appendix A).

Other microenvironments within the Project area
consist of the eroded edges of loma formations and
the vegetated ridges. As with the dredge spoils,
little to no vegetation is present on the sloping
edges of the lomas, affording nearly 100 percent
ground surface visibility where wind and water
erosion has exposed stratified layers of soil
(Figures 13 and 14). The erosional exposures were
examined and no cultural material or potential
cultural features were observed. The loma ridges
on the other hand, are largely covered in an
extremely dense thicket of thorny south Texas
vegetation consisting of mesquite, agarita, acacia,
catclaw, lantana, prickly pear cacti, and Spanish
dagger. Despite dense vegetation, investigators
were able to survey and shovel test atop the lomas,
utilizing often abundant exposures on the margins
of the landforms (see Figure 13). Vegetation
across the less dense portions of the lomas consists
of sawgrass, mesquite, and cacti (Figure 15). As

Within the 1,000-acre Project area, a total of 163
acres were identified as having a high probability
for containing cultural material. The remaining
acreage consists of low-lying tidal flats and/or
dredge spoils from the BSC. As mentioned, many
of the low-lying areas were inundated at the time
of survey. Based on these factors, total of 144
shovel tests were excavated in support of the
Project (Appendix A). This excavation interval
exceeds THC/Council of Texas Archeologists
Minimum Survey Standards for an area measuring
163 acres in size, which recommends one shovel
test per 3 acres for project areas larger than 100
acres.

Only one of the 144 excavated shovel tests was
positive for cultural material; on site 41CF8 in the
northern portion of the Project area on Loma del
Mesquite (see Figure 9). An additional 60 shovel
tests were excavated on site 41CF8, all of which
were negative for cultural material. Sites 41CF135
and 41CF191 were also revisited, however, no
additional shovel tests were positive for cultural
material and no new sites were documented within
the Project area. Overall, three previously recorded
sites were revisited (41CF8, 41CF135, and
41CF191) and one prehistoric isolated find (IF)
was documented during the course of the Rio
Grande LNG Project investigations (Appendix A;
see Figure 9).
SITE 41CF8
As discussed, site 41CF8 is a prehistoric and
historic Native American site initially recorded in
1969 by Curtis Tunnell and H. P. Jensen (Atlas
2015). This site is located within, and to the north
of, the APE on Loma del Mesquite, (see Figure 9).
An informant reported of several small triangular
glass arrow points, as well as one of shell and
another of brass. The siteâs period of significance

loma within the Project area. The single burned
rock fragment is an approximately 3-cm by 0.5-cm
spherical cap caused as a result of heat exposure
(i.e., heat spall or pot lid). Based on the relative
absence of naturally occurring rock in the area, it
is presumed that this fragment is a cultural artifact;
encountered in shovel test MC19 at a depth of 40
cm below surface (cmbs) (see Appendix A).

ranges from A.D. 1000 to 1749 and is associated
with the Brownsville complex, Barril complex,
and historic phases. No subsurface testing is
documented; however, records indicate the
potential for cultural material to a depth of 1 meter
(m).
The site was listed in 1972 as a National Register
District (No. 72001355). The locational
information presented in the 1969 sketch map
indicates two discrete areas of significance on the
loma that are beyond the limits of the current
Project area. However, a large rectangular site
boundary measuring approximately 1,400 m northsouth by 1,000 m east-west is currently recorded
in the TARL site files (see Figure 4) (Atlas 2015).
The individual areas (Areas 1 and 2) mapped by
Tunnell and Jensen are depicted in a Coastal
Environments, Inc. report of investigations
conducted along SH 48 (Weinstein et al. 2005),
and it is currently unclear how, when, and why the
boundary was modified to its current extent.

A total of 61 shovel tests (LA15â24, MC15â26,
MG19â32, MS12â21, and SS18â32) were
excavated on site 41CF8, and all (n=60) aside
from MC19 were negative for cultural material.
Shovel tests were first scattered across the site in
order to identify any concentrations of cultural
material, and in the absence of such, were then
excavated at 5-m intervals along each cleared
seismic survey corridor beginning at the northern
Project area boundary (Figure 19). Soils
encountered within the majority of shovel tests
consist of yellowish brown or grayish brown
sandy clay loam over compact grayish brown
sandy clay with 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate
filaments (Figure 20). The soil transition typically
occurs between 40 to 50 cmbs and shovel tests
were terminated due to compact and sterile subsoil
at a depth of 60 to 80 cmbs. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
encountered.

Vegetation varies from short, patchy grass on the
south edge of the loma (Figure 16) to a dense
thicket of mesquite, acacia, agarita, yucca and
other thorny south Texas scrub brush across the
top of the loma (Figure 17). A grid of seismic
survey corridors was previously cleared across the
site, extending to the north, which provided
investigators open corridors to traverse the site and
inspect the ground surface (Figure 18).
Approximately 10 to 70 percent of the ground
surface was visible within the northern and
southern halves of the site within the APE,
respectively.

SUMMARY
Site 41CF8 is a historical Indian camp and burial
ground initially documented in 1969 and listed as
a National Register District in 1972 (Atlas 2015).
The significant portion of the site was reported to
contain human burials as well as glass, shell, and
brass arrow points eroding out of the ground
surface. This portion of the site, however, is to the
north of the current APE. The larger, 1,400,000 m2
National Register District boundary extends into
the Project area. Accordingly, the area was subject
to intensive pedestrian inspection and subsurface
testing at a 5-m interval in order to capture any
southern extension of the site.

Cultural material encountered on the site were
limited to a few fragments of oyster and common
rangia (clam) shell fragments and one limestone
heat spall. The shell fragments were present on the
ground surface and those plotted with the GPS
exhibited evidence of burning (see Figure 18). No
other cultural material was observed through
inspection of the ground surface, including
intensive inspection of the eroded edges of the

the significance of all cultural material in those
areas. The investigated portion of the site is not
recommended as a contributing element to the
siteâs NRHP listing or for listing as a SAL.
41CF135
Site 41CF135, recorded by C. K. Chandler in 1974
is a scatter of prehistoric artifacts located within
dredge spoils near the edge of the BSC (Figure 21)
(Atlas 2015; Kumpe et al. 1998). Thousands of
disarticulated Rangia cuneata valves, one bifacial
perforator, two Matamoros and one Abasolo dart
points, and lithic debitage were noted on the site.
The cultural artifacts are part of an avocational
archaeologistâs collection (Kumpe et al. 1998).
Kumpe et al. (1998) states that there is no clear
association between the cultural material and the
shell and that the cultural material is presumed to
have been deeply buried before the material was

Based on the results of the current investigation,
the portion of site 41CF8 within the Rio Grande
LNG Project area does not exhibit the potential to
contribute to the siteâs overall NRHP significance.
As such, no additional investigation is
recommended for the portion of site 41CF8 within
the current APE. Investigation of the remaining
portions of Loma del Mesquite beyond the current
Project boundary, however, may yield additional
information important to regional prehistory. If
future impacts are proposed to any portion of the
site beyond the current Project area, additional
investigation is recommended to adequately assess

dredged and dumped in its current location. No
recommendations on eligibility or significance are
provided on the site form (Atlas 2015).

SUMMARY
Site 41CF135 is a scatter of prehistoric debitage
and tools initially documented in 1974 within the
BSC dredge spoils (Atlas 2015). Kumpe et al.
reported the site to be in a secondary context and
there are no recommendations regarding the SAL
or NRHP eligibility further investigation (Atlas
2015; Kumpe et al. 1998). SWCA documented an
extensive scatter of historic through modern debris
along the edge of the BSC, including the site area,
but did not observe any prehistoric material
despite abundant surface visibility. As reported,
the prehistoric artifacts found in the area are part
of a private collection (Kumpe et al. 1998) and are
no longer present. SWCA recommends that site
41CF135 is not eligible for the NRHP or
designation as an SAL based on a lack of
contextual integrity and the absence of cultural
material at the time of survey. Accordingly, no
additional work is recommended for site 41CF135.

The mapped area of site 41CF135 is barren, with
no vegetation across the dredge spoils (Figure 22).
As such, 100 percent of the ground surface is
visible and has been so since the BSC was initially
dredged, based on a review of 1950â2015 aerial
imagery (see Figure 6). No prehistoric cultural
material was observed within the site boundary
during the recent investigation. The site area, as
well as the majority of the dredge spoils surface, is
covered in marine shell and historic through
modern debris; including glass, ceramic, metal,
and plastic items. A total of four shovel tests were
excavated within the site boundary (LA07, MC08,
MG10, and MG11) and all were negative for
cultural material (Appendix A). Soils encountered
within these shovel tests typically consists of
mottled yellowish brown to very dark grayish
brown sandy clay loam. Shovel tests were
terminated at a depth of 25 to 55 cmbs due to the
water table or evidence of disturbed soils.

(Appendix A). As all tests were negative for
cultural material and no site dimensions were
previously specified, the extent of the loma south
of SH 48 is assumed to be the maximum extent of
the site (125 m northwest-southeast by 90 m
northeast-southwest)

41CF191
Site 41CF191 was recorded as a possible minor
aboriginal occupation on the unnamed Puerta de
Trancas âloma islandâ at the southern end of the
Project area, south of SH 48 (Weinstein et al.
2005). Coastal Environments Inc. identified âa
cluster of numerous half-naked pen shells mixed
with a few oystersâ (Weinstein et al. 2005). The
report defines the site as consisting of 10 or more
Atrina seminuda (half-naked pen) and five or more
Crassostrea virginica (oyster) shells or fragments.
No cultural material was documented; however,
the report mentions an avocational archaeologist
found one flaked Rangia cuneata valve and a
unifacial scraper were reported by on the north
(41CF190) and south (41CF191) ends of the loma,
respectively. Based on these reported findings,
Coastal Environments, Inc. excavated 17 backhoe
trenches on the loma, north of SH 48 and did not
encounter any cultural material or signs of
aboriginal activity (Weinstein et al. 2005:56). No
recommendations on the siteâs SAL or NRHP
eligibility or significance are provided, and the site
location is recorded as a single isolated point
where the shell cluster occurred (Figure 23).

A roughly 2-m-diameter cluster of marine shell
was noted on the southern edge of the loma that,
based on the location, may be a portion of the
same
scatter
documented
by
Coastal
Environments, Inc. (Figures 25 and 26) (Weinstein
et al. 2005). No cultural material is associated with
the shell. As depicted in Coastal Environmentsâ
report, when initially documented, the small
cluster was in a heavily eroded area. Continued
erosion over the last decade may have destroyed
much of the feature, leaving only slight vestiges
observed during the Project survey.
SUMMARY
Site 41CF191 consists of a scatter of marine shells
in an area of reported cultural artifacts (Weinstein
et al. 2005). No artifacts were encountered during
the
2004
Coastal
Environments,
Inc.
investigations, which included 17 backhoe
trenches on the north side of SH 48 (Weinstein et
al. 2005), nor were artifacts encountered during
SWCAâs recent investigation. A total of five shovel
tests were excavated in support of the current
Project, all of which were negative for cultural
material. Thorough surface inspection of all
horizontal and vertical exposures failed to reveal
any signs of cultural activity. SWCA recommends
that site 41CF191 does not have the potential to
contribute significant data regarding regional
prehistory and history, and as such, is not
recommended as eligible for SAL or NRHP
inclusion. Accordingly, no further work is
recommended for site 41CF191.

Vegetation is relatively dense across the top of the
loma, consisting of tall grass, mesquite trees, and
Spanish dagger. Less than 10 percent of the
ground surface is visible atop the loma, in contrast
to the eroded edges and steeply sloping sides that
are completely exposed (Figure 24). No
prehistoric or historic cultural material was
observed in the site area and a total of five shovel
tests (LA01, MC01, MC02, MG01, and SS01)
were excavated on the loma (see Figure 23). All of
these tests were negative for cultural material.
Shovel tests encountered yellowish to grayish
brown sandy clay loam and were terminated
between 40 to 80 cmbs due to compact soil

highly eroded and precarious nature of the small cluster of shell when originally
recorded in September 2004 as 41CF191. The revisit during April 2015 Project
survey suggests the site has largely eroded away.

ISOLATED FINDS
A single IF (IF-MS01) documented during the
investigations is a fragment of coarse sandstone,
encountered on the ground surface among the
dredge spoils and debris along the BSC (Figure
27). The fragment exhibits one possibly ground
and concave surface and has maximum
dimensions of roughly 9 cm long by 2 cm wide.
Although the piece is highly fragmented and its
form and function are unclear, it is likely of
cultural origin based on the relative absence of
naturally occurring rocks in the area. No
vegetation is present and intensive pedestrian
inspection failed to identify any additional
prehistoric artifacts.

scatter of prehistoric tools and debitage identified
within the dredge spoils along with thousands of
Rangia and oyster shells (Kumpe et al. 1998). Site
41CF191 consists of a 2-m concentration of halfnaked pen shells and a single unifacial scraper
reported by an avocational archaeologist
(Weinstein et al. 2005).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In April 2015, SWCA conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the 1,000-acre Rio
Grande LNG Export Terminal Project area.
Because the Project will occur on land owned by
the Port of Brownsville (a political subdivision of
Texas), cultural resources investigations were
therefore conducted to comply with the ACT
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7249.
Additionally, the Project is anticipated to require
permits issued by the FERC and the USACE.
Accordingly, the proposed scope of work is also
intended to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA
(16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations
(36 CFR 800).

In addition to the three sites recorded within the
Project area, five sites and a shipwreck are
recorded within 0.5 mile. Sites 41CF18, 41CF19,
and 41CF100 are all located on Loma Ochoa on
the southern side of the ship channel. 41CF18 is a
Confederate camp, and the other two sites are
small prehistoric sites. Site 41CF49 is a faunal
scatter. Finally, 41CF190 is on the northern side of
SH 48 near the northwestern corner of the Project
area. Like the adjacent site (41CF191) located
within the Project area, 41CF190 is a cluster of
shells possibly associated with human occupation
of the area, along with a flaked Rangia cuneata
valve (Weinstein et al. 2005). The shipwreck Pt.
Brownsville is about 0.5 mile southeast of the
Project area along the southern side of the ship
channel. The historic map review determined there
are no historic-age structures within or adjacent to
the APE and that the area has been subject to
extensive modification since dredging of the BSC
began in 1934.

A review of historic maps, aerials, and other
information showing the history of land use
revealed substantial modifications to the
landforms in the Project area. Approximately 830
acres consist of either extant water bodies and tidal
flats or infilled shallow bays covered in spoil piles
from construction of the adjacent ship channel in
the 1930s and in subsequent modifications or
maintenance over the years. These areas have a
low potential for intact archaeological deposits
(Figure 28).
The background review identified one previous
intensive survey area and two informal surveys
covered portions of the APE, resulting in three
previously
recorded
archaeological
sites
documented within the Project area. The three
sites within the Project area include 41CF8,
41CF135, and 41CF191, all prehistoric or historic
Native American sites. Site 41CF8, the Garcia
Pasture site, is listed on the NRHP as a heavily
eroded and looted historical Indian camp and
burial ground. An informant reported of several
small triangular glass arrow points, as well as one
of shell and another of brass. Site 41CF135 is a

During the cultural resources survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined the entire 1,000-acre tract
with specific focus on the 47 geotechnical and
geophysical borehole locations predetermined by
NextDecade, previously recorded archaeological
sites, and loma formations identified as having a
high probability to contain cultural material. A
total of 144 shovel tests were excavated during the
recent investigations, one of which was positive
for cultural material on site 41CF8 (Appendix A).
This shovel test contained one burned rock
fragment at a depth of 40 cmbs.

such, the areas likely to contain intact cultural
material were limited to the lomas, or 163 acres
within the 1,000-acre Project area. These were,
therefore, investigated in accordance with the
ACT and 36 CFR 800.4 of the NHPA. However,
no new archaeological sites were recorded.

As site 41CF8 is listed on the NRHP as an
historical Indian camp and burial site, 61 shovel
tests were excavated to thoroughly document the
extent and significance of any portion of the site
within the Project area. These shovels tests were
concentrated in areas with lower surface visibility
compared to the exposed portions of the landform
on the southern and western portions of the site.
Cultural material identified within the site area
was limited to the single burned rock fragment
within shovel test MC19 and oyster shell
fragments scattered across the ground surface.
Shovel tests were excavated at 5-m intervals
within previously cleared seismic survey corridors,
running perpendicular to the Project boundary,
however, the results indicate that no significant
portion of the site extends into this area. Based on
the results of the current investigation, the portion
of site 41CF8 within the Rio Grande LNG Project
area does not contribute to the siteâs overall NRHP
significance. As such, no additional investigation
is recommended for the portion of site 41CF8
within the current Project area. If future impacts
are proposed to any portion of the site to the north
beyond the current Project area, additional
investigation is recommended as necessary to
adequately assess the significance of all cultural
material in those areas. The investigated portion of
the site is not recommended as eligible for listing
as an SAL.

SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resources within the
Project area. No archaeological sites that meet the
criteria for listing as an SAL or inclusion to the
NRHP were encountered during the cultural
resources investigations. SWCA recommends
therefore, that no further work is necessary within
the proposed 1,000-acre Rio Grande LNG Export
Terminal tract.

Despite abundant surface visibility, no cultural
material was encountered in the locations of sites
41CF135 and 41CF191. Site 41CF135 was
reported in an entirely disturbed secondary context
and 41CF191 was documented as a possible
cultural site despite the absence of cultural
material. Based on the negative results of SWCAâs
investigations of these areas, neither site is
recommended as eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or designation as a SAL or and;
accordingly, no further investigation is
recommended for either locale.
In general, the Project area has been heavily
impacted by previous disturbances including
dredging of the BSC and SH 48 construction. The
natural setting and disturbances within the survey
area have reduced the potential for encountering
intact cultural resources, as impacts have altered
the surface and subsurface of the landscape. As
