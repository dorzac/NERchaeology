ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed Plantation South project in
central Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) on July 13, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5697 for the City of
Conroe. The new road will be 1665 feet long and 62 feet wide (2.4 acres). No
archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were collected. Copies of the
report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, the Texas State Library, City of Conroe, and BVRA.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The City of Conroe plans to construct a new road to be named Plantation
Drive in the city limits of Conroe, Texas as Phase II of the Plantation Drive and
Drennan Road Project (Figure 1). When finished, the road will extend from the
intersection of newly constructed Drennan Road East and Drennan Road West
and extend south to West Cartwright Road (Loop 336). The proposed road will
be 1665 feet in length and 62 feet in width, and it will consist of four lanes with a
median. A portion of Plantation Drive (about 475 feet) north of West Cartwright
Road has been completed. Therefore, the area surveyed for this project was
approximately 1190 feet in length. According to the Conroe topographic
quadrangle (3095-132) dated 1958 and photorevised in 1976, there was a large
pond that covered about 450 to 500 feet of the area starting at North Frazier
Street and extending to the north (Figure 2). At the time of this survey, the pond
had been replaced with a segment of the road (as mentioned above), parking
lots, and commercial businesses. This is depicted on an aerial photograph dated
2005 (Figure 3).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is the City of Conroe, and
BVRA was retained to perform the archaeological survey. William E. Moore was
the Principal Investigator. Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist, and
he was assisted in the field by Phillip C. Bishop. The field survey involved sixteen
person hours and was performed on July 13, 2010. The reviewing agency is the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and prior archaeological surveys and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Montgomery County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Those reports reviewed include
work in the San Jacinto River Basin by Harry J. Shafer (1968) and a 450-acre tract
in Harris and Montgomery counties conducted by BVRA (1991). The project area
was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel testing. Shovel tests
were dug to sterile clay. Excavated earth from the tests was screened using ¼ inch
hardware cloth. Shovel test data were entered onto a log (Appendix I), and the
project was documented through field notes and digital photography. Eight shovel
tests were excavated (Figure 4).

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
previously recorded prehistoric sites had been recorded in close proximity to the
project area. Also, there is no evidence that the area has been surveyed or visited
by a professional archaeologist. In the southern portion of the project area, about
475 feet of Plantation Drive had been constructed and a parking lot and strip mall
was present. North of this point, the area disturbance consisted of old earth-moving
projects such as ponds, push piles, and large concrete drainpipes (Figure 5) that
had been buried. This area was thickly wooded. Soils in the area consisted of
sandy loam or sand over clay in six of the eight shovel tests. In the area of the first
two shovel tests, clay was present at the surface and they were terminated at 10
and 15 cm below the ground surface. No archaeological sites were found, and it is
our opinion that the project area was not occupied in prehistoric times because of
the distance from the area to a perennial stream. The nearest such water source is
Stewarts Creek that is 8000 feet to the east.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
