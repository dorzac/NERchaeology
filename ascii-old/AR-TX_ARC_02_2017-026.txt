ABSTRACT
The City of Denison is planning to construct a 12,000-foot-long wastewater line
in Grayson County, Texas. The purpose of the project is to replace an existing
wastewater line with a new line in the floodplain of Iron Ore Creek. The new line
will be placed in an undisturbed corridor within the floodplain. Alan Plummer
Associates, Inc. contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to survey the entire
12,000-foot-long pipeline route, including trenching at up to eight locations along
the proposed route. ARC hypothesized that there would be high potential for
deeply buried prehistoric resources in the floodplain, as well as high potential for
encountering historic cultural resources as the proposed route crosses a minimum
of two historic railroad berms. ARC conducted fieldwork from March 20-22,
2017, during which a total of 26 shovel tests and seven trenches were excavated
and a total of 27.4 acres were surveyed. No prehistoric cultural resources were
discovered during the survey, but two historic railroad berms (41GS251 and
41GS252) were recorded. ARC recommends that both sites are ineligible for
NRHP or SAL listing and that no further cultural resource investigations are
necessary for this project. ARC requests that the Texas Historical Commission
concur with this recommendation. Project documents will be curated at the Center
for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Denison is planning to construct a 12,000-foot-long wastewater line in Grayson
County, Texas (Figure 1). The route extends from the south side of the TX-503 Spur between
US-75 and SH-91 east across SH-91 and southeast ending at the existing Iron Ore Lift Station.
The entirety of the proposed line is routed through the Iron Ore Creek floodplain. The proposed
line will be replacing an existing line, but will be constructed outside the easement of the old
line. Much of the line will be placed within open-cut trenches that will have impact depths
between 5 and 15 feet. They will bore underneath SH91 and the active Burlington Northern
Santa Fe railroad. Alan Plummer Associates, Inc., who are handling the design of the project,
contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct intensive pedestrian survey of the route,
including trenching.
The cultural resource investigation was required by the Texas Antiquities Code because the City
of Denison is a political entity of the state. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7943 was issued for
the archaeological survey. Relevant legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission will review this report on behalf of the State. Relevant federal legislation includes
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources are present along
the pipeline route and to make recommendations about their significance and how they might be
impacted by construction. Survey was conducted by Allen Rutherford, Joy Tatem, and Joanna
Suckling from March 20th to the 22nd, 2017. A total of 26 shovel tests and seven trenches were
excavated during the survey. An additional eighth trench could not be excavated due to lack of
accessibility.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and
previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology
employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report
concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE IRON ORE INTERCEPTOR PIPELINE

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Iron Ore Interceptor pipeline route is located in the Northern Post Oak Savanna ecoregion of
Texas (Griffith et al. 2007:40-41). Historically, this region has been comprised of generally level
and gently rolling plains with post oak woodlands and prairie grasses. The vegetation of the
study area has been included as part of the Cross Timbers vegetation region, a transitional area
between the once prairie, now agricultural areas to the west, and the forested hills of eastern
Oklahoma and Texas (Texas A&M Forest Service 2014). The route is underlain by the
Cretaceous-aged Woodbine Formation, composed of beds of sand, clay, sandstone, and shale
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The pipeline route is mapped from east to west on the
northern floodplain of Iron Ore Creek, a perennial stream that flows southeast to Choctaw Creek,
a tributary of the Red River. The Red River itself is located approximately 10 mi east of the
easternmost extension of the pipeline route. Lake Texoma lies approximately 7 mi to the north of
the project area. Distances of the proposed route from Iron Ore Creek range from directly on the
creek banks to approximately 200 m north and the pipeline route will cross five intermittent
drainages.
The length of the proposed pipeline route is mapped on Bunyan and Whitesboro soils that are
frequently flooded (Cochran 1980). Bunyan soils consist of very deep, well drained, moderately
permeable sandy clay loams with an A horizon of light brownish gray fine sandy loam (0-25 cm)
that transitions to very dark grayish brown clay loam (25-40 cm) and grayish brown sandy clay
loam to gray clay loam subsoils (40-150 cm). Whitesboro soil series includes an A horizon (0-68
cm) of dark grayish brown loam and sandy clay loam underlain by a brown clay loam subsoil
(68-100 cm) and mixed gray and reddish yellow sandy clay loams (100-200 cm). The NRCS
does not provide soil information beyond 200 cmbs. Presumably the Bunyan and Whitesboro
soils are underlain by the Woodbine Formation, but that may not be the case in a floodplain
setting.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The archaeological literature lacks a definitive chronological framework for North Central
Texas. However, for the purposes of this report, a prehistoric chronology for North Central
Texas, based on Prikryl (1990) with an added historic period and a divided Late Prehistoric, is
presented below to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the cultural history of the
region (Table 1). Grayson County has received little archaeological investigation, although major
work was done in conjunction with the construction and subsequent raising and maintenance of
Lake Texoma. In 1941 and 1942, a Works Public Administration (WPA) sponsored team from
the University of Oklahoma carried out an archaeological survey of Bryan and Marshall counties
in Oklahoma. The subsequent survey of the Denison Dam area was done in a period of three
weeks, although it was noted that survey of the 146,000-acre lake area would have taken six
months to a year (Kelly n.d.). Kelly noted that sites decreased in number and significance as the
survey team moved westward from the dam site, and that the most important sites were near the
junction of the Red and the Washita rivers. The Lake Texoma reconnaissance recorded only four
archaeological sites. No major work was done in Texas because of this major construction
project until the lake level was to be raised in the early 1970s. At that time, the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project from The University of Texas at Austin (Prewitt and Larson
1972) recorded 158 archaeological sites.

Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points and radiocarbon dated site
deposits at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring
2001). These early people hunted now-extinct large game and foraged off the land. The earliest
occupation in Grayson County is attributed to the Paleo-Indian period based on the discovery of
Clovis and Folsom dart points (Bever and Meltzer 2007:68). These authors report only a single
Clovis point from Grayson County, but the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001) is located to the
southwest and was found in the bank of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Furthermore,
hundreds of Clovis points are reported to have been found in the channelized North Sulphur
River in Fannin County to the southeast (Bousman and Skinner 2007; Jennings 2005).
The subsequent Archaic occupation is not well documented, but is represented in archaeological
surveys (Ferring 1974; Skinner 2004) and reports from avocational archaeologists. Archaic
populations lived throughout North Central Texas, but particularly along the major and minor
stream valleys where they could hunt and gather foods and resources. Dart points, grinding
stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are artifacts commonly found at Archaic sites across the
state. The earliest Archaic populations continued making and using exotic cherts for dart points,

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE IRON ORE INTERCEPTOR PIPELINE

but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics, Uvalde Gravels, for chipped
stone tools. Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the
Trinity River and its various tributaries. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland
areas throughout the area. Although evidence of historic Native American occupation is known
in adjacent parts of Oklahoma as well as in East Texas and in the East Fork Watershed (Crook
and Hughston 2015), very little is known archaeologically about this time period in this
immediate part of North Central Texas (Skinner 1988).
Prikryl (1990) divides the Late Prehistoric into two phases for this region (at ca. 1200 A.D.)
based on projectile point types and changes in raw material frequencies. Late Prehistoric I is
generally represented by heat-treated quartzite and expanding-stemmed arrow points, such as
Scallorn and Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an
increase in buffalo bones in deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Late Prehistoric II saw an
increased use of chert, suggesting an increase of mobility or the expansion of trade networks.
During the Late Prehistoric, bison-hunting appears to have become the dominant subsistence
strategy. There is a marked Plains influence on lithic tool assemblages found in North Central
Texas dating to this period, with projectile points, scrapers, knives, and drills present here that
are seen throughout the Southern Plains (Prikryl 1990:80).
There is little evidence of protohistoric era Native American occupation in North Central Texas,
although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. Various Caddo
groups, including the Kichai, Ionis, and Tonkawa, were the earliest known inhabitants of what
later became Grayson County (Kumler 2010). At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there
appears to have been a general abandonment of the North Central Texas area based on an
absence of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish, or
English traders (Skinner 1988). This interpretation is tied to a perceived general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region.
Anglo-American settlers in the early 1800s were the first non-natives to settle in North Central
Texas. Though, beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, indigenous inhabitants
maintained a presence in the region. In 1846, Grayson County was created from Fannin County
and the town of Sherman was ultimately selected as the county (Kumler 2010). After the political
instability and economic depression of the Civil War and Reconstruction era, cattle herding and
developing river trade assisted in the regionâs recovery. By the 1870s and 1880s, settlement in
North Texas flourished and manufacturing and milling interests expanded to complement the
countyâs agricultural economic base. The city of Denison was established was established in
1872 with the presence of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas railroad and quickly gained a
reputation as a railroad town that was the gateway to the state of Texas (Grayson County Frontier
Village 1979:55).
Previous Investigations
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2017) located two archaeological sites recorded
along Iron Ore Creek, but no National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, or State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) within a 1-mi radius of the project area. One cemetery, the Iron

Ore Creek Cemetery, is located in the uplands approximately 0.7 mi to the southwest of the
western terminus of the pipeline route and dates to 1883-1922. Recorded sites in, or near, the
Iron Ore Creek floodplain include 41GS37 and 41GS124. These sites lie outside of a 1 mi radius
of the project area, but are included in this report as a possible indicator of what sites in the
project area may be like. 41GS37 was recorded approximately 1.6 mi west of the proposed
pipeline in 1973 by Moore and Keller Crawford. This site included flakes, a partial dart point,
and a possible hearth eroding out of a small, sandy hill south of the creek. 41GS124 is located
approximately 3.6 mi east of the proposed route and was recorded in 1994 by Robert Perales of
the TxDOT Environmental Affairs Division during a survey for the Iron Ore Creek CR 626
Bridge. This was a prehistoric open campsite where three test pits yielded 14 quartzite flakes 2050 cm below the surface. Another site that may be comparable due to a similarity in environment
is 41GS105, which lies approximately 5 miles to the southwest of the project area on a small
terrace remnant above Post Oak Creek. Post Oak Creek, like Iron Ore Creek, is part of the
Choctaw Creek watershed (Ferring 1974; Kumler 2010). Artifacts recovered from this site
included chipped stone and fire-cracked rock eroding from a knoll, which were relatively dated
to the Archaic period on the basis of an identifiable Gary point fragment (Ferring 1974).
Few archaeological surveys have been conducted within the 1 mi search radius of the project
area. Only one previous survey crossed Iron Ore Creek and the proposed pipeline route, which
was conducted by TxDOT in 1992 along Theresa Drive. No information is available on this
survey, other than that no sites were recorded. Other surveys in the area include a 2001 TxDOT
linear survey approximately 0.9 mi to the west, and a survey conducted in 2008 by ARC in 2008
for the proposed US 75 wastewater pipeline and lift stations (Todd 2008) over 1.3 mi to the
southwest. Overall, there is a dearth of archaeological survey in this area and much of Iron Ore
Creek has yet to be investigated for cultural resources.
The 1901 Denison and 1958 Sherman, TX 7.5â USGS topographic maps, the 1936 and 1961
general highway maps for Grayson County, and the 1909 Grayson County Soil Map were
examined to search for structures mapped within the project area. The 1901 and 1936 Denison
topographic and highway maps showed two historic railways crossing Iron Ore Creek as well as
several structures in the general vicinity. One structure was mapped along the proposed pipeline
route west of US 75 in 1936, but no longer appears by 1961. No structures are shown to be in the
right of way of the proposed pipeline by 1961, though several structures are mapped in the
general area. Current aerial photography confirms an absence of visible structures in the right of
way.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE IRON ORE INTERCEPTOR PIPELINE

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on research conducted prior to survey, two predictions were developed prior to survey
regarding the potential for finding prehistoric and historic sites. The first is that there is high
potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological sites within undisturbed floodplain settings.
Limited previous investigations in, or near, the Iron Ore Creek floodplain and similar geographic
settings have identified two prehistoric sites in terrace settings, but no extensive work has been
conducted in the floodplain itself. There may be remnant terraces within the Iron Ore Creek
floodplain that are unmapped or unidentified that may contain shallow or deeply buried
prehistoric sites. Sites likely to be identified in the current project area include possible
temporary camp sites buried under alluvium.
The second prediction addresses historic site potential which is considered high due to the
presence of historic railways and other structures visible on historic aerials and maps. Historic
trash scatters or isolated artifacts may be encountered, in part because of the project areaâs
proximity to roadways that have been mapped in the area for more than 50 years.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field
personnel walked the pipeline route within a 30-meter survey corridor where merited. Shovel
tests were placed every 100 m between trenches where ground visibility was less than 30-percent
and the ground surface was not heavily disturbed. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. A
backhoe with a 24-inch-wide bucket was used to excavate trenches in seven locations along the
proposed route within the Iron Ore Creek floodplain. An eighth trench was proposed in the
scope-of-work for this project, but could not be excavated due to accessibility issues. Trenches
were stepped to OSHA standards. All walls, floors, benches, and back dirt were examined for
cultural materials. Trench matrices were described based on composition, texture, and color
(Vogel 2002). Clay fill was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks to determine if
cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were described based on composition,
texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2010) was used to identify soil colors. The
authors made notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and any disturbed areas
where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel,
digital camera. Shovel test and project boundary locations were marked with a handheld Garmin
GPS map 64st receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into four sections. The first describes the project areaâs setting along with
results of the pedestrian survey. The second presents the results of the backhoe trenches. The
third describes the sites that were found during the survey. Conclusions derived from the survey
close the chapter. Shovel tests and trenches are described generally in the text and are detailed in
Tables 2 and 3.
Survey Results
The Iron Ore Interceptor pipeline project area is in a floodplain setting on the north side of Iron
Ore Creek. The vegetation in the area consists of lightly wooded riparian areas of pecan and bois
dâArc trees with invasive species, such as greenbrier, interspersed with areas of agriculturally
active pastures upland from the creek floodplain (Figure 2). Most of the pipeline route had a
ground visibility of 0 to 10 percent due to ankle-high grasses and leaves in wooded areas, with
some exceptions where sections were eroded or impacted by land use that were noted.

A total of 26 shovel tests were excavated along the pipeline route and are numbered and
described from west to east (Figure 3). Shovel tests 1-4 were excavated in lightly wooded areas
and had a general soil profile of dark brown clays atop very dark grayish brown clays and silty
clays. ST 1 had a 10 cm layer of dark yellowish brown silty sand above the clay. ST 3 and 4 soils
were heavily mottled (20-50%) with brown and strong brown clays throughout the profile. ST 5
consisted of 90 cm of black loamy clay. STs 6, 7, and 8 were excavated in pasture. ST 6 had a

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE IRON ORE INTERCEPTOR PIPELINE

soil profile of dark yellowish brown clay mottled with strong brown and very dark gray clays (060 cm) atop very dark gray clay mottled with dark reddish brown coarse sand. ST 7 had soils
comprised of 75 cm of black loamy clay atop reddish brown clay that was very compact towards
the bottom of the ST. ST 8 also had loamy clay atop compact clay, but with dark grayish brown
and dark gray clays.
Sections of the route east of ST 8 were skipped due to the proximity to Trench 3 and graded
highways. Excavation resumed at ST 9 in a maintained field south of an apartment complex just
east of the Texoma Parkway. This area appeared to be a recreational field and had modern
alterations present. The soil profile of ST 9 was disturbed, with 20 cm of very dark grayish
brown loamy clay mottled with strong brown clay atop 40 cm of strong brown compact clay
mottled with brown and gray clays. The soil contained pea to golf-ball sized gravels and was
terminated due to the presence of large ironstone cobbles that made excavating lower levels
impossible. STs 10 and 11 were also excavated in areas south of the apartment complex and
contained highly disturbed soils that consisted of 20 cm of very dark grayish brown loamy clay
mottled with strong brown loamy clay atop 40 cm of strong brown compact clay and sandy clays
mottled with brown and gray clays with substantial amounts of ironstone cobbles.
Moving away from the complex area, STs 12, 13, and 14 were excavated in a maintained pasture
that was part of a property behind a currently lived-in house. ST 12 had a mottled soil profile of
90 cm of very dark grayish brown clay mottled with strong brown coarse sand. ST 13 was
excavated just south of a small stock pond within view of the creek bank. The soil profile
consisted of 20 cm of brown compact sandy clay with ironstone atop light yellowish brown
sandy loam underlain by deep very dark grayish brown silty clay to at least 150 cm below
surface. ST 14 contained far more disturbed soils with 10 cm of dark grayish brown compact
clay loam underlain by strong brown compact sandy clay mottled with dark grayish brown sandy
clay and light brownish gray clay with substantial amounts of ironstone cobbles below 40 cm.
ST 15 was located along a two-track road in the woods and exposed very dark grayish brown
compact clay atop dark yellowish brown silty clay. ST 16 was also located in the light woods
dividing pastures, and had a soil profile of brown clay loam atop yellowish brown sand underlain
by deep, dark grayish brown clay. STs 17, 18, and 19 were located in a pasture with overgrown
grasses. ST 17 had 41 cm of brown and strong brown sandy loams atop dark gray clay. ST 18
had very dark grayish brown clay atop strong brown sandy clay with ironstone cobbles, whereas
ST 19 consisted of dark gray and dark grayish brown clays that extended to a depth of over 140
cm. ST 20 was excavated in light woods with a soil profile of 19 cm of dark brown compact clay
atop 100 cm of brown clay that contained snail shell and charcoal, though no artifacts.
Approximately 100 m east of ST 20, was a cleared area with two non-archaeological trenches
excavated (Figure 4) in the woods west of South Fannin Street. The western trench was dug next
to the remains of an asphalt road (Figure 5) and contained the remains of a telecommunications
cable, copious amounts of gravel, and shards of amber glass (Figure 6). No diagnostic artifacts
were apparent in this trench and no remaining standing structures, other than a modern fence,
were visible in the area. The second trench to the east contained no artifacts visible in the profile
or backfill. No artifacts were found on the ground surface. Due to the presence of the trenches
and a higher ground visibility, shovel testing was not deemed necessary.

ST 21 was excavated next to an inundated area north of the Iron Ore Creek bank (Figure 7). The
soil profile was comprised of 12 cm of dark brown compact clay atop strong brown silty clay
mottled with brownish yellow clay and ironstone underlain by strong brown silty clay at 62-80
cm. This shovel test was terminated due to reaching the water table. STs 22, 23, and 24 were
excavated in pasture and had a similar profile of 30 cm of highly disturbed soil with strong
brown sandy clay mottled with brown and red clays with substantial amounts of ironstone
cobbles. This was agriculturally active pastureland, which likely accounted for the disturbed soils
throughout (Figure 8). ST 25 could be excavated much deeper to over 100 cm with a soil profile
of 11 cm of very dark grayish brown compact clay mottled with dark yellowish brown clay
underlain by dark yellowish brown sandy clay loam atop disturbed yellowish brown sandy clay
mottled with dark brown sandy clay underlain by very dark brown, compact clay. ST 26 was
excavated near the creek bank, as furthest east along the pipeline route as could be reached, and
had a soil profile of 32 cm of dark yellowish brown sandy loam underlain by brown silty clay
taken to a depth of 70 cm before impenetrable roots prevented further excavation.

Trenches
A total of seven backhoe trenches (BHT) were excavated along the proposed pipeline route
(Figure 9). The trenches were excavated along the trajectory of the route to examine subsurface
deposits that will be impacted by pipeline construction. Each trench was five meters long and,
from the first bench to the sheer profile wall, 60 cm wide. Depth ranged from 150 cmbs to 380
cmbs. In general, trenches were placed within 100 ft. of a drainage with the exception of BHTs 2
and 7 which were placed in locations that were hypothesized to be possible older terraces within
the area mapped as the floodplain of Iron Ore Creek. Within individual trenches the profiles were
consistent. As such, one profile was recorded for each. The profiles exposed during trenching
were generally consistent with the Bunyan and Whitesboro soils that are mapped by the NRCS in
the Iron Ore Creek floodplain (Figure 10). The exceptions were in BHTs 6 and 7 which were
closer to matching Aubrey series soils which border the floodplain soils to the north and,
according to the NRCS, consist of brown fine sandy loam underlain by red and gray clays
(Figure 11). Ironstone was exposed in those trenches at relatively shallow depths and in BHT6
there was a very compact sand layer intermixed with sandy clay starting at 85 cmbs. The alluvial
deposition in the floodplain does not appear to be very complex or frequent. The possible
exception being BHT4. BHT4 was located on a small rise, possible terrace, less than 20 m north
of Iron Ore Creek. In zones 5 and 6 of that BHT there was some evidence of sand laminates
mixed within the sandy clay soil, but not defined enough to be considered discrete layers. These
might be evidence of flood events, but it is unclear. No paleosols were identified in the trenches
and no cultural materials were uncovered either.

Figure 11.

mark the zone boundaries. Photo taken facing south.

Site 41GS251
Site 41GS251 appears as âT&NOâ railroad on historic maps, which was most likely the Texas
and New Orleans Railroad that was later merged into the Southern Pacific Company (Figure 12).
This was an antebellum railroad chartered in 1856 and operated until 1961 (Williams 2010). This
part of the former railroad is currently located on private property. The site boundaries within the
proposed pipeline project area include a cleared corridor that otherwise holds no intact features
of the railroad (Figure 13 and Figure 14). No railroad ties or rails are visible in this area. Old
growth trees line the corridor and were used to define the area. The corridor is approximately 5
m wide. Remnants of the railway, including bridge abutments lining a drainage, were observed
50-70 m south of the proposed pipeline centerline, but lie outside of the project area and should
not be impacted by construction. A 34 m east/west by 8 m north/south portion of the berm is
located within the survey corridor but south of the proposed project centerline.
The site contains no diagnostic artifacts and consists of a segment of a historic railroad berm.
There is no potential for offering insights into regional history or past environment. 41GS251 is
not recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.

Site 41GS252
Site 41GS252 is mapped as the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad on historic maps, also known as
âthe Katy,â which was established in 1865 and decommissioned in 1988, though some of the
Texas lines were sold or decommissioned as early as 1923 (Hofsommer 2010). The railroad was
the first to enter Texas from the north and eventually connected Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
and Texas. The first railroad to cross what was then known as Indian Territory, the Katy attracted
investment interests from several historic figures, such as John D. Rockefeller, and was acquired
in 1880 by Jay Gould, the railroad magnate. By 1904, the system had over 1,000 miles of track in
Texas and carried passengers on well-known trains such as the âTexas Specialâ and âKaty Flyerâ
before passenger services ended in 1965 (Grayson County Frontier Village 1979:25). The Katy
operated 3,765 miles of track at its peak in 1970, and has been the subject of songs (Scheer
1991:62) and historic events, such as the Dalton Gang train robbery of the line at Leliaetta and
Adair, Oklahoma (Samuelson 2009).
While the berm area was documented, no intact features are present in the corridor within the
pipeline route project area (Figure 14). Remains of the railroad include substantial amounts of
gravel that was used for the track ballast that supported the wood ties of the track. Some wood
ties are present, but displaced (Figure 16). The area surrounding the pipeline centerline appeared
to have been bulldozed out at some point in the past, estimated at roughly 10-15 years ago, due
to the new growth trees in the area (Figure 17). The berm itself is lined by old growth trees

(estimated at 40-50 years old) and rises approximately 1.5 m above the ground surface to the
north of the pipeline route (Figure 18). The corridor of the rail line was roughly estimated (due to
the disturbance and vegetation) to be 5 m wide. Intact portions of the railroad, including a bridge,
are located south of the project area, but will not be impacted by the mapped pipeline route.
The site contains no diagnostic artifacts and consists of a segment of a historic railroad berm.
There is no potential for offering insights into regional history or past environment. 41GS252 is
not recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.

Conclusions
The results of the survey were largely negative, though two historic railroad berms were
recorded during the current investigation. These results are relatively in line with what was
expected. Prehistoric archaeology in floodplain environments in the part of Texas where the
project took place is a relative unknown. As such, trenches were excavated in order to determine
whether the Iron Ore Creek floodplain showed signs of a complex Holocene alluvial
environment and/or had potential for deeply buried prehistoric resources. Prehistoric potential
was high, but no older or remnant terraces of the creek that extended into the floodplain were
identified within the survey corridor and the project area is relatively near the headwaters of the
creek. Additionally, we found nothing archaeological that was useful for dating sediment
deposition, but the absence of paleosols in the floodplain might be indicative of relatively recent,
though not very complex in either frequency or depth, deposition. The Iron Ore Creek floodplain
may still hold potential for deeply buried deposits, but they were not revealed within the survey
corridor of the current project. As for historic cultural resources, a part of the abandoned T&NO
railroad berm and a berm associated with Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad are located within the
project ROW. The sites contained no diagnostic artifacts and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas berm is
heavily disturbed within the survey corridor.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE IRON ORE INTERCEPTOR PIPELINE

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
along the proposed Iron Ore Interceptor wastewater pipeline project in Grayson County, Texas.
Two historic sites (41GS251 and 41GS252) were recorded. These sites are not recommended as
eligible for listing on the NRHP nor to be designated as a SAL with the projectâs ROW.
41GS251 and 41GS252 are not recommended because only portions of the berms are left intact
and there are no associated artifacts or features of note. Additionally, the sites have little
potential for offering insights into regional history. AR Consultants, Inc. concludes that further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted within the proposed Iron Ore Interceptor project
area and recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this assessment.
However, if buried cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
