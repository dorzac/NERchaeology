The Museum of Underwater Archaeology (MUA) is pleased to announce that
"Holding History in Your Hand" classroom
learning kits are now ready for shipping world
wide. Due to the generous contributions of materials we can now offer these kits to classrooms
to keep for future use free of charge. We do require nominal shipping costs.* The kits include
modern artifacts similar to those found on many
historic shipwreck sites and supporting documents such as a lesson plan and artifact analysis
guides, videos to supplement class discussion,
book marks, word searches and more. Instructions for adapting the kit to various age groups
from 10 to 18 years are included. For further
information please see our updated brochure at:

Friends and colleagues: The Viking
Age in Iceland, heretofore known to us
primarily through the oral tradition as expressed in the Icelandic Sagas, now is
yielding up its secrets through the methods of archaeology. The cultural and environmental dynamics of the Conversion
Period, when Christianity became established, is the subject of A Viking Landscape: The Mosfell Archaeological Project, the latest video feature on our nonprofit streaming-media Web site, The Archaeology
Channel
(http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).

http://www.uri.edu/artsci/his/mua/documents/
muakit.pdf
The MUA staff has conducted the
"Holding History in Your Hand" exercise for
hundreds of school children with great success. We look forward to sharing this activity
which teaches students how underwater archaeologists learn about our past through material
culture.
Best regards,
T Kurt Knoerl, Director

This video describes the Mosfell
Archaeological Project, an interdisciplinary research project employing saga
studies, archaeology, physical anthropology, and environmental sciences. The
project's goal is to construct a picture of
human habitation and environmental
change in the Mosfell region of southwestern Iceland. Work at Kirkjuhll in
2002 revealed a conversion period
wooden stave church and a Christian
cemetery with skeletons. The Mosfell
Project contributes to the larger study of
Viking Age and later medieval Iceland.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment.
