TRANS-PECOS POTTERY TYPES

(NON-PUEBLOAN)
CONCHO$ RED-ON-BROWN
GENER/~L NOTES:
Little data available. Sherds indicate a thick, rather
crudely painted pottery with broad lines drawn in a
thin, dull red paint on a brownish-buff surface. It
has been found in extreme western Texas in the Rio
Grande valley and adjacent parts of Chihuahua. It
was made in late prehistoric and early historic times.

PUEBLOAN POTTERY TYPES OCCURRING
IN TEXAS*
As it has not been possible to assemble adequate illustrations of these types, most of which appear to have been
carried into Texas as trade pottery, the reader is referred to the following published references:

* The term "Puebloan" is here used in the broad sense, following
Erik K. Reed. It includes the Anasazi and Mogollon traditions,
to which we have added the comparable developments of the
Chihuahua culture.
