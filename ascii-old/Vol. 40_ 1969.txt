A Clovis Fluted Point From Hood County, Texas
8. ALAN SKINNER AND RANDLE RASH

In October of 1968, Scott James, a second grade student in Granbury, Texas, found a Clovis fluted point in a pile of gravel which had
been brought to his home from a gravel quarry located on the Brazos
River in Hood County. Being curious about this large projectile he
reported the find to Mr. Rash
who subsequently relayed the
information to the Anthropology
Research Center at Southern
Methodist University through
Mr. Charles A. Smith, Jr., then
secretary for the Texas Archeological Society.
The exact location of the
gravel wash is uncertain but it
was on the east side of the
Brazos River in the vicinity of
Granbury. The point appears to
have been manufactured from
locally available flint. In this
particular vicinity, flint occurs
as cobbles within bands of conglomerate which are present in
the Cretaceous age lfinestone
bluffs which border the river.
The point (Fig. 1) is made of
a tan to light gray mottled flint.
There is no evidence of stream
smoothing of the flake scars or
the edges. The tip, one corner of
the base, and a notch on the left
edge are recent and expose the
unpatinated gray flint in the
center of the point. Before the
Fic. 1. Clovis fluted point from Hood point was broken, Rash observed
that there was a finely chipped
County, Texas. Dots indicate the
extent of lateral grinding. Full size. notch present in the same location as the recent notch. The
broken length of the point is 113 ram., the maximum width is 36 ram.,
and the maximum thickness is 9 ram. The point weighs 53.8 grams.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Primary flaking was carried out in a transverse manner to prepare
the blank and is evidenced by the large sears on the upper three quarters of the body. The flake platforms were removed by subsequent
chipping.
Secondary chipping is generally in an oblique manner directed
toward the base from the lateral edges and usually does not extend
over half of the facial span. The point was retouched before the flutes
were removed. Ttnâee flakes were removed to create the flute on each
face and in all eases the fluting flakes end in a hinge fracture. The
lateral edges of the base are ground as indicated in the drawing. The
butt of the base may have been ground but this is uncertain due to
recent battering.
Although the point is not in a primary areheologieal context, it
lends further support to a long period of occupation within the area.
This find and recent work in the De Cordova Bend Reservoir area,
particularly by Blaine, HalTis, Crook and Shiner (1969) point to the
presence of groups of Paleo-Indian peoples at the end of the Pleistocene. We now have to begin looking for sites where we can test to
see just what life was like for these central Texas Paleo-Indians.

INTRODUCTION
In the four-state Caddoan Area a number of ceramic complexes
precede the earliest distinctive Caddoan ceramics. Sand-tempered
pottery, apparently the first ceramic along the Texas Coast (Wheat
1953, Ambler 1967, Aten 1967), appeared at least by 150 A.D., with
associated Tchefunete sherds. Inland in the Caddoan Area sandtempered pottery was reported from the McGee Bend Reservoir in
East Texas (Jelks 1965), in Southeastern Arkansas (Hoffman, personal communication 1965) and in variable but usually small amounts
from a number of other sites in East Texas, Northern Louisiana and
Southern Arkansas, on pre-Caddoan levels and generally preceding
clay-tempered wares.
Clay-tempered ceramics are first known in the Caddoan Area in
the Fourche Maline Focus of eastern Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis
1951: 19-9.7), immediately following non-pottery Archaic levels. On
a Hopewell-Marksville Woodland level clay-tempered pottery has
been reported in the Bellevue Focus of northwestern Louisiana (Fulton and Webb 1953), at the Coral Snake (MeClurkan, Field and
Woodall 1966) and Jonas Short (Jelks 1965) mound sites near the
Sabine River, from the Cooper Site in northeastern Oklahoma (Bell
and Baerreis 1951: 27-33) and the Kirkllam Site in north-central
Arkansas (Dickinson and Lemley 1939). Clay-tempered pottery was
dominant throughout Marksville, Coles Creek and Caddoan ceramics,
only being supplanted by shell tempering in the eastern part of the
Caddoan Area in late proto-historic times.
Bone-tempered pottery apparently was a Texas innovation. It
appeared on the coast and in East Texas almost as early as sand
tempering. Bone occurs as an aplastie in a small percentage of nearly
all pottelT types in the state, with the exception of those in transPecos (Suhm and Jelks 1962). It is the major aplastie in the pottelT
type Leon Plain of Central Texas. It occurs in Goose Creek, Alto,
Sanders, Frankston and less frequently in Titus and Texarkana
ceramics. In northwestern Louisiana bone tempering occurs in a
small percentage (up to 3~) of pre-Caddoan and Caddoan ceramics
(Fulton and "vVebb 1953, Webb 1948, 1959). It is present in Fourche
Maline pottery in Oklahoma, and Frank Schambaeh (personal eonlmunieation 1968) has found considerable amounts of bone-tempered

pottery as far east as the Ouachita River in south-central Arkansas, in
what he terms Lowland Fourche Maline, on a presumed Tchefuncte
time level; in these two states bone tempering diminishes or disappears
in later Caddoan wares.
These three ceramic traditions are associated, in their earliest
manifestations, with projectile point and tool types carried over from
the Late Archaic. No immediate and substantial change in the way
of life is in evidence as pottery was introduced.
It seems pertinent to the study of these ceramic traditions to report
our findings at the Resch Site in Harrison County, Texas, in which
the ceramics cover the span from Tchefuncte to early Caddoan times
and within which the three aplastics-bone, sand and clay-are ahnost
equally represented. Evidences of trends in popularity of these
aplastics are available; the associated artifacts will be examined with
especial attention to projectile point changes; and speculations will.
be entertained about the way of life of the people who left these
artifacts.
LOCATION OF THE SITE
The Resch Site, 41HS16, is located on lands owned by Frank Resch,
Jr., of Marshall, Texas, and is 9 miles southwest of this town, in the
southern part of Harrison County. Approximate Latitude is 32Â° 26â
30" N; Longitude 94Â° 25â 30" W. The site is situated on the east
bank of Potterâs Creek, about 5 miles northwest of the outflow of
Potterâs Creek into the Sabine River (Fig. 1). The site covers a clearing of about 5 acres on an almost level terrace which is elevated 7 to
8 feet above the narrow flood plain. Now in pasture, the clearing was
cultivated for many years and at one time a farm house was situated
thereon. It is ,~ mile north of Farm Road 9.625.
TOPOGRAPHY AND NATURAL SETTING
Potterâs Creek is a small stream which rises in the hill country west
of Marshall, one of a number of small streams which drain the southern half of Harrison County into the Sabine River (the northern half
is in the Cypress Bayou-Caddo Lake drainage system and a small
sector of the southeastern part of the county drains into Cross Lake;
both of these eventually reach the Red River). Potterâs Creek flows
southward and slightly eastward to the Sabine at the southern edge
of the county. The entire valley of Potterâs Creek from the level of the
site to its terminus is only 1 to 9, miles wide; it is widened at the level
of the site by two small tributaries from the east (Fig. 1). The actual
flood plain is about 600 feet wide and the active stream bed is 30-40

feet in width. It is moderately rapid and carries a good volume of
water the year round despite its small size. When the site was first
visited the water was dear and flesh but during the past three years
it has become badly polluted. Below the site the stream has few
tributaries and meanders more than at the site level although the
valley narrows to no more than a mile in width.

TEXAS AI~CHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

Flanking the flood plain are numerous small rises, representing
dissected and flattened hill remnants or stream terraces. Further laterally are the slopes of the dissected sand-clay hills, with a soil which
has a high content of iron and contains hematite and sandstone
nodules.
This is rolling hill country within the confines of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. It is in the Aushâoriparian Biotic Province of East Texas,
described previously by Davis and Davis (1960), Jelks and Tunnell
(1959), Johnson (1969,) and others. The rainfall averages 40-50
inches annually, supporting an abundant vegetation. The hills surrounding the site are pine-clad with scattered oak, hickory, persimmon and sweetgum trees. Along the terraces and the stream valley
the trees are in greater variety including oaks, chris, gums, walnuts,
several varieties of hickories (Shagbark, Hicoria ovata, and Texas
hickory, Carya buckleyi, producing hickory nuts; Hieoria pecan, or
native pecans, and Hicoria glabra, producing pignuts), birches, sassafras, persimmons, hawthorns, hackberries, wild cherries and wild
plums, chinquapins and rare bois dâarc or osage orange. Shrubs,
including huckleberries; vines, including blackberries, wild grapes
and nmscadines; and numerous varieties of weeds produce a thick
underbrush in the flood plain. Clearings on the terraces and sloping
hills quickly grow crabgrass, bermuda grass and sedge. The number
of native food sources in this list is impressive.
Native animal life is still abundant: two species of rabbits, three
species of squirrels, opossums, raccoons, deer, black bear, foxes,
wolves or coyotes, occasional bobcats and pumas, gophers (unfortunately), minks and skunks are all present; armadillos have invaded
within recent years, and in former years otters, beavers and prairie
dogs were indigenous. Snakes are not infrequent, including water
snakes, king snakes and the poisonous varieties of moccasins and copperheads (as we learned to our sorrow when one of the children was
bitten by a copperhead during an afternoonâs dig and was desperately
ill for a few days). Numerous birds include quail, doves and woodcock of the more edible species. Migratory waterfowl include ducks,
geese, cranes and herons; during the 19th century passenger pigeons,
turkeys, and trumpeter swans abounded. Before the stream became
polluted, fish and turtles were present but the small size of the stream
makes it unlikely that either they or shellfish were important food
sources in aboriginal times. It seems more likely that nuts, fruits,
plentiful indigenous and seasonal game, and arable soil for horticulture were the attractions in this valley.

ARCHEOLOCICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND OCCUPATIONS
Harrison County reflects an intermediate archeological position
between east Texas and northwestern Louisiana, probably because
of its connection with both Sabine and Red River drainages. Sites
in the northeastern part of the county show affiliation with the Coles
Creek, Bossier and Beleher complexes, while others in the county
relate to Alto, Titus or Frankston Fool. The indicated pre-ceramie
complexes include Early and Late Paleo-Indian (Clovis, Plainview,
Seottsbluff, Meserve and San Patrice) and La Harpe Aspect Archaic,
judging by projectile points found on the surface.
The valley of Potterâs Creek was occupied during each of the
culture periods known for this part of East Texas, from Archaic to
European contact times. Despite the wooded terrain a surprising
number of sites are known (Fig. 1) in the vieinity of the Resch Site.
hnmediately north of the site, across a small draw, a terrace elevation
has surface finds of sherds and chips. Minimal testing showed materials similar to those at Resch, signifying scattered occupation during
the same time period. Further north (Fig. 1-2) another knoll has thin
Archaic occupation, although the collection is inadequate for classification. Still further north, the Jones South Mound (knoll) is ~ mile
from Resch Site, lyin~ between Potterâs Creek and a tributary, Starkey
Creek (Fig. 1-3). Plain clay-tempered sherds, ineluding those of a
bowl with incurving rim, and one linear punctated sherd do not provide information which is adequate for specific assignment. Another
small site (Fig. 1-4) on the Jones Ranch is similarly not assignable.
The third site on this ranch, Jones Pine Tree Mound (knoll), is
approximately ill miles northeast of Resch Site (Fig. 1-5). Sherds
there are more abundant; clay and bone tempering are about equally
represented. Pottery types Pease Brush-Incised, Karnack BrushedIneised, Ripley Engraved, unidentified linear punctated, red-filmed
plain and numerous other plain sherds are represented.1
Across Potterâs Creek from the Resch Site are three sites: Resch
Burial Mound, High Knoll, and Susie Slade buria! site (Fig. 1-6, 7, 8).
High Knoll has limited surface findings and is not assigned. Excavations at the Resch Burial Mound disclosed burial pits which were
9. to 5 feet in depth; skeletal material had ahnost vanished but apparently the bodies were extended. Burial placements included pottery
vessels of types Ripley Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Glassell En1Reference concerning potterv types should be made to the Texas Hand-book
(Suhm and Jelks 1962), to Fordâs group for the Lower Mississippi (Ford 1951,

graved, Cass Appliqued, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Karnack BrushedIncised, arrow points of types Bassett and Perdiz, and polished celts.
The combination of Belcher Focus and Titus Focus ceramics is
further evidence of the intermediate position of Harrison County
between the Caddoan complexes of northwestern Louisiana and East
Texas. Twenty-five pottery vessels were available for study; of these
13 were bone-tempered, and 19. were clay-tempered. Although not
consistently true, there was a tendency for the Belcher Focus vessels
to be clay-tempered, while the majority of the Titus vessels were
bone-tempered.
The Susie Slade Site, 41HS13 (Fig. 1-8) afforded materials of the
European contact period, with many pottery vessels and with trade
goods in most burials, including glass trade beads, metal knives and
bridle parts. Recognized pottery types were Simms Engraved, Taylor
Engraved, Maddox Engraved and Maydelle Incised, all in clay-tempered paste. No shell-tempered pottery was found at this or any other
site in the valley.
Downstream, and also on the west side of Potterâs Creek, the old
Brown Place ( Fig. 1-9) is a village site on a terrace overlooking a relict
channel. The sampling is small but three whole pottery vessels from
a burial and sherds from the surface indicate an early Titus Focus
occupation, similar to the situation reported at the Harroun (Jelks
and Tunnell 1959) and Whelan (Davis 1958) sites. One of the vessels
is a bottle with cylindrical spout, the top of which has encircling
engraved lines like those seen on Hickory Engraved bottles of Alto
ceramics; the body has a courant scroll design with central circles and
with pendant or tented heavy spurred triangles; it probably would be
classified as ttipley Engraved. A bowl is carinated and shouldered;
the shoulder bears Avery Engraved decoration, while the flaring rim
has encircling engraved lines. A third bowl, also carinated and with
notched lip, has two horizontal rows of scratchy engraving forming
a tented design. All vessels are clay-tempered. Accompanying projectiles are predominantly Bonham type, with one or two which could
be called Alba.
At Henry Brown Sites No. 1 and No. 2 (Fig. 1-10, 11) on opposite
sides of Potterâs Creek about 2 miles south of the tleseh Site, burial
placements showed both villages to represent the contact period,
although there were defiinite differences in the pottery complexes.
At Henry Brown No. 1, on the west side of the stream, there were
glass trade beads, trade knives and clay-tempered pottery of types
Simms and Taylor Engraved. At Henry Brown Site No. 2 a number of
burials contained glass trade beads, a brass or copper disc, and pot-

Natehitoches Engraved, Wilkinson Incised, Cass Appliqued, Maydelle

Of the 13 pottery vessels available for study, 6 were bone-tempered, 7
c!ay-tempered. Affiliations with Allen, late Titus and Glendora Foci
are suggested by vessel types.
EXPLORATION AND EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
The existenee of the Resch Site had been known to the Reseh
family sinee the time of the present ownerâs grandfather and the site
had been clear and in cultivation for many years. Forrest Murphey,
Wesley Ellis, Roland Green and their wives, of Marshall, Texas,
explored the site while they were engaged in excavations of the Resch
Burial Mound and Susie Slade Sites across the creek. During 1963 and
1964 they made prelimina~T tests to discover the depth of the midden
and the possible nature of its contents. In one of these trial pits Mrs.
Murphey unearthed, at about the .3 foot level, fragments of an entire
vessel of Tehefuncte pottery (Figs. 8 d and 9). Realizing the unusual
nature of this vessel and of the sherds and lithics found at the site,
they contaeted professional archeologists. Buddy Jones saw the site
and identified the vessel, but was unable to give assistance at that
time. The senior author was later contacted by Wesley Ellis and made
arrangements to visit the site in early 1965.
This site is on the southernmost of two adjoining clearings, each
about 4 to 5 aeres in size, and both recently reverted to pasture land.
Occasional surface sherds or chert flakes are to be found over most
of the !ower clearing but are concentrated nearer the stream. The
major part of the site is along the crest and slopes of a mildly eroded
terrace (Fig. 2) that is irregularly oval in shape along a NW-SE axis.
Potterâs Creek swings sharply against the northwestern portion of the
terrace and apparently has eroded into it at its highest level, which
is 7 to 8 feet above the flood plain. From this high point the terrace
slopes gradually away from the stream and also slopes gently southward. At the southwest angle of the clearing (Fig. 2) the s!ope is
steeper, down to flood plain level; at this point the creek swings westward into the valley but traces of an old channel eut across the
southern edge of the site. In the center of the clearing, immediately
east of the major site, there is a !ow area whieh is marshy in wet
weather and shows no evidence of aboriginal occupation, although
there are traces of occupation east of it, along the margin of the
clearing. At the southeastern end of the site there is another oval-

shaped depression, tree-covered, which has the appearance of a
borrow pit (possibly resultant from road building during the 19th
century, although we could find no record of such). It is known that
a dirt road passed through the site, near the present road (Fig. 2) and
that a house was located at the south end of the excavated area.
Work was started on the site on March 14, 1965. After the preliminary survey, base-line N-S and E-W coordinate axes, based on magnetic north, were set in the area chosen for initial investigation, near
the place where the Tchefuncte vessel was found. A metal stake was
implanted at the 0-0 intersection and this was triangulated with nails
set in two trees, a gum on the bank of the stream west of the intersection and a pine to the northeast (Fig. 2 A, B ). That part of the site
around the intersection was staked in a grid of 5-foot squares. The
excavation began in the first 3 squares south of the horizontal axis
(E-W) and parallel to the east side of the vertical axis. By agreement
bordering lines or profiles were recorded simply in feet from the
original coordinate axes and squares were recorded by number in
relation to these axes (i.e., the first three squares were E1S1, EIS2
and E1sg).
Participants in this initial excavation were the authors and their
wives, Dr. A. L. Wedgeworth of Shreveport, his son Lang and daughter Ann, and Dr. Antley of Barksdale Field, La. Subsequently other
friends and visitors have given assistance for which the authors are
appreciative. These include the owner, Frank Iteseh, Jr., and members
of his family, all of whom have had a sustained interest and have
prevented depredation; Burney MeClurkan, who investigated the site
as a possibility for the 1966 Texas summer dig, and his son Kevin;
Lou Fraser, Kelly Arnold, Billy Maloney, Terry Itoden, Michael Beckman, Reverend Jim Simpson, Monroe Dodd, Jr. and his family, tlosemary Webb and the Webb grandchildren, Sarah, Bill, John and
Larkin. Most of the excavations were carried out between 1965 and
1968 by the Murpheys, Ellis and Greens, joined by the Webbs on
40-50 afternoons. The dig has been conducted as a family affair, with
the wives attending to creature comforts like food, refreshments and
care of the children, when they were not participating in the excavations. Tarpaulin shelter, refrigeration, eleetrieity for lighting, eampfire
cooking, garden vegetables in the excavated areas, and even television
have been available, with lounge chairs for respite from digging. The
senior author highly recommends this comfortable approach to areheological exploration; withal a high quality of technique was attempted.
Records were kept by Murphey and Webb, and Webb accepted the
responsibilities of typology and description.

Each square was excavated by 6-inch vertical levels, since no
natural stratigraphy was discernible. Levels were recorded as Levels
1 to 9 beginning from the surface. Each level was troweled by thin
vertical slicing or horizontal shaving, dirt was screened when this
seemed indicated by the appearance of small objects and, after completion of each level, its floor was scraped to look for features. Excavations were carried 6 to 12 inches below the last appearance of artifacts
or midden stain, usually 48 to 60 inches. Objects from each 6-inch level
were placed in labeled sacks and at the end of each dayâs work they
were cleaned and individually labeled by Murphey, indicating square
and depth by level. At intervals they were transferred to Webb for
typing and tabulation. In most instances individual squares were
worked and refilled as completed, since this was pasture land and
open pits were avoided. Balks were left between squares to record
profiles and prevent caving; after adjoining squares were worked, the
balks were troweled. In some instances 2 to 5 adjoining squares were
excavated sinmltaneously, when the party was large, or in order to
uncover or search for features, or to secure profiles. Field sketches
were made by Murphey or Webb.
In the central block (Figs. 2, 3) 245 squares were excavated, a total
of 6,19.5 square feet. In addition 13 squares were dug as tests outside
the immediate periphery of this block; 19 were dug across the access
road on the east side; and 8 were dug north of the N100 foot line
along the highest part of the ridge. Three test squares were placed
adjacent to the borrow pit along the old stream bed south of the
clearing (Fig. 2), Altogether 288 squares were dug, covering 7,200
square feet of surface and incorporating approximately 9,5,000 cubic
feet of midden.
I~ESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS
Over the major excavation block, the top 7 to 11 inches were a sandy
loam topsoil of the plow zone, with grass, weed and shrub roots in
abundance, and with many interruptions. At least by the 19,-inch
depth, on Level 3, a homogeneous midden zone appeared. This zone
is of fairly loose sand with enough clay and midden humus to make
this a darker reddish-brown sandy loam, and it continues down to
the 30-36 inch depths of Levels 5 and 6. The soil then shifted to a
lighter color with numerous white sand streaks and a number of small
sand cones that were vertical, circular on cross section, and 3~ to ~
inch in diameter ( Fig. 4 A, C). At a depth of 36 to 49, inches, by Level
8, clearwhite sand appeared and continued as far as we tested, which
was usually down to 48-60 inches but in a few instances was as deep

part of this sand were followed. Some appeared to be small aboriginal
disturbances, although none had the characteristics of a storage pit
or recognizable appendage to a house structure. Others seemed to be
deep root penetrations.
Many profiles and horizonta! levels were recorded; several exampies are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 A illustrates a typical profile taken
from the initial 3 squares near the 0-0 intersection. The floor of these

we thought could result from insect burrows, tree roots, a water filtration phenomenon, or some similar non-human agency. They were
much too regular in size and distribution to have resulted from stakes
or wands stuck in the sand by inhabitants. There were many rodent
and insect burrows in the midden, also a number of large vertical
columns or cones of burned soil, charcoal and sometimes rotting
wood, interpreted as burned stumps resultant from land clearing in
the last century. These originated from the top 12 inches.
The topsoil and first few inches of midden of Levels 1 and 2 contained few aboriginal artifacts, such as flakes, stone tools, and occasional sherds. There were many objects from the 19th or early 20th
century occupation, including square nails, crockery sherds, buttons,
household and farm implement fragments, and rotting cedar or cypress
wood. Beginning with Level 3 below 19. inches, these objects disappeared with rare exceptions in intrusions, and aboriginal artifacts
progressively increased in numbers, with the gnâeatest concentration in
Levels 5, 6 and 7. They became very scanty in the white sand of
Levels 8 and 9. Figs. 21, 22 indicate these trends. Objects like sherds,
projectile points, knives, scrapers, flakes and other smaller objects
tended to be dispersed throughout the midden thickness; similarly
they were scattered horizontally throughout the excavated block,
with only a few concentrations (Fig. 3). Debris consisting of hematite
and sandstone nodules, petrified wood slabs or fragments, whole and
broken small chert cobbles, and flakes, was found throughout the
midden. One of the excavators coined the term "stash pits" for the
frequent clusters of pebbles, with occasional artifacts, found in filled
gopher tunnels.
Clusters of larger stone objects included hammerstones, manos,
pitted stones, anvils, and fire-darkened and cracked sandstones. Fig.
4 C illustrates the occurrence, at the 33-36 inch depth of Square EIS3,
of such cluster: a hematite hammerstone, a pitted stone and a broken
sandstone. Fig. 4 E shows a larger group, between the 30-36 inch
levels of Squares E7S1 and E8S1, which includes 9,1 sandstone cobbles
averaging fist size and many fire-blackened or broken; 50 small pebbles
of sandstone, petrified wood and hematite; a few fragments of charcoal; and 44 stone flakes. Eighteen of the flakes were of petrified wood,
9 of tan chert, 7 of red chert and 10 of gray chert or flint. At the edges
of this debris were 2 pot-sherds, 2 dart points and a chert knife. This
was interpreted as a hearth, although ash was missing and the soil
was not fire-hardened. The location of a number of these clusters is
indicated in Fig. 3. The largest was found in 4 adjoining squares,
E15-16, N16-17, at the 30-36 inch depth in which many of these

accumulations occurred (Fig. 5). This was a mass of stones over an
irregular area, 5 to 6 feet in diameter, numbering several hundred
and varying in size from pebbles to rocks 7 to 8 inches in diameter and
weighing 10 to 15 pounds. Included were masses and flat segments
of iron-sandstone, hematite of hard and soft varieties, petrified wood
and chert cobbles. Several could have been used as hammerstones or
anvils and one was a pitted stone, but most showed no evidence of
use. Also, curiously, no charcoal, ash or artifacts were in association.
The purpose of this rockpile is only conjectural and possibly it was
simply this-a rockpile for future use.
We found no prepared hearths and no ash beds with associated
animal bones which might indicate cooking areas. Moreover, despite
a few molds which might represent posts set by the inhabitants, we
found none which were arranged in anything like a house structure. In
3 adjoining squares (F~g. 4 E) 4 molds of 4 inch diameter and a
larger mold, 16-18 inches in diameter and charcoal-stained, showed
on tlie 30 inch level. The large interruption could be followed fiâom

THE IRESCH SITE

17

12 inch depth to 42 inch, the smaller molds could be followed from
30 to 36 inch depth. However, no adjoining squares had molds to
form a pattern with these.
No evidence of burials was found. The few bones found were
badly decayed and all seemed to be animal bones. A few were recognized as deer bones but most were inadequately preserved to alloW
identification-often only streaks of white bone in the midden sand.
Fragments of charred walnuts, hickory nuts and pignuts were scattered through the middens. No other plant food sources were recognized. Only small fragments or streaks of wood charcoal were found,
apart from the burned wood in the tree stump interruptions. Nut
and wood charcoal was saved for radiocarbon dating.
In the southwestern sector of the excavated block a number of
previously dug and filled pits were recorded (Fig. 3). The fill of these
pits rarely contained artifacts, except for flakes and discarded spalls,
and those few that were found were not used for stratigraphie analysis.
The surface in this sector slopes rapidly toward the old stream bed,
beginning about 20 feet southwest of the 0-0 intersection, but the
midden and the subjacent midden-sand junction had a similar downhill
trend, so that it was not necessary to correct the depth relationship of
recovered objects in analyzing the artificial stratigraphy. In fact, the
midden thickness varied surprisingly little over the entire site.
We had hoped that the northern end of the terrace, immediately
by the stream, would show a heavier midden and a higher yield of
artifacts. However, the 8 test squares (Fig. 2) north of the N100 foot
line, nearly all in a wooded area, were less productive than most of
the excavation block. On the northern crest the top 18 inches consisted of a 6 inch zone of topsoil with root masses, then a 12 inch zone
(Fig. 4 B ) of lighter sand below which was the darker homogeneous
sand-loam midden. Ve13~ little was found in the top 18 inches and 4
of the 5 sherds from Levels 1-3 had the characteristics of Coles Creek
or Early Caddoan. The midden below the upper sand had a mixed
zone on top at 18-9.6 inch depth, then the dark homogeneous zone
down to about 50 inches, then the streaked zone to approximately
59.-56 inches, below which was sterile white sand as shown in Fig.
4 B. In one of the northern squares, WllN38, a cluster of burned
and broken sandstones occurred at the 48 inch level, Level 8 (Fig.
4 D). The evidenee therefore is that the original occupation in the
northern part of the ridge was at about the same elevation as at the
excavation block and that the present higher elevation at the northern
end is the result of deposit of sand on top of the terrace after the
major oecupation of the site. The mechanisms by which the midden

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

18

was built up uniformly by a 2~-3 foot increment during occupation
of the site and by which the superimposed sand was deposited on the
northern end after its desertion were not revealed by excavation.
There were no discernible layers of water-deposited sand or clay.
The three tests along the old stream and near the borrow pit south
of the site showed shallow middens with only traces of occupation.
The midden was no more than a foot in depth, slightly darkened,
with rapid transition to the sterile subjacent sand. Rarely were flakes
and broken stones found. These evidences of light occupation discouraged further exploration.
The eastern slope of the terrace between the access road and the
depression in the center of the clearing (Fig. 2) was more productive.
There were 19 squares excavated in this area. The midden had about
the same thickness as in the excavated block and the density of
occupational evidences averaged about half that of the major block.
Ten sherds were found in Square E23N2, 9 of these in Level 5 (24-30
inches). Square E16N16 yielded 7 sherds, 6 of these in Levels 6 and 7.
Otherwise a low yield of 1 to 4 sherds per 5 foot square indicated a
diminished occupation. The only feature of significance in this part of
the site was the large roekpile in Squares E15-16 N16-I7. We coneluded that the major occupation of the site was along the NW-SE
axis of the higher terrace remnant paralleling the stream. Major excavations were confined to the southern portion of this because it was
in open pasture, in contrast to the wooded northern pol~ion, and also
because it did not have the additional foot of soil overburden. The
absence of trees made it possible to excavate a large block completely.
ARTIFACTS
A.

CERAMICS

There are 1541 pottery sherds from the site, excluding those from
which the original Tchefuncte vessel (Fig. 9) was assembled. The
latter had been found and the vessel finished before organized excavation was undertaken, but the vessel is included because its location
was within the excavated area and three additional sherds were found.
Three additional vessels have been assembled from the excavated
sherds, one completely, the other two in major part suffleient for reconstruction (Fig. 8). For the latter two, sherds are present to complete
the bases, major sections of the rim and enough body sherds to assure
continuity hâom base to lip. Lesser portions of other vessels have
been fitted together, but insufficient to justify reconstruction. Sherds
from which these vessels and segments were assembled are included

THE RESCH SITE

19

in the sherd studies but the individual vessels will also be described
under type studies.
The ceramics fiâom this site show an interesting but disconcerting
diversity. A respectable percentage fits into established types, from
Tehefunete, Marksville, Troyville and Coles Creek ceramics as described in the Lower Mississippi Valley (Ford and Quimby 1945,
Ford and Willey 1940, Ford 1951) and from pre-Caddoan and early
Caddoan ceramics of East Texas (Newe!l and Krieger 1949, Suhm and
Jelks 1962, Jelks 1965). However, much of the pottery does not fit
these established types, and further diffleulties obtain in that a high
percentage of sherds is undecorated. Moreover, a variety of aplastics
used as intentional tempering or aeeidenta!ly included makes for
difficulties in organizing the material into a distinctive indigenous
tradition. There are present three major aplastics-clay or grog
(ground sherd), bone, and sand-which we think are intentional
tempering materials; there are at least seven minor and probably
accidental kinds of inclusions: hematite and gravel granules, charcoal,
ash, ocher, quartz and burned-out vegetal material. To compound
the typological difficulties, nearly half (43 percent) of the sherds
(Table 3 ) have a mixture of two or more of these aplastics.
The decision was made to study and describe the ceramics in a
tri-partite way: first, by dividing the sherds into three groups in
accordance with the major aplastie, regardless of recognized types,
and determining the characteristics within each group; secondly,
reclassifying by recognized types or indicated groupings regardless of
tempering; and finally, to assess the possible significance of the previous groupings through distributional or stratigraphie studies. The first
method of study is pursued with fu!l knowledge of the fact that many
existing pottery types have varying temper characteristics and that
some aplastics may be accidental or due to local variations in available clay beds. However, we have noted that the three major aplasties
had different origins and histories during the development of ceramics
in eastern Texas. Moreover, this decision was strengthened by indications, borne out by complete studies (Tables 1, 2), that vessel wall
thickness, throughout the life of the site, was distinctly different for
bone, sand, and clay-tempered sherds, despite expected overlaps.
This difference extends also to those sherds which are sorted by major
aplastie, even though a mixture is present: sherds tempered with
bone, alone or as the major aplastie, are thicker; those tempered with
sand are intermediate in thickness; and clay-tempered sherds average
having the thinnest walls; even the extremes of wall thickness follow
the same trends (Table 1).

1. SAND-TEMPERED POTTERY There are 364 sherds which we classify
as sand-tempered (Table 3). Of these 149 have sand as the only
recognized aplastic, 107 have sand with small amounts or a few flagments of bone, 92 have sand with smaller amounts of clay particles or
grog, and 16 have all three aplastics but sand is the major one. With
two exceptions, to be described below, there are no perceptible
differences in other physical characteristics between those sherds
tempered with sand alone and those in which other materials appeared. In addition to these three aplastics, 23 of the 364 sherds have
one to several granules of hematite per sherd; these nodules are
smooth, round or ovoid, and 1 to 8 ram. in diameter.
As a group the sand-tempered sherds are firm to very hard, are
rarely crumbly except when the surface has been eroded, and in
most instances have adequate clay matrix to assure good agglutination
of the small sand grains. Although the surfaces have a gritty feel and
fine particles of quartz glisten with reflected light, the manufacture

THE

seems to have included enough surface rubbing to float a thin coating
of clay to the surfaces and make them reasonably smooth on both
exterior and interior. However, when two sherds are rubbed together,
a grittier sound is made than is true of the clay-or bone-tempered
sherds. Sherd size, about the same as in the clay-tempered, varies
from 1 to 8 cm. in greatest diameter and most of the sherds are between 2 and 5 era. in diameter. A generally rectangular shape suggests
that the vessel walls were built up by coils, although the few bases
available seem to have been made in a unit. Thickness of the body

walls (Table 1) ranges from 4 to 13 mm., averaging 7.6 mm. in the
sherds which are tempered with sand alone and 7.7 mm. for those
with mixed temper in which sand predominates. Bases vary from 9
to 18 mm. in thickness.
Surface and core coloration of the sand-tempered sherds indicates
variations of firing temperatures and conditions, with some possible
variations resultant from the paste characteristics. Of the 364 sherds,
142 (39.01Y~) have uniform colors of exterior and interior surfaces
and cores, usually light colors which include buff, orange, light to
dark gray and light brown. Oxidizing temperatures are indicated.
Some 122 sherds (33.51Y~) have the same range of lighter colors on

22

the exterior with black or dark gray for the interior and much of the
core. This is presumably from fring in inverted position with smoke
darkening of the interior. Fifty-five sherds (15.11~) are black on both
surfaces and throughout the cores, indicating reduced firing conditions; another 21 sherds (5.77g), representing two vessels, are dark
brown to black throughout Seven sherds have light coloration of
exterior and interior surfaces, with black cores; 5 have gray to black
surfaces and vmT light cores. The remaining few sherds are variable,
probably as a result of fire clouds. Two matching sherds with uniform
color have a black substance on the exterior, possibly asphaltum.
The 364 sherds encompass 99 rim, 5 fragments of bases and 330
from the body walls. Four sherds have conical perforations, drilled
from the outside. Two of these, presumably from the same vessel,
are rim sherds in which the perforations are 3.5 em. from the lip.
Nearly all of the 29 rims are vertical and direct (Fig. 6 i); none has
the appearance of flaring or outward rolling. The lips are rounded in
most instances, sometimes thinned by an external bevel. Six rims have
flat lips, equal in thickness to the vessel walt. Four rims are incurvate,
all with thinned, rounded lips, and two of these have lip notching;
the notches are fairly deep, placed diagonally in one instance and
transversely in the other (Fig. 6 e, f). Additionally, three of the rims
with flat lips have tiny notches on the outer lip edge. Two of the latter
probably derive from the same vessel, hence sherds from 4 vessels
have notched lips; all others are plain.
Of the 5 basal sherds, three are small fragments which give no idea
of size or shape. One is a complete small flat disc, 5.5 cm. in diameter
and 9 em. thick, with smooth exterior and rough interior surface. It is
sand-tempered with a small amount of grog. Around the periphery
there are 4 indentations, with an edge projecting downward, suggesting that the adjacent wall may have had podal projections (Fig. 10 j ).
The other basal sherd represents about ~ of the total base and is similarly small, about 5.5-6 era. in diameter and 15 ram. in thickness. The
ventral surface is concave and the doughnut-like edge extends directly
upward for 1 era. before curving outward (Fig. 10 f). It also has a
mixture of sand with a small amount of grog, and the core is puddled
or contorted as often seen in Tehefuncte sherds. No sherds which
suggested a conical base were found.
The 330 body sherds are remarkable, insofar as evidence of shape
are concerned, mostly in a negative way, except the four groups of
matching sherds noted below. Fairly uniform size and shape is indicated by sherd curvatures; there are no appendages, appliques or
acute angulations to indicate wall modifications.

FIG. 6. Sand-tempered sherds. Plain sherds and vessel portions: a-f; notched

Five groups of matching sherds could be fitted to form sections of
vessels. One of these will be described under decorated sherds. A
second group consists of 13 sherds with heavy sand tempering, almost
sandstone in consistency, reddish-buff in color, shading to black near
the vessel base. They derive from what appears to be a flowerpot-like
small vase form (Fig. 6 b), with wails which thicken from 0 mm. in the
upper portion to 13 ram. where the wall joins the base, which apparently was circular and thick. The outer surface is irregular and has
shallow vertical flutings placed 1.5-S em. apart, which corresponds to
the distance between an adultâs fingers, suggesting vertical smoothing
with the open hand.
Three other sherd groups are fitted to form sections of deep open
bowls or "flowerpot" vases. A group of 20 forms the lower wall of a
vessel, indicating a circular base of 8-9 cm. diameter, and outward

flaring walls (Fig. 6 c). Another group of 21 sherds derives from the
rim and upper wall of two vessels; one is a deep bowl and the other
seems to be a vase form. Rim diameters of 24-28 era. are indicated
(Fig. 6 a, d). These sherds are preponderantly sand-tempered with
some coarse bone and nodules of:hematite; they have sufficient day
matrix to give a very compact paste, and they are well fired to a redbrown color. The result is a hard, almost metallic ware which rings
when tapped and which we dubbed "East Texas ironware"; it is the
hardest and firmest prehistoric pottery which we have seen from this
area.
Decorated sherds: Of the 364 sand-tempered sherds, only 18 (4.95
percent) are decorated, if we except the plain sherds with notched
lips. Four of the 18 are from one vessel, including two rim sherds (Fig.
6 g, h). The indicated shape is a barrel-like jar with vertical rim and
flat lip, with wall thickness of 8-11 cm. The paste is sandy with rare
bone and hematite fragments, as hard as the "ironware" described
above. The entire outer surface is decorated with firm incised lines.
Two parallel lines encircle the rim, and between the upper line and
the lip there are vertical nail punetations. Body panels are indicated,
with concentric circles or ares surrounding a central rectangle. Separating these major panels are small double groups of concentric rectangles. Two other small sherds have single deeply incised straight
lines and two have curving incised lines. Two rim sherds have diagonal lines incised with a notched or forked tool to produce double
incisions, and another small sherd has multiple, closely placed parallel incisionsl One large and 3 small sherds of another vessel show a
single horizontal incised line, above which are V-shaped lines which
possibly form alternating triangles (Fig. 6 k). One sand-tempered
sherd has tool punetations zoned by deeply incised lines (Fig. 10 p),
another has horizontal incised lines. The final decorated sherd is
black, sand-tempered, firm, with nail pinches which form V-shaped or
triangular punctations (Fig. 10 e).
Vessel shapes .which are indicated by the above descriptions include
deep bowls, large "flowerpot" vase forms with gently curving lower
walls, cylindrical and barrel-shaped jars, and bowls with constricted
rims. Flat disc bases and concave extended bases are indicated and
tetrapods are possible. Shallow :finger fluting of lower vessel walls
occurs.

9,. BONE-TEMPEnED POTTEI~Y There are 599 predominantly bonetempered sherds from the site (Table 3) of which 397 areâtempered
with bone alone, 169 with bone and some sand, 9,1 with bone and
small: amounts of clay-grog, and 12 with all three aplasties but with

bone predominating. Only 12 of the b0ne-tempered sherds show
particles of hematite, which indicates that the potters were less likely
to pick up this extraneous material when theyused bone for the
aplastie than when they used sand or grog. However, many of the
sherds of all three wares had tiny brown specks or smudges which
we interpreted as due to the presence of hematite ocher in the local
clays.
In general physical characteristics this is a good ware. The sherds
are firm, with a greater tendency to brittleness than the clay or sandtempered sherds. The surfaces, except when there is considerable sand
in the paste, are smooth but not polished. Wedging of the paste is
somewhat better than in the other wares, although the larger particles
of bone make this imperfect. Sherd size varies more; there are numerous large sherds, in excess of 6 cm., but also many small fragments,
apparently due to the brittle quality; numerous small sherds are
split through the core. Unit~ construction of the bases and coiling for
the vessel wails is indicated by sherd fracture; the coil breaks are
often beveled, indicating that they were welded by shearing motions
of the hands, as described by Aten (1967) at the Jamison site. In the
Resch sherds this motion was upward or from the base toward the rim
on the exterior, downward on the interior, which is opposite to that
described by Aten. Body, walls are thicker than in the other wares,
with a range of 5 to 13 mm.-and averages of 8.3 mm. for sherds tempered with bone alone, 8.0 mm. with mixed temper (Table 1). There
is no evidence for a change in this tendency during the occupation
of this site (Table 2). Bases were 12-17 ram. thick.
âThe external surface coloration is mote pleasing than in the other
wares. Reds, oranges and reddish buff c0!ors predominate, with lesser
numbers of varying shades of gray~ and a few dark brown to black.
A white speckled appearance is given by the numerous bone particles,
which vary from barely visible up to 5 mm. in diameter. Few of the
sherds are smoothed sufficiently to float er~ough clay to the surface
to cover the bone particles. Firing is variable, so that clouds or variations in color on the same vessel are produced; oxidation is generally
more complete than in the clay-tempered sherds from this site. Of the
599 sherds, 169 (27.88~) are uniformly light in color throughout the
core; 290 (48.41~) have,light colors on the exterior with darker,cores
and interior, surfaces; 59 (9.85%) are dark on both surfaces, and
through the core; and 51 (8.51~) have light surfaces and dark cores.
The599 sherds include 27 rim sherds, 30 derived.from ~bases, and
542 from body walls. Three sherds hav.e:pei?fgrations, two of which
exhibit onnter~ drilling. There are ~no ,vesse~ appendages,,spec!alized

The rims more often are direct, not thinned, with rounded lips
(Fig. 7n). Eighteen are direct, 6 incurvate, 3 excurvate; 10 are
thinned, 17" are not; 17 of the lips are rounded, 9 (including 6 from
Vessel 4) are fiat, and one has a slight external roll. One (Fig. 7 m)
has diagonal incisions across the fiat lip, one with thinned and rounded
lip has tiny notches, and one is a segment of eared rim.
From the 30 basal sherds, 4 complete bases were reconstructed. In

THE

SITE

each of these, the base had broken into 4 sherds. These 4 bases are
9.2, 10, 11.5 and 12.4 cm. in diameter. They are disc-shaped, flat or
gently concave on the interior and gently rounded or convex on the
exterior (Fig. 7 o-q). The other basal fragments show a similar shape,
some being more strongly convex. Vessels with these bases would be
unstable on a flat surface. There are no podal appendages or evidences of concave, squared or extended bases.
The 542 body sherds are not remarkable, except that the thickness
and curvatures on many indicate a moderately large size, consistent
with Vessel 4 described below. This conclusion is also suggested by
the fact that 90 percent of the total bone-tempered sherds are from
the body wall, i0 percent from rims and bases combined. The same
proportions hold for the sand-tempered sherds, and these may be
compared with a proportion of 81~ body sherds among the clay-tempered. Moreover, two groups of bone-tempered sherds, in addition
to Vessel 4, were matched in sufficient numbers to indicate vessel diameters of 20-25 era.
There are 58 decorated sherds among the 599 bone-tempered
(9.68Y~): 11 of these are rim sherds. Of these, 22 (including 7 rims)
derive from Vessel 4 which has a band decorated with deeply incised
diagonal lines in triangular grouping, with small punctated fields
(Fig. 8 a). Thirteen additional sherds have similar diagonal and parallel lines (Fig. 7 a-e). One of these is a rim sherd with bone and sandtempering. Several have clay or grog temper in addition to the sand,
but bone is the predominant aplastie in the entire group. Three additional sherds have decorations with similar heavy, rounded lines which
form curved patterns (Fig. 7 i-l). In all of these instances the deep,
trailed lines resemble the lines which border the bands of rocker
stamping to be described for the clay-tempered sherds.
Three sherds from the same vessel have a band of decoration which
features alternating groups of diagonal lines and small punetatefilled triangles (Fig. 11 y, z). The incisions and punctations are made
with a pointed tool. One rim sherd shows excurvate form, Two other
sherds have single short incised lines, but the sherds are too small to
disclose a pattern. Three thick sherds have random punetations
made with the fingernail in two instances and with a pointed tool in
the other (Fig. 7 f-h). One rim sherd shows two horizontal lines below the rim which is direct and rounded. Seven bone-tempered sherds
are decorated with brushing (Fig. 11 aa-cc), which in six instances is
vertical and in the seventh diagonal. A thin, well made sherd (Fig.
11 t) shows a combination of brushing and tool punctating. Finally,
there are three bone-tempered sherds from high rims, one showing the

3. CLAY-TEI~IPERED POTTEItS_" There are 563 sherds classified as claytempered. Of these, 332 have clay particles usually recognizable as
crushed sherd (grog) as the only aplastic; 149 have clay with sand or
grit as a second aplastic; 44 have clay as the major tempering but
have a few particles of crushed bone in addition, and 38 have clay as
the major with both sand and bone as minor aplasties. In the total
group, 24 sherds have particles of hematite of the same size as noted
for the sand-tempered sherds.
In comparison with the sand-tempered sherds, the clay-tempered
group tends to be firm but not as hard, lacking the metallic appearance
and ring on tapping. The paste is not uniform and many of the sherds
have a crumbly core. Conversely, the surfaces are smoother and some
of the thinner (Coles Creek and Caddoan) sherds have a homogeneous paste with hard, polished surfaces. The sherd size is comparable
to the sand tempered, 1 to 8 era. in greatest diameter, and most of the
sherds are 2 to 4 era. in diameter, with the same tendency to rectangular breakage which indicates coiling manufacture. The vessel walls
average 7.2 mm. in thickness in those sherds which have only clay
tempering, and 7.0 ram. for those with mixed tempering, with a
range of thickness from 3 to 11 mm. in both groups, As noted in
Table 1, this wall thickness is less than in the sand-tempered or bonetempered sherds. Clay-tempered basal sherds range from 10 to 15
ram. in thickness, averaging between 12 and 13 ram.
The coloration of the surfaces and cores shows more evidence of
firing under reduced temperatures. Only 140 (24.9~) of the 563 sherds
have a uniform light color throughout the core and on both surfaces.
A much larger number, 236 (41.92%), have light colors on the external
surfaces with black to dark brown interiors and cores, and an additional 78 (13.85go) have light exterior and interior surfaces and black
cores. The color range of the oxidized areas includes dove gray, buff,
reddish-orange, medium gray and light brown. The red-buff to light
brown color predominates, but a few thin, polished, orange sherds
are outstanding. There are 90 (16Yo) sherds that are black or dark
brown throughout. One sherd has a black exterior and core, with a
light gray interior. Colors of the remaining 18 sherds are variable or
difflcult to determine because of small size or worn condition. A
single vessel often has variable coloration, with a tendency for the
basal portions to be darker, especially on the interior, and "fireclouds" are often present.
The 563 clay-tempered sherds include 71 rim sherds, of which 3
are rims of bottle spouts; 460 derive from the body wall; 22 from
bases; and 10 additional spout sherds. Only one sherd, a rfin sherd of

30

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

Vessel 3, has a perforation placed 2 cm. below the lip. It is drilled
from the exterior and tapers from 8 ram. in diameter to 5 mm. at the
interior opening. The opposite rim sherd is missing.
The 71 rims (Fig. 7 v) show a much greater tendency toward the
ineurvate form than among the sand-tempered sherds; 33 are ineurvate, 26 direct and only 4 exeurvate. One is not only ineurvate but constricted and cambered (Fig. 11i), 1 has an internal roll and 1 is
angulated and is apparently a section of an eared bowl. A few of the
lips are flat and 1 of these is twice as wide as the vessel wall. Nearly
all are otherwise rounded and slightly thinned. Ten of the rims, ineluding 6 from Vessel 3, have notches across the lips, transversely.
The 3 spout rims (Fig. 11 l-n) are direct and all are decorated with
horizontal engraved lines.
The 22 basal sherds (Fig. 7 w) include 9 with black interior surfaces and light exteriors; 2 black throughout; 5 with black cores and
light surfaces; and only 6 which are light in color throughout the thickness. One base is almost complete, 9 em. in diameter, 10 ram. thick
and gently convex on the lower surface. Seven seem to be portions of
flat discs, one of these having a probable diameter of 9.5-10 era.
Another circular base of similar size is gently concave on its lower
surface. Two have upward extensions of 8-10 ram. on the side wall
before curving outward, and one of these has a deep concavity of the
lower surface (Fig. 10 g), similar to one of the sand-tempered bases.
A small sherd (Fig. 10 h) wffh paste suggestive of Tehefunete Plain
has an outward projection or flange formation of the lower wall;
another small sherd has a mammiform podal projection which is 1.7
ram. in diameter and 5 ram. in height (Fig. 10 i). Two sherds have rim
and base components which show them to derive from flat bowls;
both are plain and have slightly insloping direct rims.
Vessel shapes suggested by the body and rim sherds are shallow,
flat bowls with narrow rims; deeper bowls; flower-pot shaped vases;
jars with rounded bodies and upright or outward sloping high rims;
barrel-shaped or deep semi-globular vessels with constricted orifices;
eylin&ieal jars and bottles with tapered spouts.
Decorations include a greater variety than in the sand or bone-tempered ceramics. There are 49 decorated sherds (8.7%) among the 563
clay-tempered, excluding the 10 with notched rims. Eighteen sherds,
of which 8 are rim segments, have multiple parallel incised lines,
apparently all placed horizontally below the rim (Fig. 11 a-g, w).
Three sherds have a single incised line. Two are small but the third is
larger, with ineurving cambered rim and one smoothly incised line
below the rim (Fig. 11 i). One sherd is deeply incised with parallel

THE

SITE

31

lines in zones (Fig. 10 o). One sherd combines rectilinear incising
with zoned punctating. Another has a single row of punctates in the
center of bands which are outlined by incised lines (Fig. 7 t). Two
sherds with linear triangular stamping, found during the excavation,
derive from Vessel 1. There are 4 sherds, 2 thick, 9. thin, with random
punctations (Fig. 7 r, s), 3 made with tools, one with nail gouges.
Thirteen sherds have rocker stamped decoration in zones outlined
by deep incisions (Fig. 11 l-n). Six sherds have engraved decoration;
4 are bottle spouts with engraved encircling parallel lines. Two are
bottle shoulders with similar encircling engraved lines (Fig. 11 r, s).
Three vessels have been reconstructed from clay-tempered sherds.
Vessel 1 is the discovery Tchefuncte vessel (Fig. 8 d, 9). It is made of
firm, clay-tempered paste, with better wedging than usual for Tchefuncte wares but with a thin powdm7 exterior coat which flakes off
readily. Oxidizing temperatures resulted in light colors on both surfaces and through the eore. Surface colors vary from orange-buff to
greenish to light brown. The shape is a cylindrical jar with constricted
base, mildly flared, rolled rim and rounded lip. The height is 17.2 era.
The diameters are: orifce 15.5 to 15.8 cm., midbody 19. cm., base
10.9, cm. The thickness of the vessel wall varies from 8 mm. near the
lip to 6.5 at midbody and 7 mm. at the base. Only half of the base
was found; it has 11 mammfform podal supports in cog-wheel arrangement around the outer circumference. The decoration consists of 14
enchâeling bands of triangular stamping apparently done with a single
tool. Each band is decorated with alternating upright and pendant
triangles and with a zig-zag ridge of clay of near-uniform width
between the impressions. Between the bands are two parallel encircling lines formed by drag-and-jab technique. Three similar lines
are between the topmost band and the lip, and three lines separate the
lowest band from a narrow plain zone above the podal supports.
Vessel 9. (Fig. 8 b) is completed from 13 sherds, with only two small
sherds missing. It is tempered with clay, bone and sand, with the
clay predominating; the paste is somewhat lumpy and the surfaces
irregular. It is a plain cylindrical jar with a wavy rim, to the extent
that the height varies from 12.4 to 13.5 cm. Diameters are 13.9 to 14.4
em. from the lip down through most of the body. The lower body
curves in to a small, mildly convex disc base which is 6.5 to 7 cm. in
diameter. The walls are thick, averaging 9 ram.; the base is 14 ram. in
thickness .The rim is thinned by an inner bevel and the lip is rounded.
Vessel 3 (Fig. 8 c) is a deep bowl with incurving rim and eonstricted orifice. It was reconstructed from 19 sherds which afforded
about two-thirds of the total Vessel. The paste is clay-grit tempered,

TEXAS

32

SOCIETY

firm with moderately smoothed but unpolished surfaces. The interior
surface has a crackled appearance. The vessel is 12.8 to 13.4 era. in
height. Diameters at the rim, as reconstructed, are 16 to 16.5 cm. and
at midbody are J_8 to 18.5 era. The walls average 8 mm. in thickness,
but vary considerably, from 7 to 9.5 ram. The base is convex and
there is no evidence of separate construction of a disc base; in fact,
the base is continuous with the side walls. The rim is thinned to a
slightly rounded lip, which has deep notches spaced at 8 ram. intervals. A perCoration, 3 era. below the lip, is drilled from the exterior;
the opposing sherd is missing.
4. OTHER APLASTICS Fifteen sherds have other aplasties or some
unusual combination of aplastics, most of which are probably accidental (Table 3). Three sherds are light in weight and have vacuoles
which presumably result from vegetal materials which burned out in
the firing process. Two of these sherds from the same vessel are deeorated with a vertica! band outlined by incised lines and bisected by
a row of punetations. Five sherds have numerous particles of coarse
gravel, mixed with sand or clay, or a sand-clay eolnbination. Four
sherds have ash or charcoal, along with clay, bone or sand in varying
amounts. One sherd has a combination of bone, clay, sand and burnedout fiber. Another sherd has clay, sand and crushed ocher. The final
sherd has sand, bone, gravel and crushed ocher. The last two sherds
described have large amounts of ocher, not the occasional stain seen
in the paste of many sherds. Except for the two decorated sherds all
others with unusual aplastics are plain body sherds.

B.

CERAI~Ics--POTTERY TYPES

In this section vessels or sherds will be assigned, where possible, to
known pottery types of the Lower Mississippi Valley and of eastern
and southeastern Texas. This can be done with certainty only for those
sherds which are decorated or have distinctive features relating to
form, lip treatment or basal segments. We shall then consider the
untyped sherds, especially the plain, as they appear to relate to the
ceramics of this area.
i.

TCHEFUNCTE PERIOD

TCHEFUNCTE PLAIN:
19 sherds are thought to be Tchefuncte
Plain, on the basis of paste characteristics, surface finish or shape. Six
of these are basal sherds which, in addition to consistent paste characteristics, have shapes which are confined to, or more frequent in,
Tehefuncte ceramics. Three have annular bases with ventral concavities and with extension up the outer wall (Fig. 1-0 f, g). A fourth
projects outward to form a flange base (Fig. 10 h). One has a mammi(a)

TIlE RESCI-I SITE

33

form podal support (Fig. 10i) and the final sherd is the disc base
(Fig. 10 j) with four downward projections which apparently joined
tetrapodal supports on the wall.
Additionally, we think that Vessel 3 (Fig. 8 e) fits Tehefunete Plain
type. The modified globular bowl shape, the constricted orifice, the
rounded and crudely notched lip and perforations are seen in this
type (Ford and Quimby, 1945, Fig. 17). The clay-grit paste and the
surface appearance is consistent, as is the vessel wall thickness and
generally crude manufacture. Flounded or convex bases were not
found often in the Lake Pontehartrain Tchefunete sites, but were
stated to be not uncommon at the Lafayette, La., mound (Ford and
Quimby, 1945).
(b) ALEXANDER PINCHED: One sherd, black and sand-tempered with
minimal clay particles, has the characteristic nail pinching (Fig. 10 e)
to produce a V-shaped or triangular design seen in this type (Ford
and Quimby 1945, Plate 7 p). This is of especial interest because typical designs of the Alexander series are rare this far west of the Mississippi.
(e) TCIIEFUNCTE STA~IPED, VARIETY I~ESCH: Vessel 1 (Fig. 8d, 9)
with the two additional sherds. This is a new subtype, agreed upon
after discussion of Vessel 1 at the 1966 Caddoan Conference in Natehitoehes, La. It was formerly included under Tehefunete Stamped Type
(Ford and Quimby 1945, Plate 2) and typical examples are illustrated
in this plate, b, e, e, f.
Paste-Method of Manufacture: Coiled, flattened coils 3 em. wide.
Tempering: Clay particles, smaller amounts of fine sand.
Texture: Fine clay paste with clay particles and some sand, with
poor wedging which gives some contortion. Occasionally homogeneous texture.
Hardness: Tends to be soft, averaging hardness of 2; soft when
damp and has little tensile strength.
Color: Various shades of gray to light buff on exterior; core usually
dark.
Surface Finish: Interior and exterior smoothed but not polished.
Thin coat of clay floated to surface tends to flake off or to have a
crackled appearance.
Decoration-Design: Triangular depressions stamped on vessel in
parallel rows over entire body surface. Arranged vertically, horizontally or diagonally in double row. I~ows may or may not be separated by one or two parallel lines that are incised with drag-and-jab
technique.
Technique: In the original Tchefuncte report, Ford and Quimby

and are unable to detect evidence of rocker-stamping. Rather, the

triangles seem to be individual impressions of a triangular tool, and
the intervening lines to have been made by the standard drag:and-jab
incising technique which is frequent in Tchefuncte Incised type.
Form-l~im: Usually excurvate with rounded marginal thickening
on the exterior.
Lip: Usually rounded. No notched specimens known.
Body: Deep pots with outward eurving rims; midbody straight or
slightly barreled. Possibly bowls.
Bases: Multiple teat-like podal supports on a flat disc base. Probably
other forms of wedge-leg and teat-leg, tetrapodal or polypodal, as for
Tchefuncte Plain and Tchefuncte Stamped.
Sizes: 17 era. height and diameters of approximately 10 em. at
base, 12 era. midbody and 15.5 em. at rim for only whole vessel.
Chronological Positions and Relationships: Occurs in Tehefunete
Period. Found in ceramics of this period in the Lower Mississippi
Valley, also 9,7 sherds at the Russell Landing Site on Catahoula Lake
in central Louisiana (Gibson 1968, Fig. 5 a and p. 28), Sabine River
drainage, East Texas, at the Iteseh Site. A similarly decorated ware
was found in Burke County, Georgia at the MeBean Creek Site, in
Deptford eontext (David S. Phelps, personal communication, 1966).
Fifteen sherds with a linear triangle stamping were found at this site
in 1965, 6 of the sherds from one vessel. In temper, paste and other
technological features, the sherds correspond to other Deptford
sherds. The only identified shape was the simple bowl. Phelps stated
"On a majority of the sherds, the application of the stamp is so careful
that it appears to be a multi-unit paddle; on a few, however, the lines
wander apart, attesting to the use of a single unit tool." One of these
sherds is shown in Fig. 8 e.
~,.

MARKSVILLE--TROYVILLE

PERIODS

PLAIN: 4 sherds from as many vessels seem to fit
the eharaeteristics of this type. There are two rim sherds (Fig. 10 q, r)
whieh are very similar, of smooth black paste, clay-tempered in one
instance, day and bone in the other, from bowls with incurvate and
unthickened rims. A third rim sherd is slightly thickened by an infolded strip of clay; it is dark gray, clay-tempered, with smooth exterior and rough interior surface. A basal sherd shows evidence of a
square base; it is clay-tempered, thick and has rough surfaces.
Vessel 2 (Fig. 8 b), which is day-and-bone-tempered, has the
cylindrical shape, thick wall, irregular orifiee, thin and rounded lip,
smoothed but lumpy surface and small vessel size, which are consistent with Marksville Plain. Our difficulty lies in the fact that none
of these eharaeteristies is diagnostic, that any of them may be present

in Woodward Plain-or, indeed, in any Baytown plain ceramics. Moreover, bone tempering is not described in Marksville Plain of the Mississippi Valley. The latter is no detelTent in East Texas, however, as
sherds of Troyville and Marksville Stamped types from the tlesch Site,
described below, are tempered with bone, sand and hematite, in addition to clay.

position and apparently formed panels. The paste is clay-grit, with
light gray exterior color and black interior.
(d) TnoYVILLE STA~{PED: 4 sherds, apparently from 3 vessels,
have zoned rocker-stamped decoration which was done with a curved
or straight bar tool (Fig. 10 k-n). The zones are outlined by deep Ushaped trailed lines, 4 to 5 ram. in width. One large sherd (Fig. 10 k)
is of clay-bone-tempered paste, with brown exterior and black interior
colors. Curvilinear lines outline narrow panels which are roughened
by curved rocker-stamping. A smaller grog-tempered sherd (Fig.
10 1) is uniformly buff colored. It has 3 curving trailed lines with
panels on each side, and the rocker-stamping is done with a small,
straight bar tool. Two sherds (Fig. 10 m, n) of black grog-tempered
paste with smooth surfaces may derive from the same small vessel.
One is a rim sherd, direct, with flat lip, a horizontal row of hemieonica!
punctations just below the rim and the beginning of a decorated
zone. The second sherd is from the wall at the base and shows curving
diagonal grooved lines outlining a panel of rocker-stamping done
also with a short, straight bar.
(0)

AâIAI~KSVILLE STAIK~IPED: 13 sherds from a minimum of 7 vessels

have the zoned, dentate rocker-stamping characteristic of this type
(Fig. 10 s-z). The deep U-shaped trailed lines which separate the
plain and stamped bands are 2.5 to 7 ram. in width and about 1 ram.
in depth. The stamping tools were 7 to 15 mm. in width and had 4
to 8 projections or "teeth." Four sherds were derived from a black,
clay-tempered vessel (Fig. 10 v) with globular body and probably
a cambered rim, on which there are at least 3 horizontal trailed lines.
The rocker-stamping roughens the background for curvilinear plain
bands; the stamping is regular and beautifully executed. Three sherds
from a larger vessel (Fig. 10 w) are clay-tempered with buff exterior
and black interior and core. The curvilinear bands are wide and are
outlined by shallow, wide U-shaped grooves; the stamping is regular
but rougher than on the first sherd. Two other sherds from different
vessels have similar wide, shallow grooves and large designs; one of
these is sand and grog-tempered, the other grog-tempered, with some
sand, bone and hematite (Fig. 10 u, z). A smaller sherd (Fig. 10 y)
has smooth grooves, 3.5 mm. wide, and well-executed rocker-stamping.
It is clay-tempered with buff exterior color and black interior. The
final two sherds (Fig. 10t, x) are from the basal portions of the
side walls, and one includes part of a circular base. The zoning lines
are narrow and the zones are smal!, as are the stamp patterns (7-8
ram. ). Both are clay-tempered, one with brown exterior and buff interior, the other with buff exterior and black interior colors.

COLES

CREEK PERIOD

(Fig. 11 a-j).

There are 18 sherds from an estimated 15 vessels which are recognizably from Coles Creek types. As is true of Tchefuncte, Marksville
and Troyville sherds, it is probable that other sherds are from vessels
of this period. Uncertain and questionable specimens were omitted.
(a) COLES CREEK PLAIN: 6 sherds, 4 of which are derived from
rims and 2 from body walls, are of this type. One rim is direct, with
externally beveled lip, smooth interior and polished exterior surfaces.
It has firm paste and is clay-tempered with a small amount of sand
and bone particles. A second rim is direct, with a lip which is flattened
to overhang both exterior and interior walls (Fig. 11 j). The paste is
firm and clay-tempered, and the surfaces are smooth but unpolished.
The third rim sherd is large, about 1/5 of the vessel circumference,
and incurves to a constricted orifice; it is clay-tempered with hematite
nodules, and the surfaces are smooth. The fourth rim incorporates the

THE

RESCH

SITE

angle of an eared bowl (Fig. 11 h); it is dark brown to black in color,
and tempered with clay, bone, sand and hematite. The two body
sherds are buff to brown in co!or, clay-tempered and firm. One is
thin, with smoothed exterior and rough interior surfaces; the other
has a polished interior and a curvature which suggests a flat bowl
shape.
(b) CREENHOUSE INCISED: 1 sherd of this type (Fig. 11 i) has a
wide, externally folded rim which forms a graceful camber, below
which is a single wide trailed line. The rim is incurvate to a constricted
orifice and the lip is rounded. The sherd is elay-tenapered, black on
the interior and camber, light gray on the exterior wall; the inner surface is smooth, the outer is polished.
(C) COLES CREEK INCISED: There are 11 sherds of this type, 4 of
which are rim sherds. Four sherds are from the same vessel (Fig.
11 a), and 3 are fitted to produce 3~ of an excurvate rim with narrow,
externally rolled and rounded lip. Five parallel horizontal incised
lines encircle the external rim area. The fourth sherd from this vessel
(Fig. 11 f) suggests an undecorated sub-globular body which is separated from the rim area by a broad trailed depression. The paste is
soft, with clay, bone, sand and hematite temper; the exterior surface
color is light gray to brown, and the interior is black. Three other
rim sherds of this type have 2 to 3 horizontal incised lines encircling
the direct rims (Fig. 11 b-d). One has a thin flattened lip, and the
others are rounded. Two are clay-grit-tempered and the third is
bone-grit-tempered. Surface colors are brown to black. The 4 remaining sherds of this type (Fig. 11 e, g) have one to three smooth and
firm!y incised lines on the wall exteriors. Three of these sherds have
smooth to polished extel~or and interior surfaces, with buff to dark
gray coloration; they vary from 5 to 7 ram. in thickness. Tempering is
with clay in two instances, clay-grit-bone in the third. The fourth
sherd has rougher surfaces because of sand-tempering. The exterior
is gray in color; the interior is black. The incising, however, seems
quite consistent with Coles Creek Incised type.
4. CADDOAN PERIOD (Fig. 11 k-co).
There are 81 sherds from an estimated 49. vessels which fall into
established Caddoan types or, in the instance of plain sherds, are compatible with vessel shapes or paste charactm~sties of the Caddoan
periods.
(a) HICKORY ENCRAVED: There are 6 certain and 9 possible sherds
of this type, all clay-tempered. Four bottle spout rim sherds (Fig. 11
l-n) and 9. sherds of bottle shoulder area (Fig. 11 r, s) have the encircling engraved lines typical of this type. Additionally there are 9 plain

40

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

spout sherds. From one vessel (Fig. 11 k), there are 8 sherds which
are thick and form the tapered spout that is typical of the Alto
ceramics.

(b) DAVIS INCISED: 11 sherds (Fig. llo-q, w) have smooth incised horizontal lines. Six of them are from open carinated bowls,
3 from jar forms with tall vertical rims, and 9. from vessels of uncertain
shape. The vessel forms, paste characteristics (3 bone and 8 claytempered), and incising technique have more similarity to this type
than to Coles Creek Incised.
(c) PEASE B~usrrED-INCISED: One bone-tempered sherd (Fig. 11 t )
has brushed fields separated by a vertical band of punctuations.
(d) PINELAND PUNCTATED-INCISED (Jelks, 1965) : 3 sherds, apparently derived from the same vessel, have a band on the upper body
decorated with alternating fields of para!lel diagonal incised lines and
punctate-filled triangles (Fig. 11 y, z). They are bone-tempered with
some salad.

(e) BI~OADDUS BRUSrIED (Jelks 1965) : 7 sherds, all bone-tempered
and reddish-buff in color, have brushed roughening of the external surfaces (Fig. 11 aa-cc). The brushing is vertical on 4 sherds, diagonal
on one, and in two different directions on the other two, which apparently derive from the same vessel. These sherds seem to fit the description of Broaddus Brushed type more nearly than that of Karnack
Brushed-Incised type.
(f) DIACONAL INCISED I~IM SI~RDS: 3 sherds (Fig. llu, v) from
two sand-tempered vessels are parts of outflaring rims which were
broken at the rim-body junction. They are decorated with alternating
bands of right and left sloping diagonal lines which have undecorated
triangles between the fields of incisions. The incised lines are made
with a notched or two-pronged tool, so that each incision is double,
with 1 mm. distance between the lines. The vessel shape and decoration arrangement are similar to Pineland Punctated-Ineised type,
which sometimes is sand-tempered.
(g) PLAIN SrIERDS: 42 sherds seem to derive from the bodies of
bottles, carinated bowls and jars, which have typical Caddoan shapes.
There are two rim sherds of open earinated bowls: one black in color
and clay-tempered, the other (Fig. 11 x) reddish-buff, bone-tempered,
and with diagonal notches across the lip of an otherwise undecorated
narrow rim. Seven sherds derive from sherd-tempered bowls, made of
soft, reddish paste which is similar to that of some of the Davis Incised
sherds. Some of these sherds may derive from the Davis vessels, but
two have undecorated rims. Of the remaining 33 sherds; 9 are polished, black clay-tempered sherds which appear to come from bottles

THE

and bowls (3 or 4 possibly derive from the same vessel); 5 are body
sherds from a large plain bottle of brown clay-tempered ware; and
the remaining 12 (1 bone-tempered and 11 clay-tempered) are from
diverse vessels, which are thin and have paste characteristics or indicated shapes of Caddoan vessels.
5. UNTYPED POTTERY SHEIqDS

Extraction of the above identified pottery sherds leaves a large
mass of unidentified sherds as follows: 348 sand-tempered or predominantly sand-tempered sherds, of which 14 are decorated and 21
are plain rim sherds, (2 of the latter are notched); 557 bone-tempered
sherds, of which 38 form Vessel 4, 19 are decorated and 18 are plain
rim sherds, one of which has diagonal notching; 418 clay-tempered
sherds, of which 11 are decorated and 36 are plain rim sherds, one of
which is notched. Out of these there are 5 aggregations of sherds
which deserve special attention because they can be assembled to the
point of giving a good indication of size, shape and/or decoration.
(a) VESSEL 4 AND 16 additional sherds are bone-tempered and
decorated with deeply trailed incised lines. Vessel 4 (Fig. 8 a) is a
large deep urn of "flower pot" shape, heavily bone-tempered, with
orange to red-brown surface color, except for small areas of black
hâom irregular firing. It measures 25-26 era. in height, 23-24 era. in
orifice diameter and 9.5 cm. in diameter of the fiat disc base. The lips
are flat, 7 ram. in thickness, the body walls are 8-9.5 ram. thick and the
base is 14 ram. thick. The decorated rim is set off from the body by
two parallel and horizontal deeply trailed lines, 1 cm. apart, and the
decorated rim is 7 cm. high. The decoration is effeeted with trailed
lines and punctations, the lines 2.5 to 3 mm. wide and 1-1.5 ram.
deep. The punctations were done with a serrated tool. There are 14
decorative units around the rim, each a triangular area, alternately
upright or pendant, filled with 4 to 6 diagonal lines each, except for
the left angle of the base, which has a punctate-filled small triangular
or semilunar area.
The 13 additional bone-tempered sherds have combinations of similar deep trailing. They are 7 to 9 ram. thick and most of the bone
temper has been dissolved, leaving vacuoles (Fig. 7 a-e). There are
no rim sherds and it is impossible to judge the vessel shape, although
the curvatures suggest diameters similar to or slightly smaller than
Vessel 4. Three other sherds have a like kind of trailing, but arranged
in curvilinear patterns (Fig. 7 i-l).
In many respects, Vessel 4 and this group of sherds resemble Canton
Incised type (Texas Handbook, 1962:23), because of the shape, the
band of decoration around the rfln, the combination of incised di-

42

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

agonal lines and punctations, and of varyingly directed lines. They
differ, however, in that Canton Incised is most often clay-grit-tempered, with bone sometimes added, whereas all of the tlesch sherds
of this type are bone-tempered. More important is the incising and
punctating with a pointed tool in Canton, whereas the Resch sherds
are heavily and deeply trailed, very similar to the trailing of the Marksville sherds at this site. Another consideration as to typology is Pineland Punctated-Incised (Jetks 1965) of the McGee Bend ceramics,
which has similar urn shapes and vessel sizes, but the same objections
prevail. It seems probable that this bone-tempered ineised-punetated
ware at Itesch is older than Canton and Pineland types and ancestral
to them; we therefore suggest the tentative type Canton Incised,
variety darco, for this ware.
(b) The vessel represented by the 4 sand-tempered sherds of
Fig. 6 g, h is of considerable interest. This is a small jar, apparently
smaller than Vessel 2, with thick walls (8-11 mm.) and flat lip. The
profile shows an indentation below the rim, with recurved walls, so
that the size and shape are quite consistent with Marksville pottery.
The decoration is unlike anything in Caddoan ceramics and its nearest
comparison is with Marksvilte Incised at the Crooks Site (Ford and
Willey, 1940 Fig. 35 e), in which varying combinations of concentric
circles, rectangles, diamonds and other rectilinear and curvilinear
motifs appear. The rim punctations in the tleseh vessel are nail
executed instead of hemiconical tool punctations, and the incised
lines are somewhat rougher; the sandy paste has a different texture
and feel from Marksville ceramics, including the Marksville Stamped
sherds at Besch. Some of the latter, however, have the same brown
eolor as this vessel and have more sand in the paste than is usual in
the Mississippi Valley. We suspect, therefore, that this vessel is an
East Texas variant, in sand-tempered paste, of Marksville Incised type.
(c) The 14 plain sherds which seem to derive from one vessel
were described under sand-tempered pottery. They show no other
tempering material, are ahnost sandstone-like in gritty consistency, and
the vessel form suggested by the six sherds which fit together is an
open vase with flat or slightly convex base ( Fig. 6 b ). The size appears
to be about that of Vessel 2. Other sherds, including 6 direct or
slightly incurving rims (Fig. 6 i) are similar. This ware is probably
related to or identical with Bockport Plain of the Texas Coast or Bear
Creek Plain of the Brookeland Focus in McGee Bend area (Jelks

1965).
(d) A group of 40 plain sherds, S of which are rim sherds comes
from 2 or 3 similar large vessels. Thirty of these have been fitted to-

THE

RESCH

SITE

43

gether into 3 vessels segments (Fig. 6 a, c, d). This is dark brown to
black sand-bone-hematite pottery which we call "ironware." The
vessel form is a "flowerpot" vase or deep bowl similar to vessel 4. It is
larger and has a wider orifice that is estimated to be 30-35 cm. in
diameter.
(e) Another large group of plain bone-tempered sherds, 12-15 of
which come fiâom one vessel, seems to derive from vessel forms very
similar to the above group and to Vessel 4. A much smaller group
of preponderantly clay-tempered plain sherds, including some rim
sherds, probably represents similar large vessels of open vase form.
Many of these sherds have a mixture of tempering materials, more
often bone and grit, but additional amounts of crushed sherd or clay
particles and hematite or ocher are not infrequent.
Among the remaining plain sherds, judging especially from rims,
smaller cylindrical jars like Vessel 2, deep bowls and wider bowls with
incurvate rims and constricted orifices, like Vessel 3 are indicated.
These include sherds of all three major tempering characteristics,
some with multiple temper. The majority of these vessels have relatively thick walls, in the 7 to 9 ram. range. The rims are typically
unaltered, except for occasional thinning, and the lips are most often
rounded but are fiat in some instances, with occasional notching. The
afiqliation of most of these plain, thick-walled vessels of groups d and e
is probably with Woodward Plain type.
Some of the plain sherds undoubtedly derive from the undecorated
portions of decorated vessels, but the large proportion of plain rims
indicates that many of the vessels were plain. Some of the thinner
sherds, especially in the clay-tempered plain, possibly represent vessels
from the Co/es Creek and Caddoan periods, but do not have paste
characteristics by which this can be determined with certainty.
Untyped Decorated Sherds: There are 23 untyped decorated
sherds, 9 with sandy paste, 3 bone-tempered and 11 clay-tempered.
Six small sandy sherds are from one incised vessel (Fig. 6 k). Eight
others, mostly small fragments, have incisions. Three bone-tempered
(Fig. 7 f-h) and 2 clay-tempered (Fig. 7 r) sherds are thick and have
random punctations, 3 with the fingernail and 2 with tools. They
resemble Wilkinson Punctated type of Louisiana and East Texas.
Two thinner sherds have small tool punetations which seem to be
random, but the sherds are small. The final two sherds (Fig. 7 t) from
the same vessel are light and porous, as though tempered with vegetal
matter which fired out. They have a decoration of vertical incised
bands centered by a line of punctation.

C. OTHER CLAY OBJECTS.

Objects of clay, other than ceramics, are extremely rare. There
are 5 small fragments of daub, which have impressions of twigs or
grass on the surfaces. There is one small object of pinkish clay with
smooth surfaces, 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm., with trapezoidal cross-section.
Finally, there are 5 pieces of mud-dauber nests of sandy clay.
D.

PROJECTILE POINTS

There are 512 projectile points from this site, all but two derived
from the excavations. Of this group, 464 are considered to be dart
points, 48 arrow points and one lance point. The outstanding characteristics of the projectiles are: relatively small size, poor quality of
manufacture, and preponderant use of local materials. Of the dart
points 195 (42.0377), and of the arrow points, 15 (31.9.57o) were made
of petrified wood; 208 (44.8377) of the dart points and 9.9 (60.4277) of
the arrow points were made from local cherts which are largely tan,
red, brown and gray pebble cherts. Only 61 (13.147o) of the dart
points and 4 (8.337o) of the arrow points were made from materials
which seem to be foreign to the area. Of these, 19 are novaculites
and quartzites, probably from the Hot Springs, Arkansas locality. A
mottled dark flint and several shades of light gray waxy chert, both
thought to derive from central Texas, are next in frequency of materials presumed to be exotic in origin. Others are in small numbers
and the source is uncertain. Thirty-seven of the dart points are broken
in a way that prevents typing.
i.

DART PROJECTILE

POINTS

(a) CABY TYPE: The Gary type (Fig. 12) makes up the majority
of the dart points, 9â76 (64.637o) of the 49.7 typed points. In size, 9.9 of
these are Gary Typical (Ford and Webb 1956), 4.6 to 6.6 era. in
length, 1.7 to 3.7 era. in width and 7.3 and 19. ram. thick. Of the Gary
Typical, 19 were made of petrified wood, 6 of tan and 9â of brown local
cherts, 1 of white flint and 1 of white quartzite. Some 169â are Gary
Small, with lengths between 3.1 and 4.5 era., widths from 1.3 to 3.4 cm.,
and thicknesses from 6 to !3 ram. Of the Gary Small, 65 were made of
petrified wood; 61 of tan, 15 of red-brown and 4 of gray local cherts.
Seventeen Gary Small were made of foreign materials; 9â of white
chert, 1 of black chert, 3 of mottled gray glint, 5 of lighter waxy flint
and 6 of quartzites. There are 6 tiny Garys which, following MacNeish
(1967), we have called GmTito. These are 9â.1 to 3 em. in length,
1.1 to 9â.9 era. in width and 4 to 9.3 mm. in thickness. Only 19â of the
66 were made of petrified wood, in comparison with 35 of tan chert,
10 of gray chert, and one of hematite. Eight are of foreign materials,

5 of quartzite, 2 of light cream chert and 1 of Central Texas gray
chert. Of the Gary points, 19 are broken to the extent that nieasurements of length can not be obtained; 11 of these are of petrified wood,
4 of tan, 1 of cream and 9. of gray local cherts, and 1 of novaeulite.
Contracting stem points constitute the major projectile point shape
in Late Archaic and early pottery complexes in East Texas and northern Louisiana. Distribution studies at the Yarbrough and Miller sites
(Johnson 1969,) indicated a progressive shift during the Archaic
period from side-notched and expanded-base traditions to straight
stems and, in Late Archaic times, to the contracting stem tradition.
The latter has been expressed in types Gary, Wells, Desmuke and, to
some extent, in sub-varieties of Kent and the new type, Woden, introduced by Jelks (1965) in describing the McGee Bend material. A
tendency for Gary type points to diminish in size with the passage of
time was described by Baerreis (1951) for the preeeramic cultures
of Eastern Oklahoma and by Ford and Webb (1956) for northern
Louisiana. More recently, attention has been directed to the overall
morphology of Gary points, as reviewed by MeClurkan in a recent
publication (1968). A number of varieties or subtypes were established by Duffleld (1961) at the Limerick Site, by Johnson (1962)
at Yarbrough and Miller Sites, by Ross (1966) at the Forney l~eservoir Sites, by Sorrow (1966) from Bardwell l~eservoir, and by McClurkan (1968) from Livingston Reservoir Sites. All of the above
sites are in eastern or north central Texas. These authors recognized
seven to fifteen varieties of Gary type from the sites or areas which
they studied. Story (1965) used the Johnson classification in description of artifacts from the Cedar Creek Reservoir, which is in the
Trinity River drainage of East Texas and west of the l:(esch Site.
Table 4 shows the frequency of Johnsonâs varieties of Gary type at
the t~esch Site. We have chosen his classification because the Yarbrough Site is in the same drainage system as the l~esch Site and
because the application of variety names makes for easier comparisons.
The kaufman variety (Fig. 12 a-h) was popular at the l~esch Site, with
a total of 47, or 17.037o of all Gary points. Ten of the 27 Gary Typical
(between 5 and 8 cm. in length) are of this variety, whereas only
4 of the tiny Garys are. This corresponds with the observation elsewhere that kaufman tends to be larger than other varieties of Gary
type in East Texas. It is characterized by wide triangular blades,
distinct shoulders and triangular, pointed stems.
The alsa variety, another larger point with triangular blade but with
wider stems and indistinct shoulders, and the similar but smaller
kenedg variety are missing at the Resch Site. The hobson variety (Fig.

12 i-n) tends to be small. Five of the 11 specimens are Garyito or tiny
Garys and 5 are small Garys, between 3.1 and 4.5 era. in length. These
have wide, rounded stems and are rather well made.
The emory variety of Gary point (Fig. 12 o, t, v, w) is the most
numerous at Resch Site, with a total of 96 points (34.78~o of all Gary
points). Thirty-three of the emory variety are tiny Garys (less than
3 cm. in length), 57 are Gary Small and only 4 are GalT Typical.
Emory variety tends to be slender, with a contracting stem which has
a straight instead of pointed base. There are distinct shoulders (Fig.
12 o, p, s, v, w) on 46 of the emory variety, while 50 are more slender,
with only a suggestion of a shoulder. This trait is especially pronounced in the Garyito size. Johnsonâs illustration from the Yarbrough
Site (Johnson 1962, Fig. 4) also demonstrates narrower and wider
forms in this variety.
The runge variety, with long narrow stems and short blades (Fig.
12x-aa), is represented by 11 specimens at Resch: one tiny, 7 small
and 1 typical size, with 2 broken. The parma maria variety is even
less numerous, only 6 specimens. Two of these are small and 4
typical in size. They tend to be rough, thick, with indistinct and
slender outline (Fig. 12 bb).
The kemp variety (Fig. 12 cc-ii) is second in frequency among the
Gary points from t~esch, a total of 67 (24.27~). Twenty-two of these
are tiny, 39 are Gary Small, and 6 are Gary Typical. These are slender
points, better made than most of the Gary varieties, with long triangular blade and triangular pointed stem. There is the same dichotomy as in emory variety between specimens with slightly wider
blades and distinct shoulders, and specimens with narrower blades

48

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

and barely discernible shoulders. Thirty-eight of kemp variety have
distinct shoulders (Fig. 12 co, ff-hh) and 29 have indistinct.
The colfax variety (Fig. 12 jj-nn) is represented by 18 specimens,
only two of which are tiny Garys; most of the specimens are Gary
Small in size. They have comparatively short blades, the edges of
which are generally convex instead of straight. The stems tend to be
nearer straight-sided than most Gary points, although rounded at
the base. Except for the tendency to small size, this variety is easily
confused with the quinlan variety of Kent type, as shown in Johnsonâs
(1962) Fig. 5 i, j.
Twenty Gary points from this site do not fall into any of these
varieties. Twelve (Fig. 12 pp) are similar to als(l variety, having wide
triangular blades with rough chipping, but the stems differ in being
narrow and short, ahnost "nubbin" like in size. All of these are small.
Two points are modified leaf-shaped (Fig. 12u) with convex edge
blades and gracefully rounded stems. The remainder are nondescript,
and several are altered by breakage.
(b) WELLS TYPE: Only 5 projectiles are classified as Wells type
(Fig. 13 a-c) using the major criterion that the contracting stems
constitute 55 to 6770 of the total point length. They are 3 to 4.3 cm. in
length, 1.6 to 2.6 era. in width and 8-9 ram. in thickness (smaller than
listed in the Suhm and Jelks (1962) Handbook, as are most of the
projectiles from this site). Four are fairly well made, one rough. The
materials from which they were manufactured are: one each from
local gray chert, light gray Central Texas chert, sandy quartzite, petrified wood and waxy gray flint. Two points are distinctive in having
relatively long stems and very short, small isosceles triangular blades
(Fig. 13 b).
(C) DESlVIUKE TYPE: There are 6 points which we classify as
Desmuke type (Fig. 13 d-f) with some hesitation, because it appears
that the lozenge-shaped projectile points which occur from Oklahoma
and East Texas across northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas to
the MississiDpi Valley, although internally consistent and closely
resembling Desmuke points, do not equate in all respects with the
Desmuke point which was described (Suhm and Krieger 1954; Suhm
and Jelks 1969,) from southwestern Texas. The bases tend to be relatively longer and the blade edges are more often mildly convex than
in the original descriptions. If anyone would Drefer to classify our
specimens as a variety of Gary point, we would have no quarrel. The
senior author has noted, at a number of sites in northern Louisiana
and especially at the Poverty Point site and other sites of this complex, that Gary points are often of foreign materials, especially novacu-

lite and quartzites from the Hot Springs area. At these same sites the
lozenge-shaped Desmuke-like points share this use of quartzites,
indicating that this point is a companion or variant of the Gary type.
The 6 Desmuke points are 3.4 to 4.4 cm. in length, 2 to 2.8 era. in
width and 8-12 mm. thick. They are slightly crude, with large flake
scars and minimal edge retouch; 4 show central longitudinal ridges
on one or both faces. Different materials are represented by 3 points of
local buff, tan or red chert, one of petrified wood, one of novaculite
and one of brown foreign chert.
(d) KENT TYPE: 42 projectile points (9.83% of the dart points)
are classified as Kent (Fig. 13 j-l), which is third in frequency at the
site. Of these, 38 are slender in outline, while 9 are of moderate width
in proportion to length. Most show evidences of carelessness in manufacture, with large flake scars, minimal edge retouch, asymmetrical
stems or shoulders, and often with thick ridges on one face. Half of
them show residual cortex at the base or on the faces. The lengths vary
from 3 to 5.7 cm., the widths from 1.6 to 3 cm., and the thicknesses
fiâom 6.5 to 19..4 ram. Almost all are made of local materials, petrified wood in 26 instances, tan or gray local chert in 14. The two possibly foreign materials represented are one point of black and one of
reddish chert.
(e) ELAZV~ TYPE: 8 specimens (Fig. 13 g-i) are small, short and
stubby in outline, with triangular blades and square or rectangular
stems. Four of these have distinct shoulders and in outline are similar
to Carrollton type, but their small size and the absence of smooth
stem edges fit better into the Elam type. Three of the points show
some smoothing of the stem bases. They range from 3 to 3.8 cm. in
length, from 1.9 to 9..6 cm. in width and are 6.5 to 9 ram. thick. Materials are petrified wood in four instances, local cream, gray or tan
chert in three, and Central Texas gray mottled chert in one.
(~) PALMILLAS TYPE: 16 specimens (Fig. 13 m-o), 4 of which are
moderately short and wide, while the other 12 tend to be slender.
They are more carefully made than the Kent points, averaging about
like the Gary type, with edge retouch on most blades. The production of the bulbous stem resulted in distinct, usually squared shoulders, without barbs. Lengths vary from 3.7 to 6.5 cm., widths are 1.8
to 2.8 cm., and thicknesses 6 to 11 ram. Materials are mostly local:
petrified wood in 8, tan chert in 4, brown and gray chert in one each.
A white chert and a gray quartzite may be from Arkansas.
(g) YAItBI:IOUGH TYPE:
15
specimens (Fig. 13 x-aa) are subdivided into varieties as outlined by Johnson (1962). All are slender
points with long triangular blades, with straight or mildly convex

THE RESCH SITE

edges and with mildly expanding or ahnost straight stems. Moderate
shoulders were produced by the long, curving notches; no barbs are
present. The stems show smoothing of the edges and bases in most
instances, but this is less evident in those points made of petrified
wood. Several of the Yarbrough points are very well made (Fig. 13 x),
but most exhibit only average technology, about like the Palmillas and
Gary points at this site.
Yarbrough type, dike variety: 3 specimens (Fig. 13x-z). These
are the largest of the Yarbrough type from this site. They are 5.3 to
6.3 cm. in length, 2.1 to 9..6 em. in width and 7.5 to 9 ram. in thickness. The stem edges are distinctly concave and the bases straight.
Stem edges and bases are ground smooth. Materials are petrified
wood, buff local chert and Central Texas mottled waxy chert.
Yarbrough type, lindale variety: 11 specimens. These are smaller
in size and more slender in outline. Five are broken and the remainder
vary from 3.5 to 4.8 em. in length, 1.8 to 2.5 cm. in width, and 8 to
10 mm. in thickness. They are not as well made as the dike variety, and
in 4 of the 11 specimens stem smoothing is not manifest. The stem
expansion is less than in the dike variety, with strong concavity only
at the upper part of the notch, so that some stems are almost straight.
The latter could be confused with Kent points and are separated on
the basis of general outline or stem smoothing. Materials are petrified wood in 8 instances, light gray or tan local chert in two, and gray
siltstone in one.
Yarbrough type, mabank variety: one specimen (Fig. 13 aa). This
point of local tan chert has the typical concave edge and concave base
of this variety, although the stem is straighter than usual. Stem edges
and base are well ground. The tip is broken, but the probable length
is 4.5 cm., the width 2.2 em. and thickness 7.5 mm.
(h) YANTIS TYPE: 9, specimens fit the type Yantis (Fig. 13p, q),
as established by Johnson (1962) at the Yarbrough Site. They are
large and crude, both broken across the blade, and are characterized
additionally by wide concave side or corner notching and straight
bases, with slight stem edge smoothing. One seems to fit the cook
variety of Yantis; the concave notches expand to produce a wide,
straight base. It is made of pehâified wood. The second appears to be
a swan variety of Yantis, with wide blade, deep concave notches and
a straight base. It is made of a dull red petrified wood. The stem sides
and bases of both specimens are smoothed.
(i) ELLIS TYPE (Fig. 13 r-w): 45 specimens represent 10.54% of
the typed dart points, making this type second in frequency at the
site, after Gary. About ~ of the specimens are nicely worked, the

52

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

remainder rather crude. They have about the appearance of most
points of this type from east Texas and northwestern Louisiana: a
slightly small and stubby projectile, with distinct, usually squared
shoulders, rarely barbed (3 of the 44 at this site), with corner notching which produced expanded stems. The stem bases are most often
straight, oecasiona!ly slightly convex or, less often, concave. Ten
points are broken. Of the remainder, 7 are more slender than is usual
for this type. The range of length is 9,.6 to 4.4 cm., the width 1.5 to
9..9 em., the thickness 4.6 to 11 mm. The consistency of size is indicated by the fact that 26 of the 35 intact points are between 3 and 4
cm. in length. One specimen with typical stem and lower blade has
been resharpened to form a hafted scraper. Most of the materials
from which these points were made are loeah 13 of petrified wood,
20 of tan chert, 6 of red, brown or gray local cherts. Exotic materials
include 1 of novaeulite, 2 of mottled Central Texas gray chert, and 3
of gray flint of unknown source .
(j) BULVEItDE TYPE: One well-made point of greenish-gray flint,
possibly of Central Texas origin, seems to be typical Bulverde type
(Fig. 14 bb). The length is 6.2 era., the width 3.9 era. and the thickness 10 ram. The blade is a straight-sided triangle; the shoulders
are squared without barbs, and the stem is rectangular and wedgeshaped in profile.
(k) DELHI TYPE: One beautifully flaked and symmetrically made
large projectile is of the type known from the Poverty Point culture
(Ford and Webb 1956) as Delhi (Fig. 14 aa). It is made of a waxy
black flint, possibly Webbers Falls argillite. The b!ade is long and
leaf-shaped, with fine retouch flaking along the edges, ending in
short barbs at the shoulders. The stem is slightly expanded, almost
rectangular, with a straight and thinned base. The stem edges and
base are smoothed. It is 9.6 cm. long, 9..8 cm. wide at the shoulders,
and only 7 ram. in maximum thickness.
(1) SINNER TYPE (Fig. 14 y): One small slender point of tan
chert is of the type which ttiram Gregory and the senior author have
called Sinner type. It is related to the Evans type, a larger point with
a single deep notch in the side of the blade, found in Arkansas and
northern Louisiana in Late Archaic context (Ford and Webb 1956;
Bell 1958:24). The Sinner type has multiple deep notches in the lower
blade edges, numbering 9. to 5, and often varying in number on the
two edges of a single point. Bases are squared to slightly expanded.
The point is generally slender and often rough. The specimen from
this site (Fig. 14 y) meets all of these criteria; there are three notches
in one blade margin, none or possibly one (broken) on the other;

the stem is square and asymmetrica!, and the workmanship is poor.
Dimensions are: length 4.5 cm.; width 1.7 cm.; thickness 9 ram.
(m) TRINITY TYPE: 1 broken point (Fig. 13 ce) has the stem and
lower blade which show the characteristic high shallow side notches
that produce a wide bulbous stem. It is made of an exotic gray "flint.
The width is 2.1 cm., the length is not known.
(n) UNTYPED POINTS: There are 8 entire or ahnost whole points
that do not fit established types with certainty and will be described.
Additionally there are 37 broken points or fiâagments in which the
breakage prevents typing. The latter include 16 of petrified wood, 9
of tan chert, 4 of novaculite or quartzites which probably derived
from the Arkansas Ozarks, one of white chert, and 7 of light or dark
gray waxy cherts or flints that are probably of Central Texas origin.
Three small and slender points (Fig. 14 cc, dd) are similar to the
Bradley and Flint River spikes described in Alabama (DeJarnette,
Kurjack and Cambron 1962). They are slender leaf-shaped, with
barely discernible basal narrowing and straight bases; they do not
have the appearance of drills. Two are made of black and reddishbrown petrified wood. The third is a speckled gray flint from Central
Texas and is small lanceolate (Fig. 14 cc) in outline, but the edges
and base are not ground.
Three points of petrified wood (Fig. 14 x) are small and have wide,
leaf-shaped blades with carefully worked, smal! projecting tips; weak
shoulders and square stems with straight bases. They are 3.2 to 4.3
cm. in length, 2.1 to 2.7 cnI. in width and 4 to 8.5 ram. in thickness.
One point of petrified wood has the square stem and deep basal
notches to produce long, sweeping barbs that are characteristic of
Marshall type (Fig. 13 bb). The blade is properly wide, with barbed
shoulders, but the point is much thinner than usual for this type (4.4
ram.) and the blade has been worked into an end scraper.
A large point (Fig. 14 z) made of granular quartzite ("sugar
quartz"), with wide leaf shape, has weak shoulders and either a
narrow straight stem or a contracting stem. It may be Gary or Yantis
type. The uncertainty exists because of a diagonal break across one
shoulder.
An interesting fragment is the snapped-off basal segment of a
concave-base point (Fig. 13 dd) of light gray waxy chert. It has the
appearance of a lanceolate point base, with smooth base and edges,
and with thinning of the concave base but no fluting.
2. POSSIBLE LANCE PROJECTILE POINT

There is one long projectile point (Fig. 14 ee) that is difficult to
classify. It is a slender bayonet-shaped point of petrified wood, with

THE

RESCH

SITE

55

a rough and asymmetrical stem, a sharp tip, roughly finished edges
and smoothly rounded unridged faces. It is 12.3 cm. long, 2.2 cm. wide
at the shoulder, and 9 to 11 ram. thick. The stem is 1.8 to 2.2 cm. long.
O.

ARROW PROJECTILE POINTS

There are 48 whole or fragmentary small and thin points that are
classified as arrow projectile points. Although nearly half of them had
tips or barbs broken off, all but four could be typed satisfactorily.
(a) FI:~ILEY TYPE: 29. specimens (Fig. 14a-h) make up exactly
half of the typed arrow points. These are fragile points, and 13 of the
9.9. were broken somewhere, usually at the outward or upward projetting barb. Ten of the specimens have the unique characteristic of
an upward projecting barb from one or both shoulders. Four otherwise typical points have barbs that project straight out from the
shoulder, and in the remainder the barbs are broken off. Stems are
expanded in 11 instances, rectangular in 9 and uncertain in the remainder. Blades are serrated in 19. instances and relatively smooth in
the others. Lengths range from 19. to 28 mm., widths from 19. to 17
mm., and thicknesses from 9. to 4 mm. Eleven of the points were made
of petrified wood, 11 of tan, red and gray local cherts.
(b) COLBERT TYPE (Fig. 14 q-u): 10 of the arrow points are of
Colbert type (Webb 1963). These points are related to Seallorn type
but have shorter and relatively wider blades, often with concave edges
to produce a flare above the shoulder. The low corner notching produced expanded, often slightly bulbous, stems and straight or mildly
barbed shoulders. Lengths vary from 14 to 31 ram., widths from 12 to
19 mm., and thicknesses from 9..8 to 4.6 ram. Two of these points are
of petrified wood, 7 of local tan and red cherts, and one of quartzite.
(c) ALBA TYPE (Fig. 14 i-k): 3 points, two of local tan and one
of green waxy chert, are of Alba type. They are symmetrical and wellmade, with straight-sided triangular blades and rectangular stems:
shoulders are straight and unbarbed. Lengths vary from 20 to 30 ram.,
widths from 19. to 18 ram., and thicknesses from 4 to 5 mm.
(d) BONHAM TYPE (Fig. 14 1, m): 3 specimens made of tan,
cream and gray waxy cherts resemble the Alba points, but the smaller
size and narrow rectangular stems place them into Bonham type.
Lengths are from 9.3 to 9.5 ram., widths from 11 to 17 ram., and thicknesses are 3.6 to 4 ram.
(e) CLn~FTON TYPE (Fig. 14 n, o): 9. specimens, of tan and red
local cherts, have the typica! triangular blades and short, poorly developed, rounded stems of this type. They are 9.9. and 9.3 mm. in
length, 17 and 18 ram. in width, and 4.5 and 5 ram. in thickness. One
differs in having a projecting shoulder on one side.

CATAHOULA

TYPE (Fig. 14 p): 2 specimens made of re:l

jasper and tan chert have the synnnetrical shape, recurred blade

They are the most carefully made of the arrow points from this site.
The larger point is 40 mm. in length, 23 mm. wide, and 4.5 mm.
thick. The smaller one, which has a broken tip, is 20 ram. wide and 3
ram. thick.

thicker and shorter than is usual for this type. One of petrified wood
is 30 ram. long, 14 ram. wide and 6 ram. thick. The other, of gray lint,
is 9.3 ram. long, 14 mm. wide and 7.5 ram. thick.
There are 4 broken and untyped arrow points, probably Friley type.
Three were made of local gray, tan and red cherts; one of petrified
wood.

E.

CHIPPED STONE

TOOLS

The difficulties which the classifier faces with chipped stone tools
from East Texas sites have been recounted by Story (1965), Johnson
(1962), Jelks (1965) and others. Our experience is no different. At the
l~esch Site these objects are numerous, even though the major part of
the occupation was in the post-Archaic pottery-making periods. The
tools are made of petrified wood and small chert or quartzite pebbles
which exhibit poor textural qualities. The objects, moreover, seem to
have been made hurriedly and carelessly by percussion flaking. Few of
them show evidence of prolonged use or repeated resharpening, suggesting the custom of fashioning them hurriedly as needed or discarding or losing them often. We have followed the usual cusom of classifying these objects on the basis of shape, size and location of the
knapping scars by which they were prepared. Certain groupings are
suggested by the physical appearance or by the location of the presumed functional area, and in these instances we have followed the
typology established by the above authors, in addition to that of Tunnell ( 1961 ), Davis and Davis (1960) and Dut~eld (1961).
1. THIN BIFACIAL TOOLS. These are chipped tools of relative thinness,
sometimes called knives or blades. A preference was manifested :~or
thin slabs or sheets of petrified wood, often showing some of the
original cortex on one or both faces. Otherwise materials are local
cherts, occasional quartzites or slabs of hematite. The petrified wood
was probably favored for these presumed cutting instruments because
of the natural tendency to cleave in longitudinal spalls which easily
produced a long sharp edge. There are 85 thin bifacials from the site.

thin rectangles of petrifed wood, with each end showing unaltered
cortex, the faces flat and unworked, and with functional sharp edges.
Seven of the 13 have cutting edges bilaterally, 6 unilaterally with the
opposite edge rounded or unaltered. One specimen has a longitudinal
central ridge, and 5 specimens are slightly thicker than the typical
tool, with one face flat and the opposite slightly convex. Lengths vary
from 3.5 to 11.2 era., widths from 9,.4 to 4.5 cm., and thicknesses are
5 to 9 ram. in the 7 typical specimens, 10 to 13.5 ram. in the thicker
ones.

(b) POINTED

SLABS

(Fig.

15 k, 1) : 12 specimens (all petrified

wood) are flat objects with straight, unaltered bases and gently incurving sharp edges which meet in a point, producing a long ovate outline. The faces show only enough modification to make them fairly
flat and smootlL The dimensions are rather uniform; the lengths vary
from 4.2 to 6.4 era., widths 2.2 to 3.1 era., and thicknesses of 7 to 10.4
ram. in the typical forms. Five specimens are piano-convex and
thicker, varying from 11 to 15 mm.
(c) OVAL reFACES (Fig. 15 a, b) : 5 specimens, 9. of petrified
wood, 9. of tan chert, one of quartzite. These are small, thin, circular
or oval bifaeially-ehipped objects, with thinned edges around the complete periphery or lacking finish in only a small arc. The maximum
diameters vary from 2.8 to 4 era., and the thicknesses from 6.2 to

19, mm.
(d)

FLAT

OVAL BIEACES (Fig. 15 o, p): 4 specimens, 9, intact, 2

broken. These are similar to the rectangular slabs and are made of
flat sheets of petrified wood with smooth faces and fine chipping to
produce a sharp edge around the entire circumference. Measurements of the two intact specimens are 6 by 4 cm. and 4.8 by 3.5 era.;
the broken specimens are 3.1 and 4.7 era. wide; thicknesses vary from
3 to 7 ram.
(e) LAI~CE OVATE BIFACES (Fig. 15 i, j): 4 specimens, 3 of petrified wood, and one of brown hematite. They are long ovate elliptical or
pear-shaped, thicker at the basal end. Three are worked around the
entire periphery and one shows a small area of cortex at the base.
The chipping is rough in 3 of the specimens, but one object of petrified wood (Fig. 15 j) is nicely shaped, with sharp edges. Lengths
range from 5.7 to 7.9 crn., widths from 9~.3 to 3.4 era., and thicknesses
from 8.5 to 19,.8 ram.
(f) S1VIALL OVATE BIFACES (Fig. 15 e, f) : 19, specimens, similar
in outline but smaller than the above. The piece is chipped all around
the edges in 9 instances, with a small amount of cortex at two bases.
Chipping is biracial with little, if any original surfaces on the bases.

THE

RESCH

SITE

59

Six of these objects are of petrified wood, 5 of tan chert, 1 of tan
quartzite. Lengths vary from 3.8 to 5 era., widths from 1.9 to 2.8 era.,
and thicknesses from 6.2 to 12.3 mm.
( g ) TRIANCULAR TO SUB-TRIANGULAR BIFACES
( Fig. 15 c, d ) : 9
specimens which are similar in execution to the ovate blades but
differ in having a triangular shape. They also resemble the pointed
slabs in shape but are smaller, and the peripheral thinning includes
the base. Seven of these blades are made of petrified wood, one of
hematite and one of gray granular chert. Lengths are 3.4 to 4.6 cm.,
widths 2 to 3.1 cm., thicknesses from 6 to 10 mm.
(h) STEMMED BIFACES (Fig. 15 g, h) : Seven specimens are ovate
or slightly elongate and differ by having a stem for hafting. The
rounded or unworked tips make it unlikely that they were projectiles
in fact, 4 of the 6 have original cortex at the distal end. The edges
are chipped by percussion with no evidence of pressure flaking. One
of these tools has a diagonally directed and beveled edge, but the
blade edge is convex. The stems are straight or slightly contracting
and are short. Five of the objects are made of petrified wood, 9. of
tan chert. Lengths range from 3.9 to 5.9 era., widths from 1.8 to 3.2
cm., thicknesses from 7 to 11 mm.
(i)

BROKEN AND IRRECULAR THIN- TOOLS; 20

specimens are broken,

apparently derived from the above categoriesbut uncertain because of
breakage. A few may be complete tools but are rough and irregular
in shape. Thirteen of these objects are of petrified wood, 9, of tan
chert and 5 of quartzite.
2. THICKER CHIPPED BIFACES: These are much thicker and rougher
tools, and with a few exceptions, are even more difficult to categorize.
Many are made of petrified wood, but a higher percentage is from
other materials, mostly local cherts. The rough percussion chipping by
which they were shaped occurs bifacially. There are 255 tools in this
general grouping.
(a) ELONGATE BIFACIAL TOOLS (Fig. 16 a, b) : 54 specimens have
various modifications of ovate, leaf-shaped, rectangular, or lanceolate
outlines, but all are relatively narrow and elongate, with rough chipping on both faces and around the edges. Some could be confused
with or could have been used as projectiles, but as a group they have
more the appearance of cutting tools. Many have one face rather
flat, the other ridged, to give a triangular cross-section. Although
chipped all over, 9,1 show small remnants of the original pebble
cortex at one or both ends, and an equal number have traces on the
faces. Twelve have an angulated or crescentic outline (Fig. 16 b) and
most of these show a better cutting edge on the outer curve. One of

these objects has a graver-like tip, which may be fortuitous. Thirtysix of these objects are of petrified wood, 16 of tan or red local chert
and 9. of quartzite. The lengths range from 3.7 to 6.9 era., the widths
@ore 1.5 to 2.4 era., the thickensses from 5 to 15.5 nnn.
(b) ELONGATE END TOOLS (Fig. 16d, e): Eight specimens are
similarly long and narrow, usually rectangular in shape, and differ
in that the only cutting edge is at one end of the tool. All of these
objects are of petrified wood, and 6 of the 8 show no chipping except
at the tool end. The other two are roughly chipped to form the body
but have no thinned edges. The chisel-like end is usually silghtly
wider than the body and mildly curved. In two instances it is diagonally placed; it is not unifacia!, but is formed by bilateral percussion chipping and fine flaking. The bifacial slant is not steep, as in
end scrapers, but is at an acute, blade-like angle. Lengths range from
4.2 to 6.8 cm., widths from 1.4 to 2.5 at midbody and from 1.5 to 3 at
the blade end; thicknesses are from 8 to 15 nnn.
(0) Si~IALL
BIFACE
TOOLS,
oval, ovate-acuminate, rectanguloid
(Fig. 16 c): 90 specimens are small and relatively thick, rough bifacially worked objects. They are similar to the elongate bifacials
except for smaller size and relative breadth. The chipping is rough,
the edges are wavy and rarely show resharpening or pressure flaking,
and the ends may be rounded or pointed. Some of these also could
have been used as projectiles, but there is no basal thinning or stem
formation and the tips are often blunt. As noted of the elongate tools,
many show pebble cortex remnants on the ends or faces, and a general
piano-convex shape is not unusual. There are 23 of these made of
petrified wood, 52 of tan loca! chert, 12 of red chert or jasper, and 3
are of granular quartzite. The range of length is 2.8 to 5.1 cm., of
width 1.5 to 3.3 cm. and of thickness 7.5 to 15.5 mm. Most of this

group falls within the limits of 3 to 4.5 cm. in length.
(d) POINTED PEBBLE TOOLS (Fig. 16 f, g): 65 specimens are what
would be called "Perkin Pikes" by Jelks (1965). These are pebble
tools, with knobby bases of unaltered pebble cortex, and bifacial or
trifacial rough chipping down to rounded or pointed ends, which
must have been the functional part of the tool. A few were made from

large spalls which had been thrown off larger cobbles; the original
cortex appears on one face, with rough shaping on the other. The
shaping of the tools in some instances starts near the cortex base but
occasionally begins about the midpoint of the object. No use polish
has been detected. Fourteen of these objects are of petrified wood, 35
of tan chert, 4 of red-brown chert, 1 of hematite, 7 of red-brown cong!omerate quartzite, and 4 of rough gray granular quartzite. Lengths

62

range from 3.1 to 6.4 era., widths from 9..3 to 4.2 era. and thicknesses
from 9.5 to 27 mm.
(e) PEBBLE SInE-BLADES (Fig. 16 h, i): 14 specimens are similar
to pointed pebble tools, except that the pebble is oval or crescentic in
outline. The original
chipped-out blade on
the entire length of
resembles a segment
fairly well sharpened.

pebble cortex is on the thicker side with a

the object. The outline of the tool somewhat

One of these tools is of petrified wood, 8 of tan

chert, one of gray chert, 2 of brown chert, and 2 of gray qualtzite.
The lengths range from 3.7 to 6 era., the width from 2.1 to 3.5 cm.,
and the thicknesses from 9 to 23 ram.
(f) OVATE "TURTLE-BACK" BIFACES

(Fig.

161) : 2 specimens are

irregularly oval in outline, bifaeially rough chipped, with one face
relatively flat or mildly convex, the other steeply chipped. The large
flake scars alternate at the edges to produce marked sinuosity of the
blade, with no secondary pressure flaking. One object is of petrified
wood, the other of tan chert. Dimensions are 5.5 by 3.9 by 2 cm. and
4 by 2.7 by 1.5 cm.
(g) CHIPPED PEBBLE CHOPPERS (Fig. 16 j) : 5 specimens are rectangular blocks, 4 of petrified wood and one of rough red granular
quartzite, unaltered except at one end to produce an irregular, rough
blade. The shaping was by percussion chipping, with no pressure
flaking or grinding. Hence the blade edges are irregular, although
an effective tool seems to have resulted. The blades are convex from
side to side, bifacially worked and equally sloped on the two faces.
They are moderately steep in three instances, less steep in two thinner
objects. Lengths are 5 to 7.5 cm., widths 3.3 to 5.2 em., and thicknesses 1.8 to 3.5 era.
(h) TWO ADDITIONAL TOOLS may belong with this group or may
be called chipped celts (Fig. 16 k). They are made of flat petrified
wood pebbles and have unaltered bases or polls and natural cortex
on both faces and on the basal half of both edges. From this position
on each edge, a rounded blade was produced by percussion chipping,
bifacially. Because of the thinness of the original pebble, the blade
bevel is not nearly so long and steep as in the previously described
tools; otherwise the idea is the same. Lengths are 5 and 4.4 cm., widths
4.1 and 3.5 cm., thicknesses 10 and 6.6 ram., respectively.
(i) IRREGULAR BIFACES, CORES AND REJECTS: There are 9 rough,
irregularly shaped, bifacially worked objects of medium size which
do not fit any of the above categories. Three are of petrified wood, 5
of tan chert and one of gray chert. Additionally there are 6 pebbles

THE

RESCH

SITE

of various sizes which show some percussion chipping but not enough
to call them tools. They may be unfnished tools, rejects or cores. One
is petrified wood, 3 are tan chert and 2 are rough granular quartzite.
3. THICK UNIFAClAL TOOLS: Three groups of tools, totalling 29 objects, relate to the thick bifaces in that they have considerable amounts
of pebble cortex on the surfaces, and show minimal rough percussion
chipping to form the tool; they differ in that they are unifacially
worked, the unworked face being flat.
(a) END SCItAPEItS ON SLABS (Fig. 17 a, b): 8 specimens fu!fill the
specifications established by Johnson (1962). All were made from slabs
of petrified wood and are rectangular in outline, with both faces flat.
Percussion chipping at one end and occasionally on the lateral edges
produced a steep unifacial bevel, which is concave on 4 specimens,
straight or slightly convex on 3, forming a "gouge" bit. Lengths range
from 3.3 to 4.3 cm., widths from 2.7 to 3.3 cm., thicknesses from 7 to
13 ram.
(b) OTHER UNIFACES (Fig. 17 d, e): 17 specimens. These are
crude tools of small to medium size and rather uniform in details of
manufacture. Superficially they resemble pointed pebble tools in
having a thick basal end which is unmodified pebble cortex on the
dorsal or convex face, with percussion chipped lower ends which narrow to a pointed or rounded bit. The tool outline is therefore roughly
ovate. The difference lies in the flat planar surface, which is either
the unmodified break of the original spall or has been flattened by
transverse large shallow flakes. The cross section of the object is
thick and semicircular. The longitudinal section is a modified triangle
with the plane face forming the hypotenuse, the thick unmodified
base and the slant down to the tool edge at the tip forming the
shorter sides. The ventral face is occasionally concave, making the
junction at the sinuous tool margins even more angulated. Usually
g to ~ of the dorsal or convex face is percussion chipped down to the
margins; the functional edge usually involves about half of the circumference. Materials are: tan or red chert, 13 objects; gray quartzite
2; red granuJar quartzite 2. Lengths range from 3.7 to 4.6 era., widths
from 2.1 to 3.1 cm., and thicknesses from 1.2 to 3.3 cm.
(C) POSSIBLE GOUGES: 4 rough objects are cortex-base tools with
one planar face and irregular percussion-chipped beveling on the
opposite face to produce a possible blade. One is triangular in outline
and piano-convex, the convex face being pebble cortex. The plane face
is the result of its break from the larger cobble, with one modifying
flake scar. At the larger but thinner end of the convex face, percussion flaking has produced an obtuse bevel to the bit edge, which is

sinuous. Two other objects are portions of small pebbles, irregularly
ovate in outline with cortex at the base and similar obtuse unifaeial
beveling to produce mildly convex bits which are sinuous on end
view. In each instance the cortex has been removed from the plane
face by very thin flakes, so that in none of the three objects does the
original cortex form part of the working bit of the tool. The fourth tool
has a natural taper on the dorsum, worked off only at the blade margins. Two of the objects are made of tan chert, a third of hard sandstone, the fourth of petrified wood. Lengths are 3.5 to 4.5 era., maximum widths 3.3 to 4 cm., thicknesses 1.8 to 2.5 era.
4. S5,IALL FLAKE TOOLS: In contrast to the 38,000 chips and flakes
found in the excavated squares, the 115 flakes showing retouch or
use retouch is quite modest. Most of the latter are of small to medium
size and show use scars rather than a modification of outline. Some of
them show generally better workmanship than the large flaked tools
and most reflect the same dependence on local raw materials.
(a)

FLAKE

SCI:{APERS,

MEDIUM

SIZE

(Fig. 17 h). Twenty-eight

flakes of medium size (arbitrarily chosen as between 3.5 to 4.6 era.
in greatest diameter) show evidence of having been used on one or
more edges. Flake shapes are unchanged from the original forms
which were variously oval, elongate, triangular, leaf-shaped and irregular. Five oval or ovate flakes are nicely shaped and have use scars
around the entire periphery. These use scars appear on the convex
face, indicating that the margin of the opposite concave face formed
the scraping or cutting edge. Materials include: petrified wood (8),
tan local chert (10), brown granular quartzite (7), hematite (1), and
quartz crystal (1).
(b) FLAKE SCI:~APEI:IS, SMALL SIZE
(Fig. 17 g). The 35 smaller
flakes in this category are much like those described above in shape
and evidence of use. A size range of 9, to 3.4 era. in greatest diameter
defines the group. Materials include petrified wood (5), red or brown

local chert (9.9,), granular quartzite (1), gray waxy chert (1), other
gray cherts thought to be of Central Texas origin (5), and novaculite (1). Most are within the range of 9, to 3 cm. in greatest diameter.
(C)

SMALL END-SCRAPEI:tS ON COI:~TEX FLAKES

(Fig. 17 i, j). Thirty-

one specimens are made on spalls flaked from pebbles or cobbles and
bear the original cortex on their convex face. Most are oval in outline and slightly thicker at the proximal end. One is of petrified wood,
9,4 of tan or red chert, 1 of hematite and 5 of quartzite. The range
of greatest diameter is 1.8 to 3.4 cm.; thickness of most is 3 to 6 ram.,
with a few at I0 to 19, nun.
(d) SMALL END-SCI~APEI~S WITX~ STEMS (Fig. 17 m, n). Four speci-

66

TEXAS AIICHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

mens are chipped over most of their surfaces. They are ovate-acuminate or fan-shaped in outline with a small stem, which is broken off
one of the specimens. They were shaped by small, carefully placed
pressure flaking running from the margins on the convex face to a centra! ridge. The opposite or flatter face is flaked, but it is flattened at the
bit end by use of the original spall sear or by careful shallow flaking,
to produce a concavo-convex bit with minute serrations. One tool has
these worn to a smooth arc, either in preparation or from use. The
others retain a sharper cutting edge. All of these are of tan or brown
local chert. Lengths range from 2.8 to 3 em., widths from 1.7 to 2.4
em. and thicknesses from 6.5 to 8 ram.
(e) SMALL END-SCI~APERS WITH STEEP BITS (Fig. 17 c, f). To some
people, these two specimens would be known as "thumbnail" scrapers. One is an oval, small, flat pebble of tan chert (Fig. 17 f) with
one face flattened by small percussion flakes. The opposite or dorsal
face is convex from the natural curve of the pebble and is covered by
the smooth cortex except for about 75% of the periphery, which has
multiple steep flake scars to produce an obtuse angle with the edge
of the plane face. The length is 3.2 era., the width 2.2 cm., and the
thickness is 11.5 ram. The second object (Fig. 17 c) is made from a
thinner flake of tan chert, irregularly fan-shaped in outline. The scraping bit is opposite the percussion scar. The obverse face is steeply
beveled at the bit end by tiny flaking. The converse face is sharply
concave at the bit end, accentuating the cutting edge. The scraper is
2.2 cm. long, 9..3 cm. wide and 6 mm. in greatest thickness.
(f) SMALL BIFACIAL TOOLS:
TWO small tools are well finished
bifacially. One (Fig. 16 m) is of petrified wood, wedge-shaped, with
cortex base and with some shaping of the straight faces and edges. The
terminal bit is arc-shaped and blunted bifacially as though used extensively. The dimensions are: length 3.4 era., width 2.2 era., greatest
thickness 11.4 ram. The second tool (Fig. 17 o) of tan chert, is fanshaped, thin, bifacially flaked with minute scars which produced a
thin edge around the complete circumference. One face is convex,
the other ahnost flat but shows mild rounding. The edges are minutely
serrated but show little use polish or scarring. The length is 2.9 era.,
the width 2.4 era., the thickness 5 ram.

(g)

GRAVERS

(Fig.

17p-r). Seven specimens of triangular to

pentagonal outline have a small graver tip which is placed at the
terminal projection of the flake in 6 instances, on the side in one. Four
are flaked over all of the surface area bUacia!ly. The others are partially flaked, unifacially in two instances, bifacially on the other. In two
instances, the sharp graving projection seems to have been fortuitous,

but it is accentuated by fine pressure flaking on its lateral shoulders.
The others show fine flaking to form the spur. Four of these objects
may also have been used as side scrapers. One is made of petrified
wood, 4 of tan and 2 of brown chert. Lengths range from 2.5 to 4.2
era., widths 2.2 to 2.8 era., thicknesses from 6 to 13 ram. The spurs
project 2 to 3 mm. in all but one, which is 5 mm.
(h) DRILLS (Fig. 17k, 1). There are three specimens, two of
which are broken across the middle of the bit. One of tan chert (Fig.
171) is slender, with a slight bulge near the center. It is quadrilateral
in cross section, 4.4 cm. long, 1.1 era. in greatest diameter and 8 ram.
in thickness. The other two are of gray and waxy brown cherts of
exotic origin, have expanded bases and broken drill stems (Fig. 17 k).
Basal measurements are 1.5 and 2.1 era. in width and 7 to 8 mm. in
thickness. Present lengths are 2.8 and 2.9 cm.
(i) NOTCHES (Fig. 17 s, t). Three notched flakes may have been
used as spokeshaves. Two of these are made of petrified wood and
one is of waxy gray chert. They have crescentic ares cut in one edge.
The other edges are thinned like side scrapers. The objects of petrified wood are rectangular in outline, while the chert object is ovate.
Sizes are 2.9 to 5.5 cm. in greatest diameter, 2.5 to 5 era. in lesser
diameter and 5 to 8 mm. in thickness. The crescentic bits are 11, 13
and 18 mm. in diameters.
F.

GROUND AND UsE-SR,IOOTHED STONES

There are 135 large stones from the Resch Site which show evidence
of having been shaped for or by use. These were found at all levels,
except the first 6 inches (Table 6). They consist of mortars, pitted
stones, mullers, mauls or hammerstones, anvils and flat slabs. It is of
probable significance that nearly half of these are pitted stones.
(a) ~ORTARS (Fig. 18J-k): 3 specimens are of rough ~erruginous
sandstone, irregularly oval or rectanguloid in outline. One is 20 by 13
era., 9 cm. thick, with a shallow depression on one face (Fig. 18 k).
The bowl is oval in shape, 13 by 10.5 cm. and 1.5 cm. in depth. The
second (Fig. 18 j) is a combination mortar and pitted stone, 21.5 by
19 cm. and 10.3 era. thick. One face has an oval trough 16 by 11.5 cm.,
1.3 cm. deep, with two pits in the bottom, 2.3 to 2.5 cm. in diameter.
The opposite face has a trough, 17 by 14.5 cm., in which there are
13 circular pits, each 9, by 2.7 cm. in diameter. The third mortar (Fig.
18 i) is open to some question. It is 14.5 by 14 cm. and 7 cm. thick.
One face is flat, and when seated on this face, the opposite is slanted,
with a long trough which is open at the lower end. The trough (19, by
8 cm.) is distinctly ground, but may have served some other function
than a true mortar.

fled wood and one of tan chert. They vary in size from 16 by 19. by
6.5 cm. to 6.5 by 3.2 em., but most are comfortably hand-size,
5.5 to 10 era. in diameter. Shapes are generally those of the natural
cobbles, with some alteration by peeking. In outline they are ovoid,
rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal and pentagonal. Thirty-eight of
the stones have a single pit on one face; 22 have a single pit on each
face; one has 9, pits on one face; one has 1 pit on one face and two on
the opposite, and the final stone has a single pit on one face and three
on the opposite face. The final stone listed had broken through opposed pits and 9. new pits had been placed on the break surface. The
pits are hemispherical craters, ranging from 2 to 6 era. in diameter and
4 to 16 ram. in depth; most pits are rather uniformly 2.5 to 3.5 era. in
diameter and 10 to 15 ram. in depth. The majority of pits are smooth
on the sandstone cobbles and highly polished on the hematite, but in
6 instances the pits are peeked out but not ground. Two of the sandstone and 8 of the hematite objects have one or both faces ground
smooth and mildly convex, suggesting a combined pitted stone and
muller. About a third of the objects show alteration of the edges by
peeking or grinding; the latter could have resulted from intentional
alteration or by use polish. Only two of the objects exhibit the trait,
frequent on Archaic sites in northern Louisiana, of having depressed or
ground-out areas on the lateral edges, as though to make the stones
more comfortable to the fingers. Hard usage is indicated by the fact
that 13 of the 63 stones are broken.
(e) MULLERS (Fig. 18a, e, f): 29 stones were found which are
thought to be mullers or combination mullers and hammerstones.
Eight of these are hematite, 17 ferruginous sandstone, one petrified
wood and 3 hard quartzite. In outline they are oval, ovate or rectangular with rounded corners. Diameters range from 4.5 to 11 cm.,
but most objects are 6 to 9 cm. long and 4.5 to 7.5 era. wide, with a
rather uniform thickness of 3.5 to 5.2 era. One or both faces are
ground flat or mildly convex, and half of the stones have one or both
ends battered. A sandstone object, 8.4 by 5.9 by 3.7 cm. in measurements, and a slightly smaller hematite object are oval in outline with
pointed ends which suggest a wide boatstone shape. Each has a :Sat
face with a slight oval-shaped central concavity and a strongly convex
opposite face (Fig. 19 d, e).
( d ) 1VIAULS, ANVILS AND HA~I~âIEI=~STONES ( Fig. 18 g, h) : There are
31 stones of various sizes which show some evidence of battering,
usually at the ends. Most are thought to have been heavy mauls or
hammerstones, but many have flat faces which could have served as
anvils. Eight of these are hematite, 0.5 to 2 kg. (1 to 4 pounds) in

70

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

weight. Two are spherical, and 6 are irregularly cuboidal or elongate.
Ten of similar size are cherts, granite or hard sandstones. One of these
is spherical, another is discoid, and a third is loaf-shaped. Eight are
blocks of petrified wood (Fig. 18 g), with rounded corners and flat
ends and measure 7 to 13.8 cm. in length, 4.8 to 7.8 cm. in transverse
diameters. Three blocks of hematite, one of petrified wood, and one
of sandstone are smaller, show battered ends and possibly were peeking stones or small hammerstones.
(e)
FLAT SLABS: 9 specimens. One is a large, thick saddle-shaped
slab of hematite, 9,5 cm. long and 19.5 era. wide. It shows little indication of use, except that the concave saddle face is smooth and has
shallow pits which might result from anvil use. Five other hematite
and 3 sandstone slabs are smaller: 7.5 to 16.8 era. in length and 6.3
to 10 era. in width, 1.4 to 3.7 cm. in thickness. The largest of the hematite slabs is partially hoe-shaped, but one straight side may represent
a break. The possible blade is thin but rounded, without evidence of
sharpening. A smaller sandstone slab has a gently rounded end which
is beveled and conceivably could have been used for sawing.
C. POLISHED STONE OBJECTS

Polished ornaments and problematica! objects are notable by their
scarcity, as are ground and polished celts.
(a) GROOVED AXES (Fig. 19 a, b): Two grooved axes were found
during the excavation. One (Fig. 19 a) is a large, fully grooved axe
of reddish hematite or limonite, well made but showing numerous
breaks and scratches. In several places the thin outer layer has scaled
off, as is often seen with hematite objects of some antiquity. The length
is 13 em.; the width 8 cm. at midbody, 7 cm. at the poll and 7.5 era.
just above the blade; the maximum thickness is 5.9, cm. The blade is
rounded, blunt on profile and shows fractures. The poll is smoothly
rounded but has use scars. The polished groove is 1.5 to 1.7 era. wide
and 4 to 5 mm. deep.
The second specimen is represented by the basal half (Fig. 19 b)
which was broken into 8 pieces when found. It is of black, glossy
hematite, well ground and nicely finished. The original shape was
rectangular. The width is 7 cm. at midbody, 6 em. at the base; the
thickness is 2.5 era. The existing fragment is 6.5 em. long, projecting
an original length of 12 to 13 era.
(b) CELT ( Fig. 19 c) : One celt of brown hematite is chipped and
partially ground, mostly near the blade. It is smalh 8.1 cm. long,
6 em. wide and 2 cm. in maximmn thickness. The basal end is rough,
as are the faces. The edges and bit are shaped by rough chipping and
partial grinding; the blade edge has use blunting.

(c) COUCE (Fig. 19 i): A beautifully shaped object of black
hematite is outlined by chipping and is partially ground. It is modified triangular or ovoid in shape, with thin, ground edges and base;
the faces are partly ground to a lenticular cross section. At the larger
end there is a unifaeial steeply beveled bit, which is cut straight
across, producing a curved bit edge along the reverse face. Fine secondary flaking sharpens the bit; moderate use polish occurs on the
obverse part of the bit and the reverse face is highly polished at the
blade end. Length is 5.7 era., width at bit is 3.4 cm., and maximum
thickness is 1.5 cm.
(d) HE~X~ATITE DISC (Fig. 19 h): A small circular disc of hematite is highly polished, with 5 flat facets on the obverse face. The converse face is shaped to a mild convexity by percussion chipping, then
partially ground; the peripheral margin is also ground. The object is
3.8 to 3.9 cm. in diameter, 8.5 ram. in thickness. Presumably it was an
ornament.
(0) STONE CUP FRAGMENTS (Fig. 19k, 1, m): There are 4 fragments of shaped and polished stone, two of which are from the same

object and fit together. The shapes and smooth rims suggest small
cups or stone pipe bowl fragments (no fragment shows a stem opening). The two fitted fragments (Fig. 19 m) are of a hard tan stone,
probably derived from a geode, and form the base and about ~i the
circumference of a small cup, approximately 4 era. in diameter and 2.4
cm. high. The rim is incurvate and the lip almost flat. Wall thickness
is 4 nam. just below the lip and 7 ram. at the base. It is smooth and
undecorated. The break edges are worn and smoothed.
The second object (Fig. 19 1) is a fragment of banded limonite,
with a smooth thin lip and polished surfaces and the breaks are
sharp. The projected diameter is 3 to 3.2 enI.
The third of these objects is of red jasper (Fig. 19 k) and is similarly made but slightly smaller than the object of tan stone. Nearly
half of the object is present, if it was symmetrical. It appears to be
another small cup with squared sides which are partially rounded. One
edge of the break is very thin, and the break may have occurred as
a result of miscalculation during the drilling of the concavity. Exterior
and interior surfaces are highly polished. The height is 2.6 cm. and
the diameter is 3.2 cm. The thickness is 8.5 mm. at the base, 4 mm. at
the lip and 2 ram. at the side walls.
EXOTIC MATERIALS

A small quartz crystal (Fig. 19 f) has been rounded and partieally
grooved by fine flaking at one end, presumably for suspension as a

pendant. The opposite end is natural. The length is 2.7 cm., the diameter 8 mm. A leaf-shaped fragment of quartz (Fig. 19 g) is 3 cm. long,
1.5 cm. wide and 8 mm. thick. It appears to have been roughly shaped
to form a smal! scraper. Another flake scraper of quartz crystal has
been mentioned. There is one unshaped nugget of galena (Fig. 19j),
1.8 to 2.1 era. in diameter.
FOOD

SOURCES

Direct information about food sources of the inhabitants is meager.
About 500 fragments of charred hickory, walnut and pignut hulls were
found in 382 levels of 200 5 foot squares (Fig. 20 A). By vertical provenience the occurrence of these charred hulls was as follows: Level 3:
in 46 squares; Level 4: 87; Level 5: 105; Level 6: 85; Level 7: 51;
Level 8: 7, and Level 9:1 square. Bone was minimal and fragmentary.
Most of it showed as traces in the soil, but 45 fragments were sufficiently intact to save. Six of these could be identified as deer, one as
bird. Additionally there were 9 deer teeth identified. Only two animal bones, both deer, were larger than 6 cm. in length.
PROVENIENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ARTIFACTS

Impressions during excavation and the recording of artifact provenience indicated that artifacts were scattered throughout the midden
in all excavated areas, with minor concentrations (Fig. 3) in the
central block. It also seemed that concentrations of artifacts were
heavier over the lower end of the terrace than on the slopes or at the
upper end. Good evidences of vertical distribution, using relative nmnbers of objects in the various levels, were also established. We have
attempted to clarify these impressions and by various studies of horizonta! and vertical provenience, to establish as clear a picture of
aboriginal occupation as we can justify with the numbers of objects
involved.
It is hoped by such studies to indicate patterns of aboriginal occupation during the various culture periods represented at the site, to
note changes in time, and to note variations in activities-male or
female-in various parts of the site. Our failure to reach these objectives to our satisfaction or to fully document our tentative conclusions can presumably be attributed to the nature of the occupation
and of the soil, to the many factors which influence deposition and
alter the original placement of objects, and possibly to some deficiencies in our study niechanism.
Theoretically, a site which was occupied intermittently or continuously for more than a thousand years should show a layering of

occupational refuse, distributed to some extent in accordance with
the living patterns or activities. Structures were built and destroyed,
fires were made and covered, pots were broken and discarded, stone
objects were fashioned or resharpened or lost, with the residues presumably available for study. If women cooked in certain areas, firebeds or firestones, ashes and charcoal should so indicate and sherds of
broken pots or the stones for grinding seeds or the cracking of nuts
should be nearby, especially if broken and discarded. If men sat in
certain places to fashion or resharpen projectile points or stone tools,
or to work bone, wood or leather objects, then a concentration of
flakes and discarded or lost objects might so indicate. All of these indicators were present but seldom in such concentrations as to give a
clear picture. We are forced to accept minimal conclusions.
The factors at this site which mitigate against this theoretical layering, structuring and clustering of residue are numerous. There are
no evidences of large permanent structures or of heavy occupation;
no burials were found. The soil is porous sand, easily washed by rain
or overflow, and easily disturbed by human or animal activities. Vertical as welt as horizontal displacement of objects is readily accomplished, and we found evidence of much tunneling by gophers and
other animals. Human occupation and land clearing during the past
century has certainly had some effect, and the light soil could as easily
have been churned by aboriginal activities as by recent cultivation. At
any stage of aboriginal occupation, objects left by previous inhabitants
could have been found by adults or children and reused or at least
dislocated.

A.

HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION

The provenience of major artifact classes by excavated 5 foot
squares in the central block is shown in Fig. 3, in relation to features
like rock clusters, ash and charcoal concentrations and possible post
molds. Disturbances due to previous excavations are indicated, chiefly
in the southwestern sector of the block. The numbers of each of the
three artifact classes-pottery sherds, projectile points and stone toolsare indicated in the square of origin. There is remarkable uniformity
in the relatively thin artifactual residue. The 245 squares contained
2390 of these objects, averaging slightly less than 10 per square and
slightly more than 1 per 6 inch level. Of these, 1387 were sherds,
averaging 5.66 per square; 456 were projectile points, averaging 1.86
per square; and 547 were stone tools, averaging 2.23 per square. Only
20 of the 245 squares contained more than 10 sherds each; 9 of these
squares were in the NE sector, 7 in the SE sector, 1 in the NW and 3

76

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

in the SW sectors. Only 2 squares, both in the NE sector, contained
more than 5 projectiles each. Twelve squares yielded more than 5
stone tools each; 7 were in the NE sector, 4 in the NW, and 1 in the
SW. Of the 31 squares in which these unusual numbers of objects were
found, 21 are included in the 100 squares which surround the center
stake, between the N25, E25, $9_5 and W25 lines. A further cheek of the
total objects found in the i00 central squares shows that the major
concentration of objects is in sherds. There were 633 sherds in these
squares, an average of 6.33 per square in comparison with an average
of 5.2 sherds per square in the remaining 145 squares of the central
block. In the 100 squares around the center stake there were 191 projectiles, averaging slightly above the average of 1.83 for the remaining
145 squares. There were 256 stone tools, or 2.56 per square, which is
somewhat above the average of 2.0 for the remaining 145 squares. It is
revealing of the thin occupation that the sherds of Vessels 1 to 4, most
of which were found within the 100 squares around the center stake,
total 90 or one-seventh of the 633 sherds found in these squares. All of
the sherds in these 100 squares would, therefore, be the equivalent of
only 30 pottery vessels.
Another area of concentration appears in the northern tier of
squares in the NE sector of the central block. Thirty squares lying
between the N25 and N45 lines and between the 0 and E40 lines
yielded 335 artifacts (11 per square), of which sherds average 5.7,
projectiles 2.5 and stone tools 3.0 per square, indicating a concentration of lithics rather than sherds.
Plotting of the horizontal distribution of charred nut hulls, pitted
stones and other ground stone tools (mullers, mortars, hammerstones,
anvils) shows two interesting configurations (Fig. 20 A). There is an
area of concentration around and east of the center stake, corresponding to the area of sherd concentration described above. There is also a
band of concentration diagonally across the northern tier of squares
in the central block, and a third minor band across the SW sector.
All three bands suggest a NW-SE trending, almost paralleling the
course of the terrace (Fig. 2).
Fig. 20 B shows the provenience by squares of the sherds from
which Vessels 1 to 4 were reconstructed, also the horizontal provenience of the sherds identified as Tehefuncte, Marksville, Coles
Creek and Caddoan. The sherds of Vessel 1 were almost undisturbed
after it was broken, suggesting that it was covered with soil shortly
thereafter (no burial or cache pit was in evidence). The sherds of Vessels 2 and 4 were moderately dispersed over areas of 100-250 square
feet, with a few widely displaced sherds. The sherds of Vessel 3 were

THE

scattered over half of the excavated block, as far as 60 feet apart. The
preponderance of the recognized Tchefunete sherds, also Vessel 1 and
most of Vessel 3, are in the western half of the excavated block (Fig.
20 B and Table 5), near the stream. Marksville sherds are scattered
but most are in the northern sectors. Coles Creek sherds, differing
from Tehefunete, are proponderantly in the eastern sectors of the
block, further from the stream, while Caddoan sherds are more
widely dispersed than are those of any other period. These proveniences suggest limited occupation, in time and extent, during the Tehefuncte and Coles Creek periods.
In order to divide the central block of excavations more evenly, the
occurrence of objects in 4 quadrants (to distinguish from the sectors
defined by the survey axes) was calculated after quadrating the block
by using the El0 line as a N-S divider and the 0-0 line as E-W divider.
Table 5 shows the relative occurrence of various groups of objects in
the resulting quadrants, which contain 65, 70, 54 and 56 squares. It
also compares the relative occurrence of the various objects or groupings in the 8 squares north of the" N120 line (North area), the 19
squares east of the access road (East area) and the 13 squares encircling the excavation block (other areas). In the central block, it
appears that the average of sherds, projectiles, chipped and ground
tools, and flakes are fairly uniform in the 4 quadrants. The average
number of sherds is slightly higher in the NE and SE quadrants. Dart
projectiles and stone tools average slightly higher in the NE (heavier
archaic oecupationP), and flakes slightly higher in the NW. Arrow
projectiles are more numerous in the SE and SW quadrants than in the
northern tier, corresponding with the slightly higher yield of Caddoan
and Coles Creek sherds in the southern quadrants. The larger numbers of Tehefunete sherds in the western quadrants and of Marksville
in the northern is again in evidence.
None of these variations, however, is as marked as the differences
noted in the areas away from the major excavated block. The North
area, most of which is 100 feet from the block, maintains a good
sherd yield, but bone-tempered sherds are diminished and claytempered increased in relative proportions. No Tehefuncte sherds
and only one each of Marksville and Coles Creek were found, but 10
Caddoan sherds were recognized. Dart projectiles hold up well, but
chipped and ground stone tools are in small numbers and flakes are
distinctly less numerous. The indications are of lighter occupation in
the North area during earlier periods but of increased usage during
Caddoan times.
The East area, across the access road, shows a general drop of about

50 percent in sherds, dart propectiles, chipped and ground stone tools
and flakes, in comparison with the cenhâal excavated block. The absence of Caddoan sherds and the low yield of only one Coles Creek
sherd and one arrow propeetile, in comparison with 4 Marksville and
one Tchefunete sherds, indicates that the lighter occupation occurred
during the earlier ceramic periods. This indication is enhanced by the
preponderance of sand-tempered sherds over clay-tempered.
The 13 other squares surrounding the central block show nothing
distinctive in a differential fashion, but a diminished yield of all artifacts and flakes again suggests the preference of the peoples at a!!
times for the higher terrace rather than the slopes.
B.

COMBINED HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION.

A further study of pottery sherd concentration in the central excavated block, combining horizontal and vertical distribution, was made
by constituting two artificial zones: an upper zone for which all sherds
in Levels 1 through 5 were plotted in the squares from which they
derived, and a lower zone comprising sherds from Levels 6 through
9, similarly plotted. This was checked by plotting sherds by square of
provenience for each of the five major levels, 3-7. The purpose was to
determine whether the several concentrations of sherds, previously
noted, might be related to earlier or later occupations. Although the
sherd counts by individual squares and levels were generally too
sparse to be defnitive, when combined with the zone groupings
there were some clarifications of the clustering. The concentration of
sherds immediately south of the center stake (Fig. 3) in the squares
between 0-S15 and W10-E10 lines involved all major levels. By contrast, the concentration immediately north of the center stake (0-N15
and W10-E5) related largely to sherds from the upper zone, especially Level 4. Sherds of Vesse! 4 were involved in this deposit.
Another concentration east of the center stake, between lines 0-S10
and E15-E25, derived from the upper zone and especially level 3, and
included sherds of Vessel 2. Two concentrations in the NE sector
(N20-35, 0-El5 and N10-30, E25-40) had scattered sherds from the
upper zone and major derivation from Levels 6 and 7.
All of these "concentrations" are relative and seem to result from
the breakage of only a few vessels in each instance. With one exception, these sherd concentrations coincide with the areas in which
charred nut hulls and ground stone tools (Fig. 20 A) are concentrated,
but no close association is in evidence. The exception is the northcentral concentration of sherds (N20-35, E-15) which derive fiâom
Levels 6 and 7 and with which a light residue of nut hulls and grind-

ing or pitted stones is associated. Ash and charcoal are missing.
Except for the area immediately south of the center stake where the
possible post molds suggest a structure, there is no good correlation
of these various evidences of culinary and other domestic activities.
The conclusion is ahnost inescapable that intermittent and sporadic
brief camping in temporary shelters is represented, with the campsites
at various locations on the preferred lower end of the terrace.
C. VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION

Most of our data on vertical distribution are derived from use of
the entire collection, plotted by vertical artificial levels (Table 6, Fig.
21, 9,2). Levels 1 and 2 are combined because of the paucity of artifacts and the disturbed nature of the soil in the plow zone. A few
flakes found in the 6 inches below Level 9 (54-60 inch depth) are
added to the totals from that level in the three involved squares; no
other artifacts were found below 54-inch depth. The table and graphs
therefore show Levels 1-2 and 3 through 9.
In view of the variations in horizontal distribution of certain objects
in these squares outside of the central block (Table 5), the artifacts
from these extraneous areas were plotted separately by excavation
levels. Those from the North and East areas will be discussed later.
The variations are minor and the numbers probably are not statistically significant, hence we include all areas in the single major study
of vertical provenience.
Before examining the results of these studies, evidence should be
recorded that pottel7 sherds were subjected to considerable vertical as
well as horizontal displacement. Many of the sherds showed teeth
marks of rodents, especially among the sherds tempered with bone or
clay; sherds of Vessel 2 had been gnawed to an extent that adjacent
sherds no longer touched. Moreover, sherds of Vessels 2, 3 and 4 were
not only dispersed laterally (Fig. 20 B) but were found at depths
which varied from 18 to 30 inches. Vessel 2, for example, derived
largely from Level 3 (7 sherds) and Level 4 (4 sherds) but 2 sherds
of this vessel came from Level 6. Vessel 3 had 6 sherds from Level 7,
4 from Level 4, inferred as its level of origin, but other sherds came
from Levels 3, 5 and 6. Similar vertical displacement is noted of other
sherds which formed portions of vessels. The sand-tempered urn, of
which a fitted portion is shown in Fig. 6 b, had sherds from Levels 3, 4,
5 and 6; the assumed origin is Level 5. The three portions of sand
and bone-tempered vessels, of flower-pot shape (Fig. 6 a, c, d), each
had the greater number of sherds from Level 4 but others derived
from Levels 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The incised sand-tempered vessel shown

THE

IRESCH

SITE

81

in Fig. 6 g, h is represented by 2 sherds from Level 4 and one each
from Levels 3 and 6. Three fitted Marksville Stamped sherds (Fig.
10 v) were found in Squares E1 N3 and W1 N30, 135 feet apart, but
this is not serious because all were from Level 6. Sherds of a Coles
Creek Incised vessel (Fig. 11 a, f) came from Levels 2, 3 and 6. Seven
sherds of a single Caddoan bottle spout (Fig. ilk) were found in
Levels 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (2 each from Levels 4 and 6). Two sherds of
the same Pineland Punctated vessel (Fig. 11 y, z) were from Levels
3 and 5.
These distressing vagaries in vertical provenience of sherds, with
evidences of upward and downward displacement, inhibit the drawing of conclusions from any small number of sherds; they force reliance on large numbers and general trends rather than finer delineations. One can only hope that provenience of stone objects is more
reliable, although there is no direct evidence for or against vertical displacement of non-ceramic items.
The provenience of all objects found at the site is shown in Table 6,
by individual types, by classes of artifact types, and by excavation
levels. The total number of artifacts, excluding flakes and unworked
stones, is 2696, of which potsherds constitute 57~g. From this Table we
have drawn graphs of a number of types and classes in attempts to
find signifiicant trends.
Fig. 21 A shows the changes in relative numbers of major artifact
classes by excavation levels. Each horizontal bar shows the percentages of the total artifacts found at that level represented by sherds,
dart points, arrow points, chipped stone tools and ground stone tools;
the total number of artifacts from a given level is shown to the right
of each bar. Objects of uncertain provenience and "polished and exotic
objects" are not included. Notable trends are: (1) pottery sherds
increase in relative proportions from the lower to the upper levels, at
a fairly regular rate and largely at the expense of dart points and
chipped stone tools. (2) Dart points and chipped stone tools are parallel in numbers at the various levels in their progressive decrease
from bottom to top. (3) Ground stone tools show a similar relative
decrease with time, interrupted in Levels 3 and 4. (4) Arrow points
are missing from the lower levels and progressively increase in the
upper levels, but only exceed dart points in Levels 1 and 2. Except for
this progressive but incomplete replacement of dart points by arrow
points, there are therefore no striking and sudden changes in the relative numbers of these artifact classes, but rather slow and progressive
alterations. We shall look later at changes of types within these
classes.

In Fig. 9,1 B the pottery sherds are examined for changes in tempering characteristics from bottom to top, presumably reflecting changes
in time during the occupation of the site. Sherds of uncertain provenience and with tempering characteristics other than the three major
ones-sand, bone and day-are excluded. Again there are no sudden
changes; bone tempering remains remarkably stable at 35 to 40~ at all
levels. The only significant trend is the slow but progressive diminution in sand tempering and the converse increase in clay tempering,
especially in the three top levels. Between Levels 7 and 4, during
major occupation of the site, bone tempering slowly increases and,
overall, it is the most popular aplastic at the site.
In Fig. 9,2 the graphs show percentages by excavation levels of various artifact types within the classes of artifacts previously examined,
as well as some of these classes. The bar graph for a given level expresses the percentage of the type or class at that level of the total
number for all levels, hence shows changes in numbers from below
upward. When compared, there is some evidence of relative popularity of certain types at the various periods reflected by vertical
levels. The graphs as a whole show that the major occupation of the
site is reflected in Levels 7 (36-42 inch depth) through Level 4 (18-24
inch depth). If we may safely use total sherds and stone flakes as indicators of expected artifact density at given levels, since these are
objects which are present at all levels and in largest numbers, it
would appear that a percentage of any type or class below 13Yo or
above 25~o at any level between 4 and 7 is evidence of significant
alteration.
The rapid drop in numbers and frequencies of objects in Levels
8 and 9 suggests that these levels are largely below the occupation
zone, and that some of the artifacts may have been carried down.
However, the presence of most classes of artifacts, up to 2-3~, in Level
8 make it possible that the artificial dividing line between Levels 7 and
8, at 3J6 feet, may have been slightly above the lowest occupation zone
in some squares. Moreover, the occurrence in Levels 8 and 9 of
Archaic objects like the two grooved axes, projectile point types like
Palmillas, Kent and Ellis which elsewhere seem to be slightly earlier
than Gary, thick chipped stone tools, and the broken base of a concave-base point indicates visits to the site by Archaic peoples before
the major occupation started.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is a progressive diminution
in number of artifacts in the uDper three levels, 165 specimens in Level
3 and only 81 from Levels 1 and 2 combined, in comparison with
400-700 objects per level at Levels 4-7. The only exceptions are arrow

projectiles and, surprisingly, flakes; the latter diminish but at a slower
rate. One might think of selective collecting from the site, but there is
no history of such in recent years and amateur collectors seldom
bother with crude tools. Even the wooded parts of the site show the
same trends, with a deposit of virtually sterile soil over the top foot.
We must conclude that the site was abandoned in early Caddoan
times and covered with virtually sterile soil.
The bar graph (Fig. 22) for tota! pottery sherds follows the above
trends, with some representation in Levels 9 and 8, a marked increase
in Level 7 to peak in Level 6 and gradually fall in Levels 5 and 4,
and finally a rapid fall in Levels 3 to 1. The trends for each of the
three tempering techniques, sand, bone and clay, are remarkably
similar to the total graph and to each other; minor variations are the
slightly higher than average percentage for sand-tempered sherds in
the lower levels and drop-off in the upper levels, the increase in bonetempered sherds in Level 4, and the higher than average of claytempered sherds in Levels 3-t. These studies, however, corroborate
the findings noted in Fig. 21 B that pottery sherds were present at all
levels and that no striking change in tempering techniques occurred
during the life of the site.
The graphs of vertical provenience of Tehefuncte, Marksville, Coles
Creek and Caddoan sherds (Fig. 22) reflect the unhappy vertical
displacement of sherds noted previously. From many stratigraphie
studies elsewhere, deposition at this site would be expected in the
order listed, with Tehefuncte oldest and therefore in lowest levels,
and Caddoan most recent and therefore in the uppermost levels. The
Marksville and Coles Creek graphs are gratifying, with Marksville
percentages peaking in Level 6 along with high levels of dart points
and chipped stone tools and before the rise in arrow projectiles; and
with Coles Creek percentages peaking in Level 4, after the advent of
arrow projectiles and the fall-off in dart points and heavy stone
tools. Tchefunete sherds are respectably represented in Levels 7 and
6 but the persistence in Level 5 and increase in Level 4, after Marksville peaks, can only be explained by mistyping or upward transport
of sherds; we prefer the latter explanation. The real difficulty lies in
the Caddoan sherd graph and the nmnber of identifiable Caddoan
sherds, 81, augments the difficulty. There is a lot of difference in the
upward displacement of 6 to 12 Tchefunete sherds and the downward
displacement of 50 Caddoan sherds, well over half of the total number, from the expected Levels 3 and 4 down to Levels 6, 7 and 8. In
order to eliminate the possibility of typing errors, we regraphed the
unquestioned Caddoan sherds, choosing only bottle spouts and en-

90

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

graved sherds; with this maneuver the only significant alteration of
the graph was the elimination of the two sherds from Level 8. There
was still a peak in Level 6 and good representation in Levels 5 and 7.
These sherds were well scattered (Table 5, Fig. 20 B) and there
were no evidences of their being in cache or refuse pits. The numerous recounted evidences of vertical sherd displacement at this
site preclude any firm conclusions, but it would indeed be surprising
if rodents had the discrimination necessary to move Tchefuncte sherds
upward and Caddoan sherds downward. This finding with respect to
Caddoan ceramics at Resch Site emphasizes the significance of the
Caddoan sherds found in Marksville period mounds at the Coral
Snake (McClurkan, Field and Woodall 1966) and Jonas Short (Jelks
1965) sites. This also points to the need for further studies of Caddoan
beginnings in the Sabine and Angelina drainages.
The inverse relationship between dart and arrow projectiles shown
in Fig. 9.1 A is borne out by the percentage graphs in Fig. 29.. However, total dart points are in larger percentage in Level 7 than are
total sherds; the dart points peak at this level, in comparison with
the sherd peak in Level 6. The Gary points more closely parallel total
sherds in Levels 5 through 7 and persist in respectable numbers in
the upper levels as arrow points come in. Separate graphs were made
for the Gary typical, Gary small, Gary tiny and for the individual
varieties (Table 4). These are not shown in Fig. 29, because the only
variations from the graphs of Gary points occur in the Gary ty~)ical
and in those varieties whose numbers are too small to give reliable
results. The graphs for Gary small and Gary tim! are virtually identical at all levels, suggesting that the artificial dividing line between
these two groups, which we established at a length of 3 em., is of
no real value and that they should be considered together as Gary
small, with a range in length of 2 to 4.5 em. Gary typical may be
slightly earlier at this site, consistent with findings elsewhere that
Gary points diminish in size with passage of time. The graph of Gary
tppical showed a peak of 317o in Level 7, with 1770 in Level 6 and
27.570 in Level 5; there were no Gary typical in Levels 1 and 2. Possibly more significant is that 6570 of Gary tylgical were made of petrified wood, compared with 4070 of Gary small and 18.27o of Gary tin~!.
The small numbers of Gary typical, 29 total, interfere with complete
reliance on these differences.
Graphs of the Gary varieties similarly show that those represented
by sufficiently large numbers, like varieties emory, kemp and kaufman,
show frequency graphs which are almost identical with each other
and with the graphs for Gary points in Fig. 22; all are represented in

THE

Level 8, increase in Level 7, peak in Level 6 and progressively drop
thereafter. Varieties emory and kemp are so closely similar in range
of size (Table 4), in vertical distribution in the midden, and in the
materials from which they were made (35 and 33goo of petrified wood,
respectively) that, at this site, the distinction appears to be an artificial one. Variety colfax peaks in frequency in Level 7 and may therefore be slightly earlier; runge, panna maria and hobson peak at Levels
6, 5 and 4, respectively, but their numbers are small.
Further study of the individual dart point types shows that Ellis,
Palmillas, Yarbrough and Kent types appear early and drop off rapidly
above Level 6 (Fig. 22). These types are largely responsible for the
peak percentage of total dart points at Level 7. Ellis type has a total
percentile distribution more nearly resembling that of Gary type; the
other three are confined largely to the lower levels. If there was an
Archaic occupation before advent of pottery, these projectile point
types were represented, especially since one specimen each of Palmillas, Kent and Ellis were from Level 9, where Gary was missing.
The arrow point graphs show that Friley, the predominant type,
generally resembles the total arrow points in vertical distribution,
although Cliffton and Colbert seem to be slightly earlier. The numbers
are too few to draw firm conclusions.
The vertical distribution of chipped stone tools (Table 6, Fig. 9.2)
is almost identical with Gary type projectile points, except for the
presence of two of these tools from Level 9. Thin bifacial tools, often
but improperly termed blades or knives (Table 6), follow a similar
distribution, with a peak at Level 6; large ovate "blades" may be
slightly earlier, as they are present in Levels 8 to 6 and none thereafter, but the numbers are small. The graph of rectangular slabs
"(Fig. 22) shows a peak at Level 6 but persistence to Level 3. The
distribution of thick bifacial tools is similar to that of chipped stone
tools in general, but the peak in frequeney occurs in Level 7 rather
than Level 6. The graph of pointed pebble tools (Fig. 22) shows a
peak at Level 7 with slow declines through Level 4. Unless there was
a larger pre-pottery Archaic occupation of this site than the excavation evidences and provenience studies indicate, most or all of these
chipped stone tools, as well as dart points of late Archaic types, continued in use after the advent of pottery.
The small flake tools have a somewhat different distribution pattern
(Fig. 22, Table 6). They are confined largely to Levels 5, 6 and 7
with peak incidence in Level 6. By contrast, ground stone tools (Table
6), represented in Fig. 22 by the graph of pitted stones, are distributed at al! levels but peak at Level 4 and continue in significant hum-

bers into Level 3. The polished and exotic objects are not included
in Fig. 9.9. because of small numbers, but Table 6 shows the grooved
axes to be in Levels 8 and 9, and the remainder to occur in Levels
7 through 5. There is a significant paucity of polished, ornamenta!,
exotic or presumably eeremonial items at the site.
A study of the flake debitage by levels (Fig. 22, Table 6), with
the horizontal distribution studies (Table .5) previously reported,
shows a smooth pattern which is our best evidence of occupation
density. The surprise is the upward shift of the graph, with the peak
at Level 5 and large numbers of flakes in the upper 3 levels, findings
which are inconsistent with the distribution of projectile points and
other chipped stone artifaets. In the absence of artifact collecting from
the site, we have no explanation for the difference in density of flakes
and other objeets in the upper levels.
In counting the flakes a separate count was made of petrified wood
flakes, since many projectile points and tools at the site were made of
this material; total flakes and flakes of petrified wood were recorded
separately for each level and square. The overall percentage of petrified wood among the flakes is 21.2, but the significant finding in the
flake study is the progressive deerease, level by level and almost
mathematically exact, in the percentage of petrified wood flakes from
the bottom to the top of the midden (Table 7). From frequencies of
30g at Levels 8 and 9 and 26.8go at Level 7, this material diminishes
among the flakes to 19.8go by Level 4, and 16.2~o in Levels 1-2. The
large numbers involved and the straight line changes preclude this
being an aeeidental finding and assure the reliability of its refleeting
a ehange in preference on the part of the inhabitants, from petrified
wood to local cherts, with the passage of time. We then tabulated
the frequencies and pereentages of petrified wood among the materials
from whieh various objects were made, by levels (Table 7). Considerable variation is exhibited from level to level, especially when the
numbers of objeets is small, but the same general trend of diminishing
use of petrified wood as a material for manufaeture of projeetile
points and tools, from lower to upper levels, is shown.
Probably more significant than the level to level ehange in a given
type of object is the evidenee of variation between types of objeets
in the i~ereentage of petrified wood, shown in the column on the right
side of Table 7. The highest percentage oeeurs in dart points other
than Gary type (46.5~) and in large chipped tools (44.57oo) ; Gary
points are next with 39.1% and the lowest frequencies occur in arrow
points (30.4g) and small flake tools (16.2%). There is excellent eorrelation between these findings and the stratigraphie evidenees, pre-

viously discussed and shown in Table 6 and Fig. 22, that thick bifacial
and uniiacial tools and dart points reach peak numbers early (Level
7) and drop off in upper levels; that Gary points apparently persist
longer and peak later than Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent and Ellis;
that arrow points are in higher levels and therefore are presumably
later than Gary dart points; and that small flake tools peak at Level 6
and therefore presumably are popular at a later time than the thicker
tools. A further individual check on materials from which the dart
points, other than Gary type, were made shows the following percentages of petrified wood; Yarbrough, 66.7Z; Kent, 61.9; Palmillas,
56.2; Elam, 50; Ellis, 28.8. Stratigraphic studies at other sites have
shown Yarbrough, Palmfllas and Kent to precede Gary type in time,
even more clearly than the stratigraphy does at Resch Site (Fig. 22).
The low percentage of petrified wood in Ellis type may result from
technological reasons-it may have been more difficult to produce the
typical corner notching with petrified wood than with cherts, and
elsewhere local cherts seem to have been the favorite material for
the manufacture of these points. A similar technological preference
may apply to other types of objects at Reseh Site, to account for the
preferential use of petrified wood almost exclusively to produce the
flat slabs, and of chert almost exclusively to make pointed pebble
tools. A similar explanation is probable for the infrequent use of petrified wood to make small flake tools. Generally, however, it seems
safe to assume that the earlier inhabitants of the site used petrified
wood nearly as often as they did cherts, flints or quartzites in the
manufacture of their tools, leaving many flakes of this material from
the manufacture or resharpening of the tools, whereas later inhabitants showed an increasing preference for other materials.
We have applied this assumption as a check on the various areas
at the site, divided as indicated in Table 5. The percentages of petrified wood among the total flakes are as follows: NE quadrant, 97.4;
East area, 23.6; "other areas," 22.2; SE quadrant, 22; SW quadrant,
19.3; NW quadrant 18.5; North area, 17.4Z. We do not have good
indicators of other kinds for all of these areas, but we have noted
that the NE quadrant has a higher yield of dart projectiles and
chipped stone tools than others; that the East area seemed to have
evidence of more occupation during earlier than later times; and that
the North area showed the reverse, with more evidence of later occupation. These are ephemeral judgments but they do correlate with
the flakes to indicate that, at this site, percentages of petrified wood
among flakes, projectile points and most chipped stone tools are
good indicators of relative age.

RADIOCARBON DETERMINATIONS
Samples of charred nut hulls and small wood charcoal were submitted to the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, University of Texas, through E. Mott Davis. The decision was made to
use the charred nuts since they presumably were deposited during the
aboriginal occupation. Each sample was made up of materials from
several squares but identical levels, in most eases adjacent squares
near the origin of grid (Fig. 20 A). Specimens from Levels 3 and 4
were combined to make an adequate sample; similarly specimens
from Levels 7 and 8 were combined for an adequate sample from the
lower levels. The specimens had been collected with a minimum of
handling, labelled by square and depth, and carefully wrapped in foil
until submission. Results were reported as follows (Radiocarbon
1968: 393-4)
Tx-482 Resch Site, Levels 3 and 4 2250Â±140, or 300 B.C.
Comment: date earlier than expected.
Tx-484 Reseh Site, Level 5 2360Â±130, or 410 B.C.
Comment: earlier than anticipated from this level, which should
not date before Marksville times.
Tx-481 Resch Site, Level 6 2150Â±100, or 200 B.C.
Comment: date consistent with occurrence of Tchefuncte sher~s
on this level, but by stratigraphy should be earlier than Tx-482
and Tx-484.
Tx-483 Resch Site, Level 7 and 8 1850-+-90, or 100 A.D.
Comment: too recent in view of dates from higher levels and
indications of pre-Tchefuncte or Tchefuncte time range.
General Comment: dates are generally satisfactory in that the
major occupation is on Tchefuncte and Marksville time levels, judging from trade sherds. Vagaries in distribution of sherds and of
charred nut hulls from which dates were obtained are explainable
by aboriginal churning of light sand midden and subsequent heavy
gopher disturbance.
Other comparatively recent radiocarbon dates are pertinent to the
Resch Site. Listed by periods, they are as follows:

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The Resch site is a small occupation area of only a few acres on a
minor stream in East Texas. Yet the residual artifacts show occupation
during every known major culture period from Archaic to Caddoan.
By direct evidence of radiocarbon dating from the site the occupation
extended from 400 B.C. to 1O0 A.D., which spans the Tehefuncte and
part of the Marksvflle periods of the lower Mississippi Valley, according to present concepts. The latter part of the site occupation has

THE

RESCH

SITE

97

materials from Troyville, Coles Creek and early Caddoan; numerous
radiocarbon datings have established the latter at approximately
1000-1200 A.D. Moreover, if the 1Resch Site had pre-ceramie occupation in late or middle Archaic times, as seems likely from stratigraphie
and technological evidences, the span of occupation at the site is
somewhere between two and four thousand years.
The second point of concern is with density of occupation. All
evidences, direct and inferential, are of light occupation at all times.
There were no dense concentrations of ceramic or lithie objects;
there is an average of only one artifact from each 9 to 10 cubic feet of
midden; the yield of artifacts was no more than 1 to 2 per year of total
occupation, if this had been continuous, from an excavated area of
7200 square feet or 1/6 acre. Even if there were 5 acres of equally
occupied area, which is not the ease, this would amount to only 30 to
60 sherds or stone objects left on the entire site per year of occupation, much less than one family would be expected to lose. There
were no evidences of well-eonstrueted houses or prepared firebeds,
only 5 small pieces of daub and a like number of mud-dauber nest
fragments, suggesting an absence of permanent habitations. No burials
were found and there is a paucity of ornaments and ceremonial
objects. The forced inference is of brief occupations by small groups,
probably no more than family or extended family size, but returning
time after time. The further inference is of seasonal visits to the site,
never a permanent habitation, for a special purpose and by succeeding
generations over centuries of time. Certain permanent natural attractions, seasonal in nature, are inferred.
This major attraction must have been a reliable food source. During
most of the site occupation, these were foraging peoples, away from
the seacoast or large lakes and therefore exploiters of forest economy.
Even after pottely came in, horticulture or incipient agriculture was
probably less important than natural food sources and evidences elsewhere indicate that only during Coles Creek-Mississippian-Caddoan
times, which would be the last few hundred years of the siteâs occupation, did corn-bean-squash agriculture become the paramount way of
life. For a foraging people, major food-gatherin~ activities are hunting, trapping and netting of animals or birds, fishing, shellfish gathering, the digging of roots and tubers, and the collecting of seeds, fruits
and nuts. Fish and shellfish could not have been the attraction at
this site. Roots and tubers were never known to be a major food source
in the Southeast, and opportunities for hunting or fowling were probably about the same elsewhere in the region as at this site-probably
better for migratory waterfowl on the Sabine than here. But we do

98

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

have evidences that nut-gathering may have been the attraction at this
site: (1) there is a variety of edible native nuts in the valley at
present, including acorns, hickory nuts, walnuts, pignuts, native pecans
and chinquapins (dwarf chestnuts). This variety must have been
available during aboriginal times, as oak and hickory are the climax
forest throughout the Southeastern uplands, replacing pines whenever
conditions are favorable, and the number and variety now present
suggest that this replacement along the small streams and dissected
hills of this valley occurred many centuries ago. (2) The chief food
residue in the midden is charred nut hulls, of hickory, walnut and pignut. (3) Pitted stones which we believe to relate to nutting (theories
that they were capstones for fire drills or stone drills have no special
application at this site; no drilled objects were found), are the most
numerous ground stone objects at the site, distributed throughout the
midden and equal in numbers to the combined total of mortars, mullers and hammerstones. Their number almost equals that of the thin
blades, presumed cutting tools (63 versus 86).
The projectiles, cutting, chopping and scraping tools at tleseh Site
indicate that the peoples carried on their usual huntin~ activities during their residence at the site, as might be expected. Conditions were
probably favorable for a variety of activities, as suggested in the
discussion of flora and fauna of the area. But we suggest that autumnal
nut-gathering, in an environment which was favorable for collateral
hunting and gathering of other kinds, was the attraction which
brought peoples to the same site for so long a time. The site is on one
of the larger tributaries of the Sabine leading up into the rolling hills,
on a favorably located high terrace immediately by the stream and at
the level where the valley suddenly widens out and several smaller
streams enter. If an occasional family lingered at the site, after horticulture was established, the sand soil was suitable for garden crops; it
is possible that this happened in Caddoan times, as we have seen that
evidences of Caddoan occupation were more widespread over the
site than those of some other periods.
Who were the peoples who visited the site? Initially they were
probably Archaic people, despite the finding of pottery sherds in the
lowest midden levels. This is inferred because of the stratigraphie
frequencies (Fig. 9,2) and identity of artifacts with those found in
pre-pottery levels of sites like Yarbrough (Johnson 1962). Grooved
axes, projectile point types Yarbrough, Yantis, Pahnillas and Kent,
and thick chipped stone bifacial and unifaeial tools, all of which were
established types by middle Archaic times, were found in the lowest
midden levels or the subiaeent sand. All of these peak in frequency

(Fig. 22) before Gary points and pottery sherds. Occasional visits to
the site by mid-Archaic peoples, presumably as early as 2000 B.C., are
suggested. The high frequency of other Archaic projectile types and
tools in Level 7 indicates increased usage during late Archaic times
(Table 8). The inventory of this late Archaic occupation (Table 6)
corresponds to that of La Itarpe Aspect.
When pottery-making peoples began to frequent the site, they were
still using Archaic tool and projectile point types; they were making
simple jars and bowls, usually undecorated except for occasional lip
notching or infrequent incised and punctated decoration. These were
flat or round bottomed, never conoidal-base vessels, and were tempered with sand, bone or clay, individually or in mixtures. As trine
passed, sand tempering became less frequent but these tempering
traditions persisted in this valley down to the time of European contact. Deeper jars, tecomate-like constricted orifice vessels and "flowerpot"-shaped vessels were made later. These simple wares, which persisted for centuries as the basic culinary vessels, were similar to types
called Bear Creek Plain of the lower Sabine and Angelina areas, if
sand-tempered, and to the ware called Williams Plain, found through
much of East Texas, eastern Oklahoma and into Arkansas and Louisiana, in clay and bone-tempered ceramics. The early pottery-making
people of Resch site were still basically in a forest-exploiting economy
of hunting and gathering, used the atlatl and dart, tipped the darts
with stone points which had contracting stems and were made of local
materials, cherts and petrified wood; rarely they had flints from central
Texas or quartzites from Arkansas. Similar local materials were used
to make a variety of crude tools and a few well-made thin blades
(Table 8); a progressive preference for cherts instead of petrified
wood was shown. Most of their tools apparently related to hunting

or grinding (seeds) or nutting; wood-working tools like adzes or
gouges were rare, as were drills and gravers, and any manufacturing
other than of basic tools was minimal. These people were attending
to the business of food gathering and everyday living with few fiâills,
even of ornamentation (other than red oeher) or eeremonia! nature.
Into this drab basic technology ideas or items of pottery-making
were introduced from the lower Mississippi Valley, presumably
making their way aeross the coast to the Sabine River and up this
stream to the site. Typieal Tchefuncte pottery (Fig. 9, 10) with linear
triangle stamping, drag-and-jab incising, nail pinehing, ring and
polypodal basal supports and extended bases, tempered with clay or
sand, were brought in. The specimens available offer no clue to the
site of manufacture of this ware, whether locally, on the eoast, or in
the lower valley, but sites of the Tchefunete period are known on "the
lower Sabine.
By the next period, however, vessels with Marksville decoration
appear, some of them made of pastes in the local fashion of bone tempering and use of clays with hematite impurities. Incising, stamping
in bands outlined by deeply trailed lines, the use of serrated or
"dentate" tools, and characteristic shapes are indicative of these
wares (Fig. 10). Heavy trailed incising of large bone-tempered vessels
may have started at this time or a little later. Archaic technology in
manufacture of everyday tools and projectile points was unchanged,
except for a more limited variety (Table 8); most of the points were
Gary or Ellis types. Grinding and nutting tools increased in usage and
probably exotic objects like quartz crystals and galena were brought
in. The small polished stone cups were probably made at this trine, if
we may judge by customs elsewhere during this period; the placement

102

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

of these objects in the midden allows for this interpretation. The Coral
Snake Mound, 75 miles downstream from Resch site, attests to the
presence of people with Marksville culture located well up the Sabine
River.
There are ephemeral evidences that the succeeding culture period
in the lower Mississippi Valley, Troyville, was represented at tlesch
site. Sherds which were stmnped with a straight bar instead of a
notched tool (Fig. 10 k-n) and one sherd each of Yokena Incised and
Churupa Punetated are types which are more often attributed to Troyville than to Marksville ceramic complex, although these decorative
elements are present in both.
A major change now becomes evident at the site (Table 8), with
the introduction of the bow and arrow and a rapid decrease in dart
projectile points as well as chipped stone tools. We cannot say with
certainty whether these occurred at the time of introduction of Troyville or of Coles Creek ceramics, in view of the small number of
distinctive sherds and the vertical sherd displacement in the midden.
We do know that the middle midden levels, 4 and 5, mark the peak
of Coles Creek sherds, that arrow points are established at these
levels, and that Archaic dart points and thiek cutting-chopping tools
are fading out. Grinding and pitted stones increase and the inference is
of lessened dependence on hunting aetivities. Presumably agriculture
had arrived, but the nature of oecupation at the site, light and ostensibly sporadic, seems unehanged and the site was probably still used
as a nut-gathering station.
The final occupation of the site was by early Caddoan peoples, of
Alto Focus affiliation (Table 8). They frequented the site snore than
had the Coles Creek people and may have coexisted with them, if
we may put any reliance on sherd stratigraphy. They were the best
potters at the site, introducing the bottle and carinated bowl forms
and, along with the Coles Creek potters, snaking jars with high and
outward flaring rims. Decoration with a variety of techniques included
the innovations of brushing and engraving. However, they maintained
the bone, clay and sand tempering traditions, using them in this order
of frequency. A lesser but still considerable number of vessels were
plain and "flowerpot" vessels were still made. How much Archaic
technology persisted in the manufacture of tools is conjectural, as the
evidence at this site is unclear, but it was minimal if present. They
were using the bow with anâows which were tipped with small flake
points, but small Gary points may still have been used at times.
There seems no doubt that the use of pitted stones and other ground
stone tools was still in vogue, that nuts were still roasted, and there

THE

I~ESCH

SITE

is no evidence that their usage of the site differed from that of the
former peoples.
The early Caddoan occupation of the site terminated its aboriginal
occupation; thereafter it remained deserted until European settlement. Occupation of the valley continued, however, and the occupation now seems to have been in permanent small settlements by Caddoan peoples, with mound-building and burials in mounds and cemeteries. In succession, the Old Brown Place, the two sites on Jones
Ranch, Reseh Burial Mound, Susie Slade site and Henry Brown sites
1 and 2 show shifting but continuous occupation during middle and
late Caddoan times. They shifted in use of the valley from seasonal
visits to continuous occupation in small settlements but their pottery
shows continuity with the Reseh site in the use of bone and grit tempering in the pastes, hence we infer no advent of new peoples. Fully
developed agriculture is to be assumed, with cessation of the annual
round.
In conclusion, trends of significance which we infer at this site are:
(1) usage of the site over thousands of years as a specialized area in
the forest-exploiting economy, for the primal7 purpose of gathering
nuts; (2) the persistence of Archaic tool and projectile point typology,
and presumably of basic food-gathering techniques, for centuries after
introduction of pottery; (3) the development of an areal ceramic
tradition, beginning before the time of Christ, with simple vessel
forms, flat or rounded bases, largely plain but a small amount deeorated, made of paste tempered with sand, bone and clay, which
tradition lasted long after introduction of more sophisticated ceramics;
(4) introduction in sequence of the ceramic complexes of the lower
Mississippi Valley, from Tehefuncte through Coles Creek, into this
area of east Texas, presumably via coastal spread and up the Sabine
River; (5) eventual replacement of Archaic traditions and teehnology
by the bow and arrow, agriculture and small tool technology and (6)
desertion of the site after early Caddoan times, as permanent settlements elsewhere in the valley with mound building, ceremonial
activities and cemetery burial, centered around an agricultural economy replaced the seasonal round and dependence on forest exploitation.

Rattlesnake Shelter: 41CX29
AARON D. RInGs, JR.
ABSTRACT
The author excavated a small shelter within the bank of an intermittent
stream in northwestern Crockett County in the summer of 1968. Burned
rocks, ash, flakes, scrapers, and a bifaee foliate were found. The author was
unable to assign the artifact assemblage to a particular time period.

INTRODUCTION
The author is indebted to Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Barkes of Midland for
the contour map. I am happy to thank the following people who made
the exeavation possible: Mr. Arnold E. Sommer of Midland for his
companionship and assistance during the excavation; the O. W.
Parker family for permission to excavate; and Mr. Burton Lanehart
of Iraan for his interest and his maintenanee of transportation equipment. Mr. C. S. Parker of Lubboek brought the site to the attention of
the author. Dr. Joel L. Shiner, SMU Anthropology Research Center,
offered eneouragement in the preparation of the report.
In 1966, the Texas Areheologieal Society held its annual sunnner
field school at the Dunlap Site, twenty-two miles southeast of Rattlesnake Shelter. A badly disturbed rockshelter, two burned rock middens
in the draw below the shelter, and two other nearby shelters were
tested. The results of the excavation have not been published.
Field work under the supervision of Dessamae Lorrain of Southern
Methodist University was conducted at the Meadows Shelter, Walters
Site, Chimney Shelter, and Rivas Site in November, 1966, and at the
Sotol Site in May and June, 1967 (Lorrain, 1968:5).
The excavation of Rattlesnake Shelter was the fifth in a series of
systematic tests conducted on the O. W. Parker Ranch in northwestern
Crockett County, Texas. Previous archeologieal researeh reported
sandals, knotted fibers, fire hearth sticks, scrapers, and projectile points
from a shelter, Site 41CX10 (Riggs, 1968A:41). A midden excavation
recovered Langtry projectile points and other artifacts at Site 41CXll
(Riggs, 1968B:76-82). An excavation of a ring midden which yielded
an Ensor projectile point was discussed by Sommer at the Fourth Regional Areheologieal Symposium for Southeastern New Mexico and
Western Texas. Riggs (1968C:2-9) reports a variety of projectile
point types (including Plainview, Langtry, Pandale, Ahnagre, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Perdiz, Bonham, and Toyah) from an apparently
mixed context at Shelter 41CX12.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

PHYSICAL SETTING
Northwestern Crockett County is desert plateau country modified
by the action of the Peeos River and its tributaries in downcutting
valleys through the resistant eaprock of the Edwards Plateau (Lorrain, 1968:6).
The climate is mild. The January low average temperature is 38
degrees F., the July average high temperature is 95 degrees F. (Texas
Almanac, 1966-67:117). The rainfall average at Ozona is 14.90 inches
per year. The crisp, dry, warm days are followed by eool nights.
Plant life characteristic of deserts is common here. Vegetation on the
plateau tops is dominated by sotol, leehuguilla, and significant
amounts of sacahuiste, guajillo, and various grasses. The base of the
eaprock has hackberry, buekeye, and catclaw in dense growth where
greater moisture is present. In the valley, the more common vegetation
includes creosote bush, mesquite, screwbean, and cacti. Juniper and
Texas mountain laurel provided shade at the edge of the shelter.
The fauna is diverse. Mammals commonly found in the area today
include the white-tail deer, javelina, ringtail, skunk, fox, jack rabbit,
ground squirrel, cottontail, and several speeies of small rodents. Numerous species of birds and reptiles are present in the area.
The present economy depends almost entirely upon the oil industry
and on sheep and goat ranching.
RATTLESNAKE SHELTER
Rattlesnake Shelter, named for a former occupant, is a small, shallow rockshelter. It is near the head of a small tributary canyon of an
intermittent stream which enters the Pecos River about three miles
to the west. Maximum width is 16.0 meters, maximum depth is 2.9
meters, and maximum height of the ceiling is 1.9 meters. The western
portion average ceiling height is .9 meter, considerably reduced by
a projecting ledge. There was a small burned rock talus in front of
the eastern portion of the shelter. The stream bank at the eenter of
the shelter was bare sloping limestone bedrock. The ceiling was
blackened from smoke. The floor at the center of the shelter is 1.4
meters above the present stream bed. Figure 2 is a eross-seetion of
the shelter.
TECHNIQUE
A site survey report form was recorded with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin, and assigned the Site Number
41CX29 as a means of identification.

A bench mark was established on the terrace across the intermittent

the aid of a plane table and telescopic alidade. A grid system was
established that would provide six squares one meter by one meter
to test the fill in the eastern portion of the shelter. The western portion
had a marked decrease in ceiling height and was not tested.
Excavation was conducted by picking the rocks flee, removing
larger rocks by hand, and passing the remaining fill over a one-quarter inch mesh wire screen.
Records were kept by square. The fill containing artifacts was less
than twenty centimeters in thickness and was thoroughly mixed as

plotted on the contour map.
Artifacts were washed and labeled by site number and assigned
catalog numbers.
The bedrock floor was brushed dean, checked for usage, and

THE FILL
Towards the rear of the shelter there were two layers making up
the fill. Lying on the bedrock with no cultural debris was a 9,0 em.
layer of light limestone dust and spalls mixed with goat and sheep
dung. This layer was topped by a thin layer of compacted goat and
sheep dung. Near the back line of the outward squares the two zones
or layers graded into one layer of dark limestone dust and spalls, goat
and sheep dung, ash, burned limestone fragments, and lithie material.

DISCUSSION
Previous archeological investigations on the O. W. Parker Ranch
had produced a mixture of cultural material from the lower Pecos
l{iver area with that from central Texas and a smaller amount from
the South Plains.
Rattlesnake Shelter, indicating a limited amount of use, offered the
possibility of being an unmixed cultural occupation. This may or may
not have been the ease.
Few chronological changes have been reported for chipped stone
artifacts other than projectile points. It is not because the other artifacts are considered unimportant, but, simply because of the limited
available information about them. Each archeologist has classified
scrapers and knives somewhat differently. The terms used in this
report follow that of SMU as the artifacts were sent there for analysis.

RATTLESNAKE

117

SHELTER

None of the lithic material excavated can serve, at least at the present
time, to identify a culture or to assign the artifact assemblage to a
particular time period.
Excavation indicates a limited amount of occupation in the east end
of the shelter near the drip line, Nearly all of the occupational debris
was recovered from the front row of squares. This could be the result
of periodic cleaning of the shelter either by the occupants or by
stream flooding.
The lack of perishables, either animal or vegetal remains, is suggestive of periodic flooding of the shelter by the adjacent stream. This
periodic flooding, or the fear of its happening, could account for a
limited use of the shelter.

Two Prehistoric Cemetery Sites in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas
ABSTRACT
Under this heading, data from two prehistoric cemetery sites in Cameron
and Hidalgo Counties, Texas, are presented. The papers were written separately. Part I deals with salvage archeology conducted at the Floyd Morris
Site (41 CF 2) in Cameron County; this paper was authored by Michael
B. Collins, Thomas Roy Hester and Frank A. Weir. The second paper
reports additional materials recovered from tbe Ayala Site (41 HG 1) in
Hidalgo County-; an earlier report on this site was published by Campbell
and Frizzell (1949), while the present paper (Part II) was prepared by
Thomas Roy Hester and Frederick Ruecking, Jr. Part III was written by
Hester; it discusses the Floyd Morris and Ayala Sites in relation to the known
prehistoric burial practices along the lower Texas coast and in the Rio
Grande Valley.

INTRODUCTION AND SITE DESCRIPTION
In June of 1966, while leveling his field to improve irrigation, Mr.
Floyd A. Morris of Harlingen exposed several human bones, and
recognizing their possible importance, notified Mr. Bob Diekson of
KGBT-TV, Harlingen. Mr. Diekson informed the Department of
Anthropology, The University of Texas, of the finds, and a crew of
three students (Frank A. Weir, Gentry Steele, and Michael B. Collins) was dispatched under the auspices of the Texas Areheological
Research Laboratory to salvage a portion of the site. Excavations
were conducted from June 8 through June 12, during which time 11
burials were salvaged, 7 highly disturbed burials were investigated,
and 7 miscellaneous features were recorded.
It is the feeling of the authors that in southern Texas the oversimplified scheme whieh proposes an Archaic stage eharacterized by
the use of dart points followed by a Neo-American stage characterized
by the use of arrowpoints is in need of revision. However, it would be
inappropriate to initiate such revision in the present deseriptive paper,
and therefore we have adhered to the cultural definitions for southern
Texas as presented by Suhm and others (1954) and MaeNeish (1958).

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

Cemeteries seem to be an important element in certain prehistoric
cultures of the Texas coast and the lower l~io Grande Valley. Some of
these sites include Ayala (Campbell and Frizzell, 1959; Hester and
tluecking, this issue), Caplen (Campbell, 1957), Oso (A. T. Jackson,
field notes), Odem (Jack Hughes, field notes), Jamaica Beach (excavated by the Houston Museum of Natural Science), Dietz (Hester,
1969a), and one on Matagorda Island (Martin, 1929). Unfortunately,
most of these sites had been badly disturbed before subsequent
investigation and research could be carried out by professional archeologists. Additionally, few of these sites have produced much areheological data. Only through the investigation of several additional
such sites will it eventually be possible to place this burial practice
into some cultural perspective. As this paper indicates, many of the
preferred locations of cemeteries are the slight elevations that will
be destroyed by future land-leveling. We feel that there is a need for
a systematic archeologieal survey and testing program in those areas of
the lower Rio Crande Valley where extensive irrigation improvements
are planned.
The Floyd Morris site is located 2 miles north of Harlingen (in
Cameron County) on the Briggs-Coleman tract. It occupies a portion
of a low, sandy-clay ridge about one-fourth mile long (north-south)
and 500 feet wide. Originally, the ridge extended perhaps six feet
above the surrounding land surface, but at present, it has been
lowered about three or three and one-half feet. An elongate, shallow
depression extends from southeast of the ridge past the south end
and along the east side; evidently this depression is a remnant of an
old stream meander and the ridge is an associated dune. At the present time, the ridge is under cultivation and an irrigation canal follows
the course of the depression. A north-south property line at the top
of the ridge divides it into two halves; only the eastern half was being
leveled and evidence of aboriginal use of the locality was exposed in
the lowered area for a distance of about 600 feet north-south and
from 100 to 300 east-west.
In order to level the eastern portion of the ridge, Mr. Morris was
removin~ fill from the higher (west) side of his field and spreading
some of it over the lower (east) side and disposing of the remainder in
a depression west of the ridge. In the west half of the field, where
more fill had been removed, the exposed soil consisted of dark-colored
clay with a limited amount of sand, but in the east half of the field,
the exposed deposits were light-colored sandy clays. No bedding was
evident in the excavation walls, suggesting that the material was of
aeolian derivation.

PIIEHISTOIIIC CEMETERY SITES

The occupational features, particularly the burials, were completely
disturbed in the west half of the field due to the removal of more
overburden and only one burial on the east was entirely below the
level of the disturbance. The machinery used in leveling included a
"chisel" and a "buggy." The chisel was the ground-breaking device,
and consisted of several narrow, chisel-like teeth spaced about one
foot apart. The buggy was a large scoop which removed the broken
top soil. The field was broken by two right-angle passes with the
chisel which resulted in severe disturbance of those features in the
plow zone, but, as can be seen in Figure 1 b, small undisturbed
sections of the features remained in blocks of soil outside the path
of the blades. From these undisturbed blocks, we were able to
determine orientation of the skeletons in several of the disturbed
burials.
Certain of the recovered human bones exhibited various degrees
of mineralization and encrustation with calcium carbonate. Although
it is possible that irrigation has contributed to the mineralization and
precipitation of the enerustation, field observations led to the formulation of an hypothesis that the bones with the greater amount of
adhering calcium carbonate were of greater age. The field observations were as follows: (1) within a given burial, each bone exhibited
about the same amount of mineralization and encrustation; (2) horizontal location within the site seemed to have no correlation with
mineralization and encrustation; and, (3) one feature, Burial 11, consisted of the well-preserved, non-mineralized, skeletons of three individuals buried at the same time; the interment of these individuals
caused the disturbance of a previous burial, the bones of which were
heavily mineralized and entrusted. If this hypothesis is tenable, then
perhaps a considerable period of time is represented by the recovered
burials, and intermittent use of the cemetery is implied. It is conceivable that an elevation such as the ridge at the Floyd Morris site was
a preferred burial area that maintained its desirability over a long
period of time.

FEATUIIES
The features are grouped below into three categories: burials, disturbed burials, and miscellaneous features. Burials are those accumulations of human bone for which at least some burial data could be
recorded. Disturbed burials are those accumulations of human bone
that seem to represent burials but from which no burial data could
be derived. Miscellaneous features include accumulations of anima!
bone, a possible midden, and other evidences of occupation. The

recovered skeletal material was badly fragmented and otherwise
poorly preserved. For this reason, few osteometric data were obtained,
and only general osteological observations are reported for each
burial. See Fig. 3 for sketches of burial positions and Fig. 2 for location of features within the site.
THE BURIALS
BURIAL 1. This badly disturbed feature consisted of a fragmentary
right femur shaft, a humerus shaft, and skull fragments, plus a few
miscellaneous bone fragments. Those bones found in place were in
a light-colored sandy clay and suggested that the skeleton had been
flexed (the humerus was near the femur), but the exact position was
not determined. These bones were moderately mineralized and encrusted.
BUR~r. 2. This fairly complete burial (Fig. 3 a) occurred in lightcolored sandy-clay soil. Dark-colored soil immediately surrounded
the bones, and delineated the lower portion of the burial pit. Evidently, the burial pit was oval and measured about 1.1 feet, east to
west, at the elevation of the bones. The skeleton was complete except
for the skull and fragments of the long bones which were removed by
the chisel. The body had been tightly flexed and rested on its right side
with the head to the north; the left arm was folded around the left
leg such that the humerus was above the femur and tibia and the
radius and ulna were beneath the leg bones, that is, between the legs.
Skull fragments and small unidentified bone fragments were found
in the loose soil above the skeleton. None of the bones in Burial 2
were mineralized or coated with calcium carbonate.
The individual was an adolescent, approximately 15 years old at
the time of death, no deciduous teeth are present. Sex was not determined, however, the bones appear to be moderately robust for an
individual of age 15.
BURIAL 3. This multiple grave contained 9. adult individuals in a fair
state of preservation (Fig. 3 b). Individual 3 A lay east of and
slightly beneath individual 3 B. Both were very tightly flexed on their
left sides with pelves to the north and skulls to the south. The skull
of 3 A was removed, and that of 3 B was severely damaged, by the
machinery. The pelvis of each individual was at a slightly lower elevation than the skull; evidently, the bodies originally rested at a
slight inclination. The soil in the vicinity of Burial 3 was dark clay
whereas that immediately surrounding the bones was darker, ahnost
black. These bones were not mineralized and lacked mineral encrustation. There were no associated artifacts. Due to accidental mixture of

the bones in the laboratoly, individuals 3 A and 3 B were not kept
separate, however, it was possible to determine that each was an
adult and that one was male and one was probably female. The
posterior, distal right humerus shaft of one individual exhibits an
area of cortical thickening approximately 7 em. in length.
BurmaL 4. This poorly preserved skeleton of an infant lay 3 feet north
of Burial 3 at approximately the same elevation. It was 2 feet west of
Disturbed Burial 1 and at a slightly lower elevation. Fill was dark
clay. Only shaft and rib fragments were present and these were in
such bad condition that burial orientation and details about age
(other than infancy) and other characteristics of the individual could
not be determined. The bones lacked mineralization and enerustation.
A complex artifact or artifacts accompanied these bones. Present were
perforated canine teeth and Oliva tinklers in a semicircular pattern
suggestive of a necklace (see Fig. 4). These objects were on top of and
between the bones as though they had been placed on top of the body
at the time of burial.
BURIAL 5. This poorly preserved burial (Fig. 3 d) occurred in lightcolored, clayey sand. A slightly darker fill around the bones in an
area 2.0 feet north-south by 1.5 feet east-west apparently represented
the lower portion of the burial pit. The skeleton rested on its left side
and was very tightly flexed with the skull to the north, facing east.
The bones were completely crushed by the land-leveling equipment,
and skeletal data are lacking. There were no associated objects.
BURIAL 6. This burial (Fig. 3 e) occurred in light-colored clayey
sand, no burial pit visible. The skeleton was tightly flexed and rested
on its back but was twisted slightly to the left, giving the impression
of having been placed on its left side. The head was to the south and
faced west. There were no associated artifacts. The heavily mineralized bones were badly disturbed by the chisel and no restoration was
possible. The individual was an adult, cranial synostosis in a stage
indicating an age of 20 years at death; robusticity is suggestive of a
male, but determination was impossible. The partially restored calvaria yielded a maximum length measurement of 181 ram. and a
maximum width of 139, ram., (cranial index, 72.1-doliehoeranic).
Pathology inetudes cortical thickening of the anterior, distal left tibia
shaft and of the anterior distal right tibia shaft as well as near the
midpoint of the medial right tibia shaft.
BURIAL 7. This badly damaged burial (see Fig. 2 b) occurred in lightcolored clayey sand; no burial pit was visible. The skeleton was flexed
with the head to the north and appeared to be resting on its right
side. The bones were heavily mineralized and encrusted with calcium

carbonate. Two tubular bone beads were recovered from soil matrix
around the bones, and, although their exact position in the grave
remains unknown, they are considered valid associations. The individual was an adult and appeared to be a male.
BURIAL 8. This burial (Fig. 3 e) occurred in light-colored clayey sand
just beneath the depth reached by the chisel blades; however, the
skull was crushed and the long bones slightly displaced by the weight
of tractors. The skeleton, that of an adult female, was tightly flexed
on its back and partly twisted to the right. The skull was to the east
and was facing up. There were no grave associations.

BURIAL 9. This badly preserved burial occurred in light-colored, clayey
sand. The bones were heavily coated with calcium carbonate and
mineralized. The skeleton appeared to have been flexed and seems to
be that of a young adult, probably female.
BURIAL 10. This accumulation of very fragmented human bone was
almost entirely removed from plow-loosened soil, however, a few
fragments remained in undisturbed light-colored fill. The bones were
badly fragmented and scattered, precluding observations on burial
form and osteological determination of the individualâs characteristics.
The bones were heavily mineralized and entrusted with calcium
carbonate. Two large disc beads (one of stone and one of shell) were
found with the small bone fragments that lay immediately above
the in situ fragnients and probably were associated with the skeleton.
BURIAL II. This complex feature consisted of two interments at lhe
same location (Figs. 3 f, 5). The first interment was that of one individual (designated 11 A) and the second interment, which caused
the disturbance of the first, involved three individuals (11 B, 11 C,
and 11 D). The skeletal remains of individual 11 A were highly mineralized and consisted of a frontal bone and a few fragmentary postcranial bones, most of which were disinterred by the land leveling
operation. The cranial fragment and some of the post-cranial flagments were found in the undisturbed soil between chisel marks, but
were observed to be out of proper anatomical relationship. In removing fill ffoni around these fragments in an attempt to determine something more about 11 A, the skull of individual 11 B was encountered
at a depth of 0.5 feet below the deepest penetration of the chisel
blades. The bones of individual 11 B were not mineralized or encrusted. As this constituted the only opportunity to investigate a
burial which had escaped destruction by the plow, an attempt was
made to locate the burial pit by scraping a level surface at the base
of the plow zone and another at the level of the skul! of 11 B. Neither
of these scraped surfaces revealed any change in the homogeneous,
light-colored clayey sand which might be construed as indicating the
burial pit. However, the knee joints of individual 11 B were ]ocated
and found to extend up to the plow zone near the in situ bones of
11 A. The spatial relationship of the bones of individual 11 A to those
of 11 B, the greater amount of mineralization and encrustation of the
bones of 11 A, and the fact that 11 A seemed to have been disturbed
prior to the land-leveling, would seem best to be explained by the
proposal that interment of individual 11 B postdated that of 11 h
and that it caused the disturbance of 11 A.
Also interred with individual 11 B were a bundle burial and either

a newborn child or a fetus. Individual 11 B (a young female) rested
on the back with the shoulders and upper back slightly elevated and

130

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

with the legs loosely flexed and spread apart. The skull was to the
southwest and was inclined forward and turned to the left, facing
west; the arms were placed along the sides of the body and were
slightly flexed at the elbows such that the hands rested between the
thighs and above the pelvis.
Resting on the abdominal region and between the arms of 11 B
were the closely spaced, disartieulated bones of an adult male (11 C).
Present were the ealva, severed right and left distal radii, left clavicle,
several rib fragments, and shafts of the following bones: right and
left femora, right and left humeri, right and left fibulae, right and left
ulnae, and left and right radii severed at the distal ends (it is not
certain whether these radii shafts belong with the two distal radii,
but probably they do). All of these bones were coated with a dark
substance and a red pigment. The long bones of 11 C were arranged
in a general east-west pattern and rested directly on the ribs of 11 B.
The ealva and mandible rested on the long bones. Numerous shell
and bone beads rested among the bones of this bundle burial.
Beneath the skull of 11 C and between the innominates of 11 B
were the remains of either a newborn or a fetus (11 D). The position
of the bones did not offer a solution to the problem of whether or not
the individual was unborn-the body may have been inter-uterine
or laid on the abdomen of 11 B at the time of burial and settled
between the innominates (see below).
Individua! 11 A, represented by a fragmentary frontal bone, a distal
humerus shaft, rib fragments, and miscellaneous shaft fragments,
appears to have been an adult; robustieity of certain long bone fragments and the massiveness of the supra-orbita! torus indicates the
male sex. The distal humerus shaft is slightly smaller than would be
expected from the apparent robustieitv of the other bones, and is
possibly of an additional individual, although it and the other bones
of 11 A are all equally heavily mineralized and coated with calcium
carbonate.
Individual 11 B consists of the well-preserved remains of a young
female. Although the various age criteria are not consistent, the age
at death appears to have been between 14 and 18 years, probably
about 15 or 16 (all skeletal maturation other than complete eruption
of the 3rd molars indicates an age of about 15 years). As none of the
long bones exhibits fusion of both epiphyses, length measurements
were not made. The bones are graeile and delicate. Abnormalities
include the following: (1) loss in life of the first right mandibular
molar and subsequent resorption of the alveolous; (9,) extensive apical
caries of the first left mandibular molar; and (3) caries of the maxil-

PREHISTORIC CEMETERY SITES

131

lary right first molar crown, left canine, and left first molar. Also, the
root sections of the third maxillary molars are not fully developed.
Individual 11 C, the bundle burial, was an adult male exhibiting
complete synostosis of all vault sutures; age probably exceeded forty
years. The long bones are robust (see above for list of recovered
bones) as are the ealva and mandible. Skeletal anomalies include a
lesion (cortical thickening without visible periostitis) near the midpoint of the medial side of the right tibia shaft, and slight osteoporosis
in the ealva in the vicinity of bregma. As mentioned, definite human
alteration of the radii in the form of grooving and snapping was
observed. Also~ all of the bones are coated with a dark substance
(asphaltum?) and red pigment and there is a small burned area at
the proxinlal fracture of the right ulna. There are eertain other attributes of the skeletal material that are probably the result of human
alteration, but the evidence is less concrete. The two recovered severed distal radii are well-preserved which gives evidence that the
immediate burial environment would allow survival of bone extremities. Also, the basal and facial regions of the skull include bones
(particularly the temporals) whose absence is not explainable as
non-preservation (see Fig. 6 a). It is not known what treatment these
bones received, but it appears that some activity prior to burial has
resulted in destruction of the lower and facial portion of the skull
as well as the ends of the long bones. The mandible also exhibits
post-mortem alteration which may include intentional, hunlan activities. All teeth, except the roots of the right second premolar and
first molar, have been extracted and there is no evidence of alveolar
resorption. The anterior alveoli from the left premolar to the right
second prenIolar have been destroyed by the removal of a large seetion of bone; the resulting depression is scooped-out and slopes anteriorly (Fig. 6 b). The cause of this alteration of the mandible is
uncertain-it may have been aboriginal or it may have occurred during
excavation. The altered surface is fresher in appearance than the rest
of the bone, but not as fresh as one or two other bones broken at the
time of excavation.
Individual ll D was represented by skull fragments, ineludin~
orbital segments, distal and proximal femur fragments, right and left
distal tibias, distal humerus, rib fragments~ vertebral bodies and proeesses, ealeaneus, fragmentary clavicle, incomplete innominate and incomplete scapula.
This skeletal material was studied by Dr. Robert M. Malina, physical anthropologist at The University of Texas at Austin. His statement follows:

Based upon estimated orbital size and estimated femoral and tibial lengths,
the burial appears to represent an individual in the age range of birth to
six months, perhaps eloser to the lower end of the range.

The possibility that individual 11 D might represent a newborn
infant coupled with the unusual burial situation in which it was found
presents an intriguing question. Ruecking (1955: 132) has noted that
if a Coahuiltecan mother (the Carrizo cluster of the Coahuilteean
linguistic group was present in Cameron County in early historic
times) died during childbirth, the womanâs body "was buried along
with the child, even if the child were alive and well." While no concrete evidence exists that the burials at this site are Coahuilteean, it
is possible that this tradition (of interring a newborn infant with its
dead mother) may have been present in prehistoric times.
Associated with Burial 11 were 402 bone and shell artifacts (in addition to the altered human bones of 1t C described above). These
included 299 tubular bone beads, 18 Marginella shell beads, and 85
Noetia shell beads. The exact provenience of each of these specimens
was not recorded, however, certain beads were in positions which
would indieate something of their placement at the time of burial.
These placements could either reflect locations of individual adornment during life or represent the placement of offerings in the grave.
Both tubular bone and Noetia shell beads were found in the waist
region of individual 11 B, possibly indicative of an ornamented waist
band. One of the tubular bone beads was of hmnan bone and was
found resting on the crest of the right innominate along with 6
Noetia shell beads. Among the bones of 11 C were 29 tubular bone,
1 Marginella shell, and 17 Noetia shell beads. Beneath the skul! of
i1 B was a concentration of tubular bone beads including 4 which
were in line as though strung; evidently, these represent a necklace.
Among the bones of individuals 11 B and 11 C were 265 tubular bone
beads, 17 MarginelIa shell beads and 69. Noetia shell beads for which
specific locations were not recorded.
DISTURBED BURIALS

collected from a small area of disturbed soil 9,,5 feet south of Burial
4 and 2 feet east of Burial 3. The skeleton rested at a slightly higher
elevation than those of Burials 3 and 4 and was completely disturbed.
No burial position was determined and no artifaets seem to have been

associated. The bones were flee of mineral replacement and encrustation.
DISTURBED BURIAL 2. This feature was 14 small fragments of human
bone found in the plow zone; one complete phalange was also collected.
DISTURBED BUBIAL 3. A few fragmentary bones of an adult human plus
some animal bone fragments and a lump of burned clay were collected from the loose soil of the plow zone. All bone was heavily
mineralized and encrusted. Evidently, there were no objects assodiated with the skeleton.
DISTURBED BUltIAL 4. This feature consisted of heavily mineralized and
encrusted human bone fragments, evidently of one adult, found in
the plow-loosened soil; no associated artifacts were found.
DISTURBED BUltlAL 5. A very few heavily mineralized and enerusted
hmnan bones which had been badly scattered by the plow were
collected from this disturbed feature. No skeletal data were derived,
nor were any associations noted.
DISTUI1BED BURIAL 6. This feature consisted of a few fragments of
human bone found in disturbed soil. The bones were moderately
mineralized and seemed to be of an adult.
DISTURBED BURIAL 7. a few small scattered human bone fragments
occurred at this location in the loosened soil; none yielded any
osteologieal data.
MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES
In Fig. 1, the locations of seven miscellaneous features are indicated. Most of these consist of localized concentrations of burned
and/or mineralized animal bone fragments (mainly deer). At Miscellaneous Feature 7, a considerable quantity of ash and charcoal were
mixed with loose soil and a small shell disc bead was collected from
the surface.
CHIPPED STONE AtlTIFACTS
TOBTUGAS DABT POINT (Fig. 7 b: 1 specimen)
Description: The specimen is triangular, with convex lateral edges

width (at the base) is 94 ram., and it is approximately 7 ram. in
maximum thickness. This specimen was co!lected from the site by
the landowner, and its exact provenience is uncertain.
Discussion: While the Tortugas type is generally considered Archaic
in age (Suhm and others, 1954: 489.), it is possible that projectile
points of this size persisted in southern Texas until the Neo-American

large Brownsville complex sites in Cameron County (A. E. Anderson

I~([ATA1VIOIqOS

DAwr POINT (Fig. 7 a: 1 specimen)

Description: A small, triangular dart point made from a light gray
transluceni flint; the base of this specimen is slightly concave, and
the lateral edges are slightly convex. The left blade edge is alternately
beveled. It is 9.3 mm. in length, with a maximum width of 19 ram.
(at the base), and a maximum thickness of 6 ram. The specimen was
recovered from the plow zone above Burial 9.
Discussion: Matamoros and other triangular projectile points are
common on sites of the Brownsville and Barril complexes (MacNeish, 1958: 189). They are also found on sites of the South Texas
Archaic, present in adjoining counties (Weir, 1956: 66).
TBIANGULAII "KNIFE" (Fig. 7 c: 1 specimen)
Description: This crude trianguloid biface was found by the landowner at the site, and the exact provenience is uncertain. It has
convex blade edges, and a straight base (one corner of which is
damaged); it measures 70 ram. long, with a maximum width (near
midsection) of 43 mm., and a maximum thickness of about 8 ram.
Discussion: Specimens of this sort have not previously been reported from Brownsville complex sites, and are not found in the
Brownsville complex collections of A. E. Anderson (Texas Archeological Research Laboratory). However, Anderson did collect from several Archaic sites in the Cameron County area (which he termed
the "Cayo Culture") and a few specimens similar to the one described here were found. Triangular knives are a common feature
in South Texas Archaic sites found in adjacent counties (Weir,
1956: 65).
END-SCRAPER (Fig. 7 d: 1 specimen)
Description: The specimen is a roughly trianguloid biface thinning
flake, with a piano-convex cross section. The distal end is convex,
while the striking platform remains at the proximal end. The distal
end has been slightly retouched, producing a cutting or scraping edge
on the convex face; the flat face is unmodified. The specimen is 39.5
ram. long, with a maximum width of 9,1 ram. and a maximum thickness of 3.5 mm. It was found on the surface.
Discussion: Similar specimens are present in the A. E. Anderson

coast but they are usually smaller than the specimen described here.
GROUND STONE ARTIFACTS
7 e: 1 specimen)
Description: A large tubular bead, fashioned from gray-green
jadeite, was found at the site by the landowner. Burial 1 and Miscellaneous Feature 1 were later removed by heavy machinery from
the area where the jadeite specimen was found. It is 43 ram. long,
with the perforation extending the entire length and averaging 5 ram.
in diameter. The maximum thickness of the specimen is about 15
mm. The maxinmm width of 22 ram. occurs at each end and the minimum width of about 20 ram. occurs at midsection. The specimen is
highly polished.
Discussion: Both jade and jadeite beads occur in the Huasteean area
of Mexico. Ekhohn (1944: Fig. 54) has illustrated a number of jade
beads found with burials at the Las Flores site. Most of these are less
than an inch long, though one is almost one and one-half inches in
length. Ekholm (p. 487) states: "âAll of the 132 jade beads . . . were
found with burials at Las Flores. They usually accompanied a greater
number of shell beads in combination with which they had apparently
formed necklaces. They are made of jade of various colors and
qualities .... "
MacNeish has reported jadeite objects from the Brownsville complex (1947: 7): "Two jadeite objects have also turned up in Brownsville complex sites one, a large spherical bead 1 inch in diameter; the
other, a small celt-like object 1 inch long. These undoubtedly came
from Mexico, and probably from the Huasteea . . . Pavon informs
me that they are seen in the Huasteea sites. This contact, moreover,
does not seem to have been entirely from the Huasteca to the Brownsville people since the finding of Oliva shell beads, the shell disc beads
and discs, and the typical Brownsville variant 1 type of projectile
point in Huasteea sites may indicate the reverse as well."

BONE ARTIFACTS
HUMAN BONE ARTIFACTS (Figs. 8, a-d, w-x: 4 specimens)
Description: Under this heading, four artifacts made from human
bone are described. A number of tubular bone beads, many of which
appear to be fashioned from human bone, are discussed in the following section.
All four specimens occurred with Burial 11 C (bundle burial). One
is a human radius, with the distal and proximal ends missing (Fig. 8,
w-x). It is 153 ram. long, with a maximum diameter of 15 ram. The
distal end shows evidence of having been severed and smoothed,
while the proximal end is broken. There is an asphaltum "plug" in
the distal end of the specimen, and the exterior surface exhibits remnants of red and black pigments. Another radius shaft fragment was
also found. It, too, is fragmentary (95 ram. long); the proximal end
is broken, while the distal end has been severed, and the cancellous
interior reamed out. The two modified radii appear to represent one
individual.
Two severed distal ends of radii were found, as well. Though they
have clearly been cut from the shaft, the cut ends have not been
smoothed. One specimen is the distal end of a right radius; it is 54 ram.
long, with a maxinauna diameter of 33 ram. The other specimen is
from a left radius, and is 53.5 ram. long (estimated), and has a maximum diameter of 32 mm. It is suggested that both specimens are
from the radii of a single individual, and that they are probably the
distal ends of the modified radii described above. Traces of a reddish
pigment are present on the exterior surfaces of both artifacts.
Discussion: Hester (1969a; 1969b) has described in detail numerous
human bone artifacts from the southern Texas coast (Kleberg and
Nueces Counties). Most were fashioned from long bone shafts, and
were generally recovered with burials; the specimens described above
were briefly noted. Isolated specimens were also reported from Zapata
County (near the Rio Grande) and from the northeastern coast of
Tamaulipas, just below Brownsville.
TUBULAR BONE BEADS (Fig. 8, e-v: 301 specimens)
Description: A large quantity of tubular bone beads were recovered
from several burials; these are discussed below by burial.
A total of 9,99 tubular bone beads were associated with the skeletons in Burial 11. Twenty-nine bone beads were found with Burial
11 C. One was quite large (29.5 mm. long, with a maximum diameter
of 21 mm.), and is made from human bone. The interior has been
reamed out, and the walls average about 3 mm. in thickness. Twenty-

three others are made from mammal long bone (some of them may be
of human bone), and most of these bear traces of a blackish substance,
perhaps asphaltmn. Transverse cross-seetions vary from almost round
to ovate, and a number have trianguloid eross sections. None is deeorated, though two have shallow transverse notches near one end,
where initial attempts to sever the bone may have been made. These
9,3 specimens range in length from 7.5 mm. to 19 mm., and in maximum diameter from 8 mm. to 14 mm. One other bone bead from the
burial is made from bird bone; it is 11 ram. long, with a maxinmm
diameter of 6 mm.
Two hundred and sixty-five bone beads were found with Burials
11 B and 11 C (together). Four of these are definitely made from
human bone; the interiors have been reamed out and smoothed.
Length ranges from 24 mm. to 33.5 ram., maximum diameter is from
18.5 mm. to 22 mm., and wall thickness varies from 4.5 mm. to 5.5
mm. Two hundred and fifteen others appear to be sections of mammal
long bones, and a number of them may be of human bone. Cross
sections are often oval, though trianguloid transverse cross sections
are also common. Most are undecorated, but several bear remnants
of black and red pigments. The exterior surfaces are usually wellpolished, although some are now badly eroded. "False starts" (initial
attempts at cutting the bone), in the form of slight transverse notches
near one end, are present on several. Length varies from 10 mm. to
19 ram., while the maxinmm diameter is from 8.5 mm. to 14 ram. and
the wall thickness is from 1.5 ram. to 3.5 mm. (the interiors are often
enlarged and smoothed). Most of these specimens are around 13 mm.
long, with maximum diameter of 11 mm.
One group of 46 bone beads with Burials 11 B-11 C are noticeably
smaller than the remainder. These are probably fashioned from the
long bones of birds or very small mammals. Transverse cross sections
are generally oval; a few are trianguloid. There is a range in length
from 8.5 ram. to 14 ram., in maximum diameter from 4 mm. to 8 mm.,
and in wall thickness from 0.5 mm. to 9. mm. None is decorated.
There were five bone beads found scattered through Burial 11;
two of them may be made of human bone. Two have trianguloid
transverse cross sections, and the others have ovate cross sections.
Length ranges from 10 ram. to 15 mm., and maximum diameter is
from 9.5 ram. to 14 mm.; they are undecorated.
Two bone beads were recovered from Burial 7. One has an elliptical cross section, while the other is triangular. The first specimen is
13.5 mm. long, with a maximum diameter of 11 mm., and the second
is 11.5 ram. long, and 9.5 mm. in maximum diameter.

Discussion: Tubular bone beads have been found associated with
burials in Cameron County (A. E. Anderson Collection, Texas Archeological Heseareh Laboratory) and at the Ayala Site in adjoining
Hidalgo County (Campbell and Frizze!l, 1949: P1. 19.). They are
also occasionally found at other localities along the Texas coast
(Campbell, 1956: 15, 35; 1957: 460; and Hester, 1969a).
PERFORATED CANINE TEETH (Fig. 9, e-f: 18 specimens)
Description: These are canine teeth of the coyote (?) which have
been biconically perforated near the root end. All of the specimens
oecurred with Burial 4, and al! but two were arranged in a circular
pattern (Fig. 4). It is probable that these were components of a necklace. Two of the perforated canines were found in situ within Oliva
sayana shell tinklers, where they apparently functioned as clappers
(Fig. 9 b-e).
Length ranges from 9,7 mm. to 3.5 mm., and maximum width averages around 19 ram.
Discussion: Perforated canine teeth have been noted previously in
the Brownsville complex (Anderson, 1939,: 9,0; A. E. Anderson Collection, Texas Areheologieal Research Laboratory) and have been
found at sites along the central and southern Texas coast (Suhm and
others, 1954: 19.7; Hester, 1969a). At the Ayala Site (initially described
by Campbell and Frizzell, 1949), Frederick Rueeking, Jr. found 12
perforated canines associated with a burial; other artifacts found
with the burial include OIi~a saya~a beads, conch shell disc beads, and
rectangular bone pendants. Data gathered on the other burials at the
site suggests that the interments were made by peoples of the Brownsville complex (Hester and Ruecking, this issue).

SHELL ARTIFACTS
DISC-SHAPED BEADS (Fig. 7 f-g: 2 specimens)
Description: Both of these specimens are rather large, thick, discshaped beads; one is fashioned from conch shell, and the other is made
from a hard, white limestone. The eonch shell specimen has a maximmn diameter of 31 ram. and a maximuna thickness of 7.5 mm. The
biconical perforation is near the center and is about 4 ram. wide. The
other bead (limestone) has a maximum diameter of 9,7 ram. and a
maximum thickness of 8 ram.; the perforation (biconical) is about 8.5
ram. in diameter. Both specimens were found with Burial 10.
Diseussion: Disc-shaped beads (made from con& shell) are found
on both Brownsville and Barril complex sites (MacNeish, 1958: 190).

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Some are also found further up the Texas coast, though they are
generally smaller (Campbell, 1956: 34; Hester, 1969a).
Marginella Apicina SHELL BEADS (Fig. 9 r-w: 18 specimens)
Description: These are tiny univalves (Marginella apicina), the
spires of which have been removed to facilitate stringing. Most of the
specimens are badly fragmented, and two or three bear faint traces
of a reddish pigment.
Sixteen were found with Burials 11 B- 11 C (together), and single,
isolated specimens were found with Burial 11 B and with Burial 11 C.
They range in length from 9.5 ram. to 19. ram., and in maximum diameter from 7 ram. to 9.5 ram.
Discussion: A. E. Anderson found Marginella apicina shell beads
with several burials in Cameron County (Texas Archeologieal I~esear& Laboratory collections). Hester (1969a) has reported a burial
at site 41 KL 45 (in Kleberg County) which was accompanied by 180
Marginella apicina beads, two of which were stained with a reddish
pigment. Cecil Calhoun, who found the site, recovered artifacts attributable to both the Brownsville and tloekport complexes.
Noetia Ponderosa SHELL BEADS (Fig. 9 i-q: 85 specimens)
Description: Most of these small pelecypods (Noetia Ponderosa)
are rather badly eroded; a few bear remnants of a reddish pigment.
Sixty were found with Burials 11 B and 1i C (together). Forty-two
of these bear perforations at the beak (umbo); 16 others are perforated about 2 mm. to 5 mm. behind the umbo, and two have perforations at the umbo as well as single perforations further back on
the shell.
Eight of these shell beads were found with Burial 11 B; six were
found on the right innominate. Five of these were perforated at the
umbo, and the other three were perforated just behind it.
Burial 11 C yielded 17 Noetia ponderosa beads, some of which
were inside the cranium, while others were near the fetus cranium.
Thirteen of these are perforated at the umbo, three were drilled just
behind the umbo, and one has two perforations.
The shell beads from these burials range in length from 9.5 ram.
to 19.5 ram., and in maximum width from i1.5 ram. to 23 ram.
Discussion: Perforated Noetia ponderosa are present in the A. E.
Anderson collection of Brownsville complex artifacts (Texas Areheological tlesearch Laboratory). Hester (1969a) has noted Noetia
ponderosa beads from site 41 KL 13 in Kleberg County, also on the
southern Texas coast.

Oliva Sayan SHELL ARTIFACTS (Fig. 9 a-d: 5 specimens)
Description: All of the specimens are fragmentary, and no measurements were possible. Four of the specimens are tinklers which bear
single perforations near the anterior end of the shell. As already mentioned, within two of the tinklers, perforated canine teeth (which functioned as clappers) are still in place. The fifth specimen is a longitudinal fragment of an Oliva sayana shell; it, too, may have been a tinkler.
It was found in place with Burial 4; a perforated canine lay on part
of the fragment. However, it is believed that this is an accidental association, since this particular canine was one of several forming a
circular pattern around the upper part of the burial.
All of the specimens were found with Burial 4.
Discussion: Oliva shell tinklers are common in the Brownsville
complex (Anderson, 1932: P1. 7; MacNeish, 1958: 191). In nearby
Hidalgo County, Oliva sayana tinklers were found associated with a
burial at the Ayala Site (Hester and tluecking, this issue).
MISCELLANEOUS tlEFUSE
During the course of the work at the site, several forms of nonartifactual debris, as well as some historic Anglo-American artifacts,
were recovered from the surface. The non-artifactual debris includes
scattered snail shells, a few mussel shell fragments, several burned
clay lumps, two small sharkâs teeth, and the tooth of a peccary. The
peccary has ranged into the area in only very recent times (Ernest
Lundelius, personal communication). The recent historic artifacts
include glass and crockery fragments.

SUMMARY
Salvage excavations were carried out at the Floyd Morris Site
(41 CF 9.) in Cameron County in June, 1966. The investigations at
the site, conducted by students from the Department of Anthropology,
The University of Texas at Austin, revealed a number of burials and
miscellaneous features (most of which had been damaged by landleveling processes). Several of the burials were accompanied by grave
goods, including tubular bone beads, shell beads, shell tinklers, perforated canine teeth, disc-shaped beads, and modified human bones;
also, the bones in a bundle burial exhibited coatings of black and red
pigments. Most of these artifacts are attributable to what has been
termed the Brownsville complex (MacNeish, 1958: 191). Several
artifacts (none of which was in place) were found that may represent
earlier, Archaic activities at the site. Of particular interest was the
recovery of a tubular jadeite bead, which may be intrusive from the
Huasteean area of Mexico.

Apparently, the high elevation (35 feet above sea level) on which
the site is located, was favored for burials at different periods in time.
Burial was probably intermittent, since the internIents differ from
one another in skeletal orientation and position, and sinee various
degrees of bone mineralization are present. Although less clear, the
presence of various artifact forms seems eonsistent with this proposal.
Additional evidence for intermittent burial is the non-patterned
arrangement of the burials; i.e., they are apparently scattered randomly over the elevation, and are not gaâouped in a particular area.
This site is the second cemetery site to be reported for the lower
Rio Grande valley (the Ayala eemetery was reported by Campbel!
and Frizzell, 1949). Though the burial goods at these two sites are
suggestive of Brownsville affliation, MaeNeish (1947, 1958) has not
mentioned the use of eemetery areas by this culture. While the
investigators noted some indistinct patches of midden debris at the
site, no concentrated occupational area was located. Evidently, if local
groups responsible for the burials resided nearby, their burial and
habitation areas were separate; or, if the burials were associated with
migratory groups, the groups apparently occasionally took advantage
of the elevation for interment but did not reside at the site for any
length of time.
By the time the University of Texas crew arrived at the Floyd
Morris site, much of it had been disturbed. Only 18 burials (and disturbed burials) were recorded, but widely separated occurrences of
human bone on the surface indicated the presence of many more
skeletons, leading the senior author to believe that perhaps as many as
7,5 to 100 burials were once present in the site area. Many of these had
been nearly totally destroyed, and lack of time did not permit investigation of other known burials. Also, the land owner reported that in a
previous leveling of this same field, a few human bones had been

removed.
Two cemeteries have thus far been reported in this region, Floyd
Morris and Ayala. As we have already stated, the Floyd Morris site
was badly disturbed, and lack of time and funds prevented more
extensive salvage operations. The other cemetery, Ayala, was investigated twice (Campbell and Frizzell, 1949; Hester and Iluecking, this
volume), but unfortunate eiremnstances prevented extensive, careful
work. It is evident, therefore, that other cemetery sites in the area
need to be located and systematieally excavated. Only then will it be
possible to determine the eultural affiliations and temporal positions
of the peoples responsible for these sites.

INTRODUCTION
In 1949, T. N. Campbell and J. Q. Frizzell reported a number of
burials and associated artifacts from the Ayala Site (University of
Texas designation: 41 HG 1) near MeAllen in Hidalgo County, Texas
(Fig. 1). They described 11 burials (containing 15 individuals) from
the site, noting that most of the skeletons appeared to have been in
a flexed position, though good orientation data were lacking. Numerous artifacts were associated with the burials, including Oliva sayar~a
shell beads, disc-shaped beads made from conch shell and tubular
bone beads, some of which had encircling grooves. The association of
these artifacts with the burials suggested that the interments were
made by peoples of the Brownsville culture (MacNeish, 1947: 6) during the Neo-American period. However, the burials had intruded into
a thick midden which apparently represented earlier, Archaic occupations. Gouges, a triangular knife, a trianguloid dal~ point, and other
Archaic-style materials were found in the midden debris surrounding
the burial pits.
In June and December of 1952, Frederick Ruecking, Jr., then a
student at The University of Texas, returned to the Ayala Site to
obtain additional data. He conducted limited excavations at the site,
and the artifacts and field notes resulting from this work are stored at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at Austin. The purpose
of this brief paper is to present the data obtained by Ruecking in 1959..
Then, by utilizing the information provided by Campbell and Frizzell
(1949), the archeology of the Ayala Site is summarized.
THE SITE
The Ayala Site has previously been described by Campbell and
Frizzell and a portion of their description is presented here: "The
Ayala site has a distinctive physiographic location. It lies on high
ground which rises about 15 feet above a former channel of the Rio
Crande (the Sardinas Resaca, Fig. 1 ). This old channel has a width of
approximately 2,500 feet at the Ayala locality, and it is now used as
a floodway. According to Mr. Ayala, the records show that the Rio
Crande occupied this channel in the latter part of the eighteenth

century, when the area was first settled by Europeans. Today the
Rio Grande is six miles south of the Ayala site. The site is now
sparsely covered by large mesquite trees, and there is no record of its
ever having been under cultivation." Rueckingâs maps of the site area
show that a number of farm buildings and other structures occupy
much of the site area. The main concentration of burials seems to be
on the Ayala property, though Mr. Ayala told Ruecking that a few
burials had been found on the property just north of his.

BURIALS AND ASSOCIATED ARTIFACTS
Burials were first discovered at the site in July of 1945, when a
sewer trench was dug by the Ayalas. These burials were subsequently
investigated by Jack Frizzell. In 1952, Ruecking returned to the site
for further excavations. A grid was established, and several units
were opened. However, Rueckingâs endeavors were seriously hampered by workmen employed by the landowner. They were digging
haphazardly in the hope of finding a "treasure cave" which was believed to exist on the property and Ruecking spent much of his time

PREHISTORIC CEMETERY SITES

trying to document many of the discoveries made by the untrained
laborers.
In discussing the burials recorded by Ituecking, it should be pointed
out that it is difficult to determine the exact number of burials excavated, either by llueeking or by the untrained workmen. Itueekingâs
specimen catalog lists five burials (Burials 1, 2, g, 4, and 6), yet a
sketch of a "Burial 7" also appears in the notes. Complieating the situation further are plans of the Ayala Site on whieh the locations of 44
burials are indicated (Fig. 1). Apparently, Itueeking was unable to
correlate the burial data obtained by Campbell and Frizzell with his
own. Furthermore, no horizontal plan of burials appears in the 1949
report by Campbell and Frizzell, so again we cannot tell if some of the
burials noted by Ituecking duplicate those recorded in 1949.
Itueckingâs Burial 1 (an adult) was discovered by untrained workmen and was badly disturbed before it was recorded. It was located
about five feet below the surface (see Fig. 1). A number of artifacts
were associated. An antler beam fragment (Fig. 4, c), 230 ram. long
and with a maxinmm diameter of 27 mm., was present though it
exhibits no apparent modification. A large trianguloid pendant was
also found (Fig. 4 a-b). It is fashioned from conch body whorl, and is
163.5 ram. in length. The proximal end is 108 mm. wide, while the
distal end is 31 ram. in width. Two perforations, about 5 mm. in diameter and spaced 10 mm. apart, are present g ram. from the distal end.
One lateral edge is convex and the other is slightly concave and
recurve& Numerous tiny, closely-spaced notches (averaging 1.5 mm.
in length) are present along both lateral edges, and the proximal
edge. Specimens similar to this have been noted by MaeNeish
(1958: 191).
Two Oliva sayana tinklers (Fig. 2 n-o) were associated with Burial
1. About one-third of the shell (posterior or spire end) has been
removed, and the edges have been smoothed; they range in length
from 49. to 49 ram., and in maximum diameter from 21.5 to 23 ram.
At the anterior end of each specimen, a transverse notch has been cut
and a single perforation made near the center of the notch. On one
specimen, two closely-spaced perforations are present on the body
whorl about 31 mm. from the anterior end. These tinklers are common
in the Brownsville eomp!ex (MacNeish, 1958: 191). A carnivore
eanine (coyote), with a hole at the root end, was also found. It is
38 nnn. long, with a maximum diameter of 9 mm. At the Floyd Morris
Site (41 CF 2) in nearby Cameron County, tinklers have been found
with what are probably Brownsville culture burials; carnivore eanines

Other bone artifacts were also found with Burial 1. These include
22 small tubular bone beads (animal or bird bone), averaging 10
mm. in length, and about 5 ram. in maximum diameter. All are undecorated, though slight cut marks are present on several. A rectangular
bone object (possibly a pendant) was also recovered. It is 69, mm.
long, with a maximum width Of 23 mm. and a maximum thickness of
1.5 mm. There is a small bieonical perforation at one corner and one
face is decorated with incised lines (see Fig. 3 x). These incised
lines contain remnants of a black pigment, which under microscopic
examination appears to be asphaltum. A "ladder" motif, composed of
two parallel incised lines crossed transversely by short incised lines,
is the basic part of the design. Using this ladder motif, two rectanguloid figures (with one long side missing from both) have been executed. One of these figures has been placed with the other (see Fig.
3 x). This design element (one rectangle with an open side fitting
within an identical, but larger rectangle) occupies approximately twothirds of one face. Just above it is another incised line design, much
more poorly executed, and part of which seems to be missing since
the specimen is broken at that end. This design is box-like (almost
square) with the ladder motif employed on three sides. Within this
is a similar parallel-line design, though the short transverse notches
are missing. While not apparent to the naked eye, microscopic examination revealed faint traces of asphaltum within the incisions. We
would like to point out that a search of the literature failed to yield
other specimens from the Texas coast exhibiting asphaltum placed
in incised designs. However, Cecil Calhoun (1967, personal communication) has recently found an antler tine fragment at 41 NU 11
(Nueces County) which bears an incised zig-zag line filled with
asphaltum.
A trianguloid dart point (Fig. 3 a) was found at the same level as
the burial (No. 1), though it seems to have been associated with the
Archaic midden surrounding the interment. It is crudely made from a
gray flint and has a concave basal edge and concave lateral edges. It
measures 34 ram. in length, has a basal width of 9,7 mm. and a maximum thickness of 6.6 ram. Another projectile point was noted by
1queeking as having been found at the same location, but it is not now
available for study.
Burial 9. was found just south of Burial 1 at a depth of about 5 feet.
It, too, was removed by untrained workmen, and no other data are
available. No artifacts seem to have been associated with it.
Burial 3 was excavated carefully by lqueeking. It was located just
west of Burial 1 about 40 to 49 inches below the surface. Though the

skeleton (that of an adult) was fragmentary, it seems to have been
flexed, and oriented east-west, with the head to the west. Seventy-six
tubular animal bone beads (Fig. 3 b-g) were associated with the
burial; they average 10 ram. in length, and 5 mm. in maximum diameter, with the bone wall about .5 ram. thick. Slight cut marks are
present on several of them, while on one specimen there are two
encircling grooves (see Campbell and Frizzell, !949: Plate 12, I). Five
disc-shaped beads (probably of conch shell) were also found with the
burial. They vary in diameter from 9 mm. to 11 mm. and in maxinmm
thickness from 2 mm. to 4 mm. (Fig. 2 a-l). At a depth of 59 inches,
well below the burial, and within the Archaic midden, a projectile
point (evidently a triangular dart point) was recovered, but is not
available for study.
Burial 4 was located just north of Burial 1 at a depth of about 5
feet below the surface. Apparently, the skeletal material was not
articulated, but the burial may have been disturbed since it was
uncovered by the untrained laborers.
Burial 5 is also quite perplexing. Skeletal fragments of an adult and
a juvenile are present but no sketch map or other documentation
exist for the burial, and therefore the relationship of the two individuals within the grave is unknown. The burial is said to have been
found about 5 feet below the surface, circa 75 feet southwest of
Burial 1. It is possible that this burial (like several others at the site)
was uncovered by the laborers workin~ for the landowner; it may
have been so badly disturbed that Ilueeking was unable to accurately
record it.
A number of artifacts were apparently associated with Burial 5.
Seven Oliva sayana shell beads (with the spire tips removed) were
found (Fig. 9. m, p-u). They range in length from 37 ram. to 50 mm.,
and in maximum width from 16 mm. to 9.7 mm. Also found were 19.
carnivore canines (coyote), all of which had been perforated at the
root end (Fig. 3 h-s). Six disc-shaped shell beads (conch) ranging
from 10 ram. to 18 mm. in maximum diameter and from 2 ram. to 3.5
ram. in maximum thickness, were also associated (Fig. 9. a-l). Four
reetanguloid bone pendants were among the grave goods with Burial
5. Three of the specimens (Fig. 3 t-v) are nicely shaped and polished,
but are undecorated. They range in length from 9.3 mm. to 45 mm.,
in maximum width from 9 ram. to 15 ram., and in maximum thickness
from 1.5 ram. to 9..0 ram. The fourth bone pendant (Fig. 3 w) bears
two incised "X"-shaped designs on one-half of one face, while two
parallel meandering incised lines extend the entire length of the oppo-

site half of the face. This specimen is 42 mm. long, 13 ram. at maximum width, and is 2.5 mm. thick.
Burial 6 was found about 25 feet northeast of Burial 1 at a depth of
about 39, inches below the surface. Adult cranial and p0stcranial
materials are present, but the orientation of the skeleton(s) is unknown. A sketch does exist for Burial 7, which was excavated by
Ruecking. It was found about 125 feet east of Burial 1, in a garden.
It, too, seems to have been !ocated about 32 inches below the surface.
According to Rueekingâs notes, no grave goods were found; a grave
pit could not be delineated. Near the burial, though probably not
associated with it, a mostly complete turtle shell was found. While it
seems most probable that the turtle remains represent food refuse in
the midden, it should be noted that Campbell has recorded a turtle
shell rattle found with a burial at the Caplen Site on the northern
coast of Texas (1957: 461).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
During 1952, Frederick Ruecking, Jr., carried out limited investigations at the Ayala Site in Hidalgo County, Texas. Several burials
were excavated and/or recorded by Ruecking. His plan of the site and
its environs (Fig. 1) shows the location of 44 burials, but descriptive
data concerning most of these are lacking. Burial goods accompanying
the skeletons included: Oliva sayana beads and tniklers, tubular bone
beads, disc-shaped conch shell beads, a large triangular conch whorl
pendant, a large antler beam fragment, incised bone pendants and
perforated carnivore canines. Combining these and other data with
the information recorded by Campbell and Frizze!l (1949), the following table has been prepared to summarize the burial traits manifested at the Ayala Site:
Two reports have now been contributed concerning the archeology
of the Ayala Site, but even more work should be done at this important site. Though laborers employed by the landowner damaged
much of the site, a good deal of it is apparently stil! intact, and careful, methodical work is desperately needed at the site.
Most of the burial goods listed in Table 1 are common in the
Brownsville culture (MaeNeish, 1958: 190-199,; A. E. Anderson Collection, Texas Areheological Research Laboratory), but such items as
rectangular bone pendants (especially with incised decorations) and
the association of red ochre with burials are heretofore unrecognized
traits.
The burial goods at the Ayala Site are clearly suggestive of Brownsville affiliation. However, we still do not know the exact temporal

range of some of the shell and bone artifacts charactelistic of that
culture. It is conceivable (and probable) that shell and bone artifacts
used in Neo-Ameriean (Brownsville) times in this area could have
also been present during the Archaic. So it is tenuous at best to say
flatly that the Ayala cemetery is entirely attributable to the Brownsville culture. While it is possible that these peoples took advantage of
the high elevation now known as the Ayala Site for interments, it is
also quite possible that the Archaic peoples to whom is attributed
most of the midden at the site (Campbell and Frizzell, 1949) may be
responsible for some of the burials. There is no evidence of any historic aboriginal groups using the site for burial purposes. It is probably accurate to say that several stages of burial activity, occurring
at different periods in time, are represented at the site. Unfortunately,
we have such meager data from the site that we can say little more.
l:tueeking believes that the lower levels of the midden are attributable
to Archaic occupations, based on the small quantities of artifacts
(none now available for study) that he saw from these levels. He
does not recall seeing any artifactual debris in the upper parts of the
midden which would indicate a Brownsvillean occupation. This suggests that if most of the burials are attributable to the Brownsville
complex (as indicated by associated grave goods), then the habitational area is located somewhere away from the cemetery.

A DISCUSSION OF BURIAL PRACTICES

AND THE LOWER TEXAS COAST
THOMAS ROY HESTER

In Parts I and II, burials and associated artifacts fiâom the Floyd
Morris Site and the Ayala Site have been described in detail. Both
sites are large cemeteries; the burial goods are suggestive of the
Brownsville complex (MacNeish, 1947, 1958), but occupational areas
attributable to this complex were not found. The similarities of the
burial goods and other burial traits at the two sites are pointed out
in Table 1.

Corpus Christi area southward. In Kleberg County, the Dietz Site
cemetery has been known for several decades, having first been excavated by Clyde T. Reed in 199,,7 (1937: 9,18-9,9,1). The site is located
near Cayo del Grullo southeast of Kingsville. Reed excavated 9,1
skeletons, one of which was accompanied by two tubular stone pipes.
Also associated with naany of the burials were segments of human
long bone which had been made into tube-like artifacts. E. B. Sayles,
in his archeological survey of Texas, found other human bone artifacts at the site (collections stored at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory). These unusual human bone artifacts have been described in detail (Hester, 1969a; 1969b). No occupational area was
found around the cemetery, though several are in the general vicinity
(Hester, 1969a).
In Nueces County, several cemeteries are known. Site 41 NU 9, (on
Oso Creek) was investigated by The University of Texas in 1939â
(Jackson, 1933); 39 burials containing 93 individuals were excavated
but burial goods, mainly traingular mussel shell pendants and a bone
tube made fiâom a human femur, were rare. Several areas of occupation were noted around the perimeter of the cemetery. Upstream
from 41 NU 9â, William Stanton (personal communication) has located
two additional cemeteries. One of these, 41 NU 29, has yielded over
65 burials; occasional burial goods were found, including a stone
pendant, three large triangular objects made fiâom bison scapula and
decorated with drilled pits, and a multi-perforated bone flageolet-like
object. Across the creek from this site, Stanton and others have found
several burials at site 41 NU 37. The cemetery area is almost totally
devoid of occupational refuse, though a large campsite is adjacent
to it on the north.
In San Patricio County, Jack Hughes (1951) excavated a cemetery
site near Odem. Prior to his work, nearly 50 burials had been removed
from the site. He found at least 10 poorly-preserved skeletons, but
again burial goods were rare. Associated with one of the burials was
a corner-notched arrow point with a finely-serrated blade; the landowner found two Scallorn arrow points and a small side-notched dart
point with burials he unearthed at the site. There was no midden
debris in the cemetery area, but a large campsite is located a few
hundred yards to the north.
With this brief examination of cemetery sites on the lower coast,
it is quite evident that the Floyd Morris and Ayala Sites have very
little in common with them. While bone beads of human bone were

found at Floyd Morris, they bear little resemblance to the hmnan
bone tubes found at the Dietz Site; but, the fact that this unusual
trait is present at both sites may be significant.
BURIAL PRACTICES IN THE INTERIOR OF SOUTHERN TEXAS
A number of burials have been excavated in the interior of southern
Texas, but in most reported eases these have been single interments
without associated artifacts (Cason, 1959.: 239; Davis, 1961: 5; Hester,
1964a: 2; 1964b: 1, 2; Nunley and Hester, 1966: 244; Mardith Schuetz,
personal communication). The burial reported by Cason (1952: 9,39,
240) was found at the Castillo Site in Zapata County, and was accompanied by numerous tubular bone beads, and a bone tube fashioned
from a human ulna. A cremation has been briefly noted by Hester
(1964a: 2) from the Minus Site in Dimmit County; a disc-shaped
stone bead and fragments of an engraved mussel shell were associated.
In mid-western Coahuila, Avelyra Arroyo de Anda and others
(1956) have reported the site of Cueva de la Candelaria, a shaft cave
in which numerous burials have been placed. The burials were accompanied by a variety of flint, bone, antler, shell and wooden artifacts.
Artifact forms shared by Cueva de la Candelaria with the Floyd
Morris and Ayala Sites include: (1) Oliva sayana tinklers (2) a triangular conch whorl pendant (3) numerous tubular bone beads (4)
Marginella apicina shell beads; and, (5) disc-shaped conch shell
beads. Many of the disc-shaped conch shell and Marginella apicina
"beads" were bound together with cordage into rattle-like objects.
We have seen that in southern Texas, large cemetery sites are
located along or relatively near the coastline, while inland, single
random burials are generally found. An exception to this is the shaft
cave of Cueva de la Candelaria, where the roving bands in midwest
Coahuila seem to have returned fiâequently to dispose of their dead.
The presence of Brownsville-like artifacts at this site would seem to
indicate some trade contact between the Brownsville peoples and the
groups in midwest Coahuila, perhaps through intermediary groups.
It has been previously suggested (MacNeish, 1958: 190), based on
data supplied mainly by Sayles (1935: Table 5) and Ekholm (1944:
Fig. 52), that the peoples of the Brownsville complex traded their
abundant shell artifacts rather widely.
BURIAL PRACTICES IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY
Earlier reports have only briefly mentioned the burial practices
in the Cameron and Hidalgo Counties area. In 1933, A. E. Anderson
of Brownsville prepared a brief manuscript (unpublished: on file at

160

TEXAS ARCIIEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

the Texas Archeological Ilesearch Laboratory) on the burial customs
of the Rio Grande delta. He prefaced his report by indicating that
his data were unsatisfactory, due to his "neglect in making intelligent
observations . . . and in part to the usually scattered and fragmentary
nature of the burials." Anderson distinguished two types of burials,
which he termed "bone burials" (secondary or bundle burials) and
"body burials" (primary inhumations). In the "bone burials" only the
skull, mandible, long bones (and sometimes the pelvis) were interred.
The arrangement of the bones varied; in some instances, the skull was
placed on top of the other bones, while other times, the skull was set
on the bottom of the grave pit, and the long bones were placed
vertically around it.
His "body burials" were often found lying on the back extended
full length, or flexed on the side. Anderson also states (p. 2) that
"group burial, of two or three individuals in one grave, is not uncommoll."

Two cremations were also noted by Anderson. In each instance, the
postcranial skeleton was thoroughly charred, but the skull was not.
As for the placement of the burials, Anderson observed that "lone
burials seem to have been the custom, or at least they predominate
. . . the point of a hill commanding a good view seems to have been
desirable" (p. 3). Banks of old river channels (resacas) were also
favored burial areas.
Anderson found only one possible cemetery during his long collecting activities. This was located on the banks of a horseshoe-shaped
resaea on the Iteparo Banch in Cameron County. Some eight or nine
individuals were buried in an area about 9.5 to 30 feet square. One
incised shell ornament, circular and perforated near the center, was
found.
Only about ten percent of the interments excavated by Anderson
contained burial goods. He describes these only in general terms:
"Shell, stone, and occasionally bone [tempered?] pottery and asphalt
are the lasting materials encountered in the graves. Ornaments are
more likely to be found in a childâs grave than in an adultâs."
Though not mentioned in his manuscript, Anderson did uncover
a burial exposed by ditch-digging on 14th Street in Brownsville (Texas
Archeological tlesearch Laboratory collections). The burial, which
seems to have been that of a child, was accompanied by numerous
Marginella apicina shell beads. Briefly, other burials of note that were
found by Anderson in the area include: (1) a burial on the Fresnos
Itesaca in Cameron County which contained a perforated shell ornament with a human face (?) carved on it in low relief; and (90 a

burial containing two individuals (a female and a juvenile) in which
the skeletons were flexed on the left side, with the skulls directed to
the south, and the hands placed on front of the faces.
In 1935, J. Alden Mason reported burials excavated by Anderson
which contained intrusive Huasteean-like pottery. Also in 1935, a
local newspaper (the Harlingen Valley Morning Star) reported that
a number of skeletons were uncovered by road construction near the
Hidalgo and Cameron Counties boundary, north of the Arroyo Colorado. The article states "Bones, many of which are in a semi-petrified
state, are being unearthed by a big plow pulled by a tractor. Plowing
thus far has covered about half an acre. Groups of bones are scattered over this area. One fairly complete skeleton has been uncovered, and a large number of stray bones, including several skulls and
other separate bones. The burial ground is located on a large knoll,
and graves are about one to two feet deep."
In 1956, a local school teacher, Dick Harris, investigated a cemetery
near l~io Hondo uncovered by land-leveling operations. Unfortunately,
we know very little about the site, but Harris was able to salvage several burials (letter to T. N. Campbell, August 8, 1956). Assoeiated
with these burials (see Fig. 1) were conch shell disc-shaped beads,
perforated canine teeth, and one or two shell gorgers. The landowner
excavated one burial and found a triangular projectile point associated
with it. A stemmed obsidian dart point was collected from the surface
of the site. Harris estimated that 20 to 40 burials were present at the
site. From these indieations, the site seems quite similar to Floyd
Morris and Ayala.
While we have this data on burial practices in the Rio Crande delta
area, there is little evidenee with any of the burials to firmly link

162

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

them to any defined cultural unit; some, like the burials reported
by Mason (1935: 38), a couple mentioned by Anderson and the Rio
Hondo cemetery, may be attributable to the Brownsville complex,
but this has not been convincingly demonstrated. MacNeish (1947,
1958) has described and defined the Brownsville complex, which is
characterized by the extensive use of marine shell in the production
of tools and ornaments. Though MacNeish believes the complex to
be primarily Neo-American (and extending into the historic era) in
age, his assmnptions are based exclusively on surface collections. In
his 1958 paper, MacNeish has summarized his impressions of the
Brownsville complex (and the neighboring Barril complex) burial
customs: "Burials of these complexes are usually flexed and in shallow
pits near or in campsites. For the most part they are without grave
goods. However, several have with them a few beads or pendants,
and a number have whole Huastec pots . . 7 (p. 199.).
This very generalized summary by MaeNeish, as well as the sketchy
data compiled by Anderson and others, does not help us very much
in trying to fit the Floyd Morris and Ayala cemeteries into the local
archeologieal picture. Similarly, the data on the burial customs of the
historic Coahuiltecan groups in the area is also very unsatisfactory.
ttuecking (1955: 139) cites Leon, who stated that the dead were
buried away from the village, and that cremation was sometimes
practiced.
Prior to the reporting of the Floyd Morris and Ayala Sites, this
previous research in the Rio Crande delta provided the following
burial characteristics which were later to be recognized at Floyd
Morris and Ayala: (1) flexed burials; (2) multiple burials; (3) primary and secondary burials; (4) associated shell artifacts; (5) location of burials on high elevations and along resaca banks; (6) placement of some burials away from campsite areas; and (7) presence of
other cemeteries.
That the Floyd Morris and Ayala Sites do not conform neatly to
the previously reported burial patterns in the area should not be surprising. There has never been any extensive excavation program
carried out at sites in the delta region; most of what is known about
the area is based on the large surface collections of A. E. Anderson.
He (unpublished notes) has said that the only times he found burials
was when they were eroding out (or were completely exposed), or
when ditch-digging operations had uncovered them. Since he apparently rarely excavated the area around the eroded burials, he may
have missed many additional burials.
Although we can suggest that the Floyd Morris and Ayala Sites

PREHISTORIC

CEMETERY

SITES

163

are attributable to the Brownsville complex because of the associated
burial goods, this conjecture has to be tentative because of the apparent complexity of burial patterns within this complex and in the
whole south Texas region.

HYPOTHESES
It is known that the historic groups in the Rio Grande delta area and
in all of southern Texas were affiliated with the Coahuiltecan linguistic
stock (Newcomb, 1961; T. N. Campbell, personal communication);
and, from the available data, all of the many groups appear to have
shared a simple, nomadic, hunting and gathering Archaic lifeway. It
has also been assumed that the ancestors of the Coahuiltecans probably
inhabited the same area in prehistoric times, practicing a very similar
forni of subsistence (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks, 1954: 138). It has already been noted in this paper that cemetery sites are concentrated on
or near the coast, while in the interior, single burials are found. If the
coastal and interior groups were ancestral to the Coahuiltecans (as
our historic evidence indicates) then what accounts for the difference
in burial customs in the two regions? Three hypotheses are suggested:
1, The readily available and more dependable resources of the
Gulf of Mexico made it possible for groups living along or near the
coast to range over a much smaller area to obtain their subsistence.
Their inland relatives had to be continually on the move in search of
food in semi-arid southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. Perhaps
the coastal groups, traveling only within a small area, repeatedly
buried their dead at one or more conveniently located cemeteries.
The interior groups, always ranging over large areas, disposed of their
dead at random, without elaborate burial goods.
2. Southern Texas groups near the coast lived in one place during
certain parts of the year (perhaps foraging inland during the rest of
the year), taking advantage of marine and/or riverine resources. These
cemeteries then might represent the burials of people who died during
these seasonal encampments.
3. It is possible that the varying burial patterns reflect differing
religious, social or governmental modes among individual groups,
though their subsistence patterns were quite similar. Our historic
data on the Coahuilteeans is meager, though tlueeking (1955) has
cited one example of differing governmental traditions among them.
He notes that Escandon found "incipient tribal or eonfederational organization" present among the Coahuilteean bands in the Rio Grande
delta around 1750 (p. 42), while most other Coahuiltecan groups in
other areas purportedly were very loose-knit governmentally. Per-

haps the incipient confederational organization would be reflected
in more uniform burial customs among the groups, but this is impossible to ascertain with our present data.
However, these hypotheses are constructed on the assumption that
cemeteries are the modal form of burial along the coast and in the
llio Grande delta, but the data of Anderson and others has shown
that other types are present. A systematic study of burial practices is
needed on the coast, and the careful excavation and recording of
future burials is essential. Continued land-leveling and other forms

of progress wilt undoubtedly uncover other cemeteries in the future;
persons engaged in salvage efforts at these sites should obtain a
nIaximum amount of documentation, and where feasible, attempt
to locate adjaeent oeeupation areas. Furthermore, the eemeteries
present on the eentral and upper eoast should be carefully analyzed;
perhaps the key to our understanding of the Rio Grande delta cemeteries can be found there.

Technological Analysis by

JOEL

L. SHINER

ABSTRACT
Artifacts recovered from a deeply stratified midden in Central Texas are
analyzed both typologically and technologically. Certain traditional mythology regarding typology is questioned.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The excavation of the site could not have been possible without
the kind cooperation of the land owner, Mr. Gordon McCann. His
interest in the excavation was an inspiration and Mrs. McCannâs hot
coffee during the winter months was an added incentive.
Many hours of hard labor, digging and shoveling, were shared by
the authorâs companion, Mr. Richard Pruitt.
Valuable infornaation on the classification of artifacts was furnished
by Robert Forrester of Fort Worth. Mr. R. K. "King" Harris also
helped in the identification of several projectile points, as did Mr.
Jay Blaine on the "Paleo" points.
Mr. Roy Padgett of Fort Worth kindly furnished information on
several tool types and on organizing this report.
Dura Maye Briseo was most helpful in converting the field notes
of two years excavation into publishable form.
Mr. Hubert Achor of Dallas is responsible for the photography of
the artifacts. His method is especially designed to emphasize techniques of manufacture and to play down ephemeral accents of natural
coloration.
GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
In Lampasas County, twenty miles from the Colorado River and
twelve miles from the Lampasas River, runs a broken line of hills
and mesas. On the eastern side of these hills a valley gently edges up
to the largest mesa and probes a finger up the eastern side in the
form of a deep and wide gorge. The gorge rises to 1500 feet above sea
level and terminates at a point 20 feet below the top of the mesa. Here
a rapidly flowing spring emerges and flows down the ravine. Materials that form the basis of this report were found in midden trash
and adjacent to the spring.
The topography of the area is typical of the hill country in central
Texas. The valleys have a rich tan loam, which, when cultivated,
grows bluestem, buffalo and witch grass. Along the rivers, hardwoods

168

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

such as pecan and walnut grow. The hills are limestone and where
soil permits, mesquite, live oak, juniper, and elm thrive. Shin oak
grows in profusion on the thin soil. Opuntias, known more commonly
as "prickly pear", grow well and are plentiful in the area. The average
annual rainfall is 30.24 inches. The average January temperature is 47
degrees and that of July is 87 degrees (Texas Almanac, 1955:577).
The site areas are located on top of a mesa that has a measured
elevation of 1580 feet above sea level. Below the crest, between 1540
and 1560 feet, are several acres of fairly level land that surround the
gorge on both sides. There are 5 different sites, each with a large
fire pit, scattered about the area. The mesa is limestone with a very
thin layer of sot! ranging from 9. to 4 inchs. Outeroppings of limestone ridges make walking an easy means of getting about, but by
automobile, following a crude trail 4 miles up the side of the mesa,
a hazard.
None of the mesa top sites are worthy of excavation due to the
thinness of the soil. Other than an occasional surface find tools are
scarce. Camp rubble such as broken manos, cores, chips and flakes
by the thousands cover the area. The sites were not well known due
to the inaccessibility of the mesa. The owner, however, has surface
hunted the area for years.
The native flint at the sites is characteristic of that of the Belton
and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoirs (Bell County) and that of a site
on the Colorado River in Mills County. Basically slate gray, it is
flecked with white and varies in shades from light gray to black.
Intrusive flints are very plentiful here. One of the most common is
the light tan and beige flint found along the Brazos River farther
north. Also very common is the chocolate brown flint common along
the Llano River. Very fine grained white, red, and black flints are the
majority of the intrusive flints. Chert, quartz, and worked obsidian
are also found.
Of the five sites checked, all have burned rock middens. The
heaviest concentration of camp rubble was found around these
burned rock areas (Fig. 1).
Site A has the largest pile of burned rock. Some 400 feet to the
southwest is site D which also has a large area of burned rock. Both
sites are 20 to 30 feet in diameter and 3 to 5 feet high. Test pits in
both areas discovered almost no artifacts. No burials were encountered during any of the excavations or tests in the area.
The McCann site is approximately 125 feet long (east to west) and
40 feet wide. Its shape is determined by the constrictions of the
stream bed and the bluff. These natural boundaries created a situa-

tion like that of a rockshelter where later residents were forced to
camp on top of earlier debris.
Today the vicinity supports a varied flora which would provide a
considerable portion of the subsistence. Among the wild plants that
might have been available in the past are the pecan, walnut, bull
nettle, oak (acorns), hickory, grape, dewberry, plum, persimmon,

clover, prickly pear, dandelion, nut grass, peppergrass, sunflower,
onion and yucca.
An exhaustive assessment of the fauna present in the area today
has not been made, but Blair (1950:93-117) is more than adequate
for study purposes.
Preliminary analysis of the bone from the midden indicates deer and
bison from all levels, but more abundant in Zones I and II.
EXCAVATIONS
It has already been mentioned that the burned rock middens on
the mesa top were not worth excavating because of the erosion and
because of the lack of artifacts. Much of the topsoil and possibly some
of the artifacts came over the cliff and were deposited on the McCann
site. Initially, it was believed that the erosion and redeposition would
create a situation which would include some reverse stratigraphy.
The artifact analysis, however, does not appear to bear this out.
The excavation was planned to cope with both vertical and horizontal differentation. Horizontal controls were maintained by a grid
system of five foot squares. Initially, vertical controls were imposed
as arbitrary six inch levels. Ahnost immediately however, natural
stratigraphy was encountered, and the arbitral7 levels were altered so
as to subdivide the natural zones (Fig. 2).
Zone I had a mean thickness of 18 inches and was excavated in three
levels, beginning at the surface of the site. The matrix was black topsoil with considerable ash. It was tightly packed and contained almost
no burned rock.
Zone II had a mean thickness of 30 inches and was subdivided
into six arbitrary levels. The matrix consisted of large amounts of
gray to white ash and a great accumulation of burned fragments of
limestone. The rocks showed no consistent structure and no clear
patterns were evident.
Zone III was approximately 18 inches thick and its horizontal
dimensions were much smaller. It was 70 feet long and 95 feet maximum in width. The soil was dark brown in contrast to the yellow clay
subsoil, and it showed little evidence of the ash and burned rock
encountered in Zone II.
CLASSIFICATION OF AtlTIFACTS
Projectile point classification was guided by the "Handbook of Texas
Archeology" (Suhm, Kreiger and Jelks, 1954), and by "Excavations
at Stillhouse Hollow" (Sorrow, Sharer and tloss, 1967). Some difficulties were encountered in the matter of the range of the various dfinen-

sions of the points, and the author (Preston) accepts all responsibility
for the classification.
Other tools are classified (Shiner), as nearly as possible, into categories that reflect morphology and technique of manufacture. This
"system" recognizes that hmction can rarely be ascertained at "this
stage in American Archaeology, but shape and process can be described. This avoids the obvious trap of reading use into type names.
Scrapers are classified according to a modified European system
which identifies the position of the working edge relative to the bulb
of percussion.
THE ARTIFACTS

types recovered with each level. Frequencies have been omitted
from the table because there is considerable doubt as to the validity
of many of the types and more doubt as to the ability of any two
individuals to agree on the classification of a significant number of
the points.
Not shown in the list of projectile points are 30 specimens usually
referred to as arrow points because of their small size. All were found
on the surface of the site. They include 15 Scallorn, 3 Young, 1 Alba,
1 Fresno, 1 Perdis, 2 unclassified and 7 fragmentary specimens. There
is no further information on this material, and no grounds for speculation on its relationship to the buried artifacts.
Projectile points reeovered from Zone I are exceptionally numerous
and are of many types. Of considerable interest is the presence together of significant numbers of points thought to be relatively early
and others thought to be characteristic of late Archaic. Ensor, Darl
and Yarbrough points were recovered along side Bulverde and
Pedernales; not just at the same depth, but within each substratum of
the natural zone.
There is some variety to be found in the raw material used, in the
quality of workmanship, in the range of proportions and in gross size.
The Ensor type had many specimens that were of quite superior
workmanship (Fig. 3 d, e). The Ellis type was smaller than would
have been expected. Bulverde and Pedernales types included a number of outsized specimens, many of which are exceptionally well
made (Fig. 3 In, n).
A most unusual phenomenon at the McCann Site is the frequency
of complete projectile points particularly in Zone I. Large numbers
of points are absolutely undamaged down to the smallest details of
tips and barbs. This group includes quite a few types that are long,
thin and slender. At the other extreme, 17 out of the 19 Frio specimens
had been broken. No explanations can be given for the breakage or
the preservation, for there were no burials and no caches.
Zone II consists of a natural level some 80 inches in depth. It is not
only thicker than Zone I, but it shows more apparent change in the
projectile point styles within the Zone. The types Montell, Mareos,
Frio, Castroville, Wells and Marshall are not present at the lowest
arbitrary division of the level, but become more frequent in the upper
strata (Fig. 3). Bulverde and Pedernales types are particularly frequent all through Zone II. Travis and Nolan points are most numerous
in the lower levels of Zone II as wel! as in the highest arbitrary level
of Zone III.
This is a most impressive array of projectile points. The 651 speci-

Zone III, subdivided into three arbitrary levels, covered a smaller
area and contained fewer projectile points (9.18 specimens). As a
unit, it appears to represent a more or less continuous deposition of
midden materials since there are no obvious subdivisions. There are
no apparent natural lines of stratigraphy, no lenses and no sterile layers within the larger natural zone.
The projectile points usually regarded as "Paleo" (Fig. 4) were
recovered at the same level and frequently directly above points
considered to be "Archaic". Such terms as Plainview-like and Angostura-like were used for some of the points even though half of the
specimens in each group appeared to fall within the morphological
limits of the "types" (Fig. 4 d, g). Two of the Plainview-like points
might well be called golondrina variety (Fig. 4 h, k). The meaning
of the type names and certainly the connotations thereof must differ
because of the context of the Archaic situation. Zone III, then, is
characterized by Bulverde, Travis and Nolan in its upper portion.
Lower in the Zone, and presumably earlier in time, the persistence
of the Pedernales type is noteworthy. The "Paleo" types show lateral
edge grinding, but so do all the Gower and some of the Pedernales
points at this level.
It would appear that certain types are fairly diagnostic for timemarkers as far as the McCann Site is concerned (Table II). Thus,
Darl, and Ensor seem to be late, Montell and Frio somewhat earlier,
and so forth, to Angostura and Plainview as the oldest.
Some significance might be attached to the fact that scrapers in
general increase through time, but end-scrapers show the largest
increment. More significance, however, may be seen in the virtual
absence of all flaked stone in Zone III other than incomplete bifaees
and projectile points. Single specimens of burins, bifaee foliates and
retouched flakes contrast peculiarly with the 9.11 projectile points.
Whatever was going on at the site at various periods, it is clear that
the activities of Zone III times differed greatly from later times.
Zone II and Zone I are represented by essentially the same tool
inventory. Clearly the contrast between the two can be seen in progressive change in tool frequencies.
The scrapers do not show the same characteristic pride of workmanship that is evident in the projectile points. Even so, the forms are
extremely well defined (Fig. 5, scrapers from Zone I; and Fig. 6,
scrapers from Zone II). Of the few specimens that did not "fit",
almost all show some unusual trait such as inverse retouch or placement of the bit at the proximal end. Two additional scrapers, not
listed, had been converted into burins by treating the scraping

edge as a truncation, and striking the burin spall from that surface.
One had been an oblique side scraper and the other a transverse side
scraper (Fig. 7 a, h). Several scrapers are made on local flint rubble,
others utilized flint river cobbles with cortex frequent. No clear preference is indicated. Approximately half of the scrapers had thinned
or truncated bulbs of percussion.
Notches are so infrequent that one doubts the wisdom of referring
to them as spokeshaves. Six specimens out of nearly 9_,400 total tools
are few indeed.
Burins are mostly on fortuitously or deliberately snapped pieces.
One is a single blow burin on a snapped piece and 3 are on truncations. Two of the truncations closely resemble edges of scrapers. Three
specimens show additional retouch along the platform in addition
to the burin blow (Fig. 7).
Gravers are carefully chipped from a single face, and many of them
show multiple bits.
Drills may have been halted since almost all of the examples are
either made on former notched or shouldered projectile points, or are
of the "T-head" shape (Fig. 8 a-d; Fig. 10 f).
Bifaces must be considered the most interesting group of all. Other
than the projectile points, the bifaees create an enigma. The one thing
that they probably are not is knives. Anyone who has worked with
stone is aware of the poor cutting characteristics of a biface. The
exceptionally large group from the McCann Site, that were available
for study, showed three sets of characteristics. One sub-group of 124
had been roughed out by percussion, but because of flaws, poor workmanship, or whatever, had not received further treatment (Fig. 9 e,
h, i). A second sub-group of 244 had been roughed out by percussion
and then thinned by billet flaking (Fig. 9 d, f, g, j). Many of this
stage broke because of (vibration?) shock, or were not finished because of hinged flake "knots" ( Fig. 11 a-d ), or were ruined by overshot
flakes (Fig. 11 e-i). The third group of 66 specimens had been percussion shaped, billet thinned and pressure retouched to complete the
job (Fig. 9 a-e). Thus these three groups of bifaees are not several
types but are stages in the process of manufacture.
There are other bifaees in the collection such as the "corner tangs"
and the "spear" point from Zone I (Fig. 19. a, e, d) as well as the
piano-convex pieces of unknown use (Fig. 12 b, e). There are also the
large stemmed pieces (Fig. 6 e, f, g) which show roughing out of the
notches and shoulders before the specimens were finished. These
three all appear to have broken during the thinning stage of the
process. Some complete bifaees from Zone II are shown in Fig. 9 d,

Zone I (Fig. 15). It and a bone bead are the only certain ornanients
found at the site.
According to what we can see in the stratigraphy of tools (Table
III), other than projectile points, not many dramatic changes take
place. Since there are too few tools in Zone III to discuss, we can
only speak of that unit in terms of projectile points.
Zone II is characterized by a high frequency of retouched flakes,
foliates and side scrapers. Zone I is characterized by higher fiequencies of end-scrapers, drills and notches. Burins, truncations, corner tang "knives", gouges, and gravers are too few in number to be
highly significant, but all of these tools appear to be more characteristic of the upper portions of the site (Zone I and the higher arbitrary
levels of Zone II).
Such trends that can be observed, typologically, seem to be from
side scrapers toward end-scrapers, and toward more kinds of tools.
One important trend is in the reduction of tool size. There is a considerable and regular reduction in mean tool size from the lower
levels to the higher levels. This observation does not include projectile
points. They were left out of the calculations because so many were
broken. Table IV illustrates the change, expressed as the mean length
of all tools in each level, measured along the axis of the original strike.

CONCLUSIONS
A very large sample of tools and other remains were recovered
from a stratified site. Because the trash deposit (and/or living area)
was squeezed between the cliff and the water, the situation resembles
somewhat that of a cave. Stratified materials were inevitable as long
as people insisted on living there.
Fortunately, three natural levels existed in the midden. They contrasted in texture and in soil color as well as in artifact content. Excavation of the site in terms of recovering a sequence of projectile points
presented no problem other than that of long, hard labor and the
resolution to maintain rigid horizontal and vertical controls.
Unfortunately, less attention was paid to the recovery of debris and
debitage. A study of this unglamorous material might have shed
further light on the activities of the inhabitants. Especially, it might
have identified many tools as having been locally made. Also, at the

time of excavation, no rational system was available for the classification of scrapers and some of the other tools. Consequently, quite a
few of these tools could not be fgured into the story. They had been
classified, or rather placed into funny categories, and then discarded
following the examples of available literature on central Texas.

The majority of the usable and significant data comes from the
sequence of projectile points (Table I). There is no escaping the fact
that the relative positions of the points are quite secure. Rodent holes
and all other excuses cannot be used here except to a minimal extent.
If numbers of points were moved up or down subsequent to their
deposition, the clearly demarked zones would not have remained
intact.
Some of the data are as follows: the Stillhouse Hollow point sequence (Sorrow et al., 1967) is confirmed at least in part; Bulverde
and especially Pedernales are established as "resident" types (Fig.
16); Gower or Gower-like points are confirmed as early in the sequence; "Paleo" points did occur along side of types that are considered to be "Archaic."
There is no further evidence on the meaning of projectile point
types. We cannot guess why so many types appeared, apparently
together, in the midden. We are unable to comment on the significance or even the existence of trade in projectile points. Had all of
the debris been available for study, perhaps we would know a bit
more about trade.
Less is known about the "other" tools of flaked stone, and a larger
sample would have been desirable. Nevertheless, a considerable continuity of activity is indicated, whether or not the inhabitants were in
the same ethnic "lineage" (lineage in the loose sense of the word).
No meaningful discussion is possible on the relationship of Zone III
to Zone II. On the other hand, from Zone II to Zone I there are
almost overwhelming similarities. These are in spite of very apparent
changes in point types.
The three stages of bifaees, the more frequent of the scraper types

are relatively consistent. Yet there is change. It can be seen in a shift
from side to end-scrapers, in artifact size and in the diversity of tool
types.
It may be speculated that the MeCann Site was a base camp for
different kinds of activities. Whatever the use of the large bifaees
may have been, one must suspect that the residents might have made
what amounts to a surplus of them; the reasoning being that if 368
of them were not finished, how many might they have completed?
How many could have been sold or traded? Was the making of bifaces
an economic activity at the site?
The presence of bones of large mammals suggests hunting, and
the presence of manos and metates suggests gathering of various
plant products. The discarding of large numbers of apparently servieable projectile points may indicate some supernatural belief. An
often repeated "folktale" in Central Texas has it that the Indians
would discard points that had killed something. Sometimes these tales
are based on authentic aboriginal beliefs.

Paleo-Indian Blades From Western Oklahoma
HALLETT H.

HA~lVIATT

ABSTRACT
Two known Paleo-Indian sites in western Oklahoma have been yielding

prismatic blades from unstratified deposits. It is suggested, on the basis of
stratified parallels, that these blades and others of the same description
belong to the Paleo-Indian period. These artifacts would have been admirably suited for use as butchering tools and would have formed as important
a part of the Paleo-Indian economy as the characteristic projectile points.
It is shown that there are causal relationships between certain characteristics
of the blades, and that a substantial degree of skill and knowledge would
be required for their manufacture.

In the past few years the archaeological evidence has been disclosing, in addition to projectile points, a variety of new tool types which
must have formed an everyday part of the economy of the PaleoIndian period.
Common to all stone using hunters throughout the world is the
need for tools and weapons to kill the prey, butcher the meat and
prepare the skin for clothing. Their tool and weapon types have been
designed to meet these three basic needs. Can one assume that the
types which the Paleo-Indian hunter developed to fulfill these three
needs were any less specialized in shape and function than those of
other stone using hunting cultures? The various kinds of Paleo-Indian
proectile points compare quite favorably in specialization of manufacturing technique and form to the finest of the European Upper Paleolithic. Such points, of course, could only have been used to slay the
hunted animal. But what of the tools developed by the Paleo-Indian
hunter to butcher the meat and cut and prepare the skin? Surely, we
can assume the force of ingenuity in the deve!opment of scrapers and
butchering knives to be equal to that which produced the projectile
points.
The possibility of a solution to the problem of how and with what
the Paleo-Indian hunter butchered his prey was most dramatically
presented by the discovery of a cache of twenty-six prismatic blades
with a number of massive core chopping tools and disc shape choppers
in Caddo County, Oklahoma (Hammatt, American Antiquity: in
press). In an attempt to assign this cache of artifacts to one particular
period of American prehistory, one was struck by the obvious parallels
presented by the discovery of a similar group of blades at the Clovis
Site in New Mexico. These blades were assigned to the Llano culture
both on the evidence of the stratigraphic position of the find in the

194

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICALSO~ETY

Crey Sand (Bed 2) of the gravel pit, as well as on the evidence of
other stratified parallels ( Green 1963:157).
In addition, western OHahoma has yielded new evidence that these
uniformly manufactured blades belong to the Paleo-Indian period.
Two canyons in the same area, which have been known for many
years to contain Paleo-Indian deposits, have yielded prismatic blades
of exactly the same description as those mentioned above. One, Cedar
Creek, on the eastern edge of Washita County, north of the town of
Carnegie, has been yielding Paleo-Indian projectile points of varied
styles for many years and is known to contain late Pleistocene deposits. Seven of the blades illustrated (Fig. 1 a-g) were discovered by
Dan Base of Apache, Oklahoma over a period of many years of collecting in the stream bed and associated gravels. The other, Domebo
Creek, in Caddo County was the scene of a full scale excavation in
1962, of Oklahomaâs first mammoth kill site (Leonhardy 1966). Since
that time, the creek bed has been continuously yielding evidence of
Paleo-Indian occupation in the form of Mammoth bones and projectile points. One blade (Fig. 1, h) was found in the Domebo stream
channel downstream from the excavation site.
It is clear that the manufacture of prismatic blades of such description would be backed by a long tradition of well developed stone
working techniques, every bit as standardized as that required for the
production of the various styles of projectile points.
The preparation of the core is the first and most essential step. The
striking platform would have been made from the top of the core most
probably by the removal of a small horizontal flake perpendicular to
the long axis of the blade to be struck. In order to produce a blade
with parallel sides and uniform thickness, at least one ridge must be
made on the side of the core which will run the full length of the
subsequent blade. The ridge or ridges form the â~backbone" of the
blade and determine the length, width, thickness and shape of the
finished product. In the illustrated examples, there is a definite correlation between the curve of the central ridge or ridges and the curve
of one of the sides of the blades. The lines of the sides follow the
meanderings of the central ridges. This is especially noticeable in
Figure 1 band Figure 1 f.
Without the "backbone" ridge, the force applied to the top of the
core would spread and result in a flake with non-parallel sides, whose
width would be greater than the length. Therefore, the presence of
such a ridge is the most important single characteristic in determining
the difference between a blade and a flake (Crabtree 1968:464).
Obviously, the successful extraction of each successive blade from

the core would leave straight ridges on the side of the core which
would serve as "backbones" for the removal of more blades. However, before the first blades were removed from each core, or, if
through some miscalculation, a later attempt at blade extraction went
aniiss and left eccentric side ridges on the cores, then, new ridges
would have to be carefully shaped by lateral flaking. The resulting
ridge would have a jagged, uneven appearance, very different from
the normal ridges. In spite of the unevenness, if the flaking was done
carefully the resulting blade would still have relatively parallel sides.
Figure 1 b and Figure 1 d are blades with ridges which have been
shaped with lateral flaking on the cores. The bottom segment of the
ridge of another of the blades (Fig. 1 e) has also been shaped by
lateral flaking. It is, of course, important to keep the steepness of the
ridges at a fixed angle along the whole length of the side of the core,
because the width of the blade varies in accordance with the angle
that the two longitudinal planes adjacent to the ridges make with one
another. The larger the angle of these planes, the wider will be the
resulting blade.
The main characteristics of the blades under discussion have been
recorded in table form (Table I). All of the examples have wear on
the edges of varying intensity. It is interesting to note that in the
examples with blunted sides (Fig. 1 a, b, e, f, g), the most noticeable
wear appears on the edge directly opposite the blunting. This would
indicate that the tool was not halted, but rather was used in the hand
with one finger pressed against the blunted portion of one side. Secondary retouch appears on all but one of the artifacts and varies from
light to heavy. The retouch was probably for the purpose of resharpening a dull edge for further use.
Proximal thinning, which is evidenced on all but one of the blades
seems to be a general characteristic of Paleo-Indian blades. After the
extraction of each blade from the core, a slight overhang on the
striking platform would be left by the natural swelling of the bulb
of percussion at the proximal end on the inside of the blade. Such
undercutting of the platform on the core must be removed by flaking
before the next blade is struck. This proximal thinning produces a
series of facets on the top inward face of the subsequent blade.
The bulbar sear is the slight indentation left in the inside of the
proximal end. The proximal lip is the small thin ridge running along
the inside of the segment of the striking platform left on the blade.
These two eharacteristics may bear some relation to the method of
manufacture, but their general significance is not known. There are,

In general then, the manufacture of prismatic blades such as these is
not purely the result of trial and error, but rather of an understanding
of the cause and effect relationships existing between the core, the
side ridges and the finished product. With the comprehension of these
relationships, the shape of the resulting blade can be anticipated with
a reasonable degree of accuracy, producing a form which, in its way,
is evely bit as specialized as the various kinds of Paleo-Indian projectile points.

Denton Creek Watershed
JON L.

GIBSON AND BLAKE L. BENI-IAiVI

ABSTRACT
Archaeological reconnaissance of two small reservoirs within the Denton
Creek watershed of north central Texas recorded three archaeological sites.
The nature of these sites as seen through the limited amount of cultura!
material presents little information concerning the activities represented or
their position within a temporal framework. The environmental data has
been used to pose inferential arguments about prehistoric adaptation and
to evaluate the data beyond mere description. In this sense, various questions have been asked and tentatively answered in the light of hypothetical
situations.

SITES AND ENVIRONMENT: A STUDY OF THE
ARCHAEOLOGY OF A PORTION OF THE DENTON CREEK
WATERSHED, WISE COUNTY, TEXAS
JON L. GIBSON

INTRODUCTION
During a two week period from January 1 to 15, 1968, a portion
of the Denton Creek Watershed was systematically surveyed. The
survey area corresponds to the lower 1,~,,â miles of the Sweetwater Creek
alluvial plain near its confluence with Denton Creek (Fig. 1). This
tract of approximately 1000 acres is in eastern Wise County, about 8
miles east of the small town of Decatur, Texas. It is unequally divided
by State Highway 24 with the greatest portion lying south of the
highway.
The area figures prominently in the Denton Creek Watershed Flood
Prevention Project, as it is slated to become one of two nmltipurpose
structures in the Denton Creek drainage. Upon completion, this
structure, Site 28 (Soil Conservation Service 1965:20), will provide
municipal water for Decatur as well as affording recreational facilities
such as boat docks and ramps, bathing beaches, picnic areas, and
nature trails.

DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENT
The survey area lies within the Grand Prairie Physiographic Province (Fenneman 1931 and 1938). This narrow strip of prairieland
is between the Eastern Cross-Timbers and the Western Cross-Timbers.
l~elief becomes more pronounced near its southern and southwestern

borders as the rugged limestone country of the Edwards and Comanche plateaus is approached. To the north, the Grand Prairie
merges imperceptibly with the grasslands of the High Plains. Generally the Grand Prairie Province is characterized by wide, flat to
rolling plains dissected occasionally by small steepsided stream
valleys. It is with one of the small valleys that this report is coneerned.

A number of microenvironments (microhabitats) are contained
within the survey area. Detailed consideration of each of these small
ecologically significant zones has provided the basis of several of the
hypotheses which follow. In essence, this cultural paleoecological approach intends to offer plausible interpretations oÂ£ the aboriginal
utilization of the natural environment. From this, inferences have
been made regarding the underlying socio-cultural requisites necessary

ment has remained more or less constant since the time of Indian
occupancy to the present; that is to say, that since the prolonged
aridity and widespread erosion of the Altithermal (Antevs 1962) of
ca. 7000 B.C., the climate and resultant biotic aggregates have been
relatively consistent. Of course, minor oecilations and even marked
regional droughts such as the Fairbanks, about 500 B.C., and the
Great or Pueblo Drought, ca. 1300 A.D. (Antevs 1962), have occurred
and were accompanied by eolian erosion, channe!-filling, and other
dry period landscape shaping phenomena. Nonetheless, these recurrent
elimatie episodes are not known to have produced drastic shifts in
flor!l and faunal assemblages. However, an unmeasurable factor in
assessing changes or shifts in the habitat is man, i.e., modern farmers
and ranchers whose activities have greatly modified not only the
biotic relationships, but the topography itself. This fact presents one
of the major difficulties in projecting present-day environmental conditions into the past with any reasonable degree of assurance of
comparability. However, it is believed that changes due to human
agency are predominantly quantitative rather than qualitative.
Figure 2 illustrates a generalized composite cross section of the
microhabitats or biotopes which exist today in the Sweetwater-Catlett
Creeks valley. Concise descriptions of each of these zones are provided below.
1. BATârUItE SAND BAR. Batture sand bars are presented in Catlett
and Sweetwater Creeks but lack the characteristic development of
corresponding phenomena in river systems to the east of the Trinity
drainage. Although similar depositional forces are operative on a
miniature scale in Catlett and Sweetwater Creeks, the general stage
seems to still be one of downcutting. Correspondingly, the batture

walls are steep, and maximum alluvial accretion occurs only on those
slopes of the most steeply convoluting meanders. At these points, clean
white sands of true bar development are noted.
No cultural debitage, which would testify to aboriginal utilization
of these areas, was recovered from any of the accunmlations. This is
not unexpected for these features are highly unstable and theoretically
tend to migrate downstream) In such a ease, cultural refuse would
either be washed away or covered very quickly.
2. NATURAL LEVEE. Natural levees bordering Catlett and Sweetwater Creeks are very narrow and poorly developed. Characteristically, they are ahnost imperceptible rises of only a few inches to a
foot directly adjacent to the stream banks. The primary reason for distinguishing this biotope is that the loosely consolidated, better drained
sandy soils near the edges of the stream channel support a distinctive
growth of vari-storied vegetation (cf. microzones 4-5 and 6). Pecan,
blackwalnut, rattan, red oak, burr oak, elm, hackberry, locust, and
briars are the prevalent woody species. Fauna occupying this niche
are squirrel, raccoon, opossum, and various transient predators including bobcat and wolf.
3. FLOODPLAIN. The area between the natural levee and the dissected upland escarpment is the alluvial floodplain. Within the survey boundaries, the average width varies from no more than a few
hundred yards to almost three-quarters of a mile. Generally it is a
flat fertile plain dissected in a few spots by intermittent rivulets,
which are the products of upland runoff. Grassland cover is predominant today and was probably the floral condition in the past. However, it should be noted that ranchers and farmers are very active in
this zone and the extent of modification cannot be accurately measured. The zone today furnishes the habitat for several mammalian
and avian species, such as field rat, rabbit, skunk, coyote, fox, grouse,
and quail. In years past, it may have also supported some bison, as
a buffalo skull was exhumed by local residents from the bank of
Sweetwater Creek some years previous to this reconnaissance (Cody
Caraway, verbal comnmnication, 1968).
A possible deterrent factor for aboriginal settlement in this biotope
was frequent inundation. If figures compiled for the last 30 years for
the Denton Creek Watershed can be projected with any degree of
validity into the past, the area seems to have been subjected to rather
persistent flooding. Although the mean annual precipitation is only
31.56 inches and is usually distributed throughout the year, individ1 The general hypothesis of downstream migration of meanders and

ual excessive rains may produce widespread flooding (Soil Conservation Service 1965:6). Since 1935 there have been 36 major floods
which covered more than one half of the floodplain (Soil Conservation Service 1965:9).
4-5. REMNANT TERRACE AND HICHER TERI~ACE. These mierohabitats
are discussed as one unit for the faunal and floral features are basieally
similar. Remnant terraces are physically part of the higher terraces
that have been completely isolated by erosion. Soils of these zones
are graveliferous sandy loams and red and yellow tenacious clays.
Often those members fringing the upland escarpment are littered by
limestone talus and in some areas colluvial fans are prevalent.
Although recent clearing has denuded sections of this zone, scattered
groves of oak, walnut, bois dâ are, ehn, haekberry, and various shrubs
are present, primarily near runoff gullies. Grasses grow in areas
not in woods. Native fauna include squirrel, opossum, rabbit, an
occasional Virginia deer, and rarely predators such as fox, bobcat,
and wolf.
This mierohabitat is abundant in food and material resources, is
well-drained, is almost never inundated, is sheltered from the persistent north wind, and is in proximity of every other biotope. It was
therefore not unexpected that the only site of any size in the survey
area was located in this biotope.
6. UPLAND ESCARPMENT-ROLLING PRAIRIE. This zone, which actually
consists of several microenvironments, corresponds to the grassland
portion of the Grand Prairie Physiographic Provenience (Fenneman
1938:105). It is true prairie with an aggregation of grasses including
bluestem, Indiangrass, switehgrass, dropseed, and buffalo. Prickly pear
is rarely found, and its presence may be due to recent human transportation. Woody vegetation, such as live oak, post oak, blackjack
oak, and black locust is limited to the peripheries of the escarpment
or to well-watered spots. Skunk, rabbit, coyote, quail, grouse, and
probably bison (in previous years) utilize the forage and cover provided by this zone. Prominent elevations in the upland escarpment
provide excellent panoramic views of the surrounding country.
SITES AND THE ENVIRONMENT
SITE X41WSl
Site X41WS1 is located in mieroenvironment 4-5, about 20 yards
east of the Sweetwater Creek-Catlett Creek confluence. The occupation area, which is approximately 80 feet in diameter, lies atop a
remnant terrace outlier.
Although there was a paucity of cultural refuse, 3 discrete coneen-

204

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

trations of material pointed to task-specific areas. Conforming generally to the crest of the terrace was an area approximately 40 feet
in diameter littered with burned limestone rocks. Immediately outside
this fired zone in 9. spots were accumulations of flakes. Scattered
throughout the site, including the burned area, were dart point flagments, pebble hammerstones, grinding-stones, ground axe and/or celt
fragments, and a possible plummet.
ARTIFACTS OF

CHIPPED STONE

PROJECTILE POINTS: TWO distal fragments of dart points and 1 contracting long stemmed dart point (probably Gary or possibly Wells)
were recovered. The nearly complete point was approximately 55
ram. long and 9.0 ram. wide. Several other points are noted as having
been picked up from the surface (B. C. Pitts, verbal communication,
1968). One of the fragments and the point were made of quartzite,
and the other fragment was of waxy Central Texas flint.
DEBITAGE: Debitage consisted of 20 small flakes; the majority about
equally derived krona the two flake accumulations mentioned above.
These irregular and unmodified pieces were simply thinning or trimming flakes resulting krona tool or projectile point repair. No cores
were present.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE

PEBBLE HAMMERSTONES: Eight pebbles of quartz, chert, and sandstone have marks ok attrition or battering around the peripheries
which suggests their probable function as hammerstones. The amount
of wear is variable, ranging krona slight to moderate.
AXES AND/OR CELTS: This rather inclusive heading describes 2 bit
fragments and 1 poll fragment from X41WS1. Only the poll fragment
is complete enough to identify it as a kull-grooved rectangular axe.
The other 2 pieces are too small to determine if they were axes or
celts. The objects were made ok ochreous siltstone, fossiliferous limestone, and exotic diorite.
MANO: A sub-rectangular piece ok sandstone is judged to have
functioned as a mano. The edges have been battered and only 1 face
is well-smoothed.
ABI:IADED SLAB: A small slab of wel!-consolidated laminar siltstone
had abraded surfaces. Several lightly etched grooves are present on 2
faces. The object may have served as a whetstone.
PLUMMET: An ovoid hematite concretion with a groove worn severa!
centimeters below the apex may have functioned as a plummet or
bolastone. Except for the groove, the specimen has not been modified
in any fashion.

OTHER: Fire-cracked or reddened stone, fragments of fresh-water
mussels, and 1 small piece of calcined bone (deerP), complete the
entire inventory of the products or refuse of human activity at
X41WS1.
The smallness of the site, the paucity of artifacts, the limited number of task-specific areas, and the presence of tools normally considered to be masculine articles point to the probability of the site
having functioned as a short duration camp for a small number of
men. It is further suggested that a group of men minus spouses carrying on so few vital activities, certainly insufficient for total culture
maintenance, intimates by analogy with ethnographic data at least
two alternatives. The first is that the site represents an in-route stop
of a raiding party, and the second and favored alternative is that it is
simply a hunting camp.
It is deduced from the few artifacts and inferred activities at
X41WS1 that the occupants were active in exploiting several of the
contiguous mieroenvironments. Limestone talus from the higher slopes
of microenvironment 4-5 was imported for hearth stone. The residue
from limited tool repair suggests that the raw material came largely
from the few channel gravels of microenvironment 1 or from a gravel
quarry in mieroenvironment 5, some 2 miles west of the survey boundaries. A few pieces of exotic stone, i.e., Central Texas flint and diorite,
allude to extraneous connections or sources. Fragments of freshwater mussels as well as the recognized biological necessity for drinking water testify to further utilization of mieroenvironment 1. A single
scrap of calcined bone tentatively identifed as deer indicates that
at least some of the hunting endeavors were channeled into microenvironment 4-5.
The data are too inconclusive to positively assert the period of
occupancy, although they implicate an Archaic type of huntinggathering economy if not an Archaic period temporal position.
SITE X41WS2
A single other location, dubiously accorded site status, was present
within the survey area. The geographic coordinates are Longitude
97Â°27â51" and Latitude 33015â22" which places it north of highway
24 and approximately 150 yards north of Sweetwater Creek. The
"site" consists of an area about 10 feet in diameter which shows signs
of human activity.
ARTIFACTS

DEBITAGE: This category contains 5 flakes, of which 2 are rather

TEXAS AIICHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

prismatic. At least 3 different pebbles of quartz and local chert seem
to have been worked.
I-IAMMEnSTONE: One ovoid quartz pebble has slight abrasions on
one edge which may indicate its function as a hammerstone.
The confined spatial dimensions, the absence of any kind of finished
tool, and indeed the dearth of any artifactual remains point to the
utilization of this spot by a single occupant for a very short period
of time.
The site occupies a portion of an upper slope of microenvironment 4-5. Pebbles of chert are present on the crest (microenvironment 6) of the ridge above. The site overlooks one of the wooded
fingers of microenvironment 4-5 which extends along a drainage
ravine, and game could have been observed most easily. Perhaps most
importantly, the area is sheltered from the prevailing north wind.
CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY
Although the reservoir area was searched systematically and thoroughly, the two aforementioned sites were the only ones discovered.
Several other ideal spots were carefully examined but yielded no
indication of ever having been utilized. Congruently, the two sites
which are found appear to represent the very limited activities of a
few individuals for a short period of time. This brings us to an
interesting point; one from which departure to predictive hypotheses
of culture operation may be launched.
A number of sites are known from areas adjoining structure 28,
primarily along Denton Creek and the upper reaches of Catlett and
Sweetwater Creeks. Although only one of these sites was examined
personally, artifact assemblages from several other sites were observed
in private collections. From the holdings of assured provenience, it
is possible to induce considerably more functions for the sites from
which they were taken than for those sites within the survey boundaries by the simple fact that a considerably larger number and
variety of tool types were represented. Wider variety within the tool
kit alludes to more patterned activities of the cultural group. Hence
it is logical to assume that the sites in structure 28, from which only
cooking, stone tool maintenance, and hunting and gathering activities
may be inferred, do not appear to typify complete, self-sustaining
cultural entities. Therefore, it is posited that these small sites are
actually functionally-specific activity units, i.e., hunting camps, of a
larger socio-cultural system which perhaps centered along Denton
Creek. Of course, it goes without saying that this hypothesis is operational within the present conceptual framework, but the burden of

DENTON

CREEK

WATERSHED

9,07

validation or rejection ultimately rests with future survey and
excavation.
Assuming for a moment that the environment is responsible for the
differences in settlement and activity patterns in the two areas, then it
is feasible to look for some factor or faetors physical or cultural, which
would preclude permanent occupation in the reservoir area. It is suggested that the impermaneney of occupation in the area is basieally due
to the ephemeral availability of water. Supporting data for this proposal include: 1. a greater number of sites on Denton Creek and the
spring-freshened headwaters of Catlett and Sweetwater Creeks where
a more voluminous and more dependable water supply was assured,
and 9.. the fact that the portions of Catlett and Sweetwater Creeks
within the survey boundaries are known to have gone dry during
periods of drought.
Thus, although settlement stability was hindered, the area was still
oeeasiona!ly frequented by hunting and/or foraging parties, who were
apparently attracted by the natural bounty of the landscape. Indeed,
the necessity for permanent occupancy may never have arisen as the
area was readily accessible from the villages or base camps on Denton
Creek. Carrying the proposal further, it is conceivable that the presence of the small camp sites may be correlated with a daily or seasonal
exploitation of the abundant mast crops or game. However, this is
beyond corroboration by the available evidence and is certainly
speculative at this point.
A ease for the relationship between habitat and culture has been
proposed by Quimby (1960:382) who writes:
Under certain conditions a hunting culture will develop to the limits of its
habitat and in so doing will acquire forms determined by the habitat.

Quimby has perhaps overstated his point, for it alludes to a deterministie quality of the natural environment. Nonetheless, the general
idea, possibly more aptly expressed by Meggers (1954:801-89,4), as the
limiting effects of the environment, has provided the core of this diseussion. It is beyond question that rapport between culture and nature
must be established if the former is to survive.
If culture is viewed as manâs extrasomatie adaptation (White
1959:8), then understanding of the paleoeeologieal relationships will
assist the archaeologist in making soeio-eultural interpretations. This is
precisely the goal advocated two decades ago by Taylor (1948), but
which received concerted attention only recently (Longaere 1964;
Coe and Flannery 1967; MaeNeish 1964; Binford 1962).
This report has brought out some of the intricacies of the cultureenvironment relationship in a small area of North-Central Texas.

X41MU15, A SITE ON THE HEADWATERS
OF DENTON CREEK, MONTAGUE COUNTY, TEXAS
BLAKE L. BENHAM
INTRODUCTION
The present paper deals with a site located within the Denton Creek
Watershed. The site was loeated during a survey of multi-purpose
structure No. 1 C, a Soil Conservation Serviee dam providing rural
domestic and livestock water with incidental recreational benefits.
The specific area of study is at the headwaters of Denton Creek,
where the channels of two branehes meet, one flowing from the north,
the other from the west. The dam spans the northern branch about
a quarter of a mile upstream from the point of confluence. The reservoir lies eight miles east of Bowie and seven miles south of Montague
in the north central portion of Montague County, Texas.
SITE SETTING
Being the upper portion of the Trinity Watershed, the sixty mile
drainage of Denton Creek flows southeasterly through three major
land resource areas: the West Cross Timbers, the Grand Prairie, anJ
the East Cross Timbers (SCS Work Plan 1965:3-5). The site,
X41MU15 is located within the West Cross Timbers, a region eharacterized by rolling topography of early Cretaeeous formations which
are severely incised by Denton Creek and its tributaries (Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer 1932:278). Although the soil series for each of the
land resource areas differ in terms of their resistance to erosion, the
primary changes in ehannel forms between the upper and lower
reaches of this watershed are the result of stream dynamics. In the
upper reaches, headward erosion is evidenced by the abandonment

9,10

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

of catch basins in combination with the cutting of V-shaped channels.
The catch basin remnants bear a striking resemblance to floodplains,
but are structurally dissimilar, and occupy extended areas far beyond
the channel peripheries and remain as isolate canyons that occur at
varying intervals for a distance of three miles downstream.
In sum, a transition from a youthful to a more mature channel
development is readily observable in the drainage basin. On the lower
reaches there are small, but definable natural levees and terraces
within an active floodplain. More youthful and still in the process of
headward erosion, the upper channel has become entrenched to the
extent that 30 meter high escarpments rise steeply from the shâeam
banks confining the water course and restricting floodplain development to a minimum. The site lies atop such an escarpment to the east
of the confluence of the north and west branches of Denton Creek.
This is the location of the last abandoned catch basin from which "the
creek has since migrated.
Approximately six miles to the northwest, three variations of the
West Cross Timbers environment become apparent. These variations
are distinguished by a change in type and density of vegetation which
corresponds to changes in soil type and topography. The site is !ocated on the western fringe of a densely wooded area, composed
largely of post and blackjack oak which is restricted primarily to the
east of the 1000â MSL contour. West of this contour and extending
north to the Red River (an area known locally as the Badlands), are
the Windthorst-Nimrod Prairie types, (Carter 1931:79-81) which
support only sparse vegetation of small mesquite trees, buffalo grass
and grama grasses. This vegetation grades almost imperceptibly into
the Rolling Plains by the Nimrod Prairie Soils, on the northeast by
the 1000â MSL contour and reaching northward to the Red River is
a moderately open savannah that can best be described as a "transitional" area containing representative traits of the bordering vegetations.
The watershed divide which separates the Red River and Trinity
River drainages is less than three miles to the north of the site. In
addition to the vantage points afforded by the crest, within half a
mile north and east of the site, there are strategic promontories providing views over an extensive area.
Other than the deviations introduced by the presence of abandoned
catch basins and the youthful character of the upper segment of "the
drainage system, the mieroenvironmental resources described for
Catlett Creek in the preceding paper give a full account of the environs of the site proper.

SITE DESCRIPTION
The site consists of two distinct concentrations of chipped stone
material, one along the summit, and the other on the slope of the
escarpment (Fig. 1). Both concentrations cover a maximum area of
seventy-five by thirty meters. The upper concentration contains

9,19, .

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

numerous small secondary retouch flakes in an area approximately
fifteen by three meters, with the long axis oriented east-west paralleling the edge of the escarpment. No material was eollected from the
upper area. It was decided that a collection would destroy any patterned distribution that might be present. (See Hayden 1965:272).
The lower concentration is composed of primary (cortex) and
initial flakes (Honea 1965:29). A number of these larger flakes were
collected as they were representative of resource material which
occurred in the upper concentrations. Furthermore, although the distribution of the material may be skewed by contour plowing of the
escarpment slope, the area on the summit appeared to be undisturbed
by this practice.
The resource materials included fine-grained quartzite found in
the immediate environs and on the Red River, locally derived cherts,
and opaque grey to black Central Texas flint from more distant
locales. Gravels and relatively large chunks of limestone and sandstone occur in proximity to the site, but give no indication of being
utilized by the occupants. No finished tools were recovered.
SUMMAItY AND CONCLUSIONS
Since the cultural material of X41MU15 suggests a very limited
range of activities, the problem of interpreting the site is primarily
one of relating the evidence to a larger whole or pattern of adaptation.
The available data cannot be taken to represent the remains of a
total cultural pattern; but rather, the site evidences certain activities
which are part of a round of life that encompasses a sizeable geographic area.
Although the evidence is not conclusive, it is proposed that the site
indicates the pursuance of hunting and may reflect a hunting and
gathering economy. Pending further investigation, this is a tentative
perspective. The situation of the site might be brought forward in
support of this interpretation. From the site area an accurate account
can be made of the movements of game along the canyon slopes and
within the catch basin remnant below; this argument stresses the
strategic location of the site for hunting. Decidedly, success in hunting
depends upon the vulnerability of game within certain settings,
whereas the heavily wooded uplands offer a greater amount of cover
and would put the hunter at a disadvantage.
More specifically, the site may be envisioned as a preparatory step
in the pursuance of hunting activities. A substantial number of secondary retouch and initial (Honea 1965) flakes are most closely
aligned to "sharpening" and shaping of tool forms. If tools were

DENTON CREEK ~WATERSHED

213

used on the spot, some it seems would have been found as utilized discards. It is suggested then, that the site served only an instrumental
function in the killing of game and not the goal-satisfying or end
consequences, i.e. kill site.
Further, there is the question whether one or several persons prepared tools on the site at successive occasions or whether the chipping
areas resulted from one hunt carried out by a number of persons. An
analysis of the distribution of flakes over the site area should be
conducted concerning the organization of hunting practices. One thing
seems certain: the high density of secondary retouch flakes in relation
to the other flake classes is highly suggestive that preforms and
debitage blanks received final treatment on the site and that preliminary treatment of the materials was achieved elsewhere.
This means that we are dealing with a point in time in which a
stone-working process was in operation. The material, therefore,
refers to a specific spatial dimension in which an economy operated.
In this sense, the site is a study complete within itself, for the
process of resource alteration and the economic pursuit with which
the material is so closely linked (whether hunting or gathering) has
become a matter of exploiting and accommodating to space.
Ethnologically derived models of hunting and gathering economies
provide insights into the general mechanics of their operation, but the
spatial dimensions of completed economic cycles are a perplexing
problem from the outset. The variations in enviromnents and climates,
in how particular resource users assemble a subjective picture of "the
environment (Blaut 1959:92), and in the technological orientation
of the users, are some of the classes of multivariate phenomena within
the spatial scheme. It is in how these "stage settings" are employed by
cultural-economic processes that dimensions of space become prescribed. Archaeological reconnaissance must subscribe to an unknown
spatial dimension, especially when dealing with hunting-gathering
economies, and through the location of sites provide information
necessary to synthesize and tentatively define a spatial adaptive pattern or patterns.

Component Analysis for Archaic Sites
JOEL L. SrnNER
ABSTRACT
Before one talks about loci, or other time-space units, he should understand the components from which they are built. This study attempts to
define components in terms of more comprehensive typological and technological traits.

INTRODUCTION
One of several new trends in American archaeology is the attempt
to do prehistoric studies within the framework of anthropology.
Although archaeologists have discussed this on the theoretical level
since the end of World War II, it has only been since 1965 that the
techniques have developed that will really permit it. These techniques
include the study of stone technology, a modern typology for tools, and
new ways of comparing and ordering data. More than anything else
the techniques are used not just to study material objects, but to study
the people that made them.
There is little to gain fiâom pointing out the futility of continuing
with the older form of taxonomy. Foci based on two or three material
culture traits are not steps toward understanding past cultures.
Despite protests to the contrary, there is no possibility nor intent for
this kind of archaeology to progress beyond the art history of projectile points.
Foci that are intended to reflect the behavior of people and not
just groupings of material objects must be based on sound components. Sound components rarely emerge from excavations and surveys
that stress only stratigraphic analysis and collection of a few typological tools. Instead the component must be based on the specific
material culture of one group of people. It is precisely the same concept that is embodied in the word assemblage which was defined as
"the surviving material culture of a single resident group over a short
period of time at a specific locality" (Marks, Wendorf and Shiner,
1967).
In theory, the focus ought to be the surviving material culture of
a society over a period of time so short that cultural evolution would
be no major factor. Seasonal specialization, however, would be considered.
Many of the southwestern and southern plains sites are on the
surface and cover vast areas. More often than not, it is difficult or
impossible to determine where one camp ends and another begins.

Site 25, fire hearth just beginning to erode.

Any collections from one of these sites runs the risk of including
artifacts of distinct periods or of more than one society. No end of
confused data could emerge, especially in mistakened associations.
Small, isolated, single component sites that were quite rich in tools
and other artifacts would be ideal for discovering the material culture
array of a local group. Unfortunately, sites of that quality are rare, and
we must work with the larger units.
It is the purpose of this paper to indicate how it may be possible to
isolate components from these large sites. The approach is simple
enough. One should collect and analyze as small an area as possible,
but one large enough to provide an adequate statistical sample of
behavioral traits. The area collected should be one which still shows
a considerable degree of intact structure. In other words, where use
areas and fire hearths are still discernible (Fig. 1). The list of traits

COMPONENT

ANALYSIS

should be considerably enlarged by recognizing that there are many
stone tools usually ignored by American archaeologists, and huge
amounts of material that clearly define the processes of stone tool
manufacture. There is no reason to believe that these behavioral
traits are of less importance than projectile points.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
For severa! reasons study collections were made within the Tamaulipas area (Kaâoeber, 1939). Sites were available, they were "rich",
and they were relatively undisturbed by cultivation or by collectors.
This area is the brush country of south Texas and northern Mexico,
south of the Frio River, northeast of the hills around Monterrey, and
west of the Gulf Coast. In previous literature, the area was included
in a hastily conceived Baleones Phase (Kelley, 1960), or divided into
ill-defined Falcon and Mier Foei. These divisions rested on little geographical and less archaeological information. The present study does
not pretend to rectify the situation or to substitute new "culture area"
concepts. It is only the beginning of a series of studies within an area
of reasonably uniform environment.
The Tamaulipas Area is dominated by two things: the relatively
flat to slightly hilly brush expanse, and the dendritic drainage pattern
centered on the Rio Grande. Overall, there is a gradual shift from
drier and more open country in the west to more vegetation in the
east. There are several repeated microenvironments. One of these, the
Rio Grande Floodplain, seems to be of minor importance as regards
settlements. Only a few small sites show on the terrace surfaces or in
the buried silts. The banks may have been used, however, for hunting
and gathering. Three other mieroenvironments are worth mentioning
at this time: the low floodplains of the major creeks, the extensive
brush "âflats" and the hilltops. Each of these offered certain ecological
advantages (Newton, 1968). The floodplain and hills served as areas
for foraging and as a source of raw materials for stone tools. The
"flats" were normally used as camp sites as well as ~for hunting and
gathering.
Site 9,5 lies immediately beside Santa Isabel Creek about 25 miles
northwest of Laredo, and within the highest area of the floodplain.
All indications were that floodwaters had frequently covered the site,
but not before the undisturbed features themselves had been covered
with soil and grass. The hearths and associated artifacts were eroding
for the first time when the collection was made. Two contiguous
hearth areas were collected here in order to obtain an adequate
sample of artifacts for a hypothecated component.

FIGURE 2.

Site 26 is in the identical position, geologically, but on the opposite
side of the creek, some 200 meters southwest of site 25. The hearths
and artifacts are eroding from an in situ position in the terrace where
they had been buried with minimum disturbance. Two contiguous
hearths provided a collection of artifacts numerically adequate for
comparison with those from Site 25. It is not the intent of this article
to argue for a specific number of artifacts as being an "adequate"
sample, but rather good results have been obtained in Europe and
Africa with collections of over 100 tools plus the accompanying debris
and debitage.
Site 27 lies on the surface of the flat valley some 600 meters east
of the Santa Isabel Creek. The site is larger than 50 meters in dianaeter, but parts of it are still buried beneath the alluvium and the

COMPONENT

ANALYSIS

limits are not determinable. Although this area of occupation is at a
considerable distance from the actual creek bed, its elevation is little
more than two meters above the high flood plain of the creek. Much
of the area between the site and the creek is low flood plain and
unsuitable for permanent occupation.
Incidentally, the settlement patterns along Santa Isabel strongly
suggest that the elevation of the flood plain, the entrenchment of the
creek, and the amount of summer thunder-shower runoff may have
changed but little since Archaic times. Not more than one occupation
level may be seen in any given cut-bank (Fig. 2).
The surface of the site is thickly strewn with debris and debitage.
In almost the center of the site are the remains of a small LatinAmerican farm house, and the local public road runs right beside the
site. Point hunters have worked this and other sites in the area for
more than two generations, but each major rain uncovers new material. The collection was made immediately after a series of heavy rains
in the strip of just exposed materials at the east (upslope) edge of
the site.
Site 9,7 no longer shows the structure of an undisturbed site, but
was apparently deflated at one time and re-covered by grass and soil
(Fig. 3). Parts of it were eroding again when the eo!leetion was made.
The artifacts collected, are not necessarily from any given hearth, but
were collected within an area large enough to provide a reasonable
sample.
Since early and late sites appear together in the same microenvironments and are both absent from others, it may be assumed that there
has been little change in the topography since Archaic times. This
increases the possibility of overlapping camp sites. Indeed, where any
erosion, whether aeolian or fluviatile, has taken place on the flats,
camp debris is usually visible. Almost every ranch house in the entire
area is located on or quite near a major prehistoric site.
A great many, possibly most, of the sites in the area are marked by
fire hearths. Varner (1968) noted such concentrations of fire-broken
rock over considerable areas of northern Nuevo Leon and eastern
Coahuila. The hearths described in this paper are similar in size,
three to five feet in diameter. Scattered about each hearth are quantities of tools, debris, debitage and use-retouch artifacts.

THE ARTIFACTS
The assumption is that the artifacts are associated with the hearth
and are the products of a single group and of a relatively short span
of time. If this is true, other hearths in the vicinity may have been

occupied by members of the same group. Such a hypothesis cannot
be tested by comparing projectile points because statistically meaningful samples would not be obtainable (Table I). By adding scrapers
and the so called "knives", the samples can be increased but rarely
can it reach significant levels with only these tools being considered
(Table II).
The enlarged trait list used in this experiment is believed to include
sufficient artifacts with which to make comparisons among systematic
collections. It includes tools which qualify as such because they are
modified in certain systematic ways. As far as it is possible and practical to do so, type names based on suspected use have been abandoned.
This eliminates such categories as "knife" and opens the possibility
that some of these are stages in manufacture. Pieces that have been

called spokeshaves elsewhere are referred to herein as notches in
order to protect against unwarranted speculation. In addition, the
study includes among the tools such things as burins, dentieulates,
truncations and retouched (intentional) flakes. Most discussions of
the Archaic ignore these. Scrapers are divided into categories based
on morphology rather than on material (Table II).
There are three other categories besides the tools. They are debris
(cores, ehips, cortex flakes and bifaee thinning flakes), debitage
(flakes suitable for chipping into tools) and use retouch flakes (flakes
that show wear patterns on edges). This group of non-tools which
may range from S0 to 9070 of all artifacts, provides the main sample
for comparison and contrast with other collections.

FICURE 4. Scrapers: a, end-scraper (nosed); b, end-scraper; c, and e,
multiple-edge scrapers; d, side-scraper; f, side-scraper (tranverse); g, multiple-edge scraper (dejetd).
Scrapers from all three sites are similar. A very few are made on
cortex or simple secondary flakes. The majority are shaped by flaking
over the convex or "upper" face and around the edges. One long edge,
sometimes two edges, are beveled and finely retouched. Bulbs of
percussion often are truncated away or have been reduced by flat
retouch. Some of the side scrapers can be classified as simple, some
as transverse and some having multiple edges (Fig. 4).
Foliates are larger than projectile points, but otherwise similar to
the Abasolo-Catan and Tortugas-Matamoras types (Fig. 5). These
are finished pieces that have been both thinned by billet and finished
by pressure retouch.
The biface preforms may have been intended as projectile points or
something else, but they were not completed.
Truncations are flakes or blades whose proximal or distal ends have
been removed by deliberate chipping. One purpose of truncation
is bulb reduction, but the reason for distal truncation is not known.
The so called "gouges" would seem to include several varieties. No
information is available on what these tools represent (Fig. 6).
Choppers show bifacial work along one or more edges, plus evidence on both faces of the edge that they have been used for chopping.

Burins are on snapped flakes (Fig. 8 a, b, c, e), on truncations (Fig.

Classification of retouched flakes is difficult, especially in distinguishing these deliberately made tools fiâom the use-retouch pieees.
The key to the problem is not to make any decisions until all of the
artifacts have been examined. The deliberate retouch will stand out
as patterned and regular, and the chipping will be of the same direction and force. Use retouch normally produces finer chips that are
more irregular in spacing, direction and relative size.
Artifacts in Table III include debris, an inclusive term for the
unwanted and unused "trash" left over from making tools and usable
flakes or blades. Debitage could be called "blank flakes or blades" as
these pieces have not been altered further by chipping or by use.
Table IV lists the breakdown of the debris. Bifaee thinning flakes
(Fig. 9 a, b) show a faceted platform which is indeed a part of the
opposite face of the bifaee. It is undoubtedly a product of a billet and
is from the second stage of a biface production (Fig. 9 e, d). The
first stage is demonstrable as percussion, the second as billet-thinning
and the third as pressure retouch.

Although cortex flakes are occasionally made into tools (scrapers
or denticulates) the practice is to classify unmodified specimens as
debris.
Cores are self-explanatory, but chips sometimes cause problems in
classification. Chips include material removed from cores or material
removed from flakes or rubble in the process of making something
else. These chips are too small or too irregular to be used as raw material for producing most of the tools in the collection. Admittedly, some
arbitrary decisions must be made in regard to dimensions, but these
can be reduced by studying the tools.
RESULTS
Now that the typological tools have been listed and the technological attributes calculated, we may proceed to the direct comparison of the three sites. It should be recalled that each site collection
contains over 1340 artifacts and over 130 tools.
Compare the projectile points in Table I. The three sites have
equal numbers of the Abasolo-Catan continuum, but that proves
nothing. These so-called types have no temporal or spatial significance.
The other forms of identifiable points show no pattern of similarity or
significant difference. Obviously, a dozen or so identifiable points are
of little use in comparing and contrasting sites. But, this may be the
largest sample available in a real component (material remains of a
local gToup).

Compare the tools in Table II. This time there can be little doubt
of the extraordinary resemblance among the three collections. Each
tool, with only one exception, is represented at each site in reasonably
similar frequencies.
The technological attributes reveal extremely close resemblances
between sites 27 and 26, but an apparent difference between these
two and site 25 Table III. The difference resolves itself into a considerably larger anlount of chips in the latter site (Table IV).
The conclusion must be that the three collections are similar in so
many ways that they can hardly be other than components of the

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

same abstraction: the material remains of a society over a relatively
short period of time.
Unless the environment has changed considerably since these sites
were occupied, I would conclude that the camps are primarily for
foraging. Projectile points suggest hunting. The present abundance of
reptiles, crayfish, freshwater mussels, various seeds, roots and fiâuit
suggest that gathering might have been productive.
There is ethnographic evidence from other areas (Collier, Hudson,
and Ford, 1949.:38 and Shiner, 1961) that suggests that the hearths
may be the remains of small earth ovens. If true, this may add to the
probability that various roots as well as meat were cooked. From the
condition of the fractured rock, it is quite probable that each earth
oven was used only once, certainly not more than twice. Thus, a single
hearth and associated debris may be the result of only a few days of
residence.
Almost every site in the San Isabel drainage that has not been
deflated conforms in gross structure to those described in this paper.
The exceptions are flaking stations among the low gravel-covered
hills and quite small concentrations without hearths. The latter are
nearly always associated with quantities of small thin "arrow" points,
and are considered to be later than the Archaic stage.
CONCLUSIONS
The social organization of a group of people camping together will
depend upon a great many things. Season, activity, kinship system,
basic economic patterns, environment, organization of the whole
society, all will affect the size, nature and organization of the camp.
The patterns of the debris vary also according to these influences.
Ideally, I suppose, a component should be the material remains of
a central base camp where most of the important activities are
originated, to which most of the economic products are brought, and
where most of the artifacts are made. The science of archaeology has
not yet demonstrated the existence of such sites for the Archaic period.
This paper has suggested that more thorough descriptions and
analyses of smaller systematic collections can lead to a better understanding of what small groups were doing. In this study, logistic
problems did not permit the recording of scatter patterns, a technique
which would have added the dimensions of structure to the other
dimensions of typology and technology.
The study does, however, show that the behavior patterns of certain small groups, as reflected by their artifacts, can in certain situations, be amazingly similar. The things made and the techniques of

29,9

COh~[PONENT ANALYSIS

making them are so nearly alike that a good case could be made for
calling them all components of the same environmental adaptation.
This implies that each of these individual collections are the material
remains of members of the same society at about the same time, who
were engaged in just about the same activities.
It is believed that the use of techniques such as those described in
this paper will permit archaeologists interested in the Archaic or
Paleo periods to resume the study of the people instead of being side
tracked into pure taxonomy of tools. These techniques do not answer
the main aims of archaeology which are history and process. They
are steps in the direction of the prerequisite to these, namely description.

Arrow Shafts for Stone Points
J. B. SOnLBERCER
ABSTRACT
A project-approach is designed to find and define logical lithie tools.
Arrow shaft notching saws, abrading knives, scrapers, and planing knives
are described physically and comparatively on the basis of cutting edge
type. Hard substances like wood or bone are found to be more readily and
efficiently worked with tools having edges without retouch or other flaking.

INTRODUCTION
It seems to me that research of this nature needs a word or two of
explanation. After the laboratory analysis and classification of the
artifacts, there normally was a residue of specimens which were regarded as mere flakes. Some of these pieces are now believed to have
been used as tools. They are being subjected to an analysis to determine their technique of manufacture, and to note and describe any
effects of "use" that is discernible on them (Semenov, 1964).
There has as yet, been no particular emphasis or concern over what
may have been a specific job for these "tools" other than major divisions such as scraping or cutting. Rather, the emphasis has been on
how job use has affected or marked the tools. This approach only
verifies that the "tool" was used in some mechanical way. It does not
lead to identifying "tool" types for specific jobs.
Cultural change may be marked by the addition, or change, of
products. This may require a modification of old tools, a shift in the
relative frequency, or the creation of new types for new products. If
these new forms are ever to be recognized, we need to greatly expand
our knowledge of tools and pseudo tools. Special tool types should
point to specific products. The presence of certain tools may indicate
certain activities whether or not the product survived into an areheological inventory.
It is my belief that new tools may be recognized and eventually
be added to our inventory of types. These new tools by their names
will reflect major functions, or they will sub-divide classes. An example would be to sub-divide scrapers into: apparently best for bone,
apparently best for wood, etc. (that is, apparently in the laboratory
experiment ).
I think that if any success is to be recognized along these lines, it
will come from work projects designed to find the artifact tool that

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

will best do a specific job. Such a project is recorded in the following
text.
GATHERING THE WOOD STOCK
Numerous excursions into the field proved to the author that stone
axes were unsuitable for gathering shaftings of the proper diameter
for arrows. Chopping resulted in long tapering ends, or in mashing,
bruising, and splitting. The abrading knife (Sollberger, 1968b:97) in
the proper size, does a fine easy job of gathering raw materials for
arrow shafts. This tool will also quickly make the nook for a bow
string in the proximal end of the arrow.
DRESSING AND SIZING THE SHAFT
The shaftings need to be uniform in length, weight, and spine for
uniform performance. For this contouring, bifaces were found to be
worthless. They will not do suitably neat work because of the irregularity of edge type.
Sufficient time was spent by the author making shaftings to acquire
mechanical skill with lithic tools. One tool proved superior over all
the others in reducing the diameters, and contouring wooden handles
and shaftings. Uniface tools (scrapers) will do the work, but these
were positively found to be second best. Flake or spall type tools with
cutting edges formed by the intersecting line of two long flakes, make
by far the best wood and bone working tools. Such spalls with thin,
acute edge angles, can also be used as knives. These also may be
snapped or truncated to make (like glass) excellent wood scrapers.
However, the ultimate wood working tool is one that combines two
special flake features. In the following paragraphs this tool will be
referred to temporarily as a spall scraper. After a comparison of spall
edged scrapers to flaked edge scrapers in wood working is made, this
tool will be reclassified.
SPALL, OR NATURAL EDGED FLAKE SCRAPERS
The spall, or natural edge scrapers, that I have found to be the
superior type for working wood or bone can be selected from the
detritus of any lithic work shop, or, they can be made. From a mass,
strike a platform large enough to produce flakes x and a to d (Fig.
1, A). Strike flake x and discard it. The following flakes, a through d
are next struck to have in common this feature-that the plane surface
below the positive bulb will be convex on both axes. This will produce
four natural edge scraping implements that are knife-sharp and unblemished by other flake scar ridges.

are not present in use. The terms spall, or flake edge scraper, are inapplicable.

Now, with the aid of Fig. 1, B, the features will be listed that make
this scraper type superior on hard substances like wood or bone. 1.
The cutting edge is not marred by any ridge or irregularity. 2. The
cutting edge has a lineal continuous concavity along its upper face
that provides room for shavings to rise with a minimum of friction
or distortion. 3. In use, this edge is self cleaning with the addition of

234

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICALSOCIETY

a slight lateral motion to the forward motion. 4. This edge is much
longer lasting and capable of doing harder and tougher work because
a "use-flaking angle" is not present in its use. 5. The convex surface
below the cutting edge permits depth control over the shavings
raised. This is accomplished by raising or lowering the cortex end as
illustrated in Fig. 1, B. Gouging and rippling of the surface being
worked is greatly reduced by this large planer surface directly beneath the cutting edge. In that this cutting edge is directly in line with
the forward cutting motion, it will make thicker shavings with less
effort, with less edge breakage, and with smoother finish than will the
scrapers formed by chipping an edge.
FLAKED EDGE SCIIAPEtlS
The scrapers that have been assigned informal type names such as:
thumbnail, keelback, end, side, duckbill, spokeshave, etc. or classified
by a modified European system (Shiner, in Blaine et al. 1968:76) all
have one feature in common. That is, that the scraping edge is created
and/or shaped by a series of flakes. An analysis of the edge reveals the
following characteristics that are common to all scrapers. 1. Each
flake removed to initially form or to resharpen an edge, will leave two
ridges on the object face, and two ridge points at the edge being
formed. 2. The edge between these points will be concave or scalloped.
3. The faces between the flake scar ridges will be concave, and there
will be additional concavities-the negative bulb scars. Scrapers having these unalterable features proved to be considerably less efficient
and harder to use than are natural edged (spall type) scrapers on hard
substanees like wood or bone.
When in use on wood or bone, (Fig. 2, B) the following events
oceur that do not occur when using scrapers that have no flakes on
their cutting edges. 1. The ridge points striate the worked surface,
and it never becomes eompletely smooth. 9.. Full even surfaee contact
is not made without excessive downward pressure because of the
edge scallops and ridge points. 3. The ridge points must wear down
and become dull before the scraper edge can make full even contact.
4. The scraper is therefore, on hard substances, never more than
about fifty percent efllcient. 5. There is no depth control over the cut
other than downward pressure. This results in an excessive amount
of ripple and gougings on arrow shaft surfaces that can only be
removed by sanding or grinding. 6. Use-flaking of the edge occurs
on hard surfaces whether this type of scraper is pulled or pushed
into the work (Fig. 2, B). 7. The negative cavities create a thinness
at the very edge that often breaks under hard usage. 8. Flaked edge

Planer knife shavings. Square ends were cut with an abrading

cause of abrasion, breaks, and use-flaking. 9. The flaked edge scrapers
are continually clogging up with wood fibers (items 2, 3 and 4). The
edge contour (round to concave) of flaked edge scrapers seldom
permits the self eleaning lateral motion to be added to the forward
motion of the tool. The result here, is short broken shavings, and diagonal edge-gougings on the shaft being worked. Long continuous
shavings as made by spall type scrapers (Fig. 3) are therefore very
difficult to make with flaked edge scrapers.
THE PLANER KNIFE
Now that we have used both flaked edge scrapers and spall edged
scrapers on the same and identical arrow shaftings, it is abundantly
clear that the stone age man who was both a craftsman and artisan
probably would not labor on similar shaftings by using a flaked-edge
type scraper. It should also be clear that the spall type scraper that
combines a "hollow-ground" upper face with a convex lower face is
not a scraper, but, is properly a planing knife (Fig. 4).
Tool class in the functional sense is a determination of major mechanical activity that separates chopping, pounding, boring, grinding,
scraping, cutting, etc. Type recognizes variations that are similar
within class. Scrapers, as a class, have working edges that are designed
to be pressed or raked across a surface. The sharp edges are not in

line with the shavings raised or the cutting motion of the tool. Knives
are cutting and slicing tools. Their edges are forced into the work in
line and in plane with the cut desired. Lithie knives with very acute
cutting edge angles are extremely fragile When used on substances
as hard as wood or bone. Only very light side pressure is required to
nick or break such an edge. Therefore, the edge angle is increased to
prevent such damage as the hardness of the materials being worked
increases. Wood or bone working knives of the planer type must have
very strong or steep pitched working edges to prevent use flaking.
This strength is provided by the convex surface below the edge. This
convexity also serves as a depth gauge and planing bed, making it
possible to produce long unbroken shavings of uniform thickness. The
concave surface above the cutting edge serves the dual purpose of
reducing the force required in cutting and friction distortion of the
work done. The planer knife is forced directly into the work with
the edge motion in line or paralleling the cut. It therefore is not a
scraper, but a knife tool.
It is not known in what age stone workers discovered the superior
qualities of edges combining a concave upper face with a convex
lower face on a spall or flake, but this knowledge may have led to
some of the blade industries recognized in various parts of the world.
Perfection of this edge type extended into historic times in Mesoamerica. There, blades of obsidian were used as razors to shave with
by the early Spaniards and others. These prismatic blades that formed
polyhedral cores in their making (Crabtree, 1968:446) have edge
types similar to planer knives. In fact, most blades, in cross-section,
combine a convex lower face with a concave upper face in relation to
the cutting edge. The edge angle is adjusted to suit the valTing materials cut.

NOTCHING THE SHAFT
The preceding paragraphs have gathered the raw materials, shaped
the arrow shaft, and described the certain tools required. Notching
the distal end of arrow shafts, in which a stone point may be securely
mounted, requires two more tools.
Statistics gathered from measuring a large number of stone points,
tells us a number of facts that must apply in replicating an average
sized distal end and notch, to receive the point. The diameter of this
end will be reduced to about 6 ram. so that barbs or shoulders will
not be obstructed. The notch must extend in from the tip of the shaft
10 mm. The notch gap, in order to hold tightly the thinnest points,
must at times be no more than 3 mm. wide.
The tools to make the notch must have been available to all stone
age men. The limitation of size, strength, and hardness, dietates that
the tool material was the same as that from which the points were
made. Fig. 5, upper left, illustrates the notching-saw flake that made
the illustrated notches. The notching saw must have a few teeth (3
or 4) created by breaking small nieks from the lineal edge. Flaking

the edge will cause the tool to bind excessively and it then will not
cut free the wood particles from within the cut. The saw is used until
binding of its sides causes it to wedge in the cut. The knife-flake Fig.
5, upper right, is used to cut the sides of the deepening notch, parallel.
The alternate use of the saw and the knife will make notches of any
desired length. The notching saw must not have coarse teeth like
artifacts usually described as dentieulates. Each face of the saw
should be a single plane. The faces should be essentially parallel and
form a saw body often no thicker than 3 mm. for the thinner points.
The notching saw flakes and the knife flakes are normal by-products
of a lithie work shop. Billet flakes are especially adaptable. Notehings
for dart points and other larger haltings, permits the use of thicker
and larger tools. One good notching saw will make several notches in
soft green wood. Hard dry arrow shafts may require as many as two
or three saws to complete one notch. Heavily used saws have wear on
their edges that is easily felt or seen. The knives usually become
nicked on the working edge before a light polish is apparent.
ARTIFACTS, VERSUS SHOP TOOLS
All of the various tools used in this project I made in order to have
new, sharp, unworn cutting edges. Once it became determined that
the abrading knife, the notching saw and the planer knife were, to
me, the best possible tools for each phase of work, it became possible
to test the hypothesis. The work performed had provided the physical
features and method of using the tools in the laboratory. Knowing
now what to look for, artifact assemblages were examined, and artifacts in exact replica of the shop tools were found.
I have collected planer knives ,from a quarry-shelter site at the
Belton Reservoir, Texas. They average about four inches long, three
inches wide, and one and one-half inches thick at the bulb. The bulb
convexities are large and pronounced. Some examples have use-polish
from the cutting edge extending back under the convex lower face.
On others, where polish is not apparent, hand lenses show a smoothing that appears as a reduction of grain size of the stone surface. So
far, with artifacts, shine has been restricted to the bulb area itself.
Toward the distal end of the flake where cutting angles are more
acute, extensive use retouch is present without polish.
At the Acton Site (Blaine et al. 1968:45) where all lithic artifacts
and scrap were collected, no large flakes were present. However, I was
permitted to sort out all pieces which had the technical morphology of
the planer knife as I have discussed it. Examination of these edges
with five to fifteen power hand lenses showed use-flakes of the proper
character to indicate planer knife use. That is, use-retouch on the

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

240

lower convex face showed hinged flakes. Had the tool been used as
a scraper, the use flakes on the under convex face would be feathered
at the point of final separation, rather than hinged or broken off.
This demonstrates the possibility that those tools were inade and used
as I made and used the planer knife in the shop.
CONCLUSIONS
It must be noted, regarding the wood working conclusions of this
report, that green wood is much more easily worked. Seasoned wood
and all bone will use-flake any lithie tool with a sharp edge. Notchings
for halting purposes must be delayed until the wood is nearly dry.
Otherwise, the shaft or handle may split at the base of the notch during the seasoning interval.
The objectives of this project, initially stated in the introduction,
have been realized to the extent that several conclusions seem justified.
The replicating of bona fide stone age products (arrow shafts) should
help in identifying new tools for archaeological inventories. One of
these is the notching flake saw. This tool has no alternate when the
notch is for light thin arrow points. The abrading knife has no alternate equal for gathering shafting and handling wood stock, and in
making the proximal end nock for bow strings.
The planer knife is recognized here for the first time. It has no
equal among lithic tools for making long uniform wood shavings, as
far as laboratory experiments could determine.
A final conclusion is that wood scraping tools without retouch are
superior to retouched edge scrapers. It is conceded that retouching of
scraping edges for hard substances was probably done in the absence
of available new tool stock; or to create a necessary shape not available in spall form.

A Preliminary Report on the Development of a
Ceramic Chronology for the Sabine Lake Area of
Texas and Louisiana
LAWItENCE E.

ATEN AND CHAItLES N. BOLLICH

ABSTRACT
An extensive site survey was undertaken in the Sabine Lake area of Texas
and Louisiana with the intention of obtaining sufficient ceramic collections
to begin development of a ceramic chronology. Approximately 5,600 sherds
were examined, although collections from only 14 sites (totalling approximately 5,000 sherds) were of sufficient size to use in the quantitative
chronologie study.
The Sabine Lake sequence of ceramic paste categories is compared and
correlated with the Lower Mississippi Valley Red River chronology by
means of the Lower Mississippi Valley type ceramics that occurred in the
Sabine Lake area collections. It is seen that although the two sequences can
be aligned, the cultural dynamics of the coastal area are masked by the
use of a stylistic classification in Louisiana on the one hand, and the use
of a technological classification in coastal southeast Texas on the other.
We urge that some accommodation be made.
The sequence is also compared and correlated with a rough sequence
for the upper Galveston Bay area. It is seen that a substantial amount of
cultural lag apparently existed between upper Galveston Bay and the Sabine
Lake area, but the nature of the barrier to diffusion of cultural traits remains
unclear at present.

INTRODUCTION
The principal obstacle to progress in investigation of the dispersion
of cultural traits across the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico is the
lack of local culture chronologies between the upper Galveston Bay
area in Texas, and the western margin of the Mississippi River floodplain in Louisiana. An extensive site survey in the Sabine Lake area
of Texas and Louisiana (Fig. 1) was undertaken in an effort to partially remedy this circumstance.
One of the objectives of this survey was to obtain surface collections
with which we hoped to begin development of a ceramic chronology
by means of soIne seriation technique. This has been accomplished
utilizing ceramic paste categories, and since our plans for additional
kinds of analysis to refine the sequence will require substantial
amounts of effort and time, and since no literature presently exists
dealing with the Sabine Lake area, we feel it would be useful to
present an account of our findings to date.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The earliest known archaeological investigation in the Sabine Lake
area was the 1940-41 site survey conducted by G. E. Arnold as part of
a WPA-University of Texas project. This survey, confined to the Texas
portion of the area, located numerous sites in Orange and Jefferson
Counties. Some of these sites are now destroyed or are impossible
to relocate, but others have been revisited and additional surface artifacts have been collected. Arnoldâs collections, now housed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, have been exanained qualitatively, but no detailed analysis has yet been undertaken.
That portion of the Sabine Lake area situated within Louisiana was
surveyed for sites by McIntire (1958). This survey located twelve sites
in western Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes, of which three were
utilized in an extension of the Red River chronology to Southwestern
Louisiana.

More recently, and in connection with this project, Bollich has
surveyed and collected surface material from sites in Orange and
Jefferson Counties, Texas and in Cameron and Caleasieu Parishes,
Louisiana.
Excavations in the area have been limited to testing at the Gaulding
Site (41 JF 27) by members of the Texas Archeological Society in
1965 (Bollich, MS in preparation). Whi!e the Gaulding Site data
has some interesting aspects, it appears that it will not contribute
significantly to the development of a ceramic chronology.
THE SITES
Sites in the area from which collections were utilized in this study
are of two kinds: shell middens, and earth middens. The shell middens
are composed ahnost exclusively of the dam Rangia cuneata and are
situated on natural levees bordering present and former channels of
the Sabine and Neches Rivers, on beaches bordering Sabine Lake,
and on cheniers (stranded shell beaches) bordering the coastline.
Generally these sites do not attain thicknesses greater than 3 feet, and
average about 1.5 feet.
The earth middens which thus far are only known from Jefferson
County, Texas, are apparently devoid of shell food remains. These
sites are situated atop geomorphie features known as pimple mounds.
which are associated in great number with meander belt ridges that
traverse the surface of the late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation.
These ridges, because of their slightly higher elevation, extend southeastward into the coastal marshes and offered drier habitation conditions for people apparently subsisting on a marsh fauna.
AtlTIFACTS
During the Bollieh survey, 5,659 artifacts were recovered. These
include 5,625 potsherds (including 74 that could be identified with
previously defined types), 9 dart points, 19 arrow points, 3 socketed
bone projectile points, 1 elbow pipe fragment, and 2 historic artifacts.
Since the chronology is based upon the ceramics, other types of artifacts are not described in this preliminary report.
Classification of the ceramics was begun by sorting them into the
two descriptive paste categories and the previously defined types that
are described below. The paste categories were then sorted into
groups based on presence or absence of decoration, and on various
vessel form traits. Since our investigations are not yet complete,
detailed artifact descriptions will be presented later.
GROC-TEMPERED PASTE CATEGORY: we are using the term "grog" to

244

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICALSOCIETY

refer to fired clay fragments used as a tempering agent (Shepard,
1963: 9.5). Often these fired clay fragments are seen to be sherds, but
usually they cannot be identified as such. Our original classification of
grog-tempered sherds provided for two sub-categories: grog-tempered
with sandy paste; and grog-tempered with fine paste. The reason for
doing this was because we knew there were Lower Mississippi Valley
decorated ceramics present in the area, and there was no reason to
think that there would not be corresponding plain sherds as well. By
subdividing our paste categories in this manner, we hoped to gain
some insight into the importance of the Lower Mississippi Valley
ceramic technology in the Sabine Lake area. Two difficulties have
caused us to abandon this subdivision, at least for the present. The
first is that we were not able to standardize our criteria sufficiently
well. Although each of us could reproduce his own classification well
enough, we were not able to reproduce the otherâs classification sarisfaetorily. This is one of the inherent limitations in visually estimating
size and percentage of sand grains .
The second difficulty came to light after examining surface collections from coastal sites much closer to the Mississippi River. This
revealed that some of the indigenous Lower Mississippi Valley grogtempered sherds are actually quite sandy (at least from the coastal
area) thus defeating our purpose. It is clear, however, that Lower
Mississippi Valley ceramics are present in some quantity and during
a significant period of time along the coast as far west as the Sabine
Lake area. It is doubtful though, that the Lower Mississippi Valley
ceramics can be confidently differentiated from presumably indigenous
grog-tempered ceramics on the basis of paste characteristics alone.
It may be that the significance of the paste categories needs to be
considered in a different perspective. Let us first review some of the
salient facts of the situation.
1. The significance of sand in sandy paste ceramics is, at best
estimation, uncertain. We incline to the viewpoint, previously stated
by one of us (Aten, 1967: 10-11), that sandy paste ceramics were
made from sands and clays used in their natural associations and that
any selection for grain sizes was based on the natura! associations
available. We are presently unable to prove this viewpoint, but the
fact that many sandy paste sherds are light-colored and contain iron
concretions suggests that this is the ease, since this is also a characteristic of the late Pleistocene sediments in the area. By the same token,
we are unaware of any objective evidence suggesting that the sand
is truly a tempering material (i.e., an intentionally added aplastie).
9,. Sandy paste ceramic traditions have been recognized at a Tche-

CERAMICS--SABINE

LAKE

245

functe time level in Louisiana, and throughout pottery using time in
southeast Texas.
3. Both Aten (1967: 13) and Ambler (1967: 39) have noted the
frequent occurrence of sand and silt in addition to grog particles in
the paste of the proposed grog-tempered types San Jacinto Plain and
San Jacinto Incised from the upper Galveston Bay area. In addition,
Ambler (1967: 40) has noted (and we concur in this observation)
that grog particles are quite rare in some of these sherds.
4. Most workers have for many years acknowledged the similarity
between many of the design styles on Goose Creek Incised in the
upper Galveston Bay area to Coles Creek Period and Plaquemine
Period design styles in Louisiana (e.g., Suhm and Jelks, 1969.: 55).
However, many of the Goose Creek Incised design styles, while still
clearly in the Coles Creek-Plaquemine design tradition, combine
design elements into design styles unreported in the Coles Creek
and Plaquemine Periods. The actual transition or drift between the
two style traditions has never been documented.
Some of these Goose Creek type designs occur in the Sabine Lake
area collections as well. We also have a very few sherds showing
strange combinations of design styles. For instance, we have one sherd
which would be a good example of Harrison Bayou Incised (a Plaquemine Period type) except for the presence of a set of horizontal,
parallel ]ines incised below the cross-hatching. Another sherd has
horizontal, parallel lines incised on the exterior, cross-hatched lines on
a flat lip, and Harrison Bayou type cross-hatching on the interior.
This might be the first evidence of stylistie innovations that ultimately
become part of the inventory of Goose Creek Incised design styles.
The important point, however, is that incised designs probably were
not introduced into the upper Galveston Bay area directly from
Lower Mississippi Valley ceramics.
The possibility is thus presented that the grog-tempered (with
sandy paste) sherds actually represent the interaetion of the two
principal ceramic technologies present in the coastal area. That is,
the makers of sandy paste ceramics (in our view, a technology based
on using unmodified natural clays) were subsequently exposed to the
idea of introducing fired clay hâagments (probably crushed sherds)
into the paste to make "better" pots. Judging from the relative toughness of contemporaneous sandy paste and grog-tempered sherds in
coastal southeast Texas, we would guess that there was no observable
improvement in the pottery as a result of adding grog fragments. At
the same time, it appears that virtually no other Lower Mississippi

246

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICALSOCIETY

Valley ceramic traits directly accompanied the introduction of grogtempering into the upper Galveston Bay area.
In the Sabine Lake area, grog-tempering was of great importance
throughout most, if not all, of ceramic using time. But here grogtempering is accompanied by Lower Mississippi Valley decorated
ceramics. In tlae upper Galveston Bay area, however, such was not
the ease, with the possible exception of some Tehefunete-like ceramics,
but here we are dealing only with the sandy paste ceramic tradition.
It may be that in the absence of a clear technological advantage, and
without the reinforcement of other aspects of Lower Mississippi Valley
ceramic technology, it was not possible for grog-tempering to gain
much popularity.
We realize that many circumstances are left unexplained, but we
feel that the issue of interaction between the makers of the two major
ceramic technological traditions as expressed in grog-tempered (with
sandy paste) ceramics is worth raising.
In any event, we have combined all grog-tempered sherds into a
single group differentiated only by the presence of decoration (i.e.,
straight line incising occasionally combined with punetations, and
red-filming ).
SANDY PASTE CATEGO]:~Y: generally speaking, the morphological characteristics of this category are similar to those described by Aten
(1967: 10), Ambler (1967: 31), and Shafer (1962: 22) for sandy
paste ceramics in the Lower Trinity River area to the west. Attempts
have been made to subdivide sandy paste ceramics on the basis of sand
grain sizes at both Cedar Bayou (Ambler, 1967: fig. 19) and the
Conroe Reservoir (Shafer, 1968: 40). At Conroe Reservoir, no stratigraphic significance for grain sizes could be found (Shafer, personal
communication) and evidence for stratigraphica!ly significant changes
in the proportions of sand sizes at Cedar Bayou seem to us to be probably not significant. Recognizing the difficulties already mentioned in
visually estimating size and percentage of sand grains in sherds, and
recognizing the lack of results from nearby areas, we chose to use
only one paste category for the sandy paste sherds. Late in our
analysis, and while adding some new collections to our seriated
sequence, we noticed an increasing number of sandy paste sherds
containing granule-sized chert grains. Since sites containing such
sherds generally fell early in our sequence, and since it should be
reasonably easy to sort for such an extreme variation in grain size,
our plans for the future call for such an analysis.
Decoration techniques (as opposed to design styles) on sandy
paste ceramics are the same as those on grog-tempered ceramics,

247

CERAMICS--SABINE LAKE

i.e., straight line incising occasionally combined with punctations,
and red-filming. We have not yet investigated changes in incised
design styles through time and between paste categories. The sandy
paste red-filmed sherds are all identical to the proposed type Goose
Creek Red-Filmed (Aten, 1967: 11).
Reasonably good examples of the following pottery types were also
found in the Sabine Lake area collections.
EUROPEAN TmU)ITION: Spanish Olive Jar, early or middle style (Coggin, 1960: 9-12).
ROCKPORT FOCUS: Rockport Black-on-Gray.
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TRADITION:
Hardy Incised, Harrison
Bayou Incised, Cotes Creek Incised, Ponchartrain Check-Stamped,
Churupa (?) Punctated, Troyville Stamped, Marksville or Yokena
Incised, Marksville Stamped, Orleans (?) Punctated, and Tchefunete Plain.
Because of erosion of the surface of some sherds, it was not always
possible to distinguish Marksville Stamped from Troyville Stamped.
For this reason they are combined in Fig. 3.
THE ANALYSIS
If a logical scheme of investigation is to be followed in an area
that is areheologieally unknown, the location of sites through surveying should be followed by an attempt to develop an historical framework which, in our situation, means a ceramic chronology. As was previously mentioned, MeIntire (1958) attempted to extend the Lower
Mississippi Valley chronology to this area. It has been our experience,
however, that diagnostic sherds from the Lower Mississippi Valley
area do not occur in suffieient numbers to serve as chronological
markers in very many sites, or zones within sites. More importantly,
such a scheme does not deal directly with the indigenous ceramics.
Indeed, it seems to us that any seriation scheme which utilizes less
than 1.5 percent of the artifacts recovered is questionable at the very
least. Rather, we have found these Lower Mississippi Valley ceramics
(along with certain other artifacts) to be useful in verifying our
sequence based upon paste categories and in correlating this sequence
with Fordâs Red River chronology (Ford, 1952: fig. 2).
Although we recorded the occurrence of designs and various kinds
of rim and base forms, it seemed clear from the start of our investigation that a sherd sequence based upon differences in proportions of the
paste categories would be most likely and most practical, since only
a relatively small percentage of the indigenous ceramics collected
exhibit decoration or some indication of vessel form. In this situation,

248

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

one is forced to rely primarily on variations in paste characteristics if
statistically reliable sample sizes are desired.
The requirements necessary for a successful seriation have been discussed by Ford (1962: 41) and are itemized below as they apply to
our Sabine Lake area collections.
1. It is essential that a consistent typology be utilized. It is for this
reason that we abandoned the subdivisions of the grog-tempered
paste category that were based upon sand content.
2. The assemblages to be ordered should represent short periods of
occupation. The shallow depth of most of the sites from which collections were made (the average was about 1.5 feet) suggested that this
might be the ease. Further, the lack of variety within the different
classes of ceramic attributes indicated that rates of change might be
rather slow, thus minimizing the effect of surface collections representing somewhat longer periods of occupation.
3. All of the collections are from a fairly restricted area (Fig. 1)
thus minimizing the effect of any spatial variation.
4. The sites from which most collections were made are located
along Holoeene geomorphie features of varying age, suggesting that
the sites and ceramic assemblages would likewise be of varying ages.
This is an obvious requirement for chronological ordering, for if the
sites are all of more or less the same age, the constituents of the
ceramic assemblages should be present in more or less the same
proportions and an ordering would not be possible.
5. In order to obtain reliable percentages, an unse!eeted sample of
suffleient size must be obtained. In other areas, best results have been
obtained with samples containing more than 100 sherds although
smaller samples have been used. Since we had 14 site collections
with more than 100 sherds in each (and totalling 5,071 sherds) we
chose to confine the ordering to these sites for the present.
Since we were attempting an ordering based on only 2 paste groups,
the graphic seriation technique advocated by Ford (1962) seemed
quite adequate for the problem,
The procedure was simple: percentages of the two major paste
categories were plotted graphically on strips of paper and these strips
were then ordered into smooth patterns of increase in one category
and decrease in the other. Based on information from the Addicks sites
(Wheat, 1953: 184) and the Jamison Site (Aten, 1967: fig. 5a), we
assumed that the sandy paste ceramics would have been dominant
early in our sequence and the grog-tempered ceramics dominant later
(Fig. 9,).
The crucial step in the analysis was to test the validity of our

sequence. One means would have been to dig a series of stratigraphie
tests at several sites in the area. Almost all of our sites are shell middens, however, and artifact densities are generally low. It would thus
have been necessary to excavate a large number of test squares which
was entirely beyond our resources.
In our collections we had some 20 kinds of artifacts about which
some estimation could be made of the relative time they would appear
in a cultural assemblage. These generally consisted of projectile points,
Lower Mississippi Valley ceramics, and European artifacts. Our
procedure for testing the sequence of sites based on paste categories
was to graph the occurrence of these 20 kinds of artifacts (subsequently called "diagnostic artifacts" for want of a better term) in the
sites that had been seriated.
The seriated sites were listed on a sheet of rectangular coordinate
paper along the ordinate axis, and the diagnostic artifacts were listed
along the abcissa in the order we would expect them to appear. If
the ordering of the sites was truly a chronological one, the occurrences
of the diagnostic artifacts should fall above a line running more or less
diagonally across the graph from lower left to upper right. Complete
correspondence is not to be expected, particularly in these kinds of
collections but the actual results (Fig. 3) show a remarkable correspondence to the expected results.
As was noted at the beginning of this section, sherds bearing information on vessel form and decoration were relatively few in number,
and in the interest of larger sample sizes, we felt obliged to rely primarily on paste categories in setting up the Sabine Lake sequence.
Having set up the sequence of paste categories and tested its validity,
we then proceeded to examine the distribution of rim forms, base
forms, lip modification styles, and decoration styles through the
ordered sequence of sites. The relative proportion of each trait was
plotted graphically by site on strips of paper. The strips were then
placed in the same order as the paste category seriation. The results of
this approach were practically hi!. For one thing, most traits occurred
in both paste groups and in most sites. For another, no popularity patterns could be recognized.
We do not feel that the paste category seriation is invalidated by
these results. Rather, we feel that these form and decoration traits
must be re-analyzed in a more sophisticated manner. Toward this end,
we are reworking the material for data to be used in a trait association
analysis along the lines of Deetzâs Arikara study (Deetz, 1965). This,
however, will not be fnished for quite some time. In any event, it

would appear that a chronological sequence based upon the patterns
of popularity of sherd paste categories is highly practical, and viable.
CORRELATIONS AND COMPARISONS
The correlation of the Sabine Lake chronology wffh that of the
Lower Mississippi Valley Bed River chronology is clear in its broad
outline and is indicated on Fig. 3. It is necessary to remember, however, that this is a correlation of relative chronologies, and not absolute
chronologies. We have no information at this time to tell us the absolute age of the Sabine Lake Tchefuncte correlative horizon versus the
classic (i.e., Ponchartrain) Tehefunete Period in the Red River chronology, and the same applies to the other correlative horizons. Thus vce
have no idea of the time lag, if any, involved in the diffusion of
ceramics westward along the coastal plain. Indeed, it is not presently
possible to fully evaluate the occasionally heard suggestion that at
least some ceramic traits diffused eastward along the coastal plain,
having been ultimately derived from areas of Meso-Ameriea (e.g.,
Phelps, 1964: 129.).
At the present time, the Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic taxonomy
does not include any sandy paste wares except for the Tchefuncte
Period types Mandeville, OâNeal, and Alexander. Thus we have no
means of quantitatively comparing the sequence of Sabine Lake
ceramics with the sequence in use farther east in southern Louisiana
(Gagliano, 1967: 8). Moreover, the ceramic typology in use in Louisiana is largely based on stylistic considerations, whereas typology in
coastal southeast Texas is largely based on technologiea! considerations. The conclusion is fairly clear that some accommodation needs
to be made. We feel that future work in southern Louisiana should
include a more detailed quantitative consideration of paste categories
and plainwares if the necessary perspectives on cultural dynamics of
the coastal area are to be achieved.
It is also instructive to compare the Sabine Lake chronology with a
ceramic seriation we have compiled (Fig. 5) from surface and excavated material for an area approximately 50 miles to the west. This
area centers around upper Galveston Bay. To facilitate comparison
we have expanded the Sabine Lake paste category seriation to show
the decorated ceramics (Fig. 4).
For the most part, the two chronologies are based on similar ceramics although type names have been applied in the upper Galveston
Bay area. We have introduced three horizon markers to aid in comparing the two sequences. It is important to remember that use of
these markers is not an attempt to establish ceramic periods, but is

recognition of similar cultural events in both the Sabine Lake area
and the upper Galveston Bay area. These events, or horizon markers,
are then used to examine the relative differences in the ceramic assemblages from the two areas. Horizon marker "A" marks the last occurrence of assemblages associated with Tehefuncte cultural traits.
Horizon marker "B" marks the appearance of arrow points in the
upper Galveston Bay sequence and the beginning of the Troyville
correlative horizon in the Sabine Lake sequence. In Louisiana, the
introduction of arrow points is usually considered to mark the beginning of the Troyville Period. Horizon marker "C" marks the appearance of assemblages associated with historic materials.
The most striking difference is that the early part of the upper
Galveston Bay sequence (prior to Horizon marker "B") consists solely
of plain sandy paste ceramics. Plain grog-tempered ceramics (San
Jacinto Plain) appear much later (just after Horizon marker "B")
and with substantially diminished popularity when compared with
the Sabine Lake sequence. The single bar for pre-Goose Creek ceramics at Wallisville (Fig. 4) actually represents three sites and is
based on comments in Ambler (1967: 79). Ambler (personal communication) has subsequently developed a classification for this pottery but it remains unpublished at present.
Other important differences are also apparent. For one thing,
incised ceramics of both paste categories appear in our earliest Sabine
Lake site (prior to Horizon marker "A") and continue with remarkably stable proportions, up to the latest site (later than Horizon
marker "C"). In the upper Galveston Bay sequence, Goose Creek Incised (sandy paste) appears much later (around Horizon marker
"B"), reaches a popularity peak, and then steadily declines through
Horizon marker "C." San Jaeinto Incised (grog-tempered) appears
after Horizon marker "B" and disappears by Horizon marker "C." It
is important to remember, however, that this is only a comparison of
the use of the incising technique on the various paste categories, and
not a comparison of incised design styles.
In the Sabine Lake sequence, sandy paste red-filmed and grogtempered red-filmed sherds apparently have a disjunct distribution
but this is not clear because of the small number of sherds involved.
!n the upper Galveston Bay sequence, red-fihning on a grog-tempered
paste has not yet been discovered. The distribution of Goose Creek
lied-Filmed (sandy paste) shows a distinct similarity to the distribution of the corresponding material in the Sabine Lake sequence.
Another important feature of the upper Galveston Bay sequence
in contrast to the Sabine Lake sequence, is the absence of grog-

256

TEXAS AItCttEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

tempered pottery and the presence of bone-tempered pottery at the
historic site of the Presidio San Agustin de Ahumada (Tunnell and
Ambler, 1967: 90). It seems probable, however, that the assemblage
at this site represents a Spanish occupation rather than an Indian occupation. For this reason, we cannot be sure if it is representative of
the pottery utilized contemporaneously by the Indians.
After comparing these two sequences, the indication is that a substantial amount of cultural lag occurred over a very short distance
(approximately 50 miles). Just what sort of barrier existed to the
diffusion of the grog-temper ceramic technology and to various decoration techniques is not known at this time.
Finally, we should note that the possibility definitely exists that the
Sabine Lake sequence can be extended somewhat farther back in
time, possibly to show a pre-Tchefuncte correlative horizon.
CONCLUSIONS
As was stated in the introduction, this is preliminary report on a
continuing investigation. Results thus far have been the establishment
of a ceramic sequence for the Sabine Lake area of Texas and Louisiana based on sandy, and grog (probably sherd)-tempered paste categories. Comparison of this sequence with the occurrence in the seriated
sites of "diagnostic artifacts" (artifacts whose relative time of first
appearance can be estimated) indicates that the paste category
seriation is viable and extends through tinae from a Tchefuncte correlative horizon to an historic horizon.
Distribution plats of rim forms, base forms, lip modification styles,
and decoration styles do not reveal any simple popularity patterns.
A more sophisticated analysis of trait associations is planned for this
material.
Correlation of the Sabine Lake sequence with the Lower Mississippi
Valley-Red River chronology can be made through identification of
Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic types, but these occur too seldom to
permit construction of a chronology around them alone.
A rough correlation can also be made with the emerging local
chronology for the upper Galveston Bay area to the west. Although
the indigenous ceramics in this area are more or less morphologically
similar to those of the Sabine Lake area, dramatic differences can
be seen in their respective popularity pattenas. The most striking of
these differences is seen in the grog-tempered ceramics. These are
abundant throughout the Sabine Lake sequence but appear much
later in the upper Galveston Bay sequence. Although we cannot
presently evaluate the nature of the barrier resulting in substantial

CERAMICS--SABI2NE

LAKE

cultural lag between the two areas, we are at least alerted to its
presence.

It is quite true that we still have many investigative angles remaining to pursue in the collections we have in hand. Also, many of the
sites along streams are being rapidly eroded and as a result we continue to enlarge our sample. These additional collections and analyses
wil! be reported on in due time and will no doubt require modification, to a greater or lesser degree, of the conclusions reached in this
report. For the present though, we have principally tried to present
a practical tool for the chronological analysis of ceramic assemblages
from the Sabine Lake area, and to attempt to foresee some of the
problems that additional data may pose.

New Perspectives for Physical Anthropology
and Archaeology
Sr-mImY Hu~PmmYs
ABSTRACT
Physical anthropology and archaeology have diverged in their aims from
a common base in anthropology. Today, these two sub-fields must come
closer together in their investigation of man as a biological being and as a
cultural being.

It is the purpose of this paper to present a new approach to the
relationship of physical anthropology and archaeology. The basis of
the approach centers about the idea that man is first a biological
being, and only second is he a creature with culture. The concept is
clearer if we look at the evolution of man. Most people will agree
that there is a physical basis, a biological capacity, for culture which
must have evolved prior to the evolution of culture. This relationship
of biology and culture is present, however, and the import of the
relationship has been hotly debated.
Granting the evolution of a biological capacity for culture, it is
nmch easier to proceed to the second premise, that of biology as a
cultural limitation. As biological beings, no matter how complex our
culture may be, there are certain limits placed on this culture by the
mere fact that we are, after all, human. We still suffer from diseases,
we must still eat, our nutrition must be adequate, and so on.
Within tfiis Â£ramework, the physical anthropologist may take skeletal remains and cultural materials and add another dfinension to the
framework. Historically, this dimension has been lacking. Physical
anthropologists were struggling with a plethora of metrical data,
and the first article of faith for physical anthropology was the acceptance of anthropometry as the basis of its science.
At present, a new trend has been taking root. Meaningless measurements are being either re-evaluated or cast aside for better techniques
(Brothwell, 1968). Genetics, with its dynamic implications, is becoming the most useful tool with which to approach the analysis of our
data, including that of skeletal remains. It emphasizes the analysis
of populations and the changes of populations through time.
Much useful information has come from the application of a genetic
framework to our skeletal populations. The use of epigenetic traits,
those traits which are closely related to direct genetic content, has
opened a new basis for analysis (Anderson, 1963, 1968a; Berry and
Berry, 1967; Berry, 1968). For example, often cranii have accessory
bones in the sutures. These accessory, or Wormian, bones may be

9,60

TEXAS ABCttEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

closely linked to the genetic content. Thus, two populations with high
incidences of the accessory bones may be related. However, this data
is not meaningful by the consideration of one trait alone. Usually many
of these traits are used to compare two populations on the basis of a
profile of these traits. If the profiles are very similar, then the two
populations are said to be genetically similar populations. It is not
safe to say that the two populations may be related on the basis of
one trait, since, for example, brown hair has a high incidence in many
and often unrelated populations.
A more complete listing of epigenetic traits is given in Berry and
Berry (1967), and Anderson (1963).
Ideally, an anttnâopologist may trace a population through time as
Anderson did at the Serpent Mound site. He compared the Mound
and the Pit populations on the basis of 30 anomalies, which he called
true hereditary traits. By use of statistical techniques he was able to
show how the two populations differed from each other and how these
populations changed through time (Anderson, 1968a). This may show
the archaeologist the degree of intermarriage between the two groups
or the isolation of the groups, at least in mating patterns, from other
groups.
Another way to show degree of relationship is to examine diseases
which are hereditary. Brothwell cites a situation in which five females
of one period were found to have a congenitally abnormal femur head.
This hip anomaly suggests genetic relationship, and further evidence
suggests that this is certainly probable. All of these skeletons were in
the same district, and three were in the same cemetery. Two of the
latter occupied adjacent graves (Brothwell, 1965).
Numerous other diseases are hereditary; lists of these may be found
in Dobzhansky ( 1969,, pp. 107-111).
Other diseases, not necessarily hereditary, show the effects of occupation on the skeleton. For instance, a degeneration of the elbow
joint, called atlatl-elbow, or javelin throwerâs elbow, often occurs.
This degeneration is caused by the peeuliar movement aceompanying
a thrust of the object to be hurled. Cultural and skeletal evidence
should both support this diagnosis (Miller, 1960).
Other skeletal adaptations are manifested elsewhere. The Balearie
Islanders used slingshots and the result of this action pulled the
deltoid muscle on the arm so that the bone was roughened in a
distinctive manner at the attachment of this muscle (Wells, 1964:134).
Not only does the examination of disease and skeletal adaptation
tell us something about culture, but equally importantly, it helps
describe the physical world on which the culture rests (Armelagos,

PHYSICAL

ANTI-II~OPOLOGY

261

1969). An analysis of artifacts does not tell us the degree of human
suffering experienced by a people, and neither does a skeletal analysis
tell us how people coped with their physical milieu in terms of their
culture. Archaeology and physical anthropology in combination can
tell us a great deal more about a culture and a people than we can
simply discover relying on one to the exclusion of the other. This is
the new approach which nmst be taken, and must include ethnology
and linguistics, or else our data will become so fragmented as to
become meaningless. Artifacts do not exist without the biological
organisms, i.e., humans, who manufacture them.
Skeptics may well eite past performances on the part of the physical
anthropologists. While volumes of data were produced, they may say
no meaning has emerged from this data in terms of the study of
anthropology. Some physical anthropologists and others are, however, orienting themselves in this new direction. There are articles on
the effect of inadequate nutrition in infaney on mental ability (Eichenwald and Fry, 1969). Armelagos (1969) and Roney (1966) discuss
paleoepidemiology, the study of disease in ancient populations. Bone
cells are being studied to discover disorders of metabolism, infectious
diseases, developmental diseases, and so on (Frost, 1966).
New methods of skeletal analysis are presently available, through
the use of which physical anthropologists could expand their contributions. These include X-ray diffraction, neutron activation analysis,
laminography, fluorescent antibody techniques, and light microscopy.
New knowledge is available in serology, genetics, chemistry, and
physics.
For example, since many of the Southwest Indians kept turkeys,
Sahnonella, a bacteria which may cause an intestinal infection, could
have been transferred from the turkeys and might be present in
nmmmified remains. By new techniques, it is now possible to discover the presence of the infection (Jarcho, 1966).
Although this paper is mainly limited to a discussion of genetics,
diseases, and sl~eletal adaptations, other areas of investigation yield
much necessary information about human biology and culture. Some
of these areas include the study of dentition, demography, skeletal deformations induced by cultural practices, non-hereditary diseases,
biochemistry, K-ray studies, and so on. The use of genetics, diseases,
and adaptation illustrate the central theme of this paper.
Physical anthropologists are presented a challenge to master and
use these new techniques.
With data from all subfields in anthropology, not just archaeology
and physical anthropology, the archaeologist may arrive at an inter-

262

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

disciplinary approach to his data. In essence, the net result of this
interdisciplinary effort will be a unified approaeh to the study of
anthropology. Some intradiseiplinary effort already has been recognized as important with regard to zoologists, geologists, palynologists,
and others.
Although this approach should be beneficial to the anthropologists,
it makes greater demands on both the archaeologist and the physical
anthropologist. It calls for more rigid controls in the excavation of
human skeletal remains, and the dose co-operation of the archaeologist and the physical anthropologist who will correlate their data.
No physical anthropologist should pretend to be an archaeologist, but
both should realize that anthropology is an endeavor to study all
aspects of naan.

Catfish Spines from Archeological Sites in Texas
CHARLES L.

DOUGLAS

ABSTRACT
Areheological reports containing photographs of pectoral spines of catfish,
but identified as mandibles of gar, have led other investigators to perpetuate
the error. Illustrations of pectoral spines and a garâs mandible are presented
to aid in future identifications.

Spines from pectoral fins of catfish are among the less common items
found in archeological sites in western and southwestern Texas. Such
spines have been found, however, in Baker Cave (Douglas, in press),
the San Lorenzo Site (Curtis D. Tunnell, personal communication),
Eagle Cave (Ross, 1965), and Centipede and Damp Caves (Epstein,
1963). Pectoral spines have been considered to be awls, the evidence
for such usage hinging upon the spines showing polishing of the
surfaces.

a channel catfish taken in Town Lake, Austin, Texas. Original length

Unfortunately, pectoral spines have not always been recognized
as such. A pectoral spine of a catfish was identified as being a gar
mandible (Epstein, 1963, Fig. 23 E), an inadvertent error that has
tended to perpetuate itself. Later, Ross (1965: 107) considered a
similar spine as being a "gar jaw-bone." The bone illustrated by Ross
(1965, Fig. 26 H) appears to me to be a pectoral spine having the
proximal, articulating end broken off. Recently I examined pectoral
spines from several other sites; all were assumed by the archeologist
to be mandibles of gar.
Figure i shows the le2t mandible of a spotted gar, Lepisosteus
productus. This fish (F228) was taken in Town Lake, Austin, Texas;
it weighed 2333 grams and was 80 cm. in length.
Figure 2 shows the left pectoral spine of a channel catfish found
in Baker Cave, Val Verde County, Texas. One articulating process
was broken during excavation. The lower illustration in Fig. 2 is of a
spine from the right side of a channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus,

taken in Town Lake. This fish (F234) weighed 1127 grams and was
43 em. in length. Skeletons of the fish mentioned above (F228, F234)
are in the skeletal collection of the Areheological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin.
Mandibles of bony fish are composed of several bones, whereas
pectoral spines are composed of only one bone. The articulation of
a garâs mandible is much simpler than the complex articulations of
a pectoral spine. Pectoral spines of catfish have bony projections
along one or both sides of the long axis, depending upon the species
involved; these projections may be mistaken for teeth, unless the
specimen is examined closely. This feature probably has contributed
to the misidentifieations of this bone and the resultant reports in
the literature.

The writer wishes to express her deep appreciation to Dr. George

invaluable assistance in the preparation of this paper.

INTRODUCTION
Since man does have a brain, he has a tendency to pause and reflect.
One aspect of this reflection is that of speculation about his origin.
Archaeologists may use speculation to build theory, but they must
be able to unearth some evidence of and about the past. Much of our
historic, and still more of our prehistoric, past has been lost due to
careless destruction preparatory to new construction or due to treasure
hunting. For this reason, some legislation is necessary to proteet against
inept and willful demolishment of tangible evidence of previously
existing human communities. This type of legislation falls in the category called antiquity laws.
The purpose of this paper is a delineation of the historical background of this concern; a presentation of federal and state legislation
in the field; and some discussion of the probable effectiveness of the
antiquities codes in the various states.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
A.

CAUSE FOR CONCERN

As primitive man moved up through time his shelter evolved through
time from "lean-toâs" to mud huts to earth lodges to grass dwellings
to stone houses. It is conceivable that he left some remains at each
occupational level or living site that can be interpreted by those with
proper training and the inclination to do so. The "reading" of these
prehistoric and historic "records" has become the main business of
modern archaeology. As a matter of fact, because of their broad
socio-cultural interpretation of the data-some might be called "ethnoarchaeologists."
Now that we have subdued the wilderness and conquered our geographical hâontiers in these United States, we are becoming increasingly concerned about our historic and prehistoric past. The notations
of Lewis and Clark in their expedition of the great West beyond the
Mississippi are considered valuable ethnographic records. The diarylike history-guidebook on "Michilimachinac" by John R. Bailey, a phy-

9,68

TEXAS ARCHEOLOCICAL SOCIETY

sieian, is a valuable ethnographic document and contains some data
that help to explain the "gaps" and the seeming inconsistencies between
the archaeological findings and the historical record in Michigan history books.
Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. President, was the first to excavate
an ancient Indian Village in this country. According to Dr. J. O.
Brew (in Wendorf, 1962), "Not only did he do the digging but he
also published an account of it, thereby setting an example not always
followed by successors. Jeffersonâs Notes on Virginia dated 1782 and
published in Paris in 1784, carries a report of his excavation of a site
in Virginia which inaugurated American Archaeology."
Brew goes on to point out that the 19th century discoveries of
ancient Pompeii, the excavations at Troy and in Egypt, plus the diseoveries of topographic and railroad surveys in western United States
"brought archaeology to the threshold of professional status." The
first professorship was established in 1866 at the Peabody Museum,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the chair was known as the George
Peabody Professor of American Archaeology and Ethnology. "Museums
transformed themselves," continues Professor Brew, "from collectors
âcabinetsâ of natural, unnatural, and so-called scientific curios to presentations of prehistolJc cultures and stories of manâs steps in his development toward his dominant position in the modern world. The whole
field of the history of mankind took on meaning, content, and purpose."
Within the last twenty years a new dimension has come into archaeology with phenomenal consequences. This new dimension is known
as salvage archaeology. Regarding its amazing development Fred
Wendorf (1962:6), one of its pioneer architects, observes:
In the last few years, salvage archaeology has become a major concern to
archaeologists througbout this country, and, indeed, throughout the world.
In many areas industry has come to consider salvage archaeology as a norreal, standard part of its construction projects; it has recognized a legal and
moral obligation to protect our cultural and scientific resources from needless
destruction.

In discussing the genesis of this concern in one of the scientific
journals, Dr. Brew points out the fact that population growth all over
the world has always threatened the preservation of historical and
archaeological items. In other words, we may say that for thousands
of years different civilizations have wrecked the structures of previous
generations to "make way for tomorrow"-to quote a 20th century
radio program. Modern Athens, Ilome, Cairo, Damascus and New York
have all gone through this process. Dr. Brewâs delineation asserts
that "to meet the threat resulting from unprecedented rural and urban

ANTIQUITY LAWS

269

developments of the 20th century, the idea of salvage archaeology
developed .... Since not all old buildings, information or artifacts
can be saved, the idea of salvage archaeology is to survey and record.
. . . This does not impede progress and occasionally an alternative
route for a road or a dam can be found in order to save a threatened
nmnument" ( 1960:294).
The first major prog~âam in salvage archaeology in the United States
took place in Kentucky and Tennessee and adjacent territory in connection with the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority during the
thâst term of the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was
carried on under the direction of Major William S. Webb, then chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Kentucky. Numerous sites were surveyed and excavated before any water
came into the reservoirs.
The most extensive salvage yet undertaken by the United States
govermnent followed World War II. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
and the Corps of Engineers had been authorized to create 108 dams
in the Missouri River Basin with countless other projects to follow. A
group of archaeologists was quick to realize that because "ahnost a!l
of the prehistoric and early historic occupation of the Missouri was on
the banks of the main stream and its tributaries, a large part of our
heritage was scheduled to go under water (Brew, 1962:14). They
organized the Committee for The Recovery of Archaeological Remains
in order to prevent much of our American heritage from literally
"going down the drain." Archaeologists active in the 1945 effort
included Dr. J. O. Brew, Dr. Frederick Johnson, and Dr. Frank H. H.
Roberts of the Bmâeau of American Ethnology in the Smithsonian Institute. The Committee was co-sponsored by the American Council of
Learned Societies, the Society for American Archaeology, and the
American Anthropological Association. The efforts of this dedicated
group of scholars, though inexperienced politically, won support in
Washington. With the assistance of the archaeologists at the Smithsonian and undergirded by the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Historic
Sites Act of 1935, and the guidance of the National Park Servicebrought into being the INTER-AGENCY A~CHAEOLOCY SALVAGE IâI~OCRAM
OF THE UNITED STATES COVERNMENT (Brew, 1947:209-25).

B. TYPES OF SALVAGE ARCHAEOLOGY
The three main types of salvage archaeology are: (I) 1~iver Basin
Salvage, (2) Pipeline Salvage, and (3) Highway Salvage.
Beginning with the Missouri River Basin projects the report of the
number of archaeological, paleontological and historical surveys has
been an impressive record of cooperation between government

9,70

SOCIETY

agencies and the public with scholars and universities in the direction
of primarily epistemologieal goals.
A publication of the Committee for the Recovery of Archaeological
Remains reported on the accomplishments from 1946-1957 in a pamphlet entitled The Inter-Agency Archaeological Salwtge Program After
Twelve Years.
It is interesting to note in summary that:
(a) 9,000 sites were located and recorded, including prehistoric
villages, burial grounds, trails, quarries, fur-trading posts, military forts, pioneer cabins and early frontier settlements.
(b) Surveys were made in 310 reservoirs in 49. states;
(e) Sixty-nine (69) excavations were conducted in 69 reservoir areas
in 31 states; and
(d) Over 4,000,000 specimens were gathered for compiling and
classification.
As demand for off and natural gas increased and tank car transport
proved inadequate to meet the supply needs, a new threat came to our
prehistoric past as engineers perfected methods of moving gas and oil
through pipelines. Thus Pipeline Salvage Archaeology was born.
Arehaeo!ogists are now standard personnel on pipeline projects.
Then in 1956, President Eisenhower inaugurated a 56 billion dollar
road building program. The Society for American Archaeology was
immediately alert to this new danger to American antiquities and set
up within the organization a Highway Salvage Committee under the
leadership of Dr. Fred Wendorf, then director of anthropologiea!
research at the Museum of New Mexico (now as of 1964-Head of
the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University). By
1962, Highway Salvage Archaeology was organized in eleven states.
In eight years, 9.50 new highway routes in the state of New Mexico
alone had been surveyed by archaeologists and seventy-two sites
excavated.
On an international scale, UNESCO of the United Nations Organization established a world committee in 1960 with King Custaf VI of
Sweden, himself an archaeologist, as chairman. In 1961, President Kennedy delivered a strong message to Congress calling for U.S. support
(to be undergirded by funds) and appointed Professor John Wilson
of the University of Chicago as executive of the U.S. Committee to
cooperate with the World Committee under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
Whereas archaeological salvage, properly planned and executed,
neither denies nor impedes progress, it cannot take place without certain prescribed rights of passage. Hence the body of legislation which

ANTIQUITY

LAWS

is known as "antiquities acts"-to be discussed in the remaining sections of this paper.
FEDERAL ANTIQUITIES LEGISLATION
The first antiquities code was not conceived by archaeologists, nor
did its framers have archaeology in mind. Its authors were so farsighted
that the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906 is yet a model in the field.
Not only that, but it proved to be a significant development in the
growth of the national park system; it made possible the quick preservation of great works of nature and portions of the nationâs landscape
that might have been exploited or destroyed as the U.S. frontier
moved westward.
FEDERAL ANTIQUITIES ACT
Public Law-209
34th Congress S. L. 225
June 8, 1906
An Act For the preservation of American antiquities.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States

United States, without the pemaission of the Secretary of the Department of the
Government having jurisdiction over the ]ands on which said antiquities are situated, shall upon conviction, be fined in a sum of not more than five hundred
dollars o1" be imprisoned for a period of not more than ninety days, or shall suffer
both fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.
SEC. 2. That the President of the United States is hereby authorized, in his
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are

States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of
land, the limits oÂ£ which in al! cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected:
Provided, That when such objects are situated upon a tract covered by a bona
fide unperfected claim or held in private âownership the tract, or so much thereof
as may be necessary for the proper care and management of the object, may be
relinquished to the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby
authorized to accept the relinquishment of such tracts in behalf of the Government of the United States.
SEC. 3. That permits for the examination of ruins, the excavation of archaeological sites, and the gathering of objects of antiquity upon the ]ands under their
respective jurisdictions may be granted by the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and War to institutions which they may deem properly qualified to conduct such examination, excavation, or gathering, subject to such rules and regulations as they may prescribe: Provided, That the examinations, excavations and
gatherings are undertaken for the benefit of reputable museums, universities,
colleges, or other recognized scientific or educational institutions, with a view to
increasing the knowledge of such objects, and that the gatherings shall be made
for pem~anent preservation in public museums.

Interior, respectively.

Supplementary legislation has been enacted by the 74th and 86th
Congresses. In 1935 Congress passed Public Law 74-299, known as the
Historic Sites Act which provides for the preservation of sites, buildings, objects and antiquities of national significanee for the "inspiration
and benefit of the people of the United States."
In 1960 Congress enacted Public Law 86-593 "to provide for the
preservation of historical and arehaeologieal data (including relies
and speeimens) which might otherwise be lost as the result of the
construction of a dam."
STATE ANTIQUITIES LEGISLATION
The fourth section of this paper is a digest of existing antiquities
acts and/or preservation programs among the several states. An attempt has been made to indieate the probable effectiveness of the
regulations in each state by grouping the states into categories ranging
from strong antiquities codes to "no provisions."
The categories and the states so classified follow:
A.

C.

NO e1~OVlSlONS--where there is no known attempt at preservation of archaeological remains of historical significance. One
such state:
t~hode Island
Note: No report available on the state of Mississippi.

The succeeding pages will present the synopsis of the regulations
and program highlights for Texas and each of the boundary states.
Texas-Chapter 153; Title 4, Articles 147a and 147b; Chapter 159.;
Chapter 227; Chapter 150; Chapter 193; Chapter 194; and Chapter
195. (See Appendix A for 1969 Proposal)
Chapter 153 and Article 147a are general antiquities laws which
protect areheologieal remains on State-owned and -controlled lands
and on (all?) lands west of the Pecos River in the State. Also declared
to be a misdemeanor is the forging or alteration of article of antiquity
for profit. Within this section (Article !47b), are the law requirements
for nonresidents in obtaining permits to explore or excavate areheological remains on State or private lands. The State legislature has
authorized counties to set up advisory historical commissions, to be
appointed by the county judge; and has allowed cities and eounties to
acquire museums, buildings, sites, and landmarks of archeological
interest (Chapters 159, and 9,27, respectively), and to set up historic
markers or monuments in such areas as of significance to the county
(Chapter 150). Provisions have been enacted which protect the
integrity of the properties declared significant. (Chapters 193 and
194). The Texas State Historical Survey Committee was established to
coordinate the State program designating sites of historical, archeo!ogieal, or paleontological significanee (Chapter 195). The position
of state archeologist, attached to the State Buildings Commission (409
Sam Houston State ONce Building, P.O. Box 19.172, Austin, Texas
78711), was created in 1965, but operating funds are available for
primarily administrative and educational functions. Archeological
research is correlation of survey systems. The University of Texas,
Austin, Texas, has the most extensive site survey reeords; other records
are at Southern Methodist University, Texas Memorial Museum, Panhandle Plains Historical Museum, Centennial Museum, Witte Museum,
and other institutions. Plans have been initiated to combine all the
site survey records.

276

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Arkansas-Act 89. of 1959; Act 59 of 1967
The 1967 act serves as antiquities legislation in regard to making
fieldwork an exclusive right of the designated State institution, and
at the sime time encourages private landowners to abide by the precepts of the legislation, in relation to its protective and investigative
measures. The act of 1959 establishes the State program for archeological research, designating the director of the Coordinating Office of
the University of Arkansas Museum (Fayetteville, Arkansas 79.701) as
the keeper of the statewide survey records.
Louisiana- (no known legislation)
No legislation has been passed on antiquities, though strong efforts
have been made. No position of state archeologist exists; although the
State Museum and Commission of Parks and Recreation cooperate in
antiquities efforts. The State University (Baton t~ouge, Louisiana
70803) serves, fairly successfully, as the clearinghouse for State survey
reeords. Some of the work entailed in the program is with the aid of
amateurs. The site records are filed with the standard trinomial numbering system.
New Mexico--1931 Laws, Chapter 42, page 81; 1953 Laws, Chapter 7,
Article 13.
The Statute of 1953 is the principle State antiquities law. It is this
law which creates the office and position of state archeologist (to be
held without salary), and establishes a State Science Commission for
the purpose of expediting the provisions of the act. Also, the act declares that permits are necessary for all archeologieal investigations on
State lands, and that these are to be granted by the Commissioner of
Public Lands upon reconnnendation from the Science Commission;
collections made under the provisions of the act are to be deposited
in the Museum of New Mexico (Santa Fe, New Mexico 8750i ), unless
otherwise designated by the eonnnission. The Director of Research at
the Museum serves in the capacity of state archeologist. Some State
funds are available for projects, though the Museum, along with "the
University of New Mexico (Albuquerque, New Mexico 97106) and
Eastern New Mexico University, is mainly dependent upon grants and
contracts. The two universities correlate their differing catalog systems
with that of the Museum. The Museumâs records are primarily site
surveys only for work done by that institution.
Oklahoma-Chapter 50, Section 3309; Chapter 139, H.B. No. 1262.
State law requires all persons desirous of investigating archeological
remains on any lands in the State of Oklahoma to hold a permit, for
which a fee of 50 dollars is charged. Fifty percent of all collections
made under such a permit are to be deposited with the Museum of

277

ANTIQUITY LAWS

Science and History of the University of Oklahoma (Norman, Oklahoma 73069). Oklahoma law declares that it is a misdemeanor to
vandalize prehistoric or historic remains on property owned or administered by the Oklahoma Historical Society. The Chairman of the
Department of Anthropology at the University is authorized to issue
lieenses, and he functions as the state archeologist, though no such
official office exists. The University is the clearinghouse for site survey
records, which are numbered in the standard fashion. The Oklahoma
Anthropological Society and the Museum of the Great Plains both
submit their site reports to the Universityâs catalog. No funds are
directly available for research or salvage other than those used by
the Universityâs field training school and moneys obtained via contract
or grant.
CONCLUSIONS
Included in this paper is a copy of the proposed (spring, 1969)
Antiquities Code for the State of Texas (Appendix A). This is a
rather comprehensive piece of legislation and, necessarily so, considering the nature and richness of culture history in Texas territory
and environs even prior to 1492, and in light of the distinctive contribution to human knowledge that might accrue from excavations in
coastal regions and submerged lands.
One observation seems pertinent. Antiquities legislation must be
strong enough to deter ruthless treasure seekers but flexible enough to
keep amateurs not only curious about manâs past but actively participating in its preservation.
The United States government and the many fields of knowledge
and academic disciplines are now pooling their resources into an interdisciplinary program of action to preserve the past that will aid us
in the study of man through time.
This program of historical archaeology gives us some assurance that
in the United States this portion of the record of mankind will not
forever disappear from the face of the earth.

relief to enjoin and restrain violations or threatened violations of this Act, and
venue of such action shall lie either in Travis County, Texas, or in the county
in which or nearest the place where the activity sought to be restrained is alleged
to be taking place.
SECTION 11--Cooperation Between State Agencies
The chief administrative officers of each state agency are authorized and
directed to cooperate and assist the Antiquities Committee and Attorney General
in carrying out the intent of this act. All law enforcement agencies and officers,
state and local, are authorized and directed to assist in enforcing this Act and in
carrying out the intent hereof.
SECTION 12
It shall be unlawful for any person, not being the owner thereof, and without
written consent of the owner, proprietor, leasee or person in charge thereof, to

SECTION 16
The fact that irreparable damage and harm is rapidly being done to the archeological and historical heritage of the State of Texas and its citizens, and that
historical and archeological sites, and treasures on public lands, are without
adequate legal protection and supervision and are being destroyed and damaged
without lawful authority, creates an emergency and imperative public necessity
that the Constitutional Rule requiring bills to be read on three several days in
each house be suspended, and this Rule is hereby suspended, and this Act shall
take effect and be in force from and after the date of its passage, and it is so
enacted.

The Societyâs Summer Field School
Every summer the Texas Areheological Society holds a field
school. Its objeetives are primarily the teaching of proper field techniques for scientific archaeology.

The site is always chosen so that there will be adequate camping
facilities. In i969, the campground permitted opportunities for
relaxation and socializing in the outdoors.

289,

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Besides the teaching of scientific techniques of excavation and the
importance of conservation, there are accumulated important data.
These data are recorded, processed, and prepared for publication.

Information and Contributors
The Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society publishes original papers in the
field of American archeology. Emphasis is placed on Texas and adjoining areas in
the United States and Mexico, but papers on other areas are also acceptable.

Manuscripts should be typed on 8J~ by 11 inch sheets of white paper, and ALL
MATERIAL should be double spaced. Footnotes should be avoided or kept to a
minimum.
Reference to published literature, by author, date, and page or figure number
should be placed within parentheses in the body of the text, with full bibliographic
citations listed at the end. See this issue of the Bulletin for models.
The proportions of full-page illustrations (picture or drawing plus caption)
should be suitable for reduction to the effective Bulletin page size of 4 5/16 x 7
inches. Plates may be printed either horizontally or vertically, but be sure to
allow for the caption to be printed the same direction as the plate. Captions for
illusta-ations should be listed in numerical order and placed behind the list of
references cited.

Each paper must be accompanied by an abstract (one or two paragraphs summarizing the main points of the paper). The abstract should be submitted as the
first part of your paper.
