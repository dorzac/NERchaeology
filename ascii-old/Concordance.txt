CONCORDANCE
to Volumes 1-10 of the

BULLETIN
OF THE

Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society
In the process of preparing Volumes 1-10 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society for republication, the individual articles were reformatted to larger pages with
double-columned text. As a result, although the content is identical to the original volumes, the overall
page length of individual articles has been considerably condensed. Therefore, the pagination of the
original copies does not correspond to the pagination of this reprint. This concordance provides a means
by which to conveniently correlate the page numbers of the two different editions. A reader who wishes
to check an older citation which references the original page numbers will be able to easily find the
corresponding section in the reprinted editions using this table. Naturally, it will be important for any
future scholarly citations to clearly indicate if this reprint is being referenced, rather than the original volumes.
