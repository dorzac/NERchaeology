ABSTRACT
Dallas Water Utilities proposes to stabilize approximately 3000 feet of
shoreline at Faulkner Point along Lake Ray Hubbard in Dallas County,
Texas. The project is located south of the IH 30 crossing on the west side
of the reservoir near recent developments at IH 30 and Chaha Road in
Garland, Texas. The Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of
Engineers requested that a pedestrian survey be conducted along the
shoreline. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted the archaeological survey for
Freese and Nichols, Inc., which is managing the environmental permitting
for Dallas Water Utilities. During the survey, nine shovel tests were
excavated and five shoreline bank profiles were recorded. Despite the
prehistoric sites recorded in the area, no cultural resources were observed
during these investigations. Therefore, AR Consultants, Inc recommends
that the project should be allowed to proceed as planned. However, during
construction if cultural deposits are uncovered work should cease in that
area immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) intends to stabilize approximately 3000 feet of shoreline at
Faulkner Point along Lake Ray Hubbard in Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). The project
is located south of the IH 30 crossing on the west side of the reservoir near recent
developments at IH 30 and Chaha Road in Garland, Texas. The Fort Worth District of the
US Army Corps of Engineers requested that a pedestrian survey be conducted along the
shoreline. DWU contracted with Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI) to conduct the
environmental permitting, who in turn contracted AR Consultants, Inc (ARC) to conduct
the pedestrian survey.
The survey was necessitated because DWU is a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation, and since
waters of the United States will be impacted, the Texas Historical Commission will not
only act as the State Review Agency but also will act as the Section 106 review agency
for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5494 was issued
for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to locate cultural resources
and to make recommendations about how these resources might be impacted by
construction. Relevant federal legislation includes a Section 404 Permit of the Clean
Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No.
11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for
the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology. The results of the investigation
follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations
that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The survey area lies in the Blackland Prairie plant community of North Central Texas,
which is bordered on the west by the Eastern Cross Timbers (Diamond, Riskind, Orzell
1987: Figure 1). In this region, sandy soils support oak and hickory forests while clay
soils support tall grass prairie. The area drains quickly, due to the clay soils promoting
runoff, which causes frequent flooding and deposition of sediment on the floodplain
(Mahler 1972:68-69). Kuchler (1966) classified the prairie as being dominated by
Andropogon-Sipa grasses. A review of the 1920 USDA soil map of Dallas County shows
that before the reservoir was built the study area was situated in level prairie between
Rowlett Creek and an unnamed intermittent tributary. The study area is approximately
2200 feet west of Rowlett Creek and 9000 feet west of the East Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is underlain by Quaternary Fluviatile terrace deposits that are stratified
according to age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The specific soils mapped in the
study area are Altoga silty clay and Houston black clay (Coffee, Hill and Ressel
1980:Sheet 21). The Altoga silty clay is a sloping soil on escarpments of stream terraces
and has a high shrink-swell potential and a topsoil that is typically 4 inches thick (Coffee
et al. 1980:11). The Houston black clay is a well drained upland soil with topsoil that is
typically 38 inches thick (Coffee et al. 1980:27). Both have high erosion rates.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of PaleoIndian points from the surface of sites in the region (Bever and Meltzer 2007).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall and along tributaries
during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
period are typically located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major tributaries
(Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants
continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states, “Indian

hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to
less than half.” Hostilities continued until the State of Texas and ten Native American
tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty provided the impetus for settlement of
several North Central Texas counties.
Dallas County began to see the first Anglo settlers make their way to the prairie lands
during the 1840’s. Anglo settler John Neely Bryan first occupied Dallas County in 1841
on the bluff of the Trinity River. This early settlement attracted other settlers who arrived
to receive land grants or to join established colonies within the area. Many settlers came
through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only 160 families and single
pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). Many of the families that
obtained land through these grants maintained and farmed their land well into the midtwentieth century.
The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the ablebodied men left to fight for the Confederacy. Still, Dallas County continued to grow and
prosper after the war. The primary industries throughout Dallas County were agricultural
until the twentieth century. This industry was replaced by manufacturing soon after the
Great Depression. Defense factories built near Grand Prairie for the development of
goods for World War II attracted those seeking work from rural areas. From the 1940s
onward, Dallas and Tarrant Counties’ many factories continued to turn out a wide variety
of products, including airplanes, helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics.
Along with the increase of manufacturing was a rapid rise in the population of Dallas,
Fort Worth, and the surrounding communities. Between 1950 and 1990, Dallas County
has tripled in population to almost two million residents (Handbook of Texas Online
2010).
Previous Investigations
A review of the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA 2010) shows that numerous
studies have been conducted in the immediate vicinity of the study area. The largest
being that conducted for Forney Reservoir, now Lake Ray Hubbard, by members of the
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) in the early 1960s (Harris and Suhm 1963). This
present study falls within the boundaries of the DAS survey. During the survey, five sites
were recorded within a kilometer of the study area. These sites (DL1, 4, 5, 6 and 8) were
prehistoric sites that they associated with the Wylie Focus, however none contained rings
or pits. These sites ranged from buried midden deposits to lithic scatters. None of the
sites contained diagnostic material and the sites were already heavily eroded at the time
of the survey. It is more likely that they are all temporary campsites that date to the
Archaic. DL1, 4 and 5 are located on a terrace above Rowlett Creek, and are currently
covered by water. DL 6 and 8 are on the north side of Faulkner Point Peninsula and
consisted of lithic scatters. All of these sites had no further work recommended.
Additionally, recent studies done on the Faulkner Point Peninsula have recorded a site
within a kilometer from the study area. A study conducted in 1985 by ARC recorded
DL249, which consisted of a small lithic scatter and also revisited DL6 and confirmed
that the site was completely gone (Skinner 1985). A study was also conducted for
Highway 67 (now IH 30), but no sites were recorded near this study area (TASA 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The study area is located in the uplands above the inundated channel of Rowlett Creek.
Despite the damage to the shoreline caused by erosion and the construction of the
reservoir in addition to historic farming practices in the area, the area had potential for
prehistoric and historic cultural resources.
Previous investigations have shown that prehistoric sites are concentrated along Rowlett
Creek. While all of these are concentrated along the main stem of the creek on terraces,
temporary campsites could be found in this study area. The 1920 USDA Soil Map of
Dallas County shows the study area was approximately 2200 feet west of Rowlett Creek
that is inundated by the lake. Given the relative short distance to permanent water,
possible sites are likely to be temporary hunting camps and would consist of artifact
scatters, as is the case for sites from the surrounding area.
According to the 1900 Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County and the 1920 USDA Soil Map
of Dallas County the area was occupied historically and was continually farmed for over
a century until the reservoir was constructed. Historic sites could exist in the study area
given that both maps show structures nearby, but they were closer to transportations
routes. However with the recent developments on the peninsula, these sites would likely
be limited to isolated artifacts or buried trash middens, and this possibility was
considered very low.
Methodology
The field team walked parallel transects spaced 5 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas where soil was exposed.
Throughout the course of the pedestrian survey, close attention was paid to the eroded
shoreline, which was visually inspected for artifacts that may have been exposed by
erosion. Shovel tests were excavated according to THC guidelines (n.d.) to the bottom of
Holocene deposits and averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests
was inspected visually and broken into smaller pieces in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. Additionally, locations along the shoreline bank were profiled to
supplement the shovel test information. Shovel test and bank profile matrices were
described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to
identify the specific soil colors in each shovel test and profile. Soil profiles were
described following the procedures developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs were
taken using a Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test and bank
profile locations were recorded with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. Shovel tests and bank profiles will be described briefly
within the text and are detailed in Table 1 and 2. Conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The survey area consists of two lines, totaling approximately 3000 feet, which trace the
shoreline of the Faulkner Point Peninsula on the western shore of Lake Ray Hubbard.
The small, bulbous peninsula juts east into the reservoir immediately south of Chaha
Road’s intersection with IH 30. The study area is situated on the eastern side of the
peninsula and is separated by a small outcropping of land that roughly bisects the two
lines. This small outcrop is covered with chest-high cattails near the shoreline, as well as
a few scattered oaks closer to the main body of the peninsula. The remainder of the
survey area is dominated by mowed, maintained expanses of grass that cover the ground
from the shoreline edge back to Lake Hubbard Parkway on the southern line (Figure 2)
and to the Faulkner Point Apartment complex on the northern line. Ground visibility was
extremely poor throughout the survey area, generally between 0 and 30 percent. The
shoreline was heavily eroded, with jagged banks that ranged from 30 cm to 2.1 meters
above the water line. The study area’s clay dominated soil profile was very evident in the
bank’s stratigraphy. Topography in the southern line of the survey area was relatively
level with a slight slope toward the shoreline. This slope however, was markedly more
pronounced in the northern line, with portions of the line falling in areas featuring
between 10 and 15 percent slopes.

Survey Results
A pedestrian survey of the two lines revealed no evidence of cultural materials, due to the
area’s poor ground visibility. However, the reservoir’s eroding banks provided an
excellent ground exposure. As such, the entirety of the two lines was walked and visually
inspected for cultural materials. None were observed, either on the ground surface or
eroding out of the shoreline bank.
Nine shovel tests were excavated in the study area. Five were excavated on the southern
line and four were excavated on the northern line. Subsurface testing began with shovel
test 1 (ST 1), which was excavated at the southern terminus of the southern line. Like all
subsequent shovel tests, ST 1 was excavated within 3 to 5 feet of the shoreline (Figure 3).
ST 1 encountered a soil profile that was similar in each succeeding shovel test on both
lines of the survey. This soil profile consisted of very dark grayish brown loamy clay
topsoil to a depth of 20 cm, which then graded to slightly lighter dark grayish brown clay
to a depth of 45 cm, both of which rested on a light olive brown clay subsoil (Table 1).
The soil profile revealed in the shovel tests was generally reflected in the bank profiles on
the reservoir’s shoreline (Figure 4).

The only deviation from the abovementioned soil profile was encountered in STs 7, 8 and
9, which were excavated in the northern half of the northern line. In ST 7 and 8, the
topsoil is mottled with yellow loamy clay to depths between 55 and 70 cm. In ST 9, a
layer of dime to softball-sized limestone gravel was encountered at 50 cm. This gravel
layer was likewise observed in bank profile 5. These varying soil profiles most likely
reflect disturbance resulting from the banks being built up during reservoir construction
or construction of the Faulkner Point apartment complex. Additionally, subsurface
sprinkler system lines were observed in the bank profile on the northern line, which may
also account to some degree for the disturbed soil profile (Figure 5). No cultural materials
were observed in any of the shovel tests.
Bank profiles along the shoreline were consistent with the shovel tests throughout the
study area. The two distinctive clay topsoils were uniform along the majority of the
shoreline and ranged in thickness between 38 and 50 cm and a clear smooth to wavy
boundary could be seen above the light olive brown subsoil (Table 2). The subsoil was
exposed between 38 and 90 cm along the shoreline. No cultural materials were seen any
of the exposed banks along the shore.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the shoreline contained significant
historic or prehistoric cultural resources. No evidence of prehistoric or historic
occupation was found anywhere on the surface of the study area or buried in the
sediments along the shoreline. The lack of buried prehistoric site deposits is attributed the
study areas upland location and its lower elevation relative to Rowlett Creek compared to
DL6, DL8 and DL249. Historic sites were considered low potential and any evidence of
this occupation was probably removed during the development of the peninsula.
Additionally, historic sites are typically not found in farmed fields.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the survey and absence of cultural materials within the
study area, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted. Dallas Water Utilities should be allowed to stabilize the shoreline along
Faulkner Point at Lake Ray Hubbard. We further recommend that if cultural resources are
uncovered during construction that work should cease in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers
should be notified.
