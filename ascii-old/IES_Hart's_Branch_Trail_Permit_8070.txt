ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the Hart’s Branch Trail Project (CSJ: 0918-46-285), Town of Little Elm, Denton County,
Texas. As the Town of Little Elm is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the
proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In
addition, as the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA)
Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
portions of the project will be subject to the provisions of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. All work conformed to 36 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which
outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT,
respectively.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any archeological sites that
could be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources
for their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The archeological survey was conducted by archeologists Kevin Stone and Thomas
Chapman on 21 and 22 June 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8070. During the
IES survey, no archeological sites were encountered within the 3.97-acre Area of
Potential Effects.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any
archeological sites, other than those documented within this report, are unearthed during
construction, the operators should stop construction activities, and immediately contact
the project environment representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior to
resuming any construction activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE), environmental setting, relevant cultural background, and methodology; followed
by the results of the investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the archeological report to
satisfy the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1: Introduction
As the project consultant for Halff Associates, Inc. and on behalf of the Town of Little Elm, Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) performed an archeological survey to locate any prehistoric or
historic-period archeological sites that could be considered potentially eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) within the
3.97-acre project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE). The trail project will occur along Hart’s
Branch between Walker Lane and Eldorado Parkway within the Town of Little Elm, Denton County,
Texas. The APE is plotted on modern aerial photography and the Little Elm 7.5 Minute Series U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle maps (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

1.2: Area of Potential Effects
The project corridor or APE spans 1.3 miles from Walker Lane to Eldorado Parkway and encompasses a
3.97-acre area. Engineering designs call for the construction of a 12-foot wide concrete pathway that
would include signage, benches, trash receptacles, landscaping, retaining walls, and boardwalks. The trail
would be constructed entirely on private property owned and maintained by various Home Owners’
Associations (HOA). The Town received a Perpetual and Irrevocable License Agreement from two
HOA’s; therefore, there would not be any additional ROW and/or easements required for the project. The
proposed trail would connect to walking trails currently maintained by the HOAs, a trail system north of
Walker Lane, and to sidewalks at Pecan Drive, Woodlake Parkway, Sumac Court, Hickory Court,
Saddlehorn Drive, and Rider Court to increase neighborhood access.
To construct this trail, grading and drainage improvements would be required throughout the APE, as
well as the installation or replacement of eight reinforced-concrete pipe culverts (RCP). Five of the RCP
culverts would be located between Eldorado Parkway and Pecan Drive and the remaining three would be
between Woodlake Parkway and Maple Drive. In addition to the culverts, four pre-cast concrete
boardwalk areas would also be constructed to minimize impacts to wetlands and drainageways near
Eldorado Parkway and Chestnut Drive.
Vertical impacts within the APE would primarily be restricted to the ground’s surface; however, deeper
subsurface disturbances will occur within limited portions of the APE. These deeper subsurface impacts
would occur immediately west of Pecan Drive where a 165-foot retaining wall would be installed
between Station Markers 115+50 and 120+50. Ground disturbance depths associated within the retaining
wall will reach approximately 18-feet below surface.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1: Environmental Setting
Climate
Denton County lies in the north-central part of the state of Texas. Annual rainfall averages between
approximately 35.01 to 42.01 inches. About half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with
July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively
mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and Earl
2008).
Topographic Setting
The USGS Little Elm 7.5’ Quadrangle map illustrated that the APE is located within a gently sloping
upland topographic setting along Hart’s Branch, a tributary to the Elm Fork Trinity River. The APE is
located within a northeast to southwest trending ridge line that separates Cottonwood Branch and Panther
Creek. The APE parallels Hart’s Branch and is dissected by several of its unnamed tributaries (see
Figure 1.2). Hart’s Branch empties into Lewisville Lake approximately 0.75 mile southeast of the APE.
Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion of the Texas Blackland Prairies. The
Blackland Prairies region is characterized by low-relief topography containing “dark, thick, plastic clay
soils” known as Vertisols (Griffith et al. 2007, Hill 1901). Historically, the Northern Blackland Prairies
contained large expanses of tall prairie grasses, but agriculture, ranching, and urban development has
greatly modified this ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) underlies
these soils, and consists of sand, silt, clay, and gravel in various proportions. A portion of the southern
half of the APE is located on the Eagle Ford Formation (Kef), which consists of shale with calcareous
concretions, siltstone, and limestone (McGowen et al. 1991; Scoggins 2004; USGS 2017) (Figure 2.1).
As shown by the Soil Survey of Denton County, Texas, there are four mapped soils within the APE (Table
2.1) (Ford and Pauls 1980). The APE contains clay soils located on hillslopes and stream terraces near
Hart’s Branch. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Figure 2.2) (Web Soil Survey 2017).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1: Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the THC identified that
there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register Properties, historical markers, or
cemeteries located within the APE. One previously conducted archeological survey overlaps the southern
portion of the APE (Figure 3.1). In 1986, the USACE Fort Worth District performed an archeological
survey of the Lewisville Lake shoreline. During this survey, a historic-period archeological site
(41DN394) was recorded within one-mile (~1,600 meters [m]) of the APE and consisted of a concrete
foundation and metal reinforcements. In addition, the TASA database detailed two archeological surveys
have been previously conducted within one-mile of the APE (Table 3.1) (TASA 2017).

3.2: Archeological Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering archeological sites within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Denton County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas - Sherman Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the
NRCS digital soil database for Denton County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the
National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for
Collin County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial
photography.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
Previous surveys in the North-Central Texas region have indicated that the majority of prehistoric sites
are located along major perennial streams or near springs. The PALM for Denton County indicates that
the southern and northern portions of the APE feature a moderate to high potential for containing shallow
and deeply buried deposits within a reasonable context. The remaining portion of the APE features a low
potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials. Although the PALM has identified
a moderate to high potential for deeply buried prehistoric deposits, based on the topographic setting it was
determined that when flood waters are more than a bank full event, flooding would be high velocity and
have low potential for creating deeply buried archeological deposits. While portions of the APE have
been affected by vegetation removal and urban development, it was determined the APE contained a
reasonable context and has retained its moderated to high probability for prehistoric cultural materials.
Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures were
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1918.

The 1918 U.S. Bureau of Soils map for Denton County illustrated three structures were located adjacent
to the southern portion of the APE. These structures were verified in a 1953 aerial photograph, which
depicted a farmstead of multiple buildings located between Hart’s Branch and Eldorado Parkway and
another farmstead consisting of two large buildings and several smaller structures located north of the
creek near present day Willow Court. A 1968 aerial photograph shows that the buildings within the
northern farmstead had been demolished. The southern farmstead was demolished sometime prior to
1995. While these areas may have moderate archeological potential, erosion, modern construction, and
other minor disturbances associated with agricultural land use would have affected the cultural integrity
of any historic-period archeological site located within the proposed APE.
Historical maps indicated that the remaining portion of the APE was void of historic-period resources
prior to 1930. This was visually confirmed through historical aerial photography from 1953 and modern
aerial interpretations. As such, it was determined that the APE contains a low potential for containing
historic-period archeological resources within proximity to those identified through background research.

METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the archeological survey of the Hart’s Branch Trail Project was
conducted on 21 and 22 June 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel tests met the
minimum requirements for field operations stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey
Standards for Texas. Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records
search to determine what archeological sites have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile
radius of the APE. This information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed
ecological, geological, soils data, as well as, historical and recent topographic maps and aerial
photography.

4.1: Survey Methods
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of a single transect scheme, which was implemented across the entire APE. Areas displaying high levels
of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits.
Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in meters or centimeters, unless artifact
diagnostic elements must be presented within Imperial unit measurements.

4.2: Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters below
surface (cmbs) or the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first, unless
otherwise specified. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in
natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using ¼-inch
hardware cloth to test for the presences of buried cultural material. All tests were recorded on maps and
plotted using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas,
for linear projects displaying little to no disturbance, 16 shovel tests should be excavated per mile per
transect. As such, a 1.3-mile project corridor will require 21 shovel tests to be excavated per transect.
However, shovel test numbers varied based on the amount of disturbance, surface exposure, exposed
bedrock or culturally sterile soil, ground visibility, steep slopes present within the APE, or if
archeological site(s) are encountered. All positive shovel tests, archeological features, and other site data
will be geospatially recorded using a Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS unit.

4.3: Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, no archeological sites were encountered within the 3.97-acre APE. Shovel
test unit locations and trench locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1, and a photograph location map and
photographs are located in Appendix A.

5.1: Archeological Survey
Past Ground Disturbances
Historical aerial photography indicates ground-disturbing activities have transpired within the APE since
the mid-20th century that have pertained to land use, transportation development, and residential
development. Aerial photographs illustrate that the majority of the APE and surrounding area was used
for agricultural or ranching purposes as early as 1953. From 1953 to 1968, the banks of Hart’s Branch
were sparsely vegetated with trees or brush. After 1968, secondary growth began to spread along the
creek’s lower terraces. Hart’s Branch has mostly retained its natural course in the southern and central
portions of the APE. The northern end of the APE was channelized prior to 1953. Historical maps and
aerial photographs depict two retention ponds were created between 1962 and 1968 by the damming of
Hart’s Branch. Although the northern and largest pond currently exists and serves the adjacent
neighborhoods, the smaller southern pond was removed prior to 1995.
Between 1995 and 2001, residential neighborhoods were developed north and west of the creek. During
this period, a system of concrete walking paths was installed along Hart’s Branch and the existing
retention pond. Residential development south and east of the APE occurred from 2001 and 2004.
During the construction of a development adjacent to the northeast corner of the APE in 2003 or 2004,
Walker Lane was moved to its current location at approximately 275 feet north of the original road.
Field investigations verified the past disturbances observed through aerial photography and documented
that the majority of the APE has been significantly affected by past ground disturbances that would have
impacted buried cultural deposits.
General Survey Observations
The APE was located within a varied environment that ranged from mixed woods to maintained park
settings. The topography within the APE was primarily very gently sloping and many portions had clear
signs of modification from past pedestrian trail construction and adjacent residential subdivisions.
Overall, the majority of the APE was located within maintained areas that are routinely mowed and had
been previously graded. The few isolated sections of the APE located within a mixed woods setting with
no previous pedestrian trail construction were primarily centered around drainage features that have been
exaggerated by modern stormwater runoff.
The southern approximate 0.30 mile of the APE contained the least disturbed setting and was primarily
comprised of mixed woods with the majority having no previous trail construction. While this portion of
the trail was furthest down the Hart’s Branch watershed, the channel was not well incised, and did not
contain well defined cutbanks or a well-defined floodplain (Appendix A, Photographs 31 through 33).
Due to increased water runoff from the surrounding subdivisions, two low-lying areas had been incised
and routinely exposed to high velocity flood events.
Moving north, the next approximately half-mile, the APE overlaps or is adjacent to an existing pedestrian
concrete trail, or within a modified setting (Appendix A, Photographs 7 through 16). Where the APE
overlaps or is adjacent to an existing trail, the grounds surface, adjacent to the existing trail, varied in
surface visibility from less than 10 percent to 100 percent and was typically nearly level from past
grading. In a few isolated areas where the APE is closest to Hart’s Branch, the grounds surface sloped
down towards the creek’s channel (Appendix A, Photograph 30).

For the next approximate 0.55 mile, the APE was primarily located within a mowed grass setting that was
completely clear of trees and did not follow an existing pedestrian trail (Appendix A, Photographs 1
through 4). Within this portion of the APE there was one approximate 285-foot long section that was
located within a wood setting and contained a drainage feature that has been exacerbated by modern
stormwater runoff from the adjacent subdivision (Appendix A, Photographs 27 and 28).
Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, 16 negative shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (Figure 5.1).
Shovel testing was conducted within portions of the APE that could contain buried cultural deposits and
to verify areas that were perceived to have been previously disturbed. Shovel tests were typically
terminated between 30 to 40 cmbs due to the vertical limits of the proposed APE, observed disturbance,
and the presence of culturally sterile soil.
Shovel testing within the APE revealed that the large sections had been affected by modern disturbance,
which was observed through the presence of a 10 to 30 cm thick cap of very dark grayish brown (10YR
3/2) gravelly silty clay and at times was mottled by dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), contained modern
debris, or fill material. This disturbed layer contained a varying amount of gravel, but typically averaged
approximately 30 percent of the matrix. Within a few shovel tests, a second horizon was encountered.
The lower horizon typically consisted of a dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay that contained very
small angular gravel less than 3 millimeters (mm) in size and was perceived as natural soil that was
culturally sterile. Isolated areas appeared to have been exposed to less subsurface disturbance and
contained a natural soil column. The natural soil column consisted of an approximate 30 cm thick layer
of silty clay loam (10YR 4/2 and 10YR 3/2) that overlaid a more compact silty clay loam (10YR3/2) that
contained small angular gravel less than 3mm in size.
While frequently flooded soils were identified during the background review, shovel testing and cutbank
observations, illustrated that the APE did not contain any potential for deeply buried archeological sites.
Therefore, it was determined that backhoe trenching was not be required. No archeological sites were
encountered during the survey.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, 16 negative shovel tests were excavated within the 3.97 acre APE.
Although it was determined that portions of the APE contained a high potential for shallowly and deeply
buried archeological sites, no sites were encountered.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Hart’s Branch Trail Project be permitted to continue
without the need for further archeological investigations. However, if any archeological sites are
unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction activities immediately in those
areas. The project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with
the THC prior to resuming construction activities.
