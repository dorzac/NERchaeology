Abstract
In June 2009, PBS&J archeologists conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed right
of way for Segment F-2 of the Grand Parkway project in Harris County, Texas, sponsored by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT). TxDOT is proposing the construction of approximately
19 kilometers (12 miles) of four-lane highway in northwestern Harris County, Texas, between State
Highway 249 and Interstate Highway 45. The width of the survey corridor for the preferred alignment is
122 meters (400 feet), which is consistent with the width of the area of potential effect.
Of the total survey corridor, approximately 28.5 hectares (ha) (70.44 acres [ac]) were previously surveyed
by PBS&J archeologists in June 2002. Since the 2002 survey efforts, inconsistencies between the survey
methods and the recommended survey methods in the Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map
(PALM) have been identified. Additionally, realignments have been proposed subsequent to the previous
survey. Thus, the entirety of the project, or approximately 235.45 ha (581.82 ac), require a linear intensive
archeological survey. Due to land access issues, a total of 142 ha (35,164 ac) were surveyed during this
field effort. Once access has been granted for the tracts where access is currently denied, additional
cultural resource surveys will be required. The survey corridor is located on private lands that will be
owned by TxDOT in the future. Therefore, the current effort was undertaken under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5302.
The cultural resource survey was conducted based on guidelines set forth by the Houston PALM on
properties to which access was granted. No cultural resources were encountered during the survey. Due to
the absence of cultural materials within the area surveyed and the moderate amount of disturbance across
portions of the survey corridor caused by road, drainage, and utility construction, as well as some
residential development, PBS&J recommends that construction activities within the surveyed areas be
allowed to proceed without further consultation; however, additional archeological work is needed for
those parcels for which right of entry was not granted.

I. INTRODUCTION
In June 2009, PBS&J archeologists conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the preferred
recommended alignment for Segment F-2 of the Grand Parkway (State Highway [SH] 99) project in
Harris County, Texas, for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). TxDOT is proposing the
construction of approximately 19 kilometers (km) (12 miles) of four-lane highway in northwestern Harris
County, Texas, between SH 249 and Interstate Highway 45 (IH 45). The survey corridor is located on
private lands that will be owned by TxDOT in the future. Therefore, these efforts were undertaken under
Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit No. 5302.
Segment F-2 of the Grand Parkway project is located in northwestern Harris County between SH 249 and
IH 45. From west to east, the project begins at SH 249 and terminates at IH 45 (figures 1 and 2). The
width of the survey corridor for the preferred alignment is 122 meters (m) (400 feet [ft]), which is
consistent with the width of the area of potential effect (APE). The depth of the APE associated with the
road construction will be no more than approximately 23 m (75 ft) below ground surface. The impacts are
based on construction schematics available at the time of permit application and estimated on typical
construction design (Appendix A).
The cultural resource survey was based on guidelines set forth by the Potential Archeological Liability
Mapping of the Houston District (Houston-PALM) (Abbott 2001) as well as property access. Fieldwork
was conducted by Karen Belvin, Sarah Blake, and Ashley Brown under the direction of Crew Chief Phil
Washington, Project Archeologist Phil Bishop, and Principal Investigator Karla Córdova. Dale Norton
acted as Project Coordinator.
Of the total survey corridor, approximately 28.5 hectares (ha) (70.44 acres [ac]) were previously surveyed
by PBS&J archeologists in 2002 (Turner and Jameson 2005). Since the 2002 survey efforts,
inconsistencies between the survey methods utilized in the field and the recommended survey methods in
the Houston-PALM have been identified. Additionally, realignments have been proposed subsequent to
the previous survey. Thus, the entirety of the project, or approximately 235.45 ha (581.82 ac), required a
linear intensive archeological survey. Due to land access issues, a total of 142 ha (351 ac) were surveyed
during this field effort (Figure 2). Once access has been granted for the tracts where access is currently
denied, additional cultural resource surveys will be required. The survey corridor is located on private
lands that will be owned by TxDOT in the future.
The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate cultural resources sites within the survey area, (2)
delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of any located sites, (3) assess the integrity of each site, and
(4) provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential eligibility for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The intention of this
report is to describe and interpret the results of these investigations and to provide recommendations for
cultural resource management.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
PHYSIOGRAPHY
The survey corridor is located in the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province of Texas. This province
ranges in character from a nearly smooth, featureless depositional plain bordered by shallow bays, barrier
islands, and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico, to low, rolling hills extending inland to the Balcones Fault
Zone. The plain rises gradually from sea level to an elevation of approximately 61 m (200 ft) above mean
sea level (amsl) within 80.5 to 161 km (50 to 100 miles) of the coast. Narrow valleys of small streams and
broad valleys of larger streams that drain the region break the generally flat relief of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. At some locations, this topographical pattern is interrupted by the presence of such features as salt
domes and fault scarps. Some scattered salt domes have surface expression in the form of broad mounds
having as much as 30.5 m (100 ft) of relief. Faults are common in the region, but generally have little or
no surface expression (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996).
The landscape within the Segment F-2 survey corridor is characterized as nearly level to gently sloping
with two natural drainage features and numerous man-made catchment basins or ponds. The alignment
parallels two natural drainage features, Spring Creek and Willow Creek, along the southern margin of
both drainages/watersheds. The natural contour of the ground surface slopes coastward and ranges in
elevation from about 39.5 m (130 ft) amsl to about 48.5 m (160 ft) amsl.

GEOLOGY
Based on the 1992 Bureau of Economic Geology map of the geology of Texas, the surface geology of the
survey corridor is underlain by the Willis Formation in the western portions of the survey corridor, and
the Lissie Formation in the eastern portion of the survey corridor. The Lissie Formation is a Pleistoceneaged fluvial and deltaic unit that was deposited in response to several interglacial fluctuations in sea level
(see Aronow 1976). The Lissie Formation generally parallels the present-day coast. Undrained
depressions and pimple mounds are common surface features of the Lissie Formation. These features
have, for the most part, been obliterated within the survey corridor by agricultural and urban landscape
modifications. The Willis Formation is Pliocene in age (Aronow, n.d.). It is fluvial in origin, and has
fewer undrained depressions and pimple mounds than the Lissie Formation at its surface.

SOILS
Examination of the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas (Wheeler 1976) indicates that the survey corridor
crosses six map units. The survey corridor traverses three general soil associations, including ClodineAddicks-Gessner, Wockley-Gessner, and Segno-Hockley associations (Wheeler 1976). Soil map units
identified within the alignment include Gessner loam, Wockley fine sandy loam, Gessner Complex,
Segno fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slope), Segno fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slope), and Hockley

100008903/090119

II. Environmental Setting

fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slope). In general, the soils detailed below have previously been identified
by Abbott (2001) as having a low to low-moderate geoarcheological potential.
Gessner loam is a nearly level soil found in broad depressional areas within lower landscapes, which
average approximately 0 to 1 percent in slope (Wheeler 1976). The surface layer is friable, slightly acidic,
with a dark grayish brown loam followed in depth by a 23-centimeter (cm) (9-inch) layer of thick, friable,
slightly acid, brown loam. Below this layer and down to approximately 46 cm (18 inches) is a similar soil
color but with a more clayey texture. Gessner loam has been evaluated as having low-moderate
geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001).
Gessner Complex is a nearly level soil found in broad irregular areas, generally lower on the landscape
than Wockley soils. These soils are known to exhibit both pimple mounds and depressions. The surface
layer is friable, slightly acidic, with a dark grayish brown loam to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches) followed in
depth by a 23-cm (9-inch) layer of friable, slightly acid, grayish brown loam. Below this layer and down
an additional 46 cm (18 inches) is a similar soil color but with a more clayey texture. Gessner Complex
has been evaluated as having low-moderate geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001).
Wockley fine sandy loam soils consist of nearly level loamy soils found within prairies and forests
(Wheeler 1976). The surface layer is friable, strongly acid, and dark brownish gray down to a depth of
56 cm (22 inches), below which is a layer of strongly acidic, brown, sandy-clay loam with yellow, red, to
brown mottles. Wockley fine sandy loam has been evaluated as having low geoarcheological potential
(Abbott 2001).
Segno fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slope) is a nearly level to gently sloping, loamy soil. The surface
layer is friable and very strongly acidic down to approximately 13 cm (5 inches). The layer below this is a
pale brown fine sandy loam, strongly acid, and friable down to about 20 cm (8 inches). The next layer is
about 30 cm (12 inches) thick and consists of friable, very strongly acidic, pale brown sandy loam. Segno
fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slope) is similar to the Segno fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slopes);
however, it has a more commonly slightly thinner and sandier surface with slightly brighter profile. The
surface is friable, very strongly acidic, and dark grayish brown to about 10 cm (4 inches). Below this is a
pale brown, fine sandy loam with strong acidity to about 18 cm (7 inches), followed by a friable, strongly
acid, yellowish sandy loam to a depth of 58 cm (23 inches). Both of these soils have been evaluated as
having low geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001).
Hockley fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slopes) is a nearly level soil found in forested and cleared areas
along the northern boundaries of the coastal plains. Its surface layer is very friable dark grayish brown
fine sandy loam to approximately 13 cm (5 inches). Below this and down to 46 cm (18 inches) is a friable,
dark grayish brown fine sandy loam with medium acidity. From this point down, a 69-cm (27-inch)-thick
layer consists of friable, yellowish brown sandy loam containing ironstone pebbles. This soil has also
been evaluated as having low geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001).

II. Environmental Setting

CLIMATE AND VEGETATION
The survey corridor lies within the Gulf Prairies vegetation region, a nearly flat plain that extends
approximately 48 to 128 km (30 to 80 miles) inland. The Gulf Prairies are characterized by a nearly level
topography with slow surface drainage. Elevation extends from sea level along the coast up to 61 m
(200 ft amsl). Annual precipitation averages 122 cm (48 inches). Mean annual temperature is typically
70 degrees Fahrenheit (Hatch et al. 1990).
The original vegetation types of the Gulf Prairies included tallgrass prairies and post oak (Quercus
stellata) savannah (Gould 1975). However, the Gulf Prairies experienced extensive conversion to
cropland and improved pasture for livestock grazing throughout the twentieth century, especially with the
advent of affordable mechanized farm equipment after World War II (Lobpries 1994). Late in the
twentieth century, approximately one-third of the Gulf Prairies were cultivated, mainly for rice, sorghum,
com, and improved pasture grasses (Hatch et al. 1990). In recent decades, the Gulf Prairies have
experienced rapidly increasing conversion to suburban and industrial land use. The survey corridor is
typical of the Gulf Prairies region and is characterized by a patchwork of cropland, pastureland, wetlands,
and riparian corridors with limited scattered suburban development. The survey corridor extends through
a portion of the Gulf Prairies that is historically and locally known as the Katy Prairie.
Very little native prairie remains due to urbanization, agricultural activities, and suppression of wildfire
(Eubanks 1994; Smeins 1994). However, scattered isolated native prairie remnants may still be found
within the Katy Prairie and survey corridor. Climax native grasses such as gulf cordgrass (Spartina
spartinae), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), and gulf muhly (Muhlenbergia capillaries) dominate these remnant prairie areas.
Improved pasture grasses such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum),
invaders such as johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and Brazilian
vervain (Verbena braziliensis), and woody species such as eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia),
McCartney rose (Rosa bracteata), and Chinese tallow-tree (Sapium sebiferum) have replaced most of
these native grasses throughout the remainder of the Katy Prairie. Species such as post oak, live oak
(Quercus virginiana), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), elms (Ulmus spp.), and Chinese tallow-tree dominate
isolated woods and wooded riparian areas along Little Cypress Creek and Willow Creek, and various
other artificial or channelized drainages.

WILDLIFE
The survey corridor can be divided into several major wildlife habitat types, which coincide with the
major vegetative communities present within the survey corridor. The major wildlife habitat divisions are
defined as farmland, forest, rangeland, non-forested wetlands, and forested wetlands. The distribution of
habitat types in the survey corridor and the activity patterns of many wildlife species result in some
overlap of faunal communities. Forest-dwelling species may occasionally occur in open areas around
forest stands, and species particular to non-forested habitats may occasionally be found in forested areas.

100008903/090119

II. Environmental Setting

Edge areas, or ecotones, between major habitats are often preferred by wildlife species because of the
diversity of food and cover usually provided by the overlap of vegetative communities.
The survey corridor occurs within the Texan and Austroriparian biotic provinces. The Texan biotic
province is characterized as an ecotonal region of forest and grassland faunal associations. However, most
of the native vegetation has been replaced by cultivated crops, improved pasture grasses, or invasive
brush. Consequently, numerous native wildlife populations have declined. Many habitat species,
including the least shrew (Cryptotis parva), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and northern
bobwhite (Colinus virgianus), have undergone significant reductions in numbers and had their
distributions severely altered, while other more-generalistic species such as the coyote (Canis latrans),
eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) apparently have
increased in number and habitat occupation. Some 49 species of mammals occur (or have historically
occurred) in the Texan province, of which only 8 are grassland species encroaching from the west,
southwest, or north. Two species of land turtles occur in the Texan province. Nine of the 16 lizard species
occurring in the Texan province are eastern forest species, and the remaining 7 are western grassland
affiliates. Of the 39 species of snakes documented by Blair (1950), 27 are eastern forest species and 12
are western. Five salamanders (all Austroriparian) and 18 species of frogs and toads (13 of which are
Austroriparian) occur in the Texan biotic province.
The Austroriparian biotic province is characterized by extensive pine and hardwood forests, swamps,
marshes, and other hydric communities. The range of the Austroriparian biotic province extends from
eastern Texas to the Atlantic coastal plain and as far north as the Dismal Swamp of southeast Virginia
(Dice 1943). The western boundary of the Austroriparian biotic province is the western boundary of the
pine and hardwood forest of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. The ecological associations of the
Austroriparian biotic province extend westward beyond this boundary, in local areas, wherever soil
conditions are favorable. At least 47 mammal species, 29 snake species, 10 lizard species, 2 land turtle
species, 17 anuran species, and 18 urodele species are known to have occurred in the Austroriparian biotic
province in recent times (Blair 1950). No endemic wildlife species occur within the project area.
Vertebrate fauna in the survey corridor is typical of that found over most of the Texan and Austroriparian
biotic provinces.

III. CULTURAL RESOURCES
The survey corridor is located in the Southeast Texas Archeological Region of the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas as delineated by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This region encompasses the
19 counties from the San Bernard and Brazos rivers east to the Sabine River and the state of Louisiana
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Archeological evidence gathered in this region shows a long and
prosperous occupation by a variety of people over time.
The cultural history of the region is generally divided into four primary periods: Paleoindian, Archaic,
Late Prehistoric, and Historic. These divisions are generally believed to reflect changes in subsistence as
reflected by the material remains and settlement patterns of the people occupying this portion of Texas in
prehistoric and historic times.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000–6500 B.C.)
The earliest generally accepted culture of the Americas, the Paleoindian, appears to have extended over
most, if not all, of North America by the end of the Pleistocene epoch. It has been hypothesized that in
Texas the Pleistocene coastline extended as much as 40 km (25 miles) into the present Gulf of Mexico
and that rivers cut deep canyons into sediments deposited during previous periods of glaciation (Aten
1983). With the close of the Pleistocene came a period of climatic warming and a consequent rise in sea
level as surface water was released from glaciers and polar ice. Paleoindian cultural developments in the
Gulf Coastal Plain region, as in most areas of North America, appear to have been intimately related to
these gradual but vast changes in the world climate and local environmental conditions.
Occupation of the Texas Gulf Coast during the terminal Pleistocene is evidenced by the recovery of
several types of well-made, lanceolate, parallel-flaked projectile points such as Scottsbluff, Clovis,
Plainview, Angostura, and possibly San Patrice. The presence of these distinctive projectile point types
along the coastal plain appears to reflect activities that would typically have occurred in areas farther
inland where the environment is characterized by a mixture of deciduous and pine woodlands (Aten
1983). According to Aten (1983), this type of habitat typically supports low-density human populations.
Archeological evidence synthesized by Story (1990) from numerous counties composing the greater Gulf
Coastal Plain in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma supports the suggestion that the Paleoindian
groups probably existed in small nuclear families or bands that migrated widely in pursuit of seasonal
subsistence resources.

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6500 B.C.–A.D. 700)
Cultural developments adapted to widespread environmental change with the onset of the Holocene
epoch. Changes in the world climate caused sea levels to rise, inland prairies to expand, and regional
weather patterns to become more variable (Aten 1983). Generally termed the Archaic, this next period of
cultural development in the New World has been further subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late

100008903/090119

III. Cultural Resources

subperiods based on changes observed in the archeological record that appear to coincide with episodic
shifts in the Holocene climate and environment. It is commonly thought that human lifestyles and
subsistence strategies maintained patterns developed during the previous Paleoindian period, but with
some notable differences.
Aten (1983) suggests that Early Archaic groups, like their Paleoindian predecessors, probably continued
to migrate seasonally in small bands and relied on a generalized projectile point technology to facilitate
their hunting and gathering of a variety of faunal and vegetal foodstuffs. Despite a paucity of intact
Archaic components at sites in the upper Texas Gulf Coast region, it has been observed that Archaic lithic
technologies appear to show an increased diversity of functional types and styles over those associated
with the Paleoindian period. However, the level of craftsmanship and the use of fine exotic materials
appear to have declined. In addition, the greater array of Archaic projectile point styles appears to reflect
a greater degree of regional cultures. Story (1990) surmises that Archaic period human populations may
have become more dense, with individual bands covering less overall territory on their seasonal rounds.
Differentiation between Early, Middle, and Late Archaic culture sites in the upper Texas Gulf Coastal
region, without the benefit of sufficient associated cultural features and artifacts from which strong
chronological dates and sequences can be derived, has been based largely on observation and comparison
of projectile point styles associated with more-intact archeological contexts elsewhere in Texas and North
America. The assumption has been that similar point styles are probably related chronologically despite
sometimes-vast geographical distances. According to this reasoning, Early Archaic point types are usually
considered to include Baird, Bell, Andice, and Wells, whereas Bulverde, Carrollton, and Trinity points are
usually attributed to the Middle Archaic. Based on a relatively greater database for defining the Late
Archaic, point types considered diagnostic of this cultural stage typically include Gary, Kent, Yarbrough,
Ellis, Palmillas, and Refugio (Patterson 1979).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 700–1519)
The Late Prehistoric, or Ceramic period, cultures experienced a relatively static environment. This period
began with the adoption of ceramics and lasted until interaction between European and aboriginal
populations became firmly established. Aten (1983) has divided the Late Prehistoric in the Galveston Bay
area into six chronological periods based on ceramic seriation: Clear Lake, Mayes Island, Turtle Bay,
Round Lake, Old River, and Orcoquisac. In Addicks Reservoir in northern Harris County, Wheat (1953)
identified two Ceramic period components. This division was based on the continued use of Late Archaic
dart point types in the earlier component and the addition of arrow points in the later component. Chipped
stone artifacts from the Late Prehistoric include the continued use of Late Archaic dart point types.
The addition of Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points to the inventory marks the beginning of the Late
Ceramic period. Ceramics of the earlier period may include Goose Creek Plain variety Anahuac, O’Neal
Plain variety Conway, Mandeville Plain, Tchefuncte Plain, Goose Creek variety unspecified, and
Tchefuncte Stamped. In the Late Ceramic period, the ceramic inventory may include San Jacinto Incised

100008903/090119

III. Cultural Resources

and Baytown Plain, varieties Phoenix Lake and San Jacinto (Aten 1983). It should be noted that several
varieties of Goose Creek Plain as well as Goose Creek Incised (and Red-Filmed) and the occurrence of
bone tempering span much of the Ceramic period.

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1519–PRESENT)
Regional Native America
When Europeans arrived on the northern Texas coast, they encountered two major native groups, the
Atakapa and the Karankawa Indians, who occupied separate territories divided in the area of the western
shore of Galveston Bay. The Atakapa, speaking a language of the Tunican family, displayed traits closely
related to the natives of southwestern Louisiana. The Karankawa groups spoke a language of the
Coahuiltecan family and were more closely related to the Indians farther south in Texas and Mexico.
In spite of differences in language and apparent cultural derivation, the Atakapa and Karankawa
maintained similar cultural patterns (Newcomb 1983). Both groups were nomadic, although the Atakapa
maintained semipermanent winter villages in the interior. The Atakapa subsisted on shellfish, fish, birds’
eggs, wild plants, deer, and bear, while the Karankawa ate shellfish, turtles, marine and land plants,
alligator, deer, bison, bear, and peccary. Conical huts and skin tents served as shelter for the Atakapa,
while the Karankawa lived in portable windbreak-style huts. Atakapan technology included pottery, bows
and arrows, dugout canoes, basketry, traps, manos and metates, drums and flutes, wooden bowls and
utensils, and grass fiber textiles. The Karankawa also used pottery and the bow and arrow, along with
dugout canoes propelled by poles, basketry, cane weirs, milling stones, drums and whistles, tambourines,
lances, clubs, axes, and bone tools. Both groups buried their dead in mounds and left refuse middens,
primarily composed of shell. Both wore breechcloths and skirts and decorated themselves with tattoos.
Both groups were equally unprepared to protect themselves and their cultural traditions from European
contact. By the late eighteenth century, both the Atakapa and Karankawa peoples were in serious decline
(Newcomb 1983).

European Contact and Anglo-American Settlement
Spanish explorers Piñeda (1519) and de Vaca (1528) accomplished initial exploration of the Gulf of
Mexico and the American Southwest. The Spanish Crown, in its quest to observe and record the character
and economic potential of the territory and its people, sanctioned both explorers. This activity by Spain
occurred within the context of greater colonial expansionist efforts undertaken by the primary Western
European powers throughout the sixteenth century. Following Piñeda’s initial maritime effort to map the
Gulf Coast, the earliest exploration of the Texas Gulf Coast territory was accomplished by Alvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked in 1528 along with other members of an expedition in the Gulf of
Mexico led by Pánfilo de Narváez (Weddle 1985).
Much historical speculation has occurred concerning whether the island of Malhado, upon which de
Vaca’s party was shipwrecked, is the current Galveston Island or nearby San Luis Island. In either case,
100008903/090119

13

III. Cultural Resources

he lived among the Indians for the next several years and probably visited much of Galveston Island and
the surrounding region during the Indians’ seasonal rounds before he decided to make his way toward
Panuco in Mexico and eventually back to Spain (Story 1990). De Vaca’s recollections of his adventures
along the Texas Gulf Coast and in the American Southwest were published years later after his return to
Spain.
De Vaca’s account served, in turn, as the basis upon which Hernando De Soto (1539) and Luis de
Moscoso (1542) conducted subsequent explorations of the region. However, by 1561, Spain was facing
increasing difficulties in maintaining its few colonies in Florida. The relatively poor economic prospects
for these colonies and increasing competition from other colonial powers quelled the Spanish Crown’s
interest in colonizing their Florida territories. As a result, the Texas Gulf Coast remained relatively
uninhabited by Europeans for the next two centuries until the threat of increased French exploration in the
territory stimulated the Spanish government to establish more-permanent settlements in the area (Weddle
1991). In 1685, René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort St. Louis along the Gulf Coast
southwest of the survey corridor (Tunnell and Ambler 1967). Plagued by disease, starvation, and Indian
attacks, the end came for Fort St. Louis in late 1688 or early 1689.
In 1722, the Spanish established the mission of Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (also called
La Bahía del Espíritu Santo) near the ruins of La Salle’s Fort St. Louis in an attempt to Christianize the
indigenous people. The mission was later moved to a site near the Guadalupe River, and in 1754 it was
again moved, this time to Goliad. It was during this time that the Franciscan missionaries laid the
foundation for the livestock industry of Texas. The missionaries’ stock formed the nucleus from which
vast herds of wild cattle and mustangs later developed in Texas (Roell 2009).
Whereas Piñeda, de Vaca, and others developed maps of the greater Gulf Coast in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Bénard de la Harpe (1721) completed the earliest detailed map of Galveston Bay
during an eighteenth-century expedition. De la Harpe was seeking to reestablish La Salle’s former trading
post and fortress on Matagorda Bay.
Spain’s defense of the region, then called Nuevo Santander, was to be achieved by establishing a series of
missions and associated presidios for their protection across western, central, and eastern Texas. Mission
Nuestra Señora de la Luz and its companion Presidio San Augustín de Ahumada composed the Spanish
ecclesiastical outposts in the Galveston Bay area. This mission, also known as Mission Orcoquisac after a
principal Indian village, was founded in about 1756. This mission met with considerable resistance from
the local tribes in the area and was ordered to relocate several times before the mission and its presidio
were abandoned in 1771 and officially discontinued in 1772 (Roell 2009).
With the United States’s purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, the long-running
dispute over control of Texas shifted to include Spain and the United States, both of which claimed land
extending between the Rio Grande and Neches River. Increasing dissent against Spain’s imperial control
over New Spain gave rise to a series of revolutionary movements seeking to establish new independent

100008903/090119

14

III. Cultural Resources

nations in Mexico and Texas. Despite Spain’s efforts at establishing a pair of military outposts just east of
Galveston Bay called Atascosita and Salcedo, to limit foreign intrusions into the area, Mexican and Texan
revolutionaries displaced the Spanish at Salcedo in 1811 and the Gutierrez-McGee expedition effectively
took control of the Trinity River vicinity east of the survey corridor in the following year (Richner and
Bagot 1978).
Until 1821, when Mexico won its independence from Spain, the territory of Texas, which then extended
well north and west of the current areas of New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Utah,
remained a frontier of contention between Spain, Mexico, and the United States. Without sufficient
political and military presence on the part of the Mexican government, this controversial region
frequently attracted entrepreneurs and fugitives from Europe and adjacent upper and lower southern states
along the Atlantic coast.
The earliest Anglo-American families arrived in the San Jacinto River basin as participants in a
colonization effort led by Stephen F. Austin, first as a Spanish and later as a Mexican empresario. The
colonists received grants of land in proportion to their family status and time of arrival in the colony.
Some of the early colonists established the New Kentucky settlement along the San Jacinto River
northeast of the survey corridor, hoping to exploit the rich timberlands and shipping trade. Other colonists
chose to settle farther west in this vicinity to farm the open prairie lands along Buffalo Bayou and Bear
Creek.
While many of the region’s early colonists settled on individual farmsteads that were sometimes distant
from other settlers, others settled in less-isolated locales to be near people of the same ethnicity or place
of origin. Some of these locales developed over time into communities and towns that served as cultural,
religious, and educational centers for the surrounding farm families. These early communities were often
located along primary transportation routes through the area, such as the old Atascosita Road. As
settlement in the area increased through the middle and latter nineteenth century, some of the older roads
were abandoned and a network of newer roads and trails were developed.
Early historic settlers in northern and western Harris County subsisted by raising cattle and growing
cotton, corn, and vegetables. Cotton was the principal cash crop through the end of the nineteenth century.
However, severe weather events and gradual depletion of the soil’s fertility prompted the experimental
introduction of rice around the turn of the twentieth century (Hobaugh et al. 1989:367; Lobpries 1994:1).
Although William Eule harvested the first rice crop on record in Texas in 1897 near Katy, the Seito
Saibara family brought Japanese seed rice to the Texas Gulf Coast in 1904 and has been credited with
establishing the Gulf Coast rice industry (Dethloff 2009). By 1909, Texas farmers were planting
96,315 ha (238,000 ac) of rice. With the benefit of mechanized agricultural practices applied after World
War II, rice farmland in Texas peaked in 1954 at 259,808 ha (642,000 ac) (Lobpries 1995:75–77).
The suitability of the survey corridor for rice farming is apparent on the 1918–1920 United States
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, which show the area between present-day US 290 and

100008903/090119

15

III. Cultural Resources

SH 249 as a broad, flat prairie. The clay-rich soil in this area is suitable for both rice farm and ranch
activities. Ranching and farming were often alternated periodically to improve the fertility of the land.
Agricultural irrigation was introduced by William Eule around the turn of the twentieth century in order
to overcome the uncertainties of rainfall in the region (Rylander 2009). The Gertie Rice Farm, located
south of County Road 529 and east of the survey corridor, provides an example of an early rice irrigation
system with a rectilinear grid of canals supplying water to the rice field before it drains into the nearest
creek. Much of the water needed to raise the rice crop was obtained from wells drilled in shallow, waterbearing sand strata. Low berms or levees were also constructed to help retain the water, particularly in the
mid-twentieth century when heavy farming equipment greatly improved the farmer’s ability to reshape
the land.

IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Numerous cultural resource management studies have been conducted in the region, including large-scale
archeological survey, testing, and mitigation. These investigations have been conducted in association
with the construction of Barker and Addicks reservoirs. Aten (1983), Fields et al. (1983), and Stokes
(1985) have presented reviews of previous research along the upper Texas coast. In addition, Moore et al.
(1989) and Patterson (1995) have compiled extensive bibliographies for the archeology of this region.

RECORDS REVIEW
PBS&J conducted a records search to locate recorded cultural resource properties within the proposed
project area and vicinity. The online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the maps and records at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) were consulted for locations of previously recorded
cultural resource sites; locations of properties listed in the NRHP, sites designated as SALs, Official
Texas Historical Markers, and records of previously conducted cultural resource surveys. The Tomball,
Texas, and Spring, Texas, 7.5-minute USGS topographic maps were examined at TARL and on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas.
To identify historic sites that may be eligible for NRHP listing, research was conducted using historical
maps of Harris County, TxDOT’s historic bridges database, local historical literature, and agricultural
publications. Informants and landowners were also contacted in the area. Possible site locations were then
examined in the field from publicly accessible property and roadways to locate potential historic
structures dating to ca. 1959 or earlier.

RESULTS OF RECORDS REVIEW
Known site locations were researched using the official site file records at TARL on May 5, 2009, which
revealed more than 1,000 previously recorded archeological sites in the surrounding Harris County area.
In Harris County, 241 sites are NRHP listed, and 85 are identified as SAL properties. None of the NRHP
or SAL properties are located in the survey corridor. As a result, the official archeological records review
did not identify any previously recorded sites located within the survey corridor. A number of
archeological sites, cemeteries, previous cultural resource surveys, and one SAL are located within
1.6 km (1 mile) of the survey corridor. These are briefly discussed below.
Two historic sites, 41HR968 and 41HR837, have been previously recorded within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the
survey corridor. Site 41HR968 consists of a twentieth-century farmstead discovered in 2003 by GeoMarine Inc., during the Site Assessment for the GSA Project 114 (THC Sites Atlas). The site was
recorded as measuring 120 x 60 m and including a concrete foundation, an artifact scatter, a concrete
water trough, and the remains of a collapsed outbuilding. The site was considered of unknown eligibility
for inclusion on the NRHP. Site 41HR837, a late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century house, was
recorded in 1999 by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., during a survey of a 6,400-ft extension of

100008903/090119

17

IV. Previous Investigations

Gosling Road between Kuykendahl Road and Spring Steubner Road (Beck 1999). The site consisted of a
10-x-15-m structure built in three phases: the southeast quadrant, and possibly earliest construction phase,
rests on cinderblock piers and was constructed of wood; the northeast quadrant rests on cement slab; and
the western half was built out of cinderblocks and mortar. Despite dating, in part, to the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, the site was described as having no research value, and no additional
investigations were recommended.
Site 41MQ197 constitutes the only previously recorded prehistoric site within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the
project area. The site was recorded by PBS&J Houston during the Phase I Survey of the Preferred
Alignment of the Proposed Grand Parkway Segment G project in 2003 (Porter et al. 2005). The
prehistoric site measured 25 x 90 m and included lithic debitage, ceramic fragments, and small pieces of
charcoal. The site was described as having regional significance and scientific research value.
A number of cultural resources surveys have occurred within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the survey corridor. Most
germane to the current undertaking is a previous survey of most of the current survey corridor by
personnel from PBS&J in 2002 (Turner and Jameson 2005). No archeological sites were recorded during
the survey, although misinterpretation of the Houston-PALM data resulted in survey methodologies
inconsistent with the PALM recommendations. Additionally, personnel from PBS&J surveyed the
proposed alignment for Segment G of the Grand Parkway, just east of the current project in 2002 and
2003 (Porter et al. 2005). During this survey, the previously described prehistoric site 41MQ197 was
recorded.
A number of surveys have been undertaken near Willow Creek, including surveys conducted in 1997,
2000, and 2003 by personnel from Moore Archeological, Inc. The first involved an 80-ac tract
approximately 1,100 m north of the current survey corridor, prior to the construction of a proposed
floodwater detention basin (Meyers 1997). No archeological sites were discovered during the survey. This
survey tract abutted the Pillot Cemetery, a SAL, which is located approximately 1,200 m north of the
current survey corridor. In 2000, personnel from Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., surveyed 24 ac
approximately 1,600 m north of the current survey corridor, in conjunction with a Harris County Flood
Control District land acquisition. No sites were recorded as a result of this effort, despite the presence of
pimple mounds on the property (Terneny and Schubert 2000). In 2003, Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., personnel surveyed approximately 139 ac on Willow Creek associated with a Harris County Flood
Control District detention basin (Ensor 2003). This tract is located approximately 1,000 m north of the
current survey corridor. No cultural resources were recorded during this effort. In 1981, survey of The
Woodlands undertaken by Greiner Engineering Services recorded six prehistoric sites along Spring
Creek. The southern boundary of this project area is approximately 1,300 m north of the proposed project
area.
South and east of the project, a number of surveys have been conducted. Three of these were conducted
by personnel from GeoMarine, Inc. near the Hooks Memorial Airport (TARL Sites Atlas). Site 41HR968,
discussed above, was discovered during one of these surveys. All three of these surveys include areas in
100008903/090119

18

IV. Previous Investigations

or adjacent to the current study corridor. Personnel from Moore Archeological Consulting surveyed two
planned road improvements/extensions near the project area. One was for the extension of Gosling Road,
in which 41HR837 was recorded (Beck 1999) and the other proposed improvements to Kuykendahl Road,
in which no cultural resources were recorded (Ferguson and Hall 2005). Other surveys in the vicinity
have been conducted principally by personnel from the Texas Highway Department and Corp of
Engineers over the years.

100008903/090119

19

V. FIELD METHODOLOGY
The investigations included a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the portions of the survey corridor for
which right of entry was granted, augmented with shovel testing in designated areas recommended by the
Houston-PALM. The primary criteria used in developing the PALM included landform types, soil types,
and evidence of recent and historic land use. These mapping criteria are integrated with broad
environmental determinations interpreted from the Geologic Atlas of Texas and field reconnaissance of
the Houston area. Included in these determinations are factors such as upland, coastal, riparian, and
aquatic environments.
Based on the results of Abbott’s (2001) work, PBS&J developed a matrix of mapping criteria in
consultation with the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer. These criteria were utilized to map the
geoarcheological potential within the Houston Highway District. Based on the research design
recommendations set forth in the Houston-PALM, the high probability areas (HPAs) are represented in
map units 1, 2, 2a, 3, and 3a (see Figure 2). These map units are defined as follows:
•

Unit 0 – Waterbodies; no survey recommended.

•

Unit 1 – Surface survey recommended; deep reconnaissance recommended if deep impacts are
anticipated.

•

Unit 2 – Surface survey recommended; no deep reconnaissance recommended.

•

Unit 2a – Surface survey of mounds only; no deep reconnaissance recommended.

•

Unit 3 – No surface survey recommended; deep reconnaissance recommended if deep impacts are
anticipated.

•

Unit 3a – No surface survey recommended; deep reconnaissance recommended if severe deep
impacts are anticipated.

•

Unit 4 – No survey recommended.

All property owners within the areas recommended for survey were contacted by letter and by a follow-up
telephone call. In the areas recommended for survey by the PALM that were not surveyed, access was
denied or the landowner never responded to our requests for access. The total area and survey status of
map Unit 1 of the PALM occurred only at the Little Cypress Creek crossing, but we did not have access
to that area. Because deep impacts are anticipated near Little Cypress Creek, trenching will be necessary
in this area once access has been granted. During survey of the areas where we were granted access, only
map Unit 2 was subjected to shovel testing and surface inspection, while map Unit 2a was only surface
inspected for cultural resources consistent with the PALM recommendations (see Figure 2).
Where access was granted, the survey was conducted in four parallel pedestrian transects spaced at
approximate 30-m (98-ft) intervals across the width of the 122-m (400-ft) alignment corridor. In cases
where the full width of the survey corridor was inaccessible due to right of entry issues or was disturbed
by man-made landforms such as roads or levees, transects were eliminated from the interval. Shovel tests
100008903/090119

20

V. Field Methodology

were placed at 30-m (98-ft) intervals where shovel testing was recommended by the Houston-PALM.
Each shovel test was excavated to a diameter of approximately 30 cm (12 inches) and depths of arbitrary
10-cm (4-inch) levels. Excavated soils from were screened using 0.64-millimeter (¼-inch) hardware
cloth. Dense soils dominated by clay were divided with hand tools and separated for inspection. In areas
heavily disturbed by agriculture, soils were excavated to clayey horizons and terminated.

100008903/090119

21

VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS OF AREAS
SURVEYED AND ASSESSED
The archeological survey included a 100 percent pedestrian survey within the survey corridor where
access was granted. This pedestrian survey was augmented with shovel testing where recommended by
the PALM (see Figure 2 for PALM units and shovel test locations). Much of the survey corridor and
surrounding area is currently wooded to some degree (Appendix). In the western portion of the survey
corridor, most of the areas surveyed were covered in dense yaupon and other low growth. To the east,
secondary pine growth became more common. Throughout the survey corridor, disturbances resulting
from logging, excavation of stock tanks, clearing for the development of subdivisions, and other activities
are evident. In general, dense leaf litter kept the surface visibility low (0–10 percent) across the survey
corridor, except in small areas that had been recently disturbed, such as logging roads. Low-lying
wetlands were more common in the eastern portion of the survey corridor.
Of the approximately 235.45 ha (581.82 ac) requiring intensive archeological survey, access was granted
to and survey was undertaken on 142 hectares (351 ac). A total of 161 shovel tests were excavated
throughout portions of the survey corridor where shovel testing was recommended by the PALM model,
typically terminating prior to 60 cm below surface. These shovel tests typically encountered sandy loams
underlain by sandy clays or clay loams. Shovel tests in obviously disturbed soils, such as those on berms
or along man-made drainages, were attempted although typically terminated at a shallow depth. No
cultural materials were found within the areas surveyed.

100008903/090119

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
PBS&J archeologists did not encounter any cultural resources during the intensive survey of the proposed
Segment F-2 of the Grand Parkway project in Harris County, Texas. The lack of archeological materials
recorded may be due, in part, to the proposed project’s location on upland areas situated approximately
800 m from reliable sources of water. The soils throughout the corridor have low to low-moderate
geoarcheological potential. The combination of soil types is generally poor for site preservation, and
modern disturbances from agricultural practices and urban expansion may have destroyed much of the
archeological record in the survey corridor. Due to the absence of cultural materials within the areas
surveyed and moderate disturbance across portions of the survey corridor caused by road, drainage, and
utility construction, as well as some residential development, PBS&J recommends that construction
activities within the areas surveyed be allowed to proceed without further consultation. However,
additional archeological work is needed for those parcels for which right of entry was not granted as
depicted in Figure 2.
