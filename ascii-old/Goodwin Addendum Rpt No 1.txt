Addendum Report #1 – June 2009

Abstract
Between June and December 2007, R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc., performed
additional Phase I cultural resources surveys and archeological inventories of the proposed 42-inch
outside diameter (O.D.) Gulf Crossing Project in Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Delta, Hopkins,
Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass counties, Texas. The amount of land assessed during the current
Phase I cultural resources inventory study totaled 326.3 ha (806.6 ac). This entailed 217.0 ha
(536.3 ac) of newly surveyed pipeline routes and extra workspaces, 14.2 ha (5.1 ac) assessed with
54 access roads, and 77.0 ha (190.2 ac) which encompassed six contractor yards. Approximately
1.9 km (1.2 mi) of the preferred pipeline right-of-way and 11 access roads that measure 11.3 km
(18.2 km) in length could not be examined due to landowners denying permission to enter their
property. These areas will require additional Phase I cultural resources surveys.
A total of six cultural resources were identified or relocated as a result of these supplemental field
investigations. Newly recorded Site 41FK128 was classified as a prehistoric (likely Early to
Middle Caddo Period) artifact scatter. Due to the types of material recovered as well as its
stratigraphic context, the site was assessed as potentially eligible, applying the National Register
of Historic Places criterion of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). Gulf Crossing has designed a new
route alignment that will avoid all impacts to the site. The installation of safety fencing along its
closest boundary also is recommended. Monitoring during construction may be required to ensure
that adverse effects do not occur to Site 41FK128.
This field effort also relocated Site 41TT30. While the entirety of Site 41TT30 could not be
evaluated due to land owners restricting survey to a 106.7 m (350 ft) wide corridor, the portion of
the site that lies within the proposed Gulf Crossing Areas of Potential Effects consists of a sparse
scattering of prehistoric artifacts. This portion of the site does not possess the qualities of
significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]).
Nearby Isolated Find 108.49-01 only produced two prehistoric ceramic sherds that originated
from subsurface contexts. This cultural resource doe not possess the qualities of significance as
defined by the aforementioned National Register of Historic Places criteria (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]).
Only two historic structures were identified within the preferred Gulf Crossing corridor. HSS080907a-01, located in Morris County, consists of a collapsed log structure that appears to have
been a barn or some other type of agricultural outbuilding. It was identified within an overgrown
area near the southern edge of the Gulf Crossing environmental survey corridor. HSS-145.81-01
in Cass County consists of a collapsed vernacular bungalow associated with a small deteriorated
shed. Both structures HSS-080907a-01 and HSS-145.81-01 appear to date from the twentieth
century. Pedestrian survey and shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of these two structures failed
to identify any cultural materials or evidence of intact cultural deposits associated with either
structure. Neither structure retains integrity nor the qualities of significance as defined by the
National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No further
recordation of structures HSS-080907a-01 and HSS-145.81-01 is recommended.
In addition, a rather well-defined historic cemetery was identified immediately outside the
southwestern boundary of proposed contractor yard TX-CY-05 in Titus County, Texas. To ensure
that this cemetery is not damaged inadvertently during construction, several safety precautions
are recommended, including fencing and monitoring during construction.

Gulf Crossing Project
Addendum Report #1 – June 2009

Introduction
This report presents the results of supplemental Phase I cultural resources investigations conducted by R.
Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. from June to December, 2007. The proposed Gulf Crossing
Project currently is undergoing review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under
Docket CP07-398-000. The examined areas described here expand upon the Phase I cultural resources
surveys performed during the first half of 2007 and reported to the State Historic Preservation Office
(Texas Historical Commission) and the FERC (Lackowicz et al. 2007). The Gulf Crossing Project
measures approximately 568.4 km (374.1 mi) in length and will require the installation of a 42-inch O.D.
natural gas pipeline that crosses multiple counties and parishes in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and
Mississippi; approximately 175.1 km (108.8 mi) of the project length is located in northeastern Texas
(Figure 1).
Land access recently was obtained by Gulf Crossing for several properties that could not be surveyed
during the initial Phase I investigation. In addition, several new access roads, route alterations and
appurtenant project facilities also were examined. This document presents the results of these
supplemental field investigations. This supplemental report will be included as an appendix to the final
Phase I Gulf Crossing report that will be submitted to your office at the conclusion of the Gulf Crossing
cultural resources investigations.
A total of 326.3 ha (806.6 ac) was assessed as a result of this undertaking. This consisted of 217.0 ha
(536.3 ac) of survey corridor and extra workspaces, 14.2 ha (5.1 ac) distributed along 54 access roads and
77.0 ha (190.2 ac) assessed with six contractor yards. Approximately 1.9 km (1.2 mi) of the preferred
pipeline right-of-way remains to be examined due to landowners denying survey permission to enter the
property.
A summary of the field methods utilized to complete this investigation, as well as a description of the
survey items and identified cultural resources, is presented below. Information pertaining to the natural,
prehistoric, and historic settings of the project region, as well as a review of the previous archeological
investigations completed in the general vicinity of these project items, is contained in the previously
submitted and reviewed cultural resources survey report (Lackowicz et al. 2008).
Field Investigation Methodology
The fieldwork associated with this undertaking consisted of a Phase I cultural resources survey and
archeological inventory designed to identify all prehistoric and historic period cultural resources located
within the Areas of Potential Effect. The methods used to complete this investigation provided for
complete and thorough coverage of all portions of the proposed project item. Since the survey
methodology associated with the proposed Gulf Crossing Pipeline Project has been discussed at length in
the above-referenced document (Lackowicz et al. 2008), only a brief review of these methods is provided
below.
While Gulf Crossing generally will utilize a 30.5 m (100 ft) wide construction right-of-way in the upland
areas and a 22.9 m (75 ft) wide construction right-of-way through the wetlands, a survey corridor
measuring between 91.4 and 106.7 m (300 to 350 ft) in width was examined for cultural resources. The
width of the examined corridor depended on whether the pipeline was collocated with an existing utility
right-of-way or if required totally new (greenfield) rights-of-way. The additional survey coverage should
encompass any extra workspaces that may be required during construction, and it will enable Gulf
Crossing to make minor changes to the proposed pipeline centerline configuration, without the need for
additional Phase I cultural resources investigation.

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
Each examined portion of the preferred route alignment, pipeline alternative route, access road and
appurtenant facility was inspected for cultural material and/or evidence of intact cultural deposits. As
noted in the primary document (Lackowicz et al. 2008), all shovel tests excavated as a result of this Phase
I investigation measured at least 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and each was excavated into the underlying
subsoil. In areas where pre-Holocene sediments could not be established firmly by visual means, shovel
tests were excavated to a minimum depth of 50 cmbs (19.7 inbs). In addition, field crews were instructed,
where feasible, to excavate at least two levels (20 cm [7.9 in]) below the last artifact producing deposit.
Shovel tests were not excavated in areas characterized by extreme slope, where surface visibility
exceeded 40 percent, in areas of extensive land disturbance, or in areas covered by standing water, such as
lakes, rivers or marshes. Except for the latter areas, each of the proposed project items was investigated
through pedestrian reconnaissance along survey transects spaced no more than 30 m (98.4 ft) apart.
The Phase I cultural resources survey utilized a number of methods that provided for consistency, quality
control, and for the precise location recordation of all cultural resources located during survey. The
fieldwork included surface reconnaissance along the entire length and width of the proposed right-of-way
corridor, and this was augmented by the systematic excavation of shovel tests in those areas characterized by
poor surface visibility. Transect survey was utilized to assure complete coverage of the proposed survey
corridor and to control the subsequent delineation and recordation of all archeological sites or loci identified
during survey. Agricultural and other modern developments across the landscape can destroy the
surface/near surface levels of the soil pedon. In areas of disturbance such as agricultural fields, where ground
surface visibility was greater than 40 percent, fieldwork was limited to pedestrian survey. In these areas,
fieldwork was conducted along survey transects spaced 25 to 30 m (82 to 98.4 ft) apart (Figures 2 and 3).
The spacing between transects was reduced to 10 - 15 m (32.8 to 49.2 ft) at locations where the surface
visibility partially was obscured, such as along raised corn rows in agricultural fields. Existing cleared
pipeline and transmission line corridors that fell within or directly adjacent to the examined survey corridor
also were subjected to pedestrian survey, since these areas had been impacted previously by repeated tree
harvesting and ground clearing activities.
The surveyed corridor measured 91.5 to 106.7 m (300 to 350 ft) wide, depending on whether the
assessment corridor was situated adjacent to an existing pipeline right-of-way (91.5 m / 300 ft) or it fell
within an area that would require the use of entirely new rights-of-way (106.7 m / 350 ft). Shovel tests
spaced 100 m (328 ft) apart were systematically excavated within the corridor when ground surface
visibility averaged less than 40 percent and where the field supervisor assessed the landform as having
low archeological site potential. If extensive land disturbance was not present, two parallel linear transects
spaced 50 m (164 ft) apart were used as shown in Figures 2 and 3.
In areas characterized by poor surface visibility, but the area was perceived to have high archeological site
potential, then shovel tests were excavated at 50 m (164 ft) intervals along each survey transect. Shovel tests
excavated along adjacent transects were offset to maximize coverage throughout the Areas of Potential
Effects. As an additional measure, the shovel testing interval was reduced further to 25 m (82 ft) when
relocating the plotted position of a known cultural resource. The reduced interval was initiated when
approaching within 100 m (328 ft) of the outer site boundary and extended through the site at least 100 m (328
ft) past its plotted endpoint.
At locations where the proposed pipeline crossed over to the opposite side of an existing cleared right-of-way,
the same transect configuration was used. At these crossovers, however, the survey corridor encompassed
both sides of the existing right-of-way and it extended in length to the degree necessary to provide full
coverage of the Areas of Potential Effect.

Gulf Crossing Project
Addendum Report #1 – June 2009

In addition to the examined survey corridors, survey was performed at a number of ancillary project items
and access roads that will be needed to construct of the proposed Gulf Crossing Project pipeline. Each
proposed meter station and contractor yard was examined using pedestrian survey, augmented by
systematic shovel testing where surface visibility measured lower than 30 percent or where subsurface
deposits were deemed likely due to the types of soils present or the presence of microtopographic features
such as ridge tops or knolls. Unless extreme ground disturbance was noted, shovel tests generally were
excavated in the manner described above for associated pipeline right-of-way. Pedestrian reconnaissance
was conducted along survey transects spaced 15 to 25 m (49.2 to 82 ft) apart in areas where visibility
exceeded 40 percent, and spaced at 50 m (164 ft) intervals in areas that required shovel testing. Shovel
tests were excavated at 50 m (164 ft) intervals in areas characterized by high archeological potential and
at 100 m (328 ft) intervals in areas marked by low archeological potential. As noted above, the shovel
testing interval was reduced further to 25 m (82 ft) in areas that contained known cultural resources. Each
proposed access roads was examined visually along its entire length and width. The roadbed was
examined along parallel survey transects placed to either side of the access road centerline. The survey
corridor for these proposed roadways measured roughly 10 m (32.8 ft) in total width. Shovel testing,
where required due to poor surface visibility or in areas where road-widening or other improvements
might occur, was completed at 50 m (164 ft) intervals with shovel tests excavated in an alternating
fashion along each side of the roadbed.
Architectural Review
Survey crews were instructed to record all historic period standing structures identified during the field
examination of the proposed pipeline segments and it facilities. The purpose of this architectural recordation
was to: (1) collect reconnaissance-level architectural survey data for each building 50 years in age or older
located within or immediately adjacent to the proposed Areas of Potential Effect; (2) apply the National
Register criteria to each recorded resource to identify potential historic properties; and (3) apply the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect to each historic property
to anticipate the potential effects of the undertaking.
The architectural survey encompassed the 91.4 m (300 ft) or 106.7 m (350 ft) wide survey corridor. Since it
was anticipated that potential visual effects might extend beyond the physical impact area, the Area of
Potential Effect for visual effects was refined further by conditions identified in the field; the viewshed
under examination often extended for an additional 50 m (164 ft) to either side of the corridor, depending
upon land access and visibility. Architectural investigations were undertaken in accordance with guidelines
established in National Register Bulletin 24: Guidelines for Local Surveys: A Basis for Preservation
Planning. Where relevant, the information in National Register Bulletin 30: Guidelines for Evaluating and
Documenting Rural Historic Landscapes was also applied to the investigation.
The architectural survey was accomplished by inspecting each building encountered along the proposed
project right-of-way as well as the other items included in the Areas of Potential Effect. Black and white
and/or color photographs (35mm) were taken of all built resources 50 years in age or older. Architectural
data collected included building form, building material(s), and decorative features. Field notes also
recorded the character of the surrounding area, including vegetation present, overall landscape, and the
presence of man-made obstructions.
Curation
After the final report has been accepted, all cultural material first will be offered to the private land owner
from whose property the material was collected. Drawings, maps, photographs, field notes and cultural
material donated by the land owner will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. This
facility is located at the University of Texas at Austin, J.J. Pickle Research Campus, Bldg. 5, 10100
Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758.

Previously Recorded Cultural Resources
Prior to initiating this Phase I cultural resources investigation, a review of the archeological site files was
undertaken. This review utilized records currently online from the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) database housed at the University of Texas in Austin. This research was performed to
ensure that potential impacts to all known historic properties were identified prior to field crews reaching
the area. The following section briefly presents information on the archeological sites that are mapped on the
GIS Texas Site Atlas as lying within, or directly adjacent to, the preferred project corridor, but could not be
relocated as a result of this current field investigation. The re-identification of these sites was a primary
research objective for this investigation; however, no evidence of some of the sites could be relocated
within the Areas of Potential Effects. These descriptions are provided in the unlikely event that cultural
materials are encountered during construction and the Unanticipated Discovery Plan is enacted. The precise
locations of these resources are shown in the USGS topographic quadrangle excerpts (Sheets 1 to 55)
contained in the copies of the report that are on file at TARL and the Texas Historical Commission.
Site 41FN42 first was identified during a Phase I cultural resources investigation conducted for the Black
Marlin pipeline project (Price et al. 1990). Artifacts collected from the site included historic stoneware,
whiteware, metal and glass; all were identified scattered across the surface of a plowed field positioned
along a slight ridge. The site was re-identified during our initial investigation through the recovery of a
single fragment of historic ceramic collected from a shovel test excavated in the preferred Gulf Crossing
corridor (Lackowicz et al. 2008). The previously recorded boundaries place Site 41FN42 in conflict with
an existing road that Gulf Crossing is proposing to use to access the pipeline construction corridor (TAR
48.30; Sheet 5). During the current field assessment, no additional cultural material was recovered.
Site 41TT560 is plotted on the Texas Site Atlas as lying within the northern portion of the surveyed
preferred Gulf Crossing corridor (Sheet 34). The site was identified during the 1988 Phase I cultural
resources survey of the Southern Interconnect Pipeline (Peter et al. 1989). At that time, the limits of the
prehistoric period site were calculated as 60 by 50 m (196.9 by 164.0 ft) in extent. Pedestrian survey
coupled with the excavation of three shovel tests throughout the area led to the recovery of two core
fragments, one indeterminate lithic flake, and the base of a possible Late Archaic Period projectile
point/knife; the latter was collected on the surface of the site. Site 41TT560 was assessed as not
significant applying the National Register of Historic Places criteria of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [d]) and
no further work was recommended by Peter et al. (1989). The recorded location of Site 41TT560 was
examined through a combination of pedestrian survey and systematic during both the previous and
current Gulf Crossing field efforts. No evidence that this site actually extends into the project area could
be found.
Site 41TT569 is plotted within the northern portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing survey corridor. It first
was discovered in 1988 during the Southern Interconnect Pipeline survey (Perttula and Nathan 1988;
Peter et al. 1989). The site area, which measured 40 by 60 m (131.2 by 196.9 ft), fell within an area
covered with a mixture of grasses and oak trees. Pedestrian survey, augmented by shovel testing, led to
the recovery of both prehistoric and historic period artifacts. The prehistoric artifact assemblage included
three flakes of petrified wood recovered from the ground surface, while the historic artifact assemblage
was limited to one shard from a snuff bottle, which originated from a depth of 0 to 10 cmbs (0 to 3.9
inbs). Classified as a site with both early twentieth century farmstead/homestead and indeterminate
prehistoric period components, the site was assessed as not significant applying the National Register of
Historic Places criteria of eligibility (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No further work was recommended at that time.
Although pedestrian survey and shovel testing was performed in the recorded location of Site 41TT560
during this field mobilization and as part of the initial Gulf Crossing investigation (Lackowicz et al.
2008), no evidence of Site 41TT560 was identified within the Project Areas of Potential Effects.

Native American Consultation
As part of the Section 106 compliance process, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC will be sending
certified letters to all federally-recognized Native American groups that may have an interest in the
project area. This includes the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, the
Chickasaw Nation, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, the Mississippi
Band of Choctaw Indians, the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma, the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana and the
Wichita & Affiliated Tribes.
Pipeline Corridor Survey Results
A total of 714 shovel tests were excavated within the 22 survey corridor segments that were assessed as
part of this supplemental field effort. The combined length of these survey segments measured 25.6 km
(15.9 mi) in length; approximately 4.8 km (3.0 mi) of these surveyed corridors have subsequently been
abandoned by Gulf Crossing in favor of alternate routes. Table 1 and the appended USGS quadrangle
sheet excerpts show the location of these survey segments. The fieldwork followed the methods outlined
above.

ST: Shovel Testing

As a result of the examination of these additional survey corridors, one new archeological site (41FK128)
was identified, one previously recorded archeological site (41TT30) was re-visited, and two new historic
structures (HSS-080907a-01 and HSS-145.81-01) were recorded, as was a single new isolated find (IF
108.49-01). With the exception of 41FK128, these cultural resources are situated within the preferred
survey corridor. Gulf Crossing designed a reroute to avoid Site 41FK128 and the nearby site 41FK88,
which was evaluated during the previous field effort (Lackowicz et al. 2008).

Site 41FK128 (Temp. ID A091107A-01)
Type: Prehistoric Period (Caddoan) artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Potentially Eligible
Site 41FK128, a prehistoric Caddoan artifact scatter, is situated southwest of 41FK88, a similar site that
was assessed during the previous field effort as also being potentially eligible (see Lackowicz et al. 2008).
Site 41FK128 was identified during the survey of a reroute designed to avoid Site 41FK88. The site, as
currently defined, measures 60 m by 40 m (197 by 131 ft) in extent (Figure 4). It is located on the north
side of a broad ridge, approximately 250 m (820 ft) south of an unnamed creek. While the upper portion
of the ground surface may have been impacted to some degree by previous logging and natural treefalls,
the site still appears to retain its stratigraphic integrity (Figures 4 and 5). The southern boundary of the
site may extend outside of the surveyed corridor; permission to conduct additional testing outside of the
corridor was not granted by the land owner.
A total of 40 shovel tests were excavated within the vicinity of the site during this supplemental Phase I
cultural resources survey. A total of nine shovel tests produced cultural material (23 percent); i.e., 90
artifacts. This included 39 prehistoric lithic artifacts (Table 3), 24 prehistoric ceramic artifacts (Table 4),
and 27 faunal specimens. The prehistoric lithic artifacts were made predominantly from chert (n=37),
with single examples of quartz/ite and a siltstone/mudstone also recovered. By artifact type, the
assemblage was dominated by debitage (n=33) and fire-cracked rock (n=4). Tool recoveries were limited
to a single expedient edge modified/utilized flake and one formed bifacial tool, specifically a chert cobble
blank exhibited evidence of early stage bifacial flaking along two edges (Figure 6c).
The prehistoric ceramic artifacts recovered from Site 41FK128 were classified by temper type as grittempered (n=3), grit/bone-tempered (n=1), grog-tempered (n=18), and shell-tempered (n=2). Most of
these sherds were classified further as plain walled (n=16) or residual/eroded (n=5). Only three sherds
exhibited any evidence of surface decoration. Engraving was observed on two grog-tempered sherds. One
of these sherds was a rim fragment from a carinated bowl, which exhibited a pair of horizontal engraved
lines, which encircled the vessel shoulder. Additional decoration may have been present on this vessel
between the two engraved lines, but the sherd was too poorly preserved for evaluation or description
(Figure 6a). The second engraved sherd exhibited only a remnant of a single line. The final decorated
sherd was grit-tempered, and it exhibited an appliquéd ridge on the exterior surface (Figure 6b). Although
none of the prehistoric ceramic sherds recovered from Site 41FK128 could be assigned to an established
type, the presence of engraved and appliquéd decoration, as well as the occasional use of shell-tempered
pastes, are generally attributed to Caddoan culture (Perttula 2004; Suhm and Jelks 1962). This also would
be consistent with the assessed age of nearby site 41FK88.
The faunal remains recovered from Site 41FK128 consisted exclusively of invertebrate fragments of
clams and mussels (Bivalvia) family. These were too fragmented to identify to the level of genus or
species. A total of 27 shell fragments were recovered, which collectively weighed 13.7 g.
Based on the type and numbers of artifacts recovered, the site may represent the remains of a short-term
prehistoric camp dating from the Caddoan Period, similar to that found several hundred feet to the
northeast at Site 41FK88. The recovery of shell, along with moderate numbers of lithic and ceramic
artifacts, indicate that food processing and tool manufacturing activities once occurred at the site,
although the size and density of the site indicates it likely was not used extensively or by a large group.
An intact single component site with features that could be dated chronometrically could meet the
eligibility requirements for listing on the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D (the site
may likely yield data of importance to prehistory).

Site 41FK128 may possess the qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic
Places criterion of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [d]). In an attempt to avoid the site, Gulf Crossing recently
rerouted its pipeline to the north so that it runs between Sites 41FK88 and 41FK128, as shown on Sheet
26; this additional corridor was surveyed by R. Christopher Goodwin and Associates, Inc. and no cultural
materials were recovered. To ensure that the cultural materials at 41FK88 and 41FK128 are not
inadvertently affected during construction, several precautions are recommended. First, Gulf Crossing
should mark clearly the outer boundaries of the two sites by placing high visibility fencing along the
construction corridor when the pipeline is being built, first ensuring that the construction corridor remains
outside of the recorded site boundaries. The fencing should extend an additional 20 m (65.6 ft) beyond
the recorded edge of each of the site. Second, it is recommended that Gulf Crossing have a monitor
present during construction of the pipeline to ensure that the two sites are not affected adversely. This
monitor must have the authority to halt construction in the unlikely event that unrecorded human remains
or significant cultural deposits are encountered at the location and the Unanticipated Discovery and
Emergency Procedures Plan needs to be enacted.
Site 41TT30
Type: Prehistoric Period (unidentified period) artifact scatter
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Site 41TT30 first was recorded by Milton Bell in 1969 and it was subsequently assessed in 1988 during a
Phase I cultural resources investigation conducted for the Southern Interconnect pipeline project (Peter et
al. 1989). The site lies within the northern portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing Project corridor at an
approximate elevation of 98 m (320 ft) amsl, on the southwestern edge of a large prominence (Figure 7).
This low-density prehistoric period artifact scatter measured roughly 30 by 20 m (98 by 66 ft) in extent.
The site is situated entirely within a deciduous forest and north of a large seasonally flooded marsh (Sheet
28). The northern boundary of the site as it then was defined extended outside of the surveyed corridor;

permission to conduct additional testing outside of the corridor was not granted by the land owner. The
previously submitted site form identifies the location of the site to be positioned primarily along the
southeast side of the large prominent knoll. It therefore appears likely that most of the site is situated to
the east and northeast of the portion recorded within the surveyed Gulf Crossing Project corridor.
A total of 26 shovel tests were excavated within the vicinity of the previously recorded site, with four (15
percent) of these shovel tests producing cultural material. All of the artifacts were recovered from the top
30 cm (11.8 in) of the ground surface. A typical shovel test excavated within the site area extended to 50
cm (19.7 in) below surface and it exhibited three layers in profile. The first stratum extended from 0 to 10
cm (0 to 3.9 in) below surface and it was characterized as a deposit of gray brown (10YR5/2) sandy loam.
Below this was Stratum II, a layer of yellow (10YR7/8) sandy loam that extended from 10 to 40 cmbs
(3.9 to 15.7 inbs). The basal layer, Stratum III, was characterized as a deposit of yellow brown (10YR5/8)
sandy clay.
Artifacts recovered from Site 41TT30 were limited to small quantities of prehistoric lithic artifacts (Table
4) and prehistoric ceramic sherds (Table 5). The recovered lithic material was classified as chert (n=2),
sandstone (n=1), silicified sandstone (n=4), and an unidentified granitic material (n=1). A single possible
expedient tool, an edge modified/utilized flake also was recovered. The remaining lithic artifacts were
classified as debitage (n=6) or as fire-cracked rock (n=1). The ceramic sherds recovered were plain in
decoration and either were grit (n=2) or grog-tempered (n=3). The presence of prehistoric ceramic sherds
at this site suggests that the dates either from the Woodland stage or the Caddoan period; however, the
sherds are not attributable to any particular period or phase within this general time frame (Perttula 2004).

Figure 7.

Plan view of Site 41TT30.

As defined by the current Phase I cultural resources survey, Site 41TT30 produced a low number of nondiagnostic, prehistoric artifacts. While the artifacts recovered from the site all originated from subsurface
contexts, they were confined to a small area and were few in number. Consequently, the research
potential of this site is limited. Based on information contained on the previously submitted site form, and
the low numbers of artifacts identified within the examined Gulf Crossing survey corridor, demonstrates that
the majority of Site 41TT30 lies to the east and northeast of the current project area. The portion of the site
that lies within the surveyed corridor does not possess the qualities of significance as defined by the National
Register of Historic Places criteria of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [d]). No additional testing of this portion of
the site is recommended.

Historic Structure 145.81-01
Type: Historic Period (20th century) standing structure
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
HSS-145.81-01 consists of a collapsed residential building, associated with a small shed, that is located in
the south-central portion of the preferred Gulf Crossing Project corridor (Figures 8 and 9; Sheet 43). The
collapsed building appears to have been a vernacular bungalow, although the deteriorated condition of the
structure makes it difficult to accurately assess its composition. Similarly, the age of the structure cannot
be definitely ascertained, but the visible exterior wood siding and roof pitch suggests that it may have
been built ca. 1930-40. There was evidence along either side of the house that the building had once
received electricity, although this no longer is the case. The structure is not currently inhabited and it does
not appear to have been occupied for some time.
Visible details of the structure include a collapsed porch roof and a front-gabled façade. Square in plan,
the structure is of wood frame construction and it appears to be raised on wooden blocks. The roofs of the
porch and the main house were sheathed with asphalt shingles and are now heavily damaged. In addition,
the doors and windows appear to have been removed. The small shed and water well were located behind
the residence, however, both are in deteriorated condition. Research of available background resources
discloses no connection of the structure to any significant historical event or person. Examined sources
include county tax assessment records, land grant records held by the Archives & Records Division of the
Texas General Land Office, U.S. census records, The Handbook of Texas Online (Texas State Historical
Association), and various online articles and documents available through the TXGenWeb Project.
Pedestrian survey and shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the structure failed to produce any cultural
materials or evidence of intact cultural deposits. This structure and its associated outbuilding are in a state
of disrepair and they have lost much of their historic integrity and they do not retain their original
qualities of workmanship, associations, and/or feelings. This resource does not possess the qualities of
significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [ad]). No additional recordation of these structures is recommended.

Historic Structure 080907a-01
Type: Historic Period (20th century) standing structure
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
HSS-080907a-01 consists of a collapsed log structure that appears to have served as a barn or other
agricultural outbuilding (Figures 10 to 12). It is situated within woods and the southern edge of the
preferred Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor. The deteriorated condition of the building makes it
difficult to accurately determine its age, but the visible framing suggests that it may have been built ca.
1900-1930. Visible details of the structure include a collapsed metal roof and a main entry, while the
façade appears to have been front-gabled. The framing was comprised of rough hewn logs, left round and
interlocked at the corners with a simple, saddle joint. The barn appears to have been rectangular in plan
and one story in height, with few to no window openings. Background research disclosed no connection
of the structure to any significant historical event or person. Examined sources included county tax
assessment records, land grant records held by the Archives & Records Division of the Texas General
Land Office, U.S. census records, The Handbook of Texas Online (Texas State Historical Association),
and various online articles and documents available through the TXGenWeb Project.
Pedestrian survey and shovel tests excavated throughout the vicinity of the collapsed structure failed to
produce cultural materials or evidence of intact cultural deposits. While this structure may retain its
integrity of materials and location, it has collapsed and now is situated in an overgrown wooded
environment. The structure has lost its historic integrity in terms of workmanship, design, association, and
feeling. It does not possess the qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic
Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional recordation of this structure is
recommended.
Isolated Find 108.49-01
Type: Prehistoric Period (unidentified period) find spot
NRHP Assessment: Recommended Ineligible
Isolated Find 108.49-01 was identified by the recovery of two prehistoric ceramic sherds collected during
at two shovel tests excavated within the preferred Gulf Crossing Project survey corridor (Figure 13). The
material originated from a deciduous forest environment on the far west side of the large natural
prominence shown on Sheet 28. The locus measured 35 by 10 m (114.8 by 32.8 ft) in extent. A typical
shovel test excavated in the area extended to 50 cm (19.7 in) below surface and it exhibited two soil
layers in profile. The first stratum extended only from 0 to 5 cm (0 to 1.9 in) below surface and it was
described as a gray brown (10YR5/2) silty loam. Below this was an apparent B horizon, that extended
from 5 to 50 cmbs (1.9 to 19.7 inbs); it was characterized as a dark yellow brown (10YR4/6) silty loam.
The two artifacts recovered from the locus were classified as sand/grit tempered body sherds. One of
these sherds possessed a sandy paste and had a brushed exterior while the other was undecorated.
Brushing often occurred as a surface treatment associated with several Caddoan ceramic types, but
lacking additional diagnostic attributes it is not possible to distinguish any particular phase within the
Caddoan period (Perttula 2004; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Both sherds were recovered from 10 to 20 cm (3.9
to 7.9 in) below surface; an additional 14 shovel tests excavated around the two artifact producing shovel
tests failed to locate any additional cultural material. Given the low artifact density and absence of intact
cultural materials, Isolated Find 108.49-01 does not posses the qualities of significance as defined by the
National Register of Historic Places criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No additional testing of
this locus of cultural activity is recommended.

Access Road Survey Results
A total of 56 access roads, which measured 40.9 km (25.4 mi) in length were examined as a result of these
supplemental field investigations. Only 45 of the roads are expected to be used by Gulf Crossing to access
the proposed corridor during construction; the remaining 11 roads subsequently were removed from the
project design (Table 6). Nearly all of the Permanent (PAR) and Temporary (TAR) roads consisted of
existing high grade gravel or dirt roads that will not require widening or other significant upgrades.
Greater than 50 percent visibility generally was present and visual inspection of the existing road surface
and side walls was performed along two pedestrian survey transects placed to either side of the existing
road bed. Where visibility dropped below 40 percent (as it did along 12 of the proposed access roads),
shovel tests were excavated adjacent to the road bed in the manner described above. No cultural materials
or features were identified during survey of any of the 56 assessed roadways. No further work is
recommended for these 56 project items.
Appurtenant Facility and Additional Temporary Work Space Survey Results
The current Phase I cultural resources investigation examined six proposed contractor yards and five extra
work spaces; the fieldwork was conducted between June and December of 2007 (Table 7). The proposed
contractor yards will be used for the placement of temporary field engineering buildings, equipment
storage and the placement of pipe. All but one of the facilities were examined using both pedestrian
survey and shovel testing. The exception was Contractor Yard TX-CY-04, which was situated entirely
within a recently cleared field where surface visibility ranged from 60 to 100 percent. The five additional
temporary work spaces extended outside of the standard 91.4 to 106.7 m (300 to 350 ft) wide survey
corridor and each of these locations was assessed through utilizing both pedestrian survey and shovel
testing. Additional

cultural resources investigations are not recommended for any of the examined appurtenant facilities or
extra work spaces. However, a well-defined cemetery with historic (nineteenth to twentieth century)
headstones was identified immediately outside of Contractor Yard TX-CY-05 in Titus County, Texas.
Avoidance of this area and the installation of safety fencing around the cemetery boundary is
recommended.
Historic Cemetery CEM-CY-TX-05-01
Type: Historic Cemetery (19th-20th Centuries)
NRHP Assessment: Not Assessed
This cemetery is situated immediately outside the southern boundary of the proposed Gulf Crossing
Contractor Yard TX-CY-05 located in Titus County (see Sheet 58 and Figure 14). This is a small private
cemetery that is measures approximately 30 m (98.4 ft) on a side and it is square in plan view. While most
of the graves appear to date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, based on the markings
observed on some of the headstones, the cemetery still may be in use by the local community. The
boundaries of the cemetery are well-defined and it appears to be maintained (Figure 15). R. Christopher
Goodwin & Associates, Inc. recorded all of the legible grave markers identified within the boundaries of
the cemetery. There were a total of 23 gravestones; two of which may inter Civil War (CSA) era veterans
(Figure 16).
Cemeteries are not automatically considered historic properties under the National Register of Historic
Places criteria of evaluation. The historic research necessary to determine whether the individuals interred
at CEM-TX-CY-05-01 have the requisite level of local, state or national significance was not performed
for the current undertaking, since the edge of the cemetery lies outside of the Areas of Potential Effects.
As the cemetery lies outside of the boundaries of the proposed contractor yard, no impacts to the cemetery
should occur as a result of its use as a contractor yard. To ensure that the cemetery is not impacted
inadvertently during construction, several precautions are recommended. First, it is recommended that
Gulf Crossing mark clearly the boundary of the cemetery while the contractor yard is in use by placing
high visibility fencing at least 3 m (10 ft) to the north and east of the existing cemetery fence. The fencing
should extend the length of the existing cemetery boundary plus an additional 20 m (65.6 ft) beyond each
marked corner. Second, it is recommended that Gulf Crossing have a monitor regularly check the status of
the fencing to ensure that the cemetery is not affected adversely.

Gulf Crossing Project
Addendum Report #1 – June 2009

Summary and Recommendations
Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC is filing an application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity with the lead federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), for
authorization to construct and operate the Gulf Crossing Project. The Gulf Crossing Project is a 568.4 km
(374.1 mi) long, 42-inch O.D. natural gas pipeline that crosses multiple counties and parishes in Texas,
Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi; approximately 175.1 km (108.8 mi) of the project length extends
through northeastern Texas.
Between June and December of 2007, additional Phase I cultural resources investigation was completed
for the proposed project in Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Franklin, Titus, Morris, and Cass Counties. This
Phase I cultural resources survey and architectural inventory report is intended to provide relevant
information to the Texas Historical Commission (the State Historic Preservation Office) and the FERC
and assist those agencies in conducting their Section 106 review of the proposed undertaking.
The current field effort was designed to identify and to evaluate all cultural resources situated within the
Areas of Potential Effects that may be impacted by this undertaking. The survey examined 217.0 ha
(536.3 ac) of new pipeline rights-of-way and additional temporary workspaces, 14.2 ha (5.1 ac)
associated with 54 access roads and 77.0 ha (190.2 ac) distributed across six contractor yards.
Approximately 1.9 km (1.2 mi) of the preferred pipeline right-of-way and 11 access roads measuring 11.3
km (18.2 km) in length remain unexamined due to landowners denying survey permission (Tables 8 and
9). Additional Phase I cultural resources survey and, where appropriate, geoarcheological investigations
must be conducted for these unexamined project items. These additional surveys should be completed by
spring 2008.

Only six cultural resources were identified or re-identified as a result of the supplemental field effort
(Table 10). Newly recorded Site 41FK128 is a prehistoric (Early to Middle Caddo Period) artifact scatter
that was lies within the examined survey corridor. Due to the types of the material recovered the
possibility of the site to contain intact cultural deposits, the site may possess the qualities of significance

as defined by the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4. Gulf Crossing
has designed a new route alignment that should avoid all impacts to the site. The installation of safety
fencing along the boundary of the construction corridor positioned closest to the site is recommended.
Monitoring during construction also is recommended to ensure that site is not impacted adversely during
construction.

The field investigation also relocated Site 41TT30. The entirety of Site 41TT30 could not be evaluated
since the landowners restricted survey to the 106.7 m (350 ft) wide assessment corridor. The portion of
the site that lies within the survey corridor for the proposed Gulf Crossing Project consists of a sparse
scatter of prehistoric material. The examined portions of the site do not possess the qualities of
significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places criteria of evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [ad]). Nearby Isolated Find 108.49-01 produced two prehistoric sherds from subsurface contexts. This nonsite locus does not possess the qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic
Places criteria of evaluation.
In addition, two historic structures were identified within the survey corridor examined in association
with the Gulf Crossing Project Area of Potential Effects. HSS-080907a-01, located in Morris County,
consists of a collapsed log structure that may have been a barn or agricultural outbuilding. It was situated
within woods and near the southern edge of the preferred Gulf Crossing survey corridor. HSS-145.81-01
is located in Cass County and it consists of a collapsed vernacular bungalow associated with a
deteriorated small shed. The structures at both HSS-080907a-01 and HSS-145.81-01 appear to date from
the twentieth century. Pedestrian survey and shovel tests excavated throughout the vicinity of each of
these structures failed to produce any cultural materials or evidence of intact cultural deposits. Neither
structure possesses the qualities of significance as defined by the National Register of Historic Places
criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). No further recordation of these structures is recommended.
The additional field investigations also recorded a well-defined historic period cemetery positioned
immediately outside the southwestern boundary of proposed Contractor Yard TX-CY-05 in Titus County.
To ensure that the cemetery is not damaged inadvertently during construction, several precautions are
recommended; these include the installation of fencing and monitoring during construction.
