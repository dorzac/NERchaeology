ABSTRACT

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to construct an interchange at IH
30 for the new SH 205 bypass in Rockwall, Rockwall County, Texas, (CSJ 0009-12-073). The
project length is approximately 1.08 miles along IH 30 initiating 0.62 miles east of the present SH
205 (Goliad Street)/IH 30 intersection and terminating 0.30 miles west of FM 549. Additional
right-of-way (ROW) will be required for the construction of the bypass interchange, measuring 5
feet except at the area of the interchange which will be a maximum of 40 feet, for a maximum of
24.8 acres. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project is restricted to the area including
the existing ROW and the additional footage. A reconnaissance survey of the project area was
conducted to determine whether there is a potential for archeological deposits or remains in the
project area and whether those resources may be impacted by future construction within the
proposed construction area of the current and new ROW. All notes and photos will be
permanently curated at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at
Austin.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to construct a new interchange
for the new SH 205 bypass at IH 30 in Rockwall, Rockwall County (Figures 1 and 2). The
project (CSJ 0009-12-073) entails impacts to approximate 1.08 miles along IH 30 initiating 0.62
miles east of the present SH 205 (Goliad Street)/IH 30 intersection and terminating 0.30 miles
west of FM 549. Additional right-of-way (ROW) will be required for the construction of the
bypass interchange, measuring 5 feet except at the area of the interchange, which will be a
maximum of 40 feet. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this project is restricted to the area
including the existing right-of-way and the additional footage, for a total maxium of 24.8 acres.
The planning and engineering firm Turner Collie & Braden, Inc. (TCB), has been contracted to
plan the improvements and conduct the environmental studies associated with those
improvements. In turn, TCB has subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., of Plano, Texas, to
perform a reconnaissance survey of the proposed project corridor in order to determine whether
there is a potential for existing archeological resources that might be impacted by future
construction activities (GMI Project #30011.08.01.03). This survey was conducted on 10
September 2006 by Melissa M. Green, Principal Investigator for the project. The following
report details the reconnaissance undertaken as part of the environmental study.

PROJECT SETTING
The project area lies on an upland finger situated between the upper portion of Buffalo Creek and
an unnamed tributary. The area is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Marlbrook Marl also
known as the “upper Taylor marl” (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972, revised 1987). The soil
mapped in the project area is Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, a gently sloping soil on
broad watershed divides. This soil is part of the Houston Black-Heiden association; moderately
well drained and well drained, very slowly permeable, calcareous soils that are clayey throughout
(Pringle 1977). The area is primarily rural and agricultural, with some “urban sprawl” beginning
to creep in. Vegetation along the corridor consisted of Johnson grass, wild flowers, a mixture of
other grasses and weeds, and a few scattered cedar, hackberry, and mulberry trees.

CULTURAL SETTING
Prikryl (1987) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods for
the Upper Trinity River Basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at both
lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here (Table
1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations but is
based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown (1990;
Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake, but it closely
follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. Detailed synopses of the chronology of the area
can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

METHODS
Prior to any fieldwork, a review of the Texas Site Atlas website (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us –
access restricted) was conducted to determine if any known sites were located within either the
project corridor or within a one-mile radius of the corridor. Two previously recorded sites were
noted just outside the one mile radius of the project area, though none were located in the project
corridor itself. The sites, though outside of the proscribed review radius, are listed in Table 2 and
the information about these taken from site forms for informational purposes only. Since neither
of these sites are located within the project corridor, no revisits were attempted; however both are
likely to be gone due to development.

The field methods consisted of a reconnaissance inspection. Photographs were taken of the
general landscape along the route. Walkover of the fields where the bypass construction impacts
are to occur was also conducted in order to provide for a better understanding of the parcels
within and outside of the ROW. Notes were taken of the conditions and observations along the
entire route. These notes and photographs will be permanently curated a Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.

OBSERVATIONS
The project corridor is situated on an upland finger between the upper part of Buffalo Creek and
an unnamed tributary. The area was completely rural until fairly recently when the City of
Rockwall began to grow to the east. New commercial ventures have developed along the
frontage roads on both the north and south sides (Figures 3 and 4). Two newly plowed corn
fields are in the project area as well. The site of the interchange is located in fallow fields on both
sides of IH 30, though the field on the south side was terraced sometime in the past (Figures 5 and
6). Visibility was extremely good. The general area has been previously impacted by the
construction of IH 30 and its frontage roads. Drainage ditches between the east and west bound
lanes and their frontage roads have been sculpted and landscaped with grasses to curtail erosion.
The soils are vertisolic and due to the extreme drought, large cracks (Figure 7) were noted all
throughout the current and proposed right-of-way. In addition, numerous buried utilities (gas,
water, fiber optic) are marked and visible within the right-of-way, along with aerial lines (Figure
8). Four geotechnical bore test holes, two on the north and two on the south side of IH 30, were
noted in the interchange location. No cultural remains were identified during the survey. The
project area retains little to no potential for containing any archeological remains.

RECOMMENDATIONS
This portion of IH 30 is located on an upland finger between Buffalo Creek and an unnamed
tributary. The existing ROW has already been impacted by the construction of the utilities noted
above, i.e., light poles, overhead electrical lines, buried telephone and fiber optic lines, and gas,
water, and sewer lines. The areas on both sides of IH 30 requiring new ROW for the interchange
are in fallow fields, though the one on the south side of the highway was terraced in the past. No
evidence of any archeological remains, cultural deposits, or paleosols was identified in the project
area and there is no likelihood of surface or subsurface sites in this area. Therefore, it is
recommended that proposed construction would have no effect on historic properties. Although
the likelihood of discovering undisturbed archeological resources during the proposed project
implementation is low, should evidence of archeological resources be identified during
construction, work in the immediate area would cease, and TxDOT archeological staff would be
contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures in accordance with the Programmatic
Agreement (PA) among the Federal Highway Administration (FWHA), the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP), and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC.
