ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of 15 high probability areas was conducted by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in Hill County, Texas in August and
September of 2005 under Antiquities Permit 3888 for the Woodrow-Osceola
Water Supply Corporation (WSC). In all, 69 acres were examined, and no
archaeological sites were found to be within any of the 15 areas. The Jawbone
Cemetery and Blanton Cemetery are near the project area, but they will not be
affected. It is recommended that construction of the water line be allowed to
proceed in the rest of the project area without further consultation from the Texas
Historical Commission. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
The Woodrow-Osceola WSC is applying for funds from the United States
Department of Agriculture, Rural Development to improve its water distribution
system by adding new line and a deep well and pump station in central Hill
County, Texas (Figure 1). The fifteen segments of the water line and the site of a
deep well and pump station were selected as high probability areas for survey.
This selection was based on proximity to creeks as depicted on four 7.5’
topographic quadrangles and a field assessment. The topographic quadrangles
are Blanton (3297-121), dated 1966 and current as of 1976; Covington (3297124), dated 1976 and current as of 1978; Hillsboro West (3297-112), dated 1966
and current as of 1976; and Itasca (3297-113), dated 1965. The project area is
depicted in Figure 2.
The water line will be routed along state highways, county roads, and
farm-to-market roads and will be placed on private property within five feet of
existing line. New line will only be installed in Area 10. The pipe will be placed in
a trench two feet wide and between three and four feet deep. No water line will
be routed through a cemetery, marked graves, or burial plots. When necessary,
the water line will be routed through the highway right-of-way if adjacent to a
cemetery or on the side of the highway opposite a cemetery.
An archaeological survey was requested in a letter from the State Historic
Preservation Officer (Texas Historical Commission) to Becky J. Richards, P.G. of
ETI dated April 22, 2004. The Woodrow-Osceola WSC retained Brazos Valley
Research Associates to perform this service.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information was taken from the soil survey for Hill County
(Brooks 1978). Hill County is located within three land resource areas in northcentral Texas. These are the Blackland Prairie, Grand Prairie, and East Cross
Timbers. It is bounded on the north by Johnson County, on the south by
Limestone and McLennan counties, on the east by Ellis and Navarro counties,
and on the west by Lake Whitney and the Brazos River. The county is 657,920
acres in size, and elevation ranges from about 400 to 900 feet above sea level.
The area is nearly level to rolling and well dissected by natural streams. About
46 percent of the area is used for general field crops. Thirty-two percent is in
pasture, 13 percent is rangeland, 6 percent is urban land and water, and woods
account for 3 percent. Most of the rangeland is in the northwestern part of the
county within the Grand Prairie Land Resource Area.
The soils of Hill County formed under a cover of tall grasses. Most of the
soils are dark and clayey and crack severely when dry. Water erosion is a major
conservation problem. Soil is the most important natural resource in Hill County.
The soils formed mainly from limestone and marl and have high natural fertility.
They produce good crops and pasture, which support strong, healthy livestock.
The main limestone formations in the county are the Austin Chalk that crops out
in the center of the county, and part of the Washita Group which crops out in the
northwestern part of the county. The Woodbine, Eagle Foard, and Ozan
formations consist of soft sandstone, shale, and marl and underlie most of the
county. According to the General Soil Map for Hill County, the project area is
located within deep to moderately deep clayey prairie soils and deep sandy and
loamy savannah soils. The prairie soils are known as Houston Black-HeidenAltoga. These are deep, nearly level to gently sloping, moderately alkaline
clayey soils. The savannah soils are known as Tinn-Pursley. These are deep,
nearly level, moderately alkaline loamy and clayey soils.
An overview of the geology of the Aquilla Creek watershed was prepared
by Ronald Ritchie and Bob H. Slaughter (1972). Their work is presented as an
appendix to the 1972 report assembled by S. Alan Skinner. A botanical
summary of the Aquilla Creek watershed was prepared by Jerry M. Flook (1972).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in a region referred to by Biesaart et al. (1985)
in a statistical overview as the North Central Texas cultural geographical region.
In 1985, when the overview was published, this region contained 2678 recorded
archaeological sites (13.25% of the state). In Hill County, there were 242 known
prehistoric sites as of 1985. These sites are classified as Paleoindian (n=11),
Early Archaic (n=2), Middle Archaic (n=13), Late Archaic (n=58), General Archaic
(n=28), and Late Prehistoric (n=50). Today, five prehistoric sites (41HI1, 41HI17,
41HI41, 41HI53, and 41HI55) are listed in the National Register of Historic
Places. Two historic sites (Hill County Courthouse and Hill County Jail) and the
Hillsboro Multiple Resource Group (various historic buildings) are also listed in
the National Register of Historic Places. The Aquilla Reservoir Multiple
Resource Area (126 prehistoric sites and 81 historic sites) has been determined
to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. State
Archeological Landmark status has been given to the Hill County Courthouse
and the Katy Depot (Missouri-Kansas-Texas Company Railroad Station).
Archaeological sites in the county have been disturbed through erosion,
construction, and vandalism. Sites are described in the overview as deflated,
dispersed, surface collected, and destroyed. Only one site is referred to as
pristine. In 1985, the number of excavated sites was 10. Sixty-three sites had
been tested by hand, and two sites had been tested by machine. The number of
surface collected sites is large at 222. Today, there are at least 290 recorded
sites in Hill County. No figures exist regarding the number of sites that have
been disturbed and/or tested and excavated. The overview describes
subsistence-related features at prehistoric sites in Hill County as hearths, burned
rock features, and pits. Ten sites were reported to contain burials. Technologyrelated features include stone quarries, caches, shell and stone tool
manufacturing areas. The overview does not give site numbers.
Archaeological survey and testing projects have been conducted by
various contract firms and universities throughout Hill County. The nearest major
study for this area was performed in the Aquilla Creek watershed to the west of
the project area. Most of this work was performed by archaeologists from
Southern Methodist University (SMU) and the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS).
TARL records revealed that the earliest work at Aquilla Creek watershed was
conducted by SMU in 1972 (Skinner 1972). This study was concentrated along
Aquilla Creek and Hackberry Creek, and investigated 3280 acres. In all, 125
prehistoric sites (41HI31 – 41HI155) were recorded. Sites were found in various
topographic settings such as edges of creeks, floodplains, floodplain rises,
upland bases, uplands slopes, and uplands. No historic sites are mentioned in
the report, but there is a summary of the history of the watershed. An interim
report (Skinner 1975) was submitted to the Soil Conservation Service in 1975.

This study revealed that the major period of occupation in the project area
was during the Archaic period of Texas prehistory. Some evidence was found to
suggest earlier habitation of the area, circa 8000 B.C. – A.D. 1500. No historic
Indian sites were found. Analysis of the settlement patterns and the artifact
assemblages suggests that the sites represent short-term campsites at which
similar activities were carried out (Skinner 1972:56). These activities include tool
manufacture, mussel shell gathering, and hunting. To a lesser extent, quarrying
and processing of plant foods were performed. A paucity of ground stone tool
fragments (especially manos and metates) was interpreted by the researchers as
evidence that plant food processing was not an important activity. Skinner
mentions, for example, that sites along Brazos River alluvial terraces often yield
large numbers of ground stone tools. These sites are referred to as base camps,
and they are larger in area than those in the Aquilla Creek watershed. Skinner
hypothesizes that the small size of the sites along Aquilla Creek and Hackberry
Creek and the scarcity of cultural remains suggests that occupation of the
watershed was for short periods of time and seasonal. The presence of
temporally different projectile points at one location is viewed as evidence for reoccupation of suitable camp locations.
In 1975, SMU returned to the area and completed the survey of the
proposed reservoir initiated in 1972 (Lynott and Peter 1977). In addition to
survey, test excavations were conducted at 22 sites. In all, 68 new sites were
recorded. Site types include campsites, lithic scatters, quarries and workshops,
and shell middens. These sites date to the Archaic and Woodland/Early Ceramic
periods of Texas prehistory. The report by Lynott and Peter contains a very
thorough review of the area.
Archaeologists from SMU returned to Aquilla Lake in 1977 (Skinner et al.
1978) and continued to test sites found during the survey. The purpose of this
study was to assess sites in the project area for their eligibility for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places and to evaluate various archaeological
problems relevant to the project area. This investigation found that sites in the
project area date from Paleoindian times to the Late Prehistoric. Not one of the
sites tested yielded datable organic remains. The authors recommended that
single component sites be identified and tested in order to refine the local
chronology and to provide meaningful study units.
More testing was carried out by SMU in 1978 (Skinner et al. 1979).
Testing at seven sites allowed the researchers to make comparisons of sites
from the southern two-thirds of the Central Brazos River Basin with those at
Aquilla Lake. It was learned that significant changes in settlement patterns in
time and space took place. Site types include a burned rock midden, campsite,
lithic scatter, and a shell midden. The site numbers in the report were assigned
by SMU. In this report, TARL numbers are used. They are 41HI58, 41HI122,
41HI123, 41HI124, 41HI139, 41HI144, and 41HI167.

In 1982, Richard Paul Watson submitted his dissertation to the Graduate
School at The University of Texas at Austin under the title The Archeology of
Aquilla Reservoir: Implications for a Regional Research Design for the Central
Brazos River Basin, Texas. The purpose of his study was describe and discuss
the research undertaken in the Aquilla Creek watershed in 1979 and 1980, to
propose a regional research design for the entire Central Brazos River region,
and to analyze evidence from investigations at sites in the Aquilla watershed in
terms of the proposed regional perspective. His research is based on data from
sites 41HI74, 41HI76, 41HI77, 41HI104, and 41HI105.
In his conclusions Watson states that a direct continuity of the Paleoindian
and Archaic adaptations has been proposed, and the utility of the Paleoindian
Stage as a heuristic concept has been questioned for use in the Central Brazos
River region. In addition, he presents a significant re-adaptation from the
exploitation of bison during the Late Archaic sub-stage to the exploitation of deer
during Late Prehistoric times in order to explain the dramatically different
assemblages and settlement patterns apparent during these stages. Finally, he
proposes a social interaction hypothesis involving inter-group marriage between
native Central Brazos River groups and the East Texas Caddo to explain the
presence of Caddoan style ceramics in the Central Brazos region.
In 1987, the David O. Brown (1987) reported the results of the final three
seasons of work at Aquilla Lake for the Texas Archeological Survey. His work is
presented in three volumes. This is a very detailed overview of the archaeology
of the Aquilla Creek watershed and vicinity. Topics discussed include a
summary of environment, previous research, local history, data collection, site
types, culture history, and conclusions. This source is recommended for those
with an interest in the archaeology of Central Texas.
Between 1998 and 1999, archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
conducted an archaeological survey and geo-archaeological assessment of
approximately 31 miles of water pipeline right-of-way from Aquilla Lake to Lake
Pat Cleburne in northwestern Hill County and south-central Johnson County
(Arnn and Gadus 1999). Seven new sites were found and recorded, and one
previously recorded site was revisited. Hill County sites discussed in this report
are 41HI279 – 41HI283. Site 41HI280 was recommended as potentially eligible
for listing on the National Register of Historic Places and designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. It is in a depositional setting and has buried cultural
materials that may represent a discrete, isolable component.
There are several sources that are relevant to this study, but they are not
directly related. The interested reader is referred to Appendix I for a list of
suggesting readings.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin were
checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and vicinity. In addition, a review of the existing literature for Hill
County was conducted. This background work resulted in the identification of 15
high probability areas to be investigated. An additional two areas across from
known cemeteries were also noted. A 100% Pedestrian Survey with shovel
testing was conducted in August and September of 2005. This survey was
based on a Research Design that was submitted to the Texas Historical Design,
Archeology Division during the planning stages of this project (Appendix II).
When possible, eroded and otherwise exposed areas within the various rights-ofway were examined for surface indications of prehistoric and historic sites in
each of the high probability areas.
The subsurface was examined through 79 shovel tests in 15 areas. No
additional areas worthy of survey were noted. Each shovel test was recorded on
a shovel test log (Appendix III) and discussed in the project notes. Locations of
shovel tests are depicted on drafted maps in the Discussion of Areas Surveyed
section below. The excavated matrix was screened using quarter-inch hardware
cloth when possible. In some areas, however, heavy clays made normal
screening impossible. The matrix from these tests was examined by manually
breaking apart the clay.
During the course of this survey two cemeteries were observed near the
route of the proposed water line. These are Jawbone Cemetery and an
unnamed cemetery near the community of Blanton. These historic sites are
outside the project area; therefore, no site numbers were assigned. They were,
however, visited and photographed.

PROJECT AREAS
The proposed project involves twenty areas in various parts of the county.
Each area is depicted on the relevant 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV), and the areas with approximate locations of shovel tests are
depicted on drafted maps (Appendix V).
Area 1-3
These areas are depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This one-acre
tract is the proposed location for a deep well and pump station (Area 1), ground
storage tank (Area 2), and elevated storage tank (Area 3). It is on the south side
of County Road 1446 and is situated on a hill overlooking an intermittent tributary
of Little Aquilla Creek 0.35 kilometers to the west. At the time of this survey it
was fenced and covered with thick weeds. The entire area was subjected to a
100% Pedestrian Survey, and four negative shovel tests were excavated. The
soil in this area is orange sand 20-30 cm deep over orange clay.
Area 4
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 6100-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 4-inch water line with an 8”
water line on the south side of Farm-to-Market Road 934. The new line will be
placed approximately 4-5 feet from the existing line on private property within an
existing easement of 15 feet. Since there are nearby sources of water, this area
was not considered a likely setting for a prehistoric site. Because of the
presence of the Blanton Cemetery across the road from Area 4, the area was
examined and no graves were observed. The cemetery was fenced and well
maintained. The earliest headstone observed was dated 1896. In addition, there
were several graves dating to the early 20th century.
Area 5
This area is depicted on the Covington 7.5’ quadrangle. This 5500-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5-inch water line with an 8”
water line on the east side of County Road 1414. The new line will be placed
approximately 4-5 feet from the existing line on private property within an existing
easement of 15 feet. The only stream crossings are the upper reaches of three
unnamed tributaries of Aquilla Creek. At the time of this survey the area was in
pasture and scattered trees with little understory, and the soil is a thin layer of
clay loam over firm orange clay. The entire area was subjected to a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, and eight negative shovel tests were excavated to a
maximum depth of 10 cm.

9

Area 6
This area is depicted on the Hillsboro West 7.5’ quadrangle. This 17,500foot segment is planned for replacement of an existing 2-inch water line with a 6”
water line on the west side of State Highway 171 and north side of County Road
1343 West. The new line will be placed approximately 4-5 feet from the existing
line on private property within an existing easement of 15 feet. Two segments of
Area 6 were examined, and they are described in this report as Survey Area 6A
and Survey Area 6B.
Survey Area 6A was on private property at the crossing of a branch of
Hackberry Creek. At the time of this survey the area was in a cornfield, pasture,
and a yard. The soil survey map indicated that alluvial deposition might be
present in part of this area. Therefore, an effort was made to investigate the
subsurface to four feet, the maximum depth of the Area of Potential Effect (APE).
A deep clay loam was found on the northwestern end of the project area. This
area was in a cornfield. Next to it was the right-of-way, which had a wide ditch
three to four feet lower than the top of the project area. The clay was very dry
and hard. It could only be excavated to about 50 cm before any recent surface
moisture was gone. A plan was devised to dig a series of three shovel tests to
reach the bottom of the APE. Shovel Test 1 was excavated on the top of the
cornfield to 50 cm. Shovel 2 was placed down slope starting about 50 cm lower
than the top of Shovel Test 1. It was excavated to 50 cm and terminated as the
hard clay prevented further digging. Shovel Test 3 was placed at the bottom of
the ditch and excavated to 30 cm where basal clay was encountered. A second
area (shovel tests 4-6) was excavated following the same procedure. At Shovel
Test 7, the ditch presented a cut bank face 120 cm deep. A profile was cleaned
and shovel tested by level. Basal clay was found at 80 cm. Two shovel tests (8
and 9) were excavated at the creek where the alluvial clay was only 40 cm deep
over basal clay. Two more shovel tests (10 and 11) were excavated upslope
where basal clay was found at shallow depths. The entire area was visually
inspected.
Survey Area 6B
The only stream crossing is Little Hackberry Creek. At the time of this
survey the area was in a cornfield, pasture, and a yard. The entire area was
subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and five negative shovel tests were
excavated to a maximum depth of 60 cm. According to the soil survey map,
alluvial deposition may exist in parts of this area. The shovel tests revealed dark
gray alluvial clay to a depth of 60 cm. Below this was a yellow clay containing
caliche.

10

Area 7
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 13,400-foot
segment is planed for replacement of an existing 1.5” water line with a 6” water
line. It is on the east side of Farm-to-Market Road 933. Two segments of Area 7
were examined, and they are described in this report as survey areas 7A and 7B.
Survey Area 7A
This area is located on the eastern side of Farm-to-Market Road 933
where a tributary of Cedar Creek crosses the highway. At the time of this survey
the area was in wooded pasture and consisted of clay and limestone with some
bedded limestone outcrops. The entire area was subjected to a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, and seven negative shovel tests were excavated to a
maximum depth of 20 cm.
Survey Area 7B
This area is located on the eastern side of Farm-to-Market Road 933
where a tributary of Cedar Creek crosses the highway. At the time of this survey
this area was in wooded pasture, and clay and limestone was present at or near
the surface. The entire area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and
four negative shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cm.
Area 8
This area is depicted on the Itasca 7.5’ quadrangle. This 24,000-foot
segment is planed for replacement of an existing 2” water line with a 6” water
line. It is on the north side of Farm-to-Market Road 2719. The only stream
crossings are Cottonwood Creek and a tributary of Island Creek. At the time of
this survey most of the area was in cornfields, and surface visibility was
excellent. The soil in this area is dark gray prairie clay with no alluvial deposition.
Sandstone and caliche gravels were present. The entire area was subjected to a
100% Pedestrian Survey, and five shovel tests were excavated to a maximum
depth of 30 cm. No cultural materials were observed.
Area 9
This area is depicted on the Blanton and Covington 7.5’ quadrangles.
This 11,500-foot segment is planed for replacement of an existing 6” water line
with an 8” water line. It is on the south and east sides of County Road 1430.
The only stream crossing is an unnamed tributary. This is a low probability area
for a prehistoric site. Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The entire
area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and no structures were
observed in the APE.

11

Area 10
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 5500-foot
segment is planed for the installation of new 6” water line. It is on the south and
east sides of Farm-to-Market Road 3050. There are no stream crossings;
however, a portion of the APE is on high ground overlooking an unnamed
tributary and Little Aquilla Creek is 0.7 kilometers to the west. At the time of this
survey most of the area was in cornfields, and surface visibility was excellent.
The soil is dark gray prairie clay with no alluvial deposition, and sandstone and
caliche gravels were present. The entire area was subjected to a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, and four shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of
30 cm. No cultural materials were observed.
Area 11
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 10,500-foot
segment is planned for replacement of existing 2” and 6” water lines with an 8”
line. It is on the south and east sides of County Road 1300. Since this area
does not involve any major stream crossings, shovel testing was not considered
necessary. Because of the presence of Jawbone Cemetery on the west side of
the highway near the intersection of Area 11 and Area 12, a surface inspection
was conducted in the area nearest the cemetery and no graves were observed
within the APE. At the time of this survey, the cemetery was fenced and well
maintained. Dates on the headstones ranged from 1882 to the present.
Area 12
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 1600-foot
segment is planned for replacement of existing 2” water line with an 8” line. It is
on the south side of County Road 1217. The nearest water is Little Aquilla Creek
0.66 kilometers to the west.
Area 13
This area is depicted on the Blanton, Covington, and Itasca 7.5’
quadrangles. This 32,000-foot segment is planned for replacement of an existing
1.5” and 2” water lines with an 8” line. It is on the west side of County Road 1450
North and County Road South. Three segments of Area 13 were examined, and
they are described in this report as survey areas 13A, 13B, and 13C.

12

Survey Area 13A
This area crosses an unnamed tributary of Aquilla Creek. At the time of
this survey, the area had been cleared and contained scattered trees. The entire
area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and seven negative shovel
tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cm. Soils in this area consist of
orange clay with ironstone fragments and sandstone fragments in some areas.
There was no alluvial deposition.
Survey Area 13B
This area crosses an unnamed tributary of Aquilla Creek. At the time of
this survey the area was in pasture and contained scattered trees. The entire
area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and seven negative shovel
tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 20 cm. Soils in this area consist of
yellow-orange clay with sandstone fragments. There was no alluvial deposition.
Survey Area 13C
This area crosses an unnamed tributary of Aquilla Creek. At the time of
this survey the area was in pasture and contained scattered trees. The entire
area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey. The subsurface was
examined by digging shovel probes, and no cultural materials were observed.
Soils in this area consist of yellow-orange clay with sandstone fragments. There
was no alluvial deposition.
Area 14
This area is depicted on the Blanton 7.5’ quadrangle. This 1500-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5” water line with a 6” water
line. It is on the east side of County Road 1361 that traverses and high hill
overlooking Aquilla Creek 1.15 kilometers to the west. At the time of this survey,
the area was covered with grasses and visibility was good. The soil consisted of
orange sand over orange clay. The entire area was subjected to a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, and two shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of
40 cm. No cultural materials were observed.

13

Area 15
This area is depicted on the Itasca 7.5’ quadrangle. This 8700-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5” water line with a 6” water
line. It is on the south side of Farm-to-Market Road 934. This area crosses a
small tributary of Hackberry Creek. At the time of this survey the area was in
pasture with good surface visibility. The entire area was subjected to a 100%
Pedestrian Survey. The subsurface was investigated by shovel tests and
probes. Five shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 30 cm, and no
cultural materials were observed. Soils in this area consisted of dark gray prairie
clay with no alluvial deposition.
Area 16
This area is depicted on the Blanton and Covington 7.5’ quadrangles.
This 21,500-foot segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5” water
line with a 6” line. It is on the west side of Farm-to-Market Road 3049 and the
north side of County Road 1143. The only stream crossings are three unnamed
tributaries of Rock Creek. This is an area not likely to contain a prehistoric site;
therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The surface was visually inspected,
and no evidence of historic utilization was observed.
Area 17
This area is depicted on the Covington 7.5’ quadrangle. This 5000-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5” water line with a 6” line. It
is on the north side of State Highway 67. This area crosses a tributary of Aquilla
Creek. At the time of this survey it was in pasture with woods along the creek.
The entire area was subjected to a 100% Pedestrian Survey and five shovel tests
excavated to a maximum depth of 30 cm. In addition, the area was probed with
a shovel. The soils consist of a clay loam over clay with no alluvial deposition.
No cultural materials were observed.
Area 18
This area is depicted on the Covington 7.5’ quadrangle. This 8000-foot
segment is planned for replacement of an existing 1.5” water line with a 6’ line. It
is on the west side of Farm-to-Market Road 2488. The only stream crossing is
an unnamed tributary of Gourd Neck Branch. This is an area not likely to contain
a prehistoric site; therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The surface was
visually inspected, and no evidence of historic utilization was observed.

This area is depicted on the Itasca 7.5’ quadrangle. This 4000-foot
segment is planned for replacement of existing 1.5” and 6” water lines with an 8”
line. The new line will be placed approximately 4-5 feet from the existing line on
private property within an existing easement of 15 feet. It is on the east side of
State Highway 171. There are no creek crossings. This is an area not likely to
contain a prehistoric site; therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The surface
was visually inspected, and no evidence of historic utilization was observed.
Area 20
This area is depicted on the Hillsboro West and Itasca 7.5’ quadrangles.
This 21,000-foot segment is planned for replacement of existing 1.5” and 3”
water lines with an 8” line. The new line will be placed approximately 4-5 feet
from the existing line on private property within an existing easement of 15 feet It
is on the west side of County road 1458. The only stream crossings are
Cottonwood Creek and an unnamed tributary of Cottonwood Creek. At the time
of this survey the northern segment was in cornfields, and surface visibility was
excellent. The creek area was wooded, and the southern segment was between
two fences and contained weeds and grasses. The entire area was subjected to
a 100% Pedestrian Survey, and five shovel tests were excavated to a maximum
depth of 30 cm. Soils in this area consisted of a dark gray prairie clay with no
alluvial deposition. No cultural materials were observed.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL indicated an absence of archaeological sites
within the path of the water line as currently proposed or the one-acre site of the
wastewater treatment plant. No prehistoric sites were found as a result of this
survey. The authors attribute this to a lack of chert in the areas surveyed,
shallow soils on the uplands and terraces, and a paucity of major stream
crossings. The predominant vegetation throughout the project area at the time of
this survey consisted of pasture, cornfields, grasses, and woods. Two
cemeteries were found to be near the path of the water line; however, they are
on the opposite side of the highway from the proposed water line. These are
Jawbone Cemetery in Area 11 and the Blanton Cemetery in Area 4.

16

RECOMMENDATIONS
The water line as currently proposed will pass near two cemeteries. It is
recommended that all construction be restricted to the opposite side of the
highway. Should the water line be changed to the same side of the highway as
either or both of these cemeteries, it is recommended that the area be scraped
under the supervision of a professional archaeologist to ensure that no unmarked
graves are disturbed. If construction of the water line along the highway opposite
either or both of these cemeteries uncovers unmarked graves, all work must stop
until the Texas Historical Commission can evaluate the situation.
Since no archaeological sites were found within the path of the water line,
it is recommended that the Woodrow-Osceola WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned. If a prehistoric archaeological site is found during
construction of the water line all work must stop in the area of the find until the
Texas Historical Commission can assess the situation. If the Area of Potential
Affect changes to include construction of the water line in areas not surveyed
during this project, the Texas Historical Commission must be notified, as further
survey may be required.
This project was conducted following the Minimum Survey Standards as
defined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

APPENDIX II: RESEARCH DESIGN
Records Check
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) has contacted the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the state repository for site records,
to determine if previously recorded sites are present in the project area. No sites
were found to be in the path of the water line or at the site of the deep well, pump
station, and elevated storage tank. In addition, a review of relevant
archaeological reports will be conducted.
Project Description
The Woodrow-Osceola WSC wants to install water line within rural
portions of Hill County, Texas. In addition to the water line, a deep well, pump
station, and elevated storage tank are planned. They will be constructed on a
one-acre tract. The water line will be placed on private property. However,
consideration will be given to use of the highway right-of-way if necessary. The
water lines will have a cover of 36” to 42”. The lines will be installed using a
backhoe. The diameter of the water line will be between 6” and 8”. The width of
the trench will be 24”, and the easement will be 15’. The deep well, pump station,
and elevated storage tank will be placed within a one-acre tract.
Survey Methods
The Principal Investigator for this project is William E. Moore, and the Project
Archaeologist is Edward P. Baxter. No fieldwork will commence until an Antiquities
Permit has been issued for this project. The high probability areas selected for
survey were identified after two tasks.
•

The Principal Investigator reviewed the topographic maps

•

The Principal Investigator drove the entire project area and checked the
maps against actual field conditions.

RESEARCH DESIGN - (PAGE TWO)
The survey crew will dig shovel probes to test for soil depth above the
Pleistocene clay. Shovel probes differ from shovel tests in that the excavated soil is
not screened, and the location of the probes are not typically depicted on the
project area map. When sandy soil is encountered, shovel tests will be excavated.
These tests will adequately cover the area and will be dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels.
All excavated dirt will be passed through ¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will
be dug to the underlying clay subsoil when possible and to depths of about 100 cm
in sandy areas when clay is not reached. The size of certain tests may be
expanded to allow for deeper investigation if needed in order to examine the depth
of the APE. Artifacts found in shovel tests will be collected and analyzed in the
laboratory prior to curation or submission to the landowner. When a site is found,
an attempt to determine its boundaries through shovel testing and surface
inspection will be made, and all diagnostic artifacts observed on the surface will be
collected.
The soil survey will be consulted to determine the potential for alluvial clays.
When present, backhoe trenches may be necessary to examine the APE in these
areas.
All sites found in the project area will be mapped. The site map will depict
the shovel tests (positive and negative). GPS plottings will be taken to more
accurately plot sites on the proper USGS topographic map. All archaeological sites
will be assigned a field number. Later, an official trinomial will be assigned by
TARL. Future references to these sites will use the TARL number. The number of
shovel tests will meet or exceed that number requested in the Minimum Survey
Standards for projects of 200 acres or less.
The pre-survey assessment found no floodplain areas suitable for backhoe
trenching. The survey will examine creek crossings that are believed to contain
alluvial clay soils, as backhoe trenching in these areas may be necessary.
The field assessment observed no historic sites within the proposed
easements. One cemetery is near the project area. The route of the water line will
be evaluated in terms of any possible impact on this historic site.
The entire project will be documented through digital photography, a handheld GPS, forms, and field notes.

RESEARCH DESIGN – PAGE THREE
Artifact Analysis
All significant artifacts will be collected for analysis in the laboratory. They
will be described and measured. All artifacts not viewed as containing research
potential for future researchers will be discarded following a written document
authorizing this action from the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division
or returned to the landowner if found on private property.
Report Preparation
A report documenting this project will be prepared following the guidelines
established by the CTA and THC. The style of this report will generally follow
that adopted by American Antiquity.
Two copies of the draft report will be submitted to the THC for review. A
discussion of the project and recommendations for future work will be included.
Following acceptance of this report, 20 copies will be submitted to the THC per
the requirements of the Antiquities Permit. No site-specific information will be
present in the 17 copies designed for the general public.
