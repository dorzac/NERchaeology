A Presentation on Stonehenge
To be Given at February 28th CVAS
Meeting

February 23 Field Trip to the
Eisenwine Ranch

Dr. Christine Buckstead will present a
program on Stonehenge and Prehistoric Britain on February 28. Christine is Assistant
Professor of Music at Angelo State University
teaching applied voice lessons and directing
the Opera and Music Theater Workshop. This
is her second year in San Angelo. She became
interested in history and archeology in the
fourth grade during a unit on Egyptian mummies, but only became actively involved
since finishing school a few years ago.
Last summer Christine and her dad visited England and Wales. This presentation
will focus on three important prehistoric sites
located in southern England. Stonehenge, one
of the most recognized Neolithic monuments
in the world, is surrounded by hundreds of
burial mounds and other ceremonial sites. Often associated (erroneously) with the Druids,
it is a marvel of engineering, believed to be a
solar observatory and temple. Two other
popular sites in the area include Avebury, a
small village near Stonehenge that was built
partly within a large stone circle, and
scratched into the chalky soil of the Salisbury
Plain is the White Horse of Uffington.

A field trip is set for February 23rd
to the Eisenwine Ranch located south of
Pecos, Texas.
Plans are to survey both sides of
Toyah Creek seeking evidence of Spanish
explorer Antonio de Espejo’s camp where
he met with a group of Jumano Indians in
1583.
This field trip will be in conjunction
with the Iraan Archeological Society. The
meeting point will be in the small town of
Verhalen at 9 AM, which is on highway 17,
between Balmorhea and Pecos.
Highway 17 runs from Pecos to Balmorhea. The Ranch is somewhere in the
middle, between I-20 and I-10. For those of
you coming in on I-20, Pecos will be the
closest. The Iraan folks come in on I-10
and stay at Balmorhea State Park, where
there are campgrounds and cabins. It is
more scenic than Pecos, being at the foot of
the Davis Mountains. Balmorhea is a very
small town with limited facilities.

Rock Art and Ruins
on the San Juan River
From Tommy Deering

Friends and colleagues: Despite the very
well publicized case of Kennewick Man, productive cooperation between Native Americans and
archaeologists does in fact occur on a regular basis. An important example of such cooperation
is described by Kuwoot yas.ein: His Spirit Is
Looking Out from the Cave, the latest video feature on our nonprofit streaming-media Web site,
The Archaeology Channel (http://
www.archaeologychannel.org).
After the discovery of 10,000 year old human remains in On Your Knees Cave on Prince
of Wales Island, Alaska, a unique partnership
formed among the Tongass National Forest, scientists and Alaska Native tribes to learn about
this ancient person. The groups, brought together through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, worked to unravel
the secrets of the early man and learn from each
other. After this film production, DNA analysis
from these remains produced strong evidence of
early human coastal migration into the Americas.
This and other programs are available on
TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you

programs. Only with your help can we continue
and enhance our nonprofit public-education and
visitor-supported programming. We also welcome new content partners as we reach out to the
world community.

The website below has some fantastic
photos of Rock Art and ruins on the San
Juan river in Utah. This man is a river runner and excellent photographer. He has
photos on over 20 trips that he has taken
since 2003. The trips listed under San Juan
are the ones with the Rock Art and ruins and
he has compiled most of the Rock Art on
the Art, 05-06 link and ruins under the Ruins, 05-06 link. There are also Rock
Art and Ruins photos on the other links under San Juan. The other rivers listed have
great photos of the canyons that they went
through as well as day hikes they made up
side canyons.

Rattlesnake Shelter Pictograph Tour
March 21-23, 2008

Drawing by Forrest Kirkland from The Rock Art of Texas Indians

Sign Up
Sign up sheets for tours will be in the interpretive center/office at Seminole Canyon
State Park. Meet Texas Tech representative at the Seminole Canyon Center at 8 AM for a morning tour, or 1 PM for an afternoon tour. Sign 2 liability release forms and make $25 donation
($5 for students) (cash or check payable to Texas Tech University).
Travel
Participants are responsible for their own transportation. Carpooling is encouraged
to reduce the number of vehicles involved as much as possible. Tours will depart at 8:30 AM
and 1:30 PM from the Seminole Canyon Center parking lot. If you are not with the guided
group, you will not be able to get in.
Drive to Langtry on Hwy. 90 (ca. 20 miles). From Langtry, there is a short drive west on
Hwy. 90. We will then enter a private ranch through a locked gate and travel about 3.5 miles on
a rough gravel road. Ranch road is slow and dusty, but 4-wheel is not required. However, your
vehicle needs to have high clearance. The group should be back at Seminole Canyon in about
3 hours.
Difficulty The hike to Rattlesnake Shelter is moderately strenuous. The round-trip walking distance is about 1 mile involving going into and coming out of the canyon on unimproved
trails. We will be in a remote location where response to serious injuries and medical emergencies will be difficult.
Clothing Sturdy hiking boots, long pants, and a hat are recommended.
Restrooms The closest public restrooms are at the Judge Roy Bean Center in Langtry.
Bring
A quart or two of drinking water, camera, walking stick, bug repellent, etc.
Don't Bring Firearms. Pets. Alcohol.

Red
Rock
Ranch. Participants should be in good

with supplemental information on the art of Trans Pecos
Texas.
A
practical session will provide participants with an understanding of the
techniques used to record rock art.
The Rock Art
Academy will be held in the Van Horn Convention Center – parking
