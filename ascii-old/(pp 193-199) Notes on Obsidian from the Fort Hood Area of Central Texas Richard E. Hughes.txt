Notes on Obsidian from the Fort Hood Area of
Central Texas
Richard E. Hughes
ABSTRACT
Nondestructive energ~ dispersive x-ray fluorescence analyses were performed on two obsidian artifacts from the Fort Hood area of Bell and Coryell
counties in Central Texas. These studies showed that the obsidian came from
two different sources in southwestern and north central New Mexico.
INTRODUCTION

The presence of obsidian in Texas archeological sites has evoked comment
for more than half a century (e.g. Studer 1931; Ray 1935). Although obsidian
has not been found in great abundance at any archeological site in the state,
speculation on the parent geological sources has had a long history (see Krieger
1947, Newell and Krieger 1949:160). Today, however, it is no longer necessary
to speculate, because sophisticated measurement techniques developed in the
physical sciences (i.e. x-ray fluorescence and neutron activation) can be used to
detect the geochemical composition of obsidian artifacts. First, the minor, trace,
and rare earth element compositions of obsidian sources are measured to construct an elemental "profile" for each source. The corresponding elemental profiles, or "fingerprints," of particular artifacts are then generated and compared
with profiles of obsidian samples from known geologic sources to determine the
most likely origin for each artifact. This procedure, sometimes known as fingerprinting or obsidian-sourcing research, has been pursued steadily in Texas for
more than a decade (e.g. Hester and Mitchell 1974, Hester et al. 1975, 1980,
1986; Hester, Asaro, and Stross 1980; 1982, Mitchell et al. 1980). Consequently, despite the relative rarity of obsidian in the state, comparatively more is
known about its prehistoric distribution in Texas than currently is known about
distributions in adjacent areas that are richly endowed with natural deposits of
volcanic glass. This paper reports the results of the analysis of two obsidian
artifacts from the Fort Hood area and offers some brief comparisons with
previous sourcing research in Central Texas.
THE SAMPLES

The two obsidian artifacts studied here were recovered from two archeological sites---one (site 560) in Coryell County, within the boundaries of the U.S.
Army’s Fort Hood Military Installation, the other (41BL59) in Bell County near
Morgan’s Point (Figure 1).
A small, concave-base projectile point (Figure, 2, a) (Cat. no. 86-1005) was

recovered in Coryell County at site 560 in Fort Hood on the surface of a terrace
that overlooks Owl Creek. The site also contained Baird, Bulverde, and Wells
type dart points (Briuer, personal communication), but the shape and size of this
specimen suggest that it is either a Fresno or Maud type arrowpoint. This
particular specimen is slightly smaller than illustrated Fresno and Maud points
(cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plates 137, 141): its shallow basal concavity is somewhat greater than those of illustrated Fresno points, yet less extreme than on the
Maud examples. Despite this classification ambiguity, the overall morphological attributes of the point suggest that it probably was manufactured no earlier
than A.D. 1000 and no later than A.D. 1800 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:273,281).
The other specimen (Figure, 2, b) is an obsidian biface fragment (Cat. no.
86-1006) recovered by avocationalists from excavations at site 41BL59 along
Cedar Creek at Morgan’s Point in Bell County. Briuer (personal communication) indicated that the obsidian flake was associated with Perdiz and Cliffton
points and Leon Plain pottery, below historic material, but above late Archaic
deposits (including Ensor and Montell projectile points). Although the morphological attributes of this artifact provide no clues as to its age, if the specimen
was associated with these points and pottery, it would date from about A.D.
1200 to 1500 (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:95,269,283).
ANALYTICAL METHOD
Laboratory analyses on these artifacts were performed on a SpectraceTM
5000 (Tracor X-ray) energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer equipped

with a rhodium (Rh) x-ray tube, a 50 kV x-ray generator, and a lithium-drifted
silicon solid state detector with 150 eV resolution (FWHM) at 5.9 keV in a 30
mm2 area. The analysis technique is completely nondestructive; no part of the
specimen was powdered or otherwise altered. The only sample preparation
undertaken before analysis was a simple rinsing in distilled water to remove
possible surface contaminants. Technical details of the analyses (e.g. primary
beam filter selection, calibration) appear in Hughes (n.d.), but operating conditions for the x-ray tube were similar to those reported elsewhere (Hughes
1986a, b).
RESULTS
Trace element concentration values for these two artifacts (Table 1) show
that whereas titanium (Ti), iron (Fe), rubidium (Rb), strontium (Sr), and yttrium
(Y) are similar in both specimens, their manganese (Mn), zirconium (Zr), niobium (Nb) and barium (Ba) values are quite different, indicating that two
distinct geochemical varieties of obsidian are represented. Comparison of these
trace element values with those generated from parent obsidian sources to the
west (Baugh and Nelson 1987, Hughes 1988, Nelson 1984, Newman and Nielsen
1985), the north, (i.e., Malad, Idaho; Hughes 1984:Table 3, Hester et al. 1986),
and south (Hester et al. 1985:Table 1) indicates that both specimens were
fashioned from obsidian originating in New Mexico.
Specifically, the projectile point from Fort Hood site 560 in Coryell County
matches the trace element profile of Mule Creek obsidian from southwestern
New Mexico (see Hughes 1988), indicating that obsidian from this source was
more widely distributed than previously believed (see Findlow and Bolognese
1982a, 1982b). To the author’s knowledge, this is only the second report of
Mule Creek obsidian in Texas; the first reported specimen was from a site in

McMuUen County south of San Antonio (Hester and Mitchell 1974), even
farther from the source than the Fort Hood specimen.
The obsidian biface fragment from site 41BL59 conforms to the fingerprint
of Obsidian Ridge glass from the Jemez Mountains volcanic field in northern
New Mexico. In reporting on obsidian sourcing analyses from Hutchinson and
Roberts counties, Texas, Mitchell and his co-workers (Mitchell et al. 1980:304,
305) identified an obsidian type they termed (following R. N. Jack’s suggestion)
"High Nb" obsidian, and tentatively suggested that the geographic source counterpart for this group was somewhere in the Valles Caldera, west of Santa Fe, New
Mexico. Specimen 86-1006 from Fort Hood contains a high amount of Nb
(about 92 ppm), and its Rb, Sr, and Zr composition also agrees with the High Nb
profile (Mitchell et al. 1980:Table 1). Recent geochemical analyses conducted
on obsidians from northern New Mexico (e.g. Newman and Nielsen 1985,
Baugh and Nelson 1987) support Mitchell’s hypothesis that Obsidian Ridge, in
the Bandelier Tuff within the Jemez Mountains volcanic field, which circumscribes the Valles Caldera (see Smith and Bailey 1966), is probably the source
for the High Nb group.
