ABSTRACT

Dr. Grady Niblo, Jr., bequeathed the headquarters area of the Niblo Farm to the City of Dallas for
use as a city park following his death in 2005. The City of Dallas requested a cultural resources
investigation of the property as part of the master plan for future development of the park.
Quimby McCoy Preservation Architecture, LLP, of Dallas was contracted to prepare the master
plan for the park. Geo-Marine, Inc., of Plano, Texas, was then subcontracted to perform an
archeological evaluation of the property and to perform oral interviews with the Niblo family.
The cultural resources investigations at the Niblo Farm, site 41DL352, were performed from
March 19–27, 2008, and consisted of the judgmental excavation of 50-x-50-centimeter units near
the standing buildings to determine the presence of cultural deposits and a pedestrian survey in
the surrounding woods to determine if any additional features were present. A main goal of the
archeological investigation was to determine if any isolable nineteenth-century deposits existed.
Although small quantities of nineteenth-century materials were recovered, they were mixed with
later materials. This mixing was exacerbated by the thin AC soil deposits found across most of
the site, where clay loam deposits of less than 35 centimeters in depth overlay limestone bedrock,
precluding definitive cultural temporal associations. The 10 features at the site consist of five
standing buildings, a hand-dug well, a root cellar, a concrete pump box, a concrete foundation,
and a large earthen berm. Two of the features (the log cabin and timber barn) date to the
nineteenth century, and the hand-dug well and root cellar are also most likely associated with the
nineteenth-century occupation. The remaining structures and features appear to date to the
twentieth century.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The Niblo Farm (site 41DL352) is situated in southwestern Dallas County on the edge of the
escarpment overlooking Spur 408 to the west and Artesian Creek to the south (Figure 1). In
2005, Dr. Grady Niblo, Jr., bequeathed the headquarters area of the Niblo Farm to the City of
Dallas for use as a city park, with his wife retaining a life tenancy on the property. The City of
Dallas requested a cultural resources investigation of the property as part of the master plan for
future development of the park. Quimby McCoy Preservation Architecture, LLP, (Quimby
McCoy) of Dallas was contracted to prepare the master plan for the park and to prepare plans for
stabilizing the standing structures. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas, was then
subcontracted to perform a cultural resources evaluation of the property (GMI project number
30573.00.01). The results of these investigations are described in this report. The collections
generated during this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin. Because the city is a subentity of the State of
Texas, an Antiquities Permit (# 4516) was obtained prior to conducting fieldwork.
The cultural resources investigations were undertaken between March 19 and March 27, 2008, by
Steven Hunt (Field Supervisor) and Bethany Oliver of GMI. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served
as Principal Investigator for the project. Joshua Sales of GMI undertook the mapping of the site
using GPS and provided GIS support for the project. Jessica Williams conducted the archival
research for the project. Sharlene Allday served as Technical Editor for the report, and Denise
Pemberton coordinated the report production.
The Niblo Farm consists of a cleared area within a chain link fence that contained the unoccupied
standing structures, the currently occupied house (a new log cabin-type residence) adjacent to the
fence, and a densely wooded area surrounding the structures (Figures 2–5). The graveled
driveway is east of the existing house and stops at the north wall of the unoccupied original
nineteenth-century log cabin. Two features were discovered in the densely wooded area east of
the structures: a concrete foundation and an earthen berm. These two features appear to be
associated, although their function is as yet not understood.

In all, 20 50-x-50-centimetere (cm) units were excavated at the site. The majority of these units
exhibited a thin AC soil horizon. The loamy clay A horizon was at most 30 cm deep, but
frequently shallower, and directly overlaid the limestone C horizon. An AB horizon was
encountered at the north end of the site in Units 9, 18, and 19.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

FLORA AND FAUNA
Dallas County is part of the Texan biotic province, defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces, and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. Almost all of Dallas County falls within the Blackland Prairie, one of
several tall grass prairies present in this northcentral part of Texas. Blackland Prairie vegetation
is dominated by uplands grasses; woodlands are restricted to stream courses and river bottoms.
Prior to the disturbances associated with the historic period, the wooded areas would have been
covered by a water-oak/elm/hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water
marshes and ponds (McMahan et al. 1984). Today, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm,
American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash,
sycamore, pecan, bois d’arc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, and coral-berry. Among the grasses
expected to occur within the prairie setting are little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
dallisgrass, hairgrama switchgrass, rescuegrass, bermudagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Torrey silver bluestem, eastern gramagrass, Virginia wildrye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, and yankeeweed (Coffee et al. 1980:50, 92).
The faunal community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Among the wildlife that would have previously inhabited the
region would have been open land species (bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow,
cottontail, and red fox), woodland species (wild turkey, ruffled grouse, woodcock, thrushes,
woodpeckers, squirrel, gray fox, raccoon, and deer), wetland inhabitants (ducks, geese, heron,
shore birds, muskrat, mink, and beaver), and rangeland species (antelope, deer, sage grouse,
meadowlark, and lark bunting), along with various species of reptiles (Coffee et al. 1980:50;
Schmidly 1983).

7

CLIMATE
The Dallas area has a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid climate. Although the climate is
generally mild, summers are hot, and the winters are cool as a result of surges of cold air. The
average summer temperatures range between 84°F and 94°F; the highest recorded temperature of
111°F occurred in the summer of 1954. Winter temperature averages range between 38°F and
48°F, but the lowest recorded temperature of 7°F occurred in February 1971. Temperature
remains above 32°F approximately 240 days each year. The yearly rainfall of 36 inches is fairly
evenly distributed, but the maximum falls in April and May and the minimum in August. Much
of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy thunderstorms, and the rapid runoff allows only partial
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall, which is rare, averages less that 2 inches per year and
is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds are from the south (Coffee et al.
1980:1–2).
SOILS
The location of Dallas County in the Blackland Prairie places it geologically in the Texas Gulf
Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by a generally level topography and soils of
dark, thick, plastic clay. The project area is underlain by the Cretaceous age Austin Chalk (BEG
1972). The project area is mapped at the juncture of the Eddy-Stephen-Austin and Ferris-Heiden
soil associations.
The U.S Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has mapped four soils in
the project area: Eddy clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Eddy clay loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes;
Eddy-Stephen complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes; and Austin-Lewisville complex, 5 to 8 percent
slopes, eroded. Eddy clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is a very shallow to shallow and welldrained soil that overlays the Austin Chalk. The surface layer is grayish brown and moderately
alkaline clay loam about 13 cm (5 inches [in]) thick. The next layer is platy soft chalky limestone
and grayish brown clay loam about 28 cm (11 in) thick. Under this is the white soft chalky
limestone bedrock (Coffee et al. 1980:20).
The Eddy clay loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes, differs from the Eddy clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes,
in that the surface layer is about 10 cm (4 in) thick. The second layer remains 28 cm (11 in) thick
and is underlain by the limestone bedrock (Coffee et al. 1980:20–21).
Eddy-Stephen complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes, is a shallow to very shallow, well-drained soil that
forms above the Austin Chalk. It is composed of approximately 60 percent Eddy soil and 30
percent Stephen soil, with the remainder consisting of small areas of other soils too small to be
accurately mapped. The representative Eddy soil profile begins with a dark grayish brown,
gravelly clay loam about 13 cm (5 in) thick. This is underlain by a dark grayish brown, very
gravelly clay loam from 12 to 28 cm (5–15 in) below surface, and chalky limestone bedrock
below 28 cm. Stephen soils begin with a surface layer of dark grayish brown silty clay about 20
cm (8 in) deep, underlain by brown silty clay from 20 to 36 cm (8–14 in) below surface.
Limestone bedrock is found below 36 cm (Coffee et al. 1980:20, 22, 59).
The Austin-Lewisville complex, 5 to 8 percent slopes, eroded, consists of moderately deep to
deep, well-drained soils that form on the walls and flood plains of sloping, narrow creek valleys.
Austin soils occupy about 50 percent of the map unit, and Lewisville soils make up another 30
8

percent. The remaining 20 percent is composed of other soil types too small to accurately map.
Austin series soils begin with a very dark grayish brown clay approximately 15 cm (6 in) deep
containing many fine chalk fragments. This is underlain by a dark brown silty clay from 15 to 51
cm (6–20 in) below surface. Below this is a platy chalk or soft limestone bedrock. Lewisville
soils begin with a dark grayish brown silty clay approximately 48 cm (19 in) deep. Small
quantities of soft limestone fragments and snails are found in the surface layer. This is underlain
by a light grayish brown silty clay from 48 to 168 cm (19–66 in) below surface. The platy chalk
bedrock is found below 168 cm (Coffee et al. 1980:13).

CULTURAL SETTING

PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Investigations at
Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the
chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. However, the prehistoric chronological
framework will not be presented here, as this project concerns the mid-nineteenth-century to midtwentieth-century historic occupation of this area.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Dallas County
The Anglo-American period in Dallas County began in 1841, when John Neely Bryan settled
along the Trinity River. Bryan initially intended to establish an Indian trading post, but the May
1841 Battle of Village Creek resulted in the expulsion of Native American groups from the
11

region. As a result, Bryan was forced to change his plans and decided to start a settlement
instead. He invited the residents of Bird’s Fort, in present-day Tarrant County, to join his new
settlement, and several, including John Beeman, Captain Mabel Gilbert, Tom Keenan, and Isaac
B. Webb, decided to join him (Handbook of Texas Online 2008a; Works Progress Administration
[WPA] 1992:38–40).
Also in 1841, the Texas Emigration Land Company contracted with the Republic of Texas to
bring 600 families into Northcentral Texas. The contract for this effort, known as the Peters
Colony, was renegotiated on two separate occasions and eventually encompassed portions of
Dallas, Denton, Cooke, Collin, Grayson, Ellis, and Wise counties; however, the main focus of the
colony was in northern Dallas and southern Denton and Collin counties. The colonization effort
was unsuccessful, because the company was unable to attract sufficient numbers of colonists to
meet the terms of the contract. Extravagant claims about the region in company literature,
inadequate support, and maladministration led to a growing rift between the Texas Emigration
Land Company and colonists, culminating in 1852 when colonists seized the company’s records
and ejected their local agent (Handbook of Texas Online 2008b; WPA 1992:40).
Dallas County, initially part of Nacogdoches County, was formed by the state legislature as a
separate entity in 1846. A competition between Dallas, Hord’s Ridge, and Cedar Spring for the
honor of becoming the county seat was resolved in an 1850 election. In 1850, the population of
Dallas County was 2,743 people (including 208 slaves), but by 1860 had risen to 8,665 (including
1,074 slaves and 228 slave owners). During the Antebellum period, Dallas County was
overwhelmingly rural and self-sufficient, relying on the major crops of corn and wheat, together
with cattle-, sheep-, and hog-raising (Handbook of Texas Online 2008c).
In 1860, Dallas County voted for secession. Ten companies, comprising 1,300 men, were
organized for service in the Confederate Army. In general, Dallas County profited from the Civil
War. The Confederacy established a general quartermasters and commissary headquarters, and
the Tucker Sherrod and Company pistol factory was established in Lancaster. Northcentral Texas
was never invaded by the Union Army, and as a result, slave owners with their slaves immigrated
to the region. The economic malaise felt elsewhere in the South largely bypassed Dallas County,
whose population grew from 8,665 in 1860 to 13,414 in 1870 (Handbook of Texas Online 2008c).
Dallas’s early growth was hindered by a poor transportation network. The Trinity River proved
largely unnavigable, and it was not until the Houston and Texas Central Railroad reached Dallas
in 1872 that the county gained fast, cheap, and reliable communication with the outside world.
Other railroads soon followed, and by 1885, five railroad lines crossed Dallas County. The
integration into national markets allowed manufacturing and commerce to become more
important in regional economy. As an industry, agriculture peaked in the first two decades of the
twentieth century: cotton and livestock production declined after 1900, and wheat and oats
peaked in 1920. The number of farms also peaked in 1920, when 5,379 existed in the county.
This process continued throughout the twentieth century. By 1950, 89.8 percent of the county
was considered urban, and the U.S. Census Bureau included the entire county in the Dallas
Metropolitan Statistical Area (Handbook of Texas Online 2008c).

Duncanville Vicinity
Early settlers were attracted to the area by the Cedar Mountains (now known as the White Rock
Escarpment), a line of prominent, cedar-covered crags found in the western part of Dallas and
Ellis counties. The area received its name from a perceived resemblance of the landform to a
mountain range. Part of the attraction of such regions may have been due to recommendations by
early commentators, who recommended areas with plentiful timber and small streams, and who
denigrated settling on the surrounding prairies (City of Duncanville 2008; Handbook of Texas
Online 2008d; Moir 1988:19).
Development of the city of Duncanville began in 1845 when Crawford Trees purchased several
thousand acres in the region. In 1855, Mr. Trees donated the land for the Little Bethel Male and
Female School, which was also used as a church for many years. Other early settlers in the area
were the Kimmel, Merrifield, Hustead, Carr, Wilson, and Ramsay families. These early settlers
then recommended that friends and family join them, encouraging further growth in the region
(City of Duncanville 2008; Handbook of Texas Online 2008d; Moir 1988:19–20).
However, a true community did not begin to develop until after the Chicago, Texas, and Mexican
Railroad was constructed through the area in 1881. One of the features along the new railroad
was a switching station called Duncan’s Switch, named after one of the line foreman. In 1881,
Charles Nance used the recently constructed railroad to visit his sister who lived near Duncan’s
Switch. Liking what he saw of the area, Nance opened a general store at Duncan’s Switch and
applied to the government to open a post office. The original application with the name Duncan
was denied because there was already a Duncan, Texas, post office in Jasper County, so Nance
altered the application to Duncanville and the application was approved. A business district soon
began to develop in Duncanville, with a railroad depot built in 1883, and other early businesses
such as a cotton gin, a doctor’s office, and another general store (City of Duncanville 2008;
Handbook of Texas Online 2008d).
Duncanville continued a slow but steady growth pattern in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. In 1904, 113 people lived in Duncanville, growing to over 300 by 1930. In order to
prevent being annexed by their neighbors in Dallas, Duncanville incorporated as a 225-acre city
in 1947. Duncanville became a Dallas suburb in the middle twentieth century, with the
population growing from 5,000 in 1962 to 13,000 in 1970. The period of explosive population
growth ended during the 1980s. The population in 1988 was over 31,000 and had only grown to
36,081 by 2000 (Handbook of Texas Online 2008d).
Niblo Farm History
The Niblo Farm is located in the E. Sharrock, Jr., 1315 headright. Unfortunately, the early
documents relating to this property were not located; however, a summary is provided in an 1867
deed. The property was “patented to Thomas J. Young Assignee of Everard Sharock Jurn
[sic] . . . by virtue of Certificate No. 3 issued by Thos. W. Ward Commissioner of Peters Colony
on the 1st day of April 1850 and transferred to Thomas J. Young by said Sharock [sic] on 14th day
of November 1853” (Dallas County 1867). Everard Sharrock, Jr. (1826–1913), and other
members of the Sharrock family moved to the Dallas area from Ohio in 1845 and received Peters
Colony land grants. Sharrock left Dallas County for California in 1853, where his wife and
youngest son died in 1854 (James 2004). It is unclear from the 1867 deed whether Sharrock ever
13

occupied the property. The description of Thomas J. Young as the assignee of Everard Sharrock,
Jr., suggests that Sharrock never took possession of the property, but this theory does not explain
why there should be an 1853 transfer between Sharrock and Young.
In 1867, the 320-acre property was sold by Thomas J. and Rebbeca K. Young to Andrew A.
Young for the sum of $600 (Dallas County 1867). In 1881, Andrew A. and Alice Young sold the
entire property to H. K. and G. P Hale for $2,100. The Youngs’ are listed as living in Coleman
County, Texas (Dallas County 1881). The ca. 1900 Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County, Texas,
shows the Niblo Farm as being owned by B. P. Hale (Figure 1x; note that the Street map has the
headright spelling of Sharrock as “Sarrock”). In 1903, B. P. and Sarah Hale sold the
southernmost 100 acres of the Sharrock headright to W. P. Hale for $400 (Dallas County 1903).
This document further mentions that property was deeded to B. P. Hale by H. K. Gergin and G. I.
Hale, but the text is unclear and references Deed Record Volume 74, page 2165, but
unfortunately, Volume 74 was missing at the time of the archival research. By 1928, the property
was in the hands of the Boren Stewart Company, who sold it to William A. Sailer (Dallas County
1928). In 1934, two adjacent, 100-acre tracts were sold by William A. Sailer and Norman
Hamilton to Joe C. Thompson and Grady Niblo for $1 and assumption of half of the debt owed
on these properties (Dallas County 1934). These properties became the Grady Niblo farm and
remained in the family until the death of Dr. Grady Niblo, Jr., in 2005, when the farm
headquarters was transferred to the City of Dallas (Dallas County 2006).

METHODS

The cultural resources investigations at the Niblo Farm consisted of excavating 20 judgmentally
placed test units and conducting a pedestrian survey in the wooded area to determine if any
additional features were present. The test units were 50-x-50 cm in size and were dug in 10-cm
arbitrary levels to bedrock or through two sterile levels. Each level was recorded on standardized
forms following excavation. The soils excavated from the units were processed through 6.35millimeter (mm) hardware cloth screens. The collected artifacts were placed in plastic zip lock
bags. A few categories of artifacts (primarily thin iron fragments without diagnostic elements)
were not collected, but were returned to the excavation units.
The pedestrian survey was conducted along transects at 10-meter (m) intervals in the wooded
areas surrounding the site. Four transects were walked east of the chain link fence, and two
transects were walked on the north and west sides of the chain link fence. Any features
discovered during the pedestrian survey were marked with flagging tape for later mapping.
The site was mapped using a Trimble XRS GPS system. The GPS coordinates were later
integrated with existing basemaps using ArcGIS 9.2 software. Digital photography was used to
document the excavations and the features discovered. All photographs taken were recorded on
standardized forms.
The artifacts collected were returned to the GMI offices in Plano, where they were washed in
preparation for analysis. The historic artifact analysis was conducted by Steven Hunt and Melissa
Green. Faunal analysis was undertaken by Clayton Tinsley. All materials collected or generated
by this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin.
FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
The analysis of the historic material was based on the classification system developed by South
(1977). The classification system consists of four major analytical categories or classes of
identifiable artifacts. Unidentifiable metal, glass, and ceramic fragments that are unclassifiable as
to one of the four major categories are placed in a minor “Indeterminate” category. The four
major categories encompass the following:
17

1.
2.
3.
4.

Domestic
Architectural
Personal
Activities

Major artifact categories were divided into various subcategories (e.g., tableware, food storage,
and furnishings within the Domestic category). The subcategories were then divided into various
classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the type of subcategory and material type. In the case
of ceramics and glass, these subtypes were associated with manufacture or use dates whenever
possible; dates can often cover wide ranges. The general nature of each of the major artifact
categories is discussed below, and the detailed results of analysis are presented in Appendix A.
Domestic Artifacts
The Domestic category included artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumed some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares included stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items were identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g.,
nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and were assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items or storagewares were also subdivided as to whether they were ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items were further subdivided into types and
subtypes using technological and decorative attributes, such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., salt glazed, Alkaline glazed, Bristol slipped, cobalt
decorated, Albany and/or other natural clay slipped) and interior treatment (e.g., glazed, Bristol
slipped, Albany or other natural clay slipped, unglazed). These attributes formed the basis for
assigning production dates to individual specimens.
Glass storageware was subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base); and
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded) or sometimes function
(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). An individual item was
given an artifact-specific date based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination.
The Furnishings subcategory included all nonfood service or nonfood storage household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The Furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historic artifact assemblage from rural sites, and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
Furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass.
Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the Domestic
category. In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the Architectural or Activities
categories.
18

Architectural Artifacts
The Architectural category included all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of Architectural items included such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails were further subdivided as to
whether they were wrought, cut, or wire; and the brick was distinguished as to whether it was
handmade, machine-made, or high-fired.
Personal Artifacts
The Personal category included items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historic archeological sites.
Activities Artifacts
The Activities category of historic artifacts relates to all nonhousehold items, such as those
associated with transportation activities, weaponry, and farm-related equipment. As with
Personal category items, this category often makes up only a small proportion of the overall
assemblage of identifiable historic artifacts from a site. Activities category items include
truck/tractor/wagon parts, harness buckles, fence staples, fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe
nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for Activities items include tools, harness and
equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons, and coal.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS
Initially, recovered animal bone material was evaluated as either identifiable (i.e., relatively
intact) or unidentifiable (i.e., highly fragmented) remains. Whole bone and fragments that
possessed sufficient landmark and identifiable traits are identified as to anatomical element (e.g.,
femur, pelvis) and/or portion of elements (e.g., proximal, medial, distal) and assigned to genus
and species, wherever possible. In the case of unidentified elements, the thickness and curvature
of bones allows the analyst to assign the specimens to general animal size-classes ranging from
very small (mice, mole, and microtine), through small mammal (rat, squirrel, etc.), medium-sized
mammal (coyote, bobcat, puma, etc.), to large animal (deep, antelope, etc.) and very large animal
(bison, elk, etc.). The represented side of the animal (left, right, axial) is recorded when possible,
or noted as unidentified. Probable cultural information is collected on the burned condition of
bone (unburned, partially carbonized, carbonized, partially calcined, calcined). For each of these
above classes, a count of the number of specimens (NSP) is made. A Comments section of the
database allows for observations on butcher marks, carnivore damage, and other general
observations.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The following chapter presents the results of the cultural resources investigations. In order to
maintain compatibility with previous work, the names used for the structures on topographic map
prepared by Quimby McCoy are retained in this discussion.
PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The pedestrian survey was conducted in the densely wooded areas around the fenced structures in
order to determine if any undiscovered features or dumps associated with the structures existed in
these areas. The pedestrian survey was conducted at 10-m-transect intervals in the areas
immediately east, west, and north of the chain link fence. The survey was geared toward
discovering surficial remains and thus no shovel testing was undertaken. The area east of the
chain link fence proved to have the densest concentration of material. Many artifacts—such as
small metal drums, large pieces of metal pipe, beer bottles, a glass insulator, sheet metal, tin cans,
concrete pipe, a refrigerator, a hay mower, and a pump—were noted on the surface, and all
indicate the twentieth-century occupation. In addition, two features (a concrete foundation and an
earthen berm) were discovered and are described in greater detail below.
The pump was found on the ground surface about 3 m west of the concrete foundation. Given the
proximity between the pump and concrete foundation, the two items may be associated. The
pump is marked “BAKER / POWER PUMP/HELLER-ALLER CO. / NAPOLEON OHIO /
MOD E1” (Figure 7). Heller-Aller & Company was started in 1886 to build windmills and other
water supply equipment and incorporated in 1904 as Heller-Aller Company (City of Spearman
2008). It is still in business making hand- and windmill-operated pumps as a division of Hitzer,
Inc. (Hitzer, Inc., 2008).
In addition, portions of five fence lines were discovered east of the chain link fence (see Figure
3). Three of these fence lines were found in the area surrounding Unit 13. One fence is oriented
north/south along the edge of the clearing west of Unit 13. Only two fence posts were noted for
this fence line. Another fence line is 7 m south of Unit 13 and consists of four fence posts. Two
of the fence posts have fallen, but are in proximity to one another, and possibly represent a corner

post (Figure 8) with the third fence line. The third fence line is 7 m east of Unit 13 and consists
of two fence posts in a north/south orientation. The previously mentioned possible corner post
may be associated with this fence line.
The remaining two fence lines were found southeast of the Niblo residence. One is oriented
east/west and parallels a power line right-of-way. The second is oriented north/south, beginning
at the east-west fence line and extending to the south, parallel with the Niblo driveway. A water
faucet enclosed in a piece of ceramic sewer pipe (Figure 9) was found at the corner of these fence
lines.
Little material was found in the area north of the chain link fence. A few modern beer bottles, a
ketchup bottle, a glass insulator, tin cans, and a metal bucket, all dating to the twentieth century,
were observed on the surface. No features were discovered, and apparently it was used as a later
discard area.

The area west of the chain link fence is on the edge of the escarpment. A moderate amount of
dumping has occurred here, but it all appeared to be twentieth-century material. Beer bottles, pull
tab cans, aerosol cans, and pieces of sheet metal were intermittently discovered along much of the
escarpment. A large dump of material was found southwest of the Niblo residence, but again,
only modern materials were noted within it. A small dump (Figure 10) of tabular stones,
concrete, and brick was found along the chain link fence northeast of Unit 20, and five pieces of
cut stone were found in the woods 10 m north of Unit 20. Three features were noted in this area
(see Figure 3). A small pond was found in the woods west of the tin coop. A north/southoriented fence line, found down the slope of the escarpment, consists of three isolated fence posts
and wire running along the ground surface. Another section of fence was found parallel to the
power line right-of-way and probably constitutes a continuation of the other fence paralleling the
same power line.
EXCAVATION UNITS
In total, 20 50-x-50-cm units were excavated within the chain-link fence at the Niblo Farm. The
units were judgmentally placed near the surrounding existing structures. Bedrock was
encountered in the majority of the units (n=17) at depths varying from 9–36 cm below surface
(Table 2) and was overlain by very dark grayish brown clay loam (Figure 11).

The remaining three units (Units 9, 18, and 19) were at the northern edge of the site (see Figure 3)
and never encountered bedrock; presumably, this represents the change between the Eddy clay
loam and Austin-Lewisville complex soils. The area north of the timber barn is slightly elevated
compared to the surrounding landform and has been totally enclosed by a fence. Unit 9 was dug
5 m north of the timber barn and exhibited a unique profile for the site (Figure 12). The upper 10
cm consisted of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam that contained few limestone gravels. The
loam soil is very different from that expected based on the SCS soil mapping. Possible
explanations for this phenomena are that soil was brought into the area to use as a garden or
thatthe area served as an animal pen and the loamy soil developed in situ from the manure. The
surface layer is underlain by very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam from 10–30 cm
below surface, with many limestone gravels and cobbles consistent with the A horizon observed
elsewhere onsite. Artifacts were found only within this 10–30-cm horizon. Finally, a dark
grayish brown clay loam containing several large limestone cobbles was found between 30 cm
and 50 cm below surface. The large limestone cobbles restricted excavation to the central portion
of the unit.

Unit 18 was excavated 5 m west of the tin coop. A very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay
loam was found from 0–30 cm below surface. Large quantities of limestone gravels and cobbles
were encountered, comprising an estimated 50–75 percent of the levels by volume. A soil change
occurred at 30 cm below surface, with the soil lightening in color to dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2), clay content increasing with depth, and a decrease in the amount of limestone gravels and
cobbles (Figure 13). Artifacts were encountered only within the upper 20 cm of the unit.
Figure

Figure 13. South profile of Unit 18.

Unit 19 was dug 5 m north of the tin coop. A very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty loam was
found from 0–10 cm below surface (Figure 14). This was underlain with a dark brown (10YR
3/3) soil from 10–40 cm below surface. The soil texture began as a silty clay loam, but increased
in clay content with depth and was described as clay loam at 40 cm. Calcium carbonate
filaments, as well as a small number of sandstone gravels, were observed below 10 cm. No
artifacts were recovered below 20 cm.
The artifacts collected from the investigations totaled 294 (Table 3); detailed artifact descriptions
are presented in Appendix A. The majority of the artifacts collected are either twentieth century
in origin or are ambiguously late nineteenth/twentieth century (e.g., wire nails and clear glass
fragments). Although nine of the excavation units yielded materials considered to be associated
with the nineteenth-century occupation, this assemblage is very limited both in numbers and types
of artifacts.

The sparse artifact assemblage reflecting the nineteenth-century occupation of the site was found
in Units 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 17, 19, and 20 (Table 4; see Figure 3). These 23 artifacts consist of cut
nails (n=7), blue-tinted ironstone fragments (n=12), .22 short cartridge cases (n=2), a salt-glazed
exterior/natural clay-slipped stoneware fragment, and a handmade brick. All units with
nineteenth-century artifacts also contained twentieth-century materials that were not vertically
separable and thus not in discrete temporal contexts. This lack of context is not surprising,
considering the shallow soils observed across most of the site. Likewise, material representing
the limited nineteenth-century occupation was not horizontally isolable, although two general
clusters were noted: Units 2, 4, and 20 east and west of the log cabin in the southern area; and
Units 7, 8, 9, 13, and 19 in proximity to the log timber barn in the northeastern area (see Figure
3). The clusters were separated by units yielding exclusively twentieth-century material (i.e.,
Units 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 18). The other unit with nineteenth-century material (Unit
17) was west of the plank barn.

The majority of the 271 artifacts dating to the twentieth-century are predominantly glass (n=166),
metal (n=55), ceramics (n=18), and building material (n=13) fragments. Most of the glass
specimens are bottle or table glass fragments (n=140, dating to post-1880) of clear, Depressionera, emerald and light green, light tint, manganese/solarized, and milk glass types. A dark green
glass insulator, several pieces of window and lamp glass, and indeterminate burned fragments
comprise the remaining glass assemblage. Metal remains consist of primarily wire nails (n=36,
post-1890), along with washer, fence staple, horse shoe, machine parts, rivet, and wire fragments,
as well as bottle crown caps and tin can rims. Whiteware (n=13; primarily pure white, post-1890)
comprises the majority of the ceramics assemblage, with porcelain (one of which may be a tile
fragment) and stoneware minimally represented. Building material remains are machine-made
brick (n=10, post-1903) and concrete fragments. One small bone fragment from an unidentified
medium-sized mammal and several pieces of wood charcoal were recovered. The remaining
assemblage consists of a battery core, modern plastic fragments, a rubber shoe heel, a possible
gastrolith, and a possible piece of cut stone.
No subsurface features were noted in any of the units, nor were any concentrations of ash or
charcoal observed (aside from the several charcoal fragments in Unit 2). However, the
anomalous loamy soil noted in Unit 9 may indicate a garden or animal pen.
FEATURES
There have been two construction periods at the Niblo Farm site. The older features are the log
cabin, the well complex, the root cellar, and the timber barn. The plank barn and tin coop were
later constructions.
Log Cabin
The log cabin is 7 m east-northeast of the existing occupied house and at the southern end of the
structure area. It measures 4.4 m-x-4.4 m in size and is built of square hewn logs approximately
10 cm thick (Figure 15). Two doors are centered in the north and south sides of the building
(Figure 16). On the north side of the building, a window has been framed-in immediately west of
the door opening (Figure 17). The window has been covered with shingles on the exterior of the
building. Both cut and wire nails are present in the logs. The logs have been chinked with
concrete, and a concrete floor was poured in the interior; these are not original. A dry-laid stone
chimney is on the western side of the cabin (Figure 18). It measures 180 cm north/south by
90 cm east/west.
Well Complex
A hand-dug well, pump box, and rubble pile are immediately north of the existing house (Figure
19). The well is 180 cm in diameter (Figure 20) and the water table is currently (as of March
2008) at 4.55 m below ground surface. Although the upper part of the well shaft is round, the
bottom part of the well was excavated into a larger rectangular structure. Three zones of
construction are visible in the interior of the well (Figure 21). The upper 40 cm consist of a brick
curb that extends 35 cm above the surrounding ground surface. Both handmade and machine-

made brick were noted. Dry-laid, tabular stones were found from 40 to 80 cm below the top of
the well curb, and below this is bedrock. The bottom of the well was, for some reason, dug out as
a square larger than shaft above (Figure 22).
A black PVC pipe extends up the west side of the well, leading into a concrete box containing a
modern water pump. The pump box is made of poured concrete and measures 126 cm
north/south and 80 cm east/west (Figure 23). The walls of the pump box are 10 cm wide. The
box extends 46 cm above ground surface and is 77 cm deep in the interior.
Finally, a rubble pile is adjacent to the pump box (Figure 24).and is approximately 4 m in
diameter and an estimated 75 cm in height. The rubble is primarily tabular limestone, although
occasionally brick and concrete fragments were noted, and it is probably associated with the
excavation of the modern water pump.
Root/Storm Cellar
A root cellar is 3 m northwest of the log cabin and is covered by an earthen mound roughly 10 m
in diameter (Figure 25). The roof has collapsed, caving in a portion of the earthen mound, and
the cellar is now visible from the ground surface (Figure 26). The cellar is 2.5-x-2.5 m in size,
with walls composed of hewn bedrock. The interior of the root cellar is filled with soil and debris
(see Figure 26), presumably the result of the roof collapse.

Plank Barn
The plank barn sits on a small ridge finger north of the root cellar. It was constructed of milled
lumber and wire nails and is currently in a severe state of collapse (Figures 27 and 28). It
measures 6.4 m north/south by 6.1 m east/west (Figure 29). The western half of the barn consists
of a room with exposed studs and plank walls on the interior. The eastern side is open, covered
with a shed roof. A row of 3.5-m-long rafters dangles from the northern end of the enclosed
room, indicating that the barn was once larger (Figure 30). Aside from these rafters, little
remains of this putative extension. The barn was originally roofed using wooden shingles, which
were later covered with sheets of tin (Figure 31). A door and a window opening were noted in
the eastern wall of the enclosed room (see Figure 28), and two window openings are present in
the collapsed western wall. One feature, a capped galvanized pipe found inside a sewer pipe
section, was found west of the timber barn and is thought to represent an abandoned water faucet
(Figure 32).

Several partial fence lines were noted in the vicinity of this barn (see Figure 3). One fence line
runs east/west approximately 10 m south of the barn and is part of a larger fence that apparently
separated the barns from the house. Two fence lines were noted west of the barn. The fence
closest to the barn consisted of a small section of fence extending north from the east/west fence
line and a fence post adjacent to the barn that appeared to line up with the fence fragment. The
other fence paralleled this about 3 m west and also consisted of intact portions of fence and
isolated fence posts.
Timber Barn
The timber barn is composed of three elements: a two-pen log structure on the south side, a twopen timber-framed structure on the north side, and an open, shed-roofed extension to the west
(Figure 33). The barn is roofed with tin sheets, which also cover parts of the walls. The log pens
are 3 m east/west and 4.6 m north/south and are separated by a 2-m-wide breezeway. A doorway
was visible in the south wall of the eastern log pen; presumably, a similar doorway was present in
the western log pen, but is not visible due to the wall collapse (Figure 34).

36

23.

Southerly view of the pump box

Figure 23. Southerly view of the pump box.

The smaller timber-framed structures are attached to the north side of the log pens (Figure 35; see
Figure 33). These structures measure 2.8 m north/south by 3 m east/west. The timber-framing is
exposed on the exterior, but wooden planks cover the interior walls (Figure 36). Small doors on
the interior walls of these structures open into the breezeway. Milled lumber and tin sheets were
used to enclose the northern end of the breezeway (Figure 37).
The shed-roofed extension on the southwest corner of the timber barn is 3-x-3 m in size. It was
built from milled lumber (Figure 38), with the rafters mortised into one of the logs of the adjacent
log pen (Figure 39). An unused mortise on the north side of the log pen suggests that there was a
large structure here at one point, in which case the existing shed-roofed extension is a more recent
replacement.
Two fence lines are associated with the timber barn (see Figure 3). One fence extends from the
southeast corner of the barn toward the log cabin. The second fence line encloses a small area on
the north side of the barn; the north and east sides are of hog wire, and the west side is of barbed

wire. The area enclosed by the fence is slightly elevated from the surrounding landform (Figure
40) and exhibits much loamier topsoil than that found elsewhere onsite. This area is interpreted
as a garden.
Tin Coop
The tin coop is a pole barn in the northwest corner of the property (Figure 41; see Figure 3). The
structure measures 13 m east/west and 4.1 m north/south (Figure 42). The north, east, and west
sides are clad in sheet tin, as is the roof. The south wall is open, but has been partially enclosed
with sheet tin, hog wire, and strands of barbed wire. A small gate allows access to the interior of
the tin coop (Figure 43). The gate is near the open-framed interior divider, which was built from
milled lumber, within the coop (Figure 44). Several pallets rest against this divider. A small, sixlight window is in the north wall. Part of the roof is beginning to collapse.
Much of the material used in the construction appears to have been salvaged. Many of the
supporting poles are round and creosote-impregnated, and are consistent with power and
telephone poles. Other supporting poles are square, milled lumber; drilled holes and cut notches
were noted in these timbers, suggesting that they were salvaged from a demolished structure.
Many regularly placed holes were observed in the tin sheets sheathing the walls (Figure 45),
suggesting that this material was also salvaged. A small pile of milled lumber associated with
two small poles was noted outside the southwest corner of the coop (Figure 46). Given the height
of the poles, the pile of lumber is thought perhaps to represent a possible collapsed shed roof
associated with the coop.

Concrete Foundation
A concrete foundation was discovered in the woods southeast of the log cabin (Figure 47; see
Figure 3). This foundation measures 5.1 m east/west by 3.1 m north/south and has a concrete
floor in the interior. The only two sections of the foundation walls remaining intact are in the
southeast corner (Figure 48). These walls stand 56 cm high above the ground surface and are
15 cm wide. A metal bolt protruding from the wall indicates that some kind of superstructure was
attached to the foundation (Figure 49). The other walls have collapsed outward from the
foundation.
Extensive dumping noted at the feature included materials as diverse at a refrigerator, a hay
mower, concrete pipe sections, and a wooden set of stairs. Most of this material is not obviously
related to the foundation; however, the wooden stairs (Figure 50) might have been associated
with the superstructure supported by the foundation.
Berm
An earthen berm was found in the woods east of the chain link fence (see Figure 3). Based on
historic aerial photographs, the berm was constructed after 1942 and before 1958. The berm
begins a short distance north of the concrete foundation and extends to the northeast (Figure 51).
The top of the berm remains level, but because of decreasing elevation, the berm increases in
height to the north (Figure 52). The function of this feature remains unclear.

Existing Residence
The currently existing residence is still occupied by Mrs. Niblo. The house is to the south of the
older structures and features. It is 22-x-11 m in size, oriented north/south, and sheathed in wide
boards, presumably to give the appearance of a log structure (Figure 53).

SUMMARY

SUMMARY
The main goal of this project was to determine whether any isolable, discrete nineteenth-century
deposits were present at the site. In pursuit of this goal, 20 50-x-50-cm excavation units were
judgmentally placed around the standing structures. Although nineteenth-century materials were
found in some units, they were always in a mixed context with later artifacts. This is thought to
be a result of the thin soils noted onsite, together with the relatively small site area. Although
surface features were common across the site, the only potential subsurface feature encountered is
the anomalous loamy soil found in Unit 9, north of the timber barn.
Niblo Farm is best compared to Penn Farm (41DL192), a nearby antebellum farmstead that has
been subjected to intensive archeological investigations (Jurney et al. 1988). The Penn Farm site
is located about 8.2 kilometers (5 miles) southwest of the Niblo Farm, overlooking the Mountain
Creek valley near the confluence with Walnut Creek. The site was first occupied in 1859 by John
W. Penn, an immigrant from Illinois, and remained in the Penn family until it was purchased by
the U. S. government in the 1970s for the construction of Joe Pool Lake. In all, 14 standing
structures remained to be evaluated at the time of the archeological investigations. The extensive
investigations revealed that most of the units were concentrated near the residences. Large
numbers of historic artifacts were recovered in the units, which contained artifact assemblages
“representative of some of the traditional activities carried out at the farmstead” (Jurney et al.
1988:128).
The Niblo Farm shares many similarities with Penn Farm. Both were first occupied in the
antebellum period, and at both sites, the initial occupants were from the Midwest (Ohio and
Illinois, respectively). Both sites occupy a similar geological context, overlooking the Mountain
Creek drainage, and both sites were farmed throughout most of the history of Dallas County.
However, a significant difference between the two is that at Penn Farm, evidence of activity areas
was observed in the sheet refuse and three subsurface features were identified, but at Niblo Farm
no evidence of subsurface features or activity areas was noted. This may be due to the difference
in the size of the two farms as well as their physical layout, as well as the deeper soils found at
Penn Farm. Conversely, it could be that the Penn family lived and worked the farm continually
from 1859 until its purchase by the federal government in the 1970s, whereas the Niblo Farm
59

appears to have had a more sporadic occupation history. The materials and lack of subsurface
features or activity areas represented in this current investigation of the Niblo Farm indicate that
the use areas and disposal activities changed over time and were no longer easily identified in the
archeological record.
One of the focuses of this investigation was to determine whether isolatable nineteenth-century or
primarily nineteenth-century deposits, features, or material clusters exist within site, particularly
within the fenced area. Interestingly, at the beginning of the investigation, it appeared that the
materials noted on the surface and found in units were too recent—all twentieth century in age.
Once analysis was complete, it was found that of the total 294 artifacts recovered from 20 shovel
tests across the core (fenced) area of the Niblo Farm, 23 artifacts from nine units were identified
as nineteenth century, or primarily nineteenth century, in age, and that there appears to be two
“clusters” of these materials. In other words, just under half of the units did contain some earlier
materials. Unfortunately, none of these artifacts can definitely be associated with the earlier
three-quarters of the nineteenth century, but are more likely remnants of late nineteenth- and turnof-the century occupation of the site. The history of the property indicates that the Sharrock
family owned the property for about 10 years (1845–1853); this would reasonably be enough time
to build a log cabin, a well, and barn, and live and work the land. Unfortunately, the
archeological record from this time period is scarce. The history also indicates that there was
extensive buying and selling of the property between 1867 and 1934 when it was acquired by Mr.
Niblo, but it does not indicate whether a landowner actually lived on the property or whether it
was leased to a neighboring farmer or had a tenant. Nor does the archeological record indicate
that it was occupied during that time, only that there was some type of occupation or use at about
the turn of the century and that site was most active after the 1920s.
CONCLUSIONS
The proposal to construct Joe Pool Lake in the 1970s led to focused examination of the history of
the Mountain Creek area and the results of the development in the area. Based on early settler
accounts, many residents were small landowners who came from the Midwest and Upper South
to settle, work the land, and establish themselves in the new Republic of Texas and future state of
Texas. Families like the Sharrocks and Penns were pioneers in their own right, and the evidence
that they left behind has added to our understanding of the early history of the area. Today, their
properties can still be enjoyed by the public in the form of parks.
Although the investigation conducted at the Niblo Farm failed to yield much of the anticipated
information about the earliest occupations of the property, it still tells an important part of the
story of the site. The Niblo family preserved, maintained, and yet used the early structures after
acquiring the property and continued the farm economy until the property was purchased by the
city in 2005. The overprinting by twentieth-century materials from the Niblo ownership and
occupation did not completely obscure the early component, but did certainly mask it. Twentiethcentury practices of disposal, particularly those from the mid- to latter part of the century, may
have also done away with earlier remains; in other words, the yards around the cabin and current
house, as well as the outbuildings, may have been “cleaned out” over the years and refuse taken
away. The results of other historic-era archeological excavations in the area (e.g., 13 historic
sites at Joe Pool Lake) as well as regional excavations carried out at Ray Roberts, Richland
Creek, and Lake Lewisville diminish the expection of an extensive sheet-refuse pattern or dense
subsurface deposits of materials at early- to midnineteenth-century sites, especially if they were
not continuously occupied, which seems to be the pattern at the Niblo Farm.
60

The inclusion of the extant structures at the Niblo Farm into the park and green space that the city
of Dallas is developing will be an added attraction. Hopefully, the information provided in that
development will inspire respect and preservation for these types of past Texas treasures in all
who live near or visit the park, and enjoy the step back in time.

One sherd has a yellowish
stain

With Owen's ring; faintly
embossed, stylized "H" as
well as "384" are visible; the
"H" symbol appears to be
outer part of a Hazel-Atlas
maker's mark (Toulouse
1971:239) but the inner "A"
symbol is not visible,
probably due to faint marking

Rounded tabular pebble that
is out of geological context
