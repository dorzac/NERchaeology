ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey on 215 hectares (531 acres) of property proposed for development along the left bank
of Clear Creek in Harris County, Texas. Field research activities were conducted between
December 13, 2005 and January 9, 2006, and consisted of walkover, photo-documentation,
and shovel testing within the project area. Subsurface investigation included excavation of
195 shovel tests, and one 50 centimeter by 50 centimeter (19.7 inch by 19.7 inch) test unit in
previously undisturbed areas including portions of previously recorded Sites 41HR189 and
41HR190.
During this investigation, Sites 41HR189 and 41HR190 could not be relocated;
however, cultural materials associated with two previously unrecorded prehistoric
archaeological sites were observed within the project area. Site 41HR1004 is a small Middle
Archaic to Late Prehistoric age subsurface site situated at the crest of a terrace at the
confluence of an unnamed stream and Clear Creek. Shovel tests produced a possible Gary or
Kent projectile point, 5 Goose Creek ware potsherds, and 2 chert flakes at depths of 7 to 25
centimeters (3 to 10 inches) in an Atasco series soil. Due to low artifact density, evidence of
erosion, and modern disturbance to the site, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further
archaeological work be required at 41HR1004.
Site 41HR1005 is a small multicomponent prehistoric and historic subsurface site,
consisting of a thin Rangia midden situated on a flat knob formed by minor drainages
dissecting a terrace along the left bank of Clear Creek. Artifacts recovered from 41HR1005
included 2 late stage chert bifaces, 1 unifacial flake tool, 1 grog tempered potsherd, 4 pieces
of debitage, 4 fragments of burned clay, and 3 burned animal bone fragments recovered at
depths of 15 to 60 centimeters (6 to 24 inches) in an Atasco series soil. The A horizon also
produced a single fragment of a .38 caliber brass rimfire cartridge.
The Rangia midden appears to be approximately 5-centimeters (2-inches) thick and
lies at an average depth of approximately 30 centimeters (12 inches). It is not very dense but
may cover an area as large as 130 square meters (1,399 square feet) within the site boundary.
Though artifact density is low, evidence of possible cooking of bone and shell, heating of
chert, and minimal disturbance to the site, suggest the site does have the potential to yield
information important to an understanding of prehistory in the area; however, current project
plans indicate that Site 41HR1005 will be avoided by construction, and be part of 15 hectares
(37 acres) of Government Land Office (GLO) Open Space. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends that the project be cleared to proceed as long as current construction plans do
not change. Artifacts from both sites will be temporarily stored at the Houston office of
HRA Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is anticipated that all
artifacts will be returned to the landowners.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of
Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on
approximately 215 hectares (531 acres) of property proposed for development along the
north bank of Clear Creek in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1).
The goals of the intensive pedestrian survey were to determine if the project
would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA 1966), as amended (36 CFR 800),
and to establish whether or not previously unidentified archaeological resources were
located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and
federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA]) guidelines.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area consists of approximately 215 hectares (531 acres) of property in
the City of Webster, Harris County, Texas (Figure 2). The parcel is roughly rectangular
in shape, oriented roughly northwest to southeast, and is situated in a partly industrial and
partly rural tract of land in and around the Genco (formerly the Webster) Generating
Station, which is currently undergoing demolition and disassembly.
The northwest boundary of the project area is formed largely by the easement of
East NASA Road 1 along with portions of South Sarah Deel Drive and Knights Bridge
Lane. The northeast boundary is largely formed by Anne Drive, a private driveway and a
powerline/pipeline easement west of these roads, and Pierce Lake. The southwest
boundary is formed largely by the Union Pacific Railroad Easement which runs parallel
and east of State Highway 3, and west of the Old Galveston Highway, which is now an
access road within the Parcel. South of Landolt Street, Old Galveston Road forms the
southwest project boundary, and the southeast project boundary is formed by Clear Creek
(see Figure 2). It should be noted that previously surveyed portions of the right-of-way
of the NASA Road 1 Bypass which cuts diagonally across the northern portion of the
project (see Figure 2), and wetlands associated with the Clear Creek Restoration Project
(see Figure 2) also border but are not included in the project area.
Much of the property is greatly disturbed (see Figure 2). Disturbed areas on the
property include the power plant complex, which is composed of numerous modern
buildings; two associated substations; three railroad sidings; several powerline

easements; several detention basins; artificial drainage ditches and three larger artificial
canals (referred to as Clear Creek and the Hot Water Canal on the Houston Harris County
Atlas [see Key Map 2005:618, 658] but for the purposes of this project referred to as the
South Clear Creek Canal, North Clear Creek Canal and Hot Water Canal; see Figure 2);
artificial ponds; oil storage facilities; numerous oil and gas pipeline easements and
appurtenances; and associated paved and gravel access roads and parking areas. Other
large disturbances include machine-planted pine tree rows and natural and channelized
drainages in the central and northern portions of the parcel.
Disturbances bordering the APE include the storage yard, access roads, and
girders of the partly complete NASA Road 1 Bypass along the northwestern portion of
the property (see Figure 2). In addition, a large 25-acre artificial wetland borders the
southern portion of the project area. Areas of state owned made land (berms) and riprap
along Clear Creek, and smaller wetlands along Clear Creek and the three large canals
leading to it from the power plant, are also visible in aerial imagery of the project area
and its environs (see Figure 2; USGS 1995; 2002).
The parcel is being considered for use as a residential condominium complex;
however, detailed plans for the proposed undertaking are not currently available. Due to
the lack of specific plans, the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this project will be
defined as all privately owned terrestrial property within the parcel. APE depth will be
considered to extend to culturally sterile strata. It should be noted that this depth is not
anticipated to exceed more than 1.5 meters (5 feet) because a preliminary review of the
literature for the parcel indicates that the soils in the vicinity of the parcel have a lowmoderate potential to contain deeply buried intact cultural resources (Abbott 2001;
Wheeler 1976).

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE PROJECT AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological
characteristics found along the Clear Creek drainage in southeastern Harris County and
northeastern Galveston County, north of League City, Galveston County, Texas. This is
followed by discussions of soil morphology, climate, and floral and faunal species typical
of the area.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain
is characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The
Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far
west as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological
characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Galveston
County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea
level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and
subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s
rivers. Galveston and Harris Counties are underlain by relatively recent sedimentary
rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Pleistocene to the Holocene
(Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992; Crenwelge et al. 1988:101; Van Siclen 1991; Wheeler 1976).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott
2001; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human
occupation in the region surrounding the project area include the Beaumont Formation,
generally believed to predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called
“Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent
deposits. These terraces date to between one hundred thousand to four thousand years
ago, and are characterized as consisting “of up to three inset fluvial
terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative
of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater than that seen
today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or thin
Holocene deposits, laid down in the areas by alluvial or eolian factors, or potentially,
marshy environments (Aronow 2005).
Along smaller rivers, such as the San Jacinto and Trinity, valley infilling has not
advanced to the point where these “Deweyville” formations are completely buried by
Holocene sediments. Consequently, remnants of these deposits are preserved as terraces
that are situated between modern floodplain and upland areas. These terraces would have
been relatively elevated and dry surfaces within the valleys until they were covered by

6

aggrading overbank deposits (Abbot 2001: 16). Given their physical characteristics, the
“Deweyville” terraces may have been attractive loci for human occupation during the
Holocene. While primary “Deweyville” deposits have a low potential for archaeological
remains, the age of these formations are not clearly established. Therefore, the possibility
for buried archaeological remains exists within portions of the “Deweyville” formation
(Abbot 2001: 106).

SOILS
The proposed project area contains soils mapped as consisting of the following
soil types: Atasco fine sandy loam, 1-4% slopes (AtB); Beaumont clay (Ba), BeaumontUrban land complex (Bc); Lake Charles clay, 0-1% slopes (LcA); Verland silty clay loam
(Md); and Verland-Urban land complex (Mu). Ijam series (Is) and Harris series (Ha)
soils also occur in and near the project area, namely along the marshland border of the
APE with the main channel of Clear Creek, and along the two large artificial canals
draining southward from the Genco Generating Station (see Figure 2). These Harris
County soils have been described by Wheeler (1976); however, more recent descriptions
taken from neighboring Galveston County (Crenwelge et al. 1988), and national soil
databases (NCSS Web Soil Survey [NCSS] 2006; SSS NRCS USDA 2006) offer more
recent and accurate descriptions and maps of these soils. The distribution of the soils
across the project area was shown in Figure 2 in relation to project plans.
The Beaumont and Verland (formerly Midland) series soils in the project area are
grouped as part of the Midland-Beaumont association, while the Lake Charles series soils
are components of the Lake Charles-Bernard association (Wheeler 1976:4; NCSS 2006).
Both of these soil associations are typically characterized by soils that are somewhat
poorly drained to poorly drained, very slowly permeable and may be clayey or loamy in
character (Wheeler 1976). All of the soil associations mapped in the project area are
found on low uplands in the Coastal Prairie region, where they developed on Pleistocene
age sediments of the Beaumont formation (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992; Crenwelge et al.
1988; NCSS 2006; Van Siclen 1991; Wheeler 1976). Atasco soils are a minor
component of the Aldine-Ozan soil association, which is so minor in the area that is it not
shown in the generalized county soil map (Wheeler 1976). The soils of the Aldine-Ozan
association are also somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained, very slowly permeable
soils; however, they are typically associated with gently sloping forested areas bordering
natural drainages such as Clear Creek (Wheeler 1976:6-7).
According to SSS NRCS USDA (2006), the typical Beaumont clay pedon exhibits
Ap/A-Bg-Bssg horizonation. The Ap horizon in the type section is 0 to13-centimeters (0
to 5-inches) thick, and underlain by an A-horizon to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches).
The A horizons are typically clays of grayish color with Munsell (1993) hues of 10YR or
2.5Y, values of 4 to 5, and chromas of 1 or 2; exhibiting moderate fine angular blocky
structure (weak where plowed); and being extremely hard and extremely firm. Fine and
medium roots are common, while pores are generally few and tend to be fine in size.
Coarse iron accumulations in shades or red, yellow or brown are rare to common

7

particularly in pores and along root channels, and a few fine iron-manganese concretions
are also reported.
The underlying Bg horizon is approximately 25-centimeters (10-inches) thick clay
similar in structure, consistence, and composition to the overlying A-horizon. It is
distinguished from the A-horizon by yellowish brown colors (Munsell [1993] hues of
10YR to 5Y, and N; values of 5 to 7; and chromas of 0 to 2), and a generally higher
incidence of iron-manganese concretions.
The Bssg horizon underlies the Bg horizon and is subdivided into as many as
three Bssg subhorizons (Bssg1, Bssg2, and Bssg3) all of which are separated by a gradual
wavy boundary. All three of the Bssg horizons are very similar and difficult to
distinguish in the field. Textures are typically clay, that is extremely hard and extremely
firm and exhibits fine angular blocky structure. Few fine and medium roots and few fine
pores occur throughout the Bssg horizon, and “many prominent slickensides tilted 65 to
75 degrees from horizontal that are 4 to 6 inches apart (SSS NRCS USDA 2006)” also
characterize the horizon. Color is similar to that of the Bg horizon (Munsell [1993] hues
of 10YR to 5Y, and N, values of 5 to 7, and chromas of 0 to 2). The combined Bssg
horizon can extend to depths greater than 203 centimeters (80 inches), with subhorizons
ranging in thickness between 25 and 76 centimeters (10 and 30 inches) (SSS NRCS
USDA 2006).
According to SSS NRCS USDA (2006), typical Verland series soils occur on
“low concave terraces above stream channels on uplands” and are characterized by Ap/ABtg(1-3) horizonation. The Ap/A horizon extends to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches)
and is typically a silty clay loam with Munsell (1993) hue of 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and
chromas of 1 or 2. The underlying Btg1 horizon is approximately 15 to 75 centimeters (6
to 30 inches) thick, and can be clayey or loamy in character with Munsell (1993) hues of
10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 1 or 2. Few to many FeMn redox
concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, or gray occur in the Btg1 horizon, and
calcium carbonate concretions are also present, generally in a thin layer. The Btg1
horizon is also characterized by slickensides (SSS NRCS USDA 2006).
The Btg horizon is generally underlain by two Btg horizons that range in
thickness from 20 to 89 centimeters (8 to 35 inches). Both lower Btg horizons resemble
the overlying Btg horizon; calcium carbonate concretions are larger in Btg2 and absent
from Btg3, and iron-manganese concretions are present only in the lower Btg horizons.
BA horizons are sometimes associated with this series and calcareous C-horizons can
also be present below the Btg horizons in some areas. Verland soils in the project area
were formerly mapped as Midland soils (see NCSS 2006) to which they are closely
related (SSS NRCS USDA 2006).
Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (abbreviated “LaA” in Crenwelge et al.
1988:sheet 7 and in Wheeler 1976) is a nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soil found
on broad uplands. In neighboring Galveston County, it is described as having Ap/Ahorizons composed of very dark gray clay from 0 to 62 centimeters (0 to 24 inches). The

8

lowest A-horizon is underlain by a dark gray clay Bg1-horizon from 62 to 129
centimeters (24 to 51 inches) and a gray clay Bg2-horizon below this, to a depth of
approximately 157 centimeters (62 inches). This soil is typically moderately acid in its
upper part becoming moderately alkaline with depth.
When dry, the Ap/A-horizons in Lake Charles clay can be very hard. When
moist, they are generally very firm but crumbly and when wet, extremely plastic and
sticky, and slowly permeable. The Bg1 is often mottled with light yellowish brown and
reddish yellow. The Bg2 is lighter in color, alkaline, and contains occasional concretions
of calcium carbonate. As with overlying clayey layers, when moist, the Bg2 is very firm.
When wet, it is extremely sticky and plastic, slowly permeable, and grades into the parent
material of yellowish-red calcareous clays at depths of 1.5 to 2.4 meters (5 to 8 feet).
The surface of Beaumont and Lake Charles series soils in the greater Houston
area often exhibits gilgai microrelief (also called “hog wallow” microrelief). This is
described by Mowery et. al. (1960:11, figure 4) in his soil guide to neighboring Fort Bend
County. Typically, layers in areas between the hog wallows are 13 to 25 centimeters (5
to 10 inches) thick, while the surface layer in hog wallows can be up to 152 centimeters
(60 inches) thick. The surface layers also range in color from gray to black in areas of
gilgai microrelief (Mowery et. al. 1960:11). The gilgai are attributed to shrink-swell
processes in clays. Shrinkage of clay caused by water loss during the dry season results
in the formation of large cracks that are open to the surface. The cracks are subsequently
filled by granular Ap/A-horizon materials, and during the wet season the water saturated
clay soil expands sealing the cracks and pushing soil on either side of the crack upwards.
The net result is gligai microrelief: low depressed areas (gilgai) where cracks used to be
and slightly higher areas away between cracks (see Foth 1978:figure 11-24; Mowery et
al. 1960:11).
Atasco soils “occupy nearly level to gently sloping [forested] convex ridges.
Slope gradients are typically 1 through 5 percent, but range to 8 percent. The soil formed
in thick beds of unconsolidated sediments of sandy clay loam and sandy clay of
Pleistocene age (SSS NRCS USDA 2006).” The soils exhibit A-E/B-B/E-Bt-Btg
horizonation and can be over 152-centimeters (60-inches) thick.
A typical Atasco series A/Ap horizon has a thickness of 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to
5 inches) and is composed of fine sandy loam with Munsell hue 10YR, values of 3 to 5,
and chroma of 2 or 3. It exhibits weak fine granular structure; is slightly hard, friable,
contains common fine roots and a few worm casts and has a clear smooth boundary.
Organic litter is often present on the surface forming a thin AO horizon up to 1
centimeter (0.4-inch) thick. The underlying E horizon is 16 to 36-centimeters (6 to 14
inches) thick composed of fine sandy loam with Munsell hue 10YR, values of 5 to 7, and
chroma of 3 or 4. It is similar in most respects to the overlying A/Ap-horizon but
exhibits common fine distinct strong brown mottles and is separated from an underlying
An 8 to 18-centimeter (3 to 7 inches) thick Bt/E horizon by a clear wavy boundary.

9

The Atasco Bt/E horizon is composed of common pockets of light grayish brown
(10YR 6/2) uncoated fine sand 5 to 10 millimeters (0.2 to 0.4 inches) in size, and roughly
30 percent E-horizon material surrounding bodies of hard, friable sandy clay loam (Bt
horizon materials).
The Bt component of the Atasco Bt/E horizon, and the underlying 25 to 46centimeter (10 to 18-inch) thick Bt-horizon are very similar. Textures may be clay, silty
clay loam, or clay loam and colors vary in the Munsell (1994) range of hue 7.5YR or
10YR, value 5 or 6, and chroma 6 to 8. Mottles of red and less commonly shades of gray
occur, and the soil exhibits moderate coarse prismatic parting to moderate fine angular
blocky structure. It is extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic. Continuous clay films are
common on the surfaces of peds and thin vertical streaks of uncoated fine sand occur
between prism faces.
Two Btg horizons underlie the Atasco Bt-horizon. Both of these are similar in
many respects being composed of gray (10YR 6/1) clay that is extremely hard, firm,
sticky and plastic and contains common fine prominent red mottles and patchy clay films.
They are also similar in thickness being approximately 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14inches) thick. The Btg1 can be distinguished from the Btg2 by the less common
occurrence of fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles, structure
and parting. Btg1 exhibits weak coarse prismatic parting to moderate fine angular blocky
structure and has uncoated fine sand and silt coatings on faces of prisms similar to the
overlying Bt-horizon. Btg2 is characterized by weak fine angular blocky structure.
Harris series soils occur in some wetland areas bordering the project area along
Clear Creek, and in the extreme southern portion of the project. The soils of the Harris
series are described as: “very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that
formed in saline clayey coastal sediments [that typically occur] on broad [flat] tidal areas
in coastal marshes that are saturated for long periods (SSS NRCS USDA 2006).” In
addition, the Harris soils are typically “saturated to the surface for periods of 4 to 8
months and seldom [dry] to below field capacity” (SSS NRCS USDA 2005).
These soils typically exhibit Ag-Bg-Cg zonation. According to the SSS NRCS
USDS, the total thickness of the Harris Ag-horizon ranges from 25 to 61 centimeters (10
to 24 inches) and generally exhibits hues in the range of 10YR, 5Y, or N; values between
2 and 3; and a chroma of 1 or less. Brown or yellow masses of iron accumulation can be
common across the series (SSS NRCS USDA 2005). The Bg1 horizon is 25 to 46
centimeters (10 to 18 inches) thick while the Bg2 horizon is 30 to 51 centimeters (12 to
20 inches) thick. Typically the Bg and C-horizons have a hue of 10YR, 5Y, or N, values
of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less. Yellow and brown redoximorphic features consisting
mostly of iron-manganese and iron accumulations and gray iron depletions range from
few to common. Texture is clay or silty clay. The remainder of the Harris pedon is
typically a Cg horizon, but a 2C horizon may also be present below a depth of 1.5 meters
(5 feet). The 2C horizon is similar in color to the overlying Bg and Cg horizons but can
be loamier and stratified with sandy materials (SSS NRCS USDA 2005).

10

In the greater Houston area, processes of urbanization have resulted in native soils
being mixed with construction fill, debris and other materials. In such areas, soils are
mapped as part of Urban complexes. For example, in the project area, Beaumont-Urban
complex soils are mapped near the Genco Generating Station, while Verland-Urban soils
are mapped southwest of the southernmost canal along Old Galveston Road (NCSS
2006). These soil map units contain both areas of disturbance, and areas of native
Beaumont and Verland series soils that are too small to map separately. In contrast, areas
known to consist entirely of dredge tailings or other fill material are mapped as Ijam soils
(NCSS 2006; SSS NRCS USDA 2006; Wheeler 1976).
According to SSS NRCS USDA (2006), Ijam series are situated “on nearly level
concave coastal areas bordering waterways, ditches, and canals. The soils developed in
alkaline, saline, clayey sediments dredged or pumped from the floor of rivers, bays, and
canals or from marshes in construction of canals or waterways.” A typical Ijam pedon
exhibits A-Cg zonation and can be 200 centimeters (80 inches) thick. The A horizon has
color hues of 10YR to 5Y; values of 4 to 7, and chromas of 0 to 2 are normal for the A
horizon which is typically a clay, clay loam, or loam. The colors and textures of the Cg
horizon are also in this range, though sandy or loamy sediments can occur throughout the
pedon as lenses, pockets or other stratified and unstratified deposits reflecting the manner
in which the dredged materials were deposited.
In this pedogenic context, the probability of detecting deep subsurface cultural
materials in the lower B-horizons of the Atasco, Beaumont, and Lake Charles series soils
is extremely low. This is because the dense clayey subsoil horizons of these soil series
apparently formed by weathering of Beaumont formation sediments of Pleistocene age.
It is also highly likely that near-surface soil horizons developed on sloping riverbanks
such as those of Clear and Chigger Creeks may contain cultural materials, but that such
materials are likely to be in secondary context, derived from local weathering of higher
landscape surfaces and redeposited by wind, colluvial, and fluvial processes.
It should also be noted that the Atasco, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Verland and
Ijam series soils in the project area are mapped in Potential Archaeological Liability Map
(PALM) Unit 4, while Harris series soils are mapped in PALM Unit 3 (Abbott
2001:figure 66, table 3). The PALM system is a model developed by the Texas
Department of Transportation to help assess the geoarchaeological likelihood of detecting
significant prehistoric cultural resources in various geomorphological settings in the
greater Houston area (Abbott 2001:151-168). For PALM Unit 4 the probability of
detecting significant resources is very low due largely to processes of urbanization
associated with the growth and expansion of the Houston area in the twentieth century
(Abbott 2001).
In contrast, Harris series soils have a slightly higher potential to contain buried
prehistoric materials, but these soils are largely associated with wetlands in the project
area that lie outside the APE and will not be disturbed by construction.

CLIMATE
The close proximity to Galveston and Harris Counties to the Gulf of Mexico tends
to influence the temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Summers are
hot and humid; winters are warm and only occasionally experience incursions of polar air
from the north. In Galveston County the average daily temperature in the summer is 83
degrees (Fahrenheit) with an average winter temperature of 47 degrees (Fahrenheit).
Rainfall is highest in the summer and early fall with an average yearly total of 100.9
centimeters (39.73 inches) (Crenwelge et al. 1988).

FLORA AND FAUNA
The project area is located near the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic
province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central
Texas suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been
populated by vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment.
Climactic fluxuation during the Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend
towards warmer weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple,
and pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually
transition to an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time
would include currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller
game, as well as bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American
alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a
diverse collection of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern
land alteration activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the
removal of native plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak,
pecan, various elms, cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle,
dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses
(Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel,
opossum, raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles
including the Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species.
Black bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The upper Texas coast is viewed by many researchers as a buffer zone between
cultural regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as
being an interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along
similar lines, both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic
archaeological record of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to
literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture
found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74) states, “it loosely connotes activities by
populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the southeastern
Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric archaeology of Southeast Texas
represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Researchers have identified six archaeological time periods associated with
Native Americans in what Perttula (2004:figure 1.1) calls the southeast Texas
archeological region, which includes Galveston County (Hall 1981; Patterson 1995;
Perttula, ed. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). In general, these include the Paleoindian,
Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1995) chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,0008000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle
Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and
the Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a
Southeast Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D.
400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750).
Perttula (2004:table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004:figure 6.1.1) provide a recent chronology for
the Upper Texas Coast that is also applicable to the Project area and includes Early
Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-6000 B.C.), Early Archaic
(6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500-200 B.C.);
Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 7001250), Final Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Early Historic (A.D. 1700-1800) periods.

13

All of the chronologies developed by these researchers are based primarily on
changes in projectile point technologies, and the introduction of pottery to the region.
Despite their differences, it is also generally recognized by all these researchers that a
broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods up to
and during early European contact in southeast Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
The Island of Galveston, for which the county is named, was first encountered by
Europeans when Juan de Grijavla made landfall on the island in 1519. Various early
explorers knew the island as Isla de Malado, the “Isle of Misfortune” or the Isla de
Culebras, the “Isle of Snakes.” It is thought that the Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca, as a member of the Narvárez expedition in 1528, was shipwrecked on
the island. In 1685, the French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, sought
to challenge the Spanish for control of the area. He is credited with naming the island
“San Louis” in honor of Louis XIV of France. In 1783, José Antonio de Evia, a Spanish
navigator, surveyed the waters near the island and named the bay Galvezton after Viceroy
Bernardo de Gálvez. The island was known as San Luis for a time, but by 1820 had
become known as Galveston Island (Daniels 2005; McComb 1986).
The year 1815 marked the beginning of the Anglo-American presence in the area.
Henry Perry and Warren D. C. Hall, former members of the Gutiérrez-Magee expedition,
made landfall on the peninsula north of the island with three ships and 200 men. Perry
named the point for Simón Bolívar, who had commissioned him to disrupt Spanish
commerce in the Gulf. In 1817, Laffite established a fort on the island he named
Campeche, after a town on the Yucatan peninsula. The fort was destroyed by a storm a
year later, but by 1819 the settlement had a population between 1,000 to 2,000 people
(Daniels 2005).
Under Spanish rule population growth continued at a slow pace. After the Texas
revolution, an increase in the flow of commerce through the port consolidated the island’s
importance as a finance and trade hub. The port shipped cotton and cottonseed oil, as
well as cattle, sugar, and other locally produced commodities (McComb 1986).
Galveston County was founded in 1838 from portions of Harrisburg, Liberty, and
Brazoria counties. When Texas joined the union Galveston was the largest city in the
state. By the Civil War, however, the city of Houston had begun to overshadow
Galveston as a port of entry for shipping and as a manufacturing center. By 1880, the
county of Galveston had population of approximately 24,100 and the city was still the
largest in the state (Kleiner 2005).
The hurricane of 1900 dramatically altered the course of development in the
county. It was the most costly natural disaster in terms of lives lost in U.S. history and
resulted in the deaths of between 10,000 and 12,000 people on the island. In spite of this,
the county continued to flourish until the Great Depression. This decline lasted until the

14

1970’s when preservation efforts were undertaken to revitalize historic portions of the
island (McComb 1986).
Much of the current commercial activity in the county is associated with the
petrochemical industry, although tourism, medical services, and waterborne commerce
are also important to the area (Kleiner 2005).

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A number of research projects have been conducted in and along Clear Creek in
close proximity to the study area. Many of these investigations were conducted inside
the 1.6-kilometer study radius of the project and are discussed in more detail in the
Previously Recorded Resources section of Chapter VI. What follows is a chronological
summary of investigations conducted in the vicinity of the project.
Investigations in the area date to the late 1960s when Hester and Corbin (1968)
recorded several sites, including 41GV10 and 141GV17, which are Rangia midden sites
that lie inside the current study radius. Site 41GV10 returned two radiocarbon dates, one
of which was associated with the Late Archaic period (circa 500 BC +/- 70), and the
other to the Late Ceramic period (circa AD 1210 +/- 70).
The most extensive investigations along Clear Creek were conducted by the
University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
The USACE survey (McGuff and Cox 1973), assessed potential flood control impacts to
cultural resources located along Clear Creek, and identified 76 prehistoric and two
historic sites. It was determined that 51 of the prehistoric sites and one of the historic
sites could be adversely affected by proposed flood control modifications. The
prehistoric sites were situated within two specific loci and as such were deemed to
represent a type of site density not previously observed in the area. Recommendations
were made for the avoidance of these resources and plans for the mitigation of these sites
were proposed in the event avoidance was not possible. Sites recorded by the
USACE/University of Texas at Austin are described in Chapter VI.
Following the USACE study (McGuff and Cox 1973) most research in the area
consisted of revisitation of sites identified during that project (Bailey 1987a-b; Hines
1993; Howard et al. 1983; Howard and Mercado-Allinger 1983; Hudson 1979; MercadoAllinger et al. 1984; Mercado-Allinger and Howard 1983; Mercado-Allinger et al. 1983),
or smaller surveys associated with localized construction projects (see Denton 1984;
Mercado-Allinger and Howard 1984; Pickering 2005).
The Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas On-line also lists a number of other types of
cultural resources surveys in and near the study region. These include several
architectural studies of historic structures associated with the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson
Space Flight Center in the City of Webster; the recent League City Park Survey
conducted by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. on the grounds of the Walter G. and Helen Hall
House (41GV149) (see McWilliams and Dase 2004); over 20 neighborhood surveys
conducted in the City of League City in Galveston County across Clear Creek from the
project, and shipwreck recordation in the channel of Clear Creek.

16

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH
It should be noted that most of the prehistoric sites recorded near the project area
(see Figure 1) were detected in surface or near-surface contexts along Clear Creek.
Depths of cultural materials at prehistoric sites within a mile of the project (see Chapter
VI) varied between 0 and 0.46 meters (0 and 18.11 inches). Several other sites including
41GV53 and 41GV78 were detected in and near marshes associated with the Clear Creek
drainage system (see Figure 1). These sites were also shallow with depths of cultural
materials ranging between 10 and 90 centimeters (4 and 36 inches). Site 41GV53 had the
deepest cultural resources of all of the sites within the study radius, at depths up to 90
centimeters (36 inches) depth.
No sites previously detected in soil associations known to be mapped in the
current project area were deeper than half a meter, (19 inches) which is to be expected
given the dense nature and Pleistocene age of the clayey substrates of such soils in
Galveston and Harris Counties (see Abbott 2001; Crenwelge et al. 1988; Wheeler 1976)

17

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess effects
to cultural resources impacted by construction activities initiated by this project.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The project area is situated on 215 hectares (531 acres) of land proposed for
development along Clear Creek. Activities associated with this undertaking will most likely
consist of the construction of residential and commercial properties and associated road and
utility easements. The archaeological survey project area is defined as all property within
the proposed project boundaries.
A key factor in creating a strategy for sampling a project area is in developing a
predictive model whereby testing can be concentrated most efficiently in areas with the
greatest potential for containing intact cultural resources. These models are based on soil
and topographic characteristics, including variations in elevation, distance to existing or
remnant water sources, and plant communities. Generally, these include areas located near
existing watercourses on higher topographic landforms containing well drained, sandy soils.
These models serve as heuristic devices that assists researchers in devising sampling
strategies best suited for collecting data in given environmental settings. Based on the
results of previous studies, the predictive model developed for this project area, indicated
that undisturbed areas on higher topographic landforms near Clear Creek held the highest
potential for containing intact cultural resources.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site file
research was performed in order to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites
within 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) of the project areas, and all recorded historic structures
eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent to the project APE. Site file research was used
to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey, and additional documentary
research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development and
history of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research
then was used to prepare an overview history of the area, and provided an understanding
of the contextual framework of Galveston County’s prehistory and history.

18

METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of prehistoric and historic archaeological
resources, within the defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the
collection of data needed in order to determine whether additional investigations would
be required to evaluate the potential eligibility of any newly defined archaeological
resources for inclusion on the NRHP or as a state designated landmark.
Archaeological methods employed during this survey consisted of pedestrian
survey augmented by systematic shovel testing. In areas where surface visibility allowed
for an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a
surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at the location
of each planned shovel test.
Shovel tests were placed at intervals that ranged between 30 to 200 meters (98.43
to 656.2 feet). Shovel testing intervals were decreased in areas deemed to possess a high
probability for archaeological resources. Areas of moderate to low probability were
sampled at a lower frequency. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing
standing water.
Linear transects were utilized to facilitate survey activities within the limits of the
entire project area. These transects were spaced at 30 meter (98.43 foot) intervals. Shovel
testing was performed on all transects situated within high and moderate probability
areas. In low probability areas, shovel testing was performed on alternating transects
only; pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted on those transects not sampled by shovel
testing.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) into the underlying substratum
or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through
1
/4-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (1994) soil color charts. Additional information concerning
soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each excavation.

CURATION
Artifacts recovered during field investigation are temporarily stored at the
Houston office of HRA Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is
anticipated that all artifacts will be provided to the landowners. If curation in a state
repository is required, artifacts will be prepared for curation according to guidelines
specified by the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology
and Historic Preservation (1983).

19

At the completion of fieldwork, the artifacts were appropriately cleaned and
allowed to dry. After identification, each unique artifact or group were placed in 4 mil
plastic resealable bags. Identification tags made from acid-free paper were placed with
the artifacts for future identification. Each tag contains the title of the final report, the
HRA Gray & Pape project number, an individual artifact number, full provenience
information, entire artifact description, processing date, and count.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

There are no National Register listed properties located within the project APE.
Two previously identified sites, Site 41HR189 and 41HR190, are recorded within the
APE, but could not be re-located during the current survey. In addition, a modern
shipwreck is recorded just outside the APE. Two newly identified archaeological sites,
Sites 41HR1004 and 41HR1005 were encountered during survey. The results of the site
file research are discussed in the following section, followed by a discussion of the
results of the field investigation.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all
recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area and all
recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the
project’s APE.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

SITES WITHIN THE STUDY RADIUS
Site file research indicated that 14 previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area (Table 1). Of these, two
are prehistoric open terrace sites; one is a campsite; one is an open prehistoric scatter;
three are prehistoric shell middens one of which is associated with burials; three are
prehistoric Rangia shell middens; one is a defunct historic power plant, one is a historic
commercial building (the Butler Building); one is an historic home site (The W.G. &
Helen Hall Home); and one is unknown.
Site 41GV10, also known as Spanish Moss Site, is a large Rangia shell
midden and campsite. The presence of two pimple mounds and a stratified shell midden
make this a site of particular interest. The site “appears to contain a high potential for
establishing a close relationship through chronological controls of (humate dates, shell
dating, diagnostics) the deposits in the shell midden and pimple mounds” (Bailey 1987a;
page #). A total of three previous investigations have been conducted at 41GV10, using
shovel tests, profile excavations, backhoe tests, auger tests, and test pits. A variety of
ceramic sherds and faunal remains were found, most at depths of less than 20 centimeters
(8 inches). The Rangia shell midden can be found at a depth of 30 to 92 centimeters (1 to
3 feet), beginning 8 to 13 centimeters (3 to 5 inches) below the surface.

Radiocarbon dating conducted by Hester and Corbin (1968) dates Site 41GV10 to
roughly 500 BC (+/- 70) and AD 1210 (+/- 70), dating its occupation to the Late Archaic
and Late Ceramic time periods. The site is severely threatened by erosion, and previous
investigators have suggested mitigation and further testing (Bailey 1987a; Hester and
Corbin 1968; Howard et al. 1983).
Site 41GV17 is composed of two prehistoric Rangia middens each of which
contains a shell lens at depths of 1 to 5 centimeters (0.4 to 5 inches) and 10 to 15
centimeters (4 to 6 inches), respectively (Hester and Corbin 1968; Mercado-Allinger et
al. 1984). The middens have not been excavated and the cultural affiliation of the
deposits is unknown (Hester and Corbin 1968). No prehistoric artifacts were found at the
site; however, a variety of ceramic sherds and faunal remains were noted at unspecified
depths in the 1980s (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1984).
Site 41GV53 is a stratified shell midden similar to Site 41GV10. Based on C-14
dating, the site’s occupation has been dated to the pre-ceramic and late prehistoric time

22

periods (Bailey 1987b). Though the site has been greatly disturbed by the construction of
FM 270, it still yielded an impressive amount of artifacts (approximately 2424), including
both lithics and ceramics. Test pits and backhoe trench excavations also recovered
preserved bone, burned shell, clay, and concretions at depths ranging from 10 to 90
centimeters (4 to 35 inches). Mitigation and protection were recommended by previous
investigators (Bailey 1987b; Mercado-Allinger and Howard 1983; Hudson and McGuff
1973).
Prewitt and Associates (Hines 1993) excavated a portion of site 41GV53,
situated on a knoll along a meander bend in Clear Creek, in Galveston County, Texas.
Field efforts concentrated on the documentation of the profiles of six backhoe trenches
and the recovery of human remains from four burial features located in the uppermost
Ceramic-period components of the shell midden.
Site 41GV55 is a Rangia midden situated approximately 10-15 feet above the
waterline of Clear Creek along its south bank. The site is a surface site characterized by
small Rangia shells. McGuff (1973) recorded the site as being 5 to 7.6-centimeters (1.8
to 2.7-inches) thick and approximately 9 square meters (97 square feet) in area . At the
time it was last studied in the early 1980s, less than half of the site was preserved. It
measured in area 2.7 square meters (29 square feet) in area, with the remainder impacted
by erosion, trash disposal, and construction of a picnic area (Howard and MercadoAllinger 1983). Testing of the site at that time was limited to two shovel tests placed near
its edge. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site include several sherds of sandy
paste pottery. A small quantity of chert debitage and two stone tools, namely a biface
and a scraper, have been recovered from the site (Howard and Mercado-Allinger 1983;
Hudson 1979; McGuff 1973).
Site 41GV56 is a prehistoric scatter recorded by McGuff (1973) near an earthen
boat ramp along the right bank of Clear Creek. The entire assemblage from the site
consisted of two chert flakes detected on the surface. Howard and Mercado-Allinger
(1983) revisited the site a decade later and reported the boat ramp had been covered in
asphalt. The site is likely to have been destroyed by erosion associated with the
improvement of the boat ramp. Its cultural affiliation is unknown (Howard and MercadoAllinger 1983).
Site 41GV76 is an undisturbed Ceramic site of great significance. In a previous
investigation of this pimple mound, a single shovel test yielded sherds, bone, and Rangia
shell 30 to 45 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) below the surface. “Avoidance is highly
recommended for this site because of its high information yield potential, seemingly from
its apparent intactness, and the uncommon composition (Rangia shell layer)” (MercadoAllinger et al. 1983:1).
Site 41GV78 is a shell midden of unknown temporal affiliation. A pedestrian
survey in 1984 by Joe Denton yielded no cultural materials. The midden itself was
observed in a road cut and is roughly 30 centimeters (12 inches) below the surface.
Denton notes the possibility that this could be residual from the construction of FM 270
and has only tentatively classified it as a shell midden (Denton 1984).

Site 41GV79 is the Butler Building which was constructed in 1906. It was the
first brick building in League City. In the early 1900s the building contained a bank, a
grocery store, and a drug store on its first floor, while the second floor contained medical
and real estate offices. It is now apparently in poor condition due to neglect and the state
of modification of its interior is unknown. Reese and Gilmne (1984:1) note:
“The Butler Building may have a high research potential because it is the earliest
brick structure in League City, it played an integral role in the early 20th century
commercial history of the community, and it was associated with a prominent
local figure [George W. Butler].”
The structure is well outside the APE of this project and will not be assessed as part of
this study.
Site 41GV100 is an open campsite of unspecified temporal affiliation. No additional
information is available for this site. Site 41GV142 is located in League City. Only the
UTM coordinates of this site are available in the Texas Archaeological Atlas Online. No
additional information is available for this site. Site 41GV149 is a Historic home built in
1913. The W.G. and Helen Hall Home occupies ten acres of land and is owned by the
City of League City. Walter and Helen Hall were significant figures in League City’s
history. They were prominent bank owners who greatly influenced public policy during
the New Deal era and the Civil Rights movement. Because this home has been altered
significantly as recently as the 1980s, it is likely that this site is ineligible for NRHP.
None of these sites are within the proposed project area (McWilliams 2004).
Site 41HR529 is a historic site located northeast of the project area near Clear
Creek and was recorded by Fields, Mercado-Allinger and Howard (1984). The site
consists of the poorly preserved remains of a power plant that provided power for the
Houston-Galveston electric Railroad in the early 20th Century. They recommended no
further work at the site because much of it had been demolished, and because it is likely
to be documented in historic records.

SITES IN AND NEAR THE APE
Portions of Site 41HR189 lie within the APE for this project (see Figure 1). The
site was initially recorded by McGuff (1973). Mercado-Allinger and Howard (1983)
indicate that: “McGuff collected pottery, five dart points, scrappers, and a number of
lithic flakes and chips” from the site. McGuff (1973) also reported disturbances to depths
of 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) by bulldozing and associated sheet erosion. Based
on diagnostic materials in this assemblage (McGuff 1973) classified the site as a
multicomponent Archaic & Late Prehistoric open terrace site. Subsequent surveys by
Hudson (1979) and Mercado-Allinger (1983) were unable to relocate the site, and based
on its platted location close to a canal and the artificial wetland and reports of erosion by
McGuff (1973) they site may to have been destroyed by construction activities.

24

Site 41HR190 lies within the APE for this project (see Figure 1). The site was
initially recorded by McGuff & Cox (1973) who detected 2 lithic flakes associated with
road gravels. Mercado-Allinger and Howard (1983) revisited the site and noted that “A
few lithic chips and flakes (chert) were observed in dirt roadbed. This suggests nonlocal
and recent road materials have been introduced and there is no prehistoric site here and it
should be declassified” Mercado-Allinger and Howard (1983:1).

OTHER SURVEYS IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROJECT
The evaluation of architectural and other non-archaeological resources was outside
the scope of this project. However, a search of the THC Texas Archaeological Atlas Online also revealed that a variety of other cultural resources are situated within the vicinity of
the project. These include a total of one shipwreck and 18 neighborhood surveys recorded
within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project; and several historic structures
associated with the Johnson Space Center approximately 2 to 4 kilometers (1.2 to 2.4 miles)
northeast of the project.
The shipwreck (THC Shipwreck Number 1131) is located at the mouth of the South
Clear Creek Canal just offshore from the southeast boundary of the project (see Figure 1).
The ship was lost in 1976, and is outside the APE for this project.
All 18 neighborhood surveys (Geocoded Texas Atlas Numbers: 3003001295;
3003001289; 3003001280; 3003001281; 3003001282; 3003001276; 3003001277;
3003001278; 3003001279; 3003001285; 3003001274; 3003001275; 3003001288;
3003001291; 3003001292; 3003001273; 3003001271; and 3003001272) involve structures
in the city of League City, Texas (See Figure 1), on the opposite side of Clear Creek,
southeast of the project area. All of these structures lie well outside the APE for this project.
They will not be discussed further in this report, which focuses on the results of intensive
pedestrian survey of the project area.
Four structures associated with the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (see Figure 1)
are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Al four lie well outside the 1.6
kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project, but within a 3.2 kilometer (2 mile) radius of
the project. They include: the West, James and Jessie, Mansion (THC Atlas Reference
Number: 94001015), which is also known as the Lunar Science Institute and the Lunar
and Planetary Institute; the Saturn V Launch Vehicle (THC Atlas Reference Number:
2001731); the Apollo Mission Control Center (THC Atlas Reference Number:
85002815); and the Space Environment Simulation Laboratory (THC Atlas Reference
Number: 85002810).
Shipwrecks, architectural resources and neighborhood surveys will not be
discussed further here, but may have to be considered in any architectural or other
surveys resulting from this project once more detailed project plans become available.

RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
Intensive pedestrian survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact
that construction processes might have on archaeological resources located within the
proposed commercial development construction area. In order to facilitate data
collection, the project area was divided into 14 numbered segments (Segments 1 through
14). Segments were defined largely by landuse; however, their location in relation to
fences, access roads, waterways and other natural and anthropogenic features was also
considered in their definition (see below). Segments were numbered in the order in
which they were surveyed (Figures 3A and 3B). Sample shovel test profiles are provided
in Figure 4. A summary of cultural resource investigations by Segment is provided in
Table 2.
SEGMENT 1
Segment 1 covered approximately 4.8 hectares (12.0 acres). It encompassed
much of the potentially undisturbed forested area east of the Hot Water Canal area (see
Figure 3). Wetland areas within the segment were not considered part of the APE and
only visually inspected. The entire segment was subjected to walkover, which
determined that parts of the segment were disturbed by clearly marked pipeline and
powerline easements. In addition, the placement of riprap, modern trash dumping, and
periodic flooding along Clear Creek have also impacted the entire southern half of
Segment 1 which lies southeast of the wetland (see Figure 3). A total of 17 shovel tests
were excavated along 5 transects in three undisturbed areas in the northern half of the
segment. A typical shovel test, as represented by Shovel Test B4, displayed a soil profile
exhibiting Ap-Btg horizonation typical of the Verland series (see Figure 4). All shovel
tests were negative for cultural material and several penetrated the Btg-horizon.

SEGMENT 2
Segment 2 was a grass covered pasture with a few widely scattered young trees
and bushes in it that covered approximately 19.4 hectares (48.0 acres). It encompassed a
rectangular area south of a pine tree farm bordering NASA Road 1, east of the NASA
Road 1 Bypass and a series of pipeline easements along the western project and segment
boundary (see Segment 4, below; see Figure 3), west of the access road along the North
Clear Creek Canal (see Segment 8, below; see Figure 3), and northwest of an access road
parallel to a high tension power line originating at Substation 2 (see Figure 3). Due to the
low potential for cultural resources in the segment, intensive pedestrian survey of the
segment consisted of walkover at 30-meter (98-foot) intervals and excavation of a total of
13 shovel tests along 3 survey transects spaced 120-meters (132- feet) apart. A typical
shovel test, as represented by Shovel Test C2, displayed a Lake Charles clay soil profile
exhibiting Ap-Bg1 horizonation (see Figure 4). Ap-horizons were up to 82 centimeters
(32 inches) thick, suggesting the area had once been a rice farm. All 13 shovel tests were
negative for cultural material, and the deepest penetrated to a depth of 1-meter, well into
the Lake Charles Bg1 horizon.

Portions of Site 41HR189 are mapped in Project Area Segments 1, 8, and 13 but the site could not be relocated in any of
these segments and has most likely been destroyed by construction.

A total of 72 survey shovel tests were initially excavated in Segment 13 during which portions of previously recorded Site
41HR189 could not be relocated and newly recorded Sites 41HR1004 and 41HR1005 were identified. Excavation of a
total of 29 radial shovel tests to delineate the two newly recorded sites brought the total shovel tests excavated in Segment
13 to 101.

SEGMENT 3
Segment 3 covered approximately 2.8 hectares (7.0 acres). It encompassed an
area consisting largely of a machine planted tree farm planted south of NASA Road 1,
west of Sarah Deel Drive, north of Segment 2, and east of a storage yard associated with
the construction of the NASA Road 1 Bypass. The segment is cross-cut by previously
surveyed portions of the ROW of the NASA Road 1 Bypass, which are considered part of
Segment 4 (see below; see Figure 3).
Pedestrian survey found the entire segment to be highly disturbed by machine
planting of pine trees using deep plows in closely spaced rows (see Figure 3, Plate 3B-2)
and modern utility easements parallel to NASA Road 1. Machine planting of pine trees is
highly disruptive of the upper 60 centimeters (24 inches) of soil. As a result no shovel
tests were excavated in this segment.

SEGMENT 4
Segment 4 covered approximately 18.2 hectares (45.0 acres) of previously
surveyed property (TxDOT 1996). It encompassed the entire ROW of the NASA Road 1
Bypass and an associated storage yard (see Figure 3). Maps provided at the time of
survey did not indicate the position of the ROW of NASA Road 1 bypass. Therefore,
visual inspection and windshield survey of Segment 4 were conducted in the course of
pedestrian survey of bounding segments to verify the location of Segment 4 in relation to
the current project boundary. These inspections indicated that portions of Segment 4 had
been disturbed by construction of high-tension towers and pipeline easements prior to
construction of the NASA Road 1 Bypass (see Figures 2 and 3).

SEGMENT 5
Segment 5 covered approximately 31.6 hectares (78.0 acres) and consisted of all
of the grounds of the Genco (formerly the Webster) Generating Station facility, including
Substation 1, and other structures and appurtenances lying inside a roughly rectangular
chain link fence. The segment can be subdivided into three parts (northern, central, and
southern) based on landuse (see Figure 3).
The northern third of Segment 5 consists mostly of rows of machine planted pine
trees similar to those in Segment 3. Three railroad sidings servicing the power plant,
underground utility lines, and two short access roads also traverse this portion of Segment
5. The central portion of Segment 5 is largely paved over and contains the main Genco
Generating Station and associated buildings, a powerline substation with numerous hightension powerlines, and a number of pipeline appurtenances tied to above and
underground pipelines that traverse the plant area. Several buildings are still operational
but much of the facility is in the process of being disassembled. The North Clear Creek

31

and Hot Water Canals have a common origin in two cement lined drainage ditches
located in the central portion of Segment 5 (see Figures 2, 3A and 3B).
The southern third of Segment 5 is landscaped and contoured and covered largely
in mowed grass. Four large earthen detention basins, two cement detention basins, an
abandoned above ground storage tank pad site, access roads and a parking lot and several
pipeline appurtenances tied to clearly marked buried pipelines are present in this part of
the segment. The South Clear Creek Canal, (the embankment of which is visible in aerial
photographs in Figure 2, also has its origin in this part of Segment 5, and traverses the
segment to eventually empty into Clear Creek (see Figures 2 and 3A).
Segment 5 is largely mapped in the Beaumont-Urban soil complex. Walkover
and windshield survey confirmed aerial photo observations that indicated the area is
highly disturbed by construction of the power plant facility, landscaping, deep plowing
associated with tree planting, and construction of artificial drainages including the three
canals. No shovel testing was conducted in Segment 5 because these observations
indicated that any archaeological resources that may have been present in the plant
grounds have been highly disturbed by construction.

SEGMENT 6
Segment 6 (see Figure 3A) covered approximately 6.1 hectares (15.0 acres). It
encompassed all of the largely wooded area west of the South Clear Creek Canal, south
of the main plant facility (Segment 5) fence, east of Old Galveston Road and north of
Clear Creek. Much of the area is disturbed by canal construction and by clearly marked
underground pipeline ROWs that are covered in grass. In addition, two small wetlands
tied by a narrow stretch of the north bank of Clear Creek are present at the southern end
of the segment (see Figures 2 and 3A).
Walkover of Segment 6 determined that two small tree covered portions of
Segment 6 (Subsegments 6A and 6B) were minimally disturbed (see Figure 3A). Both
subsegments were subjected to intensive pedestrian survey that included excavation of
shovel tests.
Subsegment 6A is a flat stretch of tree and brush covered upland lying east of an
artificial drainage ditch, west of the Canal, and just south of the chain link fence. The
area appears to be in use as a children’s’ play area and contains several play “forts” and
modern trash. It appeared to have been graded or landscaped flat in the recent past, and
was investigated to determine if a house site was once present.
Subsegment 6B is a narrow ridge lying near Clear Creek. Some old cedar trees
were present on the ridge, and a large push pile of cement riprap containing roadbed
and/or house pad fragments lay near them. The area was investigated to determine if a
house was once present at this location. Due to the relatively high elevation and

32

proximity to Clear Creek of Subsegment 6B the area also seemed a suitable location for a
prehistoric site.
In all, a total of five shovel tests were excavated along two survey transects in
Subsegment 6A; and a total of four shovel tests were excavated along one survey transect
in Subsegment 6B. A typical shovel test in the segment, as represented by Shovel Test
A1 displayed a Verland series soil profile consisting of a 20-centimeter (8-inch) thick Ap
horizon composed of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, underlain by an
extremely hard Btg horizon composed of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay (see Figure 4).
All shovel tests were negative for cultural material and no evidence of any structures was
detected.

SEGMENT 7
Segment 7 was the smallest segment in the project area (see Figure 3B). It
covered approximately 0.4 hectares (1.0 acres). It encompassed two small fenced former
pastures inside a loop formed by NASA Road 1, South Sarah Deel Drive, and Knights
Bridge Lane, near the northern end of the project area (see Figure 3B). The potentially
undisturbed center of the segment was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey including
the excavation of total of two shovel tests along one survey transect. Both shovel tests
displayed a typical Lake Charles clay soil profile exhibiting Ap-Bg1 horizonation. Each
penetrated into a Lake Charles Bg1 horizon composed of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) hard
clay. Both shovel tests and were negative for cultural material.

SEGMENT 8
Segment 8 was a linear strip of pipeline and powerline easements and access
roads just inside the eastern boundary of the project area. This segment also includes the
access roads and embankments of the North Clear Creek and Hot Water Canal, which are
large levees of Ijam Soils. It covers approximately 50.1 hectares (126 acres) extending
from Clear Creek northwestward to NASA Road 1 (see Figures 2, 3A and 3B).
Pedestrian and windshield survey of Segment 8 indicated that the utility easements are
clearly marked, and that the embankments along the canals also cover a number of
pipelines. Therefore, all of Segment 8 was designated a “No Dig” zone and found to be
highly disturbed by powerline, pipeline, and canal construction. Tree planting apparently
aimed at stabilizing the embankments after construction also appears to have disturbed
the segment, and Ijam soils appear to dominate the embankments. No cultural resources
are likely to be preserved in Segment 8.

SEGMENT 9
Segment 9 was a grass covered pasture with a few widely scattered young trees
and bushes in it that covered approximately 8.9 hectares (22.0 acres). It encompassed a

33

rectangular area south east of Segment 2 and north west of Segment 10 (see Figure 3B).
As with Segment 2, the eastern and western boundaries of Segment 9 were Segments 4
and 8, respectively (see Figure 3B).
Due to the low potential for cultural resources in the segment, intensive pedestrian
survey of the segment consisted of walkover at 30-meter (98-foot) intervals and
excavation of a total of six shovel tests along one survey transect oriented northeast to
southwest across the middle of the segment. A typical shovel test displayed a Lake
Charles clay soil profile exhibiting Ap-Bg1 horizonation similar to those in Segment 2.
All six shovel tests were negative for cultural material. The deepest penetrated a Lake
Charles A horizon to 37-centimeters (14.5-inches) depth before hitting the water table.

SEGMENT 10
Segment 10 was a grass covered pasture (see Figures 2 and 3B) with a few widely
scattered young trees and bushes in it that covered approximately 23.1 hectares (57.0
acres). It encompassed three pastures separated by access roads and fences north and east
of the fenced and gated power plant compound (Segment 5) and northwest of a forested
area east of the Plant (Segment 11). As with Segments 2 and 9 its eastern and western
boundaries were Segments 4 and 8, respectively (see Figure 3B).
Due to the low potential for cultural resources in the segment, intensive pedestrian
survey of the segment consisted of walkover at 30-meter (98-foot) intervals and
excavation of a total of 12 shovel tests along 2 of 4 survey transects oriented northeast to
southwest across the segment. At the time of survey, a small portion of the segment was
inundated while a second portion was fenced and contained livestock (see Figure 3B).
These two small areas were not subjected to shovel testing or walkover (see Figure 3B)
but were visually inspected.
No cultural resources were detected in the segment, and the majority of shovel
tests revealed soil profiles characteristic of thick Lake Charles clay and Beaumont series
clay Ap horizons. As in Segment 9, all tests were shallow, and stuck the water table at
depths between 28 and 37 centimeters (11 and 14.5 inches).

SEGMENT 11
Segment 11 was a roughly triangular shaped segment that covered approximately
4.8 hectares (12 acres) and was similar in character and elevation to Segment 12 (see
Figures 1, 2 and 3B). Segment 11 encompassed a forested area east of Segment 5, south
of Segment 10 and west of a portion of Segment 8 containing the southern terminus of
the North Clear Creek Canal. Pedestrian survey indicated that portions of the segment
along its boundary with Segment 8 were disturbed by construction that included disposal
of old roadbed fragments, possibly used as riprap, in an area previously surveyed by
McGuff (1973). Two clearly marked pipeline easements also cut across portions of the

34

parcel, and a series of livestock pens containing calves and livestock were present along
part of the segment’s boundary with Segment 10 (see Figures 1, 2 and 3B).
Walkover also indicated that the area was wooded pastureland characterized by
low pimple mounds separated by wider intermound areas. Based on the walkover, a total
of eight shovel tests were excavated along four survey transects. The units were placed
on pimple mounds and other areas or relatively high elevation between low intermound
areas (see Figure 3B). All of the shovel tests in Segment 11 displayed typical Verland
series soil profiles (see soil descriptions above) exhibiting Ap-Btg-Btg zonation.
Disturbances observed in tests appear to be limited to the Ap-horizon and to be caused by
cattle grazing when soil is wet. All shovel tests were negative for cultural material.

SEGMENT 12
Segment 12 was a roughly triangular shaped wooded area that covered
approximately 2.8 hectares (7 acres) between the Segment 5 fence and the Hot Water
Canal. Two pipeline ROWs which traverse the segment, a few small appurtenances near
the fence, an artificial drainage ditch parallel to the Hot Water Canal, and a barbed wire
fence supported by wooden posts, are the only disturbances to the segment. Much of it
seemed to be undisturbed intermound area between a few low pimple mounds. A total of
11 shovel tests were excavated along four survey transects in this segment (see Figure
3A). All of the shovel tests in Segment 12 displayed typical Verland series soil profiles
(see soil descriptions above), with profiles in less disturbed tests exhibiting Ap-Btg-Btg
zonation and more disturbed tests having thicker Ap-horizons caused by ground
disturbance apparently associated with nearby construction. All shovel tests were
negative for cultural material.

SEGMENT 13
Segment 13 occupies approximately 26.3 hectares (26.3 acres) of a larger wooded
circular area bounded by Clear Creek to the south and east, the Hot Water Canal and
Segments 5 and 12 to the north, and the South Clear Creek Canal to the west (See Figure
3A). Along Clear Creek there are two earthen berms owned by the State of Texas and
several wetlands, some of which are associated with the (CCEF’s) Clear Creek (TX)
Restoration Project. The largest of the wetlands is fan shaped and situated at and above
the mouth of a natural tributary of clear Creek that roughly divides the circular segment
in half. The wetlands and berms are outside the APE and are not considered part of the
project area or Segment 13 (See Figures 2 and 3A).
Walkover of Segment 13 identified several modern disturbances including
pipeline ROWs and pipeline appurtenances, as well as several piles of cement riprap and
discarded electrical pole fragment. These were detected mostly along the northern edges
of the segment in an area previously surveyed by Mercado-Allinger (1983) where it
bounds Segments 8 and 5 (see Figures 1, 2 and 3A). The pipeline ROWs were clearly

35

labeled. The walkover in the southern half of the segment also detected what appeared to
be abandoned roadways that may predate the power plant. The best preserved of these
runs roughly parallel to the tributary drainage along the uplands south of the artificial
wetland (see Figures 2 and 3A). A stand of old cedar trees, and several stands of older
oak trees and other hardwoods were also observed in topographically high areas
suggesting the area may have once contained historic structures or farmsteads.
As a result of the moderate potential to detect historic resources a total of 72
shovel tests were excavated along seven survey transects in Segment 13 (see Figure 3).
Tests were more closely spaced in high potential upland areas bordering drainages where
Atasco series soils are mapped (see Figure 2). A typical shovel test in such an upland
area is represented by Shovel Test C2, which was extended into a pimple mound with an
auger to a depth of 210 centimeters (82.7 inches). This test revealed a sandy Atasco
series soil profile consisting of fine sand Ap and E horizons overlying a clayier Bt
horizon. Shovel tests placed further away from drainages had loamier Ap horizons
underlain by clay and sandy clay E and Bt horizons characteristic of Atasco series soils or
Btg-Btg horizons characteristic of Verland series soils such as that shown in Figure 4.
Testing could not relocate portions of previously recorded Site 41HR189 mapped
in this segment, and all of the shovel tests excavated away from Clear Creek were
negative for cultural resources. However, shovel tests A2, B2, C1 and E1 placed near the
edge of the terraces closest to Clear Creek were positive for cultural materials.
Excavation of a total of 29 radial shovel tests around these positive tests resulted in the
identification and delineation of two previously unrecorded sites (Sites 41HR1004 and
41HR1005; see Figure 2), both of which are described below.

SEGMENT 14
Segment 14 is roughly rectangular in shape and covered approximately 14.6
hectares (36.0 acres). It encompassed all of the area north of Landolt Road west of Old
Galveston Road, and south and east of the railroad tracks and the railroad siding leading
to the Genco Generating Station (see Figures 2, 3A and 3B). The area is relatively flat
upland that is largely covered in brush except along a wooded partly natural and partly
channelized drainage that parallels the railroad tracks and State Highway 3. Three rows
of high-tension wire towers traverse the parcel, and a small forest of machine planted
pine trees similar to those in Segments 3 and 5 is present in the southern part of the parcel
(see Figures 3A and 3B).
Due to its location near a natural drainage and Old Galveston Road, and the
apparent lack of disturbances outside of the pine trees and the high tension wire towers, a
total of 18 shovel tests were excavated along two survey transects in this parcel. A
typical shovel test displayed either A-Bg horizonation as described for the Lake Charles
clay, or Ap-Bg-Bssg horizonation typical of the Beaumont clay. All 18 shovel tests were
negative for cultural material, and penetrated culturally sterile lower Bg-horizons in both
the Beaumont clay and Lake Charles-Urban soils mapped there (see Figure 2).

NEWLY IDENTIFIED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
Investigations in much of the project area detected disturbances from natural and
anthropogenic process that are highly likely to have destroyed the integrity of cultural
resources that may have been present. However, two terraces along Clear Creek
produced cultural materials that were recorded as Sites 41HR1004 and 41HR1005.

SITE 41HR1004
Site 41HR1004 (Figure 5) is a prehistoric terrace site of Middle Archaic to Late
Prehistoric age measuring approximately 10 by 80 meters (33 by 262 feet). The site was
identified on the basis of subsurface remains detected during intensive pedestrian survey.
The site is situated on what appeared to be series of small, low mounds located within ten
meters of the crest of a terrace northeast of the (CCEF’s) Clear Creek (TX) Restoration
Project artificial wetland (see Figures 1, 2, 3A and 4). The site is bounded to the south
and west by a sloping terrace riser leading down to the wetland. The north and east
boundaries of the site were defined on the basis of the excavation of two consecutive
negative shovel tests in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests (see Figure 5).
No cultural features were detected in association with the site, and it appears to be
restricted to a depth of 5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches) below surface. Artifacts were
only recovered from the A horizon which was only well developed on the low mounds.
Intermound areas contained weakly developed A/E horizons underlain by a Bg horizon
that underlies the A/E horizons across the site.
Initially a total of six shovel tests (Shovel Tests A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2) were
excavated in the vicinity of the site (see Figure 3). The discovery of a projectile point in
the A horizon in Shovel Test A2, along with chert flakes in the A horizon in shovel tests
B1 and C1 resulted in the excavation of a series of 14 radial shovel tests around the
positive shovel tests to delineate the site. One of these radial shovel tests, Radial Shovel
Test RA2S, was positive, producing five fragments of grog tempered prehistoric pottery.
A summary of cultural materials recovered from Site 41HR1004 is provided in Table 3,
and the distribution of tests is shown in Figure 5. Two diagnostic artifacts recovered
from the site can be seen in Plate 1.

Much of the projectile point recovered from Shovel Test A2 was preserved,
except for a portion of the base, which appears to have broken off while being knapped
(see Plate 1). It is made of a creamy white to light gray fossiliferous chert, while the
other chert recovered from the site was grayish brown and translucent and more typical of
chert found at other sites along Clear Creek, including materials found recently at
41GV157 a few miles downstream near the mouth of Robinsons Bayou with Clear Creek
(see Pickering 2005). Based on its overall morphology the point most closely resembles
Kent or Gary dart points (cf. Turner and Hester 1993:123-124,136), which can date from
the Middle Archaic into the Late Prehistoric period. Kent points have been dated from
the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric (circa 4500 to 1600 B.P.), while Gary
Points date between the Middle Archaic and the Early Ceramic (circa 4500 to 2000 B.P.)
(Turner and Hester 1993:45-63).
The five pottery sherds recovered from Shovel Test RA2S may all be derived
from the same vessel. They appear to be Goose Creek pottery, which dates from the
Early to the Late Ceramic period (circa 200 to 2000 B.P.) in age (see Ricklis 2004:192196, table 6.11).
Given the chronology of diagnostic materials, the materials from the site may
represent a single component Early Ceramic site. If the recovered point is a Kent the
site’s lithic materials could date from the Middle Archaic to the Tchula periods (roughly
3000 to 2000 B.P.) (see Ricklis 2004:192-196, table 6.11).
With the exception of one chert flake recovered from Shovel Test C1, all of the
artifacts recovered from Site 41HR1004 were recovered from low mounds. Shovel tests
excavated around the periphery of the mounds quickly penetrated an A/E horizon and
reached what appeared to be impenetrable clays associated with the Bg horizon which
likely marks the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. The absence of substantial A and E
horizons over much of the site area, young trees, evidence of use of the area as a picnic
area in the recent past, and the remnants of pipeline and drilling facilities in close
proximity to the site (see Figure 3) suggests that the low mounds are remnants of a more
continuous terrace that was impacted by modern construction and natural erosion. The
low artifact density possibly marks infrequent use of the site by prehistoric peoples or it
may be indicative of erosion of what may have once been a denser cultural deposit.
It should also be noted that Site 41HR1004 lies below the 100 year flood contour
in close proximity to the artificial wetland, and that it will most likely not be impacted by
the proposed undertaking. The low elevation makes it unsuitable for cost-effective
development (see construction limit line and flood contour on Figure 3A).

SITE 41HR1005
Site 41HR1005 (Figure 6) is a mixed historic and prehistoric site of indeterminate
age measuring approximately 20 by 25 meters (66 by 80 feet). The site was identified on
the basis of subsurface remains detected during intensive pedestrian survey. It is situated

40

on what appears to be a knoll lying above the 100-year flood contour on a terrace along
Clear Creek (see Figures 3A and 6). The site is bounded to the south by the artificial
wetland lying between the state owned berms and Clear Creek (see Figures 1 and 2). The
north, west, and east boundaries of the site were identified on the basis of the excavation
of two consecutive negative shovel tests in cardinal directions from positive shovel tests
or by signs of erosion along slopes to drainages around the knoll (see Figure 6).
The site appears to be restricted to a depth of 5 to 60 centimeters (2 to 24 inches)
below surface. Artifacts and ecofacts (Plates 3 through 6) were recovered from the A, E
and upper Bg horizons of an Atasco series soil, which is well developed across the site.
Rangia valves and other shell fragments were detected in association with the site at
depths between 15 and 60 centimeters (6 and 24 inches).
The site was detected when excavation of Shovel Test E1 on the site (see Figure
3) produced a fragmentary brass .32 or smaller caliber rimfire bullet cartridge casing.
Although the casing was too deteriorated for a reliable date, the discovery of the historic
artifact resulted in the excavation of four radial shovel tests around the positive test.
Three of these tests were positive for prehistoric materials including debitage, Rangia
shell and burned bone fragments. Based on these finds a total of 18 radial shovel tests
were excavated on a grid to delineate the site.
Five of the radial shovel tests (Radial Shovel Tests 0W10S, 7E0N, 8E10S, 8320S,
and 15E10S) were positive for cultural materials, mostly ecofacts which were largely
Rangia shell fragments, along with three burned bone fragments from Shovel Test
0W10S. Artifacts in shovel tests included two primary chert flakes recovered from
Shovel Test 7E0N.
All of the positive shovel tests were spaced very close to one
another (see Figure 5). No additional historic materials were recovered from the site, and
all of the materials recovered are summarized in Table 4.
The densest concentrations of Rangia appeared to form an approximately 5centimeter (2-inch) thick shell midden at an average depth of 30 centimeters (12 inches)
below surface. This midden was well developed in Shovel Test 8E20S (see Figure 5)
where it was designated Feature 1. Due to the recovery of what appears to be baked
Rangia valves and burned animal bone from the shovel test (see Plate 3), both of which
are possibly radiocarbon datable materials, a single 50 centimeter by 50 centimeter (19.7
inch by 19.7 inch) test unit (designated Test Unit 1) was also excavated at the site (Figure
7). This was done as a preliminary assessment of site integrity (see Figure 3). The test
unit produced a variety of materials that are also listed in Table 4.

Temporally diagnostic prehistoric materials recovered from Test Unit 1 were
limited to one grog tempered pottery sherd, and several pottery crumbs or lumps of
burned clay of similar composition (see Plate 3). Grog tempered pottery in the region
dates to the Late Prehistoric period (cf. Ricklis 2004:table 6.11).
Lithic materials recovered from Test Unit 1 were not diagnostic but included three
tools (2 mid-to-late stage bifaces large enough to be dart points, 1 unifacial utilized
flake), and small quantities of debitage. Rangia and baked clay were also recovered from
the test unit, and Feature 1 was also apparently present in Test Unit 1 (see Figures 6 and 7
and Plates 3-6).
As a result of these investigations Site 41HR1005 appears to possess prehistoric
cultural materials including artifacts and ecofacts in intact contexts. These include
possibly heated Rangia, burned bone, and burned clay that may be datable using
radiocarbon dating methods. However, further work would be necessary to determine the
site’s eligibility for the National Register.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on 215 hectares (531 acres) of property proposed for development along Clear
Creek in Harris County, Texas. Property associated with this project has been heavily
impacted by activities associated with construction of the Genco (formerly the Webster)
Generating Station.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current project area. Two
previously recorded archaeological sites (41HR189, 41HR190) were identified within the
project area. In addition, 12 previously identified archaeological sites (41GV10,
41GV17, 41GV53, 41GV55, 41GV56, 41GV76, 41GV78, 41GV79, 41GV100,
41GV142, 41GV149 and 41HR529); one shipwreck, and 12 neighborhood surveys were
recorded within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. These resources are not
located within the current project’s APE, and will not be affected by construction.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, shovel testing and
photo-documentation. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 197 shovel
tests in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 30 to 210
centimeters (12 to 84 inches). This total number includes shovel tests excavated in and
around the previously platted boundaries of Sites 41HR189 and 41HR190 in an attempt
to relocate and further delineate these sites, as well as 29 radial shovel tests placed near
two archaeological sites (41HR1004 and 41HR1005) recorded during this project.
The shovel tests supported evidence from other archaeological sites in the region,
and from County soil reports (cf. Crenwelge et al. 1988; Wheeler 1976) that indicate the
Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in this part of Harris County lies close to the surface, and
is accessible by conventional shovel testing methods.
The two previously recorded archaeological sites (41GV189 and 41GV190) could
not be relocated and appear to have been destroyed by recent construction in the area.
However, during this investigation, previously unrecorded cultural remains (41HR1004
and 41HR1005) were located within the project area.
Site 41HR1004 is a small Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric age subsurface site
situated at the crest of a terrace at the confluence of an unnamed stream and Clear Creek.
Shovel tests produced a Gary or Kent projectile point, four Goose Creek ware potsherds,
and two chert flakes at depths of 7 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) from the A/E
horizons of an Atasco series soil. Due to low artifact density, evidence of erosion, and
modern disturbance to the site, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further

46

archaeological work be required at 41HR1004. Site 41HR1004 does not have the
potential to contain data important to an understanding of prehistory in the region.
Site 41HR1005 is a small multicomponent prehistoric and historic subsurface site,
consisting of a thin Rangia midden situated on a flat knob formed by minor drainages
dissecting a terrace along the north bank of Clear Creek. Artifacts recovered from
41HR1005 included two late stage chert bifaces, one unifacial flake tool, one grog
tempered potsherd, four pieces of debitage, four fragments of burned clay, and three
burned animal bone fragments recovered at depths of 15 to 60 centimeters (6 to 24
inches) from the A, E and upper Bt horizons of an Atasco series soil. The A horizon also
produced a single corroded and fragmentary .32 or smaller caliber brass rimfire cartridge
(ca.1861-present), the length of which could not be determined.
The Rangia midden appears to be approximately 5-centimeters (2-inches) thick
and lies at an average depth of approximately 30 centimeters (12 inches). It is not very
dense but may cover an area as large as 130 square meters (1,399 square feet). Though
artifact density is low, evidence of possible cooking of bone and shell, heating of chert,
and minimal disturbance to the site, suggests the site does have the potential to yield
information important to an understanding of prehistory in the area, including possibly
cultural materials such as shell and charcoal that are suitable for radiocarbon dates.
Eligibility testing would be appropriate for Site 41HR1005 given its cultural
resource potential. However, current project plans (Figure 8) indicate that Site
41HR1005 will be avoided by construction, and be part of 37 acres of GLO Open Space.
Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that the project be cleared to proceed as long
as current construction plans do not change.
Artifacts from both sites will be temporarily stored at the Houston office of HRA
Gray & Pape. Following the completion of this project, it is anticipated that all artifacts
will be returned to the landowners.
